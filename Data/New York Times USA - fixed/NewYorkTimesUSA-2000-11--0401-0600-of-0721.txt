HEADLINE: Distributor of Flu Vaccine Comes Under Fire

BYLINE: By MELODY PETERSEN

 BODY:
With flu vaccine in short supply nationwide, customers of one big distributor say their longstanding orders are going unfilled while other customers that ordered only recently, but at higher prices, are getting the medication.
The distributor, Henry Schein Inc., and its subsidiaries are the exclusive suppliers in the United States of vaccine made by Medeva, a British company that is the only flu vaccine producer that has not had manufacturing problems this year. 
 Some Schein customers that ordered early, at low prices, said in interviews over the last week that they had received only partial shipments or no vaccine at all. At the same time, Schein is taking new orders at higher prices, and at least some of those orders have been quickly delivered.
Schein, which is based in Melville, N.Y., said yesterday that its policy was to first fill orders placed early by doctors, and then to fill other early orders, like those of state governments.
Susan Vasallo, a spokeswoman for Schein, said she could not explain why the company was shipping vaccine to some customers that placed orders only in the last few weeks.
"We are trying to fulfill orders as best we can," Ms. Vasallo said. "There probably are some exceptions. How many of those took place I could not say. But those are the exceptions, not the rule."
Flu vaccinations have been delayed around the nation this year because of the difficulties that other companies had in making the vaccine. With health care providers desperate for vaccine, prices have shot up.
Delays in shipments of vaccine ordered by the state of California have led Representative Gary A. Condit, a Democrat, to ask the General Accounting Office to investigate.
"Any price manipulations that may put profit ahead of the health and well-being of the American people is simply wrong," Mr. Condit said this week. "We think the distribution of the vaccine should be fair. It should not be awarded to the highest bidder."
By last week, the California Department of Health Services had received only about 35 percent of the 700,000 doses of vaccine that it ordered in February, at $1.80 each, from a Schein subsidiary, General Injectables and Vaccines. Flu clinics across the state have been postponed.
"This has put our clinics in a very difficult situation," said Dr. Natalie J. Smith, chief of the department's immunization branch.
By contrast, General Injectables delivered all the vaccine that the state of Maine had ordered -- 123,500 doses at either $3.10 or $3.99 each, about twice as much as California's price, according to Paul Kuehnert, director of the Maine division of disease control. Maine placed its order in June, about four months later than California, and received it in early September.
In addition, an order placed a few weeks ago by Dr. Stephen Dickey at the Doctors Walk-in Clinics in Tampa, Fla., for about 3,000 doses at about $7.50 each, was delivered last week, Dr. Dickey said. That order was filled by another Schein unit, Caligor.
Ms. Vasallo said she could not comment on individual customers' cases, but she insisted that Schein was not delivering vaccine based on the price paid. "That is not the policy," she said.
"The price has gone up as the season has progressed," Ms. Vasallo acknowledged. But she said that Medeva had also increased its price. "Our costs have gone up," she said.
Powderject Pharmaceuticals, a company in Oxford, England, that bought Medeva in October, said that Schein had discretion to set the sales price of vaccine in the United States. "From what we understand, they are making every effort to fulfill their customers' orders," a spokeswoman for Powderject said yesterday.
Medeva is expected to sell about 15 million of the 75 million doses of flu vaccine that will eventually be available in the United States this flu season. Unlike Aventis and American Home Products, the other vaccine makers, Medeva had no problems producing flu vaccine this year and has been shipping it to Schein on schedule, Rob Budge, a spokesman for Powderject, said this month.
Ms. Vasallo said that Schein had also placed orders with the other vaccine makers, and therefore did not yet have all the vaccine it was counting on.
Dr. Smith, the California health official, said that when she heard this summer that some vaccine shipments would be delayed because of manufacturing problems she was relieved that California had ordered the vaccine made by Medeva.
General Injectables had told state officials that it would try to deliver the vaccine in August, and no later than Sept. 15, she said. The company later told California that its order would be complete by October, so that vaccination clinics could be held as scheduled.
With the arrival of thousands of additional doses on Wednesday, the state has now received about 65 percent of its order, Dr. Smith said, and is anxiously awaiting more.
Also waiting are hundreds of customers of Insource, another Schein subsidiary, that have not received any vaccine. Many of them are regional medical distributors that sell to doctors' offices and clinics.
Michael Jekoski, vice president for sales at Delaware Valley Surgical Supply in Boothwyn, Pa., said his company had ordered 5,000 vials of drug vaccine from Insource early this spring at a price "in the low $20's" for each vial, containing 10 doses. The company then took orders to sell the vaccine to doctors' offices at prices "in the mid to upper $20's" per vial, Mr. Jekoski said.
"We have been left with nothing to give physicians," he said.

HEADLINE: World Trade Talks Revived By Pacific Rim Conference

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

DATELINE: BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Brunei, Nov. 16

 BODY:
Efforts to restart global trade talks, which failed in Seattle last year amid riots, received a push today when 21 nations of the Asia and Pacific region agreed to set a date of 2001 to form an agenda and begin negotiations for eliminating trade barriers.
The agreement reached by leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, or APEC, was a victory for the Clinton administration, which has made free trade a top priority and has often used this Pacific Rim forum to press its free-trade agenda. 
 The accord ensures that no matter who wins the White House, or who succeeds other departing leaders of APEC, a mandate and deadline have been set for reviving trade talks.
"We believe that a balanced and sufficiently broad-based agenda that responds to the interests and concerns of all World Trade Organization members should be formulated and finalized as soon as possible in 2001, and that a round be launched in 2001," the leaders said in a statement.
But the agreement amounted to little more than a consensus that the talks must restart. It did not address the subject that blew up the Seattle meeting, the fears among developing nations that the United States would impose labor and environmental standards that would undercut the competitiveness of poorer nations.
Saying they were tired of being railroaded into agreements that were not in their best interest, the developing nations, led by Malaysia, initially insisted on seeing an agenda before agreeing to a fixed starting date for negotiations.
After two days of heated debate, mainly by United States and Brunei leaders, a compromise was reached that both the agenda and initiation of talks would be achieved by next year.
It was the first time that the group had met in this oil-rich sultanate of 300,000 people who have one of the highest standards of living in Southeast Asia but are governed by an absolute monarchy, the Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah. Known for his gilded palaces, fleets of luxury cars and other excesses, the sultan, in a speech to delegates, warned that "disparities between the rich and poor continue to grow, and many people are at risk of being marginalized."
Still, the sultan treated the regional heads of state to ornate pins of gold and precious stones and in keeping with an APEC tradition, matching wacky shirts -- the color was deep blue this year.
For President Clinton, who is widely recognized as having been the driving force behind the group, the forum marked what was likely his last meeting with many world leaders. Today, Mr. Clinton met separately with the Japanese prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, and President Jiang Zemin of China.
Aides to Mr. Clinton said that in his meeting with Mr. Mori, the two leaders mainly discussed the situation in North Korea, but that the president also expressed opposition to Japan's stepped-up whaling activities.
White House aides said that Mr. Clinton discussed nonproliferation issues with the Chinese leader, and aides indicated a significant development was in the works.
Mr. Clinton and Singapore's prime minister, Goh Chok Tong, agreed to negotiate a free-trade agreement between their nations that would be modeled after a recent accord between the United States and Jordan that removed all trade barriers between the two countries.
If that deal is approved by Congress, Jordan would become only the fourth country with which the United States has a free-trade agreement. The others are Canada, Mexico and Israel. United States officials said they hope to complete the Singapore agreement by the end of the year.
Separate pacts like the one the United States has proposed with Singapore are seen as helping to pave the way for the larger APEC free trade agreement. It is an ambitious goal that would create the world's largest free-trade zone, embracing four continents and encompassing more than half the world's population, economy and commerce.
But the Malaysian prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, had a different view. He said that it was important for developing countries in Asia to form their own individual trade blocs to combat what he called the dominance of regional powers. The prime minister, who is an outspoken critic of the impact of globalization on the developing world, said that small countries like Malaysia often have difficulty putting forth their case at regional trade forums. He said that groupings of these smaller countries would be in a better position to exert pressure on more developed countries and have their problems heard.
In their final communique, APEC leaders also expressed concern over rising oil prices, urged countries recovering from the Asian financial crisis to continue their economic reforms and called for new efforts by the public and private sectors to help bridge the so-called digital divide.
Noticeably absent from the meeting were antiglobalization protesters that have disrupted other world trade meetings in recent years. Organizers said that the demonstrators might have been put off by Brunei's remoteness and authoritarian rule.

HEADLINE: Key House Leader Withdraws Support for Colombia Aid Plan

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS with JUAN FORERO

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 16

 BODY:
Representative Benjamin A. Gilman, chairman of the House International Relations Committee, has abruptly withdrawn his support from the decision to funnel $1.3 billion in mostly military aid to Colombia, arguing that the United States is on the brink of a "major mistake."
Mr. Gilman, Republican of New York, sent a letter this week to the White House drug policy coordinator, Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, contending that the American plan to increase the role of the Colombian military in the drug fight will end disastrously, because the military has undermined its political support after a history of corruption and human rights abuses. That position echoes other critics of the plan. 
 Mr. Gilman called on the Clinton administration to redirect its assistance, including at least 40 Black Hawk helicopters, from the military to the national police in Colombia. Mr. Gilman has long admired the police, which he views as more effective and less tainted by human rights violations.
"If we fail early on with Plan Colombia, as I fear, we could lose the support of the American people for our efforts to fight illicit narcotics abroad," Mr. Gilman said. "If we lose public support, we will regret we did not make the mid-course corrections for Colombia that I have outlined here."
Last summer, Mr. Gilman voted to support Plan Colombia, a $7.5 billion strategy drafted jointly by American and Colombian officials and passed by Congress. In addition to the military spending, the program allocates money to promote alternative crops, economic renewal and human rights. The plan seeks to halve drug production over five years in Colombia, reportedly the source of most of the cocaine and heroin that enters the United States.
Congressional sources said Mr. Gilman was troubled by recent military failures in rural areas where rebel forces operate.
It is unclear what effects, if any, Mr. Gilman's shift will have. A Senate Republican aide who follows Colombia closely said it was "far too early" to criticize the plan. Mr. Gilman is expected to relinquish his chairmanship next year because of term limits.
Critics of the plan have argued that the military aid would merely intensify the conflict in which two rebel groups have joined forces with narcotics traffickers against the government, a conflict that could eventually draw the United States directly into fighting the rebels.
Leaders of Colombia's neighbors also have expressed fears that the fighting will spill into their countries.
Washington counters that Colombia's increasingly jumbled battle lines make it necessary to equip and deploy the military in the fight against drugs. The American plan calls for training three counternarcotics battalions, with a total of up to 3,000 troops.
The administration also has promised to watch over the military's record on human rights. A spokesman for General McCaffrey, Robert Weiner, said today that denying aid to the military on the basis of its past performance would ensure defeat.
"Granted they're not a superpower," Mr. Weiner said. "One of the major purposes of the Plan Colombia is to provide the military with the resources they need. This actually scares the cartels to death."
In southern Putumayo Province, where half of the coca in Colombia is grown, rebels have sealed off roads, arguing that the military has to rein in right-wing gunmen who are associated with the armed forces.
A botched operation in a northern town, Dabeiba, resulted last month in the downing of one of the army's seven American-made Black Hawks and the deaths of 22 troops.
The helicopter had been carrying reinforcements to assist soldiers locked in a firefight with rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. But sloppy communications led the pilot to land in a rebel-controlled area, an American official said.
The rebels "were waiting for them," the official said. "What kind of intelligence is that? They were dug in like the Ho Chi Minh Trail."
A high-ranking official in President Andres Pastrana's government defended the military involvement on the grounds that the drug war has fundamentally changed in the last five years.
"It used to be an urban drug war, which the police were very capable of handling," the official said. "It has now become a drug war fought in the jungles, and you can't do that without military support."
Another official said, "The fact that there are voices that are against these tactics doesn't mean that the strategy is going to change."

HEADLINE: Fed Cited Two Points in Holding Rates Steady in October

BYLINE: Bloomberg News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 16

 BODY:
At their October meeting, Federal Reserve policy makers unanimously approved leaving the overnight bank lending rate unchanged because of slowing economic demand and an easing of inflation pressures.
"Growth of aggregate demand now appeared to be closer to, and perhaps slightly below, the rate of expansion in the nation's output potential," central bankers said, according to minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Oct. 3, which were released today. 
 "Moreover, cost pressures and price inflation had remained subdued for an extended period despite low rates of unemployment that in the past had been associated with increasing inflation," the minutes said.
At the October meeting, the committee voted to keep the target rate for overnight loans between banks at 6.5 percent given "indications of appreciable slowing in the pace of the expansion from outsized increases experienced in the latter part of 1999 and the first half of this year," the minutes said. The Fed raised interest rates six times between June 30, 1999, and May 16.
With demand rising less rapidly, inflation posed less of a risk, the minutes said. Yet, with unemployment at 3.9 percent in September -- matching a 30-year low set in April -- and energy costs above year-earlier levels, policy makers agreed to issue a statement after the October meeting that focused on the risk that inflation posed to the record-long economic expansion.
The minutes indicated that policy makers might be preparing to eliminate the inflationary warning.
"Some expressed the opinion that those risks were now less decidedly tilted to the upside and that a reconsideration of the sentence might be warranted over the next several months," the minutes said. Even with this view, those members "believed that a change at this point would be premature."
The minutes of the previous meeting helped shape analysts' understanding of how likely the Fed is to raise or reduce rates. The rate changes tend to affect the terms for rates on loans to consumers and businesses.

A high school senior and her boyfriend were charged yesterday with strangling the girl's mother and father in the parents' apartment in Spanish Harlem two weeks ago and then dumping their bodies, with belts still tight around their necks, in the East River last week, the authorities said.
The police said the student, Connie Leung, 17, and her boyfriend, Eric Louissaint, 20, had been dating for about a year and had recently been quarreling with Ms. Leung's parents. 
 Lt. Louis Caniglia, commander of the 23rd Detective Squad, said that on the day before the killings, Ms. Leung and her father, Stephen Leung, had argued in front of a counselor at the Manhattan Center for Science and Math on East 116th Street, where she was enrolled. Mr. Leung had been concerned that his daughter, once an A and B student, had stopped attending class to spend time with Mr. Louissaint, who is unemployed, Lieutenant Caniglia said.
Other police officials said race was also a factor in the deteriorating relationship between Ms. Leung and her parents. The police said Mr. Leung, 55, and his wife, Chilin, 41, were immigrants from Hong Kong, and were upset that their daughter was dating Mr. Louissaint, who is black.
Whatever the young couple's motive, the police said, their anger escalated so wildly that on Nov. 2 they overpowered her parents in the family's fourth-floor apartment at 2120 First Avenue.
Sgt. William Cannon, also of the 23rd Detective Squad, said Mr. Leung was the first to die. A waiter at Le Parker Meridien on West 57th Street, Mr. Leung had come home from work about 6 or 7 p.m. and dropped into a chair in his bedroom to watch television. Mr. Louissaint came from behind, slipped a belt taken from Mr. Leung's raincoat over the man's head and strangled him, the sergeant said.
For more than three hours, the young couple waited for the girl's mother, an employee of the New Good Taste II Chinese Restaurant at 1974 Second Avenue, and strangled her with a leather belt as she came through the door about 10:20 p.m., the police said.
Assistant Chief William Taylor, commander of detectives in Manhattan, said Connie Leung helped her boyfriend in both killings, but he would not say how. "We're not going to go any further with that, other than that she participated and assisted in strangling both the mother and father," he said.
Asked if Connie Leung had shown remorse in the interviews yesterday with detectives, the chief said, "No."
After the killings, the couple placed the two bodies near each other on the bedroom floor and locked the door, the police said.
Over the next several days, Ms. Leung and Mr. Louissaint sold her parents' rings and gold chains, worth about $5,000, at a Lower Manhattan pawn shop, the police said. Detectives recovered most of the jewelry.
Last week, the police said, the killers began to dispose of the bodies. First, on Tuesday night, the police said, the two stuffed the mother's body in a shopping cart, wheeled it outside and pushed the cart into the East River.
Early last Friday, the police said, the couple repeated the journey with the father's body, first stuffing it into a laundry bag, then moving it from the building in a luggage cart before tossing it into the river about 2 a.m.
Mr. Leung's body quickly floated to the surface. A passer-by saw it in the river near East 61st Street at 11 a.m. on Friday, and authorities retrieved it. Mrs. Leung's body has not been found. The police said they expected to send divers to the river's bottom to look for it.
Mr. Leung's body was not immediately identified, however, and the daughter and her boyfriend were not at first suspected of a crime.
On Monday, Mrs. Leung's sister Shirley Sung grew concerned that Connie Leung, her niece, had not been seen in nearly two weeks, and filled out a missing-person report. On Wednesday, Connie Leung's sister Teresa Leung, of Brooklyn, reported that her parents had disappeared.
Lieutenant Caniglia said detectives investigating the missing- person reports found Ms. Leung and Mr. Louissaint living at the Y.M.C.A. on West 63rd Street.
Neither Ms. Leung, who lived with her parents, nor Mr. Louissaint, formerly of Edson Avenue in the Bronx, had a criminal record, the police said. The crime confounded those who know them.
One friend who spoke on the condition of anonymity said he was a former classmate of Ms. Leung's and had known the couple for more than a year. He said Ms. Leung and Mr. Louissaint had "a classic interracial relationship" but had endured cultural tensions and her parent's initial disapproval.
He also said that Mrs. Leung had warmed to Mr. Louissaint over time, and that the relationship between the couple and the parents had gradually become congenial.
He expressed disbelief at the accusation. "How can people change that quickly?" the young man asked yesterday. "They were doing O.K. with her parents, and actually got along."

HEADLINE: COUNTING THE VOTE: DUVAL COUNTY;
Democrats Rue Ballot Foul-Up In a 2nd County

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER with JOSH BARBANEL 

DATELINE: JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Nov. 16

 BODY:
Democrats in Duval County prepared meticulously for Election Day. They registered thousands of voters and ferried enough people to the polls in predominantly African-American precincts to give a solid boost to Vice President Al Gore in a county expected to swing reliably into Gov. George W. Bush's column.
But the results of Duval County's vote left Democrats here shaking their heads. More than 26,000 ballots were invalidated, the vast majority because they contained votes for more than one presidential candidate. Nearly 9,000 of the votes were thrown out in the predominantly African-American communities around Jacksonville, where Mr. Gore scored 10-to-1 ratios of victory, according to an analysis of the vote by The New York Times. 
 The percentage of invalidated votes here was far higher than that recorded in Palm Beach County, which has become the focus of national attention and where Democrats have argued that so many people were disenfranchised it may be necessary to let them vote again. Neither Democrats nor Republicans have demanded a hand recount or new election in Duval County.
Local election officials attributed the outcome to a ballot that had the name of presidential candidates on two pages, which they said many voters found confusing. Many voters, they said, voted once on each page. The election officials said they would not use such a ballot in the future.
Rodney G. Gregory, a lawyer for the Democrats in Duval County, said the party shared the blame for the confusion. Mr. Gregory said Democratic Party workers instructed voters, many persuaded to go to the polls for the first time, to cast ballots in every race and "be sure to punch a hole on every page."
"The get-out-the vote folks messed it up," Mr. Gregory said ruefully.
If Mr. Gregory's assessment is correct, and thousands of Gore supporters were inadvertently misled into invalidating their ballots, this county alone would have been enough to give Mr. Gore the electoral votes of Florida, and thus the White House.
The voters turned out by Democrats, Mr. Gregory said, took the instructions to vote in every race to mean: "I've got to vote for Gore. I've got to be sure Bush doesn't get elected. I've got to vote on every page."
Democratic officials, Mr. Gregory said, should have told voters they were bringing to the polls. Vote for Gore, then skip the next page.
"In hindsight," he said, "we didn't fully understand the problem. "
The Duval County ballot listed Mr. Gore on the first page, along with Mr. Bush, Ralph Nader and two other candidates. Then on the second page were the names of five other presidential candidates. After voting for Mr. Gore, many Democratic voters turned the page and voted for one of the remaining names, Mr. Gregory said.
The double-marked ballots substantially affected Mr. Gore's showing, a Times analysis of voting data suggests. More than 20 percent of the votes cast in predominantly African-American precincts were tossed out, nearly triple the majority white precincts. In two largely African-American precincts, nearly one-third of the ballots were invalidated.
Altogether, 21,942 ballots were rejected because the voter punched the hole beside the name of more than one candidate, and another 4,927 were invalidated because the voter punched no hole next to a presidential candidate, said the Duval County supervisor of elections.
The Times analysis shows that about 16,500 of the votes thrown out were cast in precincts with Democratic majorities that, when taken together, were comfortably carried by Mr. Gore. The remaining 10,000 invalid votes were cast mostly in precincts in which Republicans outnumber Democrats and that were, as a group, solidly behind Mr. Bush.
When the results for Duval County were first tallied, those mathematics made it look like Duval County was a place in which Republicans could pick up some votes in a recount.
But Republican officials with ties to the Bush campaign said they concluded that it was doubtful a manual recount in Duval would, on balance, help their candidate.
The Bush campaign chairman in northeastern Florida, Michael Hightower, did not agree and said he doubted a substantial portion of the invalid ballots were cast by Gore supporters. They might be from districts where the registration was heavily Democratic, but many Democrats voted for Mr. Bush, he said.
The invalid ballots were cast "by people who did not, could not, or would not follow directions," said Mr. Hightower, an executive with Blue Cross/Blue Shield and a Bush Pioneer, which means he raised more than $100,000 for the candidate. "I am not going to make a judgment why." But he said, he believed that more than half of those who did not follow directions were Republicans.
Although there is plenty of grousing about the ballot, the Democrats have not mounted a challenge to the vote here as they have in other parts of the state. For one thing, confusing though the ballot might have been, "there is nothing illegal about that ballot," said James Holland, a lawyer who worked as a poll watcher for the Democrats on voting day.
Amandlyn Brooks, 38, was one of many voters here who said she was taken aback by the two-page presidential ballot. "It was confusing to me," she said. "It was my first time voting." She does not know which precinct or district she voted in; she had gone to the polling station the Democrats had shown her. After first making a mistake and voting for Mr. Bush, she managed, after considerable assistance, to get a new ballot, she said.
But she still was not certain what to do. "I kept looking around, pleading for help," she said. "But they just kept saying, 'read it, read it.' " Ms. Brooks said.
"I wanted to run out of there, but I was determined," she said. "So I just punched whatever. When I got home, I told my husband, I don't know who I voted for."
Stephanie Brown, an 18-year-old studying journalism at Florida Community College, also found the ballot confusing, but said she was saved from voting incorrectly by a warning from her mother, who voted just ahead of her.
But she said her 67-year-old grandmother had voted on each page, thus invalidating her ballot.
A spokesman for the Duval County elections office, Susan Tucker Johnson, said the 26,000 invalidated votes were four times the total recorded in 1996. Ms. Johnson said the county had fit the presidential candidates on one page in 1996, but had gone to two pages this year because there were so many parties. In addition to the Democratic, Republican and Green Parties, there were the Libertarian, and Socialist Workers Parties on page 1; and on page 2, the Natural Law, Reform, Socialist, Constitution and Workers World Parties, as well as a place for a write-in candidate.
In the final tally for Duval County, Mr. Bush received 152,114 votes, or 58 percent, and Mr. Gore 108,048, or 41 percent.
Democratic officials were pleased because Mr. Gore had exceeded Mr. Clinton's 35 percent showing in 1996, said Michael Langton, of the executive committee of the Duval County Democratic Party. He added, however, that he was disturbed by the number of invalid ballots from predominantly Democratic precincts.

We Won't Fall Apart

 BODY:

To the Editor:
The fear is unfounded that economic markets and international affairs will explode while we go about our messy work of assuring that Florida voters' rights are preserved (news article, Nov. 15). 
 Is our memory so short that we forget that domestic and international institutions did not fail during the lengthy, vitriolic and highly partisan impeachment process that threatened the loss of a president? And here he is still today, enjoying considerable popularity and maintaining a steady hand on the national rudder.
This time, we will gain a president. Both candidates are highly motivated to take office and to do a good job at leading the country for the next four years. We should keep moving forward until the voters in Florida, through their right to seek adjudication of their grievances, tell us it's time to stop.

UPSTATE JOB GROWTH LAGS

BYLINE: By Leslie Eaton

 BODY:
The number of new jobs in New York State has surged in the last 12 months, but the growth has been concentrated in New York City and its suburbs, according to figures released yesterday by the State Department of Labor. Across the state, the job count rose by more than 169,000, or 2 percent, which is faster than the national average of 1.8 percent. But almost 131,000 of those new jobs were downstate, where the job count soared by 2.4 percent. Upstate, the number of jobs grew by just 1.2 percent. Across the state, however, the unemployment rate continued to drop, and is far lower upstate -- 3.8 percent -- than in New York City, where it is 5.4 percent, adjusted for seasonal factors. The national average is 3.9 percent. Leslie Eaton (NYT)

HEADLINE: CLINTON IN HANOI, INTENT ON FORGING NEW RELATIONSHIP

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: HANOI, Vietnam, Friday, Nov. 17

 BODY:
More than a quarter-century after a war that cost 58,000 American lives and shaped the politics of his generation, President Clinton arrived here late Thursday promising a new relationship with Vietnam, a country that is at once fascinated by its former enemy and deeply ambivalent about opening its society and economy to a world that America dominates.
As he stepped into the cool night air, Mr. Clinton became the first president to set foot in Vietnam since Richard M. Nixon made an unscheduled six-hour visit to American troops outside Saigon in 1969, and the only one to visit Hanoi. The headquarters of the North Vietnamese command here was the target of countless American bombing sorties. 
 Mr. Clinton opposed the war as a young man, and did not serve in the military. But on this trip he plans to focus resolutely on the future. He has made Vietnam a test case of his proposition that deepening commercial ties create a powerful gravitational pull that can draw former enemies, even hard-line Communist governments, into gradual alignment with the West.
But it is still far from clear if that experiment will work here.
On Thursday night, Air Force One lazily descended through the same skies where B-52's once flew, coming in low over rice paddies that were dotted then with bomb craters and now bear billboards advertising Korean-made cars and electronics.
A motorcade sped the president over the Red River into one of Asia's most gracious capitals, where people began to line the streets in groups of a dozen or so, almost none of them old enough to remember the war.
The crowd had grown to thousands when, just before midnight, Mr. Clinton's limousine with its District of Columbia license plates drove by on the way to his hotel, a mile or so from the simple house where Ho Chi Minh and his generals prosecuted the war.
But that carefully preserved site, one of the city's most visited attractions, and the mausoleum nearby where Ho's body is on display, have been omitted from the president's three-day itinerary.
So have most other reminders of the past. Save for a trip Saturday morning to a site where investigators believe they have just found the remains of an American pilot whose plane crashed outside the city 35 years ago -- one of 1,499 Americans still unaccounted for in Vietnam -- Mr. Clinton will not be looking back at the war, the White House has said.
This morning, Mr. Clinton's route wound through the main streets of Hanoi, where thousands of young people, including many small children, stood on the sidewalks to wave in greeting.
His car crossed the central square and through the gate of the presidential palace, an imposing, mustard-colored French colonial building that once was home to the French governor general.
As he stood on a reviewing stand, the sounds of "The Star-Spangled Banner" wafted into the square.
Mr. Clinton then stepped into a large ceremonial room on the first floor of the palace for his meeting with President Tran Duc Luong, where he thanked him for the greeting that the Clintons had received.
"I've been struck by the friendliness of the people on the street, last night and this morning," Mr. Clinton said. "It is a very good omen for our relationship."
When they were joined briefly by Hillary Rodham Clinton, who had arrived here earlier Thursday, President Tran congratulated her on her election to the Senate. "We are all very happy," Mr. Tran said.
The two men then disappeared into an anteroom for an hour of talks before Mr. Clinton's planned visit to the ancient Temple of Literature. In addition to Hanoi, Mr. Clinton was to visit Ho Chi Minh City, the former Saigon, before leaving the country on Sunday.
What little Mr. Clinton has said on this trip suggests that his time as president -- and the decisions he has had to make about military interventions -- has led him to think differently about the hard choices, from bombing the north to expanding the American military presence here, that Lyndon B. Johnson made.
"I see now how hard it was for him," Mr. Clinton said on his trip across the Pacific to Brunei, Malaysia, his first stop. "I believe he did what he thought was right under the circumstances," Mr. Clinton said in speaking of Johnson. "One of the things that I have learned, too, is when you decide to employ force, there will always be unintended consequences."
Asked if America owed Vietnam an apology, though, he quickly said, "No, I don't," and left it at that.
Instead, he wants to focus on Vietnam's economic and political potential. During an economic summit meeting in Brunei, Mr. Clinton noted that this year, for the first time, Vietnam is presiding over the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean, "which means it is heading an organization that was invented to contain it."
The president was preceded here by his wife, Senator-elect Clinton, who went shopping on one of Hanoi's main streets and drew a crowd of hundreds of curious people. Today Mrs. Clinton is scheduled to visit a village outside Hanoi.
Mr. Clinton will spend a considerable part of the visit celebrating the results of his seven-year-long effort to draw Vietnam out of its self-imposed economic isolation, and his bet that both Vietnam and China will discover that prosperity in the information age necessitates a measure of political openness and the free flow of information.
In fact, Mr. Clinton and the American ambassador here, Pete Peterson, a former prisoner of war in the what came to be known sarcastically as the Hanoi Hilton (now mostly demolished), argue that personal freedoms have improved since the administration made its overtures to the country in 1994.
That year Mr. Clinton lifted the trade embargo that had been in place since the fall of Saigon 25 years ago. With the support of former P.O.W.'s in Congress, including Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican, he offered diplomatic recognition to Vietnam in 1995.
He dispatched his Secretary of State at the time, Warren Christopher, to lay the groundwork for a new relationship, and Mr. Christopher warned that economic reform was akin to "a passage over a ravine."
"You cannot do it by taking several little steps," Mr. Christopher said. "Only one giant leap will get you across."
The Vietnamese ignored him. It took five years to negotiate a comprehensive trade agreement that promises -- but hardly guarantees -- far more vigorous economic ties with the United States.
But in the interim many foreign companies that poured in here in the early 1990's have pulled up stakes in frustration. Mr. Peterson argues that American executives overstate the difficulties of dealing with Vietnamese bureaucracy and corruption, but he acknowledged the other day that Mr. Clinton would "see a country that is 8 years old, not 4,000."
Now Mr. Clinton arrives in the midst of a fierce division within the Vietnamese government over whether the prospect of reversing a huge decline in foreign investment by opening up the country is worth the threat to the Communists' rule.
In an echo of the debate under way in China, Vietnam's top Communist leader, Le Kha Phieu, warned in February that the battle with the West continued, on battlefields that bear little resemblance to lush fields of Hue or the rocky harbor at Haiphong.
"They continue to seek ways to completely wipe out the remaining socialist countries and attack the movements for independence, democracy and social progress," he said. "We should never relax our vigilance for a minute."
So it is Mr. Clinton's challenge over the next three days to accomplish what Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon could not achieve: to win the hearts and minds of the Vietnamese people.

HEADLINE: ART GUIDE

 BODY:

A selective listing by critics of The New York Times of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free.
*denotes a highly recommended show.
 
Museums 

"AMAZONS OF THE AVANT-GARDE," Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)423-3500 (through Jan. 7). A concise exercise, monographically arranged, this show focuses on six Russian women who painted around the time of the revolution. Several continued to work much later and do more than paint, but this is a tendentious affair, plausibly so. If just a couple of the women, Natalia Goncharova and Liubov Popova, were truly great painters, the exhibition still isn't a case of special pleading. The Russian avant-garde wouldn't have been what it was without them collectively. The story as it unfolds here seems, if anything, more remarkable, not less, for having as little to do with sex as it does and almost everything to do with painting. Many of the works have a surprising fortitude. Revolution. A brave new art world. The dream persists even though the form it takes keeps changing. Hours: Sundays through Wednesdays, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m; Fridays and Saturdays, 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $12; $8 for students and the elderly (Michael Kimmelman).
 
"EGYPTIAN ART AT ETON COLLEGE: SELECTIONS FROM THE MYERS MUSEUM," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth avenue at 82nd Street, (212)535-7710 (through Jan. 21). Many of the stunning objects here are no bigger than a man's hand, and some are as small as a fingernail. They are almost all from the collection of Maj. William Joseph Myers (1858-99), an alumnus of Eton College who was an avid acquirer of things Egyptian and bequeathed the objects to his almna mater. Including some 150 objects from the pre-dynastic to the Roman period - wooden figures, amulets, jewelry, vessels, mummy ornaments and cosmetic contrainers - the show is particularly rich in those made of blue-green faience, a much-used ceramic material whose base was ground quartz. One of the tiniest and most beguiling exhibits is a faience hedgehog that served as an amulet, presumably for the animal's supposed resistance to poison. Hours; Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $10; $5 for students 12 and older and the elderly (Grace Glueck).
 
* "THE EMBODIED IMAGE: CHINESE CALLIGRAPHY FROM THE JOHN B. ELLIOTT COLLECTION," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth avenue at 82nd Street, (212)535-7710 (through Jan. 7). In China the written word has traditionally been the highest art form and a source of political and emotional power. To see that power in action, check out this grandly scaled exhibition, which brings together two superb calligraphy collections - from Princeton University and the Met - in the most comprehensive survey yet seen in these parts. The dozens of scrolls covered with handwritten words collectively radiate a kind of conversational buz and suggest a richly varied cast of personalities: fastidious court functionaries, impulsive social agitators, unworldly monks, visionary poets. Together they offer an ice-breaking introduction to an art that to anyone who doesn't know Chinese can seem unapproachable. Hours and admission: See above (Holland Cotter).
 
LEE KRASNER, Broklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718)638-5000 (through Jan. 7). Despite its restless energy and moments of formal power and elegance, Lee Krasner's career int his economical retrospective looks more like one of tantalizing frustration than real fulfillment. In the 1950's and early 60's, Krasner painted splattery, ambitious Abstract Expressionist works, but they look indebted to other artists, Pollock and de Kooning mainly. Where she looks most herself is in collage; a set of large collages on canvas from the early 50's have raw density or explosive buoyancy. Collages made in the 1970's using 40-year-old charcoal drawings have a beautiful Cubistic elegance; they are the best works of her career. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m (until 11 p.m. on the first Saturday of each month); Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $4; $2 for students and the elderly (Ken Johnson).
 
*"POWER AND DESIRE: SOUTH ASIAN PAINTINGS FROM THE SAN DIEGO MUSEUM OF ART, EDWIN BINNEY 3RD COLLECTION," Asia Society at Midtown, 502 Park Avenue, at 59th Street, (212)517-2742 (through Jan. 7). The album-size paintings known as Indian miniatures, produced for an elite clientele who demanded the finest workmanship, are rightly renowned for their suave forms and brilliant colors. They also embody the moral values, political ambitions and personal aspirations of the culture that produced them. All of these ingredients come into play in this show of 67 top-of-the-line examples from the 16th to the 19th centuries. They add up to a kind of grand but intimate theater, equal parts farce, melodrama and mystery play, where men strut like gods, gods have the failings of men, and nature is a gorgeous curtain behind which infinity lies. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, noon to 5 p.m Admission: $4; $2 for students and the elderly (Cotter).
 
"RAVE REVIEWS: AMERICAN ART AND ITS CRITICS, 1826-1925," National Academy of Design Museum, 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)369-4880 (through Dec. 31). A year after the Academy opened as a school for art instruction it organized its first annual show, 170 contemporary portraits, landscapes and historical sagas. This entertaining hodge-podge of a show, described as "the first comprehensive historical examination of American art criticism," brings together more than 70 paintings and sculptures that first appeared in these shows, with the reviews they got at the time. One immediate and large success was Winslow Homer's "Prisoners From the Front" (1866), which portrayed a lineup of scraggly Confederate soldiers with their leader confronting a smartly uniformed young Union officer. The contrast made by Homer between the two sides was seen, by the painting's most perceptive reviewers, as a comment on why the South lost the Civil War. Hours: Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m Admission: $5 (Glueck).
 
* BRIDGET RILEY, "Reconnaissance," Dia Center for the arts, 548 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)989-5566 (through June 17). Once overly identified with Op Art, this British abstract painter never got her due in anti-Op New York, but a beautifully installed show of 40 paintings from 1961 to 1984 should change things. Concentrating on the early black-and-white paintings that made Ms. Riley famous, it presents stringently pure yet accessible works that have, at their best, extended the optical potential implicit in the work of Mondrian, Josef Albers and Ad Reinhardt. At their weakest, their meticulously calibrated patterns can be so aggressive that they virtually kidnap the eye, take it on a joy ride and leave it in a crumpled heap. Either way, the overall effect is of an artist of unusual dedication who has remained loyal to the original premises of her art and yet stead-fastly refused to repeat herself. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $6; $3, students and the elderly (Roberta Smith).
 
"ROBOTS AND SPACE TOYS," the Robert Lesser Collection, Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718)638-5000 (through Jan. 28). Connoisseurs of kitsch and youngsters of all ages should get a kick out of this exhibition of more that 200 toy robots, as well as rocket ships, flying saucers, astronauts and space stations, most produced by Japanese manufacturers after World War II. It includes the first toy robot, a little yellow machine-man made in the later 1930's; dozens of boxy figures from the 1950's with names like Mr. Atomic or Radicom, and many versions of Robbie the Robot from the movie "The Forbidden Planet." These mechanical homunculi are amusing but scary: could they be symbols of modernity's Faustian exchange of soul for power? Hours and admission: See above (Johnson).
 
* SANTIAGO-HOGE: "THE DEAD HAVE ARRIVED," El Museo del Barrio, Fifth Avenue at 104th Street, (212)831-7272 (through Dec. 3). This wonderful, room-filling installation by the artist team that calls itself Santiago-Hoge was commissioned by the museum in observance of the Mexican religious holiday known as the Day of the Dead. Five separate altars are banked by marigolds and incorporate a staggering wealth of materials - candies, toys, photographs, dolls, holy pictures, liquor bottles, fruit, even a video of a skeleton dancing to a Tito Puente beat - for the entertainment of day-tripping spirits and museum visitors alike. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission: $4; $2, students and the elderly (Cotter).
 
* SCYTHIAN GOLD. "The Golden Deer of Eurasia: Scythian and Sarmatian Treasures From the Russian Steppes," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212)535-7710 (through Feb. 4). "God of the Nomads: Scythian Treasures From Ancient Ukraine," Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718)638-5000 (through Jan. 21). Certain kinds of art are box-office gold. Art made of gold is one of them, and there's a Fort Knox-size supply of the precious stuff in these two opulent exhibitions. The Brooklyn show is a survey-style glimpse at some exquisitely wrought 14-carat objects drawn from museums in Ukraine, where the Scythians put down roots in the first millennium B.C. The Met has drop-dead museological rarities from the State Hermitage Museum, but the focus here, which gives the proceedings a kind of treasure-hunt thrill, is on a cache of objects excavated fairly recently from tombs belonging to non-Scythian people whose identity is something of a mystery. Ideally, the two shows should be seen together: they offer a really substantial archaeological update on the last big Scythian showcase in these parts, the Mt's smash-hot "In the Land of the Scythians" of 25 years ago. Hours and admission: See above (Cotter).
 
*EDWARD STEICHEN, Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212)570-3676 (through Feb. 4). A big, thorough exhibition, maybe a little too big and glossy, of one of the great photographers in American history, a restless, benign, flawed genius. Steichen also painted, made films, designed textiles, organied aerial reconnaissance photography in two world wars and put together the most popular photography exhibition ever, "The Family of Man." We'll see how people respond to someone whose eclectic work can look, if anything, almost too elegant and self-regarding. Steichen ultimately seemed to reduce everything and everyone to props to demonstrate his own refined and stage-savvy sensibility. But what refinement. His best work has a finesse that borders on the erotic. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays and Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $10; $8 for students and the elderly (Kimmelman).
 
* "UNTITLED PASSAGES BY HENRI MICHAUX," Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212)219-2166 (through Dec. 20). The books of the Belgian-born French poet and writer Henri Michaux are not exactly unknown on these shores, but his considerable achievement as a visual artist - a self-taught one - has yet to gain a solid foothold. This exhibition of more than 100 works on paper should change things. Spanning the late 1920's to the late 1970's, it includes examples of his finely textured "mescaline" drawings, his raucous inkscapes and his animated, often preening calligraphies. It reveals an artist profoundly influenced by Asian art who assiduously mined the fault line between language and sign, text and drawing, image and abstraction, manifesting the flow of human thought and energy in different, often hypnotic ways. Hours; Tuesdays through Saturdays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Free. A related show, "Henri Michaux: Works on Paper," is at Michael Werner, 4 East 77th Street, (212)988-1623, through Nov. 25 (Smith).
 
'THE YEAR ONE: ART OF THE ANCIENT WORLD EAST AND WEST," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212)879-5500 (through Jan. 14). The Met puts the millennial-marking art exhibition in a new perspective with a show that only an institution of its stature and girth could pull off. Drawn from seven departments, it revisits the beginning of the "modern era" around the time of the birth of Jesus with 150 sometimes tiny artworks that sample the nearly two dozen cultures flourishing at the beginning of the first millennium. The array stretches from imperial Rome to Han dynasty China, with many stops in between. High points include bronzes from Thailand and Indonesia, A Chinese mortuary pillar and a stunning re-creation of the frescoed bedroom of a Roman villa. The display is supposed to reflect the beginning of a new world consciousness brought on by expanding empires and trade, a thesis more complex than the actual objects can sustain. But no matter, most of them are considered masterpieces, all are beautifully installed and the opportunities for cross-cultural visual comparisons are rich. Hours and admission: See above (Smith).
 
Galleries: Uptown
 
BALTHUS, "Drawings From the Collection of Stanislas Klossowski de Rola," Dickinson Roundell, 19 East 66th Street, (212)772-8083 (through Nov. 22). Among 42 works on paper belonging to the artist's son are some fine portraits, like the image of a sultry-looking girl in a green-and-red pullover said to be Balthus's only surviving pastel. Most, however, including landscapes and nude studies, are disappointingly sketchy and, even if related to famous paintings, are missing Balthus's distinctive air of erotic suspense. Also on display is a copy of the book "Mitsou," which the precocious artist illustrated at age 11, and a charming small painting of a fully clothed girl from 1932 (Johnson).
 
CARL CHENG, "Nature Observed/Art Tool 2000," Sculpture Center, 167 East 69th Street, (212)879-3500 (through Dec. 16). The long-overdue New York debut of this California artist has as its centerpiece an extraterrestrial landscape made entirely of sand and spread out across the gallery floor. Its topographic features - hills, canals and cryptic pictograph patterns - were shaped by a computer-driven metal cylinder that resembles a player-piano roll but is as sensitive to the touch as a drafting pencil. Mr. Cheng has been inventing such art tools" for more than 30 years, and he is definitely on to something worth knowing a lot more about (Cotter).
 
ABELARDO MORELL, "The Universe Next Door," Bonni Benrubi, 52 East 76th Street, (212)517-3766 (through Dec. 2). For his best-known works, many of which are included here, this photographic magician turns whole rooms into cameras obscuras and then photographs the results, creating cityscapes layered over the walls and furnishings of apartment or hotel interiors. He can also transform a stack of old dictionaries or a single pencil casting a wide shadow into something of mysyteriously monumental import (Johnson).
 
'THE PUPILS OF ANNE MARIE EVANS," Ursus Books and Prints, 981 Madison Avenue, (212)772-8787 (through Nov. 30). Nature scrutinized is the theme of this attractive little exhibition of watercolor botanical studies from England that demonstrate how individual style can warm exacting scientific objectivity. A peppermint-stripe rose conjures visions of beach cabanas in a wind. Venturing into Impressionist terrain, little nosegay of spring flowers seems to tremble around the edges with delight (Cotter).
 
Galleries: 57th Street
 
LESLEY DILL, George Adams Gallery, 41 West 57th Street, (212)644-5665 (through Nov. 25). Words and their relationship with the body - physical, emotional and spiritual - are the subjects of Lesley Dill's explorations in sculpture and works on paper. The best things here are two small, wraithlike personages of white cast paper, one titled "We Live in Smoke," after a poem by Hank Hine. The figure sits crumpled on a stool, the words of poem ("We live in smoke/the words no sooner out/than we are lost to them") tumbling across its head, shoulders and chest. Ms. Dill's own pet word, "radiance," appears often in these works. Her work can be haunting, but sometimes its preciousness palls (Glueck).
 
* DONALD JUDD, "Lake Work," Pace Wildenstein, 32 East 57th Street, (212)421-3292 (through Nov. 25); "Stacks," Luhring Augustine, 531 West 24th Street, (212)206-9100 (through Dec. 2). At Luhring Augustine, four of the great Minimalist's stacks of sumptuous boxes, one per wall, create a still, chapelesque ambience. In Pace Wildenstein's busier show of late works, we see Judd working within strict limitations yet constantly discovering new, urgently felt nuances of scale, rectilinear composition and material - from breadbox-scale stacks of warmly rusted Corten steel and colorful plexiglass to an industrial-strength quintet of open five-foot aluminum cubes (Johnson).
 
* BILL VIOLA, James Cohan, 41 West 57th Street, (212)755-7171 (through Nov. 25). "Ascension," Mr. Viola's breathtaking new video projection, is unabashedly soulful and powerfully sensational, a 10-minute essay on death, beauty and resurrection. A man plunges explosively into water, hovers like a crucified Christ and sinks slowly out of view. In the front gallery is a riveting set of super-slowmotion video portraits, in which professional actors emote at glacial speeds (Johnson).
 
Galleries: Chelsea
 
SEONG CHUN AND DARO MONTAG, Caren Golden, 526 West Street, (212)727-8304 (through Nov. 25). Ms. Chun crochets thin strips of paper imprinted with writings by Mondrian into gridded compositions that look like deconstructed and slyly domesticated Mondrian paintings. Mr. Montag, a British photographer who does not use a camera, leaves pieces of organize matter - kiwi slices in the works here - on color negatives for time. In the large prints made from these chemically altered negatives, haloed, radiating images in toxic colors glowe out of deep black backgrounds. (Johnson).
 
R. CRUMB, "Restaurant Placemat Drawings," Paul Morris Gallery, 465 West 23rd Street, Chelsea, (212)277-2752 (through Dec. 9). All the drawings are from the last 10 years and were done, doodle-style, while Mr. Crumb waited for his meal. If the veteran Comix-meister makes no big advances here, that's O.K. His draftsmanly style and thematic obsessions are classics by now (Cotter).
 
SAM EASTERSON, Rare, 435 West 14th Street, (212)645-5591 (through Nov. 25). Mr. Easterson went to the desert and attached small video cameras to live animals and plants - an armadillo, a tarantula, a cactus - to capture nonhuman points of view. The uneventful tapes are shown on monitors suspended over camera -equipped, stuffed animals surrounded by colored electrical cords arranged in topographical map patterns. Mr. Easterson is apparently serious, but his project looks like something made up by Monty Python (Johnson).
 
ARTURO HERRERA, Brent Sikkema, 530 West 22nd Street, (212)929-2262 (through Nov. 25). This delightfully versatile and imaginative artist presents as expansive, tangled forest-scape cut from a single 20-foot length of black felt; a large, cut, layered and painted paper collage that has the decorative elegance of Matisse and the funky buoyancy of Elizabeth Murray; small dense paintings made of solid plastic shaped like cartoon fragments; and, on the floor, asky-colored geometric object made of corrugated cardboard called "Hurry Home, Blue" (Johnson).
 
DAMIEN HIRST, Gagosian Gallery, 555 West 24th Street, (212)741-1111 (through Dec. 16). Welcome to the Damien Hirst Universe. It's a big shiny place with mathematical grid paper printed on the walls, pale pristine dot paintings and mahy large vitrine sculptures, including two outfitted as gynecological examining rooms and filled with water and fish. It shows the artist moving beyond the dead animals and putrefying flesh that catapulted him to fame while clarifying and enriching the grandiose themes of his art: life and death and their complex, sometimes oppressive relationship to science and commerce. It contains some undeniable duds, but if it doesn't win over those who have resisted the work of this notorious young British artist, it won't be for lack of trying (Smith).
 
ALLAN McCOLLUM, "The Event: Petrified Lightning From Centra Florida," Friedrich Petzel, 535 West 22nd Street, (212)680-9467 (through Nov. 24). The fulgurite, a piece of heat-fused sand caused by lightning hitting the ground, is the subject of Mr. McCollum's perplexing installation. In one room are 10,000 replicas of a fulgurite, while stacks of booklets about fulgurites and related subjects occupy another. Fulgurites are not very sexy, so while the installation arouses curiosity, it does not crystallie modern experience as pointedly as this artist's best work has done (Johnson).
 
BJARNE MELGAARD, "The Mutilation of the Apes," Alleged Galleries, 809 Washington Street, Chelsea, (646)486-1110 (through Dec. 2). Mr. Melgaard, 33, is one of the Europe's current crop of bad-boy artists and his multi-media American debut show is raw, raunchy and adamantly content-intensive, with references to child pornography, race wars and a pantheon of heroes calculated to push a whole keyboard of hot buttons. It ain't a pretty picture, but its Goth-anarchist messiness looks right at home in one of Chelsea's liveliest galleries (Cotter).
 
Galleries: SoHo
 
LYDIA DONA, Von Lintel & Nusser, 555 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212)242-0599 (through Nove. 25). Ms. Dona brings together the sensuous and the mechanical to dissonant effect in acridly hued, Neo-Cubist paintings in which schematic images of engines and straight-edge spatial divisions are layered with gaseouscolor fields and accented by passages of thick, gloppy paint or pointillist texture (Johnson).
 
"FROM INSIDE THE BODY: CHINESE NEW PHOTOGRAPHY AND VIDEO," he Cultural Foundation, 555 Broadway, near Prince Street, SoHo. (212)925-1649 (through Jan. 6). Most of the 11 participants in this show are appearing for the first time in the United States, and together they give some idea of ways in which many young Chinese artists, with access to international art magazines, museum catalogs ad the Internet, are tailoring global styles to culturally specific ends. Some cook up contemporary riffs on traditional genres; others dive straight into a hallucinatory present, with themes that sometimes dovetail with those in recent work by artists in New York (Cotter).
 
ORIT RAFF, PETRUS SCHAESBERG, Baumgartner, 418 West 15th Street, Chelsea, (212)633-2276, (through Nov. 29). Two artists who create large, glossy color photographs, one Romantic, the other ironic. Mr. Schaesberg produces landscapes or still lifes, some arranged in grids, some with sophomoric, aphoristic texts added, that exude dry, philosophical moods. Ms. Raff's pictures of refrigerator freezer compartments desperately in need of defrosting combine impression of arctic desolation and domestic banaltiy to wry effect (Johnson).
 
ANTHONY JOSEPH SALVATORE, Cavin-Morris, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo, (212)226-3768 (through Nov. 25). The self-taught Salvatore (1938-1994) used oil sticks to make boldly patterned, juicily colored, brusquely textured pictures that hover between abstraction and visionary, biblical narration. They are well complemented by a set of Chinese scholar stones: natural, unusually formed rocks mounted on beautifully carved wooden bases. Vibrant evangelism meets Zen contemplation (Johnson).
 
JANE SCHNEIDER, June Kelly, 591 Broadway, near Houston Street, (212)226-1660, SoHo, (through Nov. 29). Working with fallen trees or logs found in upstate New York woods, Ms. Schneider assembles, carves textures and subtly paints gnarly, partily surrealistic, party expressionistic abstractions. They look raw at first, but on closer examination you see they have been worked with skilled and imaginative sensitivity (Johnson).
 
Other Galleries
 
ERIK PARKER, Leo Koenig, 359 Broadway, near Franklin Street, TriBeCa, (212)334-9255 (through Dec. 2). Mr. Parker is a kind of self-appointed archivist of postwar New York art and culture, and the paintings and drawings in this sparky first gallery show are made up mostly of words: elaborate litanies of names of people, places and movements, familiar and half-forgotten, that together evoke an era or specific scene. Each name is enclosed in a thought balloon, and these link up into pulsating cells of verbal energy framed by sinewy ornamental patterns that often spill off the canvas and across the wall (Cotter).
 
Last Chance
 
JEAN ARP, "Line and Form," Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 1018 Madison Avenue, at 78thStreet, (212)744-7400 (through tomorrow). Arp's art still looks fresh, sweet and humorously subversive, adn it is well served by this 32-piece retrospective of drawings, paintings, reliefs and sculptures. Arp's two-dimensional works, like "Profile," an amoebic yellow head or puddle, are marvels of enigmatically suggestive economy. The smooth marble "Dream Flower With Lips," which looks like a female torso or an inverted cartoon leg, marries Grecian classicism and a wacky, polymorphous eroticism (Johnson).
 
JASON RHOADES, David Zwirner, 43 Greene Street, (212)966-9074, SoHo (through tomorrow). In one room of Mr. Rhoades's latest essay in sculptural extravagance stands a sort of giant Tinkertoy sawmill - Sutter's Mill, birthplace of the California gold rush - made of polished aluminum pipes and clamps. In another room is an identical but incomplete version. During the exhibition, an assistant will always be building or dismantling one or the other mill, acting out a Sisyphean loop of construction and deconstruction (Johnson).
 
W. EUGENE SMITH, Alan Klotz, 22 East 72nd Street, (212)327-2211 (through tomorrow). This is a fine small survey of images by the great photojournalist, who worked for Life and many other magazines and died in 1978. Smith's prints have a velvety richness and an unabashedly romantic humanity. The show includes war pictures shot in Japan, like the amazing "Soldier Finding a Baby;" near-visionary views of steelmaking in Pittsburgh; images from his famous series "The Country Doctor"; and portraits of the jazz great Thelonious Monk (Johnson).
 
* SARAH SZE, Marianne Boesky Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)680-9889 (through tomorrow). Ms. Sze, 31, came on the scene in the late 1990's and quickly gained international attention for her sculptural installations made of many tiny objects - screws, matches, toothpicks - grouped in patterns that suggested computer boards and Job Lot store displays. The seven pieces in her belated New York gallery solo debut are more organic and dramatic: they look like midair explosions with fragments of furniture zooming off into space, boring into walls, breaking into splinters, with everything held together by a network of clips, cables and bentwood strips. Coming from a virtuoso of improvised accumulation, the results may seem a little too "done," but they're still pretty astonishing (Cotter).
 
"TRES COMPLEMENTAIRES," Mary Ryan Gallery, 24 West 57th Street, (212)397-0669 (through Wednesday). Time has dimmed the success story of two American artists, Maud Hunt Squire (1873-1954) and Ethel Mars (1876-1959), who expatriated themselves to France in 1906 and spent the rest of their lives there (except during World War I). This show, mounted in cooperation with the Susan Sheehan Gallery, is an attempt to re-establish their work, best represented by their early prints: Squire's color etchings and Mars's color woodblocks. After the war the two moved to the south of France, where they concentrated on drawing and painting, producing slight but charming scenes of beach and village life. But the early prints stand out (Glueck).

HEADLINE: Housing Starts Continued To Edge Up In October

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 17

 BODY:
Housing construction moderated last month as builders broke ground on more apartments than single-family homes, the latest evidence that the nation's economy is slowing.
Housing starts inched up to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.53 million in October, a 0.1 percent increase from September, the Commerce Department said today. 
 Even with the small advance, housing construction, which declined each month from May through August, remained at a solid level, analysts said.
"It's not the fantastic market we saw one year or one and a half years ago," said Stanley Duobinis, director for forecasting at the National Association of Home Builders.
"Traffic is a little reduced, sales are not coming as quickly and as easily, and builders are telling us the marketplace is cooling," he said. "But nobody is telling us the market is really dropping like a rock."
The latest housing report was weaker than many analysts expected. They had estimated that September's strong 0.7 percent increase would be matched in October.
Still, said Joel L. Naroff, an economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pa., "not too many builders will be crying too loudly; they are still digging those holes."
Fixed-rate 30-year mortgages averaged 7.8 percent last month, down slightly from the average 7.9 percent in September and October 1999.
With mortgage rates holding steady below the 8 percent mark, builders say they feel good about sales.
Economists expect housing starts and home sales, which have been an engine of the robust economy, to soften this year, reflecting the toll of higher interest rates.
In October, starts of apartments, condominiums and other multifamily housing projects rose by 1.3 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 305,000, after a 3.8 percent gain in September.
Starts of single-family homes, however, fell a modest 0.2 percent in October, to a rate of 1.2 million, after holding steady the month before.

HEADLINE: CLINTON IN VIETNAM: THE PEOPLE;
Excited Welcome for Clinton, Part Celebrity, Part Hero

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS

DATELINE: HANOI, Vietnam, Nov. 17

 BODY:
It happened twice: the president of the United States, his face glowing, walked right up to Dang Dinh Hiep, grasped his hand and gave him a brilliant smile. Then he returned and did it again.
"He shook my hand and then he came and shook it again!" exclaimed Mr. Hiep, 52, a post office worker -- one of tens of thousands of people who thronged the streets today to catch a glimpse of President Clinton as he toured Hanoi. "I'm a happy man." 
Twenty-five years ago as a Communist soldier, Mr. Hiep said, he had helped capture the southern capital, Saigon, sharing in Vietnam's moment of victory over the United States. Today he had met the president and he was thrilled again.
"He's a wonderful man," cried Mr. Hiep, as if Mr. Clinton could still hear him. "Very happy and smiling. He was against the war in the past and now he is contributing to better relations between our countries."
And then, like a baseball fan brandishing a home-run ball in the stands, he held up two fistfuls of yellow police tape, something to show to his grandchildren to prove that he had been here.
Almost everywhere Mr. Clinton went today on his first full day in Vietnam -- at his hotel, at the government guest house, at the Temple of Literature, at Vietnam National University -- he was met by huge, excited crowds, waving and calling out to him.
Neither the visiting American delegation nor the Vietnamese authorities, it seems, had anticipated their numbers or their enthusiasm.
Police officers in forest-green uniforms used nightsticks and electric prods to hold back the crowds, sometimes chasing and taking a whack at someone who tried to stray too close.
"He's coming! Here he comes!" people shouted as the president's motorcade approached the Temple of Literature, a historic landmark in the center of town. "I can see him! There's his wife! How handsome he is! He seems so young and healthy, he's so pink, just the way he looks on TV, but even handsomer! I want to shake his hand! I want to give him a hug!"
Le Thi Loan, 33, who works in a tea shop, had been waiting for five hours with her 8-year-old son to see Mr. Clinton. "We really look up to him," she said. "He's a talented man, a great man."
Nguyen Tra My, 30, who works for an Austrian food-processing company, was wearing her finest clothes and most brilliant lip gloss.
"Looking at Clinton is our dream come true," she said as she waited, speaking in excellent English. "We hope that we can contact him and say some sentences to him. He is a very, very nice man and he really supports Vietnam very much. Actually, all of us, we really like him and respect him very much."
Two old veterans shared tiny cups of tea as they waited nearby.
"During the war we had a very hard time here, and after the war it was very difficult too; not even rice to eat," said one of them, Le Xuong, 79. "Life is much better now. And we are trying to erase our hatreds of the past and turn a new page in our history."
That is right, said Nguyen Trong, 70, a retired colonel who said he had served in four wars, involving France, Cambodia and China as well as the United States. "That's the way it is," he said, "close down the past. We have a saying in Vietnam: 1,000 friends are not enough, but one enemy is too many."
After about half an hour Mr. Clinton emerged from the Temple of Literature, his pale blue necktie shimmering in the bright fall sunshine.
"Hello! Hello!" people called to him in English.
And Mr. Clinton responded: he plunged into the crowd, moving from right to left and then to the right again along the sidewalk.
Nguyen Ngoc Ba, 40, an electronics repairman, was directly in the president's path.
"He just came right up and grabbed my hand," he said. "His hand was warm, maybe from shaking so many hands. It was very quick, just long enough for me to feel the warmth of his hand."
The warmth seemed to flow both ways. Mr. Clinton paused before climbing at last into his black limousine. "Look at the children," he murmured to a security agent.
The biggest crowds of the day were in the streets outside the university, where students and residents packed the sidewalks, some sitting on walls and some perching in the branches of trees for a better view.
"Vietnam-America: Close the past, open up a new horizon," read a hand-lettered sign in English held up by several young women, students at the university. "We want relations to be better and better," said one student, Do My Hien, 20.
But soon, a group of security men came up and seized the sign, folding it into a small square before marching away with it. "I don't know why they took it," said one of the young women. "Maybe they don't understand what it says."
In the Giao Duc bookstore nearby, staff members gathered with several friends by a small television set to listen as Mr. Clinton addressed the nation in a live broadcast from the university's auditorium.
Some of them said they had stayed up until almost 1 a.m. today to watch his motorcade when he drove down their street from the airport after his arrival in Vietnam.
"We didn't know the schedule so we waited for him all day," said Le Thi Tam, one of the workers at the bookstore. "Some people began waiting for him at 3 p.m."
Surrounded by shelves of textbooks -- philosophy, economics, psychology, computer science, foreign languages -- they watched now as Mr. Clinton strode to the lectern, a bust of Ho Chi Minh to one side.
"A big guy," commented Tran Quang Binh, who teaches mathematics at the university.
"He looks like Kennedy," said Chu Anh Quan, a bookstore worker, adding in English: "Very handsome."
"No, not like Kennedy," said another worker, Tran Thu Lan. "Kennedy was more stylish, more like a playboy."
They leaned forward in their chairs as Mr. Clinton began to speak, one woman embracing another from behind, their heads almost touching.
"He's explaining the war," said Mr. Binh, the mathematics teacher, at one point. "Back in the war time he was one of the antiwar protesters."
And then there was a murmur of agreement when Mr. Clinton said, "We cannot change the past. What we can change is the future."
"That's right," Mr. Binh said. "He's talking sense."
Ha Tuan Anh, the bookstore manager, offered a sobering aside: "He'll be out of a job in eight weeks," he said. "They have a law limiting them to two terms."
Which led Mr. Binh to observe: "In our system you can stay on for years and years."
There was a small silence in the room as the speech ended and the bookstore audience sat back in their chairs considering their verdict.
"Pretty good speech," Mr. Anh said.
"Very good," Mr. Binh agreed. "It's probably written by his speechwriters."

HEADLINE: Another Round of Layoffs At U.S. Firestone Factories

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: DETROIT, Nov. 17

 BODY:
Stuck with a huge inventory of Firestone tires and slow sales because of the current recall, Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. announced its second round of job cuts in a month today, saying that nearly 1,100 factory workers would be laid off for at least five months.
The layoffs were the latest sign that sales of Firestone tires have not recovered from the recall on Aug. 9 of 14.4 million Firestone ATX and Wilderness tires that were mounted mainly on Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles. Firestone estimated that 6.5 million of these tires were still in use when the recall began. The company said today that it had replaced 80 percent of these tires and that it expected to eliminate waiting lists for replacement tires by the end of the month. 
 Firestone officials said today that the recall had hurt sales but noted that they also faced other problems. The company accumulated a huge supply of unsold tires last summer in preparation for a labor strike that never happened. And the tire industry's overall sales are weakening as auto production begins to slow and as a cooling economy dampens demand for replacement tires. In response, Firestone has now laid off one-seventh of its 11,000 manufacturing workers and furloughed even more.
Firestone said today that it would reduce production on Jan. 21 at its factory in Oklahoma City, laying off 700 people, and at its factory in LaVergne, Tenn., laying off nearly 400 people. "It is our hope and expectation to be able to bring back these employees during the second half of next year as we anticipate an increase in sales and we deplete our inventories," said John T. Lampe, Firestone's chief executive.
Firestone will also stop production for two weeks, beginning on Jan. 14, at its factory in McMinnville, Tenn., and will furlough nearly 900 workers there. Laid-off and furloughed workers are eligible for unemployment benefits, with the company supplementing payments from state unemployment agencies so that workers continue to draw 80 percent of their pay excluding overtime.
Today's actions are in addition to the company's announcement on Oct. 17 that it would lay off indefinitely 450 workers at the factory in Decatur, Ill., and would close for four weeks this autumn the LaVergne and Oklahoma City factories, furloughing those workers.
Consumers, personal injury lawyers and law enforcement agencies have filed complaints with regulators about the tires, which have been cited in 119 deaths, mainly in Explorers that rolled over after the treads peeled off the tires.
Investigations into the problem have focused on whether the tires were poorly designed or poorly made and whether Ford engineers erred in designing the Explorer. But while investigators have looked mainly at decisions by white-collar engineers, the people who have lost jobs so far because of the problem have been blue-collar Firestone workers.
John Sellers, the executive vice president for rubber and plastics industries at the United Steelworkers of America, which represents unionized Firestone workers, said he was unhappy about the layoffs but understood the company's predicament. "No matter who made the mistake, they have an inventory that at this point isn't moving," he said.
In a separate development, a federal judge in Indianapolis ordered Firestone to quit destroying tires that could be used as evidence in lawsuits. Judge Sarah Evans Barker of United States District Court issued the order at the request of lawyers bringing more than 50 suits against Firestone and Ford. The personal-injury, wrongful-death and product-liability suits have been consolidated before Judge Barker for evidence-gathering. She instructed both sides to meet to work out a compromise.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Rally Fueled by Election Ruling Slips on Investor Worries

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Stocks ended slightly lower yesterday after rallying briefly on hopes that the presidential election would be decided soon and then falling as investors worried about slowing economic growth and the effect that would have on corporate earnings.
The news that set off the selling came from BellSouth, the local telephone company for the Southeast. The company, based in Atlanta, said late Thursday that its profit growth next year would shrink to 7 percent to 9 percent, well below the previous forecast of 13 percent to 15 percent. 
 Shares of BellSouth dropped $4.00, or 8.5 percent, to $43.00. Declines in financial stocks also pulled the market lower.
Fear of slowing growth for the telephone business sent the stocks of of other telephone companies and of some of their equipment providers, including semiconductor manufacturers, lower. SBC Communications fell $1.88, to $56.
But a rally among semiconductor makers and a rebound among makers of communications equipment helped reduce the losses for the day in the three main market gauges.
The Standard & Poor's index of communications equipment manufacturers ended up 1 percent, after being down as much as 2.2 percent. Losses were also trimmed by rallies in other technology stocks, including Intel, which rose $1.50, to $41.50.
At the end of the day, the Nasdaq composite index was down 4.69 points, or 0.15 percent, to 3,027.19. The S.& P. 500 dropped 4.60 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,367.72. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 26.16 points, or 0.25 percent, to 10,629.87. Since the election, the Dow is down 2.9 percent; the Nasdaq, 11.4 percent and the S.& P. 500, 4.5 percent.
In the bond market, yields rose after a Florida court ruling that was favorable to Gov. George W. Bush stirred some hope that the race would soon be decided.
In late trading, the yield on the Treasury's 10-year note had risen to 5.69 percent from 5.66 percent on Thursday. Its price, which moves in the opposite direction, slipped 7/32, to 100 13/32. The yield on the Treasury's two-year note was at 5.85 percent, up from 5.82 percent on Thursday.
Since the election, the stock market has had to wrestle with both earnings and uncertainty over who will become president. It still appeared that concern over earnings has had much more to do with the decline in stocks. But the unresolved election has provided a negative backdrop.
"What really counts right now is what is happening to the economy, to corporate earnings and what the Federal Reserve might do," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at the First Albany Corporation.
Mr. Johnson said concerns that the economy was slowing too much were probably heightened this week when Federal Reserve policy makers indicated that they were still worried about inflationary pressures.
The power of the uncertainty over the election was seen briefly yesterday in the sharp reaction when a judge issued a ruling that could pave the way for Mr. Bush to win Florida and the presidency.
Judge Terry P. Lewis of Leon County Circuit Court in Tallahassee, Fla., ruled that the secretary of state, Katherine Harris, a Republican, had properly exercised her discretion in refusing to include hand-counted votes in the total for the state. Mr. Bush had a narrow lead in Florida.
But that sudden rally, which sent the Dow up more than 100 points, or about 1 percent, and the Nasdaq up more than 70 points, or more than 2 percent, only lasted for about 20 minutes as earnings concerns overtook investors again.
Late yesterday, the Florida Supreme Court barred Ms. Harris from certifying the election results today and scheduled a hearing for Monday on Vice President Al Gore's appeal of the circuit court decision.
There was more of a reaction to the court decision in the Treasury market. Investors sold the Treasury's 10-year note and 30-year bond after Judge Lewis's decision was announced, pushing yields higher. The 10-year yield, which was at 5.68 percent at 10 a.m., jumped to 5.70 percent and stayed in that area for the rest of the day. The yield on the 30-year bond rose to 5.78 percent from 5.75 percent and settled at 5.77 percent late in the day.
Analysts say that a Bush victory will be generally good for stocks, in part because of Mr. Gore's remarks about drug and oil companies. But for the bond market, a Bush victory could mean that the current government budget surplus would eventually disappear if he succeeded in winning approval of his proposed $1.3 trillion tax cut. However, the narrow control that the Republicans hold in Congress and the possibility of lingering partisan bitterness made some analysts think that Mr. Bush would have little chance of winning approval for the entire tax cut.

HEADLINE: COUNTING THE VOTE: THE GREEN PARTY;
Nader Sees Greens Building Status as a Major Party

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 17

 BODY:
Ralph Nader, who drew 2.8 million votes 3 percent of the total -- as the Green Party's presidential candidate, contended today that the Green Party was the fastest growing in the nation and would achieve major-party status within 12 years.
Mr. Nader told reporters at a luncheon here that he had not decided whether to run again in 2004. Until that year, he said, he would concentrate on building the party and fielding Congressional candidates in 2002. 
 "We're building a party for the future," he said. "Obviously, there are a lot of open slots in the Green Party."
Mr. Nader said the Democratic Party might be able to thwart the growth of the Greens "if they face left" instead of continuing to drift to the center. Democrats will never successfully "out-Republican the Republicans," he said.
Mr. Nader also said he remained untroubled by the possibility that Gov. George W. Bush of Texas would become president because the Green Party took votes away from Vice President Al Gore. If Mr. Bush prevails, he said, his very narrow margin, the closely divided Congress and Mr. Bush's own personality will limit the damage he can do.
"He doesn't know very much," Mr. Nader said of Mr. Bush. "He is not very energetic. He doesn't like controversy."
Under either Mr. Bush or Mr. Gore, he said, the nation would face "four more years of ignoring systemic injustice." Under Mr. Gore, he said, that failure would be even less acceptable "because he knows more" but "he cowers again and again."
Mr. Nader predicted that success for the Green Party would follow greater understanding of the reality of the nation's economic situation. "Most people in this country are broke," he said.
"This is an economy that's very good for the top 10 percent," he continued. "A lot of the country is in real decay."
He said that people responded to polls by saying they were better off than they were some years ago because families held two or three jobs, and that 47 million Americans were making less than $10 an hour.
The single most important thing to do to improve the circumstances of working men and women, Mr. Nader said, is to encourage unionization. He said Congress should change the labor laws so that if a majority of workers at a factory signed up for a union, they would have one, without having to go through an election period.
Now, he said, employers can fire pro-union workers with no real cost. At worst they have to give the workers back pay minus whatever they had earned, he said, and it usually takes more than three years to make such a case before the National Labor Relations Board.
Mr. Nader complained that the news media had covered his campaign only in terms of its effect on the Gore-Bush race.
Although he raised issues, like lobbyists' dominance in Washington, that had been explored by serious newspapers, "I was not asked any questions about any of the substance," he said. "It was all the horse race."

HEADLINE: CLINTON IN VIETNAM: THE FIRST LADY;
In Northern Vietnam Countryside, a Village Takes to Hillary Clinton

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: PHU TANG, Vietnam, Nov. 17

 BODY:
While her husband drew overflow crowds and delivered a soaring speech to university students, Hillary Rodham Clinton struck a more intimate note today, going to this dusty village outside Hanoi to meet with women helped by a foreign lending program.
Mrs. Clinton has long championed small loans as a way to lift rural women and their families out of poverty. In this visit, the latest of 20 she has made from Africa to Asia, she found no shortage of testimonials. 
 Le Thi Luong, 31, a mother of two, showed Mrs. Clinton her thriving business, making tofu and raising pigs, which she built using steadily bigger loans over six years.
At Mrs. Luong put her tofu machine through its paces, Mrs. Clinton gazed at her well-kept courtyard and house, which Mrs. Luong recently expanded and crowned with an impressive railing of stone pillars.
Small children, who had clambered onto the roof, peered through the railing at Mrs. Clinton, laughing in delight when she and her daughter, Chelsea, put on conical straw hats to ward off the morning sun.
"I'm very interested in what you're doing," Mrs. Clinton said to Mrs. Luong, while stealing glances at the children.
Before leaving, Mrs. Clinton inspected a pigsty, noting that the occupants "looked like happy, contented animals." Next to the first lady, a contingent of reporters milled restlessly in their own pen.
Mrs. Clinton's visit to Vietnam is drawing heightened interest because of her election to the Senate. The first lady attracted noisy crowds when she went shopping in Hanoi on Thursday. At times today her tour seemed almost like an extension of her long campaign in New York State.
At a meeting of 160 women who take part in the loan program, Mrs. Clinton stepped before the crowd with a microphone to give what sounded like a stump speech about the role of credit in strengthening families. She also touched on education.
"For many years I have believed in the power of these small loans," Mrs. Clinton said, standing in a modest village temple as turquoise ceiling fans whirred over her head. "You are really making a better future for yourselves, your families, your villages and your country."
Mrs. Clinton took note of Vietnam's history, pointing out that women had always played a central role in the economy. Her observation seemed amplified by the absence of men throughout the day.
One man who did greet Mrs. Clinton, Trang Van Quang, said he was not bothered that the loans had increased the influence of women here. "It's good for the economy of the whole village," Mr. Quang said. "We're all working together to pull ourselves out of poverty."
The micro-credit program, financed by the private aid agency Oxfam America, has disbursed $2.1 million in loans to more than 10,000 Vietnamese women. Recipients explained to Mrs. Clinton how they repay the loans and how the money had helped them to boost their monthly income.
As the women, wearing pink shirts, sang songs about the program, Mrs. Clinton and Chelsea clapped along. Outside the temple, more women lined up three deep at every stop to catch a glimpse of the first lady.
"We very much thank Mrs. Clinton for visiting us," said Pham Thi Hoa, a neighbor of Mrs. Luong. "We think her visit shows solidarity for women."
Like most people here, Mrs. Pham said she was not aware that Mrs. Clinton had been elected to political office. In the welcome banners strung across highways and buildings, Senator-elect Clinton is referred to as "Phu Nhan," the spouse of His Excellency, President William Jefferson Clinton.
"We live in a remote village, and we only know that she is the wife of the president," Mrs. Pham said.
But while the Vietnamese government is relegating her to a supporting role, Mrs. Clinton's schedule befits a future senator. On Saturday she is scheduled to be host of a forum on issues affecting women in Vietnam. On Sunday she plans to give a speech in Ho Chi Minh City, the former Saigon.
Nor has Mrs. Clinton's status dulled her image, either here or on the streets of Hanoi. Nguyen Tra My, who works at a food processing company, said she knew all the stories about the first lady and her husband.
"That's one of the things that makes us respect her more," Ms. My said. "We see that she has a lot of character, that we can learn from her."

HEADLINE: William Woodside, Executive, Dies at 78

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
William S. Woodside, a prominent business and civic leader who used his positions as a platform to promote social change in the New York area and nationwide, died on Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 78 and also had homes in Scottsdale, Ariz., and Litchfield, Conn.
The cause was lung disease, said his wife, Migs. 
 The resume of Mr. Woodside's accomplishments is long. And for a highly successful business leader, his list of interests and causes was eclectic.
He spent the bulk of his professional career -- a span of 37 years -- at the American Can Company, a blue-chip concern he joined in 1951 as its first economist.
In 1975, he was named president and chief operating officer. Five years later, he became chairman and chief executive.
In 1980, Mr. Woodside was named chairman of the Regional Plan Association, a private nonprofit group that makes recommendations on transportation, housing and recreation for New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. He held that position until 1989.
In the 1980's, Mr. Woodside was an advocate for change in public education. Through American Can and its foundation, which he led, he supported projects on hunger and nutrition. And he was actively involved in developing ideas and plans that led to change in the landscape of the New York metropolitan area, including the reshaping of downtown Brooklyn.
"There were very few people in corporate America then or now that were prepared to stand up and express views on social policy issues," said Peter B. Goldberg, president and chief executive of the Alliance for Children and Families in Milwaukee. "The guy was absolutely courageous about expressing views many of his peers would neither share nor express."
Richard T. Anderson, president of the New York Building Congress and president of the Regional Plan from 1989 to 1992, said: "Over all, Bill represented the very best in metropolitan corporate leadership. He was of the old school, that you can't just be a corporate executive. He was very much an action guy. And he used his corporate stature to advance regional cooperation and action."
Even as he pushed for social change, Mr. Woodside orchestrated a sweeping reorganization of American Can.
Hemmed in by high interest rates and high inflation in the late 1970's, Mr. Woodside became convinced that the company's main businesses -- metal and paper packaging products -- were good but not fast-growing businesses.
The company began to change under William F. May, Mr. Woodside's predecessor. But in the spring of 1981, just months after he had assumed the top jobs at the company, Mr. Woodside startled the business world when he announced that American Can planned to sell its paper and forest products operations and move into new business ventures.
Gerald Tsai, a successful Wall Street money manager, read news of this change in corporate direction with interest.
"I contacted Bill Woodside after I read a story in The New York Times that American Can was going to sell Dixie Cup and wanted to transform the company into a service business," Mr. Tsai said. "I met with him, and he bought Associated Madison, where I was chairman."
Mr. Tsai joined American Can in April 1982. Over the next two years, the company spent more than $700 million to acquire six regional insurance companies. It later bought Smith Barney, Harris Upham, the brokerage firm.
"Bill Woodside was one of the pioneers in completely restructuring a company, turning it into a financial services company as our economy was changing," said Joseph A. Califano Jr., the former Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare who was a longtime American Can board member.
In 1986, Mr. Tsai succeeded Mr. Woodside as American Can's chairman and chief executive. Reflecting its transformation, the company subsequently changed its name to Primerica.
In December 1988, a little more than a year after the stock market crash, Primerica was sold to the Commercial Credit Corporation, controlled by Sanford A. Weill, for $1.45 billion. It is now part of Citigroup.
Mr. Woodside's first marriage ended in divorce, and after he remarried in September 1975 and moved into Manhattan, Mr. Woodside also had the opportunity to deepen his interest and appreciation of art.
The Whitney Museum of American Art quickly became one of his favorite haunts. He was appointed to the Whitney's board in 1979 and was named president in 1985, a post he held until June 1990.
Mr. Woodside's tenure at the Whitney coincided with the most turbulent period in the museum's history. Divisions over a proposed expansion and unhappiness among the curatorial staff with the leadership provided by the Whitney's director, Thomas N. Armstrong III, were contentious issues.
On March 6, 1990, the Whitney's board voted to dismiss Mr. Armstrong from the position he had held for 15 years.
"Bill Woodside provided stability and leadership during a difficult time for the museum," Joel S. Ehrenkranz, the current president of the Whitney board, said in a statement yesterday.
In addition to art and archaeology, another of Mr. Woodside's passions was public education -- and the need for business to support it.
Born in Columbus, Ohio, Mr. Woodside received his high school education at public schools in Baltimore. He then earned a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from Lehigh University, and a master's degree in economics at Harvard University, where he studied under professors like Joseph Schumpeter, Gottfried Habbler and Wasily Leontief.
"He was one of the most extraordinary corporate leaders to focus on education," said Mr. Califano, who now heads the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University. "He saw education as increasingly splitting the country between the haves and the have-nots."
Michael D. Usdan, president of the Institute for Educational Leadership in Washington, characterized Mr. Woodside as a "remarkably multifaceted man who was deeply committed to issues of equity and children's concerns, as well as education."
Mr. Woodside was a member of the institute's board from 1987 until his death, and served as chairman from 1987 to 1993.
In addition to his wife, Mr. Woodside is survived by three children, William S. Woodside III, Anne D. Gruzdowich and Samuel T. Woodside; two stepchildren, Geoffrey Dann and Deborah Dann; and six grandchildren.
Mr. Woodside credited his wife with the development of his social consciousness.
When he first met his second wife in the early 1970's, the former Migs Bernard was working for Phoenix House, the largest drug-treatment program in New York.
"Migs turned me into a real human being with real feelings and concerns about things," he once told a reporter. "Before, I was a rather typical suburbanite who came into New York and went to the theater but who never thought much about the problems of the urban poor or hunger or drug addiction."

HEADLINE: More Strategy Than Facts In Teacher Workday Row

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS

 BODY:
In one of its first salvos in the contract battle with New York City teachers, the Giuliani administration argued two days ago that the teachers spend too little time actually teaching, and bolstered the argument with statistics showing that teachers in New York work up to an hour and 45 minutes less a day than teachers in other parts of the country.
The teachers' union countered that the City Hall statistics were selective and misleading and failed to take into account that teachers are not factory workers who stop working the moment they head for home. 
 "Thank God a firefighter doesn't have to be on call after they leave," Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers, said yesterday. "Thank God a police officer, or a sanitation worker or somebody who works in an office doesn't have to be on call. The mayor and his minions just gave themselves very hefty raises and they justified that as being on call."
The dispute has crystallized a long-running debate about how much teachers actually teach and how much they should teach. Experts say the facts are more complicated than either side is admitting. And, the experts say, the facts in this case may be less important than strategy and public relations in what is likely to be a nasty and protracted labor negotiation.
For now, the attacks have put the union on the defensive as the mayor has maneuvered to create a public perception of teachers as less productive than other city workers, like police or firefighters, or even other professionals who work long hours without the long summer vacations that most teachers get.
On the other side, however, the teachers union has aggressively pushed the case that New York City teachers face tougher conditions yet earn significantly less -- as much as 25 percent less in some categories -- than their suburban counterparts.
Under the just-expired contract, New York City teachers in all grade levels are required to work 6 hours and 20 minutes a day, including 50 minutes for lunch. On Thursday, the Giuliani administration released statistics compiled by an economist at the University of Missouri showing that New York City's contractually mandated workday is shorter than the workday for teachers in eight other major cities.
The gap ranges from 31 minutes more in Chicago to 60 minutes in Los Angeles and one hour and 45 minutes in Dallas. The mayor also put out statistics showing that New York City's contractual workday was shorter than that of 16 other school districts across New York State. It is, according to City Hall, 15 minutes shorter than Rochester, half an hour shorter than Yonkers, 48 minutes shorter than Levittown on Long Island, 55 minutes shorter than Massapequa, and 65 minutes shorter than New Rochelle, the longest workday on Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's list.
In response, Ms. Weingarten asserted that, to the degree that suburban teachers do work longer hours, the time is not going into teaching in the classroom. Instead, she said, it is going toward activities like meeting the school bus, professional development, planning and office hours so that children can meet with teachers for help and advice. Indeed, she said, New York City's teachers teach the same five 40-45 minute periods a day as teachers around the country.
She said that it was unfair to look only at the amount of time teachers spend in school and not to consider less favorable working conditions, including the larger classes and shortages of supplies faced by city teachers. In the city, she said, the average class has 30 percent more students in it than in the surrounding suburbs.
Ms. Weingarten compiled State Education Department statistics for the same 16 districts across New York State that the mayor used to make his case. New York City, she said, has an average of 24 kindergartners per class compared with 20 in the other 16 districts; 27 students in first through 6th grades compared with 22; and 29 in 10th grade math compared with 24 in the other districts.
The median salary for New York City teachers, she said, is nearly $18,000 less than it is in the other 16 districts named by the mayor -- or $47,345, compared with $65,270, exclusive of benefits.
Independent studies by the federal Department of Education support the union's contention that the number of 40-to-45 minute periods teachers teach in New York City and State -- five -- is standard across the country. However, the latest statistics available from the federal government, for the 1993-94 school year, also support the mayor's contention that city teachers are required to be in school -- as opposed to teaching in a classroom -- slightly less than the national average, or 31 hours a week in New York, compared with the national average of 33 hours in public schools and 34 in private schools.
The same federal report said, however, that regardless of how many hours teachers are required to be in school, they reported spending an average of 46 hours a week doing school-related work, such as preparing lessons and grading homework.
While Mr. Giuliani is pushing for teachers to teach more, Ms. Weingarten said that more time in the classroom would be so draining as to be counterproductive. "From my perspective, the mayor is dead wrong," she said. "What you are doing is you are performing, you're engaged with -- it could be 33 or 34 kids to a class -- for five periods a day, and it is exhausting work if you're doing it well. The only thing comparable is if I was litigating in a courtroom for 180 days. No lawyer I know does that."
Even as Ms. Weingarten said she was offended by the mayor's attempt to count every minute of her members' days, Mr. Giuliani's press office faxed a copy of a newsletter from a high school union leader to a reporter yesterday. The fax, though City Hall did not comment on it, appeared to be an effort to rebut the assertions of teachers that they routinely work far more hours than their contract requires.
"Some of our administrators and supervisors, in their zealousness to look good, may attempt to pressure our members to work longer unpaid hours during Regents week," the union leader wrote in the newsletter. "Work outside the time frame must be voluntary and paid."

HEADLINE: Warm Welcome in Hanoi

 BODY:
There are times when the visit of an American president to a foreign nation produces an extraordinary show of public curiosity about the United States and the freedoms that Americans enjoy. That happened yesterday in Hanoi as tens of thousands of Vietnamese lined the streets to greet Bill Clinton, the first American president to visit Vietnam since the end of the war more than a quarter-century ago. At a moment when many Americans are wondering whether the contested election is diminishing the presidency, Mr. Clinton's appearance in Hanoi seemed to demonstrate the enduring power and symbolism of the office.
Large crowds of Vietnamese, far bigger than either Washington or Hanoi had expected, turned out to greet Mr. Clinton's motorcade as it wound through the streets of a capital that was bombed by American warplanes three decades ago. Whenever he stepped from his limousine, they gathered around him enthusiastically. Millions watched on television screens when Mr. Clinton addressed the students of Hanoi University yesterday afternoon. 
 This spontaneous outpouring was an implicit challenge to Vietnam's conservative Communist hierarchy, which believes in carefully choreographed political expression organized from the top down. Mr. Clinton politely, but explicitly, challenged their attempts to restrict information and debate. In his speech at the university, he spoke respectfully about Vietnamese history, diplomatically about the pain and sacrifices of both sides during the Vietnam War and positively about the promise of globalization.
But he plainly told his audience that "Americans believe the freedom to explore, to travel, to think, to speak, to shape decisions that affect our lives enrich the lives of individuals and nations." Mr. Clinton also discussed human rights issues at his meetings with Vietnamese officials, to their evident discomfort.
Vietnam's most powerful leader is the head of its Communist Party, Le Kha Phieu. In recent years he has slowed down efforts to open Vietnam's economy and silenced party veterans who dared call for greater political freedom. The results have been costly in lost foreign investment and growing public disillusionment. In response to these pressures, Vietnam recently agreed to a new free-trade agreement with the United States. But there has been no corresponding movement toward political liberalization.
The freedom to shape decisions that Mr. Clinton talked about remains the exclusive preserve of top Communist leaders. When those leaders gather for their national party congress next year, they should ponder Mr. Clinton's message and the enthusiasm shown by the people of Hanoi for the political freedom he extolled.

HEADLINE: CLINTON IN VIETNAM: THE OVERVIEW;
Huge Crowd in Hanoi for Clinton, Who Speaks of 'Shared Suffering'

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: HANOI, Vietnam, Nov. 17

 BODY:
Tens of thousands of Vietnamese, many of them former soldiers who once battled the United States, poured into the streets of Hanoi today to welcome President Clinton, waving to his motorcade and watching on television as he told the nation that "shared suffering has given our countries a relationship unlike any other."
Speaking at the Vietnam National University, a bust of Ho Chi Minh just behind him, Mr. Clinton repeatedly went out of his way to honor soldiers on both sides of "the conflict we call the Vietnam War and you call the American War," equating their sacrifices, but never delving into the causes they represented. 
 Instead, he gave his Vietnamese audience -- no one knows how many of the country's 78 million people were watching -- a description of the Vietnam memorial on the Mall in Washington, where the names of the American dead are etched in black stone. "Some American veterans also refer to the 'other side of the wall,' the staggering sacrifice of the Vietnamese people on both sides of that conflict -- more than three million brave soldiers and civilians," Mr. Clinton said.
The president and his huge entourage of officials, members of Congress and business executives were clearly taken by surprise at the warmth of the reception he got on this city's chaotic streets. The size and enthusiasm of the crowds was particularly striking because Vietnam's leaders treated the president with polite but distant formality, as if they were still unsure about how far they wanted to take this new opening with a former enemy.
One senior administration official here said tonight that he sensed that the Vietnamese leaders "were a little bit nervous about what they were seeing on the streets."
But if Vietnam's president and prime minister were cautious about their visitor, Mr. Clinton was equally careful about how he spoke of the war's legacy and Vietnam's record of repressing dissidents. His comments equating the struggles of American and Vietnamese forces made for the kind of speech that it would be hard to imagine any president giving if he had to face re-election -- especially a president who opposed the war and actively maneuvered to avoid the draft. But he seemed ebullient about his reception today, and liberated by the fact that he is leaving office in eight weeks and three days.
Asked why the president had made no moral judgments about America's failed effort to save South Vietnam or about the North's ultimately successful drive to unify the country under Communist leadership, Mr. Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, said the president wanted to focus on the future.
"The national interest now is not served by re-arguing the debates surrounding the war," he said.
At a toast at a state dinner tonight, Mr. Clinton said: "The history we leave behind is painful and hard. We must not forget it but we must not be controlled by it."
The president similarly stepped extremely carefully when he raised Vietnam's suppression of dissent and its limits on emigration. While clearly calling for more openness, Mr. Clinton said in his speech that "we do not seek to impose these ideals, nor could we." That was a far cry from his challenge to Jiang Zemin, China's president, that Beijing was "on the wrong side of history," or his repeated harsh critiques of Fidel Castro.
Even though Mr. Clinton scaled back his human rights message, President Tran Duc Luong and the government's chief economic reformer, Prime Minister Phan Van Khai, stiffened today when he brought up the subject in private meetings. Both men, according to American officials, said "we may have different definitions of human rights," and said they had to worry about the rights of Vietnamese to eat and get an education before they moved toward America's agenda.
But the diplomatic wordplay was overwhelmed by the surreal images, starting with the sight of the Presidential limousine winding through Hanoi's streets with a Vietnamese flag on one fender, the Stars and Stripes on the other.
For a few moments today there was concern when the crowds grew overenthusiastic. Mr. Clinton plunged into a crowd on a busy shopping street and to the brief alarm of the Secret Service was mobbed by a crowd eager to touch any piece of his clothing. After a few minutes, security agents pulled Mr. Clinton out of the crowd and into his car.
But within minutes he was out of his car again, along a street of small shops selling everything from dishwashers to pirated music on cassette tapes and CD's. He popped into a cooperative that sells fabrics and purses and other goods made in the countryside, buying Christmas presents for his family.
Then he took his staff to lunch at a small cafe called Know One, Teach One that is well known in the city for giving jobs to the capital's young homeless. A bit shocked, the young waiters fumbled with soups and sandwiches as they ran up and down a narrow stairway to serve the meal.
The whole city seemed equally surprised. Mr. Clinton's visit was not a secret, of course, but the government had done nothing to promote a large turnout to greet him. The articles that ran in Vietnam's obedient newspapers about the president's imminent arrival were small and understated. A hard-fought soccer match pitting Vietnam against Indonesia won far larger billing on television, along with details of government plans to build new roads.
There was only one banner celebrating the arrival of "President William Jefferson Clinton and Spouse" visible to those entering the city. Today was an ordinary workday.
But people came anyway. The crowds lined Mr. Clinton's route, never cheering but constantly waving, children and grandchildren held aloft to catch a glimpse of the largest motorcade this city has ever seen.
Just before 4 p.m., people gathered in front of television sets in storefronts to catch Mr. Clinton's half-hour speech, an oddity in a country where the leadership feels no need to explain itself. The White House had provided the government with a translation of the speech into Vietnamese because, as one administration official put it, "we've learned the hard way what happens when you let your host do its own translation."
It was unclear if any of Mr. Clinton's phrases were altered to fit the Communist Party's liking when the translation was read by a Vietnamese as the president spoke.
Mr. Clinton said he arrived here "conscious that the histories of our two nations are deeply intertwined in ways that are both a source of pain for generations that came before, and a source of promise for generations yet to come." He cited phrases about life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness that Ho Chi Minh had lifted from Jefferson in writing Vietnam's own version of a declaration of independence.
But he quickly moved to his now-familiar arguments about the new age of mutual dependence, telling his audience that globalization "is the economic equivalent of a force of nature" and that it "is not going away." Vietnam, he said, must learn to harness it "like wind or water." And he told the student elite of the country that "your next job may well depend on foreign trade and investment."
"Come to think of it," he said, "since I have to leave office in about eight weeks, my next job may depend on foreign trade and investment."
He delicately argued that Vietnam's people should support the reformers in the government who are pressing for a loosening of the state controls that have choked the economy here and sent foreign investors fleeing.
"Only you can decide if you will continue to open your markets, open your society and strengthen the rule of law," he said. "Only you can decide how to weave individual liberties and human rights into the rich and strong fabric of Vietnamese national identity."
It is not clear how the argument will play out in the behind-the-scenes power struggle that appears under way here in Hanoi between conservatives who fear that economic opening will undermine their power and economic reformers who say that the only other choice is an economic spiral downward. Right now, the conservatives appear to have the upper hand.
"That's for the moment," a senior administration official said tonight. "You look at all those young people" who came out to greet the president today, he said. "It's going to be hard to tell them what to think."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Europeans Seek $4 Billion in Trade Sanctions Against U.S.

BYLINE: By PAUL MELLER

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Nov. 17

 BODY:
The European Union asked the World Trade Organization today to approve more than $4 billion in trade sanctions on American products to retaliate for what it says is an illegal tax break granted to exporters in the United States.
The request for punitive tariffs, the largest ever sought from the trade organization, came one day after President Clinton signed a law replacing the tax arrangement at issue with another, delaying until at least June the time when sanctions could become effective. 
 In its request, the Europeans submitted a list of 99 product groups including soaps, paper products, confections, aircraft and sports accessories that would affect some of the nation's biggest exporters, like Procter & Gamble, Mars, Boeing and Nike.
The United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, and the deputy Treasury secretary, Stuart E. Eizenstat, said in a joint statement that the United States would "contest the level of damages alleged by the E.U."
The W.T.O. has already ruled against the United States in the trade dispute, agreeing with Europe's contention that a tax program favoring United States exporters, known as the Foreign Sales Corporation, provided illegal subsidies.
Anthony Gooch, a spokesman for the European Union, said $4 billion "is a reasonable estimation of the damages the E.U. has incurred as a result of the U.S. Foreign Sales Corporation program."
"The figure of just over $4 billion the E.U. is claiming in damages makes other trade disputes between the E.U. and U.S. pale into insignificance," he said.
The Foreign Sales Corporation, which was established in 1984, allows United States corporations to avoid taxes on revenues generated from exports if they are booked through a foreign subsidiary.
The program has reduced United States companies' export tax bills by as much as 30 percent a year, giving them a competitive advantage over their European competitors not just in markets in Europe, but globally, Mr. Gooch said.
"This case is of major importance for European companies as the sectors that benefit the most" from the arrangement are ones in which United States and European companies "fiercely compete," he said. The sectors include chemicals, pharmaceuticals, machinery, electrical equipment and transportation equipment, according to the European Commission, the European Union's executive arm.
The product groups on the list are ones where European dependence on products from the United States is low and where the sanctions would not affect consumers and industry in Europe, Mr. Gooch said.
Agricultural products including cereals, meat and dairy products are included, as are more specialized products like fur skins, nuclear reactors and imitation jewelry. The United States exports $160 billion worth of products to Europe annually.
The law President Clinton signed on Thursday actually offers more tax relief -- up to $6 billion annually -- to companies that export goods or manufacture them abroad. But companies would not need to channel sales through offshore subsidiaries, which are often situated in tax havens; they would get the tax breaks directly.
The Clinton administration says the W.T.O. will soon decide in its favor, ending the matter. The European Union maintains that the new law is merely an expansion of the old one and has said that it still plans to impose sanctions pending a fresh victory at the trade organization.
"The E.U. believes that the new law not only maintains the violations found by the W.T.O. in the F.S.C. case but may even aggravate them," the European Commission said.
Ms. Barshefsky and Mr. Eizenstat said: "We regret that the E.U. has not accepted our new legislation. We continue to strongly believe that it is W.T.O.-compliant."
The European Union has asked the trade group to examine the new export tax legislation. "Although we believe the F.S.C. replacement legislation does not solve the problem," the Europeans will leave it to the trade group to rule on the matter, said Pascal Lamy, the European Union's trade commissioner.
No sanctions would be imposed until the W.T.O. has ruled on the new legislation, according to the statement from Ms. Barshefsky and Mr. Eizenstat. The trade group is not expected to rule on the new legislation before early next summer.
Asked why Europe is seeking W.T.O. authority for its sanctions and not pushing ahead with them immediately, as the United States did early last year in its retaliatory move against European banana import rules, Mr. Gooch said: "Two wrongs don't make a right. We want to de-escalate this dispute, so we are following all the proper measures."
In the banana dispute, the United States imposed 100 percent tariffs on selected European imports -- a trade sanction worth $300 million a year -- in response to what it says are unfair import restrictions on bananas and hormone-treated beef.

HEADLINE: JOURNAL;
May the Best Man Lose

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
The Gods of Bloviation have spoken. It's the Florida Fiasco. It's thisclose to a Constitutional Crisis. Maybe, declared ABC's Cokie Roberts last Sunday, it's "the most partisan time that we have seen in our lives." Or, as the Dean of D.C., David Broder, sermonized, "This nation has rarely appeared more divided than it does right now."
Oh, please. A more partisan time than the impeachment of less than two years ago? A more divided America than that of Vietnam or even the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas hearings? Then why has just about everybody except Al Gore, George W. Bush and their fiercest partisans had so much fun? 
 Whatever else may be the legacy of the Clinton years, one thing is certain: The disconnect lives on. The apocalyptic shrillness generated by the Washington establishment, and amplified 24/7 by TV's latest media thon, is utterly askew from the mood in the country. As the talking heads were shocked by polls revealing that Americans didn't want Bill Clinton sent packing at the height of Monicagate, so they were taken aback by polls revealing that the benighted citizenry has the patience to wait out a deadlocked election.
The reason for this national equanimity is obvious. Collectively Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush have succeeded in uniting the country in exactly one bipartisan belief -- that neither of them deserves to be president. The election result, a tie, was the perfect, indeed patriotic outcome to the cynical, scripted campaign they both ran: Let them both lose. And now, thanks to the political, legal and media histrionics of the post-election campaign, our unspoken wish has come true. Both will lose -- no matter who is the nominal winner.
Even were the entire country able to conduct a "re-vote" of the election, it's hard to imagine vastly different results. Since Nov. 7, both candidates have only ratified the voters' judgment that neither man is deserving of a mandate or capable of rising above his considerable limitations.
Mr. Gore's public protestation that what he is "focused on" is "not the contest, but our democracy" offers yet further confirmation of his unctuous disingenuousness. (And who but Mr. Gore would ostentatiously pay a visit to the movie "Men of Honor" when trying to prove he is one?) Mr. Bush, who chose to start a transition while ballots were still being counted and then hid for days behind the heavily pomaded visage of Daddy's old consigliere James Baker, is still the entitled rich kid who relies on family retainers and old-boy connections to carry him through a crisis. But as Mr. Gore's touch-football photo op didn't turn him into a Kennedy, neither did Mr. Bush's facial bandage transform him into John McCain. These guys are interim leaders for an interim age, and all the recounts in the world are not going to alter either's DNA.
This is why voter turnout was what the election expert Curtis Gans characterized as "very low," despite the buckets of money spent and the widespread expectation of a historic photo finish in which every vote might count. As late as Election Eve, Harvard's Vanishing Voter measure of "voter involvement" in the election stood at 50 percent, with 48 percent deeming the race "boring."
The only antidote to the boredom was the merciful departure of the candidates from center stage. Once they did exit, on Election Night, America tuned in. The TV audience for the returns jumped 63 percent from four years ago -- even clearing the crucial cultural threshold of outnumbering the audience for the final episode of "Survivor." Within days, the Vanishing Voter involvement index skyrocketed to 73 percent, with only 17 percent declaring themselves bored. "This is better than the Subway Series," one New York voter told The Washington Post -- and he's right. What makes it better is that the election now has become an extra-inning sports event being played by ever-changing rules more complicated than those of championship bridge. At last we have the Olympics competition we were deprived of in the fall, being played out in real time.
Like a post-season sports competition, the post-election is not a fierce partisan civil war so much as a nearly substance-free battle over the single, non-ideological issue of who will win and who will lose. What else is at stake here? Not a civil rights debate, or the prosecution of a war, or the prosecution of a president, or even the ascendancy of liberalism or conservatism. In the gridlocked, divided Congress at hand, Mr. Bush isn't going to be able to bring off a mammoth tax cut or appoint a new Justice Thomas; Mr. Gore won't be able to bloat entitlements. If this is a partisan fight deeply dividing a nation, as our pundits purport, it's all form and no content. Instead of the Blue vs. the Gray, we have a scorched-earth war between two prescription-drug plans.
Another cliche of the moment has it that, whatever else is happening, we are at least witnessing a fine civics lesson that will benefit the nation's callow youth. Well, everyone now knows what the Electoral College is, but beyond that lies P.R. and legal wrangling more redolent of a class-action lawsuit than the Continental Congress. When the Republicans start championing federal authority and the Democrats the autonomy of the states, it's clear that there are no principles at stake beyond those of Vince Lombardi.
For all the self-congratulatory talk about our civics lesson, the one real civic crisis to emerge from Decision 2000 is played down on TV: the erroneous manipulation of the public by false and premature predictions on Election Night. The stampede to award Mr. Bush Florida -- and the presidency -- began on Rupert Murdoch's Fox News Channel at 2:16 a.m. and was uncannily echoed by all the other networks in the ensuing four minutes. Thanks to Jane Mayer of The New Yorker, we now know how the Fox call setting off this avalanche was engineered in part by John Ellis, a Bush first cousin in charge of the we-report-you-decide network's prediction desk. Billy Tauzin, a Republican from Louisiana, is calling for Congressional hearings on the entire panoply of network behavior of Nov. 7. This could be the best Congressional circus of its genre since Charles Van Doren starred in the game-show investigations of the 50's.
It may certainly prove more scintillating than what appears to be the election's litigious endgame. Tedium is the great leveler in America's news epics, and in the past 48 hours you could feel the nation putting itself to sleep by counting Florida judges. By Wednesday night MSNBC was so desperate to find partisan clowns other than the omnipresent camera-hog-without-portfolio Alan Simpson that it dug up former Senator Dennis DeConcini, a long-departed Arizona Democrat, and the cryogenically preserved Steve Forbes. By Thursday my local NBC affiliate was trying to hold viewers with stories like "Learn why Cher refused to take part in Jesse Jackson's protest!" and by yesterday MSNBC had added what soon proved to be a gratuitous absentee-ballot countdown clock, a perfect segue into today's real sports event in Tallahassee, the Florida-Florida State game.
This is going to play out on television for the entire next four years," said NBC's Tim Russert. Not when the ratings tank. Unlike the impeachment mediathon, this one lacks the crucial crowd-pleasing element of sex.
Whatever the election's outcome, the result is likely to be the same anyway. If Mr. Bush wins, especially without taking the popular vote, the Democrats will delegitimize the election in any way they can, taking particular delight in pursuing that Sunshine State Evita, Katherine Harris -- a political gift who will keep on giving. Should Mr. Gore win, that old band of Vincent Foster conspiracy theorists will reunite to target Palm Beach County Commissioner Carol Roberts and the rest of her chad-counters; Dan Burton will lead the investigation into what The Wall Street Journal has already labeled an attempted Democratic coup d'etat. Two years from now, the party that controls the White House is likely to lose untold seats in Congress as well, frustrating the "winning" president's ability to govern even further. If an economic downturn is thrown into the mix, the president who presides over it may find himself and his party consigned to long-term political oblivion.
This is one year when it's probably better to be a sore loser than a sore winner. But such is the narrow vision of both contenders that they may be the last people in America to figure that out.

HEADLINE: The Cost of Crossing the Hudson

 BODY:
Commuters may soon have to pay more to cross the Hudson River. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is considering a plan to increase tolls at several bridges and tunnels, as well as fares on the PATH train under the river. Such a move is long overdue. Price hikes are inherently painful, but these are worth applauding, if not demanding, as a matter of fairness and a means to fight congestion.
The PATH trains' 240,000 daily riders, predominantly New Jersey residents who commute to work in Manhattan, currently enjoy one of the last great deals around -- a flat $1 fare. The Port Authority's proposal calls for raising that to $1.50 for commuters who use QuickCards, and up to $2 for riders who pay in cash. By bringing its fare for frequent riders in line with that paid by New York subway commuters, the Port Authority would go a long way toward dispelling New Yorkers' perception that the agency disproportionately favors New Jersey. 
 That perception lay at the heart of a rift between the two states and their governors that paralyzed the Port Authority for more than a year. As part of the settlement that broke the impasse in June, New Jersey agreed to a Port Authority study of a possible PATH fare increase, essentially telegraphing that it would happen.
It does not take much study to reckon that an aging train system requiring an annual subsidy of $180 million -- not to mention a major capital investment -- should not be offering its passengers such a bargain fare. The increased revenue will be spent on new equipment, as part of the Port Authority's five-year capital investment plan.
The other proposed toll increases, to $7 from $4 for a rush-hour round trip at the Holland and Lincoln tunnels and the George Washington Bridge for drivers paying cash, can also be defended on fairness grounds. That is, after all, the round-trip amount that commuters from Queens crossing the East River on the Triborough Bridge pay. It simply makes no sense for some people to pay substantially less for the privilege of driving their vehicles onto one of the most congested islands on earth simply because they are coming from New Jersey.
Beyond its fairness, the plan's embrace of congestion pricing is most heartening. Transportation authorities can no longer ignore basic economics and price a vehicle's use of a regional asset -- be it a bridge, a turnpike, a tunnel or an airport runway -- with no regard to demand for that asset when used. Access to the Holland Tunnel is a scarce resource at 8:30 in the morning and should not be priced the same at midnight. The Port Authority's plan smartly recognizes this by offering trucks deep discounts to enter the city in the middle of the night instead of during the day. Commuters with an E-ZPass, which alleviates congestion at toll booths, also get a break.
By the authority's own estimate, traffic congestion costs the region $9 billion a year, and it is time to price the usage of all transportation assets to reflect, and try to change, that reality. Political leaders in the region ought to support the Port Authority's plan.

HEADLINE: Clinton in Vietnam, and America's Legacy

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Clinton to Try to Juggle Past Horrors and Future Hopes on Vietnam Visit" (news article, Nov. 15): 
 The insistence of the United States that Vietnam account for all American soldiers still listed as missing in action is an unrealistic and unjust impediment to the improvement of relations between two countries that share remarkable similarities.
Our misguided intervention in Vietnam's civil war had catastrophic consequences for the Vietnamese: millions died, hundreds of thousands of soldiers are still missing in action, and tens of thousands of children suffer from horrendous birth defects that can be credibly linked to American use of defoliants like Agent Orange.
It is unseemly that our government continues to punish the people of Vietnam economically. Vietnam's brave defiance of colonial oppression and its endurance of an ugly civil war are strikingly reminiscent of the history of another nation far, far away -- a nation that should grow up and do all it can to improve the lives it scarred.

HEADLINE: Arts Center Plan Is Sole Bid to Restore Armory

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

 BODY:
A nonprofit group of civic leaders who propose to turn the dilapidated Seventh Regiment Armory on Park Avenue into an important arts center has submitted the only bid for rehabilitating and operating it, state officials said yesterday.
Because there are no other bids, the group, the Seventh Regiment Armory Conservancy, is likely to win the right to develop and run the armory, a landmark building that occupies a full block between 66th and 67th Streets. 
 "We're pleased to receive an exciting proposal," said Charles A. Gargano, the chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, the state's economic development arm. "This is a magnificent project that's going to be another jewel for cultural events in New York."
Mr. Gargano cautioned, however, that the state must still review the conservancy's proposal and determine whether it is feasible.
"They haven't been selected yet," he said. "We just cracked open the proposal."
Last Wednesday was the deadline for submitting bids in response to a request that the state issued in July. But there is no deadline for awarding the contract, state officials said.
Built between 1877 and 1881, the armory is one of the country's leading exhibition halls for art, antiques and crafts. But after years of neglect, it has deteriorated badly.
Members of the conservancy, who learned only yesterday that theirs was the only bid for the armory, said they would continue to rent space for exhibitions but would also use the building for performances by major arts and entertainment companies.
"The overriding purpose," said Wade F. B. Thompson, the chairman of the conservancy, "is to restore the building to the highest standards and to revitalize it as a world class cultural institution." He estimated that achieving that goal would cost about $100 million in private and public money. Mr. Thompson said the group had already spent several hundred thousand dollars to develop its plans over the last four years.
Under the conservancy's proposal, the New York Philharmonic would perform in the armory for two or three weeks in the summer, said Eric Latzky, a spokesman for the orchestra.
"The whole idea is to approach programming in a different way," Mr. Latzky said, "to do things that we could not do or for some reason wouldn't at Avery Fisher Hall."
Another major cultural institution that would play a role in the restored armory is the Whitney Museum of American Art.
Another conservancy board member, Rebecca Robertson, the former president of the 42nd Street Project, said the group envisioned a large space where dance and theater could be performed in the round, without the constraints imposed by a proscenium stage. The plans also call for a high-end restaurant.
Like Ms. Robertson, a city planner who is now the manager of the $1.5 billion Lincoln Center reconstruction project, several members of the conservancy board have weighty credentials. Among them are Richard Ravitch, a developer and the former chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority; Elihu Rose, the developer; Kent Barwick, the president of the Municipal Art Society; and Richard Blinder, a senior partner in Beyer Blinder Belle, the architectural firm that restored Grand Central Terminal.
In addition to the performing and visual arts, the restoration will also emphasize the armory's military history and its importance in the decorative arts. The building has a dozen ornate rooms that were decorated by some of the nation's most prominent interior designers.
But apart from the huge fund-raising challenge that lies ahead, the conservancy will have other difficult issues to resolve. The Seventh Regiment Fund, a private organization, has been involved in a long legal battle with the state over the armory's multimillion-dollar collection of paintings and military regalia.
David L. Dalva II, an antiques dealer and the group's vice president, said yesterday that the fund claims ownership of the interior walls of the armory, not just paintings and sculpture, and intends to keep fighting the state unless a compromise can be worked out.
And then there is the matter of what to do with the shelter for homeless women that has occupied the third and fifth floors of the armory for about 15 years. Bidders for the armory were not required to incorporate the shelter into their plans, but conservancy board members said they wanted to work with the state perhaps to find another site for the shelter.
When the bidding process was announced, Mr. Gargano said he expected several proposals. But yesterday, he said that given the expense of renovating the armory, "we understand why the commercial developers chose not to get involved."
Ms. Robertson said that once the state approved the bid, it would probably take 18 months to two years to raise money for the restoration project and complete the plans.

I Love You
 Like Crazy Cakes
 By Rose Lewis.
 Illustrated by Jane Dyer.
 Unpaged. Boston:
 Little, Brown & Company. $14.95.
 (Ages 4 to 8) 
 Any children's book about adoption is apt to draw sticky questions from its young readers, especially a book about cross-cultural adoption. "I Love You Like Crazy Cakes," a richly illustrated picture book by Rose Lewis, a first-time author and adoptive mother, provides a lovely context in which to field some of those questions.
The book is essentially a love letter from mother to daughter. It recounts the author's real-life journey -- from the United States to China and back again -- to meet and carry home her adopted baby girl. Complementing the fairy-tale quality of the text are watercolors by the well-known illustrator Jane Dyer, whose luminous images help to soften the more difficult aspects of the story -- in particular, the unknown fate of the baby's biological mother.
Intended for children from 4 to 8 years of age, the text does not attempt to explain why so many infant girls in China are orphans. Lewis may assume that most adult readers are familiar with China's one-child policy, which -- along with a deep cultural preference for boys and widespread economic hardship -- has helped create a generation of unwanted Chinese girls.
But, as is appropriate in a book for very young children, Lewis chooses not to dwell on the causes of her daughter's abandonment and instead highlights what she and the girl have gained in finding each other. Throughout the short narrative, the mother expresses wonder at the magic of the gift that has come to her. Addressing her daughter, she exclaims: "When you looked at me with those big brown eyes, I knew we belonged together. 'I love you like crazy cakes,' I whispered. How did this happen? How did someone make this perfect match a world away?"
Dyer's full-page illustrations are equally direct and joyful. Young children will respond to the large images of the mother and daughter's gentle faces. The paintings of planes flying through nighttime and daytime skies between the United States and China invite children to ponder geography and the sky above their own homes. Even the orphanage depicted on the book's first two pages is an airy and orderly place -- Dyer's warm pastels spread across the page like a blanket, familiar and comforting.
Still, children are likely to ask a host of questions in response to the basic facts of the story: Am I adopted? Where is the Chinese mommy? Where is the daddy? Why do the mommy and baby look different? Though the adoptive mother in the story is Caucasian and, apparently, single, Lewis does not call attention to these details. They are, to some degree, peripheral to the story's real focus, which is the way the mother and daughter have filled each other's need for connection.
That the narrator speaks in the first person and addresses the daughter directly brings readers young and old into the characters' intimate circle. For adopted children, the book may prove especially useful, providing insight into the feelings of their own adoptive parents.
Although Lewis maintains a light touch throughout the book, it closes with the American mother crying for the lost Chinese mother: "I wanted her to know that we would always remember her." This is an important sentiment that acknowledges the daughter's origins and the adoptive mother's debt. It also, however, reminds us of the losses running just underneath the surface of the story and how they seem to have no explanation. That is where the book ends and where we -- mothers and fathers, aunts and uncles, grandmothers and grandfathers -- must step in.

 One Market Under God
 Extreme Capitalism, Market Populism, and the End of Economic Democracy.
 By Thomas Frank.
 414 pp. New York:
 Doubleday. $26. 
 So, are you better off now than you were four years ago? Did you buy Cisco on a dip? Did you retire 10 years earlier than you expected, or otherwise live out some previously unthinkable "new economy" fantasy? O.K., so the stock indexes have not had a terribly good year, but mutual fund inflows continue apace, and it is difficult to have a conversation about any issue without someone offering up the ideal "market solution" for how to keep all this prosperity going.
This, in other words, is a very, very lonely time in which to attempt a flat-out assault on market culture. Thomas Frank seems well aware of this state of affairs, but he is obviously undaunted. "One Market Under God: Extreme Capitalism, Market Populism, and the End of Economic Democracy" is a 414-page exercise in skepticism that possesses all the subtlety of a Molotov cocktail. What he offers is an alternative history of the great bull market, and especially of the last four years. In particular he wants to make the connection -- as Ronald Reagan did by asking voters in 1980 if they felt better off or not -- between politics and personal finance.
Stage 1 in Frank's history is the so-called culture war, in which the right, starting with Richard Nixon in 1968, redefined the elite-versus-populist division: The masses were no longer set against the corporate chieftains, but instead were encouraged to see intellectuals, academics and liberals in general as their great cultural foe. This enabled corporate America to re-enter the picture as what Frank calls "market populists," insisting that "by its very nature the market was democratic, perfectly expressing the popular will through the machinery of supply and demand, poll and focus group, superstore and Internet." Bill Clinton shook hands with Newt Gingrich, "the signal that the historical opponent to the business party was no longer interested in opposing." And from there it was a short ride to the notion that the ability to trade stocks online was a form of empowerment.
Frank, who edits a journal called The Baffler, attacks this market-populist narrative in the style of a literary theorist, poring over the words and images of, among others, George Gilder, Lester Thurow, Thomas Friedman, Walter Wriston, Warren Buffett, Peter Lynch, The Motley Fool, online brokerage advertising, Wired magazine and business and personal finance magazines generally. At times his eye is sharp, as when he notes the willingness of some "corporate rebels" to compare themselves to the Khmer Rouge, or describes an ad in which I.B.M. "passes the hot potato of wowlessness" to clueless Japanese organization men. One of his best points is to identify inevitability as a "sort of logical atom bomb" of market populists, who love to flaunt their iron laws and paradigms. "The market will give you a voice, empower you to do whatever you want to do," Frank summarizes, "and if you have any doubts about that, then the market will crush you and everything you've ever known."
As it happens, I am extremely familiar with some of the material that so ticks Frank off, having worked as an editor at SmartMoney, Fortune and Money during the period that is the main time frame for his scorn. He gives a few lopsided interpretations of this or that article or book, but he doesn't actually do anything outside the bounds of the usual mischief of rhetoric. In fact, my familiarity makes me more sympathetic to his core argument, not less so. I think Frank is right to counter the notion that buying stocks is a subversive act that is somehow equal to the spirit of punk rock or the civil rights crusade. Buying stocks is a way to increase your personal net worth. Perhaps doing so will result in some greater personal freedom; that does not make it an act of social rebellion.
That said, the book is pretty uneven. There is a lot of repetition and a fair amount of tedium; a long chapter on academia is particularly grueling. Because Frank is more of a critic than a reporter, some of his offhand observations are maddeningly vague. For instance, he makes a short and unconvincing argument that in general American corporate managers have been rewarded "in proportion to the amount of power and security that workers lost," and elsewhere he matter-of-factly attributes the whole of Jack Welch's success at General Electric to layoffs. You can make a case about this, but it would take more than the few sentences that Frank offers.
Finally, there is something about Frank's idea of a kind of revolution from above that I find unconvincing, partly because I think it lets Main Street off the hook a little too easily. He trumpets the multiple by which Welch's income exceeds that of a typical worker, and the latest statistics about increasing wealth inequality, as if these were covered-up facts that will surely galvanize the reader. But will they? They haven't up to now.
At one point Frank discusses the proposition that Peter Lynch deserves middle-class hero status because people stop him on the street to thank him for running the popular Fidelity Magellan Fund so well that it allowed them to accumulate a bigger retirement nest egg, or to pay for their kid's tuition, or to build an addition to their home. Frank of course sees no heroism in this, and counters that "each of these necessities -- pensions, shelter, college -- were things Americans had once sought to ensure through union activity or government intervention, things that Americans once believed were theirs simply by virtue of being citizens, things that could and should be available to everyone in a democratic society."
Yes, except that the key here is that no one thanks Lynch for "shelter," they thank him for the extra cash to add a rumpus room. I agree with Frank that this is a sad definition of heroism. It seems that a large and important segment of the American public has simply decided that it is less necessary for society to provide a floor beneath which no one can sink than it is to make sure that there is absolutely no ceiling limiting how high one might fly. But I don't think that these citizen shareholders have come to this view because of anything Peter Lynch or George Gilder said. I think they came to it because they are better off now than they were four years ago.

HEADLINE: A Hatred Smoldering In the Hills

BYLINE: By Michael Finkel; Michael Finkel's last article for the magazine was about sailing illegally to America with a group of Haitian refugees.

 BODY:
Of all the odd and misguided tenets by which Eddie Vaughn lived his life, perhaps the most troubling was his view of the law. "There's the law way, and there's my way," is a maxim Vaughn frequently repeated. He expressed this doctrine by beating his wife and dealing in narcotics and pulling a gun or a knife on whoever he felt required it. Anyone who believed in the righteousness or sanctity of the legal system was, by definition, Vaughn's enemy. He had a temper both violent and unpredictable, and even those who admired him realized that if Vaughn were to encounter the wrong person, in the wrong situation, he was liable to impose a punishment of his own furious creation.
Fred Capps was a lawyer. He was a state prosecutor, a zealous -- some have said excessively zealous -- defender of the law, a man with morals so rigidly defined that he was usually loath to pursue anything less than the maximum possible punishment. "With Fred it was either right or it was wrong," says one of his closest friends. "There was no soft middle." During trials, Capps was so intense that he could neither sleep nor eat nor discuss anything other than the case at hand. His reverence for the law was as strong as Vaughn's disdain, and his abilities in a courtroom were at once remarkable and daunting. To Fred Capps, the notion of removing from society people like Eddie Vaughn was his life's motivating force. To Eddie Vaughn, the idea of being punished by a man like Fred Capps was his vision of hell -- in fact, as it turned out, he deemed it a fate worse than death.
It is clear that people like Eddie Vaughn and Fred Capps should never come near each other, and in a big city or even a large town they probably would not. But Vaughn and Capps were reared in the same tiny place, a community called Burkesville, nestled deep within the Cumberland Mountains of far southern Kentucky. 
 Eddie Vaughn grew up in the highlands that surround Burkesville, the brilliant green foothills of the Cumberlands, where he could throw his knives and grow his pot and fire his shotgun and no one would care to trouble him. The Cumberland hills are quarters to bootlegging businesses -- prohibition remains in effect in most of southern Kentucky -- as well as marijuana plantations and cockfighting rings, none of which would benefit from the notice of policemen or sheriff's deputies. And so the people who live in these hills are schooled in a sort of home-brewed Hammurabi's Code known as "country justice" and indoctrinated with a distinct sense of apartness. Here, the seasons are often referred to by the cycles of the tobacco crops (planting, blooming, cutting and curing), the chickens run free and many of the mobile homes appear to have surrendered to gravity and slumped into the hillsides.
Fred Capps was from the valley, the flat, fertile flood plain of the Cumberland River, upon which all of Burkesville's commercial buildings are clustered. In town, every third building seems to be a church, and the largest structure is the Cumberland County Courthouse, a boxy, solemn edifice, made of stone and brick, that appears to announce that this is a law-and-order kind of place. Life in the Burkesville valley literally revolves around it. Main Street encloses the courthouse within a traffic circle, and along the outer perimeter of this circle are the town's chief businesses -- the Cumberland County News; the Corner Pool and Lunch; Smith Pharmacy; Keith's Barber Shop; and Capps's law office, out of which Fred Capps served as commonwealth's attorney. Whittling is still a practiced time-killer in Burkesville, and little mounds of cedar shavings can be seen beneath the benches outside the courthouse. The town is home to exactly one stoplight, which means there are more stoplights than there are movie theaters, or bookstores, or restaurants serving anything more daring than cheeseburgers. The homes in the valley tend to be fancier-looking than those in the hills, and there are no chickens, free range or otherwise, anywhere in town.
Burkesville, in fact, is one of the more isolated places in the United States. It's an hour's drive to the closest Interstate, past the villages of Marrowbone and Willow Shade and Nobob. Every morning, provoked by the warm, pale-green waters of the Cumberland River, a thick layer of fog hovers above town, stuffing the gaps between the hills like chinking and giving an observer the impression that nothing exists in the lands beyond except an endless lather of clouds. To many locals, any place outside Cumberland County is known, quite simply, as "off."
Very few families move to Burkesville -- there's not one housing development under construction in the entire county -- and those already there tend to measure their nativeness in terms of generations rather than years. The first mention of both a Vaughn and a Capps in the book "History of Cumberland County" happens to occur in the very same sentence, one that describes a group of vigilantes in 1861. Neither family, it seemed, ever got a dollar ahead. This is hardly surprising; even today, almost everyone in Cumberland County is poor: the median annual household income is less than $18,000. Nearly one-third of the residents live below the poverty line, and 60 percent of the adults have not graduated from high school. The county's population is currently 6,800, which is less than it was in 1980.
Vaughn's parents were tenant farmers who worked modest corn and tobacco plots in the Burkesville hills. Eddie, born in 1950, was the oldest of nine children and often had to attend school barefoot -- a state of undress he apparently adapted to, for he continued to embrace it even after developing various clothing and grooming fetishes later in life. Capps, born in 1953, was the older of two brothers; his mother labored in a garment mill, his dad in a machine shop. The principal difference between the two men was less economic than geographic: Vaughn lived in the hills; Capps was from the valley.
Eddie Vaughn and Fred Capps were not strangers to each other. They were not strangers to anyone in Burkesville. Rather, they were two of the best known people in Cumberland County. If Burkesville is divided into two loose circles -- those who live in the hills and those who live in town -- then Vaughn and Capps represented the extreme outliers of each of their worlds. They are worlds that seem to foster extraordinary allegiance: Fred Capps never wanted to live anywhere else, and Eddie Vaughn, though he spent several years away from Burkesville, always returned to the Cumberland hills.
Some small towns -- those, say, amid the farmlands of the Great Plains, which are often celebrated as icons of American spaciousness -- feel like distant outposts in a giant realm. Not Burkesville. Instead, Burkesville feels as though it is the epicenter of its own little kingdom, with the Cumberland Mountains serving as ramparts. Conversations at the Pool and Lunch, even political ones, seem always to be focused on local characters. The two dozen pages of the weekly Cumberland County News frequently contain not a single story from off. There is something about such insularity -- something about the press of the mountains and the changelessness of the citizenry and the somnolence of the days -- that causes differences to be amplified rather than dissipated. Citizens still talk about the woman who came (briefly) from off who did not shave her underarms. Walk one lap around the courthouse with a cell phone pressed to your ear and you'll be branded a city slicker for life. A local barbecue restaurant owned by an outsider whom the town has decided is a hippie has been informally boycotted and is now for sale. Amid this mind-set, within this ring of mountains, it isn't surprising that two men as forceful as Eddie Vaughn and Fred Capps could not remain separated forever.
They attended the same elementary school, albeit briefly. Vaughn dropped out after the fourth grade, having mastered neither reading nor writing. As a youth, he was a known troublemaker. "He was the type of person," says David Williams, who grew up in Burkesville -- in town -- and is now president of the Kentucky State Senate, "you'd cross the street to avoid encountering." Over the years, Vaughn compiled a police record that included arrests for disorderly conduct, public intoxication and marijuana possession. He continually struggled with his temper and his addictions, both to alcohol and drugs. "One minute he'd be fine," says his mother, Versie Young, "and the next he'd be berserk. It was like a switch was thrown in his head."
Capps was a diminutive, pedantic child; serious, intense, moral almost to a fault. "He always had a poetry book under his arm," recalls Williams, "and he was never particularly social." In a yearbook photo of the 1971 Cumberland County High School senior officers, Fred (the class secretary) is peering from behind Coke-bottle glasses and is the only one wearing a tie. He looks about five years younger than anyone else in the picture. Even in adulthood his face -- blue-eyed and wrinkleless -- never came within a decade of his age. Capps put himself through Western Kentucky University by working as a welder; his Basic Ferrous Welding certificate is hanging on his office wall next to his college diploma.
Both men married women with local ties, and married them young -- Patricia Ferguson was 15 when she wed Eddie Vaughn, who was 10 years her senior; Catherine Brown was 16 when she wed Fred Capps, who was 4 years older. For Vaughn, marriage initiated a reign of abuse. "My dad beat my mom just about every day of my life," says Tommie Vaughn, the couple's only child, who is now 24. "He'd get ideas in his head like my mom was cheating on him, and he'd go crazy." Vaughn never held a steady job; he never received a driver's license. In the early 80's, the Vaughns moved to Louisville, though most summers they returned to the Cumberland hills. Several years ago, Vaughn had a cancerous left kidney removed, and federal disability payments of $760 a month constituted the bulk of the family income.
Fred Capps attended law school at Northern Kentucky University, then promptly headed home to Burkesville. In 1982 he joined a law practice with his wife, Cathi, and 12 years later he was elected commonwealth's attorney, serving as state prosecutor in Cumberland and three adjacent counties. "He was a workaholic and a perfectionist," says Cathi. "He couldn't turn it off; he could never stop working." He usually operated on less than five hours of sleep, and during pressing trials he'd often drive to his office at 3 or 4 in the morning. As prosecutor, his sense of morality, always strong, became even more solidified. "Most of us, we have to plea-bargain cases; there's just too many to attend to," says Phil Patton, the commonwealth's attorney in the district just west of Capps's. "But Fred was willing to put in all the work. He rarely amended charges. If you violated the law and Fred was prosecuting, you could expect that you were going to prison."
Vaughn was the epitome of a country-justice adherent, one who took the hill dweller's ideal of unquestioned privacy to fanatical degrees. "There was no such thing as friends with my parents," says Tommie. "No one was allowed to visit the house. If someone knocked on our door, my dad would beat him bad enough so that he'd know never to come back." Eddie Vaughn's two passions, according to his son, were fighting and working out. He would exercise for five, six, seven hours a day, curling cinder blocks or punching a bag until he'd split all 10 of his knuckles. Stories of his physical prowess circulate around Burkesville like modern-day Paul Bunyan tales. He could throw a knife so accurately that if a person pressed a dime into a tree 20 yards away, he could sink the tip directly into Roosevelt's ear. He could run a pool table, even with the stipulation that every ball bounce off three rails before hitting the pocket. He could climb up a tree until it began to bend, whereupon he'd hop into another tree without touching the ground, and continue as far as he wanted -- like a squirrel," says his son. He once walked across ice so thin that a dog fell through. He could stand on the floor, leap up, perform a forward flip and land atop a table.
Capps's obsessive work habits spilled into his personal life. He treated the Little League field as though it were his garden, importing Alabama red clay for the infield and continually tending to the grass. He hated crowds, he hated traffic -- He'd drive 30 minutes to avoid sitting in traffic 10," says his brother, Rick Capps -- and he especially hated Bill Clinton (a sentiment widely shared in town). He left southern Kentucky only 10 days a year, when the family vacationed in South Carolina. His favorite meal was a hamburger; he never once in his life flew in an airplane.
He and Cathi had two children, John, now 16, and Lydia, 11, and the demands he placed on his family were sometimes as insurmountable as the workload he placed on himself. "He wasn't the type of person who was free with compliments," says Cathi. To see him smile was a rare event -- so rare that Cathi kept a photo of a grinning Fred on the corner of her desk, to remind her that he could occasionally relax.
Vaughn's most tender affections, it seemed, were for poisonous animals. In his home he kept cages filled with snakes and scorpions and spiders, and he handled them with impunity. He owned one snake for two years, a copperhead named Young Billy, and when it died Vaughn gave him a full burial, including a coffin. Vaughn graffitoed his body with tattoos -- a spider, a cross bearing the inscription "Eddie," a flag wrapped about a skull, a nude woman, a dagger piercing three hearts and "L-O-V-E" spelled across the knuckles of his left hand. On his chest he displayed a blue-and-green tattoo that read "Try Me Baby." He had pale blue eyes and a long nose and hewn cheekbones. His nickname was Fast Eddie, and he posed a longstanding wager to the world: if anybody could land the first punch in a fight with him, he'd never fight again. Apparently, no one ever did. "His goal in life," says Tommie Vaughn, "was to be the toughest guy around. He wanted to be a legend in Cumberland County."
Throughout their lives, Vaughn and Capps were frequent topics of town gossip, with no shortage of admiration or animosity delivered toward either man, depending, generally, upon whether the speaker was from town or from some of the more extremist encampments up in the hills. What is surprising is not that Vaughn and Capps clashed, but that it took nearly four decades before they did. Though when the moment came, even the most cynical souls in Burkesville admitted that the encounter was more virulent and explosive than anyone had anticipated.
It was a 9-year-old girl who brought the two men together. In July 1998, Eddie and Patricia Vaughn moved back to the hills of Burkesville. They'd been there less than three months when the daughter of a neighbor accused Eddie of fondling her genitals through her clothing and then forcing her to touch his genitals. The charges were serious, and they were in the hands of the commonwealth's attorney, Fred Capps. For the first time in his checkered life, Eddie Vaughn was facing significant jail time, perhaps as much as 10 years.
In January 1999, Vaughn was indicted by a grand jury on two counts of child molestation. He spent 49 days in custody before he was freed on bail. After his release, Eddie's behavior was even more erratic than usual. He became convinced that the charges, which he vehemently denied, were part of a personal vendetta orchestrated by the Burkesville elite -- in his mind, those who lived in town -- to force him to leave again. And Fred Capps, he believed, was the totem of that elite. "The people who have power in Burkesville," says Tommie, "wanted my father gone, and they found a way." The young girl, Eddie Vaughn claimed, was upset over her parents' divorce proceedings and wanted to escape from her house and live with the Vaughns. When Vaughn refused her, according to his story, the girl was so upset that she invented the sexual-abuse charges.
While it's true that Vaughn had never before been accused of such a crime and that there were no eyewitnesses to the alleged abuse, the chief investigator on the complaint, Sgt. Lisa Rudzinski of the Kentucky State Police, was convinced that she had a solid case. "Based on the evidence gathered," says Sergeant Rudzinski, "there was obvious probable cause. I caught him in several lies while interviewing him. All of the elements of the crime I believe I had evidence to support."
Even Vaughn's lawyer, Scott Johns of Louisville, agreed that the outlook seemed unfavorable. He suggested to Vaughn that perhaps a guilty plea might result in a lighter sentence, of three years. With good behavior, Johns predicted, Vaughn could be released on parole in less than six months. Upon hearing this, Vaughn blew up. "He was out of his head with anger," says Tommie. "He told me he'd never plead guilty to a crime he didn't commit -- never, ever." In the Cumberland hills, the code of country justice has its own odd yet systematic ideals. It's a dogma that honors fist-fighting and knife-throwing talent, and by these measures, Vaughn was a near legend. But touching a little girl is unacceptable, and a guilty charge on such a crime will forever doom an outlaw to an ignoble existence. In a secluded county where everyone knows everyone, it is difficult to imagine Eddie Vaughn, guilty or not, receiving an impartial trial. And so Vaughn, feeling trapped, arrived at an extreme solution -- extreme, yet possibly the only one in which his reputation would not merely be salvaged but infinitely bolstered.
The trial was set to begin last summer on Monday, June 5. Early that morning, just as dawn was breaking, Eddie forced Patricia to drive him to the home of one of his brothers, James. James lives in a rusty white trailer a few miles back in the Burkesville hills, on a lot populated with cherry trees and peach trees and giant, flamboyant rhododendrons. Eddie and James hadn't spoken in years, since the two argued, violently, over a marijuana deal. The June encounter was also violent. Apparently, Eddie did not know where Fred Capps lived and needed his brother to show him the way. He entered James's home, threatened him with a knife, smashed his telephone and said, "Today is a great day to die."
Eddie decided that James's car, a 1983 Olds Cutlass, would be more dependable than Patricia's scarcely operable Buick, and he shoved James into the driver's seat. Patricia sat next to him. Eddie climbed in back, clutching a Chinese-made SKS semiautomatic rifle, with a banana clip in place holding 30 rounds of ammunition. Also with him was a 16-gauge, single-barrel sawed-off shotgun; a hunting knife with a nine-and-a-half-inch blade; a second hunting knife with a five-and-a-half-inch blade; a lock-blade knife; two boot knives in leather sheaths; a hatchet; a second clip for the SKS; 22 shells for the shotgun; and a pit bull named Redson who was trained to kill at an instant's notice. Eddie was wearing black jeans and a white crew-neck T-shirt, both of which appeared as though they had just come from the dry cleaners. Eddie had a fixation with wearing unblemished attire and would sometimes beat his wife if she hung his jeans improperly. He'd also shower three or four times a day, brush his teeth every hour or so and continually comb his long brown hair, which was now tied back with a pink ribbon. He wore no shoes.
The Cappses' home, a two-story brick colonial house, was emblematic of a valley spread, with a stately circular driveway, a manicured lawn and six slender columns framing a classic Southern front porch adorned with rocking chairs, wicker furniture and hanging plants. Fred and Cathi were asleep in the master bedroom on the first floor. The children were in bed upstairs. It was a little before 6 a.m. Most days, Capps would have been in his office by then, but he'd had a full Sunday -- his kids' piano recital at the Baptist church, several hours of preparation for the Vaughn trial, then coaching duty at a late-evening Little League practice. The car pulled into the driveway, circled partway around and stopped directly in front of the door. Eddie Vaughn opened the rear door and stepped out.
There was no hesitation, not a nod toward stealth. As he strode to the Cappses' front door, Vaughn sprayed the porch with eight quick shots from his semiautomatic rifle, five of which passed through the front window and into the foyer. When he reached the door, he shot 10 more times around the handle and lock, then kicked the door in. The Cappses' neighbors, Mack and Mae Walker, were awake, watching television. They heard the shots. Mack ran to his door, saw Vaughn enter the Cappses' house and shouted for his wife to call the police. She did. It was 5:55 a.m.
Once inside the house, Eddie Vaughn continued firing. By this time, Fred Capps had leapt out of bed. He was wearing boxer shorts and a T-shirt. He poked his head out of his bedroom door. Vaughn turned to his left and leveled his gun at Capps, who dove back into the room. Vaughn approached the room, still shooting. As Fred Capps was reaching between his mattress and box spring, where he kept a loaded .357 Magnum, a bullet penetrated the bedroom wall and struck Capps in the lower back. Wood fragments pried loose by other shots nicked Cathi. Even though the bullet lacerated his liver, punctured his left lung and traveled through his aorta, Capps managed to grab the weapon. He told his wife to get on the intercom and tell the children not to move. Then he spun around and again peeked out of his doorway. At this point, Vaughn had almost reached the room. The two men were less than 10 feet from each other.
The standoff lasted only an instant. Vaughn fired his gun four more times, striking Capps in his abdomen, his neck, his right forearm and again in his lower back. Capps managed to discharge his weapon twice, hitting Vaughn in the upper chest. Both men fell backward, face up, Capps collapsing into his bedroom, onto the beige carpet, his gun flung over his left shoulder, Vaughn toppling to the hardwood floor of the foyer, the stock of his rifle beneath him. The two men's feet, both bare, were scarcely a body's length apart. By the time the police entered the house, three minutes after the neighbors had called, both men were dead.
Some locals believe that life in Burkesville is now irrevocably altered. The town, they say, feels deflated: less innocent, less cheery, less welcoming. A sense of distrust has crept in that can never be extinguished. Families, especially those in the valley, are installing home-alarm systems. More people are applying to carry concealed weapons. The courthouse, once a symbol of security, now seems a mocking reminder of the ultimate triumph of lawlessness.
Other citizens insist that the tragedy has drawn people closer to one another and even, in some ways, has made them proud to be a part of Burkesville, home of the man who was finally able to stand up to Eddie Vaughn. Fred Capps is buried in the Burkesville Cemetery, in the valley, where a small mountain of flowers is piled over his grave. He is only the third prosecutor in the nation to have been slain by a defendant in the last 20 years. Three thousand people attended his funeral, during which he was repeatedly praised as a hero whose actions may have saved the lives of as many as a dozen others, including the rest of his family. Eddie Vaughn, according to his brother James, had claimed early that final morning that he was determined to kill not only Capps, but also the girl who had accused him of molestation and as many police officers as possible.
A third opinion, perhaps the majority one, is that nothing in Burkesville has essentially changed -- there's still the valley and there's still the hills, there are still assumptions and prejudices and despite the two killings, there are still the same families. Cathi Capps refused to be cast out of her home. Within hours of the shootings, her neighbors had replaced the front door, the porch window and the bedroom carpet, and Cathi and her children slept in the house that same night. She was offered the job of commonwealth's attorney, though she turned it down because of the concerns of her children. The Vaughns also remain in Burkesville, though not all of their own volition. On Aug. 3, a grand jury charged Patricia with complicity to murder and James with the lesser offense of facilitation to murder. During the killings, Patricia never left the car; James wandered into a hayfield behind the Cappses' house. Patricia, who has been unable to post bond and remains in jail, could be sentenced to 20 years to life in prison. James, free on bond, faces a sentence of one to five years. Their trial is scheduled to begin in February in the Cumberland County Courthouse.
And then there's Tommie Vaughn. His father is buried in a small cemetery up in the hills, the site marked with a metallic, helium-filled balloon, from Patricia, that says "I Love You." The only place where Eddie Vaughn's name appears is on an index card, wrapped in plastic and attached to a stake. One hundred and twelve people signed the visitation book at Ballou Funeral Home, several of whom apparently believe that Vaughn's actions were also heroic.
Tommie, who has seemingly inherited much of his father's anger, is now in the process of cultivating Eddie's infamy. "I don't blame my dad for a thing he did," says Vaughn's son. "He worked hard getting his reputation. My dad was a violent person, but he wasn't a child molester. He didn't want to lose his reputation over some false charges. I'm proud of him. He died defending his honor." Tommie says he is soon going to place a larger marker at his father's grave site. He plans to construct it himself, on poster board, and seal it in a waterproof frame. "I'm going to decorate it with an eagle and a flag," he explains, "and then I'm going to write on it, 'Fast Eddie: American Legend."' It's his hope, he says, that the site will become a type of shrine, a meeting place for anyone else in the Cumberland hills who wants to live his life like Eddie Vaughn.

HEADLINE: The Glow of the Past Is Restored

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE; BARBARA CROSSETTE is chief of the United Nations bureau of The Times.

 BODY:
SOMETIMES when the day's work is done, the master maker of cellos and violins settles down on a seat outside his cottage on the main street of Nagyvazsony, a small town in western Hungary, and begins to play. There are few competing sounds to intrude on his music, except for the barking of dogs. Just beyond the treetops, colorful flags rise and fall on the breeze over the watchtower of a castle commanded by a heroic Hungarian patriot who held off the Turkish invaders centuries ago. Has nothing changed here in several hundred years?
In some ways, everything has. 
 A decade after the collapse of Communism, this small Hungarian town and others encountered in neighboring Slovakia are being reborn, both in celebration of new freedoms of choice under democratic governments and in the hope that the best of old central European cultures can be revived. Warm, welcoming, family-run inns offer the comfort and cuisine that were once eclipsed by the austere ugliness and utilitarianism of Socialist hotels -- when any hotel could be found. Gothic and Baroque churches, castles and public squares are being restored to perfection. Family vineyards and all manner of other small enterprises are being expanded and improved. Conversation is no longer constrained by politics.
The moment may not last forever. But for now, in the countryside of central Europe -- unlike in cities such as Budapest and Prague -- the traveler is still a guest, not a victim of rapacious cabdrivers, shopkeepers and hoteliers who sometimes seem to be shamelessly, even belligerently, exploiting the infinite possibilities of uncontrolled capitalism. Village streets are inviting. A mix of languages and lifestyles, with German, Slavic and Hungarian roots, enriches daily life. Old ethnic tensions may one day resurface, too, but for now, there is peace and a joyful sense of renewal.
Our trip in July was a kind of movable family reunion -- 11 Americans from one to three generations away from our roots in these villages, reconnecting with relatives from the extended family left behind by my immigrant mother. We focused on two towns: Nagyvazsony (pronounced Nahzh-VAH-sohn), with a population of 1,700, in the wine-growing region of Hungary about 10 miles north of Lake Balaton; and Kezmarok, in the shadow of the High Tatra mountains of Slovakia, where my mother was born. Some of us had made this pilgrimage, or parts of it, in the past, during some of the darkest years of the 1960's and 1970's. This trip was very different.
Nagyvazsony, two hours west of Budapest's airport by road, is not a developed tourist town. We came because a cousin had a country home there, within striking distance of both the lake and the marvelously restored ancient city of Veszprem with its hilltop palace and churches, a thriving farmers' market and a large pedestrian-only shopping area, with plenty of places to sit and rest or eat.
But even little Nagyvazsony had two recently opened panzio, the Hungarian equivalent of a European pension. Ours, the Malomko -- created by Erika and Tamas Holenyi on the site of what was once a blacksmith's shop -- had a small pool, a restaurant, an outdoor cafe and a patisserie that also sold very good ice cream. In a virtually traffic-free town in midsummer, we could walk along village streets to the 500-year-old fortress of Pal Kinizsi, the legendary warrior with superhuman strength who championed King Matthias and was rewarded with the castle. Much of it is now in ruins, but enough is intact to recreate another age.
Every day in summer, the tale of the indomitable Kinizsi is retold in a performance of medieval swordplay, horsemanship and jousting by a troupe of young people re-enacting the humiliation of the invading Turks -- nowadays, Hungarians in turbans who scale the walls and threaten the defenders from the parapets. The narration is in Hungarian, but not much interpretation is needed as the crowd gleefully cheers on the patriots and boos down the Turks.
A quieter national pride has gone into a small ethnographic museum just a few hundred yards away on Var Street, which leads to the castle compound. The museum is housed in a well-preserved traditional home characteristic of this region, the model for many of Nagyvazsony's present-day houses. Rooms have been restored to show village life over the centuries, down to the elaborate tile stoves that provided winter heat, and still do for many families. In the courtyard on some evenings there is chamber music.
Lake Balaton is an acquired taste. Long one of the most popular tourist destinations in central Europe, Balaton's "beaches," often just grassy lawns leading to a rocky shore, are mobbed in summer. Lakeside towns rattle with the honky-tonk of cheap souvenir stores and fast-food cafes, where hamburgers and pizza create serious competition for the local deep-fried bread specialty, the langos, a plate-size crust topped with almost anything you choose, from garlic to sugar.
An exception was Tihany (pronounced TE-hahnee), a town without a beach, or much public transportation, high on hills along a peninsula that juts out from the lake's northern shore, about 10 miles from Nagyvazsony. The crowning glory of Tihany is its Benedictine abbey, with a lavishly ornamented Baroque church and 11th-century crypt that houses not only the tomb of the founder, King Andrew I, but also a copy of the first official document known to have been written in Hungarian. Around the abbey are several galleries devoted to artifacts from the building's past and contemporary art exhibits. The view of Lake Balaton from the abbey grounds is unparalleled.
If Nagyvazsony was a happy surprise, Kezmarok was a miracle. This town, at the gateway to the High Tatras, a branch of the Carpathian Mountains bridging the Slovakian-Polish border, was settled by Germans from Saxony in the 13th century, brought there by Hungarian rulers to augment the local rural Slovak population against numerous and diverse invaders. The Hungarian king, Stephen V, gave the town and others in the region, called Spis, unusual privileges of self-government and autonomy. These boons lasted almost 600 years.
By the late Middle Ages, local historians say, Kezmarok-- known as Kasemark to its German-speaking inhabitants, who included my ancestors -- was a trade and craft center known for its educational institutions and its artistic and cultural life. In this century, two world wars and authoritarians of the left and right devastated the independent spirit of the town, which now has a population of about 20,000. When I first saw Kezmarok, with my mother before her death more than 20 years ago, it seemed a gloomy place, summer and winter, with dull, gray streets and sooty buildings. I mentally dismissed her stories of what a fine place it had been as exaggerated memories of a happy childhood.
Now it is hard to find a home, church or public building that has not been restored, with old facades repainted in white or one of a palette of colors. Tourists, especially Germans, come to see a unique piece of European history. Architecturally, the town survived mostly intact, from many small private homes to a 15th-century castle, now reopened as a museum. Restaurants, cafes and ice cream parlors further brighten the cobbled streets, where cars are few.
THE Slovak Republic is still a poor agrarian country by European standards. Unemployment is high, we were told, and wages are low. In fact, when I asked where the money for restorations was coming from, several people offered the explanation that labor was cheap and that foreign investors, Austrians in particular, saw the potential for an urban travel boom in towns like these and for eco-tourism in the rich green hills and gentle mountains. Local people welcomed more tourism development for the jobs it could bring.
We found the Hotel Club, near the center of Kezmarok, through the Internet. It was another post-Communist private venture, like our panzio in Hungary. The hotel is owned by the Soltys family and managed by a daughter, Janka, and her husband, Juraj Gantner. Like other small hotels we saw -- the hotel has 50 beds in 19 rooms and suites -- the simple but pleasing furniture was handmade of solid wood. The dining room had a hunting-lodge air about it, with a brick floor, a cast-iron wood stove and so many pelts and trophy antlers of all kinds on every wall that my 7-year-old granddaughter, Emily, felt sad and lost her appetite.
We had traveled to Kezmarok from Budapest on a series of trains -- and one inexplicable bus, linking two stations near the Slovak town of Kosice. Our eastern European rail passes brought us through the Tatra rail center at Poprad all the way to Kezmarok's grand old railway station, also recently refurbished. The hotel was a short walk away, and we didn't need a car again during our stay, except for a trip to visit family graves at Spisska Bela, about five miles away. Even in a steady drizzle, or through a summer shower, everything in Kezmarok was within easy walking distance.
Just behind the Hotel Club was one of the Kezmarok's four notable churches, the Gothic-era Roman Catholic Church of the Holy Cross, with a free-standing Renaissance bell tower beside it. With the Reformation and the Counter-Reformation that followed, Kezmarok felt the pull of religious tensions. An old wooden Protestant church built in the 17th century and the 19th century cathedral-size replacement next door had to be constructed outside the now-destroyed old city walls. But religious dividing lines ebbed and flowed here, with Catholics and Protestants sometimes trading churches as one group or another was in the ascendancy. The little Baroque Paulinus church, built into a row of houses on Castle Square, is on land given as a gift to Catholics during a period in the 17th century when Protestants controlled the town.
Kezmarok's castle, in a rambling walled enclosure near the edge of town, was a local fortress built to safeguard this independent city-state, though as the fortress changed hands and fortunes it once found itself under attack by the townspeople it was built to protect. Many rooms and galleries have been renewed and furnished with period antiques, a process that began under the Communist government in the 1960's and was only recently completed. Exhibitions include fascinating old portraits of citizens of yore, their schools and homes and avocations.
The Hotel Club recommended that we visit the Grandhotel Praha, a magnificently restored turn-of-the-century mountain lodge in Tatranska Lomnica, an hour or so away by car. Tatranska Lomnica, like Stary Smokovec and Strbske Pleso, were the Tatra Mountain equivalents of American and European 19th- and early 20th-century mountain resorts or colonial Asian hill stations. High, cool and health-giving, the towns had sanitariums, resort lodges, hiking trails and sometimes thermal pools.
My son, Jonathan, remembered visiting these towns as a small boy and wanted to go back, so he and his wife, Linda, and their children, Nathan, who is 9, and Emily, detoured with me into the mountains by car for a few days before ending our central European trip with a long train journey to Prague, where we rejoined the rest of the traveling family.
Again, so much was different in the Tatras. Not knowing about the Grandhotel Praha, we had already booked rooms in a brand-new mountain lodge, the Hotel Hubert, in the shadow of the Tatras's highest peak, 8,711-foot Gerlachovsky. A big hotel set in a sweeping meadow ringed by dense spruce forests, the Hubert had all kinds of diversions for children, from ponies to skittles to a heated indoor pool. The coffeehouse had great ice cream.
But the Hubert will never be the equal of the Grandhotel Praha, where we spent a day. Nor will it match another restoration in progress, the Grand Hotel in Stary Smokovec, set to reopen by the end of the year. These are magnificent turn-of-the-century buildings full of splendors of a gilded age, from deep leather chairs by the fire to chandeliered dining rooms where even the smallest diners are treated royally.
Tatranska Lomnica serves as headquarters of the Tatra National Park, known as Tanap, which was established more than half a century ago and recently expanded. There is an excellent small museum here that provides an easy-to-follow introduction to the mountains, their plants and animals and their people. Nearby, a nature garden has taken shape to display the granite and limestone that form the Tatras, along with fossils, mosses and other vegetation.
From the Grandhotel Praha, between a morning coffee and a long, late lunch, we climbed nearly 1,000 feet and at least a mile up into the mountains along hiking trails softened by carpets of needles from the towering evergreens that cover the Tatras's lower reaches. Then, at a place called Start, at about 3,800 feet, we caught a ski lift to the glacial lake at Skalnate, above the tree line at about 5,700 feet. It was a breathtaking ride. Had the weather been clearer, we might have been tempted to go to the top of Lomnica, an 8,635-foot peak, and the lift's last stop. Instead, we rode back down to Tatranska Lomnica and hiked back to the warmth of the Grandhotel Praha.
At last, in these mountains, lost in trees, we were back to a recognizable place. Tourism in central Europe is undergoing a revolution in many ways. But nothing in this glorious natural landscape had changed. Slovakia has decided some things can't really be improved, and should certainly not be commercialized. A new guidebook to the Tatra National Park museum at Tatranska Lomnica asks a little plaintively, "How are we doing?" Just great.
 
Exploring small towns in Eastern Europe
United States citizens require only a valid passport to enter Slovakia; for Hungary, the passport must be valid for six months past the entry date.
 
Transportation
A rental car is a popular way to travel in central Europe, and roads are good and well marked. But because we were a large group with a lot to talk about, we made most journeys by rail with a European East Pass, which can be used in Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia. A first-class pass good for five days within any 30-day period cost $205 for adults, with extra days $23 each. Passes must be bought outside the countries where they will be used; they are sold in the United States by Rail Europe, (800) 438-7245 or www.raileurope.com.
Passes must be validated at a train station on the day travel begins, and dates must be entered for each subsequent journey before boarding a train. Reservations, for an additional few dollars, are often required on express trains. Railway clerks or conductors seldom spoke any foreign language. In Slovakia, we asked an English-speaking hotel receptionist to write out in Slovak what reservations we wanted, and we took this to the station to book seats several days before the next trip.
Trains were best in Slovakia and the Czech Republic. The most disappointing ride, about five hours long, was in a very dirty Hungarian train with no food services from Budapest to the eastern city of Miskolc, where we were loaded into buses to be deposited at the Slovak border more than an hour later and put on another train to the Slovak city of Kosice. The express train from Kosice to Poprad, the rail center of the Tatra region, and on to Prague was superb, with delightful scenery. There was a dining car, though the food was poor and the selection limited.
Taxis and car rentals are available in larger cities and towns where tourists visit, though Kezmarok and Nagyvazsony did not have car rentals. In the Tatras, several taxi services operate, some using meters but others preferring to negotiate prices in advance. The 35-minute trip from Kezmarok to the Hotel Hubert in Gerlachov, for example, cost about $20 (at 51.48 koruna to the dollar). From the Hubert we used metered taxis to Stary Smokovec (about $10) and Tatranska Lomnica, which cost $12 to $14. Two local train lines connect the mountain towns to each other and to Poprad. The nearest train stop to the Hubert is Tatranska Polianka, about a 15-minute walk uphill.
In Hungary, we had a private van with driver arranged by relatives in Nagyvazsony. The owner-driver charged us $400 for four days (at 313 forints to the dollar). Renting a van with driver in Budapest would have cost more. International car rental companies can provide this service if you make reservations.
 
Lodging and Dining
The Malomko Panzio, on Kinizsi Street in Nagyvazsony, telephone and fax (36-88) 264-165, had about a dozen rooms that could be configured in various ways. Double accommodation with private bath costs $25. A suite sleeping four was $50. Rates included a copious buffet breakfast. Other meals were very cheap, with a main course of paprika chicken or goulash and noodles for $2.
Our meals in the Nagyvazsony area were never equaled anywhere else for quality or value. One evening, about 16 of us dined out in a small private vineyard with picnic tables under the trees, on schnitzels and other local dishes, washed down by carafes of wine and topped by Hungarian crepes called palacsinta -- all for less than $50. These vineyards do not normally advertise (our dinner was organized by relatives who knew the vineyard owner), but local innkeepers can arrange wine tastings with snacks or full meals at a number of places. The region's wines tend to be light, rieslings and chardonnays.
In Kezmarok, the Hotel Club, at 24 Mudr. Alexander, telephone (421-968) 452 4051, fax (421-968) 452 4053, charges $34 for a double room and bath, including buffet breakfast, in high season and $26 in low season. The hotel dining room serves good local food, including cheese-filled pirogies, mixed grills and dumplings, all in the $4 to $6 range, including a glass of local beer.
Kezmarok also has several good restaurants, among them The Three Apostles, on 9 Hlavne Namestie, near the Town Hall; telephone (421-968) 452 3272, fax (421-968) 452 5725. Prices are similar.
In general, food in small-town Slovakia relied more on pork than veal or beef, which is more widely available in Hungary. Slovakian schnitzel was also sometimes made of tenderized chicken.
The Hotel Hubert, near Gerlachov, (421-969) 442 5262, fax (421-969) 442 2734, www.tanap.sk/hubert/, charges $69 for a double with bath and balcony with panoramic views, breakfast included. Meals, with the usual fare, were a little disappointing here, and cost more, though were still far from expensive. A dinner for three adults and two children cost about $43 with drinks.
In Tatranska Lomnica, the restored Grandhotel Praha, (421-969) 446 7941, fax (421-969) 446 7891, has double rooms for $41 in summer and $59 in ski season. A generous lunch for five with drinks cost $36.
 
Language
An ability to speak some German -- for those who do not speak Hungarian or Slovak -- is useful and sometimes a necessity in small central European towns. But young people are learning English in school, and most Slovak hotels in particular seemed to have someone on the staff who could speak it. Rail employees and other government workers were the least multilingual as well as the least helpful.
In villages and towns, however, there is little chance of getting lost. Good maps are available from inns and hotels, streets are well marked, as are mountain trails, and townspeople want to be helpful when they can. Ask a hotel to establish taxi rates and write down directions you may need. In the Tatras, mountain towns usually have a central bus-taxi and sometimes cable-car station grouped together, along with a cafe or at least a kiosk for snacks and a money-changer. Bigger towns, including Kezmarok and Stary Smokovec, have A.T.M.'s. BARBARA CROSSETTE

HEADLINE: ART/ARCHITECTURE;
Reading a Civilization Through Its Ancient Shards

BYLINE: By DEBORAH WEISGALL; Deborah Weisgall writes about the arts from Boston.

DATELINE: WORCESTER, Mass.

 BODY:
ENTERING the Worcester Art Museum, the first thing a visitor sees is a sixth-century late Roman mosaic, more than 20 feet square, set into the floor of the entrance hall. In it hunters pursue lions, tigers, bear, antelope. A youth on horseback snatches a tiger cub from its snarling mother. Fruit trees, flowers and vignettes of landscapes relieve the carnage, and in the center, a hunter, weary and victorious, crosses his legs and leans against his spear, which pierces the throat of a wild boar.
This spectacular and brutal scene paved the floor of a private house in Antioch, founded in 300 B.C. and one of the great cities of the classical world. Today ancient Antioch lies beneath the modern Turkish city of Antakya, near the Syrian border at the northeast elbow of the Mediterranean. The mosaic, along with other equally stunning and tantalizing glimmers of an almost mythical place, arrived in Worcester nearly 60 years ago. Now, an important exhibition, organized by Christine Kondoleon, the curator of Greek and Roman art at the museum, places these works of art in their archaeological and historical context for the first time. 
 "Antioch: The Lost Ancient City," which remains on view until Feb. 4, when it travels to Cleveland and Baltimore, recreates the splendor of what was one of the four great cities of the Roman empire. Four silver-gilt tyches on display -- female deities personifying the good fortune of a particular city -- representing Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria and Antioch attest to Antioch's status. Sculptures, mosaics, jewelry and intriguing inscriptions, most of them from the second to the sixth centuries A.D., bring to life a complex metropolis that thrived in an era whose economic, political and spiritual circumstances were in many ways similar to our own. It was a time when the Roman Empire's dominion over the diverse civilizations bordering the Mediterranean led to unprecedented prosperity and spiritual hunger.
Until the 1930's, Antioch's remains were almost entirely literary; its physical glories had been obliterated by earthquakes, floods and invasions from the east. Ancient philosophers and historians extolled the city's cosmopolitan, tolerant atmosphere of luxury and learning; by Roman times it had supplanted Athens as the center of Greek intellectual life.
It was in Antioch that followers of a new mystery cult were first called Christians. For nearly a decade, St. Paul used the city as a base of operations for missionary work, and many scholars believe that Matthew wrote his gospel there. According to Josephus, the first century Jewish historian, Jews numbered among the city's original settlers.
In 1932, a consortium including the Worcester Art Museum, Princeton University, the Louvre and the Baltimore Museum of Art sponsored a series of archaeological expeditions to unearth Antioch's treasures and monuments. But the expedition's leaders and its sponsors were badly disappointed. They discovered no palaces, no golden cathedrals. Most of what they dug up under tons of silt were houses. Their walls were almost always demolished, but their floors survived, adorned with more than 300 mosaics. In 1939, the sponsoring institutions divided the spoils (more than half remained in Antakya), often splitting up the floors from a single room. Excavation pits were filled, olive groves replanted and the ancient city was lost again.
Since then, however, as the study of history has focused as much on ordinary citizens as on their leaders, attention has shifted from throne rooms to dining rooms. Only 10 percent of Antioch's population was rich, according to the fourth-century pagan philosopher Libanios, and only 10 percent was poor. The remaining 80 percent lived remarkably well, and at its height, Antioch's population numbered more than 400,000 citizens and freedmen, not counting women, children and slaves. The exhibition focuses on their dining rooms, or triclinia, in order to recreate the city's great middle-class era, and for middle-class America at the beginning of the third millennium, those ancient houses reveal a familiar ostentation.
"Antioch: The Lost Ancient City" reunites many of the artifacts and objects excavated by the expedition, including some of the most beautiful mosaics. During the five years of preparations for this show, scholars examined for the first time in decades some of the material from the excavations that had been in storage, and the show's catalog presents much of their new research.
Related objects from ancient Syria, including bronzes and glass and silver vessels, fill in many gaps in the city's archaeological record. Such artifacts are rare, and some new finds don't survive their discovery. For instance, mosaics like those at Antioch, unearthed last summer at Zeugma farther west along the Turkish coast, will soon be flooded by water backing up behind a new dam.
Antioch marked the crossroads of trade routes between Persia and the Far East, Egypt and Rome. Founded by one of Alexander the Great's generals, Seleukos I, who named the city after his son and successor, Antiochus I, it quickly became an oasis of Hellenic culture in the Semitic Near East and remained so even after its conquest by Rome.
Although Greek remained Antioch's lingua franca, Rome imposed its shell of administration and customs: Emperors built public baths (several were found) and boulevards; they introduced gladiatorial combat and staged wild animal hunts (the Worcester Hunt mosaic could have derived from those bloody entertainments). Antioch's middle class took full advantage of the economic and cultural efficiencies of empire; their houses and furnishings resembled those built in Pompeii or Carthage. By and large, rulers countenanced any religion as long as it did not interfere with civic pagan ritual; the elite adapted Roman customs, displayed Roman gods beside their own and celebrated dinner as the social and intellectual high point of the day.
During the centuries of the Roman peace, Antioch flourished; its baths and wide arcaded streets were theaters where strangers -- Romans, Syrians, Jews, Christians, Persians, Greeks -- mingled and learned from one another. Its dining rooms set a more intimate stage upon which to continue the dialogue.
Ms. Kondoleon has structured the exhibition as a kind of dialogue as well. Overlapping themes -- water, entertainment, the Roman house, religions -- illuminate different aspects of Antioch's civic character.
The city's pivotal geography proved the source of both its vitality and its vulnerability. Persian emperors of the Sasanian dynasty coveted Antioch, sacked it twice -- in A.D. 256 and 540 -- and incorporated the phrase "better than Antioch" into the names of the cities they built closer to home. Sasanian stylized art, using birds and animals in patterned design -- a mosaic border of ram's heads, for instance -- found its way into Antioch's houses.
Most of the mosaics, however, employ realistic imagery. In a gallery constructed to evoke a dining room in the Atrium House excavated at Antioch, the arrangement of mosaic panels, reassembled from Paris, Baltimore, Princeton and Wellesley, defines the placement of furniture. Three couches, or clinia (hence triclinium, the Roman name for dining room) would have been arranged on a U-shaped geometric mosaic border surrounding pictorial panels arranged in a T. Guests entering the room would have walked on a panel illustrating a drinking contest between Dionysius and Hercules, flanked on either side by a dancing maenad and satyr. Reclining on their couches, diners could contemplate a Judgment of Paris, then Aphrodite and Adonis enthroned. Through a portico, they could glimpse a fountain with marble statues displayed in its niches.
If some of the domestic sculpture tends to be modest, the mosaics in Worcester flicker with life. Paris, surrounded by his flock of cows and goats, looks to Hermes for advice, while the three goddesses, glowering with almost comical impatience and competitive fury, await his decision. And if a silver ewer and plate excavated in a neighboring suburb are not the most elaborate Roman serving pieces ever found, they are nevertheless quite elegant. An intricate golden arm band set with emeralds and sapphires is hardly understated. Life in Antioch was good.
One delight of the show is that it offers, as Ms. Kondoleon says, "the big picture of life in the city as well providing intimate glimpses into the very personal." A rolled curse tablet contains an inscription begging a demon to "bind" a grocer named Babylas, to "sink him like lead" and destroy his house and animals. A gold ring is engraved with its wearer's horoscope; another ring bears the names of two men who were friends and correspondents of the philosopher Libanios.
Did these men reflect aloud on the hubris of trying to best a god as they chugged wine from rhytons like the one Hercules is draining in the mosaic at their feet? Did they discuss with Hellenic detachment John Chrysostom's diatribe against Jews as Christ-killers? Did they admit to having buried a curse tablet in a city well? Although magic was a crime in the Roman Empire, it was also as common as jaywalking is today.
Probably they discussed religion. The Pax Romana, of course, has found its modern parallel in the Pax Americana, in the worldwide exportation of American culture. Ideas, art, politics and religions circulate, blend and clash. The yearning for a spiritual haven was perhaps even more urgent in Roman Antioch than it is today. Independent finds, like the Antioch Chalice, an elaborately decorated fourth-century cup loaned by the Cloisters in New York, attest to the richness of the early church and to its profound allure.
The expeditions of the 1930's dug up no pagan temples or synagogues, but they did uncover in Antioch's port remnants of a church whose ambulatory was paved with a mosaic of animals and birds. Elephants, flamingos, zebras, gazelles, peacocks, a lioness and her cubs: all creation circled the church in a docile parade. In this floor, pagan entertainment translated into a vision from Genesis: the bloody staged hunt has been converted to a peaceable kingdom.

HEADLINE: FILM;
How the First World War Changed Movies Forever

BYLINE: By STUART KLAWANS; Stuart Klawans is the author of "Film Follies: The Cinema Out of Order."

 BODY:
I WAS face to face with the awful reality," the French filmmaker Marcel L'Herbier used to say of World War I, despite his never having come near the trenches. Posted to the Army Cinematographic Service, the young L'Herbier spent his war in Paris. Yet each day at work he found his life "turned upside down," just as surely as if he had been in battle.
"Everything that was filmed at the front passed through our hands," he recalled. "We cut, we spliced, we chose what could be shown. I watched scenes of horror; I saw soldiers who had been eviscerated, cut in two, decapitated. That shock revealed to me that I had to become a filmmaker." 
 As these memories reminds us, the Great War was the first to be fought before the motion picture camera. In the field, reconnaisance became airborne and cinematic; at home, propaganda leapt from the page to the screen. The effects were so far-reaching, argues Paul Virilio in his often-cited book "War and Cinema," that the war zone itself may be thought of as a kind of film. On the front, perceptions became accelerated, discontinuous, mechanized, as if the soldiers' eyes had turned into cameras. From this condition, there was to be no release; after 1918, cinema's shock techniques continued wartime perception by other means.
I summarize this theory with caution, since Mr. Virilio develops it through that mixture of hyperbole and non sequitur which is French scholarship at its zaniest. But grant him this much: If a thoroughgoing aesthete like L'Herbier could be so altered by the war, then whose life wasn't turned upside down? World War I, which changed everything, had film as one of its main tools of transformation.
The war also changed the conditions of filmmaking, in France, Germany, Russia and the United States. To a remarkable degree, today's film industry retains the shape it was given by the war -- which means that every picture we see is in some sense a World War I movie.
For French cinema, the war was a debacle. Before 1914, the Pathe and Gaumont companies had enjoyed commanding positions throughout the world. After the war, these two giants all but ceased production, and French cinema became (by and large) the work of small, quasi-artisanal companies, perpetually struggling to reach markets outside their borders.
Yet French film could still attempt great things, as a World War I epic soon proved. Abel Gance solidified his reputation and revived the industry's hopes with "J'Accuse" (1919), the story of a frail poet who goes off to the front and comes home, shellshocked, to a village of widows and grieving mothers. For the last of the several accusations he hurls, the poet calls up the specters of the dead, who troop back from their graves by the thousands.
Gance first released this picture in a version that was as long as three normal features; in 1922, he brought out a shortened version, which ran only three hours and was altered in meaning. The original was generally understood as an outcry against the war. In the 1922 version, nationalist fervor resurfaced: Gance trimmed his battle sequences and added a victory parade.
If he was now leveling his accusation exclusively against German militarism, perhaps one reason was the rise of the German film industry. In cinema, at least, the war's losers had come out far ahead of the winners.
The preparation for this triumph was made in 1917, when the German supreme command initiated the consolidation of the film industry, so that cinema might be "put to work with the highest priority." The result was UFA, a company that did little for the war effort (despite such productions as "Anna Makes Artillery Shells") but that after the war grew to be the biggest and most technically advanced studio in the world.
Comedies, romances, fantasies, historical spectacles and chamber dramas poured out of UFA in the 1920's. But for the most part, World War I went unaddressed until 1927, when the studio fell into the hands of Alfred Hugenberg, an industrialist, publisher and early supporter of Hitler. Suddenly, UFA was bringing out Leo Lasko's two-part "The World War," a film that was deemed suitable for showing to a paramilitary organization.
It's not surprising, then, that the great German film about World War I, G. W. Pabst's "Westfront 1918," was made not for UFA but for the smaller, independent Nero-Film. The story of the lives and deaths of four representative German soldiers, "Westfront 1918" came out in 1930, the same year that Universal released Lewis Milestone's "All Quiet on the Western Front," and was favorably compared to its American competitor. Pabst had made a far tougher film -- so tough, in fact, that the most gruesome sequences are now missing from all prints.
On the Eastern Front, the war's effect on cinema was decisive, since there could have been no Soviet film without a Soviet Union, and no Soviet Union without the war. This interrelationship is plain to see in "The End of St. Petersburg" (1927), a film commissioned for the 10th anniversary of the Bolshevik revolution, in which Vsevolod Pudovkin makes his Great War scenes flash across the screen like blasts from a flamethrower.
The experience of disorientation that's key to Mr. Virilio's theory -- the soldier's sense of being hurtled through abrupt changes in landscape, as seen from strange and shifting viewpoints -- finds stunning formal expression here and in the works of the other great innovators of Soviet film. This visual violence is meant to stimulate the mind as much as the eye. To suggest the causes of the war -- a subject that filmmakers in other nations generally avoided -- Pudovkin contrasts his soldiers' doomed charge across no man's land with the frenzied rush of stock traders on the home front, as they shove their way toward war profits.
The great victor of World War I in cinema, as in all else, was, of course, the United States. Alone among the combatants, America emerged with its society and economy intact. One immediate consequence was Hollywood's domination of screens around the world. It took over the markets from which France had withdrawn; it hired away (or provided refuge to) the best talent that UFA developed. When you hear studio executives today claim that Hollywood succeeds simply by giving people what they want, maybe you'll want to think of these names: Ypres, Verdun, Passchendaele.
American filmmakers ventured into this territory even before the fighting was done. In 1917, D. W. Griffith went to the front, having received the encouragement of Lloyd George to make a picture for the war effort. (It says a lot about the state of the British film industry that this request should have gone to an American.) But the director of indelible Civil War battle scenes found that trench warfare wasn't what he'd expected. He retired to encampments in the English countryside, to make "Hearts of the World." It was not his best work. Charles Chaplin did better with his classic "Shoulder Arms" (1918), a picture about the victories that the Little Tramp dreams up for himself while slogging about in the trenches.
The full potential of World War I as a Hollywood subject did not become apparent until 1925, with the making of "The Big Parade," produced by Irving Thalberg and directed by King Vidor. The story of a bland young fool who is caught up in patriotic fervor, only to return home maimed and disillusioned but also deepened in spirit, the picture established John Gilbert as a star and gave the newly formed MGM studio its first big hit. With the coming of sound, however, the picture's fame was eclipsed by that of "All Quiet on the Western Front," which isn't a bad movie if you accept the conventions of a previous era's acting style and stick your fingers in your ears during Maxwell Anderson's speeches. But "The Big Parade" needs no apologies. Both exhilarating and sobering in the best Hollywood manner, it conveys meaning through the sheer scale that's possible in moviemaking. Panoramic spectacles evoke the awesome power of the war; the attractive but loosely drawn protagonist comes to represent the entire World War I generation.
Among the notable movies that followed was the winner of the first Academy Award for best motion picture: the 1927 Air Service drama "Wings," directed by William Wellman, a much-decorated flier in the war. Special mention should also be made of "The Dawn Patrol" (1930), the first of several World War I pictures by another flying director, Howard Hawks. Although he was later nominated for an Oscar for "Sergeant York" (1941), Hawks took particular pride in this earlier aviation feature because of its terse dialogue and restrained acting -- qualities that hadn't been much in evidence in the early talkies, and were surely appropriate to this subject.
But it was a French veteran of the air war who made what is surely the greatest World War I movie -- and he did it without filming a single battle scene. In "Grand Illusion" (1937), Jean Renoir brought out the meanings of World War I as no one else had, by dramatizing the journey of French soldiers through prisoner-of-war camps and out into the German countryside. In traversing a series of credible yet symbolic places (industrial barracks, a feudal castle, an idyllic farmhouse), the wonderfully individualized yet highly representative soldiers leave behind the class-bound Europe that the war had destroyed. They end their journey, by implication, on the verge of the next stage in destruction: World War II.
"Grand Illusion" proved to be a career high point for all of its actors, including Jean Gabin (who wore Renoir's own uniform as his costume). But for Erich von Stroheim, the film was an apotheosis. He had made his name in D. W. Griffith's Hollywood by impersonating the cold, brutal Hun, both on screen and off. Reprising that character in "Grand Illusion," he received from Renoir what he had never been able to give himself: nobility.
From here, the World War I movie underwent a steep falling off. World War II supplanted the First World War as a subject, and the few filmmakers who went back to the earlier period seemed to have lost touch with its meaning. (Witness the Technicolor flapdoodle that John Ford made out of "What Price Glory?" in 1952.) I think there's been only one first-rate film made about the First World War since "Grand Illusion": Stanley Kubrick's "Paths of Glory" in 1957.
Here you do see battle, as no soldier ever experienced it: smoothly, continuously, from above. This clarity of vision may be the film's most terrifying irony -- irony, of course, being the mode most appropriate to artworks about World War I, as Paul Fussell wrote in his study "The Great War and Modern Memory." For Kubrick, the war provided an opportunity to explore the gap between the way people plan (including the justifications they give for their decisions) and the way they behave, as planning meets circumstance. Only one area of life could be held immune from the tricks of happenstance: his own work. In "Paths of Glory," he gave us human disaster, impeccably realized.
Since then, a mere handful of films have returned to the war as their primary setting. Some have been grand (David Lean's "Lawrence of Arabia," 1962), some good (Bertrand Tavernier's "Life and Nothing But," 1989) and others neither (Peter Weir's 1981 "Gallipoli"). Maybe this drop-off in numbers and quality is to be expected. Sentimentalities about "the greatest generation" now seem to mark the horizon of our historical imagination.
But then, out of nowhere, comes "Time Regained" (1999), Raul Ruiz's meditation on Proust's "Remembrance of Things Past," and we once more feel the shock that L'Herbier experienced. Early in the film, at a moment set in the Belle Epoque, young Marcel watches a magic lantern show about chivalric adventures. Then, without transition, he encounters a soldier of World War I -- Robert de Saint-Loup -- who is gazing through an eyepiece. We see what Saint-Loup sees: black-and-white footage of a wounded horse, struggling in a trench.
These images are not suitable for you, says Saint-Loup. Too late. From chivalry and magic lantern shows to trench warfare and cinema: we've made the transition, and we live with it.

Windfalls In Tax and Water Bills

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
FEW people would idly sit by if their banks failed to credit the interest due on savings accounts. And few people would hesitate to protest if items rung up by supermarket cashiers exceeded the correct sales prices.
As it turns out, however, owners of large residential properties in New York City -- including some co-op buildings -- may be losing thousands of dollars in unused or misapplied tax credits and inadvertent overpayments on water bills. 
 "There seems to be a significant amount of money out there in unused tax credits and water bill overpayments that owners of large buildings are just not aware they are entitled to," said Herb Rose, a Manhattan co-op consultant.
Mr. Rose emphasized that city officials are under no obligation to uncover unused tax credits and overpayments on water bills. Rather, he said, it is typically the property owner's responsibility to ensure that credits are received and that bills are not overpaid.
"In most cases, the reason money hasn't been returned is because the property owner has never made any effort to get it back," Mr. Rose said. He noted that the division of responsibility between a building's board and its managing agent may also explain why some money is not found.
He pointed out that while ferreting out unused credits and water bill overpayments requires the assistance of experts, the amount of money at stake can sometimes be stunning.
"The first board I referred out for this got a return of more than $700,000," he said. "They were flabbergasted."
Irwin Strauss, president of a Brooklyn real estate consulting firm bearing his name, is one of the specialists Mr. Rose was referring to.
"My strength is my ability to determine if anything is wrong with a building's property taxes," Mr. Strauss said. "The majority of my work is trying to find lost tax abatements and tax exemptions and then bringing that money back to the client."
Like other consultants who perform similar services, Mr. Strauss works on a contingency-fee basis; that is, clients pay him only if he is able to get them some money.
"Most of the time we work on a contingency of 25 to 33 percent of what we collect," Mr. Strauss said. "And most of the time, our clients were not even aware they had any money coming to them."
One of the most fertile fields for consultants like Mr. Strauss is the rather arcane area of J-51 tax abatements. Such abatements, he said, are granted by the city when the owner of a multiple dwelling performs certain repairs or capital improvements. For example, Mr. Strauss said, if a property owner -- including a co-op -- installs $100,000 worth of new windows, the property owner may be entitled to recoup 90 percent or more of the money spent in the form of tax abatements spread out over a period of 12 years or so.
There are times, however, when an abatement may legitimately be revoked by the city. For example, he said, if a property owner fails to pay all or a portion of the property taxes that are due on a building and the arrearage is carried on the city's books for more than a year, J-51 abatements can be revoked.
"You don't even have to have the entire tax bill outstanding to have your abatement revoked," he said.
At the same time, however, the abatement can be reinstated, in some cases retroactively, once the late taxes are paid.
"When the taxes are caught up, the city doesn't automatically reinstate the J-51 abatement," Mr. Strauss said. "It's up to the property owner to make sure it gets done."
And in some cases, he said, failure to do so can be a costly mistake.
"In a large building, a J-51 abatement can mean a lot of money," Mr. Strauss said. "I have two co-ops right now that are getting back six-figure tax credits."
Another area in which property owners may lose money without being aware of it involves tax credits due under the Senior Citizens Rent Increase Exemption Program -- commonly referred to as Scrie (pronounced scree). Under that program, Mr. Strauss said, elderly residents who meet certain age and income requirements (generally, those who are 62 or older and have yearly household incomes of less than $20,000) are exempt from rent increases. Any increases that the property owner would be entitled to, he said, are instead paid by the city in the form of property tax credits.
In many cases, however, property owners with tenants eligible for Scrie benefits lose track of the benefits they are entitled to while still foregoing rent increases for tenants who -- for one reason or another -- no longer participate in the Scrie program. Indeed, Mr. Strauss said, it is generally up to the property owner to ensure that eligible tenants reapply for benefits -- as required by law -- with each lease renewal.
"If the tenant doesn't file the renewal, the city doesn't issue the credit, and the landlord may never be aware of it," he said.
Another way property owners -- including co-op and condominium boards -- can lose money in their buildings is by overpaying for water and sewer use.
Gerald Hirsch, the owner of Gerald Hirsch Water Management, a consulting firm in Brooklyn, said property owners sometimes pay more than they should for water and sewage charges because of the different methods the city uses to calculate such charges.
Mr. Hirsch explained that traditionally water charges in the city have been calculated using the "frontage" method, which uses such factors as the size of the property, the number of units and the number of water-using fixtures to arrive at an annual charge for water and sewage use.
In recent years, however, the city has stepped up efforts to get all buildings on a metered billing basis and has allowed buildings that install meters to remain on frontage billing for a period of time.
In some cases, Mr. Hirsch said, buildings that have had meters installed are still being billed on a frontage basis even though it would be less expensive to switch to metered billing. At the same time, he said, there may be some buildings in which it would be more economical to stay on frontage billing for as long as possible.
"From a management perspective, it is useful to evaluate the most economical method of billing," Mr. Hirsch said.
Alan Rothschild, president of Vantage Group, a water cost management company in Monroe Township, N.J., agreed. "I have a building I'm working with now that has had a meter for five years and has paid $50,000 more for frontage charges than they would have paid if they were on metered billing," he said.
Mr. Rothschild said that in addition to scouring old water bills to determine whether a building owner is paying more than necessary for water and sewage charges, his company will also perform a physical survey of the building to identify existing water-related problems.
"The most common and expensive water-related problem is unreported toilet leaks," he said. "It may not seem like much, but in a large building a bunch of leaking toilets can end up costing a property owner tens of thousands of dollars every year."

HEADLINE: A Walkway Filled With Words and Images of Connecticut's Past

BYLINE: By ALBERTA EISEMAN

 BODY:
THE crew of a whaling ship in New London harbor, circa 1907; a smiling young Algonquian man, portrayed in 1645; munitions workers during World War II; a Yankee peddler in his horse-drawn wagon; the legendary Charter Oak -- these are some of the images, well known or unfamiliar, chosen to tell the story of Connecticut in an exhibition mounted along the walkway between the Capitol and the Legislative Office Building in Hartford.
The 25 historical images, collectively entitled "Imagining Connecticut," set the scene for a group of interconnected programs designed to introduce the state's history to the thousands of residents and tourists who visit the two adjoining structures: the grand, gold-domed Victorian Capitol and the sleek office building dedicated in 1988. 
 "The whole story of Connecticut is not found anywhere else in the state, and this is one of our great public spaces," said Bruce Fraser, executive director of the Connecticut Humanities Council, which produced and financed the project with the support and assistance of the Joint Committee on Legislative Management.
"People come here to visit, to attend meetings, to lobby their representatives: little kids, seniors, casual visitors with little understanding of Connecticut and people who spend a great deal of time here and are intimately connected to the process. We wanted to reach them all, so we needed to set up a series of programs that would satisfy the varied audiences," he said.
Nothing was left to chance. To create "Imagining Connecticut," Mr. Fraser gathered together a panel of historians who hammered out the themes for the display.
"What essential 15 or 20 things do we want people to appreciate about our distinct past?" Mr. Fraser asked at their first meeting. "What images best capture these points and tell us who we are?"
And so the viewer is presented with an early painting of the three churches on New Haven's town green, a choice intended to emphasize the importance of the state's strict religious origins; a daguerreotype of workers at the Eli Terry Clock Factory, which pays homage to Connecticut's inventors and their key role in the industrial revolution. Mark Twain and his neighbor, Harriet Beecher Stowe, represent the state's cultural heritage; a portrait of James Mars -- a little known, but noteworthy former slave who led a movement to extend voting rights to African-Americans -- reminds visitors that the struggle for equal representation was long and hard, and that slavery was not abolished in the state until 1848.
The most ambitious component of the project, on view in the atrium of the Legislative Office Building, is an eight-panel, 500 square foot, permanent exhibition on the history of self-government in Connecticut, whose title, "An Orderly and Decent Government," is a quotation from the Fundamental Orders, drawn up in 1639 by early colonists.
"To mayntayne the peace and union for such a people there should be an orderly and decent Government established," wrote the doughty Puritans. They also proclaimed the radical ideas that the authority of government came from the "free consent" of those governed and that "representation," or letting the people choose their own leaders, was the way to make government work.
"Their handiwork," the exhibition states, "was the world's first document putting in practice the principles of self-government" -- in other words, the basis for Connecticut's claim to the title "Constitution State," an assertion some scholars find debatable.
Dense with pictures and text, the exhibition presents the history of the state in detail and shows the influence of the general assembly on it. Each panel is divided into three concurrent tracks. The upper third presents major trends and developments at the national and state level -- wars, migrations, economic and political upheavals -- and how they shaped the period under consideration. The middle track, "Searching for the Common Good," explores the major issues created by these forces, and how the legislature addressed them. At the bottom, "Making Self-government Work," traces the story of the legislature itself as it evolved over time, from a single legislative chamber to the complex institution of today, from a gathering of white, male property owners to the diverse House of Representatives and Senate of our time.
Unhurried visitors will be rewarded with dozens of intriguing episodes: the religious controversies of the 1740's, for example, as Anglicans, Quakers, Baptists and other groups entered the colony and pressured the General Assembly to recognize their religious practices; or, after statehood, the westward migration of thousands of the state's people in search of fertile land -- 750,000 men and women left Connecticut between the years 1760 and 1840; the exploits of the "privateers," privately owned vessels authorized by the state to attack British ships during the War of 1812, or the rise of the "Know-Nothing" party, which took control of the General Assembly in 1855 and quickly passed a tough anti-Irish, anti-Catholic program.
No effort is made to gloss over the less appealing aspects of Connecticut's heritage.
"What we worked hard on in this exhibition is trying to tell the truth," Mr. Fraser said.
History buffs and other visitors who want to learn more about a particular topic can turn to "History on Demand," an interactive video station located between the two exhibitions. The station offers 15 brief vignettes on such issues as the Fundamental Orders, the legend of the Charter Oak, the clash between Yankees and immigrants or the struggle of women to win the vote.
A handsome, short brochure on the history of the General Assembly and of the state is available as part of this multi-faceted program. Moreover, a collection of resource materials and teacher guides is being readied for fall distribution, so that tomorrow's voters can better understand the heritage of Connecticut.
The Capitol and the Legislative Office Building are open to the public Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Tours of the two buildings are offered by the League of Women Voters at quarter after the hour from 9:15 a.m. to 2:15 p.m., free of charge. Tour information is available by calling (860) 240-0222.

HEADLINE: Safety and Zoning vs. Freedom of Religion

BYLINE: By ALICE SPARBERG ALEXIOU

DATELINE: NORTH AMITYVILLE

 BODY:
THEY have names like The Revelation Church of God in Christ, Ephesus Church and Living Waters Evangelistic. They are scattered about North Amityville like seeds sown by the wind. They range from structures originally built as houses of worship to storefronts to converted houses in residential areas.
Their numbers are increasing, with Town of Babylon officials estimating the total at about 40 in North Amityville, an unincorporated hamlet of about 16,000. They also exist in nearby Wyandanch. Wherever they are, the neighbors who wake up one morning to find that they are living next to a church often find it anything but a blessing. 
 Peter Casserly, Babylon's commissioner of planning and development, said that neighbors often called the town to complain of increased traffic and noise, often in the form of amplified music during religious services. Some churches stand for years in an uncompleted state. Living Waters Evangelistic, for example, at 335 North Albany Avenue, began construction in 1994. Today it consists of a steel skeleton surrounded by piles of plastic-covered cinderblock.
Having a church next door, said Milton Bond, president of the North Amityville Taxpayers Association, has a negative effect on property values, which residents and local officials are striving to boost as the community recovers from a crime wave that created havoc in the 1980's.
For the past four years, some residents have been working closely with the Town of Babylon to stem the tide through enforcement of zoning and fire codes. One church has been shut down and dozens of code citations have been issued.
But the churches have members, and some of them oppose the crackdown. And beyond the sensitivity of the attempt to regulate the exercise of religious beliefs, a racial overtone has crept into the debate, pitting some black congregations against white town officials.
"I don't think the town should have taken the position that they did," said the Rev. Carrie Wilson, whose New Life Christian Ministries is the only church to have been shut down for code violations. "There are at least 25 or 30 other churches in houses, and they didn't close them down! So why did they get an injunction for New Life Church?
"I asked Gil Hanse, the town's fire marshal, 'Can't you be compassionate enough to allow us to continue to worship here as we continue to work through the things we need in order to comply?' But he said he didn't think I could bring it up to code."
Mr. Hanse acknowledged that "it's a hard thing for us," and added: "It's such an emotional issue with people. They say to us, 'You can't go after churches.' "
But Mr. Bond insisted that "churches were not targeted. Code violations were."
As places of public assembly, churches fall under specific building and fire safety codes, which govern such subjects as emergency exits and electrical wiring. Mr. Casserly said that these little churches uniformly ignored the codes, posing a safety hazard.
"A house may hold 30 or 40 people," he said. "They tear out the interior walls and install pews. These are wood-frame houses with no sprinklers and only two means of egress. The carpet is not flame-resistant."
"Code enforcement, or lack thereof, is the greatest concern among homeowners in this community," Mr. Bond said. "Where there is space available, and zoning code allows it, churches should be built. And where there is not, they should not."
The debate over the churches comes in the context of a larger drive to clean up North Amityville, which has had a black community since before the Civil War but fell on hard times only in the last quarter of the 20th century.
In the early postwar years, North Amityville was a model community for America's emerging black middle class. Many black veterans of World War II settled here as an alternative to Levittown, which was segregated white.
"North Amityville was a social experiment," said Mr. Bond, the son of a World War II veteran and a North Amityville native. "And I was part of that social experiment."
Chuck Howlett, a social studies teacher at Amityville High School since 1977 and a scholar of North Amityville history, said that it was only in the late 1970's and early 80's that crime became a serious problem. The intersection of Great Neck Road and Albany Avenue, known as the Corner, became an open-air market for drug dealers and a mecca of the crack cocaine epidemic of the late 1980's.
The drug market enraged the community, Mr. Howlett said. "I remember students saying to me, 'This isn't us,' " he said. "It was a sore point. So the community fought back."
Residents formed grass-roots groups that worked closely with the Suffolk County Police Department to rid the hamlet of abandoned vehicles, crime and drugs. Their efforts, which were helped by federal financing, have paid off. Police spokesmen say crime has decreased significantly. The Corner now boasts a Rite-Aid drug store and a European-American Bank.
Frank Dell Accio, owner of Century 21 AA Realty in Lindenhurst, said home prices had increased recently in North Amityville and more homes were owner-occupied. And Robert Toussie, a Brooklyn developer, is scheduled to break ground next year for a 76-home subdivision near the intersection of Albany Avenue and Schleigel Boulevard. Houses in the new development will be priced at $300,000 to $400,000, double the average sale price of a North Amityville home, according to Mr. Dell Accio. Mr. Casserly said that five years ago such an investment in North Amityville was "unheard of."
As part of the cleanup campaign, the town also began stricter enforcement of building codes and included the little churches were included in the scrutiny.
Standing next to a lateral file in the planning office of Babylon's Town Hall, Mr. Casserly pulled open a drawer stuffed tight with files, all of which contained the paperwork on code violations for individual churches. Some of the recorded code violations go back as far as 1984.
At least 15 churches are now in violation in the North Amityville area, having ignored town summonses, Mr. Casserly said, with many more churches in various stages of getting their facilities up to code.
Shutting down a church is an arduous legal process that can take months, he said. "You actually need to witness the violations. You need affidavits," Mr. Casserly said. Often the town must pay overtime for a church to be inspected on a Sunday, because during the week nobody is there.
Ms. Wilson of New Life Christian Ministries, at 124 Albany Avenue, said she did not understand why the town acted.
"We are charged to serve," Ms. Wilson said. "It all started when God told me to build a house for him." The church, she said, is just trying to give homeless people a better quality of life.
"People didn't come in here with hats and dresses," she said, but they were coming in off the street, "and it was making a difference."
Ms. Wilson also operates six homeless shelters in North Amityville and Wyandanch. All are part of New Life Ministries, which she founded in 1988 with five other people.
She bought 124 Albany Avenue, which was a deli with a small house behind it, in October 1999. She soon converted it into a church, complete with facade and pews. She made the house in the back into another shelter.
Maxine Postal, the Suffolk County legislator whose district includes North Amityville, said that when the church opened, her office promptly received calls from neighbors.
"Carrie Wilson is very well known in the community," Ms. Postal said. For years, she said, residents have been upset about her shelters. Ms. Postal said that only two of Ms. Wilson's six shelters were in compliance with town building codes.
Since 1994, Suffolk County's Department of Social Services has contracted with New Life to provide shelter for the homeless. Dennis Nowak, a spokesman for the department, said that the county was not aware that Ms. Wilson's shelters had ever had code violations. County contracts stipulate that shelters must comply with town codes.
But Ms. Postal said the social services department turned a blind eye. "They obviously continue to pay people who are not in compliance," she said. "We've talked with social services. I think they just want to get the problem out of their hair."
Ms. Postal said that residents of Ms. Wilson's shelters had frequently called her office to complain about bad treatment, reporting that they were forced to surrender their food stamps, were not allowed to use the phone and were not given enough food.
Mr. Nowak said that these were old issues that were either unsubstantiated or have been resolved.
When Ms. Wilson opened her church on North Albany Avenue, Ms. Postal said, "this was the icing on the cake." According to Patricia Howlett, an attorney for the town, the church had "hundreds of violations." The town obtained an injunction against New Life in September, which enabled them to close the church down. The case is still in litigation.
Ms. Postal called Ms. Wilson a "poverty pimp."
"Carrie -- and this strikes everyone -- is covered in diamonds and gold," she said. "She drives a new Mercedes. She has had extensive work done on her house on Parkway Avenue in Amityville. I think all these things make people think she is ripping them off."
Ms. Postal, who is white and has represented the district since 1987, said that because Ms. Wilson was a pastor no one challenged her.
"We're working so hard to fix up North Amityville," Ms. Postal said. "And I'm fed up."
Ms. Wilson said her ministry had been part of the solution in North Amityville. "Before, there was a dog blight in the community, just drugs, prostitution and people hanging out," she said. "God wants us to clean up our own backyard."
Other pastors in North Amityville say they have a good relationship with the town. The Rev. Jimmy Jack of Freedom Chapel, at 641 Broadway, which was forced to tear down a wooden house that was used for offices and children's Sunday church services, said nevertheless that the town had been "patient and very cooperative."
Frank Alberti, one of six Babylon town lawyers, said that state courts expected local zoning boards to give greater deference to religious institutions than to commercial or residential owners. Therefore, Mr. Alberti said, the town tries to help churches get up to code as best they can.
Mr. Casserly said that the churches' problem often was inadequate financing. But in the last year, he said, perhaps because of the improved economy, about a dozen churches have come up with the money to bring themselves up to code.
St. Paul's Christian Tabernacle of America, at 589 Broadway in Amityville, is one of those churches that the town has, in Mr. Casserly's words, "nurtured along." The church broke ground in 1984, then ran out of money. For 10 years, the congregation, which numbers about 100, has been holding services in the foundation with tar paper on top.
"It's been a difficult history," said the Rev. Raymond Thompkins, St. Paul's pastor. "Banks don't like to lend churches money. And there are so many charlatans out there. One guy got our money and disappeared. He did the same to seven or eight other churches in Amityville, $37,000 from each church."
But St. Paul's now has its finances together. With loans from Fleet Bank and the United Mortgage Company, Mr. Thompkins hopes that St. Paul's will be finished by the end of the year.
"Over the years the town has been very good to us," he said. "As the Bible says, we are subject to the laws of the land. These churches must be constructed in the right way."

$320 Million Gives State Universities a New Look

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
ALMOST $320 million of construction is completed, under way or ready to begin at the four campuses of the Connecticut State University system as part of a five-year capital improvement program that is changing the look of the schools.
At Western Connecticut State University in Danbury, Thomas E. Carlone, the director of planning and engineering, said that the university had completed a $19 million library expansion and a $22 million, 425-bed residence hall. Planning is soon to begin, he said, for a $9 million student center. 
 "When I came to Connecticut 11 years ago, there was a tremendous amount of money being spent on prisons," Mr. Carlone said. "Then people started to say maybe we should spend money on the good kids rather than the bad kids. Today, our kids are benefiting from that redirection of funds."
At Eastern Connecticut State University in Willimantic, a new four-story library and a 3,500-square-foot admissions building are in use this semester, as is a new residential village that accommodates 440 students in apartments with common computer laboratories, study areas and exercise rooms.
At Central Connecticut State University in New Britain, a $5 million, 2,400-seat football stadium was dedicated last Saturday. Construction is nearing completion on its new 83,000-square-foot Vance Academic Center, the first new academic building there since 1973.
At Southern Connecticut State University in New Haven, a 600-car parking garage went up in just eight months. "We need about three more of them, but this is a start," said Robert G. Sheeley, Southern's associate dean for facilities planning and operations. "We have no place to go but up -- if we did only surface parking, we've have an all-asphalt campus."
University officials say the state plan should go further. Richard L. Judd, president of Central, said that he is still short about 800 beds in his residence halls, that he can no longer get most of the parts for the four circa-1922 boilers that heat the school, and that the smokestack has been deemed unsafe for anyone to climb inside for an inspection.
"If two of those boilers go down, the campus would have to close," Dr. Judd said. In addition, he said, he is short on staff space, with as many as three faculty members sharing 90-square-foot offices. Most schools try to provide at least 150 square feet per professor, he said. He also said he has no auditorium large enough for graduation ceremonies and other functions.
William J. Cibes Jr., the chancellor of the university system, which last year had 18,400 full-time and 7,800 part-time students, has asked the Connecticut Board of Higher Education to seek an additional $600 million, $120 million a year for five years. Such an appropriation from the state, he said, would allow the campuses to build new academic buildings, heating plants, libraries and athletic centers.
"Now that we are nearing the end of the first five years, we want to know what's going to happen next," Dr. Cibes said. Before the capital improvement project that got under way in the 1997-98 fiscal year, he said, it had been 20 years since there was any major construction on the four campuses. "This would basically bring the universities back to where they should have been," he said.
In 1995, the state appropriated almost $1 billion for construction and renovation at its major research and graduate university, the 17,800-student University of Connecticut at Storrs, which is separate from the state university system. Two years later, legislators turned their attention to the other components of the state's higher education system, allocating $320 million for the state universities, and $320 million more for the 12 two-year state community colleges.
Mayor Lucian J. Pawlak of New Britain said that the state universities bring a lot of attention to their cities. Central's Institute for Industrial Engineering and Technology, he said, complements the city's efforts to replace the large manufacturers that have left and attract smaller high-technology firms.
"It is a major asset -- on any given day there might be 300 or 400 people here training, and two or three companies looking to become members," Mr. Pawlak said. "It really does enrich our community."
Over the last few years, more new construction and renovation has taken place on the state university campuses than in the tenure of all but the most senior staff. "This work was long overdue," said Dr. Felton O. Best, a professor of philosophy, history and religious studies at Central who is head of the faculty senate. "When I came here in 1991 I though the university had some real potential, but it needed some work. Now morale on campus is improving because of all the construction."
Dennis A. Hannon, vice president for finance and administration at Eastern, said the construction had also offered an opportunity for innovation at the Willimantic campus. The nine-story residence hall on that campus will have its electric heating system removed and a new geothermal heating and cooling system installed.
WITH the construction of the new library at Eastern, the old library building has been renovated and turned into a student support services center. A 40,000-square-foot addition is to be built at the old library next year to bring together, for the first time, all the administrative offices.
At Western, Mr. Carlone said that some of the smaller projects have been the most noticed. About $4 million was spent on new lighting, a brick sidewalk, underground electric wires and other improvements on a new quadrangle at the Danbury campus.
"Even though that was not the largest project in terms of dollar value, it's probably had the biggest impact on student morale," Mr. Carlone said. "We've been able to clean up the campus a lot. The mayor and a lot of local folks have told me that the transition has just been miraculous."
Much of the work in the five-year plan for the four campuses remains to be completed. At Central, construction is to start next summer on a 1,000-car parking garage. An $11 million expansion and renovation of the student center is to begin soon after, as is a $20 million renovation of the current science building, where some of the equipment no longer meets safety standards.
Dr. Cibes, the chancellor, said he expected that his new proposal would face serious scrutiny and debate. He said that the state's yearly capital investment at the four state universities is about $2,740 per student, less than half what it spends at the University of Connecticut in Storrs. Even $600 million in new financing would bring spending at the state universities to only about 71 percent of what it is at UConn, he said. "We're very pleased that UConn got all that money, and we don't want to take anything away from UConn, we just want to get a fair share for our students," Dr. Cibes said.
The state universities have much larger combined enrollment than does UConn, he said. And the state universities are already seeing significant increases in students interested in enrolling, he added -- at Eastern, applications were up more than 40 percent this year.
The growing interest is due at least in part to the construction on the campuses, he said, though he acknowledged that in a good economy more people can afford higher education and that more jobs are demanding a four-year degree.
But whatever the reason, he said, the estimate is that enrollment at the state universities is going to increase about 23 percent over the next 12 years, and the schools must be ready for it.
Mr. Cibes's proposal would finance three projects in the fiscal year that begins next July 1: $12 million for new underground utilities at the Central campus in New Britain, $18 million for a new boiler plant at Southern in New Haven and $43 million for a new science center at Western in Danbury. His proposal includes a $46 million science building at Eastern in Willimantic and $54 million in renovations to the library at Southern in the fiscal year that begins July 1, 2002.
The following year would bring a $50 million fine arts center at Eastern, and $28 million of renovations to classrooms at Central. In 2004-05, the projects would include a $27 million fine arts center at Western and a $20 million classroom building at Central. The final year of his plan would include a $42 million student services building at Southern, a $47 million field house at Central and a $42 million field house at Eastern.
Dr. Judd of Central said the state should view the projects as an investment in its future. Studies of his alumni, he said, show that 95 percent of graduates stay in Connecticut and that 85 percent live in 30 towns surrounding New Britain.
"What that tells you is that when they go to school here, they go to work in Connecticut businesses, government agencies, and so forth," Dr. Judd said. "That clearly contributes to keeping the income levels high in the state, because we have a well-educated work force. If we're going to bring high-technology companies to Connecticut, we're going to need our kids to do it."

HEADLINE: Changing Fields (and Lawns and Gardens)

BYLINE: By ELISABETH GINSBURG

 BODY:
THE gardening bug is an insidious disease. Once stricken, some victims feel a compulsion to spend all their free time digging in the dirt and all their money buying plants and seeds. Others go even further and transform their working lives by entering the horticultural field.
John Holm, a former professional chef, is in the midst of such a career transformation. Born in Norway to a family that owned a restaurant, he was trained as a cook from an early age. Mr. Holm eventually immigrated to the United States and found work at Manhattan restaurants like La Grenouille and Restaurant 44. He also taught cooking at the French Culinary Institute and helped found a successful prepared-food business. 
 While a chef, Mr. Holm began tending a container garden on the terrace of his Brooklyn Heights apartment. Eventually he moved to a 2.5-acre lot in Bedford, N.Y., and began growing things on a larger scale. He applied to the New York Botanical Garden's School of Professional Horticulture, a two-year program that combines course work with hands-on training in the botanical garden itself. He expects to graduate in 2002 and start his own residential landscape design business.
Training that combines horticulture's intellectual and practical sides makes perfect sense to Mr. Holm, who has a high tolerance for the unglamorous and unpaid work in the botanical garden. "Because of my background in cooking," he said, "I am used to working hard and getting dirty." But "I feel a passion for this that I never did for cooking," he added. "I went into cooking because of my family. This I did for myself."
Five years ago, Mary Squires was a corporate attorney living on Long Island. Then she and her husband moved to Upper Saddle River, N.J. After finding out what it cost to hire landscapers, she decided to design her new property herself -- even though she had little experience with plants. "I started researching before I put anything in the ground," she said. Her interest increased, and after she had become a regular at her local retail nursery, a clerk suggested she take some horticulture courses at Bergen County College.
She began her studies with two courses, including Plant, Soil and Science, one of the toughest classes in the two-year degree program. Eventually she became immersed in horticulture education and went to school full time. She received a certificate in landscaping and ornamental horticulture (with honors), and went on to earn an associate's degree in applied science.
With her degrees in hand, Ms. Squires hung out her shingle as a plant consultant, installing and maintaining gardens, doing soil tests and educating her clients about environment-friendly methods of dealing with garden pests.
Ms. Squires specializes in interior "plantscaping," helping her clients with selection and placement of indoor plants. On each job she uses a light meter to gauge the amount of light in specific indoor locations, so people avoid dark corners full of dying plants. This educated approach is something new for her. "In my past life," she said, "I would just buy a plant and water it."
Ms. Squires still does a limited amount of legal work, "just to keep my hand in." In addition to running her own business, she hopes to gain greenhouse management experience by working part time for a local nursery within the next year.
Ms. Squires has no regrets about trading case management for pest management. "The time that I spend in gardens is infinitely more rewarding than the most demanding legal case," she said.
Kathleen Nelson of Gaylordsville, spends her spring, summer and fall days growing and selling perennials, a home-based business that she began when she made a midlife career change two decades ago. Busy outdoors during the growing season, she spends the winter writing copy for her plant catalog, doing bookkeeping and planning for the coming season.
Ms. Nelson grew up in "the swamps of northern Minnesota," collecting plants in the abundant wetlands. After obtaining a master's degree in zoology, she taught biology at Manhattan Community College. "I loved teaching," she said.
But in the mid-1970's, layoffs within the City University system left Ms. Nelson unemployed. A new job at the University of Bridgeport brought an unexpected bonus -- a husband. Ms. Nelson left teaching and entered professional horticulture at the age of 41, when she had her first child.
"The first couple of years, I didn't know what I was doing," she said. Her science background helped her learn quickly, and trial and error enabled her to make the decision to focus on retail rather than wholesale customers. Her business grew, bolstered by the surge in public interest in perennial plants around the time she started in the 1980's.
Ms. Nelson specializes in shade plants, noninvasive grasses and deer-resistant species, which also feature in her landscape designs for a small number of clients.
As her business has flourished, Ms. Nelson's environmental concerns have grown. A stint on a local wetlands commission changed her focus to promoting native plants. Though natives are enjoying something of a renaissance, she thinks they need more exposure.
Ms. Nelson's child is now a college junior, and the second career continues to evolve. Though she gives occasional lectures, she said that a return to the classroom would be "emotionally draining." Running her small nursery, said Ms. Nelson, is the perfect combination of physical and intellectual activity.
That combination also appeals to Laura Leach, who made the switch to horticulture after 15 years as a sales, marketing and development executive. Like Mr. Holm, Ms. Leach, who lives in Hastings, N.Y., is now a student in the New York Botanical Garden's horticulture school.
Ms. Leach, who was born in England, has a love of gardening that she inherited from her mother and grandmother. In high school she considered a horticultural career, but chose other options.
After leaving school, Ms. Leach re-encountered horticulture when she took a marketing job with Britain's National Trust, which oversees many historic structures and gardens. Later she worked as the director of development for the Welsh National Opera.
As with Ms. Nelson, marriage helped propel Ms. Leach into a new life. Several years ago, she and her husband immigrated to California, where she began part-time horticultural studies. The following year the couple moved to the East Coast. She had discovered the botanical garden's program on the Internet, and chose it because it provided "the opportunity to work alongside the best horticulturists." She praises the program's diversity. "Today I am preparing seeds for a seed exchange; yesterday I was climbing an oak tree to prune it," she said.
When she graduates in the spring of 2002, Ms. Leach may work as an administrator for a horticultural institution. She also plans to continue her education in landscape design. But she is also keeping her options open. "I am looking at where my skills are," she added.
Ms. Leach had advice for those considering a similar career change. "It's important to have some practical experience in the field first," she said, noting that the botanical garden program requires such hands-on work as a prerequisite for admission.
And, while a horticultural career may ultimately provide those who choose it with time to stop and smell the roses, she advised anyone approaching the field to be "realistic, not romantic."

HEADLINE: High-Tech but Low Grades

BYLINE: By GEORGE JAMES

 BODY:
WHAT does the rest of the country think of New Jersey as a high-tech state? Not much.
Prosperity New Jersey, a public-private nonprofit partnership created by the state to attract high-tech companies, commissioned the Opinion Research Corporation of Princeton to find out what industry people around the country considered a "hotbed" of high-tech and how New Jersey compared. 
 Stephen R. Sasala II, president and chief executive of Prosperity New Jersey, said that last year and early this year, researchers met with 80 executives from companies in Alexandria, Va., Chicago, Raleigh, N.C., and Austin, Tex.
Asked to list prerequisites for strong high-tech areas, the executives said: access to skilled employees; high quality of life for employees; good transportation, communications and office space; access to equity and capital; a business-friendly environment; education and research institutions; and a critical mass of complementary companies.
What were some hotbeds of techology?
The answers included Silicon Valley in California; Route 128 in the Boston area; Research Triangle Park in North Carolina; the Austin, Dallas and Plano area; and the District of Columbia and its suburbs in Virginia and Maryland. New Jersey received only one mention -- for its pharmaceutical industry.
When the executives were asked to name emerging areas, they mentioned Denver, Boulder, Colo., Chicago, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Salt Lake City. Oak Ridge, Tenn., and Detroit as well as the New York and Philadelphia "areas." But again, no New Jersey.
Just what "images, words and phrases" came to mind when they thought of New Jersey? Don't ask.
"Not high-tech," was one response, although AT&T, Bell Labs and Lucent were frequently mentioned.
Of course, they immediately thought of the New Jersey Turnpike, the Garden State Parkway and traffic circles. They saw New Jersey as a "drive-through state," a suburb of New York and Philadelphia. Newark International Airport did not impress them.
High unemployment, high crime and congestion were mentioned along with high cost of living, high taxes, dying towns, old businesses, refineries, swamps. They even used the word "smelly." The final indictment: "Can't pump your own gas."
When the researchers finally read them a fact sheet listing New Jersey's high-tech credentials and assets, everyone was flabbergasted, Mr. Sasala said.
"My initial thought, that New Jersey is boring, is wrong," said one person.
"What was remarkable," said Mr. Sasala, "was the feedback we got from these people after we shared the facts -- which by the way, nobody refuted."
Mr. Sasala added with a laugh, "We enhanced our credibility, because they said, 'You guys do an incredible job of keeping your light under a bushel.' "

From a Cellar, the State's Second-Largest Brewer

BYLINE: By ROBERT STRAUSS

DATELINE: CHERRY HILL

 BODY:
GENE MULLER smiled with a self-effacing grin.
"Yes, we're New Jersey's second-largest brewery," he said. "Second only to Anheuser-Busch. Those are the Bud people, you know." 
 Mr. Muller is the president and, as he calls himself, chief custodian of Flying Fish Brewing Company.
While Anheuser-Busch has its Clydesdale carriages and Super Bowl sponsorships, Flying Fish settles for some T-shirts and tours on Saturday afternoons.
If you want a Bud, you can probably find it anywhere from the World Trade Center to an alley in Calcutta. Looking for a Flying Fish? You had better be within a half-day's drive of Mr. Muller's eight clean steel vats, which back out onto a loading platform in a low-rise building at the edge of an industrial park here.
There are about two dozen breweries in New Jersey, mostly in the northern part of the state. All but Busch make fewer than 7,500 barrels of beer a year, which is what Flying Fish makes and which is, frankly, not much. It's why they call them microbreweries, or what Mr. Muller prefers to call a "craft brewery."
"That means you are trying to do a quality product without additives or preservatives and it really doesn't matter how big you are," he said. "Sam Adams, a craft brewery, does 1.2 million barrels a year, which is almost as much as, say, Beck's. I just want to do a good beer, make some money and have fun. Beer is, after all, a fun product."
Mr. Muller used to have fun making beer in his basement. For 15 years, he said, he was a home brewer while he worked as an advertising copywriter in Philadelphia. Then in 1995, he decided to go to a brewing school, the Siebel Institute in Chicago, where among his fellow students was a young member of a Colorado beer-making family, Brad Coors.
He came back to New Jersey -- Mr. Muller grew up in Pine Hill and now lives in Haddon Township -- and started figuring out what he would do with this newfound knowledge. He thought about opening a brewpub in Philadelphia, but there were already several there. So he sought financing and a home for his own brewery.
In the meantime, the Internet started burgeoning, so Mr. Muller started a Web site for Flying Fish.
"I called it the world's first virtual microbrewery," he said. "We were selling pint glasses and T-shirts and we didn't even have a building, much less a beer."
Slowly, his money, about $1 million for the start-up, came through and he found the right amount of space in the Cherry Hill Industrial Park, just behind the Garden State Discovery Museum. The beer started flowing in late 1996 and the kudos began pouring in not long afterward. Flying Fish has won medals at the World Beer Championships and is the only New Jersey brewery featured in the 1999 edition of the book "Best American Beers."
A tour of Flying Fish does not have the cachet of those Clydesdales and adjacent amusement parks at a Busch Gardens. You find one big open floor in the back of the industrial park where the whole operation takes place, with Mr. Muller, his four brewmasters and a handful of other employees.
Mr. Muller buys malted barley from the Midwest, Canada and Belgium. His hops come from several places: some from the Pacific Northwest, some from the Czech Republic and some from his own backyard. The water is not from some mountain spring, but from right here in Cherry Hill.
"Rolling Rock and Coors would make you believe the secret ingredient in beer is water," Mr. Muller said. "What you need is good water, not exotic water, and Cherry Hill water is just fine. But the big thing is the yeast."
Mr. Muller's yeast is recycled several times through the Flying Fish vats, in essence making each new beer a cousin of its predecessors.
Mr. Muller likes the idea of recycling his products. He give the barley left over from the initial fermentations to Don Emmons, one of the last dairy farmers in Burlington County, for his cows.
"So you get beer and chocolate milk from the same stuff around here," he said.
Flying Fish makes four styles of beer on a regular basis and a variety of seasonal beers. There is the Extra Pale Ale, a gold-colored beer that is the closest thing Flying Fish has to a pilsner. Then there is the dark Porter and the slightly lighter Belgian-style Abbey Dubbel, which is triple-fermented. Finally, there is the ESB, which stands for Extra Special Bitter, which Mr. Muller said goes well with strong foods like meats, cheeses and chocolate.
"That's what people learn when they come here, that beer and chocolate can go together," Mr. Muller said. "But seriously, some beers go better with some foods. You probably wouldn't want to drink a strong beer with a delicate fish. Although then there is pizza. And any beer goes well with that, don't you think?"
Flying Fish is experimenting with new special brews, one with Belgian sour cherries and another using Jack Daniels whiskey. If you find them, though, they will probably be in kegs behind your favorite bar, not in bottles.
"We sell everything we can make," said Mr. Muller, who distributes Flying Fish to New Jersey, eastern Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware and, surprisingly, Walt Disney World, where the owner of the Flying Fish restaurant uses the eponymous brew as its house beer.
"If you try to make more, then you may sacrifice quality or get too overextended," he said. "We want to grow, sure, but at a good pace.
"After all, we don't want to scare off Busch, as good as they are for the New Jersey economy."

HEADLINE: Lasers and Laptops Join Hard Hats At Construction Sites

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
CONSTRUCTION company officials are among the first to admit that their industry had been slow to embrace technology. "It's been a dinosaur," according to Joseph Maguire, a vice president of Bovis Lend Lease in New York. But as if making up for lost time, the industry, which the Commerce Department estimates at more than $400 billion, has bestirred itself in recent years to embrace technology with an alacrity that, if it does not yet approach warp speed, at least takes construction out of the Mesozoic Era.
At construction sites ranging from the Millennium Partners hotel and apartment building at the Battery to AvalonBay's residential tower in New Rochelle, project managers and architects find laptop computers and digital cameras as necessary as hard hats. Crane operators rely on computer screens and on software that programs their every move, and contractors make use of e-mail and digital images to seek advice on solving problems. 
 Even the familiar level, used by generations of plumbers, carpenters and do-it-yourselfers, has undergone a high-tech makeover, its liquid bubbles replaced by pulsating bands of red light that snake around walls and floors to determine whether the construction work is the way it should be.
The main reasons for the rapid embrace of technology have been the power, speed and ubiquity of the computer and the advent of the Internet as well as affordable and improved construction software.
The upshot is that it is a rare major construction company whose job sites or home offices are not aswarm with laptops, digital cameras and scanners, as well as hand-held devices that connect to the Internet and others that can double as phones and two-way radios and are able to send and receive e-mail.
Using the Internet, construction companies submit bids, order material, schedule deliveries and hire workers. Tishman Construction Corporation, a pioneer in applying technology, solicits resumes on its Web site. "The people you're hiring these days expect you to have the technological tools," said Edward J. Cettina, a Tishman first vice president.
Those tools benefit more than builders. Many construction companies photograph their job sites at regular intervals to judge for themselves the state of a project and also to let owners or subcontractors follow the progress.
On the site of the joint-use 40-story Ritz-Carlton Hotel and apartment building going up at the southern end of Battery Park City, Bill Shaughnessy, the Bovis project manager, calls up photos on his laptop, taken from a camera atop a building across the street, of not only the building but also the job site trailer in which he and a visitor are talking.
And the same Bovis Web site can also call up photos of the other projects it is doing for Millennium -- two each in Boston and Washington and one each in San Francisco and Miami. The images "come into our main office lobby over telephone lines, and six monitors show the progress of the various construction sites," said Matthew Hall, a Millennium spokesman. "The photos are very valuable to owners and construction managers, who can keep up to date on their progress. But they're also linked to our Web site and sent to our sales office uptown to show to prospective buyers."
Electronic gear now shows up throughout the construction industry. "Only a few years ago companies used pens and calculators for estimating a project," said Colin Parkes, director of technical services for Bovis Lend Lease. "Today we have computer-aided estimating systems, scheduling systems, financial accounting systems and project control systems. They're not only quicker and more accurate, they let you look at different scenarios. Today our systems bridge the world."
The main thrust of the high-tech gadgetry is to enable project teams on job sites and at corporate headquarters to have immediate access to one another, as well as to architects, designers and engineers who may be hundreds, even thousands, of miles away.
With the help of computer-aided design, architects and engineers increasingly produce plans, drawings and other construction documents on computers. Those documents can be uploaded to the construction company's Web site and from there downloaded into individual computers -- including the computers of clients and subcontractors.
Changes that in the past would have required days of face-to-face meetings to sort out can now be approved in hours. And the e-mails authorizing changes provide an automatic paper trail, buttressed in many cases by the digital photos that document projects in various stages of construction.
DOCUMENTS can also be created by architects and engineers to analyze what Mark P. Job, the director of the Tishman Technologies Corporation, terms what-if scenarios "that study the effects of alternative design, materials and manpower with greater speed and precision than before the use of digital media."
Many contractors say that speed and precision are more vital to their industry than ever.
"We used to denominate everything in dollars," said Thomas C. Leppert, the chief executive of Turner Construction, speaking of the industry generally. "Now we denominate it in time." And access to people and information are the keys.
When the F. J. Sciame Construction Company of Manhattan was building a foundation in Rockland County last year for Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, the project ran into the problem of how to bridge a rock formation.
"I e-mailed a digital photo of the problem to our engineers in New York and asked how to solve it, and we had an answer within an hour and a half," said Robert D. Trostle, the project manager. "In the past we would have had to send the photo back to the office, the engineers would have had to see it and generate a solution, then fax it back to us. This way, we saved two days."
In construction these days, a lot can be done in just two days. Turner Construction, for example, is building 409 apartments in New Rochelle for AvalonBay Communities, a real estate investment trust based in Alexandria, Va., at what not long ago would have been breakneck speed.
"Our cycle for building the floors is to place concrete on the slab in the morning and at the end of the same day set the columns on top of the concrete for the next floor," said Peter J. Davoren, the Turner senior vice president in charge of construction in the New York area as well as in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. "At the end of the second day, we're getting the slab ready for the next major pour, and the following day we place concrete in the slab and repeat the entire cycle."
Since a digital camera mounted on a nearby building takes photos of the site every 15 minutes and then downloads them onto the Internet, Mr. Davoren can check the progress in New Rochelle or on most of his other projects.
When A. J. McNulty & Company of Maspeth, Queens, was awarded the job last year of cladding the 14-story Embassy Suites hotel in Battery Park City with brick-faced precast panels, it rolled up to the site with a massive crane capable of lifting as much as 440 tons. At its outer limits, the machine's tower, or boom, stands 207 feet tall and holds a protecting arm, or jib, that is 299 feet long. Taking up a four-month residence at one side of the building, the crane proceeded to lift panels as wide as 30 feet and as heavy as 15 tons clear over the 140-foot high hotel.
"Before, we would have had to place the crane on each side of the building in order to clad it completely," said Larry Weiss, president of McNulty and of its affiliated company, Cranes Inc., a rental company. "This time we were able to clad three sides of it from the same location; then we brought in a smaller crane to do the fourth side."
The huge crane used at the Embassy Suites, like almost all cranes built in the past few years, has an instrument panel that somewhat resembles that of a jet plane. Its built-in computer system monitors the load to be picked up, the radius in which the load will be taken and the pressure that will be exerted by the crane and its load. If the load approaches 80 percent of the crane's capacity, the crane emits both a visual and audible warning signal, then shuts down as soon as it reaches the 80 percent mark.
"Not long ago licensed professional engineers had to calculate the loads themselves before they could secure the permit for using the crane," Mr. Weiss said. "Now they can prepare a drawing and submit the computer's calculations to the city's buildings department for the permit."
Other recently upgraded tools used in construction include the surveyors' instrument, which sends out an infrared beam to an object; the beam is reflected back and the distance is calculated and displayed electronically. The data can be downloaded directly into a computer, which can create a finished drawing to be printed out or e-mailed.
"The surveyor's instrument, which includes a theodolite and an electronic distance measuring device, eliminates the need to measure angles and distances separately," said Robert R. Prescott, the president of the New York State Association of Professional Land Surveyors. "The profession has gone from being extremely labor intensive to being able to focus more precisely on the analysis of the measurements being taken."
Thomas Piciocco, a partner in the Manhattan surveying firm of Earl B. Lovell-S. P. Belcher, said that while the surveyor's instrument can measure distances up to 300 feet, "buildings are too close for me to use it in Manhattan."
Even the familiar level, used by generations of plumbers, carpenters and do-it-yourselfers, has undergone a high-tech makeover. Looking like a cross between a warning light at a rural railroad crossing and strobe lights at a late night disco, the electronic level can be set at any height to emit a band of red light around a room at the push of a button.
"It can be placed on a tripod or any flat surface, and it doesn't take anyone to operate it when it's set up," said Ron Rudolph, a former carpenter and now the project executive for Turner Construction's project to expand the San Diego Convention Center. "It's also much more accurate than the earlier levels, and it can be used by most of the trades."
THE same device can also be used outdoors when preparing sites for construction. Small electronic receivers placed on earth-leveling grading machines zero in on the laser beam, Mr. Rudolph said, and automatically adjust the machine's blade so that it prepares the surface at the predetermined grade.
Construction company executives stress that for all the technological advances, the most important cog in the construction process remains the plumbers, carpenters, steamfitters, electricians and many other tradesmen who do the actual work.
Still, no construction company is likely to forsake the technology that enables the electronic transmission of architectural plans and drawings, that enables work orders to be changed easily and quickly, that processes payrolls and estimates the number of workers and days needed on a project and that does away with layers of paperwork and administration.
"Before all this technology, it required more people to administer projects," said Scott A. Silverman, director of management information systems for Slattery Skanska. "Then, the administrators also put together invoices out in the field. Now they send the amount of work done that day to accountants who create invoices automatically."
Tishman has not done away with its 229-page construction manual, with information on everything from budgeting and estimating to scheduling, purchasing and site safety, but the manual is now available on a CD-ROM as well as online. And Tishman's project schedules for its many contractors are also online.
Two years ago, Clive Chan, Tishman's director of scheduling, sent e-mails with attached drawings and updated schedules to everyone in the company. But by last year he was posting them on the Internet -- in this case, an "extranet," a private network. This enables project-related drawings and documents to be stored online for access to the level of information determined by a user's password.
The Internet is also coming to the rescue of the "punch list" -- constructionspeak for the requisite final check. "It's a tedious job to do a punch list accurately," said Mitchell Solomon, chief executive of the HRH Construction Corporation. "It can easily take a few months to go through a building systematically, because there are thousands of items to check. That makes it easy to overlook something like a missing wall plate or a gouge in a Sheetrock wall."
For that reason HRH put together its own system of listing everything to be checked for each job. "Once the information is loaded," Mr. Solomon said, "you can view all the physical characteristics of a building by floor, by apartment, even by contractor." And because the computerized punch list records the dates that problems were discovered and remedied, he added, "You have a record without having to scramble through a paper blizzard."
Economic pressures have played a part in inducing both contractors and the subcontractors who do much of the specialized work on construction sites to embrace new technology.
"If we had stayed with the usual methods, we wouldn't have survived," said Donald G. Romano, the chief executive of Heritage Air Systems of Deer Park, N.Y., a contractor and manufacturer of heating and air conditioning systems. Heritage worked on the Rose Center for Earth and Space at the American Museum of Natural History and has been at work about 14 months now on the 45-story Bear Stearns headquarters under construction in midtown Manhattan.
Those "usual methods" had some 15 to 18 employees cutting sheet metal with hand tools into patterns according to consulting engineers' specifications. These days, the specifications are put into a computer, then downloaded into Heritage's manufacturing plant, where the information is transferred by fiber optics into four cutting machines, operated by one person each, that automatically cut the material to size.
"It has increased our efficiency dramatically," Mr. Romano said. And in an industry where in the past as much as 30 percent of the workday was estimated to have been spent waiting around for everything from approved design changes to delivery of construction materials, increased efficiency can make a huge difference.
TO stay in touch on the job, Heritage project managers carry palmtop computers and two-way radios, and its other employees also carry the two-way radios. The company also keeps track of its 26 construction and service trucks using the Global Positioning System -- a technology also used to establish the position of boats, airplanes and even adventurers who have lost their way. By punching up a map in the office, Mr. Romano said, the system can be used to show the exact location of every vehicle, so a truck stuck in traffic jams can possibly be diverted to other routes or another vehicle can be dispatched in its place.
But hardly anyone considers high tech the end-all, be-all for construction. "The online project people would have you think you can do it all on the computers," Mr. Solomon of HRH Construction said, "but it's more complicated than that."
Even those huge cranes that seem right out of the space age have their limitations. When the same crane used on the Embassy Suites project worked earlier this year at the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, where a four-story building is being added within a courtyard, it easily lifted the 40-ton steel beams over the courtyard walls.
But because the crane operator could not see the other side and even though he had telephone communication with others on the project team who could have directed him, the possibility of a disruption in voice contact resulted in the use of one of the oldest forms of communication known to mankind -- hand signals.

Even His Souffles Can't Relax

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
In the summer of 1999, George David and his 50-foot sailboat, Idler, led a United States team in competition for the Admiral's Cup. He expected to win. He came in third in his class.
Was he mad? Distraught? Disheartened, at least? "I was disappointed," was as far as Mr. David would go. 
 Emotional outbursts are just not part of George David's behavioral repertoire. Take his reaction to General Electric's John F. Welch Jr. Just as United Technologies, the company Mr. David has headed since 1994, was about to announce a merger with Honeywell International, Mr. Welch, the chairman of G. E., topped Mr. David's $40 billion offer by $5 billion. Months of planning, of due diligence, of negotiations, went down the drain.
So, when Mr. David ran into Mr. Welch in Florida a few days later, did the sparks fly? "He acted totally professional," Mr. Welch recalled. "I like the guy, and I think he likes me."
Here is Mr. David's take on it: "I'm not sore. Jack and I are voracious competitors but we have an easy relationship." But, with a twinkle in his eye, he added, "It was nice of Mr. Welch to validate our business judgment and to overpay."
It was vintage George David: calm, controlled, competitive, but willing to accept defeat -- all while probably negotiating another deal. "We have 50 people working on mergers full time, and we probably have $3 billion to $4 billion in deals in various stages," he said.
United Technologies is doing fine on its own for now. It has reported increased earnings for 28 consecutive quarters, it is a market leader in most of its businesses, and its stock has steadily risen during Mr. David's six-year tenure.
Still, losing Honeywell was a blow. It would have doubled United Technologies' size, and given it the huge market capitalization that investors favor. And, it would have created an aerospace business that could have given G. E. some truly heavy competition. "We would have trumped G. E.'s ace," Mr. David said.
So, it was a setback, and a bad one. But at 58, Mr. David has managed to turn more than one apparent loss into a victory.
He was an executive with Otis Elevator when United Technologies took over that company in 1976, and he had expected to lose his job. "I was overtitled, overpaid and underexperienced," he said. Nonetheless, Mr. David rose to become United Technologies' president in 1992, and chief executive two years later.
It was no sinecure. Back then, United Technologies was a laggard by almost every measure. So Mr. David soon began the first of several restructurings, divesting ancillary businesses and slashing thousands of jobs. He pushed United Technologies into more global markets, dismantled its cumbersome headquarters staff and decentralized many management functions.
"He understood every facet of the business, from international currencies to complex technologies to the need to hire local managers abroad," said Alexander M. Haig Jr., who was president of United Technologies before becoming President Reagan's secretary of state in 1981.
Mr. David showed little emotion throughout the bloodletting, a fact that garnered him a reputation for coldness. But those who know him well say the coldness is a facade. "He dislikes all the trappings of false warmth," said Hubert Faure, a former Otis Elevator president who was Mr. David's first boss. "He shows his compassion in deeds, not words."
During that first round of downsizings, Mr. David instituted a program for paying dismissed employees to return to school. It has since expanded into a company-wide benefit. United Technologies pays tuition for employees, and gives them company stock if they graduate.
"His strong social conscience is almost unique among C.E.O.'s," said C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics, a Washington research concern. Mr. David's simple explanation: "I'm an education nut."
Mr. David's colleagues say he is constantly asking questions and sopping up answers. There are no hierarchical rules about who gets listened to. One example: Many of United Technologies' quality control systems are the brainchild of a Japanese manager Mr. David persuaded to move to Connecticut to fix the company's processes.
"He welcomes disagreement, he welcomes debate and he makes sure no one is afraid to speak up," said Martin Lipton, a partner with the law firm of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Mr. David's legal adviser on acquisitions.
He is the same way about personal hobbies. "He's a sponge for the science involved in sailing," said Thomas A. Whidden, president of North Marine Group and an occasional sailing partner of Mr. David's. "There's no question he's in charge on that boat, but he listens to all the people around him."
The love for learning is rooted in Mr. David's childhood. His father, a history professor, was 58 years old when he was born. "You don't chuck baseballs with a dad that age," Mr. David said. "Ours was an intellectual household."
TILL, Mr. David was anything but a pure intellectual in his younger days. As a physics and chemistry major at Harvard University, he was more interested in his motorcycle than his studies, and his grades showed it. After his second year he took a year's leave -- at Harvard's request -- and worked as a technical writer in New York City. He came back, and aced the last two years. He went on to get an M.B.A. from the University of Virginia's Darden School.
Mr. David, by then married to his high school sweetheart Barbara Osborn -- they were divorced in 1997 and have three children -- joined the Boston Consulting Group. One of his first clients was Otis Elevator; Mr. Faure hired him.
Somehow, Mr. David, who lives in West Hartford, Conn., and has a condominium in Vermont, finds time to sail, ski and cook -- a favorite way of entertaining friends. But plain, ordinary relaxing is not Mr. David's forte. Earlier this year he cracked five ribs when he went over a hidden rock on a particularly difficult ski slope. Cruising rather than competing in his sailboat? "Boring," is his response.
He even finds a way to inject frissons into cooking. "I like to make souffles," he said. But doesn't he know that fallen souffles plague even the finest cooks? He gives the expected answer: "I like the challenge."

Been Up So Long It Looks Like Down

BYLINE: By GEORGE JAMES

DATELINE: MILLBURN

 BODY:
Two empty stores loom like bookends at either end of town. Sandwiched between the two properties -- where a Saks and a Marsh jewelers once sold costly clothing and trinkets -- are eight vacant storefronts along a one-block stretch of downtown.
"Millburn-Short Hills is one of the most affluent communities in the country," said Steve Suskauer, a longtime merchant in this Essex County community where Wall Street executives and other professionals think little of putting down $3 million for a home. 
 The gaps along the main commercial street -- like spaces in the mouth of a Halloween pumpkin -- have led many residents to question why one of the wealthiest towns in a state with the second-highest per capita income in the country after Connecticut gives an after-the gold rush appearance rather than one of a tony town putting on its best face during a period of enormous economic prosperity.
On most weekend afternoons in downtown Summit, just to the west, shoppers can barely find a seat at Starbucks; drivers have to thread their way through the upscale shopping district a few times before finding a parking space.
In South Jersey, there are towns like Haddonfield, a borough with a mix of Victorians and many older homes, landscaped lawns and historic buildings, which advertises its downtown as place with "shopping the way it used to be."
And Maplewood, Millburn's more down-to-earth neighbor to the east, also has a thriving downtown.
But in Millburn, with a vacancy rate of more than 5 percent, the highest in five years, the overall effect in the compact business district is not good.
"For people driving through the community," said Mr. Suskauer, owner of David Gary Ltd., a fine arts shop, and president of the Downtown Millburn Development Alliance, "seeing some stores empty three years or more on one particular corner creates a poor image."
Where some see vacancies -- and an odd abundance of hair and nail salons and ice cream parlors -- Mayor Elaine Becker sees the "perception" of a troubled downtown. "I think that the town is thriving quite well," Ms. Becker added.
Perhaps her sense of well-being owes mainly to the Mall at Short Hills -- with a vast array of upscale shops and department stores -- which is a sure cure for any town in need of property tax revenue.
To some degree, the vacancies revive memories of the early 1990's, when the newly opened mall drained business and pockmarked the commercial district with empty storefronts. Lord & Taylor a longtime presence on Millburn Avenue, the main business thoroughfare, relocated to another nearby mall in Livingston, and there were almost two dozen vacancies downtown, Mr. Suskauer recalled.
But in 1992, merchants in a six-block area of downtown Millburn created a special improvement district, taxing businesses within the zone to finance improvements and services.
As a result, by 1995 the vacancy rate had dropped off to about 4 percent. Business continued to pick up as the district, known as Downtown Millburn Development Alliance, sought out new business. On the former Lord & Taylor property, for instance, a Fresh Fields Whole Foods Market opened, as well as a pharmacy and a home-furnishings store that subsequently pulled out.
But the vacancy rate downtown, which has 173 retailers, is back to more than 5 percent. About nine stores, including S. Marsh & Sons Jewelers, have gone empty. Marsh, in town since 1971, was taken over in recent years by Fortunoff, which closed the store earlier this year.
On a nine-acre site in the Short Hills section of Millburn Avenue -- outside the improvement district -- the former Saks has been vacant since the store relocated to the mall. The building is actually in neighboring Springfield, though the entrance is in Short Hills. Now it is a highly visible eyesore, and plans for a supermarket there have been in litigation for years because the towns say the added traffic would be a nuisance.
But the most noticeable vacancies -- 8 of 18 stores in a one-block stretch -- can be seen along Millburn Avenue between Main Street and Lackawanna Plaza, 6 of which are owned by Ramon Tublitz, a principal in Scotland Associates, a realty company in South Orange, and two by Jafir Tabib, a local merchant. One of the stores owned by Mr. Tabib and one owned by Mr. Tublitz are currently under lease.
Mr. Suskauer noted that the six properties owned by Mr. Tublitz have been vacant on and off for six years, though Carrie Lemerman, the executive director of the Chamber of Commerce, said she thought the vacancies went back as far 10 years.
Dean Shonts, who owns the Sneaker Factory on Millburn Avenue, echoed others in saying that Mr. Tublitz discouraged tenants from coming and, in other instances, from staying.
Mr. Shonts said that for 16 years he had leased one of the now-vacant stores before moving across the street 5 years ago. "He wanted me to move to one of his other stores and wanted to double my rent, which means I'd be paying twice what I am here," said Mr. Shonts. "He wasn't realistic at all. That's one of the reasons his stores have been empty."
In September 1999, another merchant here, Harold L. Rosen, who operated H. L. Rosen Gift Shop -- moved a property owned by Mr. Tublitz at Millburn Avenue and Lackawanna Place, where he had done business for 12 years. Mr. Rosen, who is 72, said he wanted a two-year lease, as he had negotiated in the past, because he was considering retirement. But he said Mr. Tublitz insisted on a five-year lease with a sizable rent increase. Mr. Rosen shut his doors.
"He's had a number of realtors who have represented him, people that specialize in retail space," Ms. Lemerman of the Chamber of Commerce said. "My understanding is that there's been a lot of interest in the properties over the years but when it comes time to doing the deal, it doesn't get done."
But Michael Mullen, a lawyer from Morristown who represents Scotland Associates, said many prospective tenants had inquired about the stores but few had made serious offers, possibly because they were concerned about competition from the mall and the strong downtown districts in surrounding towns.
"There are very real market forces driving this," Mr. Mullen said. "It's not a question of disinterest or a lack of commitment."
He also took issue with the less-than-generous descriptions of Mr. Tublitz offered by some local merchants. "My impression," he said, "is that the landlord is a lot more flexible and perhaps more compassionate than whatever the public persona or reputation might be in respect to tenants."
Representatives from the township, the business alliance and the chamber have met with Mr. Tublitz's representatives to express their concerns and offer assistance, but the vacancies persist. Mayor Becker, for one, said she met with Mr. Tublitz's lawyer several years ago, and as she put it, the meeting was "helpful."
"Some businesses did come in," Mayor Becker said. "Some were not successful. Unfortunately, they came and went. If there is a real problem there, I am not aware of what it is."
Still, officials remain optimistic about the future of the downtown here. Mr. Suskauer noted that the Marsh property was bought almost immediately after it closed by a Millburn developer, Pinnacle Communities, which was seeking planning board approval to open a retail and office complex.
Beth Peterson, executive director of Downtown New Jersey, a nonprofit organization in Summit that helps commercial business districts, said Millburn should be concerned about its vacancy rate, though it should be able to resolve the problem, "considering the underlying strength of the Millburn demographics."
"My basic thought," said Ms. Peterson, "is that the problem didn't get there overnight and it won't be solved overnight."

HEADLINE: DEVELOPMENT;
Nets, Mall or Sprawl?

BYLINE: By JOHN SULLIVAN

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
At a time when politicians are lining up to condemn sprawl and taxpayers are voting to spend millions of dollars to buy open land just ahead of developers with their front-end loaders, the last measure expected to pass through State Legislature was a bill easing the way for commercial development.
But that is what environmentalists are calling a measure approved last week by the Senate Economic Growth, Agriculture and Tourism Committee last week. The bill, which would provide public funds for projects like megamalls and amusement parks, is more conducive to sprawl than any measure the Legislature has seen in 10 years, said Jeff Tittle, executive director of the New Jersey Sierra Club. 
 Unlike most existing development laws, the bill -- which would use money from the state general fund to finance roads and utilities in new projects -- is not intended for the inner cities. Instead, it would allow any local government to apply for the funds on behalf of a developer.
As Mr. Tittle sees it, the bill will subsidize the development of huge new shopping centers in suburban and rural areas, and will draw business from the cities.
"This is going to promote sprawl and overdevelopment," he said. "This is pure subsidy. It is nothing more than corporate welfare at taxpayer expense."
But backers of the bill contend the environmental groups are overstating the intention and the power of the proposed legislation. Senator Joseph M. Kyrillos Jr., a Republican of Middletown a co-sponsor of the measure, said it would rarely be used, and then only for large regional projects.
Mr. Kyrillos said he proposed the law after meeting with representatives of the YankeeNets Corporation, which is trying to build an arena for the New Jersey Nets in the northern part of the state.
Although a spokesman for the YankeeNets Corporation said the company was not supporting the bill, Mr. Kyrillos said this type of public financing was needed for the project. And he predicted the Nets arena project would be the main reason legislators would support the measure.
"This is not going to happen very often because the threshold is so high," he said. "This is not for malls, it is for large-scale regional destination projects."
The bill has a long way to go before it becomes law, something the environmental groups insist is unlikely. It must first pass the Senate appropriations committee, then get through the Assembly and the Senate. A spokeswoman for Governor Whitman said she had not yet reviewed the measure.
According to the terms of the bill, developers have to invest at least $100 million to qualify for the state financing. If the local municipality and the state treasurer approve the project, state money can be used to pay for "infrastructure improvements" for the project.
However, the type of improvements seem somewhat uncertain; the bill says the improvements include roads and utilities. But while the bill says those are possible uses, it also says permitted uses of the money shall include, but not be limited to, roads and utilities.
The amount of financing would be based on the sales taxes the project was expected to generate. Environmental groups, including the Sierra Club and the New Jersey Public Interest Research Group, have said the bill would benefit large-scale developments like the Meadowlands Mills development in Carlstadt.
The Meadowlands project, at an estimated cost of nearly $1 billion, would include a shopping mall, light industrial development and a hotel near the Meadowlands sports complex. Environmentalists have opposed the project because of its possible effect on wetlands, and the regional office of the Environmental Protection Agency has recommended rejecting permits for several alternative plans.
But David Donofrio, a spokesman for the Mills Corporation of Arlington, Va., said his company supported the bill, which he noted could help several proposed developments.
Indeed, supporters of the legislation have pointed to other projects they say it would benefit. State Senator Robert W. Singer, a Republican of Jackson, said the Six Flags Great Adventure amusement park, which is in his district, has been debating whether to expand to year-round operations, and that the measure could help spur the company to make the investment.
Mr. Singer proposed similar legislation two years ago, but that bill was defeated.
"These are major projects, and corporations are going to decide whether to come to New Jersey or go somewhere else," he said. "They are not going to invest $100 million without the infrastructure to support it."
While a spokesman for Six Flags Inc., Brent Gooden, said the company had no involvement with the bill, he added, "We do indeed take into account the state and local support as it pertains to capital expansion."
State Senator Robert E. Schluter, a Republican from Flemington, cast the sole Economic Growth committee vote against the bill, saying it was unwise for the state to subsidize projects outside economically distressed areas because it would promote unneeded building and because it would take business from existing companies.
"The state is going to lose money, and there are going to be dislocations in terms of other businesses," Mr. Schluter said.
While the state has an interest in supporting projects that help inner cities or poor rural areas, he said that developments in other places should "be a market situation where the laws of supply and demand apply."
Dr. Joseph J. Seneca, an economics professor at Rutgers who is chairman of the governor's Council of Economic Advisors, said that New Jersey had already made a considerable effort to attract business, including several bills in the last few years specifically aimed at high-tech companies.
He said the incentives are best used to attract companies that would otherwise move out of the area, rather than those that would simply move within the state. He said regional moves were usually the most difficult for politicians because economically it mades little difference whether a business is on one side of a state border or another. Politically, however, the cost can be enormous, particularly when a project affects employment and sales tax figures for the state.
"There is a fairly compelling need to be competitive with other states," he said. "If there are attractive financial inducements in one state and not another, that will effect location decisions."
Curtis Fisher, executive director of the New Jersey Public Interest Research Group, said there was no reason to use state money to attract large retail developments, which are already attracted by New Jersey's large market.
"Growth should occur in areas of the state that can best handle it," he said. "I think New Jersey citizens would say in chorus, the last thing we need is another megamall."

HEADLINE: Untrendy Housing

 BODY:

To the Editor:
One group is invisible in your news article about a Lower East Side tenement (news article, Nov. 13). Along with the last century's immigrants and a wave of "trendsetters," there are lower-income tenants, barely maintaining their homes amid so-called neighborhood revitalization. 
 Some buildings considered "ripe for revitalization" already have residents, and many units are regulated. But the tactics of some new owners result in displacement and the loss of precious housing. Longtime tenants in regulated units are denied heat, gas or repairs, hit with frivolous evictions, threatened for organizing and, when worn down, offered small buyouts.
We should listen to all of the stories, protect regulated units and build affordable housing. Now that would be trendsetting.

HEADLINE: Changing Fields (and Lawns and Gardens)

BYLINE: By ELISABETH GINSBURG

 BODY:
THE gardening bug is an insidious disease. Once stricken, some victims feel a compulsion to spend all their free time digging in the dirt and all their money buying plants and seeds. Others go even further and transform their working lives by entering the horticultural field.
John Holm, a former professional chef, is in the midst of such a career transformation. Born in Norway to a family that owned a restaurant, he was trained as a cook from an early age. Mr. Holm eventually immigrated to the United States and found work at Manhattan restaurants like La Grenouille and Restaurant 44. He also taught cooking at the French Culinary Institute and helped found a successful prepared-food business. 
 While a chef, Mr. Holm began tending a container garden on the terrace of his Brooklyn Heights apartment. Eventually he moved to a 2.5-acre lot in Bedford, N.Y., and began growing things on a larger scale. He applied to the New York Botanical Garden's School of Professional Horticulture, a two-year program that combines course work with hands-on training in the botanical garden itself. He expects to graduate in 2002 and start his own residential landscape design business.
Training that combines horticulture's intellectual and practical sides makes perfect sense to Mr. Holm, who has a high tolerance for the unglamorous and unpaid work in the botanical garden. "Because of my background in cooking," he said, "I am used to working hard and getting dirty." But "I feel a passion for this that I never did for cooking," he added. "I went into cooking because of my family. This I did for myself."
Five years ago, Mary Squires was a corporate attorney living on Long Island. Then she and her husband moved to Upper Saddle River, N.J. After finding out what it cost to hire landscapers, she decided to design her new property herself -- even though she had little experience with plants. "I started researching before I put anything in the ground," she said. Her interest increased, and after she had become a regular at her local retail nursery, a clerk suggested she take some horticulture courses at Bergen County College.
She began her studies with two courses, including Plant, Soil and Science, one of the toughest classes in the two-year degree program. Eventually she became immersed in horticulture education and went to school full time. She received a certificate in landscaping and ornamental horticulture (with honors), and went on to earn an associate's degree in applied science.
With her degrees in hand, Ms. Squires hung out her shingle as a plant consultant, installing and maintaining gardens, doing soil tests and educating her clients about environment-friendly methods of dealing with garden pests.
Ms. Squires specializes in interior "plantscaping," helping her clients with selection and placement of indoor plants. On each job she uses a light meter to gauge the amount of light in specific indoor locations, so people avoid dark corners full of dying plants. This educated approach is something new for her. "In my past life," she said, "I would just buy a plant and water it."
Ms. Squires still does a limited amount of legal work, "just to keep my hand in." In addition to running her own business, she hopes to gain greenhouse management experience by working part time for a local nursery within the next year.
Ms. Squires has no regrets about trading case management for pest management. "The time that I spend in gardens is infinitely more rewarding than the most demanding legal case," she said.
Kathleen Nelson of Gaylordsville, spends her spring, summer and fall days growing and selling perennials, a home-based business that she began when she made a midlife career change two decades ago. Busy outdoors during the growing season, she spends the winter writing copy for her plant catalog, doing bookkeeping and planning for the coming season.
Ms. Nelson grew up in "the swamps of northern Minnesota," collecting plants in the abundant wetlands. After obtaining a master's degree in zoology, she taught biology at Manhattan Community College. "I loved teaching," she said.
But in the mid-1970's, layoffs within the City University system left Ms. Nelson unemployed. A new job at the University of Bridgeport brought an unexpected bonus -- a husband. Ms. Nelson left teaching and entered professional horticulture at the age of 41, when she had her first child.
"The first couple of years, I didn't know what I was doing," she said. Her science background helped her learn quickly, and trial and error enabled her to make the decision to focus on retail rather than wholesale customers. Her business grew, bolstered by the surge in public interest in perennial plants around the time she started in the 1980's.
Ms. Nelson specializes in shade plants, noninvasive grasses and deer-resistant species, which also feature in her landscape designs for a small number of clients.
As her business has flourished, Ms. Nelson's environmental concerns have grown. A stint on a local wetlands commission changed her focus to promoting native plants. Though natives are enjoying something of a renaissance, she thinks they need more exposure.
Ms. Nelson's child is now a college junior, and the second career continues to evolve. Though she gives occasional lectures, she said that a return to the classroom would be "emotionally draining." Running her small nursery, said Ms. Nelson, is the perfect combination of physical and intellectual activity.
That combination also appeals to Laura Leach, who made the switch to horticulture after 15 years as a sales, marketing and development executive. Like Mr. Holm, Ms. Leach, who lives in Hastings, N.Y., is now a student in the New York Botanical Garden's horticulture school.
Ms. Leach, who was born in England, has a love of gardening that she inherited from her mother and grandmother. In high school she considered a horticultural career, but chose other options.
After leaving school, Ms. Leach re-encountered horticulture when she took a marketing job with Britain's National Trust, which oversees many historic structures and gardens. Later she worked as the director of development for the Welsh National Opera.
As with Ms. Nelson, marriage helped propel Ms. Leach into a new life. Several years ago, she and her husband immigrated to California, where she began part-time horticultural studies. The following year the couple moved to the East Coast. She had discovered the botanical garden's program on the Internet, and chose it because it provided "the opportunity to work alongside the best horticulturists." She praises the program's diversity. "Today I am preparing seeds for a seed exchange; yesterday I was climbing an oak tree to prune it," she said.
When she graduates in the spring of 2002, Ms. Leach may work as an administrator for a horticultural institution. She also plans to continue her education in landscape design. But she is also keeping her options open. "I am looking at where my skills are," she added.
Ms. Leach had advice for those considering a similar career change. "It's important to have some practical experience in the field first," she said, noting that the botanical garden program requires such hands-on work as a prerequisite for admission.
And, while a horticultural career may ultimately provide those who choose it with time to stop and smell the roses, she advised anyone approaching the field to be "realistic, not romantic."

HEADLINE: Yesterday's Technology, Ready for the Future

BYLINE: By JIM MOTAVALLI

 BODY:
WHAT is more up to the minute than a hybrid-powered car? Or is it, what is more old-fashioned?
The concept actually originated at the dawn of the automobile. In the early 1900's, Ferdinand Porsche, the influential German designer, built a hybrid that used an internal-combustion engine to spin a generator that sent power to electric motors in the wheel hubs. The car was said to be capable of traveling 38 miles on battery power alone. 
 Another curiosity was the Gas-au-Lec, produced in 1905-06 by the Vaughn Machine Company of Peabody, Mass. The company's ambitious president, Hamilton S. Corwin, thought that the public would flock to buy what his advertisements called "the simplest gasoline car in the world." The 4-cylinder, 45-horsepower car boasted an auxiliary electric motor (connected to the driveshaft) that started the car without a crank and offered extra power for reverse gear and hill climbing. Despite these innovations, the Gas-au-Lec was a failure, with no more than four cars produced.
Another failed hybrid was the Woods Dual Power Coupe, whose electric motor powered the car up to 20 m.p.h., when a 4-cylinder gas engine took over. It was produced in Chicago around 1916-18.
Woods had produced electric cars since 1899, and it built an earlier hybrid in 1905-07. The Dual Power was said to have worked well, but few were sold; at nearly $3,000, it was relatively expensive and its fuel economy counted for little at a time of cheap gasoline. One surviving example sits on shredded tires in the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles. JIM MOTAVALLI

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL/Toyota Prius;
It's Easier to Be Green

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
TOYOTA executives describe their Prius as a "real car." While that might sound like damning a product with faint praise, it is actually a compliment for an alternative vehicle.
And they are right. The Prius, a so-called hybrid that uses both gasoline and electric power, avoids most of the drawbacks and inconveniences of other vehicles that are designed to be clean and fuel-efficient. Its emissions are among the lowest of any car on the road, and its fuel economy -- 48 miles per gallon in combined city and highway driving -- is second only to that of the Honda Insight, another hybrid. 
 While the $20,450 price is high compared with conventional gasoline cars of similar size, the Prius is still, to my mind, the first truly practical and affordable family car that uses, at least in part, electric power.
As such, the Prius, which went on sale in the United States this summer, is a forerunner of a whole breed of hybrid gas-electric vehicles due to appear from virtually all carmakers in the next few years.
Until now, much of the effort to cut automobile emissions, particularly in California, has centered on fully electric vehicles. While such cars have no tailpipe emissions, they can cost $20,000 more to manufacture than a like-sized gasoline car. And they can travel only 50 to 100 miles or so before the batteries need a lengthy recharging.
Drivers of hybrids like the Prius and Insight do not have to recharge the batteries because that is done automatically as the car is in motion, with power drawn from the gasoline engine and from recapturing the energy of braking, which would otherwise be wasted as friction.
When the car is stopped at a traffic signal, the gas engine shuts down, conserving fuel. And at low speeds, when gas engines are inefficient, the battery does the work. But when the car speeds up, the gas engine takes over. When the car accelerates, the battery kicks in to give the gas engine a boost. (In contrast, the Insight relies mostly on its gas engine, with the electric motor providing a boost when needed.)
Since most of the fuel is saved when the car is idling or moving slowly, the Prius is unusual in that it gets better mileage in the city (52 m.p.g.) than on the highway (45 m.p.g.), according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
The Prius, which is pronounced PREE-us and comes from the Latin meaning "to go before," was the world's first mass-produced hybrid vehicle; it has been sold in Japan since 1997. But Honda beat Toyota to the American market with its Insight, which also sells for around $20,000.
The Insight achieves an eye-popping mileage rating of 61 m.p.g. in town and 68 on the highway, but it has limitations. For now, it comes only with a manual transmission and two seats. And it has a tapered, space-age look that draws stares, for better or worse.
The Prius, which is made in Japan but was re-engineered for American driving conditions, sacrifices some fuel economy for practicality. It has an automatic transmission that is continuously variable, rather than having a discrete number of gears. Four adults and a five-year-old in a child seat fit reasonably comfortably. And from the outside, the Prius looks pretty much like a normal subcompact.
One drawback is that the batteries reduce cargo space. The trunk barely held a child's bicycle with training wheels. Also, acceleration is a bit sluggish. The Prius, which has a 1.5-liter engine, goes from 0 to 60 in a little over 12 seconds, compared with about 10 seconds for a Toyota Echo, which also has a 1.5-liter engine (but no electric backup).
Then there is the price. Toyota has lost money on each Prius it has sold, although executives now say the company is breaking even. Even so, the Prius sells for about $4,000 more than a Corolla and at least $6,000 more than the Echo.
Don't count on making up for that in lower gasoline bills. Fuel costs for the Prius will run only about $200 a year less than for the Corolla and Echo, according to the E.P.A. At that rate, it would take decades to recoup the higher purchase price.
This calculation, of course, does not take into account the savings to society from less air pollution -- and the tax breaks intended to reward buyers of cars like this. Prius owners could be eligible for a federal deduction of up to a $2,000 from their gross income, Toyota says.
Driving the Prius is like driving a regular car: just press the pedal and the car goes. The switch from electric to gasoline power is virtually seamless and imperceptible. The one difference is the gas engine's shutting off at a red light, leading novice drivers to conclude, instinctively, that the engine has stalled. It hasn't, of course, and when the accelerator is depressed the car immediately starts up and begins moving.
Then there is the dashboard. The shift lever protrudes somewhat oddly from the dash to the right of the steering wheel. This takes some getting used to, and I found the lever obscured my view of the radio controls.
More important is a small touch screen that displays how the power is flowing within the car, using arrows and pictures of the gas engine, the wheels, the battery and the motor. The arrows change as the vehicle shifts from electric to gas power, and from draining to recharging the battery.
The display can also show a bar graph of the most recent fuel economy, though I wonder how reliable the figures are. On one trip along a major boulevard here, I recorded 35 m.p.g. for one 5-minute segment and 100 m.p.g. for the next.
In Southern California's bumper-to-bumper freeway traffic, I also registered as much as 100 m.p.g. because the car was operating mainly on the battery. But after about 10 minutes of this, the battery was half-depleted and the gas engine kicked in.
Over all, according to the car's calculation, I averaged 43.5 m.p.g. in about 300 miles of mixed highway and city driving, somewhat below the E.P.A. rating.
Although they welcome hybrids, environmentalists say the ultimate goal should be zero-emission vehicles. Hybrids, after all, drive as well as gasoline cars because they are, in the main, gasoline cars, and they still emit some pollution.
The E.P.A. estimates that a Prius driven 15,000 miles a year will emit 4 tons of greenhouse gases, mainly carbon dioxide. While that is well below the 5.5 tons a year, or more, from small gasoline cars like the Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla, it is still not zero. As for smog-causing emissions like nitrogen oxides, the Prius is a super-ultra-low-emission vehicle, or SULEV, under California rules. That is the best rating short of zero, and it means the Prius's emissions are a tiny fraction of those from most cars. But the SULEV rating has also been achieved by special versions of the gasoline-only Honda Accord EX and Nissan Sentra CA.
Automakers say it is more effective to use hybrids to get a modest reduction in pollutants across a wide range of vehicles than to strive for zero-emission vehicles that no one will buy. The Prius is a case in point. Toyota expects to easily meet its target of 12,000 sales in the first year; orders are already backed up for months. That is several times the total number of fully electric vehicles sold or leased over several years.
The California Air Resources Board, after a summer of intense lobbying, decided to stick with its mandate requiring zero emissions from 10 percent of the cars sold by major manufacturers in the state in 2003. Some hybrids would get partial credit toward that goal, but 4 percent of sales would have to be of true zero-emission cars.
Still, while the Prius may not be the ultimate pollution solution, for those wanting to make a contribution here and now, it is the most practical way to go.

HEADLINE: WEDDINGS: VOWS;
Heidi Smith and Daniel Aronson

BYLINE: By LOIS SMITH BRADY

 BODY:
FRIENDS describe Heidi Medney Smith, 37, as a diehard Brooklynite. She has ridden almost every Brooklyn-bound subway line to the end just to see what was there. She loves ethnic food and cannot stay calm in a traffic jam or in the wilderness. "Heidi was raised in Flatbush by Dodger fans," said Elizabeth Hollander, a friend. "She's very fast and very bossy. She's full of life and speed and intensity and impatience."
After graduating magna cum laude from Wellesley College, Ms. Smith followed some friends to San Francisco, where she became a founder of a revival movie theater called the Red Victorian. She stayed in San Francisco for 11 years, but never stopped missing Brooklyn. "My true nature is to honk at the person in front of me in traffic, and I don't see the virtue of deep breathing my way out of it," she said. 
 When she came back in May 1998, it was because her mother, Claire Medney Smith, who was the president of Harold Ober Associates, the literary agents in New York, had become seriously ill. Her mother died that summer.
"It was very surprising, if terminal cancer can ever surprise you," Ms. Smith said. For more than a year afterward, she said she often stared at the wall of her tiny downtown apartment, unemployed and unsure about what direction to take with her life. "I would go out to the counters at the MAC make-up store and say, 'I have no foundation in my life, but I'll take some foundation on my face.' "
She decided to try graduate school. Last November, as she was filling out applications, she got a call from Daniel Alex Aronson, a sometime date from her San Francisco days. "She was about to go to social work school, and she was saved by the bell," said Erin St. John Kelly, another friend.
Ms. Smith and Mr. Aronson had known each other since the 1980's, dated briefly in 1996 (no chemistry, she recalled) and went their separate ways. "Am I allowed to say I hadn't really thought about him much over the years?" she said.
He, however, had never stopped thinking about her. Having grown up in Great Neck, N.Y., he always saw her as a kindred spirit on the West Coast. "Heidi is eloquent and interesting and challenging," said Mr. Aronson, 38, an Internet engineer and entrepreneur. "One problem about San Francisco is you don't find yourself up at 2 a.m. in a bar or coffee shop having a fascinating conversation with someone. I knew I could find that in Heidi anytime."
He tracked her down, flew East and took her to dinner.
"He was a man with a mission, really," Ms. Smith said. "He knew what he wanted, and all of a sudden it occurred to me that it was me."
After dinner, they went for a walk on the Brooklyn Heights Esplanade. "It was very cold," she said. "So we had to start kissing right away."
As he was starting up Campsix, a San Francisco company that gives technical and financial aid to new Internet ventures, she walked around New York, often in snowstorms, talking to him on her cell phone, gradually coming out of her mourning. By February, they were talking about marriage.
"He's very steady," said Ms. Smith, who is back on the West Coast and working as a counselor for the San Francisco Tenants Union. "You can huff and puff, and you cannot blow Dan down. And I huff and puff whenever I can. I feel everything quite deeply."
Ms. Smith came back to Brooklyn to marry on Nov. 11, in the Hall of the Americas at the Brooklyn Museum of Art. Instead of being overexcited and wearing sneakers, as some of her friends expected, she was serene and wore pumps.
"Last weekend, Dan called me and said, 'What are you doing on your last Saturday as a single person?' " Ms. Smith said.
"I said, 'I'm eating curried goat.' And he said, 'Well, I'm cleaning the house, so I guess we're ready to be married.' "

HEADLINE: It's Hopping in the Lobby As Hotels Party All Night;
Innkeepers are turning lounges, bars and everything between, not excluding the elevators, into a club scene.

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

 BODY:
IT'S Saturday night, and amid a swirl of Fendi baguettes, lip-gloss reapplication and leather pants, two polite, middle-aged women from rural Kentucky are standing in the lobby of the Hudson hotel, beaming like julep-happy Derby winners.
The two women, Marylyn Todd and Jane Warren, after all, have just emerged from the Library Bar, described by no less a source than Ms. Warren's son (who got them the room) as "a real 'in' place." 
 And indeed, the evidence is everywhere in the bar -- in the drinks (cosmopolitans, of course) as in the decor (the regal-purple pool table) and the clientele, which on this night includes Larry Johnson, the New York Knicks' power forward, who is engaged in, no kidding, a serious game of chess.
Mr. Johnson, entrenched in a knotty middle game, hardly looks up as groups of fetching library science majors and chess hotties titter about the relative star power of Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller. (Both of whom are in attendance, though neither is man enough to take on Mr. Johnson's vaunted Caro-Kann Defense.)
In the Hudson's lobby meanwhile, other attractive night-trippers shuttle between the high-ceilinged library and the hotel's second lounge, the thumping, low-ceilinged Hudson Bar, leaving a hazy trail of cigarette smoke and martini spill.
None of which, however, seems to faze the two visitors from Sebree, Ky. (population, 1,510). "This is our New York moment," Ms. Warren says. "And all we had to do is come to the lobby."
A recent sweep of Manhattan hotels found a full-blown club scene raging in a number of lobbies, engineered by aggressively hip innkeepers like Ian Schrager, who owns the Hudson. Rarely has the act of checking into the Econ-o-Lodge been so sexy: couples make out beside the concierge desk, disc jockeys spin hip-hop, herds of unshaved men and flocks of high-heeled women greet the nightly drop-ins. It's as if those club-loving siblings Nicky and Paris Hilton were already running their family's business, complete with guest lists and velvet ropes.
In addition to the Hudson's hectic scene, the soaring eight-story atrium of a downtown newcomer, the TriBeCa Grand Hotel, is a gathering place where patrons have engaged in elevator races after $12 cocktails, and the W, on Lexington Avenue and 50th Street, packs a crowd four-deep at the bar from happy hour to after midnight on Fridays and Saturdays.
Other cities have witnessed the hotel-as-nightclub phenomenon in recent years, notably Miami Beach and Los Angeles, even Stockholm. And New York has its precedents like Mr. Schrager's Paramount hotel, where a decade ago the overflow from the cozy Whiskey Bar nightly spilled into the lobby.
But the current scene is bigger and more overtly clublike than ever. It draws hundreds of patrons into designer lairs and runs late into the night. With the 1,000-room Hudson, which opened last month, Mr. Schrager has supersized the concept, unapologetically aiming to turn the hotel's public spaces into as big and celebrity-besotted a club as possible.
He hired a younger generation of clubland aficionados like Zoe Casavetes, who advises about entertainment, and Ben Pundle, late of Lot 61, who manages the Hudson Bar. A nonstop string of post-movie-premiere parties have been booked into the hotel, followed by the predictable mentions in gossip columns. All this has granted Mr. Schrager his wish: a perception that his new hotel is where the action is.
"Everybody likes to be in the know, and everybody wants to go to a bar that is happening," Mr. Schrager, formerly of Studio 54, said the other day in a mile-a-minute Brooklyn brogue. "So why not have those things in the lobby?"
The reaction of overnight guests to the scenes taking place in their midst seems mixed. Besides happily wide-eyed tourists enjoying their New York moments, there are also miffed guests like the latter-day Willy Loman who was waiting to check into the W recently. Sulking in a brown trench coat, Mr. Loman (not his real name) looked over the lobby crowd the way the Grinch looks at Whoville. "I've been to the bar before, but I've never stayed at the hotel," he said. "Now I know why."
The hotel-clubs seem to have more employees assigned to serving drop-ins than to working the registration desk. On one recent Friday, the staff at the TriBeCa Grand included two black-swaddled doormen outside and an all-blond three-woman team at the lounge's maitre d'hotel station. A single registration clerk filed her nails and looked on.
The point of it all is to make the hotel the destination. So, without leaving home, I took a short trip to some of the hotter hotel haunts to determine whether they are places to go, places to stay or places to avoid entirely.
THE first stop was the Church Lounge, which was opened in May at the TriBeCa Grand, a younger sister to the four-year-old SoHo Grand. While the SoHo Grand's second-floor bar, with its giant man-eating lamps and bare bulbs, has mellowed with middle age, the Church Lounge is still at that awkward stage of youth.
Physically, the lounge is lovely, a spacious kidney-shape room with a V-shape bar, lots of tables and a big back room outfitted with a Cadillac-size mirror. The John Portman-style atrium, too, is impressive, with glass elevators zipping up to a blue-tinted dome. On the two nights I visited, however, the large crowd seemed still unsure of itself, like a teenagers waiting for a party to start.
It's a hesitancy that highlights one of the innate dangers of hotel scenes, that creeping sensation that you're not in a real bar, a sense that a friend described as "the feeling that everyone's waiting for a taxi to the airport."
Unnerved, we attacked the problem with one of the hotel's specialty cocktails, which we quickly found cost exclusively in the $12 to $15 range -- another pitfall of the hotel scene, where prices are scaled for those with expense accounts.
Still, there were plenty of seats, and an attractive clientele. The scene was skewed toward singles, with all-male and all-female parties eyeing each other from afar. The age range was roughly 25 to 35, although I should note I counted no fewer than seven guys with shaved heads -- in this context, a camouflage for baldness, not a sign of a skinhead movement below Canal Street. There didn't seem to be any hotel guests; an informal poll of about a dozen people found none at all.
Not that they weren't trying. A visitor named Christopher tipped me off to the final challenge in hot hotels. He had spent all evening talking up a pretty blonde at the bar, finally suggesting that they retire someplace a little less public.
"We tried to get a room," Christopher said. "But the whole place is booked."
How the TriBeCa Grand holds up as a scene has yet to be determined. But for anyone looking for an example of the half-life of a design-driven destination hotel, there is no finer artifact than the Whiskey Blue bar at the W, the first of a chain of W Hotels in New York, which opened in 1998.
The bar has everything you've seen everywhere else: amber lighting and curtains (a la Moomba), black and white photos (a la the late Orient) and little white table candles (a la every other bar in the city). The music, too, is predictable, a steady stream of disco and hip-hop. Wonderbra-wearing waitresses maneuver through shoulder-to-shoulder suits, businessmen who apparently come prepared with the kind of pickup lines distributed wholesale in fraternities across the country.
"Did I tell you I'm a marathoner?" said one man, making eyes at a woman in an apron top.
"You run?" she responded.
"Yes," he answered. "I run marathons."
And so on.
Perhaps the only original flair in the Whiskey Blue is a comfy bed in the middle of the room, on which two middle-aged men -- ties off, it's quittin' time! -- were lounging, along with a young woman who looked as if she had just lost her trust fund.
For all that, there was a sizable line out front, with a stream of taxis and white limousines pulling up. Inside, the bar was packed to capacity. A doorman near the coat check was strict: patrons who left to go to the bathroom, which requires leaving the Whiskey Blue and climbing one flight upstairs, found it difficult to regain entrance.
Those locked out, mind you, could find refuge in the Oasis Bar, a more casual two-level establishment adjacent to the front desk, where visitors sat behind small wooden tables that have backgammon boards and chessboards burned into their tops. (Note to Mr. Johnson: chess doesn't seem to be big at the W.)
It was into this scene that we stumbled on a rainy Thursday evening. Moving through the crowd at a snail's pace, we found ourselves seated at a crowded table occupied by a likable young man named William, who said he was a regular at "the Blue" on Thursdays.
"I go here for the girls," said William, who is 28 and a Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, native. He didn't want to give his last name because his girlfriend might not approve. He added with a shout over the music: "It's easy to talk to people. You know, talk business."
Carlo Dibetetto, William's friend, agreed. "The girls here are from all over the place," he said. "Boston, Jersey, Long Island, all over."
Mr. Dibetetto, 48, said he was an actor and as proof took out of his pocket a snapshot of him and the actor Joe Viterelli, Robert DeNiro's glacierlike sidekick in the movie "Analyze This." Mr. Dibetetto said he came to the craft only recently, after working in "several businesses," and he added that the name of his current film project is, honest, "Wannabes."
"I love acting," he said. "It's like make-believe."
But the movie business, he said, has yet to translate into an active social life. So, Mr. Dibetetto, who said his wife had recently asked him to vacate their house, started coming to the Whiskey Blue to find "nice polite types of girls."
"It's hard to walk in and not walk out with nobody," he said. "That's what the girls come here for." He reflected for a moment and then added, "They come here to meet famous people, I guess."
Call it a hunch, but they may be in the wrong place.
For actual celebrity gawking, we traveled to the Hudson, on 58th Street, between Eighth and Ninth Avenues, where a nice fellow in a black trenchcoat who seemed to have stepped from "The Matrix" shooed us away from the front door.
All the hotels say their guests are given preference in getting in, and at the Hudson only hotel guests are allowed to enter through the main doors -- a tomblike facade bathed in neon the color of green sherbet -- while outsiders are diverted to a small side door.
Around that door we found a messy clump of people, all umbrellas and insistent tones. One woman said she was there to meet three fellow bachelorettes. (She made it in.) Another claimed to be from The New York Observer. (She might still be waiting.)
Past the ropes, a dull stairway leads to the second floor and into the Hudson Bar, where the ceilings loom low, decorated by a swirling mural by Francesco Clemente.
On this evening, when no publicity parties were scheduled, the room was only about half full. A D.J. spun loud dance tunes. The airy feeling of the room was intensified by the design, which includes floating candles in crystal bowls and translucent white tiles underfoot. People seemed to be making space near the center of the room for Jay Z and an entourage, who were slouched on low-slung couches.
Watching Mr. Z from a distance were those other musical innovators, the teeny-bopper group O-Town, which is the subject of the television documentary serial "Making the Band." The five musicians turned out to be the first people I met in any of my travels who were actually staying at the hotel where they were lounging.
The band was in town for a night to record a song. They usually stay at the W, the musicians said, but had chosen the Hudson because, well, they didn't know. But they were unusually qualified to compare the two establishments.
"This seems very foreign to me," said Ashley Parker Angel, the "blond one" in the band.
"Like Germany," said Trevor Penick, the "bad one."
"Or England," said Erik-Michael Estrada, the "cute one."
"Yeah," Mr. Angel said.
Yeah.
All else aside, the band seemed mighty grateful for a place to go. "To tell the truth," Mr. Penick said, "if we are in a hotel where nothing's going on, we don't do anything."
Mr. Estrada agreed.
"Yeah," he said, "we don't really like to take cabs."
"So," chimed in Mr. Penick in perfect harmony, "if it's not happening downstairs, it's not happening."

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW;
The Politics Of Surplus Cut Across Partisanship

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
TO the extent that there is any conventional wisdom left in the nation's capital, it is that the next four years will be defined by gridlock, with neither party having the votes in Congress or the mandate to enact much of an agenda.
That will no doubt prove true in many respects. The prospects for a bipartisan agreement on shoring up Social Security, for example, are dim. 
 Yet it is a mistake to assume that gridlock means that fiscal policy will be frozen and that the mounting federal budget surpluses will go, by default, to reducing the national debt.
The reason is that surplus politics are proving to be guided by wholly different rules from those that defined the long era of budget deficits.
When money was tight in Washington, a standoff meant that neither side got what it wanted. Now we are beginning to learn that when priorities clash in an era of plenty, Washington's solution is to give both sides some, if not all, of what they want.
Put aside for a moment the outcome of the presidential race and look at what the outgoing Congress and President Clinton were up to before Election Day.
Without much debate, the Republican leadership and the White House had generally agreed on a package of tax cuts and spending increases that would have eaten up about $900 billion of the projected budget surplus over the next decade. That is about 40 percent of the anticipated non-Social Security surplus of $2.2 trillion over that period -- the same money the presidential candidates were counting on for their proposals.
That budget deal appears to have fallen apart, for reasons unrelated to the amount of money involved. It may be pieced back together when the lame-duck Congress returns after Thanksgiving, but even if it is not, the principle has been well established: the surplus is a remarkably effective political lubricant.
The same dynamic will no doubt apply over the next four years. While Republicans and Democrats will pick ideological fights with each other to motivate their supporters for the midterm elections in 2002 and the next presidential race in 2004, they will also continue to dole out the goodies made affordable by the surplus.
"Compromise is as easy as 'you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours,' " said Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at Hoenig & Company in Rye Brook, N.Y.
Dividing up the surplus will be made easier by two factors: the near-certainty that the surplus projection will be revised upward again, and the likelihood that the economy has slowed to a point where fiscal stimulus would no longer have to be offset by higher interest rates.
The projection from the Congressional Budget Office is for a surplus over the next decade of nearly $4.6 trillion, of which about $2.4 trillion would come from excess Social Security revenue. The two parties agree that the Social Security surplus should go to reducing the $3.4 trillion national debt or back into the retirement system.
Early word among budget analysts on Capitol Hill is that the budget office's next projection in a few months will add anywhere from several hundred billion dollars to $1 trillion to the 10-year projection. Most of the additional money would fall into the non-Social Security category, and therefore, be available for tax cuts or new spending.
Should the Fed decide to cut interest rates next year to pep up a slowing economy, as some economists predict, it would also remove the argument that fiscal stimulus is the last thing the economy needs. The economic argument against spending the surplus has not been much heeded in Washington anyway, but a faltering economy would provide lawmakers with a justification for some old-style Keynesian pump-priming.
There are reasons why saving the surplus -- using it to accelerate debt reduction -- would be best for the nation. Paying off debt puts downward pressure on interest rates and frees capital for more productive uses.
Moreover, the population is about to get a lot older, driving up the costs of entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare. The United States would be in much better condition to weather that demographic shift if federal finances are in order.
But there are strong arguments for putting the surplus to work immediately, either through spending programs to address poverty, education, health and the environment, or through tax cuts that might promote higher rates of economic growth.
Washington has probably already committed itself to as much debt reduction as it can credibly promise. Count on politicians to find a way to agree, even across a deep partisan divide, on using all or most of the non-Social Security surplus on proposals that have a more immediate appeal.

HEADLINE: A NIGHT OUT WITH/Andre De Shields;
So Hot, He Needs 2 Stages to Do His Misbehavin'

BYLINE: By LINDA LEE

 BODY:
YOU representin', baby," a friend encountered in the lobby said to Andre De Shields as he left his apartment building, Manhattan Plaza, on West 43rd Street. And indeed he was, dressed in a black tailcoat with a pale blue diamond pattern and a plaid topcoat, on his way to two fund-raising galas Monday night.
What he was representing, however, was the hardest-working actor-slash-song-and-dance-man in Manhattan on his day off. He was not going to be sitting in the orchestra seats with the other swells. He was going to be onstage, upping the energy level as he does every night when he stops the show in "The Full Monty" on Broadway. And he was going to do it twice. 
 "In this industry you spend so much time being anonymous that when you're hot, you're hot," he said. At a well-preserved 54, Mr. De Shields is hot all over again. "There was a time I couldn't get arrested," he said. "And now I've hit pay dirt three times -- wait, four actually." To review, that would be when he played the title role on Broadway in "The Wiz" in 1975, when he starred as Viper in "Ain't Misbehavin' " in 1978 and now as Horse in the stage version of "The Full Monty." (The fourth would be his Tony nomination for playing Jester in "Play On" in 1997.)
But there was a 20-year period in there when perhaps he couldn't get arrested, and he filled his time with a master's degree in African-American studies, began teaching at New York University, did cabaret and turned up every year to perform at La Mama for Ellen Stewart.
Born one of 11 children to a tailor and his wife in Baltimore, Mr. De Shields speaks with the elegant diction of a professor of Shakespeare (which he now teaches at N.Y.U.) and adores $5 words to the point of puzzling those around him. ("Antipodal"?) But he has no problem playing an aging, unemployed manager of a fast-food joint from Buffalo who finds self-esteem through dancing and stripping in "The Full Monty." "I just don't enunciate as clearly," he said.
Mr. De Shields's song "Big Black Man," a sendup of James Brown, brings down the house and has led to talk of another Tony nomination. As Ben Brantley said in reviewing the show in The New York Times, Mr. De Shields, for the duration of his solo, "seems to own the whole island of Manhattan."
No problem there. What he was having a problem with Monday evening was finding the Ford Center for the Performing Arts on 42nd Street, only blocks from his home. There were spotlights splaying outside and a red carpet rolled out in front of the Sony E-Walk theater, and like any actor, he turned and walked right in. Whoops, it was the premiere of an HBO film. The Lena Horne Awards at the Ford Center, his destination, were farther down the block, with no red carpet but a lot more celebrities, hoopla and photographers jostling and flashing.
"It's that 'Full Monty' guy," someone in the crowd said helpfully to those who did not recognize Mr. De Shields.
"No," said Rosie O'Donnell, who was right behind him and was being honored that night, along with Quincy Jones. "It's that guy from 'The Wiz'!"
What she didn't know going in was that Mr. De Shields had sent over his costume from "The Wiz" and that if he could get into it, he was going to put it on and sing for her that night.
While everyone else went into the theater, he took a detour to the left, to the decidedly less glamorous part of the building, a warren of dressing rooms with paper signs taped to the doors saying things like "Stomp Cast" and "Betty Buckley."
"In 1987, I was performing and this zaftig girl with long black hair came up to me and said, 'Mr. Wiz!' 'Mr. Wiz!' " Mr. De Shields recalled. "And I was nice to her -- I'm nice to all my fans -- but little did I know that 10 years later I'd be trying to get her attention. Rosie O'Donnell, with her own talk show."
Through the years of fame and obscurity, Mr. De Shields has always been a New York theater actor, never going Hollywood. "I only go where I'm invited," he said. "And Hollywood hasn't beckoned." Roles for African-Americans are still constrained there, he said. "There's only one leading man, Denzel, and room for one character actor, Morgan Freeman, and one action hero, Wesley Snipes, and one buddy, Danny Glover."
If he ever did make a place for himself in Hollywood, he said, it would be as an African-American man with fine plumage. "I'm elegant, articulate, and I don't know if Hollywood is ready," he said.
But his 42nd Street audience was, and it was time to slither into his 25-year-old skintight Wiz costume. (When the show closed, he kept it, and has used it before on Halloween. But then he had to lie on a bed to get it on.)
Four people were in his dressing room, where only one needed to be, perhaps two, but Mr. De Shields didn't mind. Hey, this is a guy who began his professional career in "Hair" and who bares all every night in "The Full Monty."
"They don't call this 'The Half Monty,' " he said. "I guarantee you we are in our birthday suits." There is also a long scene they play in underwear. "Let me tell you something about men," Mr. De Shields said. "We'd much rather be seen buck naked than in our underpants, especially in a roomful of other men."
But there he was, stripping down to his dance briefs and beginning the strenuous work of getting into costume. First the long stretch legs of the white jumpsuit (shades of Elvis), then up to the waist -- unh! -- and then, but only with a slight backward bend at the waist, first one arm and then the other into the costume.
"Now comes the hard part -- zipping," he said.
Inch by inch the miracle was achieved. But wait. "Can you sew it for me?" he asked his publicist, Merle Frimark. "I brought a needle and thread." Remember, this is a tailor's son, and there, on his right side, was a gaping seam. "I don't want to break out of it up there onstage," he said.
They decided it would be prudent to unzip the top. Sewing done, stomach back in, standing taller, arms back, yes, he was zipped in again. "A few psilocybin mushrooms, and I'll be fine," he said. He put on the white platform boots.
Swirling down the hallway past Elaine Stritch, standing in her underwear in her dressing room (nice legs, Elaine!), then upstairs, and there was the stage. "This is an industry where you can exorcise your demons," Mr. De Shields said. "In any other industry, you're going postal. Here it's expected."
"So you wanted to meet the Wizard?" someone asked the crowd in the house, and Mr. De Shields was on. Really on. Strutting and singing and swirling. He ripped his cape off -- literally ripped -- and stepped out of it and gave the audience a good view of the glittering white star affixed to the rump of his taut jumpsuit. Gasps, a big finish, applause, applause, applause, and he was off.
"It's a calculated risk," he said, "to see if 25 years later, when you are clearly adult -- it's a calculated risk to come back and try it again." The calculation had paid off, but there was no time to preen. It was 8:20, and while the other performers were hanging around to take curtain calls later that night, Mr. De Shields had another appointment, uptown, to be onstage at 8:45.
Off came the costume, on went the tails again and he was out on 43rd Street looking for the car that would get him to Lincoln Center. A short ride and there he was, in his dressing room at Avery Fisher Hall for a gala for Jazz at Lincoln Center, with, what, five minutes to spare?
Now to switch hats from Broadway to Louis Armstrong. But wait. Where was Mr. De Shields's white handkerchief? You can't do Louis Armstrong without a white handkerchief, to mop your face and gesture with. One was found, and he roughed it up, to make it limp, so it would have the right drape over his hand. And on he went to do his patter and to sing "I'm Confessin' (That I Love You)." Right after him came Jessye Norman, singing "Nobody Knows the Trouble I've Seen," while Dr. John stood backstage and watched on a monitor.
Wynton Marsalis tootled his way into Mr. De Shields's dressing room for a hug. ("My man," he said.) It was 10 o'clock. Two shows were over. Mr. De Shields hadn't eaten all day, and he was expected at dinner across the plaza at the New York State Theater with the jazz patrons who'd paid $1,000 and up for gala tickets.
Is this man tired yet? Not a chance. He'd been up since 7 a.m., and had spent the morning at Actors Equity as a representative from "The Full Monty," going over a new union agreement with Broadway producers, then walked from there to the Ford Center for a rehearsal, took the No. 104 bus up to Lincoln Center for the other rehearsal, then the No. 11 bus home to change for the evening.
"And," he said, "all along the way the universe was saying, 'Yes!' "

HEADLINE: How Easy Cash Became Hard Debts

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
IN a Nov. 2 report, "The Other Side of Leverage," Ravi Suria, a convertible bond analyst at Lehman Brothers, examined the consequences of the recent surge in debt at telecommunications companies at a time when intense competition for customers had reduced revenue growth. It is a sobering piece of research.
Mr. Suria began by pointing out that in the past four years, debt at a group of seven high-grade telecommunications companies, including AT&T, Verizon and SBC, exploded from $93 billion, to $210 billion, an annualized rate of almost 23 percent. At lesser-quality telecom and media services companies, like Global Crossing, Nextel Communications and PSI Net, high-yield corporate debt and convertible bond issuance ballooned to $275 billion, a compounded annual rate of 60 percent, in the period. 
 To put this binge into perspective, the entire value of high-yield debt issued between 1983 and 1990, the heyday of junk-bonds, was $160 billion.
These telecom companies took on such high amounts of debt to capitalize on the explosion in demand for data and voice communications services. Even the watchful Mr. Suria stressed in his report that the business remained highly promising.
So what's the problem? Too much of a good thing: These companies' capital structures now are simply too indebted for their cash flows to cover interest payments.
"The investment thesis for many of these firms was that, as they were nimbler and faster than the incumbents, they would quickly raise capital, build out networks with the latest technologies and then sell the completed networks to the large investment-grade telecom companies which needed the new assets," Mr. Suria wrote. Now, however, even the big companies are strapped for cash and are not in a buying mood.
This puts immense pressure on the speculative companies whose debt levels exceed the value of the plant and equipment they have sunk in their networks. For example, PSI Net has $4.6 billion in debt and preferred stock, more than double its $2 billion in net plant and equipment. Its interest expense and preferred stock dividends for the past 12 months totaled $400 million, compared to revenues of $1.04 billion. The company's net operating cash flow was a negative $241 million in the past 12 months.
PSI Net's stock reflects these difficult economics; it has crashed from $60.94 a share last March to $1.63. The company's bonds are fetching less than 40 cents on the dollar.
On Thursday, PSI Net announced that it had hired Goldman Sachs to help it explore its "financial alternatives."
But other speculative companies' stocks are still trading at fairly fancy premiums, even though their debts exceed the value of their hard assets. This suggests that those companies are bound to feel further pain, according to Mr. Suria.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
The Wall Street Bonanza That Won't Be

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
EVEN if the nasty partisan battle for the White House of recent weeks goes on to infect all of Congress next year, both parties agree on at least one thing: investing in stocks should be a part of any solution to the problem of funding Social Security in coming years. Naturally, all of Wall Street is agog over what such a shift to stocks might mean to the mood of the overall market. Bear markets, be gone!
Since investing in the stock market has become the national pastime, it is not surprising that Democrats and Republicans alike think expanding the Social Security trust fund to include stock investments would solve the system's ills. 
 And ills aplenty there are. In 1934, for example, there were 16 working Americans for each retired beneficiary. By 2030, this ratio is expected to have dwindled to two to one. And today 45 million people collect Social Security benefits of roughly $400 billion a year. In 30 years, analysts expect that 83 million people will collect over $750 billion a year, in today's dollars.
Since the trust fund's current value of $1 trillion does not come close to covering future obligations -- an estimated $3 trillion -- stocks look like a pretty appealing way out. And last year, Democrats in the House called for the Social Security trust fund to allocate between 40 percent and 50 percent to stocks.
With the broad market averages down significantly for the year, it is fun for Wall Street to fantasize about what $500 million flooding into the stock market would do to prop up prices. After all, that amount is roughly half the money that went into domestic equity mutual funds throughout the entire 1990's.
But Leah Modigliani, a United States equity strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, believes putting this money to work in stocks would be no bonanza for shares. And she thinks such a shift would drive interest rates considerably higher, which is nobody's idea of a good thing.
"We have to think carefully through the implementation of such a policy and consider the fact that if we sell bonds it means it's not new cash to the stock market," Ms. Modigliani said. "Also, the effect on the bond market could be quite significant."
Ms. Modigliani said that if the Trust liquidates $500 billion of the Treasury-backed i.o.u.'s that it holds, the Treasury would have to sell that amount of bonds in the open market. Given that the government bond market is currently around $2.5 trillion, $500 billion for sale is a big enough chunk to drive prices down -- and yields up -- significantly. "Bond yields will have to rise to entice investors, who were perfectly happy holding other assets, to buy bonds instead," Ms. Modigliani noted.
As yields rise, Ms. Modigliani argues, some investors will sell stocks to buy bonds. So the net amount going into the stock market will be far below the $500 billion allocated to equities.
Since higher bond yields will make it more expensive for American companies to borrow, their profits will be hurt too. Ms. Modigliani's conclusion?
"Selling government bonds to buy stocks is not nearly as beneficial to the stock market as it first appears," she said. "In fact, on the margin, we think such a transaction could actually be negative for stocks."
New Social Security receipts going into stocks would, of course, mean fresh money for the market. But with the value of the United States stock market at around $13.4 trillion, it is the $500 billion honey pot, not the new receipts, that excites Wall Street.
Wrongly, in Ms. Modigliani's view.
"At least in the near term," she said, "it is unlikely to be the windfall to the stock market that people think."

HEADLINE: Bond Believers See Prelude to a Fall

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
WHEN the bond market talks, investors don't always like to listen. After all, bond investors tend to spot bad news on the horizon and then telegraph it to the rest of the world in language as complex as Alan Greenspan's when he testifies before Congress.
But with the stock market in a swoon, investors looking for guidance are starting to heed the distress signals that the bond market has been sending up recently. And what some observers fear they see in these signs is a storm for the United States capital markets that may be tougher to recover from than the debacle in the autumn of 1998. 
 That year, a crisis was precipitated by the demise of one giant hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management. But after the Federal Reserve Board lowered interest rates, recovery came swiftly to the stock market and the economy was relatively unscathed. This time around, market observers say, the turbulence will be set off by many troubled companies buckling under the weight of excessive debt lent to them at the height of New Economy euphoria.
That scares the pinstripes off the pants of some who heed the bond market's signals. If worried investors continue to shun corporate bonds as they turn away from risk, many companies will find it impossible to raise the capital that leads to new job creation and continued economic growth. And since much of the economic growth in this nation over the past few years came from the big money spent by companies that had raised cash in the anything-goes bond market, the economy could slow quite sharply as the money spigots go dry.
Finally, as more and more companies go under, their woes could turn a soft economic landing into a much bumpier one. And the longest American expansion on record could come abruptly to an end.
Byron Wien, chief United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, sees little good in the signals the bond market is sending.
"One," he said, "the hard landing possibility for next year is more realistic than the stock market believes. Two, even if there is a soft landing, corporate fixed expenses have built up during this nine-year period of prosperity and will be hard to roll back, so that a minor shortfall in revenues will cause a major shortfall in profits."
The bond market's condition has implications for interest rate policy as well. "This is a murky picture and even contributes to a more difficult judgmental problem for the Federal Reserve," said Henry Kaufman, the Wall Street economist. Before the Fed can cut rates, he said, it must weigh the decline in credit quality against the need to get the market moving again.
The corporate debt market has grown enormously in recent years, expanding to accommodate the burgeoning capital needs of hundreds of companies. Although most investors focus on the stock market, the corporate bond market dwarfs it in size.
AND the gap is widening. So far this year, companies have raised only $146 billion from new stock issues, compared with $935 billion in the corporate bond market, according to Thomson Financial Securities Data. The peak of corporate issuance came in 1998 when $1.2 trillion worth of bonds came to market, up from $433 billion raised in 1995.
But lately, issuance has slowed considerably as the roster of troubled companies has started to swell. Just last Tuesday, ICG Communications, a telecommunications and internet service provider in Englewood, Colo., filed for bankruptcy. The company, whose stock had traded as high as $39 a share last March, had $2.2 billion in long-term bonds on its balance sheet before the bankruptcy.
And, to cite just one other example among many, on May 17, GST Telecommunications, a Vancouver voice and data services provider, declared bankruptcy. Although Time Warner bought its assets, it paid only 70 percent of the book value of the company's plant, property and equipment. That left just 50 cents on the dollar for bondholders.
As bond investors have digested those corporate difficulties, their appetite for risk has shrunk markedly. Many companies needing cash and willing to pay high interest rates for it have been out of luck. The total amount of money raised in high-yield bonds this year will probably be around half the $99.7 billion raised in 1999, according to Merrill Lynch. In October, only seven high-yield bond issues came to market, raising a total of $1.63 billion. In October 1999, 17 high-yield bond issues raised $3.3 billion from investors.
Meanwhile, the sickliness of the corporate bond market is also seen in the rising interest rates that high-yield issues must pay to attract investors. According to Merrill Lynch, such bonds now yield 13.34 percent, up from the 10.3 percent demanded by investors in September 1998, when Long-Term Capital Management was sinking and the capital markets stood still. And high-yield bonds are trading at yields that are almost 9 percentage points higher than comparable Treasury securities. The difference between those two yields is called the spread.
Today's high yields and high spreads suggest that investors realize that many companies issuing high-yield debt confront much greater risks than they faced two years ago. That is because in the crisis of 1998, even though one big participant was teetering, the overall balance sheets of most issuers remained healthy. Then, the underlying credit fundamentals of high-yield companies were better than they are now, according to Ravi Suria, the convertible bond analyst at Lehman Brothers who became famous for his in-depth and scathing report on Amazon.com last June (from which its stock never recovered). In a recent report on heavy debt among telecommunications companies, he argues that the market's current problems will be more difficult to emerge from. He said that is because the problems are tied to declining credit quality of underlying issuers that have continued to add leverage in the face of falling growth rates.
Diane Vazza, head of global fixed income research at the Standard & Poor's Corporation, agreed: "We are now in the 10th consecutive quarter where we have seen downgrades of corporate debt outpace upgrades. The last time we saw that was in 1990-1991, when we had 11 consecutive quarters of downgrades during a period of record defaults."
Some things are already worse. Last year, Ms. Vazza said, 89 companies with debt that was rated defaulted on $24.2 billion in securities; so far this year, 85 companies have defaulted on almost $24.7 billion of debt. In 1991, when the country was in a recession, 65 companies defaulted on $19.8 billion of debt.
Adding to the unease over the higher default figures of today, companies are defaulting on their bonds more quickly than they have historically. Mariarosa Verde, a director in the loan products group at Fitch, a bond rating company in New York, said: "We looked at defaults by issuance date and found that 84 of the 152 bonds that defaulted this year were issued in 1997 and 1998. That's 55 percent, which is very significant."
For most of the 1990's, high-yield issuers have defaulted in four years on average, not the two to three years that is becoming common. What these companies are running into, Ms. Verde said, is an unaccommodating market just when they need to refinance.
THERE'S another measure by which things appear worse today than in the recessionary period of 1990: how much lenders are recovering after a company emerges from bankruptcy. Robert J. Grossman, group managing director at Fitch, said his company had tracked recoveries made by lenders between 1991 and 1997. He found that lenders holding unsecured debt -- those that stand well back in the creditors' line -- got back on average 40 cents on the dollar invested.
But, in the past three years, unsecured lenders have received 23 percent less on average, or 31 cents on the dollar, because defaulters are so overextended. "The asset values just aren't there," Mr. Grossman said.
Perhaps the greatest surprise to bond investors has been the seemingly overnight collapse of the credit ratings of once high-quality corporations. "Coming out of left field, a number of investment grade companies like Xerox, J. C. Penney and Laidlaw fell off a cliff, going straight from investment grade to distressed," said Martin S. Fridson, chief high-yield strategist at Merrill Lynch.
Some investors fear that the woes of such former blue chips may signal a looming recession, but Mr. Fridson does not. He views the distressed state of the bond market to be the result of too much loose money chasing too many untested companies.
While the stock market partied heartily in recent years with hundreds of initial public offerings that shot straight into the stratosphere, the euphoria was even more evident in the high-yield bond market, where companies of questionable credit strength go for money to fund their operations. It has grown from $213 billion 10 years ago to $508 billion today, Merrill Lynch says -- far beyond the growth of the economy.
Naturally, as the market ballooned, so did the risks. Jack Hersch, a private investor in distressed securities in San Diego who ran research at M. J. Whitman, a New York investment firm, described the change in the junk bond market: "Ten years ago you had good companies with bad balance sheets, that were overleveraged. Very rarely did you have bad business models. Now in some sectors you have truly bad business models, poorly run companies that may have no reason to live."
Such speculation is one thing in the ephemeral world of dot-coms. It is another in an economic backbone sector like telecommunications, where most of the money needed for expansion has been raised in the high-yield bond market. According to Merrill Lynch, telecommunications bonds made up an astonishing 18.6 percent of the market on Sept. 30. The next industry group, cable television, had just 8.63 percent.
"The telecom area is venture capital masquerading as high-yield," Mr. Hersch said. "You had businesses that had good stories to tell and only future earnings to point to." Now, those earnings are in doubt.
Mr. Suria's report compares recent capital spending by telecom companies with spending on other large infrastructure programs in history -- railroads, highways, the telephone system and nuclear power plants. He notes that the enormous spending by telecom companies has never been done before in an unregulated, free-market environment.
This is significant because regulated industries like utilities, and monopolistic enterprises, like the railroads when they were built, can bank on guaranteed income from consumers that can be used to pay interest on the debt amassed to build the projects. But given the intense price competition in telecommunications, Mr. Suria wrote, lucrative cash flows from customers are no sure thing.
That makes many of these bonds precarious indeed.
The precipitous decline of technology stocks in recent months is also contributing to the high-yield bond market's woes. That is because investors who were willing to lend to speculative companies took some comfort in their holdings as long as these companies' stocks -- and overall market value -- were riding high.
"Through 1997, their franchise value or market value was growing and the future outlook for these companies was improving enough that they could add debt without it being too risky," said Allen J. Levinson, managing director of K.M.V., an analytical and advisory firm in San Francisco that specializes in credit risk. "Since then, many of these companies have continued to add debt at a consistent pace, but their market values have stopped growing or are growing at a slower pace. As a result, the market leverage of the companies has grown rapidly and so has their probability of default."
Mr. Suria is also troubled that other indebtedness that is not easily identified is growing at many corporations. These less visible forms of debt include so-called vendor financing, increasingly popular at technology companies, and syndicated lending by banks to new companies.
Vendor financing usually involved a company -- Lucent Technologies is an example -- using its high-grade balance sheet to finance equipment that it sells to customers with weaker credit profiles. The buyer gets the equipment at much lower interest rates than it would otherwise have been able to get from a bank.
But the seller takes on the risk of lending money to a speculative company. And indeed, last month, Lucent warned investors that it was increasing its expenses to cover bad debts from its customer financing. The news sent Lucent's stock reeling, and it dropped 32 percent in a single day.
Syndicated lending by banks is also largely hidden from investors' views, Mr. Suria pointed out. Last summer, federal regulators reviewed large loans made by banks across the nation. They found that classified credits, loans that are defined as substandard, doubtful or lost, increased by almost 70 percent this year over 1999.
On Wall Street, there's another worrisome factor: As the high-yield market has grown in recent years, the number of brokerage firms and banks willing to trade the securities has declined. Some of the decline stems from mergers in the financial services industry, but even the firms that still stand ready to facilitate their customers' purchases and bond sales have sharply reduced the amount of money they are willing to offer for this business.
Mr. Fridson estimated that since 1998, the capital that firms were willing to commit to make secondary markets in high-yield bonds has been slashed by at least 50 percent.
Another important change is that a much wider array of investors now hold these high-yield bonds. In 1990 and 1991, that market stumbled as the country sank into recession and the Resolution Trust Corporation made matters worse by forcing savings and loan institutions to sell their high-yield bonds at fire-sale prices. Most hurt then were financial institutions that were holding these securities; today, the risks in the market are more widely spread among financial institutions, insurance companies, sophisticated investors like those who put money in hedge funds and individual buyers of high-yielding mutual funds.
This shift of ownership has good and bad aspects. On the plus side, some financial institutions may wind up in better shape after the next peak in defaults because they carry less of the total amount of troubled securities than they did the last time around. If these institutions are not at great risk, then the chances of an economic meltdown are reduced.
But some analysts fear that even if Mr. Greenspan cuts interest rates in coming months, it may not help this situation. The cost of debt capital for high-yield telecom companies is 15.6 percent;if the Fed eases by 200 basis points, it wouldn't substantially lower their costs.
Furthermore, since the huge growth in capital spending that has fueled economic growth in the United States was largely funded by high-yield bonds, when the market freezes, it cuts off access to capital. When a big growth engine stalls, the economy could get hit hard.

HEADLINE: FIVE QUESTIONS for JAMES E. COPELAND JR.;
Can Accounting Firms Live With New Rules?

BYLINE: By JONATHAN D. GLATER

 BODY:
THE Securities and Exchange Commission voted last week to adopt rules for accounting firms that will impose restrictions on the consulting services auditors provide to clients. The rules seek to prevent situations in which auditors have an incentive to skew their reports to make the advice they had provided look more impressive.
The most contentious restriction in the rules, which take effect next year, forbids auditors to operate the advanced technology systems of their clients, although they may consult on information technology projects if the client makes all management decisions. 
 The rules also limit audit firms to 40 percent -- measured as a share of total hours worked -- of a client's internal audit work, to prevent an external auditor from evaluating its own employees' internal audit.
A fierce early critic of the proposed restrictions was James E. Copeland Jr., chief executive of Deloitte & Touche.
Mr. Copeland now says that he generally supports the rules. He discussed his initial concerns and the reasons he is less worried now. Following are excerpts from the conversation. JONATHAN D. GLATER
 
Q. What were your initial fears about the impact of the rules as first outlined by the S.E.C.?

A. Our biggest concern was that the rule would be a de facto requirement that we dismantle our firm and sell off the consultancies and other competencies that really are needed to do a competent audit.
You need a world-class team of people that cross a lot of disciplines, in order to provide adequate audit service, because an auditor to some extent serves as a general practitioner or general contractor. There is no way that you're going to have a person whose background is in education and auditing, for example, also trained in actuarial science.
In consulting, you have talented people with these different backgrounds, and you have to allow them to work on things that are state of the art for them. Auditing is not necessarily state of the art for an actuary or a technologist, so you have to be able to give them a chance to work on the problems that are cutting edge in their professions. Otherwise it is impossible to retain them.

Q. How much of your revenue comes from the consulting business?

A. Deloitte Consulting probably represents around 50 percent of our business in the United States.
But that's not all the consulting that we do, and that's the problem: The rule would've affected every consultative aspect of what we do.
Potentially, our tax consulting might have been at risk, or our information security consulting.

Q. What is the significance of the restriction on the amount of a client's internal audit work that an accountant can perform?

A. I don't think the 40 percent limit makes any sense, that number is just a way of compromising. It doesn't make any difference whether you're getting audit support from your own people or from an accounting firm.
The rule will create some artificial limitations on how much we can do in a given situation. A client will have to decide, O.K., we've used firm X for 500 hours this year on internal audit outsourcing, now we can't use them anymore.

Q. Will the rules hamper accounting firms like yours that want to provide consulting services relative to pure consulting companies?

A. In fact, I see them at a competitive disadvantage. If you want to install a new e-business system, there are some massive tax implications in that. You can deal with those issues independently or you can deal with them in an integrated way, and we believe that a client would prefer to deal with them in an integrated way.

Q. What is the likely long-term effect of the rules on the consulting services offered by accounting firms?

A. There will be heightened sensitivity around this issue and I am sure that will have some impact on clients' purchasing decisions this year. But over time, the market will buy consulting services from the best provider of that particular service. I think that's just economics.

HEADLINE: GRASS ROOTS BUSINESS;
City Survives a Flood, But Faces an Exodus

BYLINE: By JOEL KOTKIN; Joel Kotkin is a senior fellow at the Davenport Institute for Public Policy at Pepperdine University. His column on the Main Street economy appears the third Sunday of each month. E-mail: grassrts@nytimes.com

DATELINE: GRAND FORKS, N.D.

 BODY:
KEN TOWERS had planned to be retired by now, but nearly four years after a flood devastated his two restaurants and much of this city of 47,000, the 62-year-old restaurateur is still struggling to stay ahead.
Mr. Towers said 51 inches of water from several days of rain in April 1997 destroyed the equipment at his two restaurants, driving him out of business for nearly a month. Flooding at his home also forced him to live with relatives. "It was like the feeling you have after the death of a close friend," Mr. Towers said. 
 Yet despite the damage, Mr. Towers's two restaurants, a Wendy's franchise and his own Italian Moon pizza parlor, are back in business, as are most other businesses in Grand Forks, located in the northeast corner of the state on the Red River.
But Mr. Towers now faces what he calls "a financial cancer" -- roughly $500,000 in loans from the Small Business Administration needed to rebuild his business -- and that makes retiring in the foreseeable future almost impossible.
"People here don't tend to give up," said Mr. Towers, who traces this determined spirit to the strong religious faith shared by many local residents. "We are stronger, more resilient. We have the pioneer attitude -- we are not simply going to give up everything we have and move to Phoenix."
But if Grand Forks has come back to life, it remains, like many places in the vast stretches of the Great Plains, an economically troubled place. In addition to the flood, the city's economy has been weakened by a sustained agricultural recession, the recent closing of a local missile base and a persistent "brain drain" of younger, educated people.
The aftermath of the flood remains the most evident problem. Randy L. Newman, president of the First National Bank North Dakota, which is based here, estimates the flood wiped out as much as $1 billion in net worth of residents and businesses.
But other, more fundamental problems also worry Mr. Newman. The city's continued reliance on agriculture, he fears, provides little of the kind of economic growth entrepreneurs like Mr. Towers will need to meet their debt obligations. Taxable sales in Grand Forks, for example, have remained below the level of Fargo, the state's largest city, for over a decade, and overall economic growth has been torpid despite the strong national expansion.
"Until we change our economy, Grand Forks is going to be steady, slow and stagnant," said Mr. Newman, 46, whose bank building was severely damaged in the flood. "We are already stuck in very low growth."
These problems are clearly evident in the downtown area's 12 square blocks.
After the flood, the old central core looked like a war zone. A fire that started in the wake of the flood destroyed 11 buildings, and some residents and officials thought the whole area, across the river from Minnesota, should be abandoned.
INSTEAD, the city, using federal disaster aid as well as local bank loans, rebuilt much of the downtown, restoring many early 20th-century buildings.
Several small parks, graced with public sculptures, flourish today, as do many restaurants, coffee shops and bars. Yet the economic recovery remains spotty, with building vacancies running at least 25 percent.
To entrepreneurs like Mr. Towers, rebuilding the downtown is both a source of pride and contention. Given the massive debt that limits business expansion here, Mr. Towers wonders if the funds spent on restoring that part of the city may have been better used in helping other businesses throughout the region.
"The city did a great job," said Mr. Towers, whose two restaurants are located on the city's outskirts, "but you can see the vacancies. People elsewhere could have gotten more."
The biggest long-term problem facing Grand Forks, Mr. Towers and many other local residents say, is not misplaced priorities but a rapidly aging population and the steady loss of younger, educated people. Two of Mr. Towers's three children have left the state -- one daughter moved to South Carolina, another to Vermont.
"This is a great place to educate a family and raise kids," Mr. Towers said. "But people have to leave if they want to make a decent living."
Since the flood, the city's population has dropped to 47,000 from 52,000. The impact is especially noticeable at the city's schools. The kindergarten class of 2000, for example, is down by 100 from 1997, a decline of more than 12 percent. Most years, the graduating class from the three high schools in Grand Forks gets smaller as families move to Fargo, Minneapolis and places outside the region.
The loss of younger people, Mr. Newman and other community leaders say, is slowing the city's transition to a more high-technology, information-oriented economy.
On the surface, the city has powerful assets, most notably a public education system that sends roughly 80 percent of its high school students to college, as well as the presence of the University of North Dakota.
But Gerald H. Groenewold, president of the Energy and Environmental Research Center at the University of North Dakota, said 70 percent of the graduates from his university and from North Dakota State University in Fargo leave for other states.
"Unfortunately, our biggest high-value export has been people," said Dr. Groenewold, whose research center has been among the leaders in keeping its staff in the area.
The university's faculty and students, he said, helped create companies like Meridian Environmental Technology Inc., which provides computerized weather projections.
Leon Osborne, the company's founder and a professor of atmospheric science, has hired 25 local people, and he finds a large number of students are eager to stay in Grand Forks. Yet most talented students, he said, do not find adequate opportunities for advancement and eventually move on to other places.
"I've seen so many brilliant students come and then leave," Mr. Osborne said. "It's not only that they leave but they can't come back."
PART of the problem, many local residents say, lies in the North Dakota culture. The very stolid spirit that allowed for rebuilding the city from the flood also works against financing start-ups, whether in technology or other fields, said David Badman, who runs a custom jewelry business in the restored downtown.
"There's a very conservative farm attitude," he said. "You'd rather give away money to some guy with a tractor than to a creative person or computer entrepreneur."
Mark Schill, 23, who runs a small Internet business in downtown Grand Forks, agreed. "People here tend to be into cash flow," he said.
That tendency has been reinforced recently because the flood has left many residents too preoccupied with debt to take risks.
"We could survive the flood and start again," Mr. Schill said, "but we won't survive if we don't change how we do things here."

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH: Katherine Schapiro and Stacey Ho;
Wells Fargo International Equity Fund

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD

 BODY:
DON'T worry about the raised voices behind the closed door at Wells Capital Management in San Francisco. It's just Katherine Schapiro and Stacey Ho, co-managers of the $240 million Wells Fargo International Equity fund, clashing over Japan again.
"We're good friends, but we are very well-known in the company for our discussions, usually loud ones," said Ms. Schapiro, who wants to buy more Japanese stocks for the fund. 
 Ms. Ho, who was raised in Japan, countered, "The mistake that most foreigners like Kate make is not understanding that Japan is a socialist country. You don't get rewarded for making changes." So far, she has convinced Ms. Schapiro to stay on the sidelines until Japan seems like a better bet.
Such outcomes from their heated debates have been good for shareholders. The fund returned 17 percent a year, on average, for the three years through Thursday, compared with 11.4 percent for its foreign stock peers, according to Morningstar Inc.
Ms. Ho, 43, and Ms. Schapiro, 41, scour the world outside the United States, looking for value mostly among the 10,000 or so companies with market capitalizations exceeding $1 billion. They whittle these down by looking for annual per-share earnings growth likely to exceed 10 percent over the next 12 to 24 months, and price-earnings multiples below a Morgan Stanley global index, excluding the United States, that is now about 21 times projected earnings over the next 12 months.
Finally, they boot out companies with what they view as extreme political, currency, economic or liquidity risks, among them those based in Malaysia, Indonesia and Russia.
From the 300 remaining stocks, the managers use five factors to select the 65 to 70 stocks in the fund. Ranking each factor from No. 1, or least favorable, to No. 5, they then calculate a composite score.
The first two factors examine potential earnings growth and various valuation measures, depending on the industry. For banks they review the multiple of price to book value, or net worth. For telecommunications companies, they review the ratio of price to earnings before interest, depreciation, taxes and amortization, or Ebidta. In both cases, the lower the better.
To evaluate management, Ms. Ho said, "We look at whether they are expanding operating margins, and whether they implement what they say they will do, like cost-cutting."
They assess sentiment by looking at whether a stock is being accumulated by investors or sold off, Ms. Schapiro said, and by assessing the market appeal of the company's products or services.
They take a closer look at country risk, like changes in government policies; individual company risk, like major product transitions; and currency risk.
They further reduce risk by diversifying across countries, regions and industries. Its biggest stakes are in Britain, 16 percent; Japan, 14 percent; France, 12 percent; Germany, 8 percent; Switzerland, 6 percent; and the Netherlands, 5 percent.
Most stocks fit into major global, regional and industry trend categories the managers have identified. Right now, they are shifting from pricey growth stocks, especially in technology, into food, drug and other traditional value stocks. They are also buying into the global trend toward outsourcing corporate tasks like payroll administration, product testing and manufacturing.
Ms. Schapiro and Ms. Ho sell stocks when a company's financial performance deteriorates, when they see increased risks or when they lower their opinions of management. The fund's turnover is a modest 35 percent a year.
Corporate outsourcing led the managers to Ase Test, a semiconductor testing firm in Taiwan, whose shares are traded on the Nasdaq. They bought shares in September 1999 for $23, adding more in October when prices fell to $15.43 because of domestic banking problems and concerns about tensions with China. The company tests computer chips from the design stage to the final product.
"Some of the biggest semiconductor manufacturers are based in Taiwan, so they benefit from the proximity," Ms. Ho said, adding that she expects earnings to grow 30 percent a year over the next three years. On Friday, shares closed at $14.88.
THE managers also found value in Total Fina Elf S.A., a global oil and gas company traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The company was formed when Total, in France, bought Petrofina, in Belgium, and Elf Aquitaine, also in France. The company has excellent reserves, Ms. Schapiro said, but it trades at a discount to competitors like Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Petroleum. She said it had excellent cost-cutting opportunities.
The fund bought shares in October 1996 for $39 each, adding more in October of this year for $71.63. Shares closed Friday at $70.38.
In February, the fund bought shares in Elan, traded on the Big Board, for $36 each and more shares in October for $51.93. Elan, a specialty drug company in Dublin, now focuses on products used in cardiology, neurology and pain management. It is developing a vaccine for Alzheimer's and treatments for Parkinson's, Crohn's disease and multiple sclerosis. Even so, Ms. Schapiro said, it trades at a discount to major drug companies and other specialty drug firms. She expects earnings to grow about 20 percent a year over the next three years. Its shares closed Friday at $50.56.

HEADLINE: The Ruin of Myanmar

 BODY:
The Southeast Asian nation of Myanmar is a case study in repression and misgovernment. For 12 years a secretive military junta has ground down the liberties and living standards of 50 million people. By banning most contact with the outside world and buying off the leadership of restive ethnic minorities, the junta has deflected serious challenges to its rule, despite the dismal failure of its economic policies and spreading social ills.
The military has ruled Myanmar since 1962, when it was known as Burma. After the violent suppression of a democracy movement in 1988, an even more ruthless set of generals took charge. They permitted elections in 1990, then ignored the results when democratic forces led by Daw Aung Sang Suu Kyi won an overwhelming victory. She has spent 6 of the past 11 years under house arrest. Other leaders of her party have been relentlessly persecuted, university students have been relocated from the cities, and unions and civic associations have been prohibited. The junta has banned computer modems, e-mail and the Internet and made it a crime for people to invite foreigners into their homes. 
 The Times's Blaine Harden recently reported that Myanmar, which a half-century ago had one of Asia's best health care systems and highest literacy rates, is now near the bottom in these and many other measures of development as government spending has been diverted from schools and health care to the military. Most people now live on less than a dollar a day. Drug smuggling and AIDS have grown explosively and threaten to spill over to neighboring countries like China and Thailand.
The United States has led international efforts to isolate Myanmar through economic sanctions, including a ban on new investment. But other Asian countries have been reluctant to apply pressure. China, in particular, has helped sustain the junta through military aid. But an increasing number of countries are losing patience. Last week the 175-member International Labor Organization took the unusual step of condemning the junta's use of forced labor and invited member countries to impose sanctions. A good start would be restricting trade and investment in areas of the economy that profit from forced labor. Washington too should consider additional steps like encouraging disinvestment by American companies. Myanmar's people deserve international support in their struggle against a destructive tyranny.

A Manager Practices What She Preaches

 BODY:
It stands to reason that the prime money manager for the United Nations pension fund would be a booster of global investing. In its $850 million acquisition of Fiduciary Trust International, which runs six mutual funds and manages money for institutions, late last month, Franklin Resources acquired such a booster in Anne M. Tatlock, who will continue as the Fiduciary Trust chief executive.
In global equity accounts, Fiduciary Trust has kept 55 percent abroad, 45 percent in North America, all year. Ms. Tatlock maintains the currency losses on foreign investments have about run their course. "The dollar is not likely to be appreciating 30 percent ad infinitum," she said. "The United States is not the only country that has improved inflation." 
 Besides continuing to run its own funds, Fiduciary Trust will advise the Franklin Templeton mutual funds, owned by Franklin Resources. Fiduciary Trust manages about $16 billion of the United Nations pension fund, one financial industry executive said.

HEADLINE: A New Social Security

 BODY:

To the Editor:
The measures proposed for Social Security ("A Retirement Plan That Wall Street Likes," Economic View, Nov. 12) are bailing water out of a sinking ship. Social Security is a pyramid scam, since retirees get more out than they pay in. The column advocates transferring more income in the form of higher payroll taxes, and cutting benefits, and alleges that this marginal adjustment would cost less than funding the privatization shortfall out of the budget surplus. 
 This adjustment would only keep Social Security afloat for a projected 75 years. Before then, payroll taxes will have to be raised again and again. The only moral and practical solution is to phase out Social Security, and allow individuals to plan for their own retirement.

 BODY:
Following is the text of President Clinton's Thanksgiving Day proclamation.
 
Thanksgiving 2000
 
By the President of the United States of America
We have much to be grateful for this Thanksgiving Day. Our Nation is free, prosperous and at peace. The remarkable growth in human knowledge and technological innovation offers real hope for defeating the age-old enemies of humanity: poverty, famine and disease. Our dynamic economy continues to generate millions of new jobs, and, as wages rise and unemployment falls to its lowest level in more than a generation, millions of American families are sharing in the bounty of this great land for the first time. 
 Sharing in God's blessings is at the heart of Thanksgiving and at the core of the American spirit. At Plymouth in 1621, the Pilgrims celebrated their first harvest in the New World thanks to the generosity of their Native American neighbors. In return, the Pilgrims invited these tribal members to share in their harvest festival. At Thanksgiving this year and every year, in worship services and family celebrations across our country, Americans carry on that tradition of giving, sharing not only with family and friends, but also with those in need throughout their communities.
Every generation of Americans has benefited from the generosity, talents, efforts and contributions of their fellow citizens. All of us have been enriched by the diverse cultures, traditions and beliefs of the millions of people who, by birth or choice, have come to call America their home. All of us are beneficiaries of our founders' wisdom and of the service and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform. While Americans are an independent people, we are interdependent as well, and our greatest achievements are those we have accomplished together.
As we celebrate Thanksgiving, let us remember with gratitude that despite our differences in background, age, politics or race, each of us is a member of our larger American family and that, working together, there is nothing we cannot accomplish in this promising new century.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Thursday, November 23, 2000, as a National Day of Thanksgiving. I encourage all the people of the United States to assemble in their homes, places of worship and community centers to share the spirit of fellowship and prayer and to reinforce the ties of family and community; to express heartfelt thanks to God for our many blessings; and to reach out in gratitude and friendship to our brothers and sisters across this land who, together, comprise our great American family.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of November, in the year of our Lord two thousand, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-fifth. WILLIAM J. CLINTON

One Way to Break a Tie: Start the Next Race

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
WILL Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raising king, get his wish and become ambassador to the Court of St. James's? Or will Andy Card, the deputy White House chief of staff in Bush I, be promoted to chief of staff in Bush II?
Will Martin Peretz, the publisher of The New Republic and a Gore mentor who last week mocked Gov. George W. Bush as "ordinary" for naming his dog Spot, become the Bebe Rebozo/Vernon Jordan figure of the Gore administration? Or will Robert Bartley, who runs The Wall Street Journal's editorial page, which skewered the vice president for mounting "A Gore Coup d'Etat," serve that role for Mr. Bush? 
 Will Jon Bon Jovi and Ben Affleck and other entertainers who stumped for Mr. Gore in the campaign's waning days get to sleep in the Lincoln bedroom? Or will Heather Locklear and Bo Derek, who pitched in for Mr. Bush, be hanging out in the residence?
Twelve days after the unelection, no one knows how to keep a rendezvous with destiny -- not the politicians, not the lobbyists, not the chatterers in the press, not the hangers-on, not the sycophants, not even the White House interns.
"They've all got whiplash now because they don't know who to play up to," said Mike Murphy, a Republican strategist. "It's a real upside-down world right now."
The effect of all this confusion and anxious calculation is that some strategists are already moving on to the midterm election of 2002 -- and the presidential campaign two years after that -- to plot how to position themselves and their party for best advantage. With the presidential election essentially a tie -- and the House and Senate enduring the closest margins in nearly half a century -- a brutal war, to break the tie in two years or four, is beginning.
The problem, however, is that no one knows how the war should be fought. H. L. Mencken once wrote that "democracy is the theory that common people know what they want." But the split verdicts have left politicians wondering what the people truly want.
Do voters want fierce partisans, championing their core issues? Or do they want the combatants to join forces and get something done?
Senator Charles Schumer, Democrat of New York, believes cooperation is the key. "The only message that comes across," he said, "is one that looks from high up above and says, 'They better work together' and 'We're afraid of one party having too much power.' That's what the American people are saying. It's certainly possible that people will misread that message. But they do so at their peril."
Not so, said Representative Joe Scarborough, a Florida Republican who was elected during the Gingrich revolution of 1994. Tensions over the scrambled outcome are so roiling his constituents, he said, that they are spoiling any hope of bipartisanship. "People are calling our office crying, saying, 'They're stealing the election from us. What can we do?' " Mr. Scarborough said.
Meanwhile, in Florida, The Associated Press reported, Mr. Bush led Mr. Gore by 926 votes with all the absentee ballots counted. Legal challenges and hand recounts continue.
Flying blind, politicians may have to start taking chances. For example, if Mr. Bush wins, should the House Democratic leader, Richard Gephardt, invite him to lunch in a play for bipartisanship? Or should he keep his distance, hoping that if nothing gets done, Democrats will be primed to reclaim the House in 2002? If Mr. Gore wins, the House speaker, Dennis Hastert, must make similar calculations, or rather, guesses.
Senator John Breaux, a Louisiana Democrat, said a great deal hinges on who does not become president and the note of his concession speech. "The losing speaker is the most important speech of the campaign, because that person is going to set the tone for the next four years," Mr. Breaux said. "If he urges cooperation, it will be extremely helpful. If he says, 'The election has been stolen from me, and I'm going to run again the next time,' nothing will get done."
BUT even given the most gracious loser imaginable, politicians in both parties say they foresee fierce battles between Congress and the new president. "You look at the electoral landscape and we're about as divided as they come," Mr. Scarborough said. "You wonder if a candidate exists that can begin to even unite these various demographic factions."
The one certainty in all of this is that politics remains a struggle for power, and if anything, the unstable balance between the two parties will increase the intensity of that contest.
Right now there are two theories about which party will gain from this election. The traditionalist theory says the winning party will gain; the other, stealth, theory, is that this time around, the loser is the winner.
The party that loses the presidential election, said Senator Robert Torricelli, a New Jersey Democrat, will win the elections in 2002.
In fact, even as the candidates cling desperately to every possibility of capturing the White House, there are plot-and-scheme crowds in both parties quietly savoring the possibilities of losing.
One prominent Republican refused to speak publicly about his hope that Mr. Bush would lose, saying, "It's treason."
A well-known Democrat said of Mr. Gore: "I've got a lot of psychic energy invested in him. But there's an argument that if you take the win now, you're almost setting yourself up for a loss in the next two cycles."
For people like these, winning the White House would be a poisoned chalice. They contend that the losing party will be so bitter, and Capitol Hill so deadlocked, that the loser will be in a perfect position to sweep right in four years hence and rescue the presidency from a man who never deserved it in the first place.
This year, "the winner may be the guy who's holding the bag on recession, the bag on gridlock, the bag on a split Congress," said Roger Stone, a Republican strategist. "In four years, people are going to ask whoever is president: Did you solve the Social Security problem? Did you solve the Medicare problem? Did you solve the prescription drug problem? The better part of valor here may be to step aside."
Naturally, others argue just as forcefully that such ideas are nonsense, that the presidency is the indispensable prize. "Why give up?" said Representative Robert Wexler, a Democrat from Palm Beach, Fla. "Once you lose and the other guy is inaugurated, it's over. And four years is a long time in politics."
After all, Americans these days seem to move from crisis to crisis without looking back. Exhibit No. 1 is impeachment; President Clinton emerged intact, and his accusers are the ones who suffered.
"At the end of the day, people will want their president to govern," said Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, a Republican. "I don't think they want whoever lost the race to pollute the air with the notion that somehow it's illegitimate."
This year, nobody has any idea how politicians or the public will regard the loser. If Mr. Bush wins, will Mr. Gore be reviled by his own party for losing the White House after eight years of economic boom? Or will he be treated as the king-in-exile, robbed of the White House and deserving to return? David Axelrod, a Democratic strategist in Chicago, believes a losing Mr. Gore would be "the presumptive front runner" in 2004.
MR. BUSH, if he loses, faces similar questions, though he is a more popular figure in his party than Mr. Gore in his.
"If the party perceives that he was done in by post-facto rule-making in Florida," said Steve Forbes, who ran twice for the Republican nomination, "he would have the moral standing to establish himself as the equivalent of a shadow government."
Of course, some people think Mr. Axelrod and Mr. Forbes have it dead wrong. Among the few in Washington who seem sure of themselves these days are two shrewd lobbyists: Haley Barbour, a former Republican national chairman who advises the Bush campaign, and Tommy Boggs, a Democrat. They are partners in the Caucus Room, a new bipartisan restaurant with a pricey wine list. They expect to survive, even thrive, whatever the electoral outcome.

HEADLINE: Global Warming Moves From Impassioned Words to Modest Deeds

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
Forget the diplomats dithering over protocols and the scientists agonizing over equations. The next wave of the global warming debate is about nuts and bolts. In the New York metropolitan area and in other cities and states, ordinary people in corporations and government -- engineers, teachers and bureaucrats -- are quietly beginning to plan for a future in which climate and geography may be decidedly different.
Many steps are tiny and incremental and uncertain. Many are also self-contained, in some cases the result of a single individual in a city or state agency who has taken up the issue. But environmentalists and politicians say that early steps, in a field where the time horizon stretches into decades, are often the most crucial because they set the patterns and precedents that future generations in the region are likely to have to build upon if the full potential of global warming becomes real. 
 "There's still scientific uncertainty, without a doubt, about what climate change will bring," said William D. Solecki, a professor in the earth and environmental studies department at Montclair State University in New Jersey and a director of a recent federal study on the effects of planetary warming on the New York metropolitan region. "But there's a growing recognition that the future will be different from today."
On Long Island, the Army Corps of Engineers is looking at how to help communities protect themselves from rising sea levels that could bring storm surges miles inland. On Wall Street, El Nino seminars and weather-risk financing have become hallmarks of the newly climate-conscious. In some New York City public schools, complex fluid-dynamic equations of global warming are used to teach math and environmental consciousness.
In New Jersey, which environmentalists say is one of the most active states in coordinating climate-change policies, the state government has begun an aggressive program of buying out property owners whose homes or businesses are in vulnerable flood plains. State economic development officials have been enlisted to promote the idea that global warming defenses can even encourage economic growth, through an energy-efficiency program that helps businesses reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and save money on utility bills.
"It's a balance -- you have to look out in 50- and 100-year increments, but you also have to grapple up front, what your preventative measures can result in now," said New Jersey's commissioner of environmental protection, Robert C. Shinn Jr.
Some experts say the new activity is a product of the region's reservoir of intellectual and financial capital, some of which is finding an outlet in climate-change work and tapping specialties as diverse as energy, oceanography and risk management.
The United Nations, for instance, has become a leading research center on global climate issues. Columbia University's Earth Institute has taken the lead in examining local climate consequences, and the financial district is expected to become a global player in the climate-change economics that are involved in such systems as international trade in greenhouse gas emissions credits. How such a trading system should work is a main agenda item at the international global warming conference now under way in The Hague.
"The metro area is a powerhouse of global warming stuff," said Michael Glantz, a senior scientist at the environmental and societal impact group within the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. "There's a lot of innovation, awareness, intellect and knowledge." What's missing, he said, are coordination and communication. "People are still working in their own worlds and not crossing lines," he said.
There is also a sharp disagreement about what the region's approach should be, particularly whether governments should focus on adapting to an inevitable future, or on efforts to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and thus to try to change that future, if only in a marginal way.
Some groups, like Environmental Defense, a private conservation group, argue that local and state governments in the region should be actively preparing people for a significantly altered terrain in which some coastal areas may have to be surrendered to the rising seas. Scientists at Columbia have projected a worst-case scenario in which the sea rises nearly four feet in the metropolitan area over the next 100 years, an increase that researchers said would pose particular risk to river estuaries.
Most politicians, on the other hand, especially in New Jersey, have adopted what they call a no-surrender policy, vowing to protect at all costs waterfront communities and the millions of dollars in tourism and tax dollars they represent.
Some environmentalists have criticized New York City for declining to join an international federation of cities coordinating efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Members include Los Angeles and Chicago and, more locally, Bridgeport, Conn., and Newark and Maplewood, N.J.
New York's defenders, including Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, say the city already has the lowest per capita emissions rate of greenhouse gases of any large city in the nation because its reliance on mass transit reduces automobile use, a main source of greenhouse gases.
The city, the mayor has said, is working on the problem in its own way. The Department of Design and Construction, for example, which oversees development and renovation of city government buildings, issued guidelines last year focusing especially on energy-saving technology, from fiber optic lighting to geothermal heating and cooling. The guidelines are being incorporated in 15 pilot projects, from the Queens Botanical Garden to Bronx Criminal Court.
The broader plan, though, is to lead by example and hope that the designs catch on in the booming private construction trades, said Hillary Brown, an assistant commissioner at the department's office of sustainable energy. After electricity and natural gas and heating oil prices began climbing this year, she said, private contractors' and owners' interest in the new techniques has climbed, judging from the jump in requests for copies of the guidelines.
In New Jersey, private corporations with large international operations are working with the state to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Johnson & Johnson, the pharmaceutical giant in New Brunswick, signed up with the state's greenhouse gas plan this summer and is putting it into action at its corporate units within the state. The next step: taking the plan to its worldwide corporate operations. "In New Jersey, we will lead and the rest will follow," said Johnson & Johnson's corporate energy director, Harry Kauffman.
In many ways there is no single future to prepare for but rather a wide array of possible futures, because global warming does not necessarily mean simply a hotter climate. Altering the planet's system of heat and precipitation -- the result, many scientists say, of burning fossil fuels that release gases like carbon dioxide into the atmosphere -- is also expected to increase weather variability and heighten storm damage.
Climate also varies and evolves naturally over time, aside from human influence. Average global temperatures were warmer at the last millennium, the year 1000, than they are today. But the "Medieval warm period" was then followed by nearly 500 years of sharply colder temperatures, "the little ice age." Temperatures began rising again in the mid-1800's, at the same time that the Industrial Revolution, with its reliance on the burning of fossil fuels, was developing.
A group studying the effect of altered weather conditions on New York City's water supply is considering one scenario in which the region is hotter and wetter in 2050 than today, and another scenario in which it is hotter and drier. Some researchers are looking at how rising salt water could contaminate underground aquifers on Long Island, and others are looking at whether alternative distribution systems like new aqueducts or water tunnels might be necessary once the rainfall pattern changes.
Other effects of a new climate are completely unknowable. Doctors at the New York State Department of Health say that a warmer weather pattern in the 21st century could make the region more hospitable to foreign diseases like the West Nile virus, which was first detected locally last year. But human factors like an increasingly older population with weaker immune systems and the growth of international travel to exotic locales make the ebb and flow of the biosphere so complex that there is no way to prepare for a specific climate-induced health threat.
"You have to anticipate the potential that there could be an introduction of some new diseases related to this," said Dr. Dale L. Morse, the director of the division of infectious disease at the New York State Department of Health. "But climate is only one of several factors we are looking at, and it's hard to say what weight one factor may have over others."
Some planners are also afraid to share ideas, apparently out of concern about alarming the public. Scientists and environmental groups say that the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has begun a comprehensive internal examination of how climate change could affect the region's transportation network, especially how runways at low-lying airports like La Guardia and Kennedy International could be protected from rising waters.
Port Authority officials declined repeated requests to discuss their analysis or research. A spokesman, Steve Coleman, said researchers were concerned that preliminary ideas would be misconstrued as definitive plans.
In other cases, climate goals are bumping against old-fashioned reality. In Brooklyn, a pilot science curriculum using sustainable energy as the thread to teach concepts about fossil fuels, gas emissions and climate has been tested in a few high schools over the last several years. But experts in environmental education say the program's future is in question because the State Regents exam, which all students must pass to graduate, still relies on traditional science.
And some researchers are looking backward for possible lessons about climatic future. Energy conservation is considered one of the prime ways in which institutions and individuals can reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But Dr. Morse said that energy-saving efforts in the 1970's could have been partly to blame for the spread of Legionella pneumophila, or Legionnaires' disease. To conserve energy, Dr. Morse said, many hospitals reduced the temperature of their hot water by a few degrees, and that slight difference was apparently enough to allow the disease to propagate.

HEADLINE: Italian Sociologist's Goal: Make Opium Farming Fade Into History

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE

DATELINE: TASHKENT, Uzbekistan

 BODY:
Like the other former Soviet republics on the drug route dubbed the New Silk Road, Tajikistan lacks the resources to combat the flow of narcotics from neighboring Afghanistan en route to Russia and Western Europe.
Afghanistan is now the world's largest producer of opium, the base of a multibillion-dollar international heroin trade that feeds European addiction. 
 If Pino Arlacchi has anything to do with it, however, opium should become as much part of history in Afghanistan as it now is in Thailand, which is getting ready to open a museum of opium.
Mr. Arlacchi, a 49-year-old Italian sociologist and expert on organized crime, became the United Nations' top antinarcotics official three years ago. Years of studying and writing about the Italian Mafia, he said, convinced him that the war on narcotics does not have to be fought with armies and tens of millions of dollars.
As he spoke, Mr. Arlacchi (pronounced are-LOCK-key), was flying over the snow-covered peaks that separate Uzbekistan from Tajikistan, on his way to open a new, experimental drug-control agency established with United Nations help in the Tajik capital, Dushanbe.
Over the last year, the fledging Tajik agency and a force of 11,000 Russian border guards have reported seizing about 1.3 tons of heroin from Afghanistan and Pakistan. This is equivalent to amounts intercepted in Europe or the United States, Mr. Arlacchi said.
Opium poppy cultivation on a significant scale is now found in only three countries: Afghanistan, Myanmar and Laos. With the help of a $60 million international fund, Laos promises to be free of opium in five years, Mr. Arlacchi said. Myanmar, formerly Burma, is down to 60 percent of recent production because of pressure from neighboring Southeast Asian nations. Vietnam and China have also slashed opium growing.
Law enforcement is not the only, or even the most important, part of trying to convince poor farmers to stop producing narcotics, Mr. Arlacchi said. "First of all, we have to convince people that organized crime is not invincible," he said, recalling similar experiences in Sicily. "We are not fighting enemies that are bigger than us."
Now he is saying to skeptical governments that most narcotics production can be eliminated more cheaply than most people think. "The farmers do not get rich with opium production. In Afghanistan, at $30 a kilo of opium, you are poor even if you produce 10 kilos. The farmers get a minimal amount, so it's easy to provide them an alternative. Even with the traffickers, who are supposed to make most of the profit at origin, we're speaking about quite modest profits at the source."
"So when I told people that for $25 million a year for 10 years we can eliminate opium poppy production in Afghanistan, nobody believed that," he said. "Even now, when I tell people that $3.5 million invested in technical assistance to the agency in Tajikistan and the Russian border troops there, we can block the northern heroin route, people don't believe because they are used to inflated figures."
By Tajik standards, for instance, the 300 members of Tajikistan's new antidrug squad -- chosen, trained and equipped by European experts -- are very well paid at $100 a month in hard currency.
The money, contributed by several European nations, goes directly to the squad members, not to the government, to minimize opportunities for corruption.
Mr. Arlacchi argues that in an age of mass communication "every peasant in the most remote areas of Myanmar or Afghanistan knows perfectly that what he is doing is harmful for other people," and is receptive to alternatives. But, he said, alternative crops sometimes take too long to show a return, meaning that aid is needed -- to people and governments.
In Afghanistan, however, few foreign governments want to deal with the Taliban, preferring a "ring of security" around Afghanistan to contain the problem. Mr. Arlacchi said he is consistently refused money to work inside Afghanistan.
It is also not clear how sincere the Taliban is in its pledges to halt opium production. Their militias, who now control an estimated 95 percent of Afghanistan, face hunger on a national scale and political disaster if they end opium production without offering people alternative incomes.
When the Taliban order poppy production cuts, Mr. Arlacchi said he sees the edicts as "more a way to test the cost of a measure like this than a real, serious attempt to implement it."
In Tajikistan, the United Nations drug-control program cultivated ties with the pro-Russian president, Emomali Rahmonov -- a task that Mr. Arlacchi said was easier than getting the backing of the United States for a program that has so far spent $2.6 million.
Mr. Arlacchi, a tenured professor of sociology at the University of Florence who left a safe seat in the Italian Senate to join the United Nations in 1997, is one of several outsiders hired by Secretary General Kofi Annan for their real-world expertise.
The Italian newcomer ruffled feathers at the United Nations' drug program headquarters in Vienna, removing several top bureaucrats and dispatching others into the field, away from their desks.
A few weeks ago, Mr. Arlacchi visited Bolivia, which is within months of declaring itself free of coca cultivation, and found the backlash against a coca ban there reminiscent of his Sicilian experience. "There was a moment," he said, "when the economy in Sicily got bad and there were demonstrations of thousands of workers against us -- construction workers with billboards saying: 'We want the Mafia back because the Mafia gave us jobs.' "
"In Bolivia, there are very harsh times, and you get demonstrations of coca producers, cocaleros, who have exactly the same platform: 'We want to go back to cultivating coca because it gives us an income,' " he said. "I told the Bolivian government that they have to be firm not giving in, but at the same time they have to listen to them and go ahead and give more resources."
In Thailand, Mr. Arlacchi recalled, the king told him about a village where there was resistance to changing a water course to irrigate fields. The farmers finally admitted that redirecting the water channel was impossible because there was a ghost in the way. They asked the king, who is considered superhuman by many Thais, to deal with the ghost. He said he would, and the water soon flowed to the needy new crops -- at no cost at all to the United Nations program.

When it comes to head coaching salaries, the Jets' Al Groh is earning the National Football League equivalent of minimum wage. His $800,000 salary ranks near the bottom in his profession.
But the Jets (6-4) are getting a big bang for their buck. If you were to take this on a prorated basis for each victory (which, of course, you can't), Groh is earning about $133,000 a victory. Compared with some more stratospheric coaching salaries, his is bargain basement. 
 Especially when Groh's deal is compared with Mike Holmgren's. The Seattle coach-general manager is the highest-paid coach in N.F.L. history at $4 million this season. The Seahawks are 4-7, so Holmgren is earning a nice $1 million a victory.
Like everything else in sports, like player salaries, ticket sales and television contracts, the salaries of N.F.L. head coaches have skyrocketed. With an increase in coaching stress, pressure and responsibilities come fatter paychecks.
"They're higher principally because so many coaches have total control," said Art Modell, the Baltimore owner. "That started the inflationary spiral of the salaries."
In other words, blame Jimmy Johnson.
When Johnson left the Dallas Cowboys in 1993, after guiding them to Super Bowl victories, he stayed out of coaching for two years, eventually joining the Miami Dolphins. But before taking the Dolphins job he wanted total control, meaning Johnson wanted final say on things like the draft and free agency. He also asked for, and received, a multimillion-dollar yearly salary.
Johnson was not the first football guru, but he was the first to have all of the power while also commanding a large payday. Soon after Johnson, a legion of coaches, like Bill Parcells and Tom Coughlin, began insisting on total control as part of their coaching packages. In the process, they were paid more money.
Another reason for the large salaries? As the paychecks of players increase, some owners and general managers made a wise calculation -- they needed the salaries of their coaches to at least be in the same universe as that of their players. You cannot have a coach earning the equivalent of pennies while a player raked in the gross national product of some nations.
When Washington Coach Joe Gibbs retired from football after the 1992 season, he was the highest-paid coach at the time, earning $2 million a year. Now, his salary would barely crack the top 10. In the mid-1990's, Rich Kotite, then the coach of the Jets, was making $400,000 a year; Bill Parcells, then the coach of New England, made $1.2 million a year; and Dan Reeves, then the Giants' coach, made $1 million a year.
Coaching salaries are among the most closely guarded secrets in the sport, but a collection of owners, general managers, coaches and agents gave some insight into just how high the salaries have risen.
Several owners estimated that, in the past decade, coaching salaries have increased about 100 percent. Almost all of the top 10 highest-paid coaches make more than $2 million. Several, like Denver Coach Mike Shanahan and Tennessee's Jeff Fisher, make around $3 million, and Holmgren earns $4 million.
Many in football think coaches deserve the big paychecks. To be certain, they consistently work 15- to 20-hour days, they spend little time with their families during the season and some have health problems because of stress.
But no one should feel sorry for them, either. This is what they chose to do. They love it and, more than ever, they are highly paid for it.
"The salaries are just going to keep rising," Modell said. "There's no end in sight."
 
Dolphins' Taylor Soaring
When the Jets play at Miami today, they will once again see one of the top, but underrated, defensive players in the league: Jason Taylor.
Taylor is having the best season of his career and one of the best of any defensive end in the league. Last week, with his 12-yard sack of San Diego quarterback Moses Moreno, Taylor raised his sack total to a career-high 10 for the season. He also tied the franchise record for consecutive games with a sack, with six.
Taylor is one of the quickest ends in the N.F.L. and is also one of the best athletes of any end in football. He has good sack numbers, and he is equally adept at stopping the run -- his 49 tackles are among the leaders at defensive end.
A Jets coach said Taylor was a major concern for the Jets' offense.
Taylor often deceives offensive linemen because he looks smallish. Taylor stands 6 feet 6 inches tall and has a lanky build, but he weighs a solid 260 pounds. He is quick enough to get around the average tackle but has enough bulk to jam a team's running game.
Taylor is a big reason the Dolphins have one of the best defenses in the N.F.L. and why Miami seems a lock to make the playoffs.
 
George Muddles Through
It has been a rough few weeks for Tennessee's Pro Bowl running back, Eddie George, one of the toughest players in football. He has sprained his knee and sustained a stinging sprained big toe on his right foot. The latter injury irritated him so much that he received a cortisone shot in the toe last week just so he could get through practice.
George is wearing down. Part of the reason is that he has recently faced some of the best defenses. The Titans' last four games have been at Baltimore, at Washington, then home against Pittsburgh and Baltimore.
George is always the focal point of any defense, so defensive coordinators emphasize to their players to punish him physically. And since George is fearless, he rarely runs out of bounds to avoid a tackle; in fact, he likes collisions.
Tennessee can perhaps afford to rest George in spots and allow his body to heal because the team's remaining six games are not that difficult. There are two against Cleveland and contests against the struggling Dallas Cowboys, Cincinnati Bengals and Jacksonville Jaguars. The only difficult contest is at Philadelphia on Dec. 3.
The Titans could risk not playing George against Cleveland and Cincinnati and still easily beat those teams.
 
Chargers' Losses Mounting
San Diego is without a victory in 10 games and has a realistic chance of not earning a victory this season. The Chargers have lost games in every way possible: blowing leads, fumbling the football in the final minutes and missing field goals that could have gained them a victory.
Last week against Miami, the Chargers discovered yet another creative way to lose a football game. In that contest, three San Diego quarterbacks threw interceptions: Moses Moreno had two and Ryan Leaf and Jim Harbaugh each tossed one.
The last time that happened in an N.F.L. game was in November 1995, when three Green Bay quarterbacks -- Brett Favre, Ty Detmer and T. J. Rubley -- all threw picks against Minnesota.

HEADLINE: Long Wait for DNA Result Can Be Justice Delayed

BYLINE: By C. J. CHIVERS

 BODY:
Sometimes, when he awakes in his bedroom, Miguel Camacho is overcome by tightness in his chest. It is painful, he says, to feel his heart beating so fast. Other times, he imagines he is back in his bunk on Rikers Island, awaiting trial for a rape he did not commit.
"I wake up, thinking, 'I'm still in here?' " Mr. Camacho said. "I'm thinking, 'Who's going to help me? Who's going to get me out?' " 
 Mr. Camacho, who was wrongly labeled a violent sex offender this fall, became caught in a frightening trap in modern law enforcement. Jailed on the strength of a witness's word, he faced a long wait before DNA tests proved his innocence.
In the last decade, as the use of DNA has become commonplace, police departments and prosecutors have called this new forensic technology the most important identification tool since the advent of fingerprinting. But for all of DNA's promise, there exists a persistent gap between its potential and its use.
Because of staff shortages and backlogs of evidence at forensic laboratories, the turnaround time for results is often slow. Although forensic labs in New York are in the midst of expansion, it can still take months for DNA tests to be completed, meaning that cases that could be solved quickly are delayed, and, in some cases, the wrongly accused wait in pretrial confinement before DNA proves their innocence.
Such was the case for Mr. Camacho, a resident of the South Bronx who has never been convicted of a crime.
On Sept. 27, he was placed in a police lineup in front of a Parks Department employee who earlier that day had been raped and robbed at gunpoint in Bronx Park, near the New York Botanical Garden. The woman told detectives that he was the rapist.
Although Mr. Camacho, 24, had never met the victim and had three alibi witnesses who said he was home asleep at the time of the crime, it did not matter. He was arraigned the next morning on first-degree rape, first-degree robbery, weapons possession and 12 other charges. He was sent to Rikers Island without bail, and, as an accused sex offender, placed alone in a cell under protective custody.
For nearly a month he prayed, he cried and he told anyone who would listen that he was innocent -- actions that are hardly unusual in any prison, anywhere. Mr. Camacho said one fellow inmate, a Black Muslim who roamed the corridor like a self-appointed cleric, heard his alibi, and said, simply and inaccurately: "Nine out of 10 people who come here never leave." Even the nun who counseled Mr. Camacho saw him as yet another defendant who said he did not do it.
Although the city, prodded by his defense lawyer, rushed his case through its forensic lab, it still took a month before the comparison of DNA taken from the victim to DNA taken from Mr. Camacho's blood proved what he had said all along: the authorities had charged the wrong man. Mr. Camacho was released in late October. The police now say they have identified another suspect, a sex-crime recidivist whose DNA profile is in a law enforcement database and whom they hope to arrest soon.
DNA experts say this case, and others like it, including those of 82 wrongly convicted inmates throughout North America who have been released from their cells in recent years after DNA proved their innocence, highlight the need to expand forensic labs, and to accelerate the turnaround time for test results.
"Those of us who have advocated for law enforcement's use of DNA should have made a better connection to DNA's exonerative power long ago," said Christopher H. Asplen, executive director of the federal government's National Commission on the Future of DNA Evidence.
"Almost every time you identify someone from a database," he said, "you exonerate someone who has been caught up in a web of suspicion through traditional investigative techniques."
Mr. Camacho, a soft-spoken man who said he was so afraid of his fellow inmates that he did not venture into the prison yard during his entire stay, is not the only innocent man to suffer a false accusation.
In June, Capt. Garrick Benson, an active-duty Army officer, was pulled over by the police in St. Louis and charged with rape, sodomy and burglary in an attack on a 25-year-old woman. Two weeks later, DNA proved that he did not commit the crime. The police have since arrested another man, who was linked to the crime by DNA.
In New York, cases move much more slowly than that, although the forensic laboratories run by both the state and city are expanding, and officials hope to cut test time over the next five years.
At the city medical examiner's office, which conducts DNA analysis on all biological evidence collected in rape examinations, cases typically take two or three months. But the department, which had 37 employees solely dedicated to DNA analysis in January, now has 65 assigned to the task, and plans to have 582 employees and new laboratory space and equipment by 2004. "Once we are fully staffed, there will be no reason we can't turn around cases in one week," said Ellen S. Borakove, the laboratory's spokeswoman.
The State Police Forensic Investigation Center in Albany is undergoing a similar expansion.
It had 30 employees in January, and his since hired 65 more. The new equipment and staff are underwritten by $13.2 million in the state budget earmarked to improve the use of DNA in criminal investigations, a roughly 17-fold increase from the $750,000 the state spent on the technology in 1995. The laboratory's officials hope to cut its turnaround time, which can now take months, to 30 days by next fall.
In many respects, Mr. Camacho, for all his ill fortune, was lucky to be freed in only one month. The authorities say this case received accelerated handling only after the Legal Aid Society lawyer assigned to it, James A. Rogers, sent all three alibi witnesses to testify before the grand jury. The witnesses were convincing enough that the assistant district attorney agreed to push for the DNA tests to receive immediate attention.
Once the results came back, Mr. Rogers said, they showed that unless DNA results are readily and quickly available, cases that rely solely on eyewitness testimony will continue to harm the innocent. He noted that the victim of the rape in Bronx Park had sincerely believed that Mr. Camacho was her attacker, and she was wrong.
"Identification evidence always has to be taken with a grain of salt, regardless of the fact that the witness is positive, regardless of the good intentions of the police and everybody else involved," Mr. Rogers said.
"If we relied on the witness in this case, and if there wasn't the DNA, Miguel Camacho would still be on Rikers Island."
Jane Siegel Greene, the executive director of the Innocence Project at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University, which has helped 42 inmates in North America overturn convictions through DNA testing, said Mr. Camacho's case, like others, fit a type.
"We find in 90 percent of DNA exonerations, faulty eyewitness identification was a major factor in conviction," Ms. Greene said.
"The beauty of DNA is that it shows the systemic failure of our systems," she added. "There needs to be corroborative evidence in eyewitness cases. People are being convicted on eyewitness accounts alone, and it is a scary thing, when you see these consequences."
Mr. Camacho is home now, living with his mother and grandmother in the Bronx. He seems more relieved to be out of his cell than angry that he had been put in it. But he said he continued to suffer consequences from the charges.
There are indignities small and large. They range from the frustration of not having his winter jacket -- the police have yet to return his personal effects -- to his surreal dreams.
He said he also worried about what his neighbors think after seeing his name, photograph and address in news media coverage in which he was described as a terrifying sexual predator -- a man who stripped his victim at gunpoint, and then, after raping her, threw her clothes in a tree, forcing her to run naked through the streets in search of help. He knows of only one television news program that later told viewers he had been wrongly accused.
"I still get people giving me faces, like, 'Yo, we got to watch over him,' " he said.
Moreover, Mr. Camacho, who was unemployed when he was arrested, said he had been unable to find work. Each time he fills out a job application, he said, he is asked if he has ever been arrested. He has to answer yes, he said. Then he has to list the charges: rape, robbery, criminal possession of a weapon, on down the line.
"I try to tell them what happened, but, you know, it's of no use," he said.
"I leave and they're like" -- he made a motion like a basketball free throw -- "there goes my application, into the can."

HEADLINE: COUNTING THE VOTE: THE REPUBLICANS;
Election's Lessons Become Focus for G.O.P. Governors

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.

DATELINE: WESLEY CHAPEL, Fla., Nov. 18

 BODY:
The Republican Governors Association ended its annual meeting here today with its new chairman, Gov. James S. Gilmore 3rd of Virginia, declaring that "against this background" the meeting had been the best ever for the group.
He might just as easily have declared that "against this background" the meeting had been the most frustrating ever for the group. 
 The "background," of course, was the still up-in-the-air outcome of the presidential race in Florida.
The governors were gathered here, at a golf resort just north of Tampa, not because Florida was the scene of the most disputed election in modern memory but because it was Florida's long-scheduled turn to play host to the yearly affair. Their program originally called for them to discuss such things as governing in the New Economy, but the Florida balloting brouhaha so dominated the two-day meeting that they all but junked their scheduled discussions and focused instead on the fairness, and unfairness, of the American electoral system and whether, indeed, it could endure.
They concluded that it probably could -- but only if Democrats were persuaded that their seemingly endless challenges to the system were slowly but surely eroding confidence in it. And even if the erosion were stopped, they said, it would be best before the 2004 election to take a fresh, hard look at how to prevent another Florida-style recount.
"We have to somehow reassure Americans of the integrity of the system," said Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, going on to suggest, as did many of his colleagues, that states needed to develop better voting procedures and machines.
Publicly, just about all of the 26 governors in attendance here said they were confident that in the end the most prominent member of their group, George W. Bush (who did not show), would prevail. But in asides in the hallways of the conference center they used the words "hope" and "frustrated" far more often than the word "confident."
And early this afternoon, during the final news conference of the meeting, the frustration finally boiled to the surface and spilled over, very loudly and very publicly.
Governor Gilmore had just finished saying "I don't believe anybody is discouraged" about where Election 2000 was headed when Gov. William J. Janklow of South Dakota, never less than outspoken, stepped forward, leaned into the microphone and offered a different opinion.
"There's nothing we can do," he began, his voice quaking and rising. "They're going to steal the election. We all know it. But what we can do is start now changing the rules for the next election. You know how we send observers to other country's elections? Well, we're at the point where others are going to have to start sending observers to watch us."
Governor Gilmore tried again, taking back the microphone and offering that perhaps it was not "wise" to anticipate too much about the future.
Earlier, during one of the conference's formal sessions, Gov. Bill Graves of Kansas said the current American election system was "a Crock-Pot process in a microwave age."
Gov. Bob Taft of Ohio also called for revisions in the way the nation votes. "It needs to be made more reliable," he said. "What's happened here in Florida is a wake-up call for modernizing the system."
But while there was much talk at the conference here of modernizing the current election system, there was no concerted call for federal intervention or for taking any steps that might raise constitutional questions, such as doing away with the Electoral College. In almost every case, governors said it should be left to individual states to modernize their systems, and in most cases they spoke only of streamlining and simplifying rules and procedures, along with installing better balloting machines and processes.
"This is more a matter of working with what we've got," Governor Gilmore said. "We certainly don't need any federal involvement and we most certainly should avoid any fundamental changes in the system. Retuning, yes. But no more. In fact, if people had just followed the laws and procedures already on the books, this mess in Florida would have been cleared up days ago."

HEADLINE: Defiant Chinese Muslims Keep Their Own Time

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

DATELINE: KASHGAR, China

 BODY:
In this far western outpost, where a Muslim majority lives restively under Chinese rule, you can tell a lot about a man's politics by how he sets his clock.
For the last half-century, China's Communist leaders have required the entire country to mark the hours by Beijing time, even though this far-flung city of veiled women, spice markets and donkey carts should be two, probably three, time zones behind. In Kashgar, in Xinjiang Province, really living by Beijing time would mean getting up in total darkness nearly 365 days a year. 
 So many local Muslims, defiant and increasingly disaffected, set their watches two hours behind Beijing, a nod both to nature and their separate identity. "The Chinese want us to follow Beijing time, but most of us are unwilling," said a young soda vender named Abduljim, whose timepiece on a recent morning read 7:45, when the official time was 9:45. "We are Uighurs -- Muslims -- we should follow Xinjiang time, our time, here."
Time, like almost everything else here in Kashgar, has become suffused with questions of power, control and ethnic divisions -- between the dominant Chinese and the native Muslims, Uighurs who speak a Turkic language and are culturally related to the peoples of nearby Central Asia. And in recent years, those divisions have intensified greatly, as more Chinese move into the region and local Uighurs have fallen on economic hard times.
A small Uighur separatist movement has carried out an occasional bombing in Xinjiang and Chinese leaders rail against "splittest" activities here. But far more common are the million little acts of personal defiance -- small efforts to proclaim the difference -- like wearing Islamic dress, refusing to speak Chinese or setting your watch to local time.
The divisions are "definitely worse now that 5 or 10 years ago," said a Uighur businessman who lives in a coastal city but frequently returns home to Xinjiang. "People are angry, they are having trouble finding work, and they feel they have been left out as the country has prospered."
It is unclear whether the sum of all the grumbling and discontent is large enough to threaten Beijing's control over the region or presages larger conflict. After all, Xinjiang has been part of China for 250 years. And if the estimated seven million Uighurs who live here chafe under Chinese rule, they are also wary of the kind of Islamic militancy that has been growing in the former Soviet republics just across the border.
"People always ask, will the Uighurs go get training from the Taliban?" said Dru Gladney, a professor at the University of Hawaii who is an expert on Chinese Muslims, noting that a few have probably already gone. "Sure, if there's money there -- these people don't have much of an alternative, and they're pretty disillusioned. But if someone offers them a scholarship to Harvard, they'd take that, too."
This rising disillusionment comes in part because government programs that once assisted minority groups have dwindled, but even more because of a vast influx of ethnic Chinese into the region -- diluting the culture and taking natives' jobs.
In a province with a heavy police presence, where news is controlled and public meetings forbidden, the Uighurs protest in whatever little ways they can. "When I am there I only buy from stores run by Uighurs, even though I know the price will be higher and the quality not as good," said the businessman. "It's the principle."
He added that the crowded mosques and veiled women in Xinjiang did not reflect piety so much as protest -- people trying to display and preserve their cultural heritage. "Most Uighurs are not very religious, its just that this is the only way they are allowed to express themselves."
Although Uighurs often accuse the Chinese of actively trying to erase their culture, and for many years the Beijing government transferred state employees into the region, today many Chinese from poor surrounding areas come on their own, lured by what for them is a relatively good local job market.
"I think relations have deteriorated and become more polarized than they used to be and that has to do with the market economy," Professor Gladney said. "There has been a large in-migration of Han Chinese," he said, adding, "That has meant that the Uighurs are more marginalized."
He and other experts say that government spending cuts throughout China have only increased the Uighurs' sense of isolation; there is now less money for state television to make Uighur language programming, for example, and for documents to be translated into Uighur.
The net effect is that Uighur culture has receded in much of Xinjiang Province. Many local news programs now uses Mandarin rather than Uighur. More signs are in Chinese characters -- with Uighur script in tiny letters underneath. Urumqi, the provincial capital, has almost lost it ethnic Uighur feel, becoming just another medium-sized Chinese city of white tile office buildings.
Education cutbacks have meant that young Uighurs are not learning functional Chinese, as highly paid native Chinese speakers have been replaced by cheaper local teachers. "My sense is that language ability has dropped a lot in the last 10 years," Professor Gladney said. Without the language, the Uighurs are less able to find jobs in an economy increasingly dominated by Chinese companies.
The changes have been unsettling, pushing many Uighurs into poverty and to the fringes of cities where they once formed the heart and soul. The Uighur businessman, a successful middle-aged man who has lived outside of Xinjiang for more than a decade, said he was shocked at the level of alienation and disaffection he found on a recent trip to Urumqi, which he said stemmed mostly from economic hardship and massive unemployment.
Even college graduates have serious trouble finding jobs, experts say, since the larger companies are mostly Chinese-owned and tend to hire Chinese. Idle time has contributed to a very serious drug problem in the provincial capital.
As Uighur influence has faded in much of the province, many have come to see Kashgar -- a bustling market town, whose Sunday bazaar is filled with camels, sheep and elaborately carved daggers -- as the last holdout against the encroachments of Chinese culture, a symbol as much as a place.
People here know the latest on Rebiya Kadeer, a prominent businesswoman now jailed on charges of revealing state secrets -- her crimes included sending newspaper articles to her husband in the United States -- even though her story has not been covered in the Chinese state media. And they are also well versed in the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia last year, which some celebrate for "liberating" the Muslims in Kosovo; they fantasize about a similar "rescue" here.
In Kashgar, the tension between Chinese and Muslims bubbles beneath the surface, two people living side by side who rarely ever mix. There are Chinese businesses, and Uighur businesses; Chinese restaurants and Uighur restaurants. There is the huge People's Square, presided over by one of the country's largest Mao statues; and the equally sprawling Idkah Square, home to hundreds of vendors and one of China's largest mosques.
When, on Oct. 1, the sky in Kashgar reverberated with the boom of fireworks, a group of young Uighurs on a donkey cart could not figure out what the commotion was about. It was National Day, China's most important holiday.
"We have nothing to do with each other," one Uighur said. "The Chinese here act like they see right through us, like we're not people to them."
Then there is the issue of the time. Big stores, or those owned by Chinese, mostly quote opening hours in Beijing time, as if it were their umbilical cord to civilization. Those owned by Muslims, which tend to be small businesses, are two hours behind.
"We Chinese go by Beijing time," said a bartender named Wang, whose father was sent here to work 20 years ago. "But the Uighurs do not."
Of course, nature -- the sunrises and sunsets -- favors the Uighur point of view on this one, and in practice the Chinese here have had to make a thousand little adjustments in order to live formally by Beijing's clock.
Government offices wait until 10 a.m. Beijing time to open and stay open until 7:30 p.m. The state schools don't start until 9:30 a.m. for example, and even with that, some people grumble that in winter it is too dark for kids to go to school.
"Of course, they should start at 7:30 or 8 like everywhere else in China," said a Uighur man who gave only his first name, Imamu. "But they can't do that because of the sun problem. You can't have children riding to school in the dark."

HEADLINE: CLINTON IN VIETNAM: REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK;
The Question of Liberty, And the Lure of America

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: HANOI, Vietnam, Nov. 18

 BODY:
After President Clinton's motorcade swept out of the gates of Vietnam National University here on Friday, an impromptu teach-in began on the steps of the lecture hall, as American reporters quizzed Vietnamese students about their reaction to Mr. Clinton's speech.
More than once, the students deftly turned the tables, questioning the visitors about their country. 
 "Tell me about your system of higher education," said Anh Le, 20, an English student whose unflinching gaze suggested she would not accept a token response. "I have to give a presentation to my class."
The two reporters speaking to her shifted from foot to foot -- offering some thoughts about the number of foreign students on scholarships, and trying to evoke the atmosphere of an American campus.
"How can we go to these places?" she asked. "Mobility is not the same in Vietnam as it is in the United States."
Her comments said much about the lure of the United States for young Vietnamese. But, in the soft evening air, there were hard reminders that Vietnam remains a closed society.
 
Unnecessary Chaperones
Whenever the exchanges grew animated, well-dressed men with wide smiles sauntered over and offered to translate. Since the students spoke English, the offers were gratuitous. But they were enough to shut down one young woman who had seemed eager to discuss Mr. Clinton's remarks about civil liberties.
Not everyone needed an official from the Interior Ministry to act as a chaperone. Nguyen Hoang Lien, 26, an environmental science student, dismissed the president's comments on political freedom as irrelevant.
"Since the 1930's, we have had only one political party in this country," she said matter-of-factly. "All Vietnamese agree with this."
 
Bill Clinton, Rock Star
Pick up any local newspaper here, and one would conclude that Mr. Clinton's visit is groundbreaking, a landmark, and any other word that means really important. But one would have no clue that Mr. Clinton is being treated like a rock star by people in the streets.
Most papers have covered only the formal meetings between the president and senior Vietnamese officials. While a few reported on Mr. Clinton's speech at Vietnam National University, they quoted sparingly from it, and carried no reaction from students or anyone else who heard it.
Two tabloids did offer a glimpse of Mr. Clinton's charm offensive. They ran a picture of him standing on a balcony, stretching to clasp the hands of delighted children in the house next door.
Reporters at The Vietnam News, the English-language daily, said there was no suspense about how their editors would play the trip. Visiting heads of state are memorialized on the top left-hand side of the front page; the article is always accompanied by a picture of the V.I.P. with Vietnam's president.
On Friday, true to form, the newspaper featured an article in that space under the headline, "U.S. President's Visit Hailed as New Landmark in Bilateral Ties." The photograph showed Mr. Clinton and the Vietnamese president, Tran Duc Luong, reviewing an honor guard at the presidential palace.
The last head of state to get such play was from Luxembourg.
 
. . . And the First Lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton's foreign trips have something of a routine, and today, as she has in more than 20 countries, the First Lady was host to a forum of women who are leaders here. Aides to Mrs. Clinton say these events are hit or miss: for every stimulating discussion, there is a stilted encounter.
Today probably rated as a miss. Despite a formidable lineup of business people, educators and government officials, the discussion never got off the ground. Instead, the panelists read long statements, many of which simply affirmed that equality of the sexes is enshrined in Vietnam's Constitution.
After listening for more than an hour, Mrs. Clinton looked like a Senator sitting through a filibuster. "Let me thank the panelists for a thorough discussion of the issues," she said with noticeable exasperation.
Mrs. Clinton took mild issue with the assertion that women have equal rights in Vietnam merely because equality is guaranteed in the Constitution. But she seemed eager to explore the role that women play in the Vietnamese economy and society, which is greater than in many countries.
"What is different is there is a history of women working alongside men, fighting alongside men," Mrs. Clinton said.
 
Diplomatic Chuckle
At one point during his travels, President Clinton chatted with a reporter about Warren M. Christopher, his former secretary of state, who opened diplomatic relations with Vietnam on a trip to the country in 1995.
"I bet Chris wishes he was back here right now," Mr. Clinton said with a chuckle.
Mr. Christopher, of course, is in a quagmire halfway around the world, leading Vice President Al Gore's battle to determine who won the state of Florida, and the right to succeed Mr. Clinton.

HEADLINE: COUNTING THE VOTE: THE OVERVIEW;
BUSH'S LEAD STANDS AT 930 AFTER OVERSEAS COUNT

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE

DATELINE: TALLAHASSEE, Fla., Nov. 18

 BODY:
Gov. George W. Bush's lead in Florida more than tripled today as all absentee ballots from overseas were opened and tallied. But his campaign was unable to claim the victory it had expected, as both sides awaited a hearing on Monday in the Florida Supreme Court.
Just as Republicans had predicted, Mr. Bush received an overwhelming share of the overseas ballots, which came in from military personnel and Floridians living abroad, leaving Vice President Al Gore with a far more difficult obstacle to hurdle. 
 Official but uncertified figures from all 67 counties released by the Florida elections division today showed that Mr. Bush had gained 1,380 votes, or 64 percent of the overseas ballots, while Mr. Gore gained 750 votes.
That left Mr. Bush with an overall Florida lead of 930 votes, more than triple the size of his lead before the overseas ballots were counted. All counties were required to report their absentee totals by noon today, and the two campaigns spent the morning trading accusations of misconduct and manipulation over several hundred overseas ballots that were discarded because of postmark disputes.
In Austin, Tex., the Bush campaign held a news conference this afternoon at which Gov. Marc Racicot of Montana issued some of the harshest charges yet against the conduct of the hand vote count, spelling out complaints that included ballots being used as fans and punch holes covered with tape.
Mr. Racicot relayed stories from Republican observers in Florida who said they had seen Bush ballots being put in piles with Gore ballots and chads being knocked out of ballots, allowing the ballots to be counted for Mr. Gore. "This is a process that is completely untrustworthy," he said.
Democrats in Florida said a few minor incidents in Palm Beach had been blown up into a nonexistent trend by Republicans. They contend that the Bush campaign, having lost the legal battle to prevent the hand counts, is now trying to smear the process with accusations of chaos and fraud, and urged an end to the political rhetoric.
The charges and countercharges came a day after an order from the state's highest court prohibited Katherine Harris, the Florida secretary of state, from certifying all votes in Florida, including the absentee ballots, after the noon deadline today. At that point, Mr. Bush would probably have claimed Florida's 25 electors and the presidency for himself, putting the Democrats in the uncomfortable position of having to file a legal challenge to the election after it had been certified.
But the court ruled that Ms. Harris could not certify the election until after it had heard arguments on whether manual recounts in three Florida counties were legal. That hearing is scheduled for 2 p.m. Monday, and the Gore campaign submitted its first briefs to the court this afternoon urging that the certification be halted until all hand counts are completed.
"The question before this court is as fundamental as it is straightforward: whether lawfully cast and counted ballots are to be included in a vote total that will resolve an issue of paramount national importance -- the selection of the president of the United States," the campaign's brief said.
It goes on to say, "This court should direct the secretary of state to include the results of the three manual recounts now under way in the certified election returns, or at the very least, it should instruct her not to certify the result until those manual recounts can be completed and properly reviewed."
The Bush campaign's response is due on Sunday afternoon.
At the same time, the hand counts in Broward and Palm Beach Counties continued today, and the Miami-Dade County canvassing board decided this morning to begin counting its half-million ballots on Monday -- a task that board members estimated could take two weeks, including weekends, with a Thanksgiving Day break.
The board in Miami-Dade hopes to assemble 25 two-person teams of county employees to do the counts, but was having trouble finding enough people.
With Mr. Bush's lead having grown so large, the manual inspection of ballots will have to turn up a substantial number of previously uncounted votes for Mr. Gore if he has any hope of claiming victory here, even if he does win in the Florida Supreme Court.
For example, in Broward County, a Democratic stronghold that is vital to Mr. Gore's chances, the vice president had picked up only 79 votes in hand counts of 43 percent of the county's precincts. If his gains should continue at that rate in the rest of county, he would add only 186 votes through the manual recount.
A group of academic statisticians working with Florida Democrats has projected that Mr. Gore will pick up only about half the votes he needs in the three hand counts, The Miami Herald reported today, not enough to counter the lead Mr. Bush has now built up in the absentee ballots.
One of those cited in the report, Bruce Hansen, an economist at the University of Wisconsin, estimated that a hand recount might be able to produce new results from perhaps 10 percent of the 9,000 uncounted ballots in Palm Beach County.
Mr. Hansen said he was not working for the Democrats but had shared his results with professors who were.
If the added votes were to break along the lines of the original tallies, that would produce a net gain of somewhere between 200 and 400 votes for Mr. Gore in Palm Beach County, he estimated -- more if bulging or "pregnant" punch holes were counted too.
"If you add all of the forecasts of the three big counties, it's going to be lucky if Gore gets the numbers he needs," Professor Hansen said in a telephone interview with The New York Times today.
"It will be really, really a squeaker," he said. "It's just incredible how close this is to a tie."
Earlier in the week, Mr. Gore's forces said they might have a chance at an even split of the absentee votes, predicting that many Floridians living in Israel would cast ballots for a ticket that included Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, who is Jewish. But Republicans predicted all along that the overseas votes would break in their direction, just as they did for Senator Bob Dole in the presidential race of 1996.
Karen P. Hughes, the communications director for Mr. Bush, said the governor was "pleased" that his lead had increased with the absentee ballots.
"We are hopeful that once the Florida Supreme Court has heard arguments in this case, the laws of Florida will prevail and the election will be certified," Ms. Hughes said.
By this morning, when it became evident that Mr. Bush was winning nearly twice as many overseas votes as Mr. Gore, the Democrats could argue only that the number was lower than the Republicans had expected.
Each side accused the other of throwing out legitimate overseas ballots in county-by-county disputes over postmarks and proper markings of the ballots.
An Associated Press survey showed that while 2,203 overseas ballots were counted, 1,420 were discarded.
Counties applied differing standards to the acceptance of the ballots, with some rejecting ballots -- particularly those from the military -- that had no postmarks, and others following the secretary of state's advice that they be accepted.
Florida law requires postmarks on absentee ballots, but federal law says the military must mail the ballots of its personnel without postage.
Republicans charged that Democrats were trying to throw out as many overseas ballots as possible in the belief that doing so would reduce Mr. Bush's lead.
Indeed, according to an analysis of The Associated Press survey, 60 percent of the ballots were thrown out in counties that were carried by Mr. Gore, and of those that remained, Mr. Gore held a slight edge. In counties carried by Mr. Bush, only 29 percent of the ballots were thrown out, and those that remained went for Bush by a better than 2-to-1 margin.
"We're distressed that it appears there's a statewide effort on behalf of Al Gore to discredit military votes," said Mindy Tucker, a spokeswoman for Mr. Bush's campaign. "The Florida Democratic Party has been sending out instructions to their people in the counties on how to protest these votes."
The Republicans released a statement from retired Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, who said it was a "sad day" when military personnel were denied their right to vote because of a technicality.
But Jenny Backus, a spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee, said the decisions on whether to accept or reject ballots were made by independently appointed elected officials, not by the campaigns.
"Both sides were out in the counties, but the final decision was up to the elected boards," she said. "It's surprising to me, after a week in which they got rejected in the Florida courts for challenging the authority of locally elected Florida election officials, that they are once again doing so this weekend."
The sprawling teams of local and national lawyers assembled by both sides stayed up all night in law offices around town, conducting legal research and using hastily rented computers to prepare their briefs for the state's high court.
Although the court will be hearing three consolidated cases, the principal issue at stake before the court is whether the secretary of state has the authority to reject manual recounts submitted after the usual seven-day period for certifying election results.
Last week the court permitted the hand counts to continue, but it has not yet taken a position on the central issue of the secretary of state's authority.
A trial judge ruled that Ms. Harris could not reject the hand counts arbitrarily simply because they were late, but said she was allowed to reject them based on her own considered legal criteria.
Democrats, putting their last hope in the manual recounts, have been playing for time in the hope that Mr. Gore would overtake Mr. Bush in the hand counts. At that point, they said, Ms. Harris would be unable to reject a result that could overturn the election.
But Mr. Bush's sharp surge in the overseas ballots may eliminate that possibility.
Thus far the Florida Supreme Court, which is made up of seven justices appointed by Democratic governors, has issued two decisions considered favorable to Mr. Gore. But Monday will be the first time in the case when they hear oral arguments, and they are well aware that the world will be watching every moment, and every question they raise in the hearing, to detect any hints of the ruling to come.
The court session will be televised live, and the court will also make the session available live on the Internet.

HEADLINE: CLINTON IN VIETNAM: THE AMERICAN MISSING;
Clinton Journeys to Where Pilot Died in 1967

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: TIEN CHAU, Vietnam, Nov. 18

 BODY:
The last transmission anyone heard from Lt. Col. Lawrence G. Evert's F-105D Thunderbird was only three words long: "I'm hit hard." Moments later, an American flier on a bombing run here saw what he thought was the explosion of an aircraft hitting the rice paddies.
That was 33 years and 10 days ago. It took until this year for American investigators to narrow the search for Colonel Evert's plane to just outside this impoverished village, 17 miles northwest of Hanoi, the capital, and to get approval to dig it up. 
 Then, in the weeks before President Clinton's arrival in Vietnam on Thursday, the soft, acidic earth of Tien Chau began giving up bits of wiring, bolts and plastic, clearly from an aircraft, and finally what forensic experts believe are small amounts of human remains.
They have not yet been identified.
Nonetheless, in one of the most emotional moments of his presidency, President Clinton today drove into the Vietnamese countryside, past water buffalo, a Japanese motorcycle factory and farmers tending their flooded fields, to find the site. He hiked along a bamboo boardwalk to the place where some older villagers still remember seeing a plume of smoke after an American fighter was shot down by antiaircraft fire.
He brought with him the downed pilot's two sons, who spent Friday sifting mud through fine mesh, searching for the father they last saw when he flew out of Phoenix on a hot summer day in 1967. "When we were 6 and 8 years old," David Evert said today, choking back tears as he gestured toward his older brother, Dan, "we'd talk about how we would come to Vietnam and rescue him. We kind of feel that we're doing that now."
Mr. Clinton's trip across the pocked dirt roads of this poverty-stricken section of Vietnam was intended as a vivid demonstration of how a new era has arrived, one in which Americans and Vietnamese work together, six days a week, finishing the muddy and emotionally draining business of accounting for 1,498 Americans still listed as missing in action here.
Standing in mud-covered work shoes, Mr. Clinton today called the joint search for remains a coming together of former enemies that was "unprecedented in human history." But like most of Mr. Clinton's trip here, the somber trek into the paddies was a reminder that piecing together America's relations with Vietnam is as slow and agonizing a process as looking for the remnants of Colonel Evert's fighter.
"Look, neither side is ever going to fully get past it," said Pete Peterson, the former prisoner of war who now serves as American ambassador here. "Reminders of the war are everywhere. You drive by them every day. But we can't change the past and we can change the future, and bringing the president here to talk about what we can do together -- I think that opens a lot of minds here."
It is far too early to tell what will come of Mr. Clinton's three-day visit to Vietnam. For all the enthusiasm his visit has generated among young people -- 60 percent of Vietnamese were born after 1970 -- the Communist government in Hanoi remains deeply suspicious of American intentions. Engagement sounds fine, officials say, as long as it does not loosen the party's control of the country or cause economic upheaval.
In particular, the kind of engagement that seems fine to the Hanoi authorities is the one happening out here in the rice paddies of Tien Chau. It is, without question, a remarkable sight, here and five other places around the country where Vietnamese are digging for remains of missing Americans.
Scores of villagers have signed up for jobs slicing away at the mud beneath the recently drained paddy, using a jerry-rigged device called a cheese cutter. They have a lot of cutting ahead of them: Colonel Evert's plane is believed to have tunneled a hole at least 16 feet deep.
With hardly a word, the workers put mud in buckets and pass it along by hand to a wooden platform where dozens of young women sift it, looking for anything that resembles bones or manufactured parts. Hundreds have been found, few are larger than the size of a thumb.
From the site, the workers can see a long metal railroad bridge that American forces were trying to destroy that night. Colonel Evert's plane was the fourth and last in a formation, and no one knows if he dropped his ordnance. They know he never pulled up to head south, and no one saw him eject or spotted a parachute open. A crew member on a nearby plane reported that the aircraft had been hit on the left rear fuselage by intense antiaircraft fire, an image that seemed hard to imagine today on the peaceful paddies, where children were laughing and playing on the narrow dirt road and watching the man from America who arrived with roughly 40 cars, vans and buses.
Five days after the crash, Colonel Evert's fourth child, Elizabeth, was born. His widow, Wanda, raised the children alone.
While nothing conclusive has been found, investigators seem quite certain that what they have tripped upon are the fractured remains of the F-105D. "This is a chance for them to take their family home," Mr. Clinton said today, after touring the site with his daughter, Chelsea, and his wife, Senator-elect Hillary Rodham Clinton, who said nothing in public.
David Evert said today that he had been surprised at the greeting he got from the local townspeople who came out to the site. They asked him about his other relatives, and details about his father. "They wanted to know how old we were when our father crashed," said Mr. Evert, now 39. "It's amazing how hard they work, and how dedicated they are."
It will be months, maybe years, before the Evert family knows for sure what has been dug up. DNA testing will have to be conducted on the tiny amount of remains, which will be sent to Hawaii. Plane parts will be studied for evidence that the aircraft is the one everyone thinks it is. "We can wait," said Mr. Evert, a television cameraman. "We've waited 33 years not knowing much. What's a few more months?"

HEADLINE: COVER STORY;
Bio-Tweaked and on the Run, But Her Heart Will Go On

BYLINE: By BERNARD WEINRAUB

 BODY:
JAMES CAMERON was not initially interested in making a science fiction series like "Dark Angel" for television.
 
 "I felt that science fiction on television doesn't usually work - the sets always look so cheesy," said Mr. Cameron, who struck gold with "Titanic," the 1997 blockbuster that not only won 11 Academy Awards but grossed a record $1.8 billion around the world. "I was leery. You want to create a vast future world, and it comes out looking less than that. I kept wanting to do a straight dramatic series."
 Obviously Mr. Cameron, whose earlier hits include "Aliens" and "The Terminator," was king of the hill in Hollywood and could have made virtually any film he wanted after "Titantic." But instead of plunging into another movie, he took some time off.
 "I felt I had been through two years of hell and it was, like, 'O. K., fine, I'm taking diving lessons and learning to paint. I'm taking some time for myself.' But I was thinking about television too."
 Mr. Cameron, who is 46, said he had yeared for years to involve himself in a television project but would pursue one only with an experienced writer-producer who, as he said, "had the chops, a top guy." That guy was a longtime friend, Charles Eglee, 47, who met Mr. Cameron in the early 1980's when they were both working for the cult filmmaker Roger Corman. Mr. Eglee went on to join Steven Bochoo Productions and work on series like "L.A. Law," "Murder One" and "N.Y.P.D. Blue."
 The two friends spent months sitting in the garden of Mr. Cameron's Malibu home discussing potential drama series: a hospital show, a series about a sheriff in a California border town, a family drama. But Mr. Eglee kept pressing Mr. Cameron about a science fiction show.
 "This was Jim's first foray into television, and my feeling was if his name was going to be on a TV show, you're making a certain promise to the audience," said Mr. Eglee. "This was going to be a show for Fox, and we were thinking of that particular young demographic. Ultimately we were drawn to the idea of an urban youth ensemble. And Jim said: 'What if she's genetically engineered? And she's a fugitive on the run?' And soon we were spinning and creating that world." (The initial title was "Experimental Girl.")
 "Dark Angel" - on Tuesday nights at 9 on Fox - stars an unknown, Jessica Alba, who was selected from more than 1,000 actresses, as Max, a genetically altered teenager with plenty of attitude. Max works as a bicycle messenger in the year 2019 in an anarchic Seattle half-devastated by an electromagnetic pulse set off by terrorists that has crippled the global economy. (The idea came from the apocalyptic Y2K articles in magazines and newspapers last year.) Max is on the run from the evil military program that crated her and several other genetically altered beings. Working with a wheelchair-bound underground journalist, played by Michael Weatherly, she tries to search for her bioengineered brethren, avoid capture and fight the dark forces of corruption around her.
 What led Mr. Cameron to change his mind about working on a science fiction series for television, besides a strong interest in larger-than-life themes, was his 7-year-old daughter. In creating Max, the 19-year-old messenger, Mr. Cameron and Mr. Eglee, who has two daughters, are linking some aspects of the fictional character to their children.
 "Now that I have a daughter, I guess I'm thinking ahead of time of what the life experiences are going to be that she's going to be going through in a few years, and that's going to get fed into Max's character," said Mr. Cameron.
 The show is a risk for Mr. Cameron and an even bigger risk for Fox, which has failed in recent years to build a science fiction franchise following "The X-Files," even with expensive shows like "Millennium" and "The Visitor." The two-hour pilot of "Dark Angel," shown on Oct. 3, was budgeted at $10 million, twice as much as a typical two-hour pilot. For Mr. Cameron the stakes are high because several other high-profile filmmakers, notably Steven Spielberg, have tried and failed to make the leap into television. (Mr. Spielberg's 1993-95 underwater drama, "Sea Quest D.S.V.," and his 1996-97 police drama, "High Incident," were both disappointments.)
 So far, the Cameron-Eglee series is viewed within Fox as a success. It has averaged a steady 14.3 million viewers each week and is No. 1 in the time slot among teenagers. It also seems to be holding at the No. 2 slot among adults 18 to 49, following NBC's "Frasier," which is on from 9 to 9:30 p.m. (Last year, Fox's "Party of Five" drew only 8.1 million viewers in the same time period.)
 Giles S. Lundberg, senior vice president for research and marketing at Fox, said the ratings for the show were impressive. "The show has very quickly appeared to establish itself as the program of choice on Tuesday night for teens and young adults," he said.
 Mr. Cameron said his voyage into television had been, at least for now, a productive one, and he wants to do more television with Mr. Eglee. (He will eventually detach himself from "Dark Angel," he said, to move onto some still unspecified feature films, leaving the project entirely in the hands of Mr. Eglee.)
 "What I like about television is the sheer energy of it," said Mr. Cameron. "It's also the fact that it's not one big throw of the dice like movies. You may work on a film for a year or two, and it gets slammed into a theater on a Friday. And by late Friday evening, or certainly by Saturday night, you know with dead certainty whether or not the last couple of years of yourlife have been worthwhile or not."
 Television is different, he says. "You're not wiped out in a single weekend. It's a fluid process. You can react to what the audience likes or dislikes. You can adjust. You can roll with the punches. In a way it's freeing. You can grow. I want to do more."

HEADLINE: First Woman to Lead Ivy League College Is the Highest-Paid University President

BYLINE: By JODI WILGOREN

 BODY:
The president of the University of Pennsylvania, Judith Rodin, the first woman to run an Ivy League institution, had the highest annual salary and benefits of any college president in the country in 1998-99, receiving $655,557, a survey by The Chronicle of Higher Education shows.
Dr. Rodin tops a list of presidents with steadily climbing compensation packages. Six collected more than $500,000 in 1998-99, compared with only one in 1995-96, and 74 -- nearly double the number three years ago -- earned at least $300,000. In addition, Harry C. Payne, the retiring president of Williams College, received $878,222, most of it in long-term retirement benefits. 
 Of the 10 best-compensated college presidents, four were in the New York area: L. Jay Oliva of New York University, $639,633; Richard C. Levin of Yale University, $525,687; George C. Rupp of Columbia University, $500,204; and Harold T. Shapiro of Princeton University, $456,170.
The survey of 479 private colleges was compiled from tax forms the schools are required to make public, and 1998-99 is the latest year available. The figures include salary and routine benefits like health insurance, but typically do not include perquisites like housing, cars or speaking fees. The leaders of public universities are typically paid less.
The median package was $185,721.
"It's a splendid thing when there is a prestigious salary list and a woman is on top of it," said Sheila Wellington, president of Catalyst, a New York-based group that studies women in business. A recent Catalyst study showed that 4.1 percent of the 2,500 top earners in Fortune 500 companies were women. More broadly, Catalyst estimates that women earn about 77 cents for every dollar men earn.
"Judith Rodin is an exceptional person," said Ms. Wellington, who was secretary of Yale when Dr. Rodin was the provost. "And it's wonderful to see exceptional people achieving up to their potential and being recognized and rewarded for it."
Experts in compensation and higher education attributed the swell in presidential salaries to the general health of the economy, which has sent many university endowments skyrocketing and helped innumerable presidents post record fund-raising successes. They said some universities feel they are competing with the corporate sector -- where the average compensation for chief executives was $11.9 million in 1999 -- and the bulging compensation packages reflect a transformation of the presidency in recent years.
"The technical title is still president, but you hear people talking about the C.E.O.," noted David Breneman, dean of the school of education at the University of Virginia. "We've adopted this corporate terminology."
Indeed, James S. Riepe, chairman of the board of trustees at Penn, referred to the university as "a very large company," with a $3 billion budget and 20,000 employees. And he explained why Dr. Rodin deserved the one-year rise of $107,000 in salary and benefits.
"We think we're getting value for what we're paying her," said Mr. Riepe, whose job as vice chairman of T. Rowe Price paid him $2.8 million in salary and bonus last year, according to Business Week magazine.
Martin Lipton, chairman of the board at New York University, credited Dr. Oliva with building the school's international reputation since he became president in 1991, and says the trustees pay no attention to where their institution falls on the annual list.
"It's all about the person," Mr. Lipton said. "The university is his entire life. He's there day and night, playing basketball with the kids. He is the essence of the university."
At the other end of the spectrum is Daniel L. Ritchie, who refused to accept a salary when he took over as chancellor of the University of Denver in 1989. Mr. Ritchie, the former chief executive of the Westinghouse Broadcasting Company, has instead donated more than $50 million of land to the university, a private school with about 9,500 students that was founded in 1964.
Unlike Dr. Rodin and Dr. Oliva, Mr. Ritchie happily agreed to a telephone interview.
"I really don't need the money," he said. "I've given away most of what I have, but I still have enough that I don't need the money to live."
Mike Jarvis feels differently. Mr. Jarvis, the men's basketball coach at St. John's University, was the highest-paid coach in the survey, at $860,093, more than any college president except the retiring Mr. Payne.
"I think I earn every dime that I make," said Mr. Jarvis, who, as of Friday, had a 54-18 record since arriving at St. John's three years ago. Mr. Jarvis disputed The Chronicle's figures, saying he knows several coaches with higher salaries than his.
"My definition of salary is what I get in my hands," he said. "There are some people who work for a dollar a year, because that's all they need. I'm sure that there are presidents that on paper make less than I make but at the end of the month they have more money than I have."

 Architecture is not like sausage, something you are inclined to like only if you don't know how it's made. The process by which architecture is made is actually quite enticing. And most people don't know the first thing about it. Even people who love buildings tend to see them as pure and perfect finished objects, not as the product of months, even years, of anguish, debate, and trial and error. Accident can determine architectural form as much as intention, and who is to say how and why an architect prefers one shape over another?
"Frank O. Gehry: Outside In," by Jan Greenberg and Sandra Jordan, does more to address these questions than any book I know that has been written for adults. This is not a biography for children, though it contains a great deal of information about Gehry's life, and it is not a guide to his buildings, though there are spectacular color photographs of many of his best works, including the extraordinary Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, the project that has probably done more than any other single building to make architecture a subject of wide popular passion today.
This book is a journey through the creative process. It is the best introduction to Gehry's architecture that we have. Maybe I should go farther and say it is one of the best introductions to architecture that we have. Like many of the best children's books, "Frank O. Gehry: Outside In" gets to the heart of its subject without any of the obfuscations of books written for adults. It brings you into Gehry's life and into his work, and it addresses the way each of these things has affected the other.
The authors, who also wrote a remarkable book about the artist Chuck Close, do use Gehry's life for a kind of basic narrative structure. We are told, often in his own words, about his childhood in Canada, about his family's financial woes, about his life as a truck driver as his family attempted an economic recovery in Los Angeles, and then about his growing awakening to architecture in general and to the artistic culture of Southern California in particular. "As he searched for his own style, he realized he had more in common with the methods of cutting-edge West Coast artists than with the standard fare of other architects," the authors say. And then they quote Gehry: "The artists were working with inexpensive materials -- broken wood and paper -- and they were making beauty."
Gehry is an easy conversationalist, not the prima donna his recent celebrity might suggest, and his words are often endearing. In one of my favorite sections, Greenberg and Jordan ask Gehry about his own house in Santa Monica, a conventional Dutch colonial that he covered with chain-link fencing, plywood and corrugated metal. "Buildings look more interesting before they are finished," Gehry says, explaining why he left the ceiling beams and joists and some of the pipes exposed. "If things look good when they are installed, why cover them up?"
I am not sure how easy it is for children to understand what Gehry means when he says: "Life is chaotic, dangerous and surprising. Buildings should reflect it." But I know that this remark can provoke a fascinating conversation among all but the youngest children about why certain buildings appeal to them and others do not, and how accurately it takes us into Gehry's way of thinking. Greenberg and Jordan understand that Gehry is not some kind of crazy sculptor, but very much an architect who is concerned with fulfilling the needs of his clients, and they devote a fair amount of space to explaining exactly how he does this and comes up with buildings that look so different from everybody else's.
Their book includes several of Gehry's best projects from the days before he became an international superstar, like the law school of Loyola University in downtown Los Angeles, a village of simple shapes arranged around a small public square, which they juxtapose with a photograph of the Roman Forum, making the connection absolutely clear. Gehry loved the way the Forum was a collection of pieces, many in ruins, and the way it tied his project, symbolically at least, to the origins of the law.
For one of his residential clients, who warmly remembered growing up near the Griffith Park Observatory in Los Angeles, Gehry designed a house that is also a kind of village, but with a copper dome over the largest section to echo the observatory. "I try to realize my clients' fantasies and create something special for them," Gehry is quoted as saying in a chapter that I love most of all for its title: "Every Building Has a Story."
Most important of all, Greenberg and Jordan make clear how slow and difficult the design process is. "After a number of quick sketches Gehry makes the first of many models," they write. "Again and again he revises. 'I'll move a wall on a model, look at it for two weeks, then move it again. And I worry about things. I'm like a mother hen.' "
"Outside In" is illustrated with a mix of first-rate color photographs (including a superb set of the Guggenheim in Bilbao), Gehry's own drawings, and computer-generated drawings that explain the role of software in creating many of Gehry's unusual shapes. It ends with a discussion of Gehry's struggle, after the acclaim of Bilbao, to avoid being pushed into making the same building over and over again. This may be one of the few books for young readers to address honestly not just the payoffs of artistic success but also the risks.
Readers who are not ready for "Frank O. Gehry: Outside In" (probably anyone under the age of 10) may well enjoy Michael J. Crosbie and Steve and Kit Rosenthal's "Arches to Zigzags," a kind of architectural dictionary in rhyme. The world does not need another A B C book, but this one is so beautifully photographed, and so clever in its choices, that you cannot not make room for it on your shelf. "W," for example, doesn't stand for window, but for widow's walk, which is illustrated by an elegant 1819 house in Salem, Mass., while "R" is for ruin, shown by the Wupatki National Monument, a 12th-century site in Arizona. The architectural terms are illustrated with color images of buildings as different as H. H. Richardson's Ames Free Library in North Easton, Mass. ("arch"), an Art Deco hotel in Miami Beach ("neon") and the John Hancock Center in Chicago ("X-bracing"), and the rhymes are clear, fun and not too cute.
ALAS, there are no limits to cuteness in "Roberto the Insect Architect," by Nina Laden. This is the tale of a termite who wants to be an architect so he can follow in the footsteps of "Hank Floyd Mite and Fleas van der Rohe." Those names tell you all you need to know about this rather insipid story, which is mainly a string of puns that exist solely to amuse adults, or children whose reading level is light-years beyond this. Roberto defies his fellow termites, who doubt that he can become an architect, and after he makes it big he gets the rewards of a television interview with Barbara Waterbugs and an offer for the film rights to his life from Steven Shieldbug.
Humbug.

HEADLINE: College Endowments Learn to Live With Risk

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
SOME years it is the football coach. Others, the Nobel Prize-winning physicist. This year, however, the biggest celebrities among college faculty members and administrators sit not in the field houses or the science labs but in the investment offices, where they have guided endowments to record gains.
The group that oversees Duke University's endowment steered its $1.7 billion pool of capital to a 59 percent gain in the year ended June 30. The University of Notre Dame's investments gained 58 percent in the same period, those of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology jumped more than 50 percent, and at least six other large universities recorded investment returns exceeding 40 percent. Harvard's 32 percent profit generated $4.6 billion for the university, more than the total endowment of all but seven other American colleges. 
 While other investors have enjoyed similarly stellar returns in the last few years, the profits reaped recently by university endowments contrast with the staid reputation that such funds have long had, particularly among alumni eager to see their contributions invested wisely.
Those profits were generated by taking no small amount of risk -- including a heavy reliance on speculative venture capital, or private equity, where investors bet on companies at such an early stage that an entire investment can be wiped out before a product or service even gets to market.
Propelled by the roaring stock market, however, venture capital has produced triple-digit returns for many endowments by letting them make early bets on companies like eBay, Phone.com and Sycamore Networks. The biggest risk often seemed to be in having too few such investments.
Until now. Even some of the biggest fans of venture investments are warning that the rich recent returns are not likely to last.
"A lot of the money going into private equity now, I think, is going to generate very disappointing returns," said David F. Swensen, the chief investment officer at Yale and the man whom many of his peers credit with forging the new theory of aggressive endowment investment.
Indeed, recent stock market weakness, including a 40 percent fall in the Nasdaq composite index since its peak in March, has caused private-equity portfolios to give back some of the gains and raised questions about when and how well those investments actually diversify a portfolio.
Yet many colleges and universities that previously failed to move much money into the riskier assets are now trying to do so. Those schools, including the University of Pennsylvania and the University of California, face the danger of buying overpriced investments just as their value is beginning to fall.
"Institutions that were primarily focused on large-cap U.S. stocks and bonds are now saying, 'Maybe I'll make some investments in these other places,' " said Todd E. Petzel, chief investment officer for the Commonfund, which invests more than $26 billion for 1,400 colleges and universities in the United States and Canada. "But this may be an awkward time to do that. An awful lot of people are coming to this party awfully late, and they have experience only in good equity markets."
BOTH the success and the peril wrought by the performance of venture capital investments is evident at Notre Dame, where the university's venture capital investments rose 400 percent in value last year. At one point, they accounted for about 40 percent of its $3 billion endowment.
By late last month, that had fallen to about 35 percent, in part because of the sale of some stock holdings, said Scott Malpass, who manages the fund. Also taking a toll, however, was the Nasdaq's tumble, which cut the value of many companies that had only recently graduated from venture capital investments to publicly traded stocks and were still in the endowment's portfolios.
While the recent stock market decline has dented the financial strength of some universities, most are still better off than they were a decade ago, when colleges around the country were cutting academic programs and letting faculty and administrative jobs go unfilled because of financial woes.
Today, some of the wealthiest universities are experiencing a period of great prosperity. With hundreds of millions of dollars unexpectedly in hand, institutions are enjoying an unrivaled period of building and expansion. That growth has untold economic benefits for the communities around colleges and universities.
"The performance of the endowment in the last several years has certainly given us the ability to do new things," said Jeremy Knowles, the dean of the faculty of arts and sciences at Harvard. Among them are new academic initiatives like creating centers for the study of genomics and American political science. More mundane tasks "that should have been done 85 years ago" have also been attended to, he said, including air-conditioning the rooms holding valuable library collections.
So far, in most cases, increased spending has not come at the expense of the endowments' capital. Yale's endowment has grown to $10 billion from $1 billion when Mr. Swensen arrived in 1985, even as its contribution to the annual budget has risen to nearly 30 percent from 10 percent, he noted. Yet that contribution still accounts for less than 5 percent of the endowment's assets.
Clearly, if the value of the endowment were to plunge, Yale's budget would feel the pinch, as would the economy of New Haven. But Mr. Swensen said the portfolio's diversity -- with investments in hedge funds, the value of which should rise if the market falls, and real assets like timber, which do not track the stock market as closely as, say, corporate bonds -- will smooth out any short-term jolts.
Institutions that are less wealthy would suffer more in a long slump, of course, particularly if endowment income makes up a significant share of their operating budgets.
For this reason, even enthusiastic advocates of alternative investments are advising their universities not to expect that their wealth will continue to expand forever.
"It is important that we not delude ourselves into thinking that double-digit returns will persist indefinitely," Jack R. Meyer said in his annual report on the Harvard endowment. Mr. Meyer is chief executive of the Harvard Management Company, which oversees the 8,600 funds that make up the endowment.
Investing in venture capital and other exotic assets has only recently begun to catch on broadly at American universities, according to the National Association of College and University Business Officers, which each year surveys endowments at more than 500 American colleges.
As of June 1999, the end of the most recent fiscal year for which complete figures are available, only 8 percent of the average college endowment was invested in alternative assets like real estate, hedge funds, oil and gas partnerships, distressed securities, arbitrage opportunities and private equity, which includes venture capital and leveraged buyouts. Such investments make up more than 20 percent of larger endowment portfolios, including those of Harvard and Yale.
AND where the average endowment has 54 percent invested in American stocks and 24 percent in bonds, larger endowments put far less money there -- an average of 43 percent and 18 percent, respectively.
By taking bigger risks in a bull market, big endowments have outperformed their smaller peers. Endowments with more than $1 billion in assets gained an average of 18 percent annually from 1995 through 1999, according to the survey by the business officers association. Those with $300 million to $1 billion in assets gained 16.9 percent, and those under $300 million gained less than 16.5 percent, on average.
Mr. Swensen of Yale, who laid out his arguments for long-term investments in venture capital and other nontraditional assets in a recent book, "Pioneering Portfolio Management" (Free Press, 2000), has been advocating their use for years.
A professorial man who eagerly shares the credit for Yale's endowment success with his investment team, Mr. Swensen said his belief in the value of nontraditional endowment assets came out of his review of the long-term needs, goals and methods used by portfolio managers.
Endowments are, he observed, the ultimate long-term investors, with no plans to cash out, ever. Unlike pension funds, they have no guaranteed benefits for which they are responsible. Most universities pay out a certain percentage of the endowment to support the budget each year, but that payout can be changed, usually by a vote of the trustees.
Mr. Swensen concluded that rather than favoring predictability in choosing investments, endowments should embrace risk, and they can do so in a way that is not available to many other institutions and individuals.
Endowments can afford to own risky investments in volume, he said. They can buy commercial property in one area and residential space in another, for example, where the local economies are fueled by different industries. The values of those investments are more likely to be independent of each other than are corporate bonds and domestic stocks.
Recognizing the need to invest in other types of assets was one thing; doing so was another. When it came time to try to actively manage a portfolio of unusual, alternative investments, "we did not have all the tools we needed" to invest effectively, Mr. Swensen said.
SO, he built them. "Part of our success at Yale is the ability to create tools that didn't exist before or to use them more aggressively," Mr. Swensen said. Unable to find enough qualified firms that managed real estate, oil and gas properties and other classes of alternative assets, the Yale investment office under Mr. Swensen has put "18 to 20 firms into business" managing portions of its specialized portfolios.
When Mr. Swensen arrived from Wall Street, two-thirds of Yale's endowment was invested in publicly traded shares of American companies. Today, that proportion is down to 15 percent. In the same span, private equity has grown from almost nothing to 25 percent of the portfolio, 10 percentage points of it in venture capital partnerships focused on technology start-ups and 15 percentage points in leveraged buyouts.
As Mr. Swensen delved into venture capital and other alternatives at Yale, Jack Meyer was doing much the same thing at Harvard.
Mr. Meyer began his effort to improve Harvard's investment process by focusing on how much it cost to invest in the most desirable assets, and whether that cost was excessive for endowments, given their nature.
"I think institutions often overpay for liquidity," he said. Because endowments never need access to most of their investments in the form of cash, he said, there is relatively less risk for them in a leveraged buyout or some other high-return asset that cannot be sold quickly.
While they have both embraced alternative investments, Mr. Meyer and Mr. Swensen take fundamentally different approaches on how to oversee their portfolios. Mr. Swensen's office, on Yale's campus, consists of a small staff that oversees the portfolio strategy, but leaves the picking and trading of actual investments to outside money managers. Harvard, in contrast, directly invests much of its billions, and Mr. Meyer commands a staff of about 140 professionals housed on the edge of Boston's financial district, across the river from Cambridge.
Because of their common investment philosophies, the results at Harvard and Yale have been similarly compelling.
Harvard's endowment, for example, has gained an average of 23 percent annually over the last five years. That is about 4 percentage points above the annual benchmark return that Harvard would expect if it simply matched its target rate of return in each of the various asset classes in its portfolio.
Put another way, if Harvard had earned just those targeted returns over the last five years, the university would have $6 billion less than it now has.
The venture capital profits of Harvard and Yale have now attracted others, including the University of California, which recently raised the portion of its $5.1 billion endowment eligible for venture investments to 7 percent from 2 percent.
Another faithful advocate is Eugene J. McDonald, who retired as president of the Duke Management Company in September.
PRIVATE capital investments, which at more than 25 percent of the portfolio account for one of the largest portions of Duke's total endowment of $2.7 billion, gained 214 percent in the year ended June 30. Those investments have been so successful that their weighting in the portfolio has grown beyond Duke Management's long-term target of 15 percent; Mr. McDonald said the weighting had been "at or above the 30 percent level" at times during the last fiscal year.
One of the biggest issues aggressive endowment managers face, said Mr. McDonald, is that venture capital "is an asset class that does not easily permit rebalancing." In all but the most recent times, there is a long stretch between investment and payoff.
Venture capital partnerships are typically managed by firms that gather cash from investors, find companies with promising prospects and buy substantial stakes. The venture capital firm's principals often sit on the board and have a direct hand in its management, helping to guide the company toward an eventual initial public offering of stock.
Even then, however, the venture capitalists cannot immediately cash out. Usually, their shares are restricted from trading for a set period after an initial offering; even when the restriction is lifted, the owners can sell only a certain amount of securities each month.
Venture capital funds typically distribute shares, rather than cash, to their investors after an offering, so the universities themselves are left with thousands of shares that they are unable to sell immediately. That can spell trouble in a volatile stock market, as venture investors are left trying to unload shares that move rapidly up and down in price.
To try to reduce the risk at each stage in this process, endowment managers compete to invest with venture capital firms like Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers that have demonstrated they can attract promising new firms and pick winners.
Endowment managers say that failures among the top venture capital partnerships have numbered only a few out of several hundred investments in recent years. But those partnerships often are oversubscribed and unwilling to take on new investors. So while hundreds of venture capital partnerships raised billions of dollars in the last year, endowment managers have been calling on their alumni with Silicon Valley connections for help getting into the best funds, said Craig Carnaroli, treasurer at the University of Pennsylvania.
What makes venture capital investments worth such efforts is the payoff. Equity acquired for pennies a share can be sold for thousands of times as much in just a few years -- if the company survives.
CONSIDER Juniper Networks, which makes telecommunications equipment. In June 1996, the company sold shares to three venture-capital partnerships managed by Kleiner Perkins for the equivalent (adjusted for subsequent stock splits) of less than a penny a share. On June 25, 1999, the company completed its initial public offering, selling its shares at $5.67 apiece. Last month, Juniper's shares peaked at $243 a share.
Investors in the Kleiner Perkins partnerships received a distribution of shares sometime between mid-February and mid-April of this year, when the stock was trading at about $100 on Nasdaq. For those investors, which included Duke, Yale and many of the other large endowments, that price -- less than half the peak -- represented a profit of more than 10,000 percent.
Such returns, having been the rule in the last two years, are by far the exception over longer spans of history. Venture investors are finding that out even now.
Mr. Meyer said it was possible "that returns for the second half of the calendar year will be negative" on venture capital investments.
Indeed, for fiscal 2001, which lasts through next June, he said the entire endowment "could have a negative return year -- something that has not happened since fiscal 1984."
Still, Mr. Meyer said his diversified portfolio "has less risk than one with 65 percent in U.S. stocks and 35 percent in U.S. bonds." That is demonstrated by the recent experience of another Ivy League institution, the University of Pennsylvania.
Penn's $3.3 billion endowment is one of no more than a handful of university funds that lost money last year. Mr. Carnaroli declined to characterize the fall other than saying saying it was "a slight loss at the margin." But when compared with the gains of more than 30 percent experienced by many of the top universities, any loss looks terrible.
Part of the reason for the underperformance is that Penn's endowment has followed a strategy of value investing, buying beaten-down stocks whose financial position, long-term prospects and strategic position in their industry made them appear undervalued.
In recent years, value investing has performed badly when compared with a growth-investing strategy, one that relied more on the rate of growth in earnings or, for profitless Internet companies, in sales.
Penn also suffered because its equity portfolios had almost no correlation with broad American stock indexes like the Standard & Poor's 500, which has gained about 24 percent a year on average over the five years that ended June 30.
Mr. Carnaroli, who joined Penn from Merrill Lynch early this year, said the university had redeployed about one-third of its assets, many of them going from domestic equities to alternative investments.
"We've replaced some managers, and we now have broader exposure to the indexes," he said. "We've turned over one-third of the portfolio in the last 18 months."
But getting into the most desirable venture capital funds at this late date has not been easy. While Penn has been able to invest in some recent funds put together by Kleiner Perkins, "we got only a very small allocation" in those funds, he said.
WITH $3 billion in the bank, Penn is in no danger of going broke. But with each year of little or no growth, inflation eats away at the endowment's value.
In 1993, budget struggles caused in part by poor endowment performance led the university to close three departments. Though the endowment has grown markedly since then, Mr. Carnaroli said, "We still face significant operating pressures."
"We've had extraordinary cost increases, huge growth in our research enterprise and in the costs of things like campus security," he said. "All of those outstrip the growth in inflation."
With universities around the country facing similarly rising expenses and the financial markets jittery, endowment managers are certain to be looking more closely at alternative routes to investment.

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about investments by university endowments in venture capital and other types of private equity referred incorrectly to those of the University of California. While the university changed its policy this year to allow up to 7 percent of its endowment pool to go to such investments, from 2 percent, the change simply brought policy into line with practice. About 5 percent of the endowment's assets have been invested in private equity for several years.

HEADLINE: Environmentalists Applaud Votes in Nassau

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
JOINING a regional and national trend toward increased local spending for open space and environmental programs, Nassau voters in the Towns of North Hempstead and Oyster Bay have approved $45 million in new borrowing for environmental purposes.
This was first time that residents in Nassau municipalities have voted on local proposals for such programs, a point all but eclipsed on Long Island by the tumult following the presidential election and the victory of Hillary Rodham Clinton in her Senate race with Rick A. Lazio. 
 Last week local officials and civic and environmental groups were still expressing surprise and even amazement at the results. The proposals, for $15 million in North Hempstead and $30 million in Oyster Bay, were approved by more than two-to-one margins in both towns.
In Suffolk County, where voters have repeatedly backed town, county and state initiatives to preserve farms and open space, there was disagreement over the impact of the voters' rejection of a proposal to set limits on borrowing to acquire farms and open space.
Officials and environmental groups that lobbied against the Suffolk proposal said it would have sharply curtailed borrowing against future sales-tax revenues for land and farm purchases at a time when development pressure warranted maximum spending. Taking a contrary view, officials supporting the proposal said its defeat meant there could be no borrowing. Now the issue will have to be sorted out by the county Legislature and county lawyers.
Results were more clear-cut in Nassau, where supporters of the town programs said they had feared that the county government's financial crisis and property-tax increases resulting from it would weigh heavily on voters.
"If there had not been all of the major problems with the county fiscal situation, I would have had no question but that North Hempstead would support this kind of effort," said May W. Newburger, the North Hempstead town supervisor, a Democrat who had been only "cautiously optimistic" about the outcome.
The supporters had also worried that a countywide reassessment would raise uncertainties about future tax rates, thus hurting the proposals' chances.
Instead, they said, voters in the two towns were unexpectedly decisive in their support. "I figured there was an appetite, but I had no idea it would be this well received," said Joshua F. Klainberg, the political director of the New York League of Conservation Voters, whose group was one of several that worked for the North Hempstead initiative.
Environmental organizations on Long Island said the town votes proved their long-held opinion that Nassau voters would support environmental spending if given the opportunity, just as voters in Suffolk County have done.
"I cannot tell you how I pushed for this and stumped for this and worked for this," said Bonnie Eisler, an Oyster Bay town councilwoman, a Democrat. "I was so excited we got such overwhelming support. It means we are on the right track."
The Oyster Bay plan, approved for the ballot by the Republican-controlled town board in September, will provide $20 million to acquire environmentally sensitive land and $10 million for park and recreational improvements, said John Venditto, the town supervisor. He said an advisory group would prepare recommendations on how the money should be spent, with an emphasis on equal spending in all areas of the town. The town board would then vote on the recommendations.
Approval of the $30 million plan has raised expectations of community groups that back buying up particular parcels.
"It certainly enhances the possibility there will be money for the Underhill property," said Joseph H. Lorintz, a lawyer from Jericho and the president of the Society to Preserve Underhill. He referred to an 81-acre parcel in a special groundwater protection area in Jericho. The owner, the Tilles Investment Company, has been trying to build houses there for years.
In North Hempstead, Jennifer Rimmer, the director of planning for Residents for a More Beautiful Port Washington, said the town's $15 million program, called the Environmental Legacy Fund, could be used to add to publicly owned waterfront. An example, she said, would be town participation in public purchase and razing of an unused building next to the Barbara John Memorial Park on Manhasset Bay in Port Washington.
Mrs. Newburger, the North Hempstead supervisor, said proposed projects would go to an advisory committee whose members were yet to be appointed.
Donald V. Pupke, a lawyer in Westbury who worked for the Oyster Bay proposal, said the overwhelming support for the town programs should set the stage for a county program. "The town votes provided the baseline of public support for preserving open space and showed the public willingness to pay for preservation," Mr. Pupke said. "Even if the county is in a somewhat dire financial situation, people are willing to pay for a quality of life."
But in Suffolk, in a bewildering turn, county officials and environmental groups were at odds over the voters' rejection of a proposal that would have limited borrowing for land and farm purchases under the 0.25 percent sales-tax program, which voters extended last year.
The environmental groups said they believed that the rejection meant that the county could borrow for environmental programs against total revenues expected under the sales-tax program, which begins Dec. 1 and continues through most of 2013. The county estimates those revenues will total about $176 million over the 13-year period.
The proposal was narrowly defeated, 128,580 to 142,318, according to unofficial returns. But only about a third of the Suffolk residents who voted for president also voted on the environmental proposal. Stewart Lowrie, the director of government relations for the Nature Conservancy, said the low vote count showed the proposal was "very difficult for people to interpret."
The counsel to the Suffolk County Legislature, Paul Sabatino, said the vote meant the sales-tax program remained "a 100 percent pay-as-you-go program," with no borrowing permitted against future revenues. Those who thought that defeat of the proposal would allow widened borrowing were "misinformed and dead wrong," he said.
Michael J. Caracciolo, a Republican county legislator from Riverhead, said the proposal would have allowed the county "to borrow up to 25 percent of that program over the next 13 years in a fiscally responsible manner." With its defeat, he said, "we don't have any authority to borrow."
Opponents of the proposal disagreed. Paul Rabinovitch, the executive director of the Nature Conservancy on Long Island, said there was no evidence that borrowing against future revenues was proscribed. The group led a campaign to defeat the proposition, arguing that it would cripple the county program.
"Somehow over the course of our campaigning it became the flip side of that, and the supporters were saying it would give bonding capacity where there wasn't any before."
The resulting confusion and the low vote, he said, made intent unclear. "Suffolk voters always vote for open space preservation," he said. "But I would not hang my hat on this vote as being a clear mandate."

HEADLINE: Call It Silicon Parkway

BYLINE: By GEORGE JAMES 

 BODY:
THERE is the Silicon Valley, the Silicon Alley, the Silicon Beltway. None of them are in New Jersey.
But the fact is that New Jersey, with more scientists per capita than any other state -- with its telecommunications giants, Internet services, research centers, fast-growing biotechnology companies and vast pharmaceutical industry, all sitting in the shadow of the world's financial capital -- has several high-tech corridors amid its mad tangle of highways. 
 So before laughing at the next New Jersey joke, consider:
* Northern New Jersey alone has 3,000 more high-tech firms than the Silicon Valley.
* Thirty of the fastest-growing high-tech companies in the nation are in New Jersey.
* New Jersey ranks fifth among states in the growth of high-tech companies.
"My sense is we should be looked at in the same way as California, Massachussets and North Carolina," said Caren Franzini, executive director of the New Jersey Economic Development Authority. "No one knows it yet, but they will."
Hoping to get the message out, the state plans to kick off a $2 million marketing campaign early next year as part of a $165 million initiative undertaken by Governor Whitman to help attract high-tech companies, start them up and train a work force.
In addition, the state last month awarded a total of $2 million in planning grants to 30 municipalities for the creation of "cyber districts" to lure high-tech businesses -- an effort that the state claims is the first of its kind in the country.
Yet even as the state pushes to become a major player in the high-tech sweepstakes, some problems loom. For instance, the recent upheaval among high-tech stocks, the drying up of venture capital for start-up companies, the demise of many small e-commerce businesses, and waves of reorganizations and layoffs at such giants as AT&T and Lucent have led many to question the wisdom of having the state's economy so dependent on high-tech ventures.
Maxine Ballen, president of the New Jersey Technology Council, a private organization that she founded four years ago to promote the technology community, said, "There are weak spots in the landscape that don't deserve to succeed, a lot of money in dot-com companies that have no more right to be funded than my 5-year-old niece."
Indeed, Joseph J. Seneca, vice president for academic affairs at Rutgers University and is chairman of the New Jersey Council of Economic Advisors, said the shakeout would continue, particularly among start-up companies and dot-coms.
Mr. Seneca put it this way: "With a lot of births, there are a lot of deaths in terms of businesses."
But, he quickly pointed out, there is no turning back now.
"The direction of the New Jersey economy is clear, at least to me," Mr. Seneca said. "The high value-added and information dependent state economy -- this is our future. We can't go back to a past that probably wasn't as good as we thought it was. We need to be major players in high technology, broadly defined."
Within that definition, the reach of New Jersey's high-tech companies is truly broad. Unlike Silicon Valley in California, with its emphasis on information technology, New Jersey does not rely solely on one high-tech industry, officials say. Nor is there any single area like Silicon Valley or the Route 128 Corridor in Boston or Research Triangle Park in North Carolina.
Rather, New Jersey's high-tech industry is more like an octopus, with its tentacles reaching into almost every part of the state. A section of the Garden State Parkway from Exits 102 to 120, for instance, is becoming known as the Silicon Parkway because of the growth of high-tech companies in towns along the route, among them Holmdel, Eatontown and West Long Branch. Other major thoroughfares -- like Route 1 from Trenton to New Brunswick, Interstate 287 from Morristown to Interstate 78 as well as other stretches along I-78 -- could rightly take the name "hi-tech corridor."
And municipalities around the state -- from traditional centers like Princeton to unlikely towns like Neptune, where a major tech park is being built, to cities like Newark that are trying to awaken from the nightmarish era of white flight and shuttered factories -- are attracting high-tech companies to parks that more closely resemble college campuses.
Yet precisely how many high-tech companies are in New Jersey is difficult to say because it depends on just how high-tech is defined.
"Right now there is no common definition at the state and federal level for what a high-tech company is in terms of the way you count companies and jobs," said Alyn L. Ackermann, public relations manager for the New Jersey Commerce and Economic Growth Commission, which is charged with carrying out the governor's mandate.
For one thing, the pharmaceutical industry is not included in the commission's definition. But Prosperity New Jersey, a public-private partnership that will run the state's high-tech marketing campaign, does include it, as does the New Jersey Technology Council.
The notion of high-tech, according to Prosperity New Jersey, also includes electronics and such computer-related activities as the design and development of hardware and software; Internet engineering or Web design and development; biotechnology; telecommunications engineering and services; aerospace; industrial research or testing laboratories; and medical research.
All told, the New Jersey Commerce and Economic Growth Commission says there are 13,415 technologically related companies in the state, including computer-related services that account for 3,330 businesses, or 24.8 percent of the total, with 26,611 employees, and custom computer programming services with 2,581 companies or 19.2 percent and 43,418 employees.
New Jersey ranks fourth among states in the number of high-tech companies and fifth in growth, according to a recent survey by the American Electronics Association, which also excludes pharmaceuticals but takes in computer-related, electronic and communications equipment and services companies. In the association's count, the state has 10,234 high-tech companies, as against top-ranked California, with 28,839, followed by New York with 13,368 and Texas with 12,228.
In terms of the growth of high-tech companies, New Jersey, which gained 2,394 high-tech companies from 1996 to 1998, trails California, Texas, New York and Florida.
Brad McDearman, president of McDearman Associates, an economic development consulting company in Baltimore, which researched statistics for Prosperity New Jersey, said that based on the Deloitte & Touche 1999 Technology Fast 500, New Jersey has 30 of the fastest-growing high tech companies in the nation, putting it sixth behind California with 104, Massachusetts with 53, Virginia with 41, Maryland with 35, and New York with 31.
When translating these numbers into people, this picture of New Jersey begins emerges:
* The New Jersey Commerce and Economic Growth Commission says the state's high-tech companies employ one in 10 workers in the private sector.
* The state has a work force of 184,000 scientists, engineers and technicians -- making it first in scientists per capita, according to Mr. McDearman and the New Jersey Technology Center.
* Employees in the state's high-tech industries are among the nation's best paid, with an average annual salary of $68,700, according to the American Electronics Association; the annual average wage is $39,516.
Put yet another way, New Jersey ranks first in the the manufacture of pharmaceutical products, first in spending on electronics research and first in electronics innovations, according to PSE&G Industry Profiles. For instance, nearly 40 percent of all new drugs approved by the Federal Drug Administration come from New Jersey companies.
And, based on information from the American Electronics Association and Nasdaq, New Jersey ranks fourth in total financing for research and development, with more than $12 billion spent annually.
"If you compare New Jersey to other top states, they are much larger," said Mr. McDearman. "New Jersey is not larger than the metropolitan Phoenix area in terms of land, but its numbers in terms of high-tech establishments are quite impressive, and that's not including pharmaceuticals."
"Based on our studies," Mr. McDearman added, "by a lot of high-tech measures, New Jersey has a lot of pieces of the puzzle that other states are looking for and need, and all in a very small area."
And scattered throughout the state, or as Mr. McDearman put it, in this "very small area," are yet smaller tracts, like the 195-acre complex in the Murray Hill section of Berkeley Heights along the I-78 corridor.
Indeed, it is probably one of the more famous high-tech campuses in the world. A modern building with a six-story pyramid front and an oxidized copper roof rises from the brilliant green landscape at the end of a long driveway in a cluster of eight buildings.
Some of the buildings are interconnected, creating what seem to be miles and miles of narrow corridors. And behind the doors on either side are rooms that look like sets for science-fiction movies, where scientists gleefully experiment with lasers and holographs and tubes of glass that turn into optic fiber no thicker than a human hair.
This is the former Bell Labs -- birthplace of the transistor, the laser and the communications satellite -- which is now the headquarters of Lucent Technologies, the largest telecommunications equipment company in the world.
Behind one of those doors, two members of the technical staff, Lisa Dhar and William L. Wilson, are bathed in the glow of a green laser they are using to create a high-density holographic data storage system.
In another room off the labyrinth of corridors, Man F. Yan, the technical manager in the optical fiber research department, and Patrick Wisk, an engineer, are using a high-intensity flame on glass rods to create new kinds of optical fiber.
Dr. Dhar, 32, came to Bell Labs after getting her doctorate in physical chemistry at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Dr. Wilson, 41, arrived here after receiving his doctorate in chemical physics from Stanford.
Dr. Yan, 52, who grew up in Hong Kong, came to Bell Labs after getting his doctorate in 1976 at M.I.T; Mr. Wisk, 39, who received a master's degree in material science from Rutgers. has been here 15 years.
What drew them to the area -- and keeps them -- is the creative environment of Bell Labs itself. "I think Bell Labs is unique in that it has a very dynamic research environment," Dr. Dhar says. "Just the mix of people that Bell Labs puts together is one of the most compelling features."
Saying that he is "a science junkie" with a "gym rat mentality," Dr. Wilson adds: "Everyone here to some extent is a frustrated university professor. So if you want to learn about something, you can wander down to somebody's office and harass them about it, and they'll teach you everything you need to know."
Mr. Wisk puts it this way: "I've worked on probably about seven different projects before I did fiber. I was working on lasers before, semiconductors and different kinds of things, so it's always been something new."
Except for Mr. Wisk, who is a native New Jerseyan, the notion of coming to the state did not initially appeal to them. "To be honest, they do not have a very good reputation," said Dr. Yan. "Most people just know about New Jersey by the turnpike."
But now that they are here, the quality of life in the state is one factor that makes them want to stay -- the seashore, the diversity of the towns, the proximity to New York. New Jersey's treasure, its quality of life, is an element that officials of high-tech companies say plays a large role in attracting industry and employees.
Compaq Financial Services Corporation is an example of a company that came to New Jersey partly because of the quality of life here as well as the economics and the presence of a skilled labor market.
In January 1997, the Compaq Computer Corporation of Houston started up Compaq Financial to provide financing plans for users of its equipment.
Irving M. Rothman, a former executive of AT&T Capital Corporation who became president and chief executive of the new company, wanted the headquarters to be close to the New York financial markets. And Mr. Rothman, who was born in Bayonne, felt New Jersey would be the cheapest and most convenient location for the operation, so he sublet a building in Woodbridge.
In choosing a headquarters, a prerequisite was proximity to Newark International Airport, he said. The company ended up in a sleek black-and-silver four-story building on the site of a former Bell Labs structure in the Murray Hill section near Lucent.
"We did a ZIP code analysis where our employees were living," Mr. Rothman said, "And believe it or not, the epicenter was the Millburn-Short Hills area. So this is as close as we could get to the epicenter."
When about 375 of the company's 750 employees moved into the building in May, they were greeted by town officials, an example of how some communities are taking an extra step to attract high-tech companies.
"We try to do home-style welcoming," said David Cohen, the mayor of Berkeley Heights, a rustic community in the contours of the Watchung Mountains that also has attracted Microsoft and Novell. "We have a ribbon cutting. I'll give tours of the town to company officials. By and large, we've had a positive reaction."
Still, one reason that entrepreneurial tech companies did not spring up in New Jersey as they did in Silicon Valley in California is because of what James Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers, calls "the golden womb."
Simply put, people were secure in companies like Bell Labs and never wanted to leave.
"It was like being at a university with full funding," Dean Hughes said. "They didn't have the driving need to go out and create their own firms and develop their own products."
But that began changing about five years ago.
"Quite frankly what's causing the growth in the number of start-ups are the people willing to leave the mother ship of Lucent and AT&T and start their own businesses," said Jeff Matros, president and chief executive of Tachion Networks, a highly successful telecommunications equipment company.
Tachion, which was founded by several scientists from Bell Labs it in 1996, is a case in point.
"They were struggling in a basement looking for capital," said Mr. Matros, a former executive at Siemens and IBM who was working for a venture capital company in Silicon Valley at the time.
When Mr. Matros joined the company in May 1999, there were 10 people working in an 8,000-square-foot building in Eatontown. Today, the company employs 225 people who are working in a new 75,000-square-foot building in West Long Branch.
While most companies are concerned about losing experienced people to start-up ventures, Lucent has taken a somewhat different approach. In 1997 it created the New Ventures Group to finance start-up companies that are based on Bell Labs technology but do not necessarily fit into Lucent's business strategies.
In turn, Lucent retains various degrees of ownership, although the scientists do not work for Lucent but receive equity in the start-up.
"Actually, we have 26 that are now active," said Thomas M. Uhlman, president of New Ventures. "Once we start them, we syndicate them with venture capital investors. And many of them find their homes and ongoing existence in New Jersey."
And he added, "I think they are contributing to its exciting start-up technology growth environment."
For now, no one predict with any certainty just how the high-tech -- and more specifically, the dot-com explosion -- will shake out in New Jersey.
Milton Leontiades, dean of the business school at Rutgers University in Camden, predicted that as northern and central New Jersey becomes more densely populated, the new high-tech frontier will shift to South Jersey, where even now "a number of emerging tech companies are bubbling below the surface."
But, Dean Leontiades said, the success of the Microsofts create anticipation of growth without anticipation of a downside.
"There are growth phases and flat phases and even down phases," he said. "You can't build future plans on the past repeating itself."

Plenty of Movement to Get Nowhere

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
The stock market bounced around last week but thanks to a hefty gain on Tuesday, when the Nasdaq composite posted its 10th-biggest advance on record, the major indexes wound up about where they started. The stalemated presidential election dampened spirits, as did several corporate earning warnings. Federal Reserve policy makers did little to encourage investors looking for an interest-rate cut.
 "We are being overwhelmed by a lot of reactive trading" to news headlines, said Brian Belski, a strategist at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray. The Nasdaq gained 5.78 percent on Tuesday, lost 4.22 percent on Thursday and finished at 3,027.21. A week earlier, the close was 3,028.99. 
 The Dow Jones industrials and the Standard & Poor's 500 both eked out negligible gains, ending at 10,629.87 and 1,367.72, respectively.
 One depressant was a downgrade by Merrill Lynch of five makers of computer chips for communications. And on Friday, BellSouth skidded $7.13, to $42.13, after the phone company said its profit growth next year might be only half previous estimates.
 Benefiting in part from election nervousness, the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond rose enough for the week to cut its yield to 5.69 percent from 5.75 percent. ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

HEADLINE: This Campus Is Being Simulated

BYLINE: By James Traub; James Traub is a contributing writer for the magazine. He last wrote about Newt Gingrich.

 BODY:
Two years ago, a few days before Thanksgiving, Mark Taylor, a faculty member at Williams College, in northwestern Massachusetts, received a phone call from Herbert Allen Jr. Taylor is a professor of humanities, a designation Williams invented for him; his sphere of expertise encompasses religion, philosophy, architecture theory and a couple of other disciplines. Allen is the investment banker and plutocrat famous for the retreat of bankers and plutocrats he hosts each summer in Sun Valley, Idaho. Both men had been members of the Williams community for a quarter-century or so -- Allen is a prominent alumnus and donor -- and they have houses about a mile apart in the thickly forested Berkshire hills in which the college is nestled, but they had never met; nor was it easy to imagine that they would have anything to say to each other. Taylor was one of those protean figures who vex campus life -- a perverse and provocative thinker, a guru and a troublemaker. He was flirting with an attractive offer from the University of North Carolina, and a former Williams administrator had recruited Allen to see if he could do something about it. Allen invited Taylor over for coffee.
As Taylor recalls it, Allen, a figure for whom "bottom line" is not a figure of speech, said, "What are you doing, what aren't you doing that you'd like to be doing and where is the world heading?" Taylor talked, as is his wont, about Hegel and Kierkegaard and Marx, about religion and philosophy and art and economics. He argued that, thanks largely to the Internet, a new "network society" was emerging in which knowledge would be the most precious of resources, that institutions and individuals would be drawn together in a global information marketplace and that the walls that separated the university from the larger world would be pierced. "Usually, when I would describe to people where I think the world is heading," Taylor told me recently, "the answer would be, 'Not in your lifetime or mine.' "And Allen, in any case, says that he was the kind of college student who would have skipped the sort of classes Mark Taylor teaches. But while Allen had no use for Kierkegaard, he understood marketplaces, and he believed in the transformative powers of the Internet. He said, "The world you're describing is the world I live in." And so, as one of Taylor's Williams colleagues puts it, "he put his money where Mark's mouth is." He invited Taylor to draw up a plan to join the network society. 
 Now, many months of Taylor's blue-skying and many millions of Herbert Allen's dollars later, the fruit of that conversation is about to become available for public consumption. Beginning in February, the Global Education Network, a private, for-profit company owned by Allen, will be selling four or five college courses over the Internet. (The company plans to offer 25 courses by next September.) For now, these courses are being aimed principally at the "lifelong learner" market, but both Allen and Taylor talk about ultimately transforming higher education itself. Mary Lefkowitz, a classics scholar at Wellesley, will be offering her class on Greek mythology; professors at Brown, Duke, Williams and other colleges and universities will be teaching courses on Bocaccio's "Decameron," on Alexander the Great, on the literature of Barcelona, on AIDS and on biology. Allen and other investors have already committed $20 million to the project and is likely to run through many more millions within a few years.
You'd probably have to go back to space travel to find an innovation that has abetted millennial fantasies as much as the Internet has; we live in an age of technological utopianism. Nevertheless, it's perfectly possible that if GEN doesn't bring about the revolution its founders have in mind, one or more of its competitors will. Online learning is already a $2 billion business; Gerald Odening, an analyst with Chase Bank, predicts that the figure will rise by 35 percent a year, reaching $9 billion by 2005. There are already online law schools and business schools and Ph.D. programs, as well as thousands of individual courses.
Online education has the force of inevitability. But is it good? It would, of course, be a fine thing if thousands of people could take Mary Lefkowitz's course on mythology; and perhaps it would also be a fine thing if classics departments started making enough money that they could afford to keep teaching classes that only six people care about, as Mark Taylor believes they will. But what about those walls, which among other things provide a little bit of protection from the all-devouring marketplace? As Charles Nesson, a professor at Harvard Law School who has given a lot of thought to the Internet, asks: "What happens if you convert the university into a production house for making knowledge products? The university starts to look less like a community of scholars and much more like a drug company that has work-for-hire knowledge workers producing proprietary research." Who will bother to come to the university's defense once it starts behaving like every other institution in the culture? The Internet constitutes a much more profound challenge to the university than do, say, rising tuition costs or affirmative-action programs or speech codes -- because its promise and its threat are one and the same.
Remember college? you were away from home, you discovered all sorts of people just like you and not just like you, you stayed up all night with people of the same and opposite sex, you read great books and pondered great questions, you made terrible mistakes that turned out not to be fatal -- you lived. And if you were lucky enough to go to a school something like Williams College, then you lived in an enclosed garden, a place set apart from the world for which you were being theoretically prepared. What you learned best, you learned almost unconsciously, from immersion in this world devoted to books and ideas. The notion that the Internet can in some sense supplant this world seems ludicrous -- as if in the future we'll be eating dinner by Internet. But to think this way is to misunderstand the nature of higher education in the United States.
There are 15.6 million Americans in college; an insignificant fraction of them go to schools like Williams. Nearly eight million students attend a community college, which generally means they are living at home. Even among four-year institutions, very few are genuinely selective, and very few pay much more than lip service to those Great Books; with a college degree becoming an indispensable passport to middle-class life, both the colleges and the students take an increasingly utilitarian view of the transaction that results in a degree. Higher education is a $228 billion enterprise; private, for-profit colleges like the University of Phoenix or DeVry Institute are gaining increasing legitimacy. One of the fastest growing segments of the marketplace consists of institutions like Motorola University; Gerald Odening of Chase predicts that the number of "corporate universities" will rocket from 480 to 1,600 over the next few years, and adds that many of them will be offering accredited courses toward an undergraduate degree or a technical certificate. The distinction between the proprietary and the nonprofit, and between education and training, is blurring. Almost all colleges, and not just the private ones, now see themselves in overtly competitive terms. Schools market; students shop.
The Internet is perfectly suited to this overtly utilitarian and swiftly expanding world. The authors of "Dancing With the Devil: Information Technology and the New Competition in Higher Education," a book of essays published last year, argue that the university as currently constituted can not satisfy the exploding demand for learning; it is not "scalable." The Internet is. One professor can address thousands of students, and can do so either simultaneously or "asynchronously." The Internet allows adults who need to be at home to go to school in their living rooms; it renders the bricks-and-mortar facilities that make college so expensive virtually irrelevant. And because the Internet permits interactivity, it can function as a simulacrum of a classroom. James Duderstadt, the former president of the University of Michigan, suggests in "Dancing With the Devil" that the time may not be far off when a small number of academic celebrities, a larger number of "content providers" and a still larger number of "learning facilitators" create and administer "learningware products" for "an array of for-profit service companies" who in turn sell these products to students. "Quite a contrast with the current enterprise!" Duderstadt writes cheerily.
What will it be like to go to college in cyberspace? Last month, I went to Allen & Company's offices on Fifth Avenue to attend a simulation of a Global Education Network class. "Attend," of course, is a misleading word. I sat in a wood-paneled conference room with Alexander Parker, GEN's head of curriculum development, and a laptop. Since GEN has not yet put its courses on the Internet, the class I took, an introductory biology course for nonmajors, was on a CD-ROM. Parker clicked me through to the second lecture, on the discovery of DNA. The 55-minute presentation was divided into fourteen "modules," including "Overview of DNA Structure," "Watson and Crick," "X-Ray Crystallography" and "Nature of a Polynucleotide." I clicked on "Overview," and the teacher, Kenneth Miller, a professor at Brown, appeared in the upper-left-hand corner. A screen at his right served as an electronic blackboard. When he read an excerpt from a letter by the biologist Oswald Avery, the words of the letter appeared on the screen along with a picture of Avery, the way they would on a newscast. When Miller explained the structure of a nucleotide, he put a molecular diagram on the screen. He might have put the same diagram on an overhead projector in class, but here he could manipulate the image, highlighting various parts and moving them around to show how one nucleotide docks with another.
The class was in some ways better, and in some ways worse, than a conventional lecture. On the one hand, whenever my attention had wandered I could hit the pause button and click back. On the other hand, Miller himself was a rather sketchy presence, and when at one point he turned to the blackboard, you could hear the squeak of the chalk but you couldn't make out a word he had written. The visual aids, at this early stage, are limited to still pictures and dancing molecules; anything much more complex would strain the available bandwidth. Parker's own view is that "it's not as rich an experience as a 15-person seminar, but it is somewhat richer than a 500-person lecture."
What I had not experienced, of course, was interactivity, which is the feature that makes the Internet radically different from prior distance learning media, whether the television or the mail. Each GEN class will include teaching assistants -- learning facilitators, in Duderstadt's not-quite-human phraseology -- drawn from the vast pool of unemployed and underemployed graduate students and bearers of graduate degrees. GEN is calculating that it will need no more than one assistant for every 30 students, if that. Once the system is up and running, students will be assigned to the equivalent of chat rooms for "threaded conversations" with fellow students and teaching assistants, and they will be able to ask questions about the material. Students who give a wrong answer on a test will be automatically directed back to the portion of the text that supplies the answer. This is still a fairly primitive use of the technology; once GEN has learned where students go wrong, it plans to videotape the professor offering a series of alternate explanations of the same material, so that a student can be directed along any one of several different pathways to help him or her grasp what wasn't clear the first time around. Another possibility inherent in this multiple-pathways approach is to offer students different ways of demonstrating competence. A student can explain the chemical structure of nucleotides directly, or, Parker says, "We can give him a bucket of elements and say, 'Here, build a nucleotide.' "
And who knows what else? The capacities of the medium have only begun to be explored. A few years from now, Herb Allen says, "You're going to be playing this stuff on your thumbnail, on the back of your eyelid, on your glasses." Maybe you'll be sitting in your living room with helmet and goggles -here" and "there" at the same time. Whether this is a brave new world to which we ought to aspire is, of course, another question altogether.
While it has become a truism that the internet will revolutionize higher education, there is some confusion as to exactly whose experience is likely to be transformed. GEN expects to do about 90 percent of its business with adult learners, who would be taking noncredit classes, and the remaining 10 percent with high school students, who would, or so the theory goes, receive Advanced Placement credit for a GEN class. Only somewhere down the road would GEN be colonizing the campus itself. At least in the immediate future, the elite institutions will function principally as producers, rather than consumers, in the online marketplace.
But that's not to say that students at these institutions will be confined to the traditional technologies of lecture and blackboard. Academics on campuses across the country are experimenting with the Internet as a pedagogic tool. Edward Burger, a professor of mathematics at Williams, has created a series of lectures on algebra and calculus that look very much like a GEN course. Burger realized that if his students could learn the basic concepts and do required exercises back in their dorms, then once they came to class they could work problems together at the blackboard rather than sit silently, hunched over their notes. Burger's motivation was to bring spontaneity and life to the classroom. "I just want to teach in the most powerful way I can," he says. "If it's technology, that's great. If it's a crayon, that's great, too." Elite undergraduate education will probably be the last bastion to fall to the online providers. But the Internet has already made major inroads in alumni education, extension schools and ongoing-training programs for doctors, lawyers and others. Much of the really serious action right now is in professional education, where instruction tends to be directed to the mastery of discrete skills, and where the students' own utilitarian ambitions make them willing to do without with the physical community of like-minded souls. Kaplan Inc., the College Boards preparation company, has established Concord Law School, an online institution that currently has 500 students across the country enrolled in a four-year J.D. degree program. The American Bar Association does not accredit distance-learning schools, and no less an authority than Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has criticized Concord for trying to offer legal education without face-to-face interaction. But the school has been a boon for older students who are fully employed or must stay at home and who are pleased to pay $20,000 rather three or four times that much for a law degree. Perhaps they also appreciate the modest workload, since Concord's application form asks students, "Are you willing to devote 2.5 hours a day to achieve your goals?"
The most intriguing, and easily the most sophisticated, of the ventures offering online professional education is UNext.com. The company was founded by Andrew Rosenfield, a lawyer and legal consultant, and Gary Becker, a Nobel Prize-winning economist at the University of Chicago, who hit on the idea of selling online business courses to big companies eager to improve their employees' skills. They understood that in order to market courseware to top firms, they would need both the academic expertise and the brand name of the elite business schools. They offered a deal worth at least $20 million to founding institutions; and in short order they had signed up Columbia, Chicago, Stanford and Carnegie-Mellon Universities, as well as the London School of Economics.
With this seal of academic approval in hand, UNext reached agreements to market courses to AOL-Time Warner, Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Barclays Bank and others. UNext has had courses up on the Net since August; students can take either full-length courses or minicourses that focus on specific skill areas. Like GEN, UNext is targeting the adult learner, but students can also accumulate credit toward a diploma from the company's own business school, Cardean University. Rosenfield says that UNext is in varying stages of negotiation to offer courses in Brazil, China, India and elsewhere. Rosenfield, unlike Mark Taylor, wants to make money, not rock boats. "We have no ambition to substitute for physical colleges," he says. "We think they're first best. But for many people and many places, that's just not going to occur."
Ultimately, the online revolution will make us think differently about the nature of the university. The university as we know it now does many things: it creates courses and organizes them into a curriculum, provides a physical setting for instruction and implements a technology of instruction -- teachers in a classroom. What if we break these apart? You'll still leave Mom and Dad behind for four years at Gopher Junction College, but rather than listen to the duds on Gopher's faculty, you'll troll the Internet for courses; or maybe Gopher will furnish the Cornell science curriculum, or the GEN European History curriculum, with the school's own faculty serving as "learning facilitators." Or maybe you'll stay at home and find a college to serve as your formal credentialing body. Entire subjects may be automated. In a recent issue of The Futurist, a professor named Samuel L. Dunn pointed out that only 25 courses account for 50 percent of total credit enrollment in American colleges, and he predicted that "there will be 'killer applications' for these 25 courses available by 2010." A villa in Provence to the professor who comes up with the killer app for Psych 101.
"Mark loves overboard," Shawn Rosenheim, a professor of English at Williams, says of his colleague Mark Taylor. The distinguishing feature of Taylor's career is a fearless, or perhaps reckless, orientation to the new and to whatever challenges orthodoxy. He calls himself a philosopher of culture, but such is his restlessness that it's not easy to say what Taylor is a scholar of; he has done influential work on Hegel and Kierkegaard, on post-death-of-God theology, on architecture theory and the postmodern aesthetic. In the 80's, Taylor became one of the leading exponents in this country of the work of Jacques Derrida, the French philosopher who popularized the term "deconstruction" and whose work is widely taken as some sort of elaborate joke inside most American philosophy departments, including the one at Williams. Taylor no longer describes himself as a Derridean, but you can still read Derrida's influence in Taylor's love of the ambiguous and the incongruous and his scorn for the idea that philosophy can proceed from universally accepted axioms. Taylor's work is playful, perverse, rarefied, ingenious and often brilliant. He is fascinated by surfaces, and he rejects the distinction between surface and depth. "Hides hide hide," as he writes puckishly in a 1997 book titled "Hiding," which includes a chapter on fashion that is interrupted by what purport to be articles from fashion magazines, though in fact they are sendups created by our artful author.
Taylor's experimental bent led him to work with emerging technology. In 1992 he used teleconferencing to teach a "global seminar" with a colleague in Helsinki. The two published their e-mails as a book titled "Imagologies: Media Philosophy." For a class on Las Vegas, which Taylor saw as the node of American popular culture, he developed a video game on CD-ROM, complete with glittery jewel box; using a video representation of a slot machine, students explored Las Vegas as a prism for understanding virtual culture.
Taylor was interested in anything that moved away from or subverted the linearity and abstractness of the conventional classroom. In the mid-90's the Internet, and the idea of a network society, became increasingly central to his work. He developed a media lab in which students in one of his classes prepared multimedia hypertexts, and he taught an Internet class for Williams alumni. In 1995, Taylor established the Center for Arts and the Humanities on the Williams campus in order to explore the new technology.
At the same time, Taylor was feeling more and more frustrated at Williams, where he felt hemmed in by academic convention. "None of these things were ever picked up by the institution," Taylor says. In 1998, the University of North Carolina offered Taylor a new technology center of his own. Enter Herb Allen.
It isn't the technology part of the story, but the Herb Allen part, that people who know Mark Taylor or his work find stupefying. Allen, a second-generation Wall Street titan, a secretive figure who has earned a fortune making investments and brokering deals, is a veritable J. P. Morgan of our day. Taylor is a child of '68, a radical who sees through all structures of power, very much including capitalism. How could they make common cause? What could one infer about the new world that was arriving from the fact that they had made common cause?
I visited Taylor not long ago in the hope of gaining some insight into this odd convergence. Taylor lives in a modern house perched at the very edge of the mountains, though he works in a converted barn in his backyard. He had a work in progress sitting on a table in the studio: two boxes filled with little silver canisters labeled "Pound" or "Kandinsky" or "Balzac." Inside each canister was a thimbleful of dirt or grass taken from a great man's grave. Taylor is collaborating with a photographer who has gone all over the world documenting the grave sites of the 150 most important artists and intellectuals of the modern era -- Taylor's private Valhalla, an intellectual's reliquary with a hint of kitsch. It was an art project designed to explore his favorite themes. "It's kind of the flip side of this whole cyber thing," Taylor explained. "Our obsession with the palpable, with remains." We yearn for the actual as life becomes more virtual.
Taylor looks like a bit more like a croupier than an icon-smashing thinker. He is trim and wiry and has a close-cropped mustache, and his silver-gray hair runs straight back from a widow's peak in a splendid, glossy mane. He does not, however, talk like a croupier. There is a distinctly postmodern element of collage to Taylor's conversation, which is peppered with improbable juxtapositions and words that whirl around one another in patterns of likeness -- figure, disfigure, figuration. He riffs, and these dizzying monologues can often be recognized, when they finally hit home, as digressive spirals. I asked a question, and Taylor began talking about Hegel and Kierkegaard and Derrida and Mahayana Buddhism, and he told me that when he had met President Clinton on Martha's Vineyard this past summer, he said, "I'm probably the only person who has spent the last 30 years thinking about what the meaning of 'is' is." (Hillary laughed; Bill blinked.)
I had no idea where Taylor was going until he finally got to his point, which was that the radically undermining impulse of deconstruction had become, over time, a cliche. "The only word the critics know," he said, "is 'no.' "His own friends had reached the centers of power, and their identity politics, their critique of the canon, had become the new dogma. And so Taylor was in revolt against revolt.
There was disillusionment, or boredom, with the old and its dubious claims of purity, but also an ardent wish to be part of the new. "Insofar as you want to engage in practice responsibly," Taylor said, "you have to play with the hand you're dealt. And the hand we're dealt seems to me to be one in which the market has certainly won out over other kinds of systems."
Taylor said he started to become fascinated by markets after the 1987 crash; there must, he felt, be some connection between the postmodern moment and postindustrial capitalism. This new capitalism was intellectually interesting and culturally powerful in a way that industrial capitalism was not. The new technology was not about stamping out products but transmitting ideas and information. The metaphor of the assembly line, and even of the electric-power grid, was giving way to the Internet metaphor of the network -- of connectivity and instantaneousness. The mechanical was surrendering to the claims of the organic. You could understand financial markets by applying the biological theory of complex adaptive systems. The old polarities just didn't hold any more. "On the one hand," Taylor says, "avant-garde art is supposed to resist all that kind of market stuff; on the other hand, the ideological underpinnings of 'make it new' " -- the battle-cry of the avant-garde -- is precisely what capitalism means."
It's no coincidence that Thomas Krens, the globe-spanning director of the Guggenheim, is one of Taylor's great friends, or that Taylor is intrigued by Rem Koolhaas, the postmodern architect who now designs Prada showrooms.
Taylor loved Williams, where he had been on the faculty since 1973, and he loved teaching -- in 1995 he won the Carnegie Foundation's award as professor of the year. But he also believed that the world of higher education was locked in a posture of reaction to these emerging forces. Taylor recognized that the Internet posed a threat to some things that were sacred, but he was convinced that it also held out immense promise -- not only to break through ancient ideas about teaching and learning, but also to reduce the staggering cost of a college education and to help universities continue to engage in such market-indifferent acts as teaching Hegel to eight students. "Education is the oil of the 21st century," Taylor says in his prophetic mode. "We're sitting on the reserves. The question is, 'How can we capitalize on those reserves in a way that on the one hand remains loyal to the principles of academic integrity and on the other hand is profitable?' "
And so Herb Allen placed his phone call at a moment when large forces were converging: the exhaustion of an antimarket ideology, the growing appeal of the marketplace itself, the rise of a transforming technology, the push of new demands on the university. His little coffee with Mark Taylor marked one of those unnoticed moments on which cultural history can pivot.
Unlike unext, which was created for the straightforward purpose of making money, Global Education Network was brought into being essentially to vindicate Mark Taylor and Herb Allen's conception of the world and their shared critique of the academy. Perhaps for that reason, it has a rather high degree of difficulty as a business proposition. Neither Taylor nor Allen were ever interested in marketing high-grade skills, as UNext does. GEN offers full-length classes, with homework and papers and tests, and if offers them in the core undergraduate subjects.
Still, like their counterparts at UNext, Taylor and Allen understood that they would have to trade on the prestige of the great academic brand names. The trick was to sign affiliation agreements that would guarantee access to leading scholars. Earlier this year, armed with a rather crude prototype, company officials began making the rounds of the nation's leading colleges and universities, including Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford, Amherst, Swarthmore and, of course, Williams. In most cases, they spoke to the president and provost and a few faculty members. They talked about the Internet's pedagogic potential, about democratizing higher education, about exploring a powerful new medium that was driving the culture. And they offered a deal that sounded hard to refuse: GEN would bear all the development costs while the institution would get a piece of the company and a fraction of the gross receipts. All they had to do was let their professors go.
GEN was enthusiastically received in some quarters. Peter Lange, the provost at Duke, said that he had been impressed both with the material and with the message, which he summarized as, "We're seeking to provide distance learning courses in a format and of a quality that will map well onto what you as a top-tier educational institution are doing." But on the very highest peaks of the university world, the GEN officials were essentially treated like ambassadors from a barbarous nation. One prominent university president lectured Taylor and Allen about the dangers of "contamination." Herb Allen sums up the general reaction by saying, "We didn't encounter hostility; we encountered intransigence."
While Brown, Wellesley and Duke agreed to sign up with GEN, the company was rebuffed everywhere else. This was a setback, if not quite a catastrophe. Save at the three affiliated schools, the company now negotiates with individual professors, though it is by no means clear that the leading universities will simply stand by while GEN strikes deals with their academic stars.
One of the schools that turned GEN down, interesting enough, was Williams. When I arrived on campus early in the fall semester, it was a warm and breezy day, and students in shorts and T-shirts were playing Frisbee on the broad, perfectly trimmed lawns or practicing lacrosse against a dormitory wall. Williams is a paradisal spot. Hawthorne lived nearby, and Melville stared out the window at the shaggy mass of Mount Greylock as he conjured up the looming form of Moby-Dick.
The campus has ancient trees and old stone buildings and new science labs and one street of extremely modest stores. Mark Taylor has a theory that Williams is the model for Athena College, the bucolic and smugly progressive site of Philip Roth's most recent novel, "The Human Stain." Williams is, at the very least, archetypally related to Roth's invention -- intellectually serious, self-enclosed and self-regarding, at once forward-looking and deeply conservative. It must be one of the very few colleges where professors receive a burial plot as a perquisite of tenure. A place like Williams is plainly and even self-consciously an archaism in the modern world. Should we wish it otherwise?
Mark Taylor is, of course, unambiguous on this score. Herb Allen has introduced Taylor to capitalism, and he has embraced its spirit with something of the hyperbolic fervor of the escapee from behind the Iron Curtain. "Three of the fundamental differences between Herb's world and mine," Taylor says, "are speed, risk and competition. Herb's world moves at warp speed; if you're not where there's risk, you're not where you're supposed to be; and competition is brutal. The university world moves glacially; it's risk averse; and once you've got tenure, there's no competition. How you can act creatively and productively in this world when you have that kind of inertia and resistance, I don't know." For Taylor, the Internet, and the idea of the network society, will mean change for the academy on every level. "What would it be like to create an educational institution that looked more like Nasdaq than a Ford assembly line?" he asks.
And he knows the answer: no more tenure, no more endless layers of bureaucracy, no more traditional curriculum. Taylor imagines a curriculum "structured like a hypertext," based on interconnections rather than discrete domains. And he imagines a new pedagogy suited to new students and a new medium. "Faculty often convince themselves of the specialness and nontranslatability of what they do," he says. "A lot of it comes back to what Derrida identified as the metaphysics of presence: what is really valuable about what we do is the gemtlichkeit of face-to-face. And what they resist is mediation. We're not doing the same thing; it's different. Is it as good as? In some ways, yes, in other ways, no. It's different, but there's a value to that kind of difference."
The members of the committee that the Williams administration appointed to study the merits of GEN's proposal did not feel, at least on the surface, that they had to decide on the relative merits of Herb Allen's world and theirs. They rejected GEN's proposal because they didn't think it would do what it purported to do. The head of the Wharton School's online-learning program had explained to the committee that courses were immensely expensive to produce; Wharton had lost money on its program every year. A study by the University of Illinois argued that the economies of scale characteristic of e-commerce don't operate in the case of online learning, since you have to keep adding teaching assistants as the student population grows. And even this was assuming a vast audience. In its final report, the committee wrote, "The frequently imagined audience for 'hundreds of thousands' of students waiting to enroll in such courses, however, simply does not exist." Sherron Knopp, an English professor, says: "People think because it's the Internet it's Rumpelstiltskin and you can turn straw into gold. We weren't convinced there was any gold there."
But given that GEN itself was taking all the financial risk -- if the numbers didn't work out, only the company would be harmed -- it seems clear that Taylor and Allen provoked a sense of unease that went far deeper than mere pragmatic calculations. Precisely because GEN was aimed at the very heart of the undergraduate experience, it raised questions about the nature of the university that other Internet companies, seeking to occupy a more peripheral spot in the academy, did not. In essence, the GEN proposal was taken as a kind of inadvertent referendum on Williams-ness.
Shawn Rosenheim, something of a Mark Taylor disciple and probably the most experimentally inclined figure on the Williams committee, says that he was "shocked and disheartened" to see how his colleagues stiffened before the prospect of the new. "The academy has become so deeply mandarin," says Rosenheim. "It's really a creature of sub-sub-specialties. Something like GEN would have the potential of requiring our work to be more public, to be accountable in certain ways." That was not, Rosenheim concedes, a widely shared perspective. "The amount of nonsense I heard about Williams teaching was unbelievable," he says. "As if those students who show up at the 8:30 class are there strictly for the love of knowledge."
Still, the committee did not object to online learning itself. While opposing an institutional alliance with GEN, the majority of the committee enthusiastically supported the use of "electronic textbooks," a category that includes the Internet lectures that Edward Burger, the math professor, pioneered. The only real difference between Burger's material and GEN's is the way they are used. The electronic textbook does not challenge the metaphysics of presence, and that distinction is crucial for those faculty members who do not share Taylor's wish to break free from the confines of the institution. "Our icon," says Steven Gerrard, a professor of philosophy, "is Mark Hopkins on a log" -- a reference to James Garfield's famous comment about Mark Hopkins, then president of Williams, that "a university is a student on one end of a pine log and Mark Hopkins on the other."
Gerrard is Mark Taylor's countertype -- a mild, reasonable, bookish soul whose office features a chess set, not a pile of canisters full of dirt from dead thinkers. He regards postmodernism as "a fad." And he feels the same way about Taylor's view of the marketplace as a source of creativity. At a meeting with GEN, Gerrard recalls: "They were holding out to Williams, 'We're going to make you rich.' That's really troubling. I don't think the marketplace of money is a good metaphor for the marketplace of ideas." Fortunately, Gerrard says, an institution with an endowment of $1.5 billion and a student body of only 2,000 can afford to be more or less immune to such blandishments -- though some of the other faculty members were not at all averse to profit-making activities. Gerrard himself has few doubts about the university's detachment from the marketplace. When I recited to him Taylor's catechism about "Herb's world" and "Mark's world," he said, "If that's Herb's world, I think it's my job and the faculty's job to resist that world and to fight against it."
But can you? The university has been able to hang on to its posture of unworldliness because its core functions have had very little economic value beyond its walls. What happens when even philosophy and English literature become marketable commodities? What will become of the cozy world of Mark Hopkins on a log?
Suddenly the academic can become a free agent. GEN is already working with three professors at Williams and is now negotiating deals with other faculty members there and elsewhere. Competition among the elite universities has already created an unprecedented star system; think how much more supercharged the atmosphere will become when stars can not only play the universities against one another but also the academic world itself against the online marketplace. How does the elite institution keep its most prized members happy without sacrificing the sense of community that distinguishes a university from a publishing house?
The issue has already been joined. Last year, Arthur Miller, the Harvard Law School professor known to the public through appearances on PBS, provoked an uproar when he agreed to teach a course at Concord Law School. Miller was rebuked by his dean, and Harvard issued an updated version of its guidelines explicitly stating that faculty should "not be deflected from their primary commitment to educate Harvard students by assuming competing obligations to teach for other institutions" -- including online ones. Miller has been muttering furiously about intellectual property rights since then, asking whether there is any meaningful difference between the videotapes he markets as students' aids and the essentially identical videotapes that Concord markets as a "course."
Even colleagues of Miller's who think a person of his intelligence should have no trouble recognizing the distinction -- one is offered for credit at another degree-granting institution and the other isn't -- are convinced that Harvard's prohibition can't last for long. GEN is now in negotiations with Stephen Jay Gould, a biologist who is an even more prominent public figure than Miller. When I mentioned to Harvey Fineberg, the provost at Harvard, that at least one of his faculty members was in discussions with GEN, he looked surprised and said, "When it comes time, I hope the faculty members will read the guidelines."
But do they apply to Gould? Or to Alan Dershowitz or Henry Louis Gates? In this new era of academic brand power, the university may be at the mercy of faculty members who are brand names in their own right.
The internet will have a very different effect on the most prestigious institutions from the one it will have on those in the middle and lower echelons. The Harvards and the Williamses are in no danger of virtualization, because both their communal life and their intellectual life are integral to their natures. They will be the brand names coveted by students at the less grand institutions, not to mention by lifelong learners. And they will, if they wish, earn lots and lots of money, which in turn could permit them, as Herb Allen and Mark Taylor suggest, to lower tuition and thus reach out to a wider, or at least different, audience. Or perhaps all that money will encourage them to behave like the market actors they will have become. Once a university permits itself to be subsumed into its brand name, it becomes, as Charles Nesson puts it, "a production house for making knowledge products."
The university can not afford a simple yes to this proposition, and it cannot afford a simple no. It can not allow its faculty members to function as free agents, but it can not bar the door to GEN and its ilk; yea, not even Harvard. Universities are already in the business of selling knowledge products, whether it's licenses and patents to scientific or technical innovations, or academic periodicals or casebooks. They can not draw a line around a certain kind of knowledge and say that the marketplace doesn't belong there -- not, in any case, if the market wants to be there. But as Dan Moriarty, the assistant provost at Harvard for information technology, puts it, the university must distinguish between activities that "preserve" the brand, and those that "harvest" it. Of course, that's easy to say if you have a $19 billion endowment, as Harvard does, and you can afford not to harvest your most precious asset. Everyone else will face some very hard choices.
Mark Taylor is a restless searcher after truth, and his passionate adventuring makes him an extraordinary teacher. Steven Gerrard, the Williams philosophy professor and critic of post-anythingism, says that he saw Taylor as an all-too-clever phony until he asked Taylor to talk to his class about Hegel. That 50-minute lecture, Gerrard says, was "the most impressive pedagogic performance I've ever seen."
I had a chance to see Taylor in action during my visit to Williams. He was teaching a course called Cyberscapes, certainly the only course in Williams cross-listed in philosophy and studio arts. There were maybe a dozen students, which seemed pretty impressive considering the terrifying reading list. That morning, Taylor was discussing Heidegger's "Question Concerning Technology," a work of numbing opacity. Taylor, in jeans and clogs, in spectacles and silver pompadour, strode back and forth as he talked. Sometimes he made a move for the blackboard and then, arrested in midsentence by a contrary thought, swung back to the class. He was so adrenalized that he seemed unable to catch his breath, and his words toppled over one another. The students watched him, agog.
Taylor's subject was not so much technology as truth -- a truth that, by the time of Heidegger, could no longer be fixed or even stated, a truth that was always hiding or sliding away. There was something thrilling about excitement so intense on a subject so abstruse; I could see why Taylor had become a cult figure on campus.
If GEN ever offers Cyberscapes, the students who take it won't feel what those students felt; that would be like eating dinner over the Internet. The Net, at least as it exists now, can convey ideas but not the flavor that comes with them, not the thrill of the unexpected. But then, Mark Taylor knows that. When I told him that he seemed to want to knock down the walls of the university, Taylor said, "No, I want to pierce them." He wants the walls to be screens. He wants to let what is outside in and what is inside out. And there is, he says, one thing he knows for sure: "These changes are coming, as sure as the tide, and trying to avoid these changes is like telling the tide to turn back."

HEADLINE: FILM;
Seeking Answers Down in the Trenches

BYLINE: By WILLIAM BOYD; William Boyd is a novelist and screenwriter. His film "The Trench" will open at Film Forum on Wednesday.

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
NOVEMBER 1998. It is 6 o'clock in the morning and I am being driven west on the M4 motorway past Heathrow Airport, heading for Bray Film Studios near Windsor Castle where, in an hour or so, the first day of filming will begin on "The Trench" -- my directorial debut. My mood is, to put it mildly, one of high anxiety.
But, as it turns out, the making of the film over the next eight weeks is one of the great experiences of my life. It represents the culmination of an ambition that has its roots in my family history and is the latest manifestation of what I must recognize as something of an obsession of mine: the First World War. 
 It wasn't actually very long ago, that tremendous conflict -- just over 80 years -- yet in Britain, and in France and in Germany, it seems preserved in our contemporary minds as something almost ancient, a tale of bygone times. The images and testimony we have -- the photos, the newsreels, the poetry and the prose -- still possess an enormous power to haunt and move. But this persistent folk-memory, so far as I can tell, isn't present in the minds of most Americans in anything like the same degree, even though the American involvement in the war lasted 19 months, during which 114,000 American servicemen died -- twice as many as were killed in Vietnam. Yet World War I's legacy is not simply a record of appalling slaughter (nine million deaths, it has been calculated, over a period of 52 months). After 1918 everything in the Western world, and that includes the United States, was irreversibly altered -- socially, economically, sexually, politically, geopolitically, culturally. The 20th century, the modern world we all recognize, was full-throatedly under way.
This may go some way to explain why in the last two decades British novelists, at least, may have felt like exploring the turbulent years from 1914 to 1918. But most writers of fiction -- and filmmakers and playwrights, doubtless -- are drawn to a subject not by its weighty historical significance but by ideas of character and story, by the potential inherent in them and by the imaginative possibilities in their elaboration. You need only to glance at any portrait or snapshot of the soldiers of the Great War to sense in yourself a burgeoning curiosity and to set those questions running: Who are you? Who did you leave behind? How frightened were you? Did you think you would die? And -- most telling of all, perhaps -- how would I have coped if I had been there?
As far as I was concerned, it all began with a lump of metal, a fragment of a German shell casing that one night in October 1917, in no man's land, during the battle of Passchendaele, hit my grandfather -- William Boyd -- full in the back. When the piece of shrapnel was removed from the wound, he kept it as a souvenir, and it has remained in the family ever since as a kind of morbid heirloom. I remember as a child holding it in my hand (it was surprisingly heavy, almost like a flint ax head); however, I never had a chance to ask my grandfather any questions about his experiences of the Great War because he died in 1952 when I was a week old. But, as I grew older, and as I came to learn more about the war, I found myself wondering with increasing frequency what it had been like. What had been going through his mind during that night when his wiring party (he was a sergeant in the Royal Engineers) was unspooling fresh rolls of barbed wire in front of the British trenches? And what did he feel when first the star shells, and then the artillery, came over from the German lines? The attempt to answer those questions, the awareness of the sheer effort of imagination involved, explain, I think, why I have written two novels about World War I -- "An Ice-Cream War" (1983) and "The New Confessions" (1988) -- and why I've now written and directed a film about it.
When I was researching the World War I chapters of "The New Confessions," I spent weeks in the Imperial War Museum in London watching miles of newsreel footage. Most of the sequences were filmed well behind the lines -- it was dangerous in those trenches, after all -- and many of the so-called action sequences are patent fakes, staged in training camps with soldiers playing dead. The real stuff, when you can find it, is unmistakable. One day, by chance, I ordered up a few minutes of newsreel about a burial party -- young soldiers lugging in dead bodies after a battle and dumping them by temporary graves. To see the sheer misery and nauseated dread on the faces of the living soldiers was highly distressing and, just for a moment, because the cameraman had been there, I was granted a tiny glimpse of the reality of what these young men, these boys, were going through.
And that is when I think that the idea of making "The Trench" was born. We forget that the First World War took place in glorious Technicolor, so familiar are we with its monochrome version. We forget also that it wasn't mute. The silence of the silent film and the sepia of the images distance the event from us, visually, and it seemed to me one of the great advantages of making a film at the end of the 20th century about the trench experience of the First World War would be that, at the very least, we would see and hear it approximately as it must have been.
I decided to take as the context of my story the Battle of the Somme in 1916. The first day of the battle -- July 1, 1916 -- is one of the defining events in recent British history. It was a day of absolute carnage, with 60,000 British soldiers killed and wounded by nightfall. Certainly the bloodiest day in the history of the British Army, perhaps even the bloodiest day of slaughter in any battle between armies, ever.
The Battle of the Somme marks a great watershed in the war itself. Without the disaster of the Somme (the four months it lasted cost 420,000 British casualties, 195,000 French, 600,000 German), the Allies might well have brokered a peace with the Germans in 1916. But after having paid such a price, to negotiate a peace would have been unthinkable.
The cost of the war continuing for another two years exceeded, in every dimension, everything that the first two years had balefully notched up. It brought the economic resources and materiel might of the Americans into the conflict too, making victory inevitable. The Allies won, the Germans lost and the severity of the conditions imposed on them by the Treaty of Versailles in 1918 sowed the seeds of Nazism, Hitler's rise to power and the other great conflict that would engulf the world in 1939. Nothing would ever be the same again.
However, as a first-time filmmaker I had some key pragmatic decisions facing me. I didn't want to make a film about fighting, because what really inspired me was my urge to come to grips with the personalities of the men involved. So, not a story of battle, but a story of young men waiting for battle and the terrible, mounting tensions that would ensue. But how was I meant to write and direct a full-length feature film about the First World War on the sort of modest budget that is considered the norm for independent European films? My answer and inspiration came from seeing Wolfgang Petersen's U-boat movie, "Das Boot." Here I saw, in the U-boat, the same dangerous claustrophobia as a front-line trench. Here was the same sweaty proximity, the same absence of horizons: the whole war confined to a few dozen men in a few dozen narrow yards. Choosing a labyrinth of trenches as the arena of the film was actually liberating. The camera, we decided, would never rise above ground level, but would rove around the trench system with the actors, almost as a ghostly witness, as the clock ticked down for 48 hours before they went over the top into battle.
As the story began to evolve, so too did their personalities, as they bickered, joked and quarreled, ate and smoked, were bored or terrified. And when the barrage lifts and the whistles blow for the attack to begin and they leave the shelter of the trench to walk across the dense, untended meadows of the Somme valley, we should feel that we have come to know them -- and the messy, desperate fates awaiting these particular young men would stand as symbols for the grotesque and enormous massacre that actually took place. My aim, my hope, was to make it authentic, to make it true, to make it real.
I looked on it as a good omen, just before we started filming, when a package arrived from one of my uncles. He had unearthed, in Australia, a whole mass of material about my grandfather's brother, Sandy. Alexander Boyd had died in 1940 and had always been a shadowy figure in family lore, having emigrated from Scotland to Australia in 1913. Now, to my astonishment, I learned that he had also fought in the First World War and had been a sergeant in the Australian Army. Even more uncannily, he had been wounded at the Battle of the Somme in August 1916. His wounds earned him a medal -- the D.C.M., the Distinguished Conduct Medal -- as he had received them rallying his company and leading them to safety (after his officers had been killed or wounded) in the face of a German counterattack at a place called Mouquet farm. My uncle had also sent a photograph of Sandy in uniform; I had never seen a picture of him before. So -- as the world of the film began to cohere and come alive -- if there was ever any ghostly presence haunting our replica trenches (and they were spookily evocative at times), I imagined it as being that of Sgt. Alexander Boyd, D.C.M.
We say, casually, that life in the trenches of the Western Front must have been "unimaginable." But it seems to me that the challenge to the artist, the challenge of art, is precisely to try to imagine the unimaginable -- to set the imagination free and attempt to bring that bizarre, boring, filthy, terrifying world to life. The war carries such a freight of history, and talk about it resonates with such grand and potent abstract nouns -- courage, duty, sacrifice, heroism and the rest -- that it often seems to me that we run the risk of depersonalizing it. In filming "The Trench," I wanted to make the First World War personal again, to recreate a world that could have contained my grandfather and my great uncle, whose photographs sit today upon the mantelpiece in my study. I wanted more than anything else to represent the ordinariness and humanity of these boys and these young men, and in that way I felt we would understand all the better what they endured.

HEADLINE: A Watchdog Leaves the Scene

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

 BODY:
DONORS who have relied on two watchdog organizations for years to evaluate national charities will soon have just one watchdog on duty. The National Charities Information Bureau in New York, the nation's largest and oldest charity watchdog organization with 15 staff members, is shutting down because financial support fell last year. Founded in 1918, the bureau operated on a $1 million annual budget.
The bureau's assets and list of 40,000 donors will be taken over by the Philanthropic Advisory Service of the Council of Better Business Bureaus in Arlington, Va. The advisory's staff will grow to seven from four to accommodate the increased workload, according to its director, Bennett M. Weiner. 
 Officials at both organizations said they were essentially merging to reduce duplication and paperwork. But only one professional from the New York bureau will be joining the council, and the bureau's standards will not be used in evaluating charities.
The council evaluates about 250 organizations at a time, Mr. Weiner said, replacing one-third of its reports every year. The bureau kept track of about 370 charities; an overlap consisted of fewer than 100 organizations.
The merger was criticized by Daniel Langan, who was dismissed from his job as the bureau's public relations director in September, just as the merger was announced. He was asked to leave for issuing a statement saying that the merger "would mean a free ride for some charities that meet Better Business Bureau standards but refuse to be evaluated by the National Charities Information Bureau because they cannot meet the tougher measurements."
Mr. Weiner said his organization's standards were as tough as the bureau's. He noted, however, that a new set of criteria for evaluation were being developed, partly because of the rise of Internet giving programs, which might fall outside traditional economic standards.
Dan Moore, the registrar of charities in New Mexico, a job that entails regulating fund-raising in that state, said that in a few years a new generation of charity watchdogs might emerge. The ability to post reports inexpensively on the Internet, he said, together with a new Internal Revenue Service policy requiring charities to file annual reports digitally, will encourage entrepreneurs to start watchdog organizations. Computer technology, he added, should make it possible to evaluate large numbers of charities at much lower costs. DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

HEADLINE: Changing the White Male World at the Top of the Foundations

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON

 BODY:
EMMETT D. CARSON had a confession to make: Minnesota has one of the largest concentrations of Somalian immigrants in the United States, but as of mid-October, there were none on the board of the Minneapolis Foundation, which he directs. Nor did he have any Hmong board members, even though there is a sizable local Hmong community. For several years, he had two Hmong trustees, but with the recent departure of one, he had none.
For Mr. Carson to castigate himself like that might seem unnecessary. The Minneapolis Foundation, an 85-year-old community foundation with $576 million in assets, is one of the most diverse in the United States. Of 26 board members recently (not counting four empty slots), half were women, seven (including Mr. Carson) were African-American, two were American Indians and one was Hispanic. His staff is similarly diverse. 
 That is in sharp contrast to the foundation world generally, where about 90 percent of all trustees are white and two-thirds are male, according to a survey by the Council on Foundations. The foundations' top leadership was even less diverse racially and ethnically. Although about half of the full-time paid chief executives were women, fewer than 6 percent were minorities.
If this makeup seems familiar, look at the ranks of the nation's wealthiest individuals, or the top executives of the largest companies. They are mostly white males. But to Mr. Carson and others, the lack of racial and ethnic diversity in the top rungs of foundations is both an embarrassment in a country that is increasingly diverse and an obstacle to effective philanthropy.
"It creates a disconnect between a value we think is important and our ability to live up to the thing we say we value," Mr. Carson said. Equally important, he noted, "It affects where the money goes."
That is not to say that an all-white male board will not support the United Negro College Fund or the Girl Scouts. At the $21 billion Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, for example, where decisions are made by four white people -- William H. Gates, the Microsoft chairman; his wife, Melinda; his father, William H. Gates Jr.; and a former Microsoft senior executive, Patty Stonesifer -- $1 billion in scholarships has already been allocated for minority students (to be given over 20 years), and tens of millions of dollars are being donated to improve health in Africa.
But in Mr. Carson's view, a homogeneous board is less likely to engage in "more risky" projects that are outside the board's range of experience. "It doesn't mean you don't have good grant-making," he said. "But it means it is harder to create trust relationships with those communities, to understand the fault lines, to listen to their radio programs and keep your fingers on the pulse. Opportunities are lost."
In a society that is becoming more diverse and increasingly prizes diversity, a growing number of foundations are trying to close that gap in their own ranks and among their grant recipients. Some are trying to bring in more minority and women trustees and grant makers, and asking their grantees do likewise. They are asking grant applicants to assess the effect of their projects on minorities and women.
They are also developing programs to increase giving by blacks, Hispanics and other minority groups. And they are sponsoring research to learn how diversity affects philanthropy.
It is a slow process, but change is beginning to occur. Consider the Council on Foundations, a Washington association of about 1,700 foundations. In 1996, the council set a goal that within four years at least a quarter of its officers and directors would be from minorities. By last December, that figure had reached 21 percent; with new hires and promotions, the goal was achieved this year.
The council also established a committee on inclusiveness to promote practices that encourage diversity at the council and among its members. And Dorothy S. Ridings, the council's president, has made progress on diversity a focus of her annual reports.
Rosie Zamora, a Houston businesswoman who is a council trustee and the chairwoman of the inclusiveness committee, knows firsthand what it is to be the only woman and the only Hispanic on a board. She has been on many such boards. As a trustee of the Houston Endowment Inc., a 63-year-old family foundation with about $1.7 billion in assets, Ms. Zamora, who heads her own survey research firm, was the first Hispanic trustee on the nine-member board and is still the only one.
"It is harder for a family foundation to become inclusive, because the family doesn't want to give up its power," she said.
One of her aims was to encourage the hiring of a Hispanic grant officer at the endowment. It happened, but it took a couple of years. She said she had also been pressing the Council on Foundations to increase its hiring of Hispanics. "They say they can't find them," she said, "and we tell them they have to do better."
She does not mind serving as a link to the Hispanic community, she said, but tries to offer other expertise, like education reform. "Being a Hispanic board member, you can't just isolate yourself to Hispanic issues," she said. "You have to find other issues that are helpful to the Hispanic community but also help business and help Houston in the global economy. You play a double role."
She added with a laugh, "You have to work harder."
The Ford Foundation is noted for its emphasis on diversity within its ranks and in its grant-making. It tracks the makeup of the board and its staff, and the diversity of both has grown considerably. And it leans on its grant recipients to do the same. In the United States, Ford's pursuit of diversity rarely comes as a surprise. But overseas, it is sometimes seen as an American construct, said Alex Wilde, a vice president and spokesman for the foundation. Mr. Wilde recalled that as a grant maker in South America, he worked with human rights groups whose boards were full of distinguished male lawyers.
"In the course of my work in Peru and Chile and Argentina," Mr. Wilde said, "I would have discussions with all the human rights organizations about how, if they were to take on women's rights issues, it would be helpful to have women who understood those issues on their boards and staffs."
The discussion, he said, would take place in various stages over several years. "We would talk about how a diverse board could be helpful to them," he said. "We would talk about the openings coming up on their boards. They would say, 'We are beginning to think along these lines.' "
In the majority of cases, he said, Ford's grant recipients concluded that diversity should be a genuine concern and made changes. "Of course, they are free to look elsewhere for grants," he said. "But rarely does it come down to that. My own experience is that many people feel it is very helpful to have these discussions."
HE added, "Basically, we're looking for organizations that share our core values, and this is part of our core values. This is an issue our trustees feel very deeply about."
Even groups that are in accord, however, like the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington policy analysis group that receives about a quarter of its budget from Ford, sometime find that cultivating diversity can be a challenge. When Inter-American Dialogue was founded 18 years ago, only a couple of its members were women, and none were on the executive committee, said Peter Hakim, the president since 1993. Today, he said, he tries to make sure that the membership is mixed geographically, racially, politically and by gender.
But when he began to seek such a membership, he discovered that he had to look beyond the corporate world, which provided most of the group's male members, and instead sought prospects in government, academia, the legal profession and elsewhere.
With help from the Ford Foundation, he helped to develop a network of women -- the Women's Leadership Conference of the Americas -- that has become a source of members not only for the Inter-American Dialogue but also for other projects.
"Not only do you put more people in the pipeline, but they bring others," Mr. Hakim said. "The moral is that once you begin to focus on this issue, it becomes something that is important to you."
Finding and keeping women staff members has proved to be a harder task, he said, noting, "The numbers aren't as good yet."

A Meal at Boxcar Bertha's Supports One for the Road

BYLINE: By DULCIE LEIMBACH

 BODY:

NAME -- Boxcar Bertha's Cafe.
 
FOUNDED -- 1999, Portland, Ore. 

MISSION -- To operate as a profitable restaurant in the up-and-coming Pearl District while providing revenue for Sisters of the Road Cafe, a 21-year-old nonprofit organization that offers job training and food to poor and homeless Portlanders through discounted or bartered meals in the Old Town neighborhood.
 
CONSTITUENCY -- Directly, people who support Sisters of the Road by dining out on the Boxcar's fresh doughnuts, grilled burgers, homemade sauerkraut and espresso and pastries, all for affordable prices. Indirectly, Sisters of the Road clientele.
 
FINANCING -- Boxcar's $274,000 seed money came through private and public grants, not including $10,000 from a city housing fund that financed the cafe's feasibility study. The grants have paid for the cafe's five-year lease, physical improvements and equipment, laundry and food supplies this first year. Boxcar, which is operating at a loss, projects that it will be profitable in three to seven years.
The business pivots around an 80-20 model: 80 percent of its employees have restaurant experience and might or might not have been homeless or poor at one time; 20 percent have indeed suffered from poverty or been without a home. The restaurant wants to eventually flip that equation. Wages are competitive; some employees are "graduates" of the Sisters of the Road Cafe training program, taking on supervisory duties at Boxcar Bertha's.
Sandy Gooch and Genny Nelson, Portlanders who wanted to create a safe, nourishing place for primarily homeless women and children, hatched the idea for Sisters of the Road Cafe in 1979. It is named after the female hobos who lived the freight-train life during the Depression. Boxcar Bertha derives its name from Bertha Thompson, who wrote an autobiography about her hobo travails.
The Boxcar is Oregon informal: checkered tablecloths, living-room-style lounge, live music. Next year's projects include installing a lunch counter, reminiscent of Edward Hopper's "Nighthawks," and a takeout window. "We'll expand on the 1930's theme," said Keith Bernhardt, a Sisters of the Road development associate.
The difference between Sisters and Bertha's is that the former is designed to serve customers their main meal of the day, which costs $3 to produce but is priced at $1.25. At Bertha's, customers are neighborhood people who can order an omelet for $5.50 while sipping a cup of the house blend for a dollar -- not Depression prices but not new economy, either.

HEADLINE: Moving Beyond the Four Horsemen of the Philanthropy Beat

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

 BODY:
THE good-news headlines are familiar. "Gates Will Donate $1 Billion Toward Scholarship Fund," declared The Houston Chronicle a year ago. "Even Elvis's TV Antenna Gets Sold at Charity Auction," reported The Plain Dealer in Cleveland, around the same time. "High-Tech in High Spirits/Silicon Valley Charity Ball raises $1.2 million at speakeasy in San Jose," The San Francisco Chronicle declared last spring.
So, sadly, are the bad-news headlines. The Tampa Tribune reported last fall on a "Former Charity Boss Charged With Fraud." A Los Angeles Times article last June under the headline "Man Accused of Charity Fraud May Surrender" reported on the pursuit of a former executive of the American Cancer Society's Ohio chapter, who was suspected of stealing $6.9 million from the charity. 
 The four horsemen of nonprofit coverage -- charity balls, big gifts, soft features about worthy programs and, of course, scandal -- have defined the general press's perspective of the nonprofit sector. But over the years, as that sector has grown to encompass 7 percent of the national income and employ about 8 percent of the national work force, these reflexive modes of covering the nonprofit world have gradually changed.
For one thing, there is more coverage than there was a generation ago. For the past 13 years, two major publications, The NonProfit Times and The Chronicle of Philanthropy, have focused on coverage of the nonprofit sector. And while higher education and nonprofit hospitals have been part of established newspaper beats, philanthropy is now a regular beat on The Minneapolis Star Tribune, The San Jose Mercury News, The St. Petersburg Times, Cox Newspapers and The New York Times, among others.
The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal have historically covered it and plan to continue, though at both newspapers the beat has lapsed. The Seattle Times's assistant managing editor for features, Carole Carmichael, has focused new attention on nonprofit issues this year; a reporter currently on maternity leave will be taking on a nonprofit beat next year.
Douglas C. Clifton, editor of The Plain Dealer, said he had talked about establishing a philanthropy beat, but added ruefully, "It's evidence of my resolve that I haven't done it yet." Other priorities, like doubling the number of health-care reporters to six, intervened. He added that as long as journalists reverted to the four forms of coverage, the beat would not be a draw for the best journalists. The coverage, he thinks, needs basic rethinking.
Earlier this year, Ms. Carmichael and 15 other journalists attended a workshop on nonprofit coverage at the Poynter Institute. James M. Naughton, Poynter's president, said, "It did seem to me that in an era particularly in which foundations were getting interested in the nature and working of journalism, that journalists ought to get interested in the nature and working of foundations."
The groundswell of philanthropy coverage is gratifying, even if the increase in competitors is a bit unnerving, said Stacy Palmer, editor of The Chronicle of Philanthropy. But she and her publication have been around long enough to see how coverage of philanthropy ebbs and flows with the cycles of the newspaper economy. "I wonder how much of this is related to the new economy and Bill Gates giving away money," she said. "When that goes away, how interested will the newspapers be?"
Just as noticeable are the new lenses the media are trying out. While writers covering the social scene will always feed newspapers and magazines a diet of celebrities and socialites having fun while doing good, the coverage of nonprofit organizations and their missions is undergoing a subtle shift.
Roll the tape back to the 1960's, the time of President Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society and the War on Poverty. Government social service programs were expanding, and coverage of nonprofit institutions tended to be an offshoot of social service coverage. That emphasis has never entirely disappeared, but during the 90's, with organizations like Doctors Without Borders playing crucial roles in humanitarian crises from Rwanda to Bosnia, there was new reporting on the nonprofit scene from a foreign affairs perspective.
Most recently, as wealth from the new economy has poured into the nonprofit sector, business reporters are taking more interest in questions like the tax implications of giving.
Peter Hero, the president of Community Foundation Silicon Valley, said that most of the recent inquiries he had fielded "are from general news reporters and from business reporters, from publications like Worth and Fortune and Forbes."
"Their stories have more to do with the deployment of the wealth of these new people," he said, adding that "there is also a sort of People magazine interest."
WHAT sets the new giving apart, he thinks, is its origin in the workplace rather than in the church or a more traditional incubator. "The biggest difference from the Carnegies and Rockefellers is that this giving is influenced not by church and by one's friends, but by the workplace," he said. "Informal networks in the workplace are driving philanthropy around here."
Lester M. Salamon, the director of the Center for Civil Society Studies at the Johns Hopkins University, said, "Businesses are seeing the value of an engagement with social issues." In addition to benefiting the community, he said, companies use charity to burnish their brands. "Corporate image is much more important than ever."
Whatever lens is used, every philanthropy can produce a list of what it thinks are ignored subjects. For Michael J. Horowitz at the Hudson Institute, a conservative research group, what matters is how the wealth of largely conservative individuals is often put to liberal purposes. For David Callahan, the research director at Demos, a year-old public policy organization in New York City, it is "the way money is going into politics under the guise of nonprofit spending."
Paul Clolery, the editor of The NonProfit Times, said journalists could "try to look at the number of people cut" from a charity's roster of clients, or what type of client the organization was helping. He added, "If you look at the type of individual served by a food bank six years ago and now, you'll see some similarity, but I guarantee you the client's income will be higher right now."
And he said: "What we're looking at is unprecedented need at food banks, unprecedented need in service programs."
Scandal coverage fulfills an important watchdog function, he acknowledged. It also tends to have more resonance than a more nuanced look at how the nonprofit sector works on a daily basis. For instance, The St. Petersburg Times recently covered the debate among foundation executives about the level of annual giving that the federal government should require before allowing a private foundation the maximum tax break.
Leslie Lenkowsky, a professor of philanthropic studies and public policy at the Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University, said that in general, "foundation mistakes and errors don't get much coverage." But he is not ready to agree that the nonprofit sector is undercovered, citing health, education and social service coverage as part of the beat.
He also sees a downside to scrutiny and the demands that charities disclose more information about themselves and donors. He fears that such close inspection may discourage anonymous giving. But he added, "One of the sadder things about charitable giving is that it is seldom anonymous."
Anonymity is indeed out of vogue; a recent report from the Council on Foundations urged nonprofit groups to be more aggressive in courting the media. But increased press scrutiny often means a warts-and-all picture of the nonprofit world, like The Philadelphia Inquirer's 1993 examination of tax-code abuses and other economic issues raised by the growth of nonprofit groups.
More consistent coverage could provide an antidote to the hypercredulous and hypercritical treatment of the subject. Nonprofit groups themselves, however, may find themselves uncomfortable with regular, dispassionate scrutiny. "People who lead organizations have to realize that with more coverage comes more points of view and more criticism," said John Thomas, a vice president at the Independent Sector, a Washington group that supports the work of nonprofit institutions. "We have to be prepared for criticism and for telling our stories in the best way we can."

HEADLINE: More Students Are Saying That a Big Paycheck Can Wait

BYLINE: By GEANNE ROSENBERG; Geanne Rosenberg teaches journalism at Baruch College.

 BODY:
LEE DAVENPORT, a recent graduate of the University of Texas, was headed for a business career. But Mr. Davenport thought he would first do a stint in the National Civilian Community Corps, a unit of AmeriCorps, a government-sponsored program based in Washington that focuses on community service.
In the late 1990's, when his classmates were entering the nation's strongest job market in decades, Mr. Davenport signed on for a stipend of about $4,000 a year, plus room and board, and a chance to help Americans in crisis. 
 Now a team leader, he talks about fighting wildfires in Southern California and assisting Florida flood victims and homeless Vietnam War veterans. "I've become really excited leading volunteers and seeing the energy and enthusiasm of people who want to give of themselves," he said, adding that he has ditched plans for an M.B.A. in favor of public interest work.
He is one of many.
"We're hearing from everywhere that there is a significant increase in young people deciding they want to work in the nonprofit sector," said Sara E. Melendez, the president and chief executive of Independent Sector, a coalition of nonprofit organizations in Washington.
Those reports coincide with increased rates of volunteering. A 1999 Independent Sector survey showed high levels among 18- to 24-year-olds. When considering all age groups, the study reflected record participation.
"The rate of volunteering is the highest we've ever picked up," said Keith Hume, a research associate at Independent Sector, who noted that the surveys have been conducted since 1988.
Despite the strong job market, record salaries for new graduates and high student loan and credit card debt, the shift toward volunteerism appears to be filtering down to college and university campuses. Career placement officers are reporting robust demand among college students and recent college graduates for public interest work.
Nonprofit experts, placement officers and a recent Harvard survey say that while students express apathy and disillusionment with the government and the political process, their enthusiasm for community public interest work is extremely high. And some companies are tapping that interest to strengthen their own employee recruiting and retention efforts.
"This stuff is sweeping America," said Reynold Levy, the president and chief executive of the International Rescue Committee, an organization based in New York devoted to helping people who have been uprooted by persecution, war or violence. "So a company would have to be very dumb to ignore this impulse, which is playing itself out across the nation."
According to a recent survey by the Institute of Politics at Harvard University, 60 percent of college students reported being involved in community service during the past year; 85 percent of college undergraduates said they preferred community volunteerism to political engagement to solve important community issues; and 60 percent preferred community volunteerism to political engagement to solve important national issues.
"We're the MTV generation," said Leslie Salba, a junior at the University of Michigan and the coordinator of the public service internship program there. "We need a quick result. We don't want to work in the background and know something will come months from now."
SOME companies are offering students an opportunity to both pursue their careers and engage in community volunteerism. That combination helped attract Monica M. Martinez, a recent engineering graduate of the University of Miami, to I.B.M. She is a network test engineer for I.B.M. in the Raleigh-Durham area of North Carolina and an "e-mentor" to middle-school students under a new I.B.M. community-service program.
The company has found that public interest opportunities and supporting its employees' philanthropic interests are valuable hiring tools.
"There's no question that there seems to be an increase in the interest among business-school students and new hires in what companies do in the community," said Stanley Litow, the vice president of corporate community relations at I.B.M. and president of the I.B.M. International Foundation. He said that good corporate citizenship and support of public interest programs, including education, "provokes a sense of loyalty in employees." He added, "It also helps enhance the value of your brand."
Nonprofit experts, career counselors, students and private-sector sources have many explanations for the increased interest in volunteering. "I think we're moving into a more idealistic time," said Virginia Hodgkinson, a research professor at the Georgetown University Public Policy Institute in Washington. There is "a wish on the part of many young people to improve their community, nation, world."
Some experts said that the strong economy had given students confidence that they could make a bundle in the stock market or get a higher-paying job later on, if money should become an issue.
As a result, students are not worried about taking lower-paying public interest jobs right after graduation. Others said that students were performing community service through high school and college community-volunteer programs and that the fervor for public interest jobs had grown out of that early exposure.
Former Senator Harris Wofford of Pennsylvania, a founder of the Peace Corps and the chief executive of the Corporation for National Service, a Washington-based government agency devoted to public service, has his own theory. He cited how John F. Kennedy inspired a generation by asking what people could do for their country.
"The No. 1 reason people volunteer is that they're asked," Mr. Wofford said. "The spirit of service and the appeal of adventure of working on the hardest problems, I think, appeals to any generation and is dormant there, and the question is, 'How do you bring it to life?' "
Public interest programs are learning how to do the asking, he said, and materialism appears to be giving way to a commitment to helping others. "I think we may find a wave of people who have done very well for a while getting back into community action," he said.
Those who have found satisfaction doing good works are sometimes less interested in financial rewards. Andrew Zuckerman, a Cornell University graduate, thought that he could embark on a business career while taking a detour into the public interest sector. Mr. Zuckerman participates in a pilot program co-sponsored by Teach for America, a nonprofit group that trains recent graduates to teach in underprivileged areas, and Andersen Consulting, a management and technology consulting firm. The deal involves two years of teaching followed by a job at the Andersen office in New York.
MR. ZUCKERMAN'S teaching experience at the Lucy Ellen Moten Elementary School in southeast Washington is challenging and sometimes invigorating, he said.
Recently, he taught his fifth graders about Congress and took them outside to view the Capitol, which can be seen from the school grounds. For many of the students, he said, it was the first time they could "look at the Capitol right in their backyards and have a complete sense of what is accomplished in that building and by whom."
Now Mr. Zuckerman is debating whether to take the job at Andersen. "I'm in too deep to get out," he said. "People get hooked on teaching. They see the difference they can make in people's lives, and I don't think they want to give that up."
Teach for America says that 57 percent of its graduates remain in education after their two-year stints.
As for Mr. Davenport, the Texan working for a unit of AmeriCorps, he intends to head to Kenya next year in a program sponsored by a Presbyterian church in Dallas, building classrooms and teaching computer classes in a small community. After the six-month assignment, he plans to pursue a graduate degree.
"I'm really looking forward to entering a school to study nonprofit management," he said.

IT has become an unspoken cultural axiom: anything less than financial well-being is a person's own fault. After all, this nation has been on a prosperity bender for the better part of a decade, intoxicated by the economy's seemingly boundless potential to generate fortunes or, at least, jobs.
Certainly, there are sober moments when the plight of those bypassed or trapped by the boom pierces the collective conscience. Mostly, though, people in need seem to be a parenthetical phrase in the rosy rhetoric of sustained expansion. 
 "Against this backdrop, you'd think the only people we have to serve in this country are the middle class, with all this talk about tax credits or whatever," said Fred Grandy, the president of Goodwill Industries International, which is based in Bethesda, Md. "There's an attitude that given full employment and a strong economy in most sectors, we've solved the problem of the have-nots. We haven't."
There are no aggregate statistics on the number of working families who are turning to charity to make ends meet. But agencies like Goodwill report a steady climb in the number of clients with annual incomes far in excess of the federal poverty level of $16,700 for a family of four. As the government continues to withdraw from core entitlement programs like subsidized housing, the private nonprofit sector has been left to pick up the slack.
Which it is doing, to some extent. Philanthropic largess is measured in head-turning numbers, according to Giving USA, an annual analysis of American donor activity produced by the AAFRC Trust for Philanthropy. Giving to human-service charities, which includes everything from crime prevention to housing, nutrition and vocational training (but not education), increased 31 percent from 1989 to 1999, adjusted for inflation, to $17.4 billion from $13.3 billion. The gross domestic product went up 35 percent, also adjusted for inflation, in that period. Donations to health services (including research organizations) rose 35 percent, to $18 billion from $13.3 billion, adjusted for inflation.
But experts warn that these sectors are getting a smaller piece of the charitable-contribution pie, their share declining to 18.6 percent last year from 21.7 percent in 1998. They also wonder what will happen when the economy slows.
"It's not that we're not a compassionate nation," said Betty S. Beene, the president and chief executive of the United Way of America, based in Alexandria, Va. "It's that we like to believe everyone is like us and lives in the same milieu. So when we hear that someone making $45,000 in Silicon Valley is living in a car, we say, 'Why don't they move?' But that is where the job for that skill is. Move? Where?"
Nowhere, said Nancy Tivol, the director of Sunnyvale Community Services in Sunnyvale, Calif. "It's almost impossible to find a one-bedroom apartment for less than $1,250 a month and it requires a deposit of thousands up front," she said. "In this area, $46,000 for a family of four is considered low income."
In this fast-beating but arrhythmic heart of Silicon Valley, Ms. Tivol blamed skyrocketing real estate prices and the cost of prescription medicine for a surge in emergency services. "The same house that costs $300,000 in other parts of the state costs $1 million here," she said. "If everyone had health coverage, we'd lose half our clients. Many of our clients never considered themselves working poor until recently."
Ms. Tivol has watched as the number of families who apply to the Sunnyvale organization has increased to 600 a month from 80 a month 10 years ago, some of them knocked from the fragile perch of economic security by an illness, a layoff or a small crisis.
Magali Estrada, a new caseworker at Sunnyvale, knows what it's like to suddenly be on the cusp of disaster. She and her husband, Carlo, a supervisor in a high-tech firm, were working when Ms. Estrada fell and broke her back. Mr. Estrada took a second job and one of their four children took on an after-school library job while Ms. Estrada was awarded disability payments. Still, the vise was tight.
"The children were demanding clothes, shoes and toys," Ms. Estrada said. "My kids had to learn to do without." The food and mortgage assistance the Estradas got from Sunnyvale were a blessing.
Zeke and Tracy Leavenworth were stunned to find themselves in the same boat. "I never imagined myself in a situation like this," Mrs. Leavenworth said.
Nor would anyone else, most likely. While Mrs. Leavenworth, 28, stays home with their three children, Mr. Leavenworth, 27, works 40 hours a week as an electrician, earning $36 an hour. But he gets no vacation or time-off pay. When Social Security, taxes, union dues, insurance contributions and the expenses of supporting a family of five are deducted from his paycheck, there is a crisis.
"It's good money," Mrs. Leavenworth said. But the rent on their three-bedroom mobile home increased $240 a month, to $1,795, eating up about half of her husband's take-home pay. Last month, a $2,000 repair bill for Mrs. Leavenworth's car put them at the brink.
"I told the landlord I would have been able to pay the rent, but then we wouldn't have been able to pay utilities or buy food," she said. "We don't have any savings. But we needed the vehicle or daily life would have just stopped. Zeke had to take his car to work or he couldn't get there."
While grateful for the one-shot help from the Sunnyvale organization, Mr. Leavenworth found the situation embarrassing.
"On paper, we should be a lot better off than we are," he said. "Two thousand dollars shouldn't be that big a deal. And we would have made it, but it would have been tough. I felt kind of bad, though. I still have pride. I thought there's a lot more people who need more help than I do."
Needing help and getting it are two different things. Ms. Tivol said a number of people hid their need. "There are a few cars that pull up to this office building between 7 and 8 in the morning, when the bathrooms open," she said. "People clean up their kids and send them to school. They clean themselves and go to work. At one point, these families were lower middle class."
THE pattern is repeated nationwide. "You have to look for the hidden signs of poverty," like families doubling up to avoid becoming homeless, said Sister Paulette LoMonaco, the executive director of Good Shepherd Services, a $25-million-a-year nonprofit social service and youth development agency in New York City. "We've seen no decrease in the number of people coming to us who need emergency clothes or food. You'd expect that to decrease in these prosperous times."
Deborah Leff, president and chief executive of America's Second Harvest, the nation's largest domestic hunger relief group, said: "People are working full time and have to make choices they shouldn't have to make -- a doctor or a meal, a prescription or a meal, housing or a meal. What's happened to hungry people in America is hidden. It's not where American stereotypes place them. They're not looking like the hungry people we expect. They're working."
Second Harvest, which is based in Chicago and operates food banks and food networks in every state, reported that demand for services was up 18 percent last year. Despite increasing the amount of food distributed this year to 1.5 billion pounds from 1 billion pounds last year, the organization turned away a million people. Ms. Leff says hunger is growing fastest in the suburbs, where housing is expensive and transportation usually requires a car. And a car valued at more than $4,650 makes its owner ineligible for food stamps.
"Sometimes I don't have enough money to buy groceries," said Cheryl Thompson, a 30-year-old mother of five in Fair Grove, Mo. "We buy them, but it takes away from other things. My husband, Chris, and I haven't had new clothing in two years. We don't buy our kids games or rent movies."
Mr. Thompson, 37, is paid $10.85 an hour to manage the flow of parts to an assembly line, a job that entails a 76-mile commute in the family's only car. From his pay, he has to deduct taxes, Social Security, union dues and a $413 monthly mortgage payment for their mobile home. Mr. Thompson calculated that it would not make sense for his wife to take a job, given the cost of child care and a second car.
"Sometimes, you get aggravated it doesn't pay as much as another job would," he said. "Then I look at other people out there who work at McDonald's, who make less money and get no insurance. They're even worse off than I am. I'm thankful to have what I do. But it bothers me when the kids need something and I can't buy it. Training for other jobs is possible, but you need time. The kids have baseball games and such, and we only have one vehicle. And you have to pay for all that training. You can't pay for it if you don't have it."
The Thompsons have health insurance through his job; Medicaid covers the children. There are no preventive checkups for them because the Medicaid clinic is open only during the day, while their father has the car at work. Their 3-year-old son has been waiting six months for a dental appointment at a clinic 15 miles away.
The family receives $55 a month in food stamps. That feeds them for about a week. To supplement, they go to the Ozarks Food Harvest Agency once a month. "The food bank helps a lot," Mr. Thompson said.
Dorothy Kurtz, 70, and her husband, Richard, 71, who founded the Church Food Pantry in Austin, Tex., can empathize.
"We have been where a lot of these people are now after one of our businesses took us down the drain," Mrs. Kurtz said. "That experience really opened our eyes for how it is to not be able to go to the store and buy what you want and pay your bills. With the cost of medicines, it was just awful."
Getting by on Social Security and subsidized housing -- they get no salaries -- Mrs. Kurtz said: "We know it's kind of hard to ask for help if you can do without, until you discover how many others in the same situation are getting assistance. It's hard to do that when you've been self-sufficient."
OPERATING for less than a year, the Kurtzes' pantry helped 549 families, or 2,131 people, in September, up from 108 families, or 527 people, in January. The food bank is open only two mornings a week, and Mrs. Kurtz is certain that more hours would increase the numbers.
"Right now, we need more funding if we're going to do that," she said. "We just did 87 families today. And they say there's no hungry people in Texas or Austin."
Local support has been strong, she said, with help from a bank, a barbershop, a grocery store and an apartment management company. There is a growing list of individuals who give at least $100 a month, and contributions are rising. Volunteers from the St. Vincent de Paul Roman Catholic Church in Austin staff the pantry.
"People know that these folks are really in need," Mr. Kurtz said. "They're down below where they should be as far as money. These people are trying. The world has changed so much lately here that they don't have the education they need and can't afford to get one."
Underlying private initiatives is a fundamental assumption that charitable giving will continue unabated. With need outstripping resources in good times, organizations wonder what will happen when the economy cools and the impulse to donate diminishes. "Until we talk about the contract between employer and employee that includes health benefits and a living wage, we fool ourselves that this prosperity is deep and lasting," said Harvey Robins, who was the deputy commissioner of the Human Resources Administration in New York City under Mayor Edward I. Koch. "The boosterism of the great economy deflects everyone from recognizing what is actually happening in people's daily lives."
Mr. Robins, who is now the assistant executive director for policy and planning at the Children's Aid Society in New York, added: "When a calamity hits not the poor or working poor but the middle class, they are only one or two paychecks away from being impoverished and in trouble. All levels of government tell them to ring another doorbell, a church or a nonprofit. But the cruel hoax is that churches and nonprofits are already stretched beyond even their expanded means. We need to redefine, again, the future role of government."
 
Hungry, Tired and Poorer
 IN the last decade, hunger-relief agencies have found that the hungriest people in the United States are the working poor. Here is a statistical snapshot of people who seek emergency help from soup kitchens, food pantries and shelters served by America's Second Harvest Food Bank, the nation's largest domestic hunger relief organization.
* There is at least one working adult in 39 percent of households receiving emergency food. Of those adults, 49 percent work at least 40 hours a week.
* Of the 21 million needy people seeking emergency food assistance, more than 8 million are children.
* About 70 percent of poor families with children in the United States include a person who works.
* Over the last two decades, the poverty rate among working families has risen nearly 50 percent.
* According to census estimates, two-thirds of parents with low earnings work in retail or service trades.
* Between 1978 and 1988, families headed by high school dropouts increased their annual working hours by nearly 12 percent, ending up with 8 percent less income.
* Of the emergency food recipients, 40 percent have less than a high school diploma or equivalent, including 16 percent who completed grade school or less.
* Forty-three million Americans have no health insurance, even for emergencies. Nearly half of all parents in working-poor families lack health insurance.

HEADLINE: Concern in Minneapolis as Target Remakes an Icon

BYLINE: By FRANK CLANCY

DATELINE: MINNEAPOLIS

 BODY:
ON Jan. 30, 2000, the Dayton Hudson Foundation one of the nation's oldest and most respected corporate foundations -- officially became known as the Target Foundation, mirroring the name change of its corporate parent to the Target Corporation.
The change was long overdue: Target, a discount retailer, had been Dayton Hudson's most profitable division for 20 years. Thanks mostly to Target's growth, the corporation's charitable giving has increased 252 percent in six years, to $81 million from $23 million when the current chief executive, Bob Ulrich, took over in 1994. 
 The sizable increase in Target's corporate giving, however, has paralleled a seismic shift in how the money is managed. The Dayton Hudson Foundation long functioned as an independent institution that distributed much of the corporation's charitable funds. Recipients of grants -- generally modest amounts of less than $50,000 -- included a wide range of social service agencies, artists and institutions.
But as the corporation morphed from staid retailer to hip marketer, strutting attitude on a national stage, the foundation has come to play a greatly reduced role in its giving strategy. In the last few years, it has distributed only 10 percent of Target's charitable dollars and, starting this year, to a smaller universe: organizations that provide food, shelter and clothing to the poor, and "programs that promote the visibility and accessibility of the arts at a community level." Target's operating divisions, each with its own charitable focus, handle most of the largess.
Because the Dayton Hudson Foundation was seen as the flagship of corporate philanthropy in a state that has been a leader in the field, the change in strategy, coupled with recent staff changes, has caused much concern.
"This community has a long history of being very pure in its giving," said Joseph Galaskiewicz, a sociology professor at the University of Minnesota who has studied corporate giving here. "By that I mean companies have traditionally given for the purpose of ensuring that needs are met."
While the Dayton family certainly thought that corporate giving would benefit the bottom line, corporate interests did not drive its philanthropic decisions. "It's still an open question whether Target's approach is to put corporate needs first," Professor Galaskiewicz said.
Unease about Target's charitable giving, and the foundation, is unfounded, said Gail Dorn, Target's vice president for community relations and a foundation trustee, who added, "We do have a new name, but we're giving at the same level, if not more, and that commitment remains."
The company, Ms. Dorn said, is continuing its 54-year-old practice of donating 5 percent of profits to charitable causes, a figure that is unmatched by most large corporations. This year, the foundation said it would be distributing $8.5 million -- about $1 million more than last year -- to nonprofit organizations in the Twin Cities. But for many beneficiaries of Target's philanthropy, the reality is that the rules have changed: after years of dealing with the foundation, they must now work with new staff, new grant-giving criteria and, in some cases, with divisions of the corporation.
Target executives say the changes amount to streamlining and consolidation, a "course correction" in the company's giving program. Mr. Ulrich declined to be interviewed for this article. But Laysha Ward, who was named foundation director in January, elaborated. "There aren't dramatic changes in the arts category," she said. The decision to support organizations that provide food, shelter and clothing was an attempt to fill a "big gap" in Target's corporate giving in its headquarters city.
"We're still going to provide support through the operating divisions for various self-sufficiency programs," she said. Ms. Ward was referring to corporate donations to programs that help young people and women learn job skills, a focus of the Dayton Hudson Foundation, which supported programs enabling people to find work.
Each of the three operating divisions has its own charitable guidelines. Target Stores, which accounted for 67 percent ($40.5 million) of Target's philanthropy last year, emphasizes family violence prevention, while the department stores division focuses on preventing child abuse and encouraging "youth self-sufficiency." Mervyn's California donates to programs that assist women and children. All three divisions also support the arts, while the department stores and Mervyn's give to education as well.
Target also encourages employees to volunteer in projects like Habitat for Humanity and a program called Operation Playground.
In framing the foundation's role, "we looked at the full range of what we're currently funding in social action," Ms. Dorn said, adding, "If you looked at what Dayton's and Mervyn's and Target Stores were funding, we had every area covered except that one" -- emergency needs like food, clothing, shelter.
Answering that need entailed a sea change in the foundation, which helped forge Minnesota's reputation as a leader in corporate philanthropy. "Giving by Dayton Hudson became kind of the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval," said James Shannon, who served as the executive director of the General Mills Foundation from 1980 until his retirement in 1988. "Other foundations, which didn't have the resources to investigate as thoroughly, saw that and concluded that the program was worthy of support."
In Minnesota, reaction to the foundation's transformation has been publicly muted -- Target gives away too much money to too many organizations for people to feel comfortable commenting for the record -- but privately troubled.
Karen Miley, a veteran consultant who raises money for a variety of social service organizations, was among the few who were upbeat. "They've honored their legacy of what was here, for years, with the Dayton Hudson Foundation. My experience has been that for the projects they were working with at the time, they made the transition, they have in no way decreased their level of enthusiasm or support."
But many leaders in the Twin Cities' close-knit nonprofit community expressed confusion and concern. "There's a lot of anger and resentment currently in this community about how the Dayton Hudson Foundation evaporated overnight and turned into the Target Foundation," said one veteran fund-raiser, who insisted on anonymity.
Others take a wait-and-see approach. "You need to look at a grant list," said Jon Pratt, the executive director of the Minnesota Council of Nonprofits, an umbrella organization. "We don't know yet how it will turn out." That list for the 2000 fiscal year will not become available until the foundation files its tax return next year.
A hallmark of the Dayton Hudson Foundation was its willingness to support an organization's general operating costs over the long term. It is a category of financing difficult to secure. Ms. Ward said she did not know yet how many groups would have their foundation pipeline shut down. A few organizations that did not fit the new guidelines have received money from other sources within the company, nonprofit administrators said.
Part of the anxiety about the foundation stems from a series of recent mergers and acquisitions that have changed the state's corporate landscape. At least 10 large companies with major giving programs have been affected, including Honeywell, which gave nearly $8 million in 1998 but moved its headquarters to New Jersey after being acquired by AlliedSignal last year. (The larger company, which took the Honeywell name, was acquired by General Electric.) 
"Dayton Hudson is just the tip of the iceberg and is symptomatic of a larger change in the community," said the executive director of one nonprofit group. "There are going to be significant consequences for this shift in corporate philanthropy."
Referring to the Target Foundation, an executive at another foundation said: "In the nonprofit sector, there is a sense of something having been lost. Even if the dollars remain the same, there are questions of motivation and access."
Access is an issue at Target partly because the foundation laid off its staff in January. Ms. Ward has assumed the responsibility of three foundation professionals while she retains her post as director of community relations for Target's stores. In that post, she supervises the divisions' grant-making in the Twin Cities.
Target officials said layoffs were needed to streamline the foundation and coordinate the company's donations in Minnesota. Ms. Dorn said the company trimmed $500,000 in administrative costs, which will be given to charitable organizations.
But the character of Target's corporate giving has changed, as it has for corporate America generally. "We have had a fundamental paradigm shift, from one where companies gave as a responsibility to their communities," said Dwight Burlingame, the associate executive director of the Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University. "Most corporations today are giving as Target is doing, tying it to the benefit of the company."
That wasn't the arrangement when George Draper Dayton founded the Dayton Foundation in 1918 and, years later, the family committed the company to donating 5 percent of profits. Mr. Draper's grandsons, Bruce and Kenneth Dayton, ran the company in the 60's and 70's, ensuring that its commitment to philanthropy continued even after the company went public in 1967. But the younger Daytons did more than give money; they acted as missionaries for giving, urging companies to give generously and act responsibly.
Under Mr. Ulrich, who began working for Dayton Hudson as a merchandising trainee in 1967 and became president of Target Stores in 1984, the company married marketing and corporate giving. According to company figures, for example, nearly four million customers, or "guests," have enrolled in its Take Charge of Education program, which donates 1 percent of store credit card purchases to a school designated by the cardholder. As of October, the company said, it donated more than $23 million to schools nationwide.
Target has also benefited: internal research showed that customers enrolled in this program spent significantly more at Target than other charge card customers.
Target successfully capitalized on another charitable interest in the late 90's, during which it donated $2.5 million to the campaign to restore the Washington Monument. It raised another $4 million donation from its vendors. Last year, Target introduced a home products line designed by the architect Michael Graves, whose scaffolding enveloped the monument.
At the foundation, Ms. Ward said that for both arts and social service grant recipients, Target would "do what we do best, which is help them tell their story -- we're wonderful marketers."
For much of its life, the foundation operated independently of the corporation, said Peter Hutchinson, who was foundation chairman and a corporate vice president throughout most of the 1980's. Mr. Hutchinson, now the president of Public Strategies Group, a consulting firm for governments, said his predecessor told him, "Mr. Dayton told me, and I'm telling you, we're responsible for nothing that goes on inside the store and everything that goes on outside." Mr. Hutchinson understood that "if we could, through our giving, enhance our community -- enhance its quality of life, its economic viability and livability; if we could make the community stronger and more vibrant, it would in turn enhance our business."
That theory was tested in 1987, when Dayton Hudson became the object of a hostile takeover attempt. The takeover was averted, partly because nonprofit groups rallied to the company's support, pressuring the state legislature to meet in a special session.
It is the independence and far-ranging interests of the old Dayton Hudson Foundation that many in Minnesota's nonprofit community fear has been lost.
Leslie Lenkowsky, a professor of philanthropic studies and public policy at the Center on Philanthropy in Indiana, put it bluntly: "Corporations now feel that their philanthropic activities have to be more allied with their business activities."

HEADLINE: South Carolinians Nurture a Little Cause That Could

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.

 BODY:
THE coastal landscape around Charleston, S.C., has long been known as the Low Country -- wetlands filled with waterfowl, beaches on barrier islands where waders can walk far out to sea and still be knee-deep, forests growing at an altitude of approximately zero and waterways shallow and deep interlaced throughout.
This ecosystem has been hit over the years by a force as powerful, if not as catastrophic, as a hurricane: the creep of urban growth, suburban sprawl and industrial expansion in and around Charleston and ports nearby. 
 So in 1989, just months before Hurricane Hugo came ashore on Charleston's barrier islands, Dana Beach and a few of his associates set out to found the South Carolina Coastal Conservation League.
How they built the organization, which in the years since has become a significant, if still relatively frail, barricade against the erosion of the landscape at the hand of man, is largely a story of philanthropy: raising money in small donations from members and in larger amounts from a few wealthier individuals and foundations.
Each type of donor makes a vital difference for a small organization starting with little more than a wish and a promise. And the group's experience is not unique: all over the country, many other local environmental groups follow a similar pattern, according to people experienced in environmental advocacy.
"Groups that are based in and working in specific places, that are relatively new, that are moving from a small to a medium-size budget, are doing some of the most interesting work," said Peter Bahouth, the director of the Turner Foundation in Atlanta, which has contributed to the league and other antisprawl groups. "They operate in that zone where the strictly local and broader global concerns meet and mix. Like the area where the water and land meet: there are a lot of nutrients and a lot of growth."
In some ways, the coastal Carolinas are an odd place to see such a group succeed. South Carolina's economic development policies have encouraged industrial development, and it is a conservative state in which environmental advocacy might not be expected to flourish. But it also has a combination of old and new landed gentry, some rich, some inclined to preservation for its own sake, and others because they love to hunt and fish. A small group can find that grass roots grow deep in that kind of society.
From its tiny start, the Conservation League has grown to about 4,000 members; in 1999, its budget was $1 million, a number that is growing rapidly.
Mr. Beach recalled that he came to the venture circuitously. It started with a business degree from the Wharton School, a stint in banking and work as a management consultant in New York. He later moved to Charleston, worked in politics and volunteered with the Sierra Club on local issues.
Gradually, he came to think that a full time, professionally staffed advocacy group was needed to protect the coast. "It's a great place," he said, "but it's definitely under pressure. It is one of the biological hot spots in the nation, and like so many others, it is under growth pressure."
In the Charleston region, the league said, population increased 40 percent in two decades, while developed land -- subdivisions, shopping malls, office parks and industrial land -- expanded 240 percent, six times as fast as the population. And there are projections that population will grow an additional 50 percent in the next 30 years.
In recent years the group has won a series of fights: overturning permits that would have allowed construction of the largest marina in the state, on Bohicket Creek, potentially degrading water quality and undermining local historic preservation efforts; helping a coalition of environmental groups defeat a "takings" bill that would have hampered government zoning controls by requiring compensation for property owners; and advocating significant changes in Forest Service plans for the Francis Marion National Forest after Hurricane Hugo devastated the ecosystem of endangered longleaf pine, blackwater creeks and bottomland hardwoods.
The group faces an especially big challenge in opposing plans for a huge port expansion in Charleston.
It was a presumptuous claim in the first place that the unknown and untested Conservation League could protect the threatened natural resources of the coastal plain by fighting what its founders considered misguided growth. "We made some undefended and unfounded assertions about what we were going to do -- some of which we did end up doing," Mr. Beach said.
Crucial early support came from founding board members, which included a core of landowners who had already committed themselves to conservation on their own property. One member who helped pull along many others was Gertrude Legendre, the owner of the Medway Plantation, which is now under a conservation easement and held by a private foundation. The most generous donor of the group's first five years was Ethel Jane Bunting, a wealthy philanthropist. When she died a few years ago, she bequeathed $25,000. Before she died, she set up a charitable remainder trust that will eventually benefit the league.
With a little of their money and their names as important collateral, Mr. Beach and his staff of "two and a half," as he put it, worked to obtain seed money from foundations. A handful of them got the league off the ground in the first year: the Hillsdale Fund of North Carolina, the M. R. Babcock Foundation of Winston-Salem, N.C., the W. Alton Jones Foundation in Charlottesville, Va., the Mary Flagler Cary Charitable Trust of Manhattan, the Merck Family Foundation in Boston and the Town Creek Foundation in Easton, Md. Altogether, the group raised about $95,000 its first year of operation.
Then it was time to build a base of smaller donors and members. "I marked 1,000 names in the phone book -- everyone I knew or had ever heard of in Charleston," Mr. Beach said. And the group began mailing solicitations.
They signed on 300 donors -- a striking 30 percent return rate. The average donation was about $40, and there were 20 donors who gave either $500 or $1,000.
From there, growth has been steady. Membership income has leaped from zero to $160,000 a year, excluding major donors. (The group's summer newsletter lists about 60 individual donors who gave at least $2,000 recently, about 70 more who gave at least $1,000 and about 100 who gave at least $500.)
Charlotte Caldwell, who is in charge of the group's current fund-raising campaign, says she makes her pitch in three steps. First, she explains that there is no other full-time coastal conservation advocacy group in the state. Then she spells out the differences between advocacy and other methods that donors might have tried, like preserving their own property in land trusts. Finally, she emphasizes the group's goals with simple examples, like opposing moves to lower water-quality standards for the benefit of the operators of animal feedlots, or opposing the removal of protective designations from scenic roads where the moss still hangs from overhanging oak branches.
Like some of the major donors she seeks, Ms. Caldwell moved back to the South, in her case from Massachusetts, and said she wanted to protect the landscape that she lived in. "A sense of place is very important to me," she said. "It is an insult to see a place bulldozed that I chose for its beauty, for enjoyment and even for spiritual benefit."
Part of the increase in major donations, Mr. Beach said, was spurred by a challenge grant in 1993 from the Lyndhurst Foundation of Chattanooga, Tenn., which matched major donations. That led to a fivefold increase in major donations over just a few years.
In 1998, the league wrote a 10-year growth plan. It has doubled its staff to 20, opened two new offices in cities nearby and is building toward a $3 million endowment to provide about 10 percent of its annual operating income. That will be about $1.5 million next year.
The overall goal is to shift the breakdown of revenues from its 1998 sources (55 percent foundation grants, 25 percent major donors and the rest smaller amounts from members) to a target of 38 percent from foundations, 38 percent from major donors and 24 percent in smaller amounts.
Board members -- the biggest of the big donors -- are crucial to meeting these targets, which will require raising $6 million in pledges over several years, enough to create the endowment and expand operations. The group expects that current and past board members will contribute about $2 million; there are 20 people on the board and the average member's pledge, Mr. Beach said, is about $76,000.
HOW will the money be spent?
The group will open an office in Georgetown, about 60 miles north of Charleston, and enlarge offices in Beaufort and Charleston ($1 million); open a full-time policy office in Columbia, the state capital ($500,000); and modernize its communications and technology programs, both for advocacy and advanced analysis of land issues ($750,000). It will also set up a $750,000 reserve and a $3 million endowment.
Groups like this rarely get national attention. But according to Nancy Stoner of the Natural Resources Defense Council, a national advocacy group, they do much of the important work on the ground. The Coastal Conservation League, for example, is one of more than 1,000 local organizations that work together through the Clean Water Network, a coalition of advocacy groups.
"Information flows two ways in the network," said Ms. Stoner, who is on the network's steering committee. "We let people in the field know what is going on in Washington; they contact the federal regulatory agencies, weigh in with members of Congress and provide local examples to prove the harmful or beneficial effects of proposed changes. And when we are developing comments on major regulations, we seek input from them. And then, people obviously get in touch with each other."
So, just as all politics is local, there are times when local philanthropy has effects far from the fields where its seeds are sown.

HEADLINE: Britons Love a Cause With Legs, Preferably Four of Them

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
IT begins with a solitary yap, then builds to a crescendo of barks, howls, whimpers and growls. In the distance, a plaintive mewing joins the chorus. Moving between the cages, humans murmur to one another and appraise the animals clamoring for attention. Charitable Britain is doing one of the things it most likes to do -- finding new homes for lost dogs and cats.
From the Battersea Dogs Home, in the shadow of a vast, unused power station on the south bank of the River Thames, some 6,000 dogs and 3,100 cats were sent to new homes last year, a process called "re-homing," which is woven into Britain's social tapestry. Recent adoptive owners include Sir Elton John and the ex-Spice Girl Geri Halliwell. Every day, around 30 strays and sad-eyed rejects find their way to the home. 
 "We lost ours four weeks ago," said Doreen Carruthers, a London homemaker who was casting a speculative eye over the home's crop of Staffordshire bull terriers, her favorite breed. "Maxine, she was called. Died of a heart attack. Now we want a new one. But it has to be a Staffordshire."
These modest courtship rituals between animal and human are generally viewed as quaint. But they reflect one of the more bizarre aspects of British giving. According to the most recent figures from the Charities Aid Foundation, a private charitable body that promotes philanthropy, animal-protection institutions ranked third, after cancer and international aid charities, in voluntary income in 1997-98, ahead by a whisker of children's charities with donations of 200 million, or $290 million, at the current exchange rate.
Among Britons, needy children are seen as the responsibility of the government's social services, said Cathy Pharaoh, the head of research at the Charities Aid Foundation.
"In the United States, they have always had a bigger sense that it is the role of the philanthropist to provide for social welfare," she added, while Britons are used to the idea that the welfare state will look after needy children -- unless the children are in far-flung lands beset by disaster. During Mozambique's floods last year, millions of British pounds were raised overnight after television films showed women and children in distress there.
Animals are on their own, which may help explain why, when it comes to bequests, they are miles ahead here. "Animal charities receive the greatest proportion from legacies at just over 40 percent," said a statement issued earlier this year by the Charities Aid Foundation, widely known by the acronym CAF.
Why this should be seems a blend of sentimentality and deeper social trends in a nation that has seen the erosion of traditional family support systems.
Britain's reverence for small, furry creatures is well known. Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother is routinely photographed with her retinue of corgi dogs. Early evening television regularly features shows -- like "Animal Hospital" -- that focus on veterinary surgeons saving sick animals in excruciating close-ups.
A sense of protectiveness toward animals is so ingrained that a vocal antiblood sport lobby has propelled its campaign to ban fox hunting onto Parliament's legislative agenda, despite the pleas from horse-riding fox hunters that such a ban would mean the demise of many hunting dogs.
So keen are Britons to shield their animals from infection that it was only last year that the authorities relaxed stringent antirabies quarantine laws by permitting people to import domestic pets, provided that the animals had the necessary health checks and shots, and an implanted microchip to prove it.
But Ms. Pharaoh ascribed Britons' attachment to animals, and their readiness to bequeath money to animal charities, to a more somber cause: "Lots of isolated people for whom pets are the only source of contact," she said.
In terms of causes and individual charities, Britons, possibly mindful of a colonial past, generally give the most to international aid agencies, among which Oxfam (an organization that focuses on the poor) emerged as No. 1 in the CAF list of Britain's 500 leading charities. The Battersea Dogs Home, which took in about 8.53 million, or about $12 million, in 1999, ranked 106, but other animal charities made the top 20. The highest ranking was the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, which is 14th on the list.
"The British are very loyal to their big, major charities," Ms. Pharaoh said. In absolute terms, Britons donated 337 million, or $488 million, to international agencies in 1998, slightly ahead of cancer charities, with approximately $478 million. Oxfam's total income was $205 million, according to CAF.
OVERALL, Ms. Pharaoh said, the income of Britain's charities, including selling merchandise, grants and investment returns, totals around 14 billion, or $20.3 billion a year, more than a third coming from public donations. But the picture remains uneven, with the smallest amounts going to charities related to AIDS and mental health -- traditionally neglected areas -- while some high-ticket charities boom.
In global terms, including its relatively huge income from investments, merchandising and entrance fees rather than voluntary donations, the richest charity in Britain is the National Trust, which owns hundreds of historic sites, castles, stately homes and gardens. Its 1998 income was $307 million, reinforcing the notion that an Englishman's home really is his castle, if vicariously.
And for the first time in 1998, according to CAF's most recent figures, the renovated Royal Opera House -- viewed by some critics as elitist -- entered Britain's top 10 charity list in 10th place, with total income of about $130 million, almost two-thirds from voluntary contributions. (This is an attractive charity for corporate donations.) By contrast, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, at No. 5, had roughly the same total income for a cause that reflects older traditions. "England is an island with a strong seafaring tradition," Ms. Pharaoh said.
But in real terms, she said, there has been little change in individual giving for several years, except that the overall number of donors has decreased, so that fewer philanthropists are making larger donations. And, Ms. Pharaoh said, "The lack of growth in corporate giving is quite a challenge for British charities."
What many charities look for is a sponsor like Tesco P.L.C., Britain's biggest supermarket chain, which adopts a charity for a year, buffing up its brand name through a display of concern while enlisting its employees to raise money for the cause. This year, said Fiona Archer, a manager of community affairs at Tesco, the chain is backing MacMillan Cancer Relief, which supports the care of terminal cancer patients. The charity's name is printed on all of Tesco's plastic shopping bags in a joint logo.
Arguably, the biggest hope for British charities lies in measures announced by Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the exchequer, in his budget last April, enabling both donors and charities to secure tax breaks on charitable gifts and, for the first time, on donations in the form of equities.
The measures, which could be worth about $550 million a year for charities, allow them to reclaim 22 percent in taxes while the government has scrapped a $145 a month limit on tax-free payroll donations.
Underlying the tax breaks is a perception among charities that the abrupt rise in wealth, created by the so-called new economy, has generated a new pool of potential givers in electronic businesses.
"I think we have come full circle and are looking at the giving age," Ms. Pharaoh said. "We are looking at an attempt to stimulate more charitable giving from those who have made a lot of money over the past decade from the City" -- London's Wall Street -- "and the dot.coms."
The pressure to exploit new sources of giving has even filtered down to establishments like the Battersea Dogs Home, which, for more than 100 years, has relied on the generosity of pet-loving benefactors. (More than two-thirds of its 1999 donations were from legacies.) Just recently, said Sophie Allen, a spokeswoman, the home organized a charity walk in which 80 of its dogs were sponsored by benefactors to raise money for itself and the MacMillan Cancer Fund. "Fund-raising is something we are only just getting into," Ms. Allen said.

HEADLINE: GRASS ROOTS;
In Milwaukee, a Chance for Free Job Training to Escape the Low-Wage Life

BYLINE: By DAN CUFF

 BODY:

NAME -- Esperanza Unida ("United Hope")
 
FOUNDED -- 1971, Milwaukee.
 
MISSION -- To empower the community through economic development by training people for higher-wage jobs. 

CONSTITUENCY -- Primarily the Latino community in Milwaukee. But the organization trains inner-city residents of all backgrounds.
 
FINANCING -- Half of the $3 million annual budget comes from the sale of products that are built or renovated by people in the program. They make trash bins, recycle donated cars and run a print shop, among other projects. The rest comes from donations from individuals, grants from corporations and foundations, and from the city of Milwaukee.
The group offers training in auto repair, welding, construction, printing, day care and customer service. Some 55 employees train 450 people a year in the free program. The job placement rate is 70 to 80 percent, said Richard Oulahan, 53, the executive director.
Esperanza Unida has branched out over the years. The organization made a big jump in the 1980's, when it bought an abandoned auto dealership and began to train mechanics. Since then, it has added two other sites and offers training for other skills in English and Spanish. It runs a day-care program and houses an alternative high school "for kids who haven't made it in the regular system," Mr. Oulahan said. It operates a coffee shop and bookstore, and has a lawyer who helps with workers compensation and unemployment claims.
Keeping the organization running "has always been tough," Mr. Oulahan said. But it has been harder since Wisconsin implemented welfare reform three years ago. Esperanza Unida had a $500,000 annual contract with the state to put welfare recipients into skilled jobs. But Mr. Oulahan said the state changed its emphasis from skill training to placing welfare recipients into minimum wage jobs. So the group lost its state contract. Money from the city has been reduced for the same reason, to $180,000 from $500,000 a year, he said.
In the last decade, the regional economy lost 80,000 industrial jobs, Mr. Oulahan said, while replacing them with 120,000 low-paying service jobs. In this low-wage economy, he said, he hopes to find family-supporting jobs for inner-city people to give them a better chance of participating in the community.
"People with low wages tend not to vote," he said. "They don't get involved in the schools or anything."

HEADLINE: More Than a Name Change: A Foundation Goes Digital

BYLINE: By ANNE EISENBERG

 BODY:
IF you want a grant from the Verizon Foundation, there is only one way to go about it -- online. From application through processing and financing, the Web is the route to this multimillion-dollar foundation's heart.
"Everything we fund is about new technology," said Suzanne DuBose, the president of the foundation, which is in New York. "For us to be a leader, we have to operate the way we preach, using new technology." 
 It also makes corporate sense, she said; the foundation's sponsor, Verizon Communications, was formed this year after the merger of two technology giants, Bell Atlantic and GTE.
Advocates of Web-based grant-making point to the advantages of e-philanthropy for both givers and getters. The Web streamlines the application process, forcing would-be grant recipients to focus and sharpen their proposals.
It also speeds up decision-making: competing applications can be readily distributed to reviewers who, freed from scores of briefcase-breaking paper presentations, can consult one another online, pass judgment rapidly and send in their results -- all electronically.
"In a cab, I was approving a grant on my cell phone," Ms. DuBose said, explaining just how fast the process can be for a philanthropist with wireless access to the Internet and a fully stocked database online.
The Verizon Foundation expects to distribute about 4,000 grants, totaling $70 million, by December, using the all-online process, she said. That is the same number of grants that were given last year, when Ms. DuBose headed what was then the Bell Atlantic Foundation.
She said that she anticipated a substantial jump in applications next year, as the education and marketing process kicked in and people in the former GTE territories learned about the cyberfoundation.
Already, though, Ms. DuBose said, the Web operations have increased staff efficiency. "When I started after the merger of Nynex and Bell Atlantic, I had 27 people reporting to me from Maine to Virginia," she said. "Now, 9 people report to me and I'm handling 50 states and 27 foreign countries."
Experts in philanthropy say that they expect electronic grant-making to spread. "My impression is that Verizon is simply doing better and more thoughtfully what many foundations and eventually all foundations will be doing -- making digital access to foundations easier and more systematic," said Woodward Wickham, a vice president for the general program in public affairs at the MacArthur Foundation in Chicago.
MacArthur, Mr. Wickham said, receives most proposals in the form of hard copy, but welcomes proposals by e-mail.
In New York, the Russell Sage Foundation, which finances and publishes research in the social sciences, allows grant applicants to submit their proposals by e-mail attachments. "It saves paper and it's far quicker," said Jennifer Nespole, a program associate.
Ms. DuBose predicts that within three years most corporate foundations will have Web-based procedures. "There are dozens of corporations that call me all the time," she said.
But while the vision of e-grant-making seems like heaven in paper-bound foundationland, it is also raising concerns regarding the exclusion of those without computer access or Internet skills.
"Verizon's policy is definitely exclusionary," said Ryan Turner, who directs nonprofit technology policy projects at O.M.B. Watch, a nonprofit research and advocacy group in Washington that works on behalf of community groups nationwide. "It puts even more of a wall between poor groups that do not use even e-mail and everyone else."
Donna House, an advocate for the Navajo Nation in Alcalde, N.M., said that "50 percent of the Navajo Nation doesn't have a phone; the rest have party lines." Access to the Internet, she said, is nil.
Greg Malhoit, a lawyer and the executive director of the North Carolina Justice and Community Development Center in Raleigh, which focuses on social and economic justice for low-income residents, said, "Many community nonprofits I'm familiar with in North Carolina still do not have access to basic technology."
And those who do may not be comfortable, let alone facile, with the Internet. "I'm glad Verizon is doing this," said Jamal LeBlanc, a policy associate at the Benton Foundation in Washington, which promotes the use of communications media by nonprofits. "But for some people unfamiliar with computers, it is going to be a disincentive."
Executives at the Verizon Foundation acknowledge the problem. Ms. DuBose's response, she said, is to point to the computers available at public libraries, community centers and outreach groups. She noted that the foundation's role was to provide basic technology to local community groups.
"Our strategy has been to build the not-for-profit centers, providing facilities so that local community users can get access in that way," Ms. DuBose said. The foundation is working with the Native American Indian Council and with the National Indian Telecom Institute, for example, to create access to digital technologies.
The foundation has also tried to make the electronic application process user-friendly, leading applicants through the process and allowing them to save their working documents on Verizon's system. They can return another day to complete the form. When applicants send paper grant applications, the foundation contacts them via e-mail, e-fax, telephone or letter directing them to the Web site.
The feedback is also faster. The names of grant recipients are posted by the system at 3 p.m. every day in a banner at the top of the Web page (www.verizon.com/foundation).
Some applicants who were initially fearful of the cyberprocess have become converts. "Now it's the way I prefer," said Karen Kelley Mears, the development director of the Northeastern Pennsylvania Philharmonic, the third largest orchestra in the state. Ms. Mears won an $8,000 Verizon grant. "They've made it very easy; you can save and go back to work on it whenever you need."
Other applicants are encouraging their own organizations to embrace the e-process. "We were uneasy about online submission," said Cao O, the executive director of the Asian American Federation of New York, which was awarded a $100,000 Verizon grant. "We were used to long proposals. Theirs is a lot shorter and you have to squeeze everything into a few lines."
Now, Mr. O said, he insists that members of his federation switch to the Web. "We found that members conceptually understand the value of technology, but they don't apply it in the day-to-day process," he said."This might upset people initially, but in the long run it will help them catch up."
For grant recipients at Verizon, it is a techno-reality. "If you are running a nonprofit," Ms. DuBose said, "and say that nowhere on your volunteer core or your staff can you access the Internet, you are probably not a strong candidate to get funding. We would question how well you are serving the community if you don't have access to the Internet."

HEADLINE: New Economy;
A novelist dissects the information age and finds a Socratic tragedy.

BYLINE: By Tim Race

 BODY:
IT'S a long stretch from Socrates drinking the hemlock to Pets.com pulling the plug. Some 2,400 years in fact. But Alan Lightman, a runner-up in the National Book Award for fiction that was awarded last week, has produced a novel connecting what the author sees as the central tragedy of each epoch.
Mr. Lightman's foreboding, sometimes darkly comical book, "The Diagnosis," his third novel, is mainly the story of the information-age meltdown of Bill Chalmers. Our man Chalmers has a wife who dabbles at selling antiques and who cuckolds him through an online affair. Chalmers is also the father of a precocious teenage son with whom he communicates more fully via e-mail than in their awkward face-to-face conversations. 
 The counterpoint to this contemporary tale is Mr. Lightman's fictionalized account of the final days of the philosopher Socrates in Athens, 399 B.C. This part of the novel unfolds in installments from Plato Online, a college course that Chalmers's son, Alex, downloads from the Internet.
"The story that I'm telling," Mr. Lightman said last week in an interview, "is a modern American tragedy -- the tragedy of how we're living our lives at the turn of the century in the United States. To give the story weight and gravity, I wanted to juxtapose it with an ancient tragedy -- a world where ideas were so important that a man could be executed for them."
Chalmers is on the fast track at a professional firm whose precise business the story never quite identifies, but where status is measured by how many gigabytes of data each worker can process on behalf of clients. There seem to be no ideas worth living for, let alone dying over. But any minute not spent talking on a cell phone, sending e-mail or checking voice mail is a minute wasted. Chalmers's life is Internet time, 24/7/365, as it might be measured by Kafka.
The accumulated weight of information overload eventually causes Chalmers's physical senses to depart him one by one. And in keeping with the book's central theme -- that information is not synonymous with knowledge, that gathering data should not be confused with understanding life -- Chalmers becomes incapacitated by a disease that cannot be diagnosed, despite endless rounds of sophisticated medical tests. In the end, blind and bedridden, he considers himself little more than a brain stem, although a brain stem that is more morally evolved than the robotic data miner we meet at the outset.
Mr. Lightman, 51, who holds a Ph.D in theoretical physics and is a professor of writing and humanistic studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said he hoped readers of "The Diagnosis" would come away with "an increased awareness of the way that we're living and the state of mind in modern America."
"We don't have time to think of our priorities, our values," Mr. Lightman said. "We're just rushing to our next appointment.
"The way that cell phones are used is emblematic. When you're on the cell phone, you're not where your body is. You're somewhere out there in hyperspace. By always being somewhere else, rather than where you are, you're nowhere. It represents the lost state of society. We're nowhere."
In the novel's back story, Socrates's primary persecutor, Anytus, a wealthy, powerful tanner, gives the philosopher a final choice -- exile or death -- as punishment for spreading ideas deemed dangerous to the established order. The ultimatum is presented in a hellish scene around putrid vats of rendered animal hides, which give off such a stench that the Egyptian slaves who attend them have long ago lost their sense of smell.
Many of the parallels between the ancient and contemporary in Mr. Lightman's novel are indirect. It is only implicit, for example, that the Egyptian slaves are forebears of slaves to success like Chalmers, rendered insensate by vats of raw data.
But a closer link is drawn between the two stories when Anytus hears that Socrates, on his deathbed, has said: "Death is only the separation of the soul from the body. . . . Men who fear death love the body, and probably power and money, as well."
Chalmers, who finds his soul only while losing use of his body, toils in a temple of modern wealth, the Marbleworth Building. The place is a monument to Edward Marbleworth, "who had made sixty million in the computer software trade by his thirty-fifth birthday and then turned that into three billion in the communications industry."
Early in the novel Chalmers is still hoping, despite the onset of his illness, to rise from junior to senior partner in his firm. He is egged on by his wife, who during most of his downward spiral is as concerned about the threat to the family's suburban affluence as she is about her husband's physical and psychic well-being.
"The pursuit of wealth for its own sake -- that is a major thread of our modern consciousness," Mr. Lightman said. "Studies have been done on this. If you give people the option of cutting down on their workweek and having more time for their families and personal lives, or keeping their workweek and having a pay raise, very few people will give up salary for more leisure time.
"In the 1950's, when a lot of labor-saving devices were being developed and personal productivity went up, there were predictions that by the year 2000 the workweek would be cut back to 20 hours. The cruel joke is that none of this happened. Instead of creating more time for ourselves and exploring other areas of our lives, we just put more and more time into our jobs and just produced more and made more money."
At the end of the novel, as he lies in bed longing to finally shed his useless body, Bill Chalmers conjures a dreamy notion of his son's future and muses, "Alex might live a life."
It is a hopeful note in a story that otherwise offers little in the way of optimism.
Mr. Lightman, who is married to a painter, Jean, and who has two daughters, ages 20 and 14, said he harbored hope that the next generation might be able to transcend what he sees as the current culture's empty pursuit of money and bandwidth. "Maybe our children have to get saturated with this stuff before they can get beyond it," he said.
When Mr. Lightman observes the undergraduates at M.I.T., "I worry about them," he said. "I have enormous respect for their minds and their originality and their creativity. On the other hand, I see them making the same assumptions about the world that our generation has made -- that more technology is better. I think something's going to have to shake them up."
He said that the bursting of the dot-com stock bubble may have brought some welcome wariness to the rising generation. "But of course, a lot of M.I.T. graduates are capable of working on the hardware end of things," he said. "So they can go off and found a company that produces a new chip and is not simply selling information on the Internet or creating Web sites."
And what bigger event might "shake up" the next generation? Mr. Lightman does not pretend to know.
"I'm not highly optimistic," he said. "I wrote 'Alex might live a life.' "

Morgan Anderson Consulting forms a unit for marketers in the new economy.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
A WELL-KNOWN consulting company that helps advertisers find and keep agencies is forming an operating unit dedicated to working with marketers in the so-called new economy.
The company, Morgan Anderson Consulting in New York, is naming the unit Morgan Anderson/Digitalis. Yes, as in the medicine used as a cardiac stimulant. 
 As if the way the Mets played in October or the recent news from Florida were not stimulating enough.
"When we started working on this, a number of people we were talking with -- venture capitalists, investment bankers -- said 'We're going to have to decide whether to jump-start some of these troubled dot-coms from a marketing communications point of view,' " said Arthur A. Anderson, managing principal at Morgan Anderson and principal at Morgan Anderson/Digitalis.
"When someone said 'jump-start,' we jumped on that," he added.
The start, with a jump or not, of Morgan Anderson/Digitalis is indicative of the intensifying interest in marketing by digital and high-technology companies as well as traditional advertisers that have expanded onto the Internet -- particularly as so many online businesses prove too hot not to cool down.
"It's a different marketing environment with different needs," said one of Mr. Anderson's clients, Deborah Sack, vice president for marketing at Dealtime.com in New York, an online comparison shopping service. "It makes sense to form a group that has experience dealing with those specific needs."
The other Digitalis principals are: Julian Clopet, based in London, Steven Cohen in Shanghai, and Ted Oda in Tokyo. Two more executives hold the title of senior consultant, both in New York: Tim Bajraktari and Jack Deitchman.
Morgan Anderson/Digitalis offers "a natural extension" of "the insights into advertising and the media industry" from Mr. Anderson and his colleagues, said another client, Richard Findlay, chief executive at RxCentric.com in New York.
Morgan Anderson is a successor to Morgan, Anderson & Company, which was started in 1985 by Mr. Anderson and Lee Anne Morgan. In 1998, the two parted ways, Mr. Anderson to head Morgan Anderson and Ms. Morgan to head Lee Anne Morgan & Partners.
The backgrounds of Mr. Anderson, Mr. Clopet and the other executives of Morgan Anderson/Digitalis include stints at agencies, as venture capital investors, in government and as marketers.
"Julian and Arthur were able to help us find a public relations agency that, to be honest, I'm not sure we would've had the guts to go after," said Leah Bailey, president and chief executive at the Tellaire Corporation in Dallas, a high-speed networking company that specializes in, as she put it, "shooting lasers from building to building with lots of data in them."
"I'd talked to agencies myself and felt I wasn't getting the attention because we're a start-up," Ms. Bailey said. "But instead of someone saying 'Yeah, we'll take you,' we really got to choose an agency we wanted." Tellaire is working with the Porter Novelli Convergence Group, a unit of the Omnicom Group.
As for opening a unit to focus on the new economy when much of it seems to be getting old fast, Mr. Anderson said: "E-commerce in one form or another is here to stay. Maybe there will be fewer dot-coms, but hey, there are fewer advertising agencies, too."

Supercomputing Takes Yet Another Turn

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
The world of supercomputing, which revolves around modeling complex phenomena like how weather changes, drugs work and accidents unfold, is rarefied by any standard. It has long been the domain of folks who call themselves the nerdiest of nerds and who regard Deep Blue, the I.B.M. computer that defeated the chess champion Garry Kasparov, as no big deal.
Once, it was the exclusive province of custom-designed machines with elaborate cooling systems made by companies like I.B.M. and Cray Research for government research laboratories and giant auto, petroleum and chemical companies. Then, starting in the early 1990's, I.B.M. and new rivals like Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems and Compaq Computer rapidly shifted to systems that lashed together the same processors used in common business computers, relying on software to break supercomputing's giant challenges into bite-size pieces. 
 Now, in the latest wrinkle, the dominance of such clusters is being challenged by the arrival of start-up companies offering methods of doing supercomputing over the Internet on home and office computers that would otherwise be idle.
"There are 100 million machines hooked to the Internet, all of them doing nothing a lot of the time," said James Gannon, chief technology officer of Parabon Computation, one of several first-time exhibitors in Dallas this month at supercomputing's biggest trade show. "This kind of inefficiency just can't exist in a free-market economy."
The potential of such Internet-based supercomputing, also known as grid computing, has been highlighted by the SETI@Home project (for Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence), a nonprofit effort that has signed up two million computer owners to help crunch data obtained by radio telescopes scanning the skies for signs of life. The program runs as a screen saver when the computers are otherwise idle. Averaging more than 12 trillion calculations a day, SETI has become one of the planet's busiest supercomputing efforts.
At the Dallas show, the start-ups advertising their efforts to build a grid computing business included companies like Applied MetaComputing, based in Charlottesville, Va., Entropia, based in San Diego, and KnowledgePort Alliance of Champaign, Ill.
And there was Mr. Gannon's company, Parabon, based in Fairfax, Va., which said in September that it had signed up so many computer owners in just 80 days that it could provide clients with enough computing power to rank among the top 100 supercomputers in the world.
The grid computing companies have, so far, been able to sign up thousands of computer owners simply by offering token payments, opportunities to be in lotteries or contributions to charity. But how many traditional supercomputing challenges will fit such a model is very much in doubt.
"The sector is going through a personality crisis," said Debra Goldfarb of the International Data Corporation, supercomputing's most prominent analyst.
The major vendors are not willing to invest much in sorting the trends out. The current market leaders -- Hewlett-Packard, I.B.M., and Sun Microsystems -- are tightly bunched with market shares of just more than 20 percent apiece. But the entire technical computing market accounted for just $5.7 billion in sales last year, according to International Data, and none of the major players outside of Cray treat supercomputing as a distinct business in their financial reporting.
The long-term trend toward building supercomputing systems out of products developed for other sectors has clearly spread access to supercomputing, but some experts say the broadening of the market has diverted technology development away from the needs of hard-core users, who make up a $1 billion niche market, according to International Data. They argue that many problems -- detailed weather prediction, the behavior of the Internet, an atomic perspective on how proteins behave or what happens to the organs and other soft tissues of passengers in auto crashes -- need much more rapid data sharing than Internet grids or even dedicated clusters of off-the-shelf computers can generate.
"We do the whole gamut of supercomputing, but the really tough problems get solved on real expensive hardware," said Vincent F. Scarafino, manager of numerically intensive computing at Ford Motor.
The big computer companies agree. Hence plans like that of I.B.M. to invest more than $100 million in Blue Gene, a supercomputer dedicated to studying genetics and other fundamental problems in biology, or the Japanese government's commissioning of NEC to build the world's most powerful supercomputer, called the Earth Simulator, to study global warming, El Nino cycles and other global environmental events.
At issue, though, is the degree to which such computer users need -- and are willing to pay for -- custom-designed processors, networking, memory systems and software to optimize their performance. Even Seymour R. Cray, the designer of the earliest supercomputers, had given up the battle and turned to off-the-shelf components for the design he was working on at his last business venture, SRC Computers, when he died in 1996.
The major vendors say supercomputing's biggest challenge is developing software to use the available power efficiently in analyzing real-world problems.
"We've done spectacularly well from a hardware point of view," said Irving Wladawsky-Berger, who headed I.B.M.'s shift from traditional big-iron computers to systems based on arrays of processors. "All those Porsches and nowhere to drive."
No one doubts that better software would help, but how fully can it compensate for the vendors' retreat from investment in hardware designed specifically for supercomputing's toughest challenges? Ms. Goldfarb estimates that perhaps 20 percent of supercomputing problems are not easily broken down into pieces that can run efficiently in the highly distributed world of the Internet or even on dedicated clusters of commercial servers.
Researchers say tasks with many variables that are constantly changing and influencing each other require not just processing power, but also extremely rapid and wide paths for exchanging data, and advanced memory and database management and system designs that keep processors from being idle for even tiny fractions of a second. Thus, when supercomputers built with commercial operating systems around highly parallel arrays of standard processors tackle such challenges, they often perform at 5 percent of their rated speed or less.
As a result, the widely publicized, semiannual list of the world's most powerful supercomputers is misleading at best. Companies that do well in the listing use it for bragging rights -- most recently, I.B.M.'s presence in the ranking has been soaring -- but users and vendors alike agree that it is based on tests that have almost nothing to do with how useful the computers are.
Users are trying to come up with more realistic bench marks to help explain to Congress and other sources of financing why expensive computers that look slower on paper might be better buys. To underscore their concerns, they note that the record for sustained performance on a real application was set two years ago by a Cray computer running at little more than a fifth the speed rating of the I.B.M. computer that currently tops the raw speed rankings.

Chart: "Supercomputing Eras"
1960's -- The first supercomputers, made by Control Data, were based on large, custom designed processors and memory systems allowing users to perform technical calculations at far greater speeds than on business computers. Seymour R. Cray introduced vector processing, which optimizes the handling of problems in which the same sequence of calculations needs to be done repeatedly on big streams of data.
 
1970's -- Illiac IV, built by Burroughs for NASA, linked 64 separate processors in the first effort to make supercomputers whose processors could work in parallel. But rapidly improving vector computers from I.B.M., Cray and others dominated the market.
 
1980's -- The rapid development of microprocessors led to the founding of startups like Thinking Machines, Kendall Square and Ncube that created so-called massively parallel systems.
 
1990's to present -- I.B.M. and others adopted parallel processing, linking clusters of standard processors. By mid-decade, researchers built inexpensive "Beowulf" clusters by linking desktop computers and using the free Linux operating software. Vector computing largely faded though Japanese companies continue to improve it. Now ventures have sprung up to perform massive calculations over the Internet on idle home and office computers.

Shop, E-Mail and Web Surf on the Telly

BYLINE: By SUZANNE KAPNER

 BODY:
Calvin Butler does not own a computer, nor does he have access to the Internet at the Birds Eye frozen food plant where he works as a machinist near his home in Suffolk, England.
Nevertheless, Mr. Butler, 44, is an avid participant in the new economy. Like millions in Britain, he is using his TV set to shop and send e-mail and for many other tasks normally associated with the personal computer. 
 Mr. Butler is hardly alone. The Henley Center, a market research firm based in London, estimates that by 2005 more people in Britain will log onto the Internet through their TV's than on their PC's.
Already 4.6 million households in Britain, or 20 percent, use some form of interactive television, a broad term that encompasses everything from enhanced broadcasting to Internet use. Only slightly more households, 29 percent, surf the Net from a home PC, according to Forrester Research.
Those figures are particularly striking when compared with the United States, where despite its reputation as a technological wonderland, interactive TV has yet to catch on. Just 600,000 American households, or 0.6 percent, use interactive television, Forrester estimates, compared with 43 percent with PC's in the home.
The disparity says as much about how technology is adopted by the general public as it does about what the new economy may look like as it matures. In the United States, broadcasting and the Internet have developed in parallel universes; in Britain they are increasingly intertwined.
While Microsoft learned a hard lesson about the reticence of American consumers to use WebTV, companies like PowerChannel Europe, backed by Granada Media, and Ondigital, owned jointly by Granada and Carlton Communications, say they have a special opportunity in the broad swath of the British population that does not own a computer.
PowerChannel, which offers free set-top boxes in return for their personal data, ran trials in the United States and Britain, but chose to start in Britain because of the "lower PC penetration and the greater comfort individuals have with interactive TV," said James Gambrell, PowerChannel's president.
The seeds of interactive television were planted in Britain nearly two decades ago with a service that provided television subtitles to the hearing-impaired. Nurtured by the government, which gave tax benefits to broadcasters that used it, Teletext, as the service came to be known, conditioned Britons to expect more from their TV's than just the latest sitcom.
Today nearly 10 percent of late-availability vacations are booked through Teletext, according to industry estimates, and the service has become a familiar way to check the latest sports scores or weather reports.
Making the leap from a one-way text service to interactive TV that allows viewers to edit news broadcasts, choose camera angles and play along with their favorite quiz show required the cooperation of the media industry in setting standards that would allow the new technology to be transmitted to set-top boxes regardless whether they were hooked to cable or satellite systems.
In contrast to the United States, which currently has three different broadcast specifications, Europe is moving toward a common platform called digital video broadcasting in much the same way it created common standards for the transmission of mobile phone frequencies.
"Europe is easier to deal with, because it's all under one umbrella," said Jim Beveridge, director of MSTV Europe, a division of Microsoft.
Even so, interactive TV probably would have developed less rapidly in Britain had it not been for pay-per-view television. In England, the rights to sports events and other kinds of premium shows are auctioned to the highest bidder. Fans who want to watch a Manchester United soccer match, for instance, must pay as much as 30 ($42.69) a month to British Sky Broadcasting, part of the News Corporation, which owns the rights to broadcast Premiere League games.
In that regard, Britain differs even from Continental countries like Germany, where sports are considered cultural events and broadcast on public television. In the United States, with free network broadcasts and so many channels available for so little on cable, consumers are less likely to seek new services, said Reineke Reitsma, an analyst with Forrester Research.
"Pay TV is the carrier for interactive services," Ms. Reitsma said, explaining that British broadcasters are bundling these new services with existing pay-per-view packages as an incentive for subscribers. Digital media companies collect revenue from advertising and share profits on purchases and product placement, much the way portals do on the Internet.
British Sky Broadcasting is the largest digital service with 4.5 million subscribers; next in line is NTL Inc. with 3 million. And both are shoveling new interactive services like banking, shopping and e-mail to their customers with a vengeance.
Does that mean they will be the AOL's of the interactive age? Not quite.
The PC is still expected to generate the lion's share of revenue from advertising and e-commerce, which could total 52 billion euros ($44.33 billion) by 2004, or more than six times the 8 billion euros ($6.82 billion) generated from interactive TV, according to Jupiter Research. Mobile phones are forecast to contribute just 3 billion euros ($2.56 billion).

Web and catalog businesses are crossing into storefront territory, creating parallel avenues of retailing.

BYLINE: By Bob Tedeschi

 BODY:
SLEEP is coming more easily these days to traditional retail executives, who by now barely become excited over the dot-com body count, or the latest e-tailing stock to drop below a buck. Gone are the days when they agonized about being "Amazoned," or blind-sided by a dot-com, and when the phrase "first-mover advantage" conjured images of 20-year-old Stanford drop-outs destroying their lives.
But in some retailing areas, like apparel, goods for teenagers and others, the bricks-and-mortar executives have not yet subdued the e-commerce threat. Indeed, for them, that battle has shifted from the dot-com battlefront to the storefront, as Internet and catalog companies build stores to compete directly with the mall-based brands. 
 And even though traditional retailers were first to try the twin "clicks-and-mortar" approach, analysts said it might be easier for Internet and catalog merchants to open stores than it is for bricks-and-mortar merchants to sell directly to consumers online.
By pursuing the ideal of so-called multichannel retailing, companies hope to cash in on the well-worn notion that successful retailers must serve customers wherever and whenever they want to be served -- whether through a catalog, the Web or in a store. For traditional merchants and catalogers, the initial move in the direction of cyberspace was, of course, a defensive measure. No one could be sure how many customers would gravitate toward e-commerce, and few could justify to their investors a strategy of not rolling out a Web operation and thereby missing out on a public stock offering.
After retailers like Macy's and Gap built their Web divisions, they saw how close that brought them to a catalog operation. And given how many consumers still lack Internet connections, they saw the fiscal wisdom of such a move. Internet retailers embraced catalogs for similar reasons.
But while e-tailers and their traditional counterparts have struggled to show profits on the Web, catalogers who opened Web operations have flourished. And a handful of them are now opening land-based stores, and they are being joined by a few companies with e-commerce pedigrees and just enough money and nerve to think they can follow the lead of J. Crew, Victoria's Secret, Recreational Equipment and other successful retail crossovers.
Lucy.com, which sells women's sports apparel, is one example of a previously Internet-only company moving into storefront retail. Next month, the company will open its first store -- in Manhattan, on Second Avenue, between 58th and 59th Streets.
According to Sue Levin, Lucy.com's chief executive, the company's retail strategy quickly followed its catalog rollout, which itself began shortly after the Web site opened late last year. "From the beginning, we've wanted to get away from that ephemeral 'e-tail' categorization, and this is another step in that direction for us," Ms. Levin said.
Lucy.com will test the first store before agreeing to move into other locations around the nation, Ms. Levin said. She added that the store would be a modest size -- 1,000 square feet -- and would cost "in the low-to-mid six figures" to build.
Aside from escaping the stigma of an Internet-only merchant, Ms. Levin said there were several, more tangible, benefits to moving into retail. Among other things, "the store is a lab for us," she said. "We'll be in the trend-setting New York market, so we'll be learning a lot by interacting with customers face to face and applying that knowledge to our catalog and Internet business. That's critical."
While stores can help shape the online and catalog businesses, other executives said the reverse was true to an even greater degree. Coldwater Creek, an Internet and catalog retailer of women's apparel that began a national retail rollout of about 80 stores earlier this year, is a prime example.
According to a spokesman, the company was searching for a store location outside Chicago, and narrowed it down to five possibilities. It then reviewed its database of 10 million customers, and saw that 260,000 lived within a 50-mile radius of Deer Park, Ill., some 40 miles northwest of Chicago. A new store opened there last month.
In addition, the company advertises the stores in the pages of the 150 million catalogs it mails annually, and it asks its catalog and store customers for their e-mail addresses so Coldwater can send news of store openings and promotions on the Net. "Managing all the synergies between direct marketing and the stores has been a real plus for us," said Georgia Shonk-Simmons, president of Coldwater Creek's catalog and retail division.
But the advantages of direct marketing go only so far, said Chris Edgar, vice chairman of Delia's, a cataloger and e-tailer of teenage girls' clothing that opened the first of its 31 stores last year. "Being a multichannel retailer gives you powerful tools to grow and refine your store model quickly," Mr. Edgar said. "But it doesn't absolve you of the requirements of someone who's just a store retailer."
For instance, Mr. Edgar and other executives said that merchandising for a store is completely different from merchandising for a catalog or a Web site and that what works in one store may not work in the next.
In theory, analysts said, retailers with strong Internet and catalog expertise could use those channels to better forecast and manage inventory, shifting products to wherever they might sell best. "That's definitely a possibility," Mr. Edgars said. "But it's a little early for us to quantify that because we've only been at this for a matter of months, and we're just learning how to use the various tools."
Indeed, online and catalog retailers have a fairly steep learning curve when it comes to selling in stores, said Chris Merritt, principal of Kurt Salmon Associates, a retail consulting firm. "You have to have a real mindset shift in how you spend money," he said.
For instance, Mr. Merritt said that executives from catalog and Internet companies were accustomed to being able to adjust their marketing budgets at the last minute, if possible, depending on their priorities and expectations.
"But with stores, it's much harder to react as quickly -- just cut one or bump up -- because they can take a couple of years to do," Mr. Merritt said.
Buying enough merchandise can also be a problem, he said. "On the Internet or with a catalog, you can get away with only carrying a small number of items in fringe sizes," Mr. Merritt said. "But in a retail store, if you don't carry all the sizes, customers might get the impression that the selection is thin, and they'll leave."
To get up to speed, most catalog and Internet companies that open stores hire traditional retail executives to shepherd the company through the expansion. An example is J. Jill, a women's apparel merchant that started as a cataloger, added a Web business early last year and shortly thereafter embarked on a retail store effort.
That expertise is crucial, said Gordon Cooke, the chief executive of J. Jill. Still, he said, companies with a direct marketing background -- be it on the Web or through a catalog -- have a much easier time converting to multichannel retailing than traditional merchants do. "No question who has it easier," he said. "It's a slam dunk."
Mr. Cooke, who was a Bloomingdale's executive for 17 years and helped start the company's mail-order business, said that "once you've mastered selling one-to-one, which is so difficult, and where you have a whole distribution system to service each customer, it's significantly easier to move to mass market. Retailers just don't have any comprehension of what that means."

HEADLINE: U.S. Move Improves Chance For Global Warming Treaty

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

DATELINE: THE HAGUE, Nov. 19

 BODY:
In a shift that is likely to brighten prospects for a global warming treaty, American negotiators at talks here have said the United States would be willing to limit its use of forest projects to reach its target for reducing heat-trapping greenhouse gases.
The new stance, signaled in the face of mounting criticism from Europe and private environmental groups, came this weekend, halfway through a contentious two-week session aimed at writing the fine print for the treaty, called the Kyoto Protocol. 
 The treaty was worked out by more than 170 nations in Japan in 1997. If ratified, it would commit three dozen industrialized nations to reduce their combined greenhouse-gas releases by 2012 to at least 5 percent below emissions in 1990, with each country taking a unique target depending on its emissions.
But the rules and means to achieve cuts have never been resolved, with this session, called the Sixth Conference of the Parties, intended as the denouement.
Many disagreements in these pivotal negotiations have focused on the role of forests as "sinks," in which carbon dioxide, a warming gas flooding the atmosphere from the burning of fossil fuels and forests, is removed by trees, which store the carbon in wood and soil.
The United States, by far the largest emitter of greenhouse gases, calculated last summer that its vast forests, by absorbing up to 300 million tons a year of carbon dioxide, could help it get halfway to its pledged target under the treaty, reducing emissions by 2012 to 7 percent below where they were in 1990. It also wants to get credit for paying for forest-protection and tree-planting projects in other countries.
But Europe, too crowded to take advantage of forests, and many private environmental groups say crediting forest growth would allow the United States and other large, forested countries to meet their targets without undertaking the much harder, and potentially costlier, task of reducing greenhouse gases at the source: mainly tailpipes and smokestacks.
"This is a major free ride for the U.S., a get-out-of-jail-free card the likes of which has never been seen," said Kert Davies, a representative of Greenpeace USA lobbying at the talks.
Last week, in sharply rejecting a preliminary American proposal for phasing in the use of forest credits, the European Union described sinks as "a free gift."
Frank E. Loy, the under secretary of state for global affairs and chief American negotiator, said forests were one of several treaty components that American negotiators see as essential to any agreement that is both effective and cost-effective -- and that will satisfy a highly skeptical Senate, whose approval the treaty needs.
"If an agreement doesn't take into account the fact that forests can act as a huge source of emissions as well as an important opportunity to reduce emissions, it will be a very unsatisfactory exercise," Mr. Loy said.
But other American negotiators explained that they were prepared to compromise on the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by forests for which a country could receive credit, moving beyond an earlier proposal that would phase in credit for forests from 2008 to 2012.
"We are prepared to discount some of the tons that would come through the process," one official said.
Mr. Loy said the United States was committed to acting aggressively on home turf to curtail emissions, but insisted that there should be flexibility to use every emissions-cutting tool available wherever it could be used most effectively.
"We've always thought of sinks as being part of the answer," he said. "They're not intended to take the place of investments in environmentally sound technologies."
In a news conference late last week, Jos Delbeke, the head of the climate section of the European Commission, said that so far, the American proposal was "far too vague and far too incomplete" and would be acceptable only when there were hard numbers showing a clear retreat from large forest credits.
Many other disagreements between blocs of countries remained unresolved over the weekend, including whether countries should be able to get credit toward emissions goals for investing in pollution-cutting projects abroad, and whether such projects should include controversial technologies like nuclear power and "clean coal" plants -- or forest projects.
Environmental campaigners used theatrics to make points. On Saturday, several thousand people from 40 countries built a dike of 50,000 sandbags around the sprawling convention center, meant to highlight one of the perils expected in a warmer world. Scientists predict that continued global warming will disrupt ecosystems and weather patterns and also raise sea levels as glaciers melt.
In the lobby, demonstrators presented a petition seeking much deeper emissions cuts to the president of the conference, Jan Pronk, the Dutch environment minister. "We're trying to build a dike of words," Mr. Pronk responded.
Acknowledging the rifts still sharply dividing countries, he added, "It's extremely difficult to take actions now to protect people not yet born, but that is what we are trying to do."
As several thousand delegates combed through hundreds of bracketed paragraphs in reams of treaty text, lobbyists for companies touting everything from windmills to nuclear plants roamed the hallways, along with a similar number of campaigners from environmental groups.
Despite the clashing mosaic of stances, many delegates, from both rich and poor countries, said they had a sense -- after more than a decade of meetings leading to the treaty -- that agreement could be reached, mainly because a growing number of nations were seeing the deal as an opportunity for economic growth and not simply an environmental pact.
"There is no great aggressiveness from the developing countries now, not like there was in 1990," said a delegate from a large Asian country. He added that rich countries, in turn, are now asking "how do we expand commercial investment opportunities and sell our technologies."
Observers who had attended previous talks agreed that the atmosphere was different, and that Europe and the United States -- despite outward discord -- seemed poised for compromise.
"The gulf doesn't seem to be as wide," said Senator Michael B. Enzi, Republican of Wyoming, a coal-rich state. He attended the Kyoto talks and another session in Buenos Aires and remains skeptical that the treaty will be fair to the United States. "Compared to Kyoto," he said, "they almost appear to be agreeing."
Still, some camps seemed determined to scuttle the talks. One point deemed essential by the United States is some clause that at least implies that fast-growing countries like China and India commit more concretely to initiate climate-protection programs. The Senate has said it will not approve a treaty without this.
To some, this presented an opportunity. A person working with oil-producing countries described how they were successful -- for the third climate-treaty conference in a row -- at putting pressure on the organizers before the opening gavel to delete from the agenda any consideration of such a commitment from developing nations.
On Sunday afternoon, as delegates girded for the increasingly intense sessions to come, many sought guidance at an "Ecumenical Service on Climate Change" at the Cloister Church.

HEADLINE: In America;
This Is The Easy Part

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
Incredibly, the year 2000 is almost over. It flew by in an instant. And yet the biggest story of the year, the presidential campaign that ended in a virtual deadlock, is moving so agonizingly slowly it seems to have stopped time altogether.
Score one for relativity. 
 There are no answers, only questions. Will we have a president-elect by Christmas? Do we have time to change the Constitution and give Clinton one more term? (There's no reason to be mad at him anymore. He finally told the truth about Monica and he finally went to Vietnam.) Does either candidate realize that the biggest loser at the end of this fiasco will be the winner?
I actually think there is a chance George W. Bush realizes this. He does not seem to enjoy doing the things that presidents do. You got a sense of that when he had to be hustled into a car last Wednesday night and rushed the 90 or so miles from his ranch near Crawford, Tex., to Austin so he could deliver a nationally televised response to Al Gore's surprise TV appearance a few hours earlier. No one thinks Mr. Bush was happy about that. He had a somewhat startled look during the brief address, as if he were thinking, "What am I doing here?"
One of the more telling newspaper articles from last week was Frank Bruni's piece in The Times on Friday describing how Mr. Bush remained for the most part tucked away at his ranch as the high-tension election drama unfolded. Mr. Bruni noted that the ranch is not equipped with cable or satellite television, and there are only a few local TV channels.
Mr. Bush hardly seemed on top of things. He played with his dog, Spot. He ran. He lifted weights. And he hacked away at unwanted vegetation that cropped up here and there on the ranch.
Wrote Mr. Bruni: "While lawyers wrangled and pundits bickered, the Texas governor traveled in his imagination to fields of less complicated dreams, plunging into the pages of a new biography of Joe DiMaggio."
A friend was quoted as saying, "He just doesn't like the mess."
Well, this mess is small potatoes compared with some of the problems Mr. Bush might have to confront as president. An economic meltdown, for example. Or war. And when there is a crisis in this country or elsewhere in the world, you want the president to be all over it. You don't want him escaping in his imagination to fields of less complicated dreams.
The presidency is all about crises, one after another, 24-7. It's fair to wonder if Mr. Bush is wondering just what the heck he is getting himself into.
Al Gore has a different kind of problem. He really, really wants to be president. He can't wait to roll up his sleeves and begin wrestling with crises. He's smart. He's ready. He's not about to retreat to anybody's ranch.
And yet, the latest reports out of the Florida venues where the hand counts are being conducted are ominous for Mr. Gore. He is not piling up huge numbers of additional votes from the recount. Not yet, anyway.
The Florida Supreme Court has said the hand recounts can continue. And a hearing is scheduled for this afternoon at which the two sides will argue whether the results from the hand counts should be included in the statewide totals.
Meanwhile, it's comforting to keep in mind that as tedious and as nasty and as wearying as this election dispute has become, the system is working reasonably well. Americans are not shooting at one another or rioting in the streets. They're watching television. A new poll from Newsweek magazine said 61 percent of Americans believe it's more important to have a fair and accurate vote count out of Florida than it is for the winner of the presidency to be decided quickly.
This election did not produce an obvious winner. But the nation is confident that a president will be peacefully selected and that the next election will take place as scheduled and will be fine.
I remember the catastrophe in Haiti in 1987 when an election was scheduled but men with guns and machetes showed up and massacred voters at the polling stations. The election was canceled.
We don't do things that way here. When there's a dispute or a deadlock we argue it legally in the courts and fight it out philosophically through the media. And then a winner is declared. And then we move on.

HEADLINE: CLINTON IN VIETNAM: THE SENATOR-ELECT;
Hillary Clinton Sings Praises of Vietnam Women, and Vice Versa

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam, Nov. 19

 BODY:
Hillary Rodham Clinton, not yet a senator and not quite a former first lady, brought her trademark mixture of feminism and family values to Vietnam today, telling an audience made up largely of women that "anything we do to help women helps children and families and society."
Mrs. Clinton paid homage to the exalted place women occupy in Vietnamese history as well as their central role in the country's commercial life. She singled out the woman who is the leader of one of Vietnam's major state-owned companies as an example of someone who embodies the advances made by women here. 
 "She is a very impressive businesswoman who represents the promises of the new economy," Mrs. Clinton said of Nguyen Thi Mai Thanh, who runs the Refrigeration Electrical Engineering Enterprise.
Mrs. Clinton also invoked the legendary Trung sisters, who rose up centuries ago to defeat an invading Chinese army. The elder sister briefly became Vietnam's queen, until the Chinese returned to overthrow her.
The audience today -- and crowds at every stop during this three-day visit -- have embraced Mrs. Clinton's message and celebrated her new status.
The leader of the local women's union, Nguyen Thi Lap Quoc, congratulated Mrs. Clinton on winning a Senate seat and offered some free advice. "Always be charming, intelligent and energetic," the union leader said.
Yet the good feelings generated by Mrs. Clinton's presence have papered over the more complex reality of women in Vietnam. Some experts argue that the role of women has been distorted and mythologized, both in ancient history and through the Soviet-style propaganda of the Communist Party.
The image of a woman as a guerrilla holding a machine-gun in one arm and a baby in the other is an enduring one here. The latter-day equivalent is an entrepreneur balancing a cell phone and a baby.
But Brian J. M. Quinn, the former director of a Harvard University program that teaches business to Vietnamese students here, said, "For all the talk about the advanced status of women, the numbers just aren't there."
Mr. Quinn said that in recruiting women, he found that fewer than 5 percent of provincial officials are women. More than a quarter of the members of the National Assembly are women. But in the more influential Politburo, there is only 1 woman out of 19 members.
While Ms. Thanh, of the refrigeration company, is a genuine success story, Mr. Quinn said she is almost alone as a high-powered businesswoman. A more common example is Simone Mai, a 49-year-old shopkeeper.
Ms. Mai, the daughter of a former South Vietnamese military officer, has sold silk neckties on one of the tourist streets in Ho Chi Minh City for 15 years. She is several months behind in paying her taxes and mobile-phone bill, and fears that the state will shut down her shop.
Part of the problem is that the demand for Ms. Mai's ties has dwindled with the spread of casual dress codes in offices. "There are a lot of tourists, but they don't wear ties anymore," Ms. Mai said forlornly.
Many women here may be struggling. But Mr. Quinn noted that "within the Vietnamese family unit, the impression is that they still run the show."
Mrs. Clinton got a taste of that on Friday, when she ventured outside Hanoi to visit a village where dozens of women have parlayed small loans into thriving businesses to breed pigs and make tofu. While the women proudly shared their achievements, their husbands lurked behind doors and fences, smiling shyly.
"Women in Vietnam have played, and continue to play, a more active role than men," said Nguyen Tuyet Mai, a former banker. "If you think of the family as a car, the shiny outside is the man, and the engine inside is the woman."
Ms. Mai, whose father is Vietnamese and whose mother was Russian, said the role of women here is not dictated by national laws or the Communist Party, but by deep-rooted cultural traditions. In this, she said, Vietnam is no different from China or other Asian countries.
In this country of fiercely independent women, Mrs. Clinton's trip was laden with symbolism. Because she attended the funeral of Leah Rabin, the widow of Yitzhak Rabin, the assassinated Israeli prime minister, Mrs. Clinton arrived in Hanoi half a day before her husband on her own Air Force plane.
While Mr. Clinton spoke to business people today, Mrs. Clinton tooled around Ho Chi Minh City, the former Saigon, in a separate motorcade.
Her speech at the Municipal Theater, a meticulously-restored French colonial building in the center of town, was promoted by her aides as a major event.
Like her husband, Mrs. Clinton alluded several times to their waning days in the White House. But while Mr. Clinton's comments have a wistful tone -- leavened with humor -- Mrs. Clinton sounds eager for a new platform.
Mrs. Clinton said she would miss the privilege as first lady to make historic trips. But she plans to use her position in the Senate to fight for the women's issues -- such as trafficking in people -- that she encountered here. "I will take with me the voices I heard in Vietnam," Mrs. Clinton said.

Vietnam's New Struggle: How Global to Become?

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam, Nov. 19

 BODY:
Bill Clinton took extra trouble 30 years ago to avoid showing up here for America's first conflict with Vietnam.
But in the final days of his presidency, with crowds cheering him on in Hanoi, and today in the city Americans will always call Saigon, Mr. Clinton threw himself into the middle of Vietnam's most immediate conflict: The battle within a divided government over how fast and how far to open the country to the capitalist, democratic forces that Vietnam's Communist leaders thought they had defeated. 
 The players and passions and the geopolitics are entirely different, of course, and America's stake in the outcome is vastly diminished. Yet throughout the president's visit -- as he plunged into crowds, debated Vietnam's conservative elite, and talked this morning with young entrepreneurs for whom the Ho Chi Minh Trail is a highway project -- everyone involved understood exactly what was going on.
Mr. Clinton was here chiefly to celebrate reconciliation. But it was reconciliation with an edge, because at every turn he argued that the Communist government in Hanoi could not overcome the forces of global economic integration the way it overcame the United States and its allies more than a quarter century ago. Vietnam's plans to flourish economically, he insisted, would only work if the country builds a fair legal system, allows free travel, embraces the Internet, and gradually opens its political system.
Clearly, many in the streets seemed to get the message, and some who disagreed came out to wave and cheer anyway. But Mr. Clinton left the country's leaders exactly where he found them: bickering, conflicted and wondering how they had won the war and lost the peace.
In a remarkable moment at the Communist Party headquarters in Hanoi late Saturday afternoon, Mr. Clinton plunged into a spirited exchange with the country's leading hard-liner, Le Kha Phieu, the Communist party chief and the most influential member of the Vietnamese leadership.
Mr. Phieu had watched President Clinton's nationally broadcast speech to students and seen the reception the President was getting on the streets, and clearly he was fed up. "We have seen the collapse of the U.S.S.R.," Mr. Phieu said of his country's former patron. And yet, he told the President, according to two American participants in the meeting, "we are still on our feet, we have reaffirmed Socialism." He went on to describe how Vietnam had begun to produce enough rice to feed itself and how it was determined to find its own way without surrendering its Socialist principals.
He argued that the economy could grow, even if it is divided into state sectors, private sectors and foreign sectors, with politically sensitive technologies still controlled by the government.
One of Mr. Clinton's top advisers, who witnessed the encounter, said his sense was that the Communist party chief was saying in effect: "There is a line. We kicked you guys out. And now we are going to be friendly but there is only so far we will go."
The two leaders argued, politely, over whether the United States had "imperialist" intentions here. Mr. Clinton told CNN today that "I stoutly disputed that we were an imperialist country" during the war, insisting that the conflict had been "over what self-determination for the Vietnamese people really meant."
They were talking about days long past. But the subtext of the discussion was very much about today, about Mr. Phieu's reluctance to let Vietnam plunge into a world and a marketplace dominated by American power.
Contrast that conversation with the one Mr. Clinton held this afternoon with Vo Viet Thahn, the closest thing Ho Chi Minh City has to a mayor, who came here as a North Vietnamese battalion commander helping to sieze Saigon in 1975.
"It was like night and day," said Samuel R. Berger, President Clinton's national secuirty adviser. "We could have been talking to any big-city mayor in the United States."
Mr. Thahn talked proudly about all the private sector jobs that have been created in this teeming city of motor scooters and smog, and how a 10 percent growth rate had brought the city's poverty level down. President Clinton asked what the United States might do to help.
"Low income housing projects," Mr. Thahn immediately suggested. That is a long, long way from Mr. Thahn's objective here 25 years ago, which was to wipe out any vestiges of American influence.
Indeed, the visceral attraction to America was the big surprise of this trip, reminiscent of Japan's fascination with all things American after World War II (the difference, of course, being that America won that war.)
While many Americans watching snippets of the visit on television were undoubtedly thinking about Bill Clinton's effort to sidestep the draft, the Vietnamese saw a man who had lifted the economic embargo against their counttry, normalized diplomatic relations and arrived here with a backup plane full of potential investors.
"The last American president we liked was Kennedy," said Do Thi La, a 47-year-old shopkeeper here, as she watched Mr. Clinton's motorcade speed past. "But Clinton may have done more good things for Vietnam."
There is an inevitable tendency during trips like this to overstate American influence, and to assume that just because the crowds were cheering, the outome of the newest Vietnam conflict is preordained. That would be dangerous.
The debate Mr. Clinton tripped upon in Vietnam closely parallels the one under way in China today. There, too, leaders are caught between the necessity of attracting global capital and the reality that openness will inevitably undercut their power. In both places, it's easier and easier to find great restaurants, and harder and harder to find commited Communists.
But it is also true that hard-liners like Mr. Phieu appear on the rise in Hanoi, at least for now. For all the talk about the power of globalization, most of Vietnam's 78 million people cannot afford a telephone and have never wandered into one of Saigon's chic Internet cafes. So at moments the optimistic talk among Mr. Clinton's aides about the inevitability of economic and political reform in Vietnam seemed like an eerie echo of the days when Robert McNamara, Mr. Kennedy's defense secretary, declared that "every quantitative measurement we have shows we are winning the war."
Maybe this time, the leaders in Hanoi have no real choice. They don't have many dominoes to play, they don't have allies willing to prop them up, and to the rest of the world it makes far less difference whether they succeed or fail. But as the author Ward Just wrote in a new forward this year to his 1967 book, "To What End," during the war, "No one knew the truth of things, whether the tide was in or out or where on the shore we stood."
He could have been writing about Vietnam today.

HEADLINE: Peru's President To Resign Soon, Top Aides Say

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, Nov. 19

 BODY:
Signaling the demise of one of Latin America's most authoritarian rulers, two top officials announced today that President Alberto K. Fujimori would resign by Tuesday, ending a tumultuous decade in power that saw him do battle with terrorists, drug traffickers and hyperinflation before succumbing to a series of scandals.
Second Vice President Ricardo Marquez, who until recently was a political unknown, said he was ready to take the reins of power until a new president could be elected in April and inaugurated on July 28. 
 "President Alberto Fujimori will present his resignation to Congress on Monday or Tuesday at the latest," Prime Minister Federico Salas said on a national radio network.
He stopped short of explaining why Mr. Fujimori, Latin America's second longest surviving leader, after Fidel Castro, was stepping down so suddenly, but he added, "What I know is that he does not want to be an obstacle to the process of democratization so that the next elections can be absolutely transparent."
There was no immediate word from Mr. Fujimori, who is visiting Japan, but the Peruvian Embassy in Tokyo issued a brief statement saying the president intended to resign within 48 hours. An embassy official who declined to be identified said nothing had been decided about Mr. Fujimori's plans for the future.
Peru's cabinet ministers presented their resignations to Prime Minister Salas, expressing indignation over the surprise announcement. But the three most senior members said they would continue carrying out their duties until a new transitional government is formed.
The announcements capped nine weeks in which his stature, once near invincible, has been in free fall. His move appeared to surprise the Clinton administration, which sent two senior officials to Lima to meet with government and opposition officials and discuss the next steps.
President Fujimori had gradually lost his grip on power since winning a third five-year term in May in an election that was widely perceived as tainted. The nose dive began in mid-September when a videotape leaked to a local cable television channel showed Mr. Fujimori's right-hand man, the intelligence chief Vladimiro Montesinos, apparently offering a $15,000 bribe to a congressman to switch parties.
The tape was the opening act in a gripping political drama: Mr. Fujimori attempted to save himself by dumping Mr. Montesinos, even over the opposition of military commanders, and promising that a new president would take office next July.
Next, Mr. Montesinos resigned and flew to Panama seeking asylum, but returned to Peru and went into hiding last month. Mr. Fujimori ordered the arrest of Mr. Montesinos, who is considered to know all Peru's best-kept secrets, and even led the manhunt. But the intelligence chief remains at large, as reports emerge of several foreign bank accounts in which Mr. Montesinos is said to have squirreled away at least $58 million.
In Washington, administration officials said Prime Minister Salas had telephoned the United States Ambassador to Peru, John R. Hamilton, to tell him that Mr. Fujimori would be staying in Japan indefinitely.
Following Mr. Salas's call, Arturo Valenzuela, the director for Latin American affairs on the National Security Council, and Peter Romero, the Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs, flew to Lima. The two men had been planning a trip even before today's developments, officials said.
It was not immediately clear whether Mr. Fujimori, a son of Japanese immigrants, would return to Peru or remain in Japan.
In Tokyo, a foreign ministry official said nothing had been decided about Mr. Fujimori's stay in the country, adding that there had been no request for asylum. Because Mr. Fujimori is of pure Japanese parentage, under Japanese law he is automatically eligible for citizenship.
In Mr. Fujimori's absence last week, various opposition parties took control of Congress and elected a centrist congressman, Valentin Paniagua, as the leader of Congress. Should the opposition decide to remove the little known Mr. Marquez from power before the elections, scheduled for April 8, Mr. Paniagua could take over as president.
Alejandro Toledo, who ran closely behind Mr. Fujimori in the first round of this year'selection before dropping out of the second round, saying it was unfair, said tonight that Mr. Marquez should not assume the presidency since "he was elected in the same fraudulent election."
Speaking from Madrid, Mr. Toledo suggested that Mr. Paniagua should lead a transition government.
Reaction by Peruvians to the news was muted. There were small, celebratory demonstrations in the cities of Lima, Trujillo and Iquitos. And in Arequipa, the second largest city and a center of anti-Fujimori activism, students splashed each other in spontaneous water fights.
Political analysts said that while Mr. Fujimori had seemed to sidestep the immediate threat posed by Mr. Montesinos's return to Peru, the president had been unable to contain a groundswell of opposition from political foes and ordinary Peruvians.
During the last few weeks, their anger was fed by one lurid news report after another: the seizure of Mr. Montesinos's bank accounts; a claim by the brother of Colombia's late drug kingpin, Pablo Escobar, that Mr. Escobar had secretly financed Mr. Fujimori's first election campaign; and the discovery of secret detention centers under Mr. Montesinos' former headquarters.
Should Mr. Fujimori come back to Lima, he could face an inquiry into his financial dealings from prosecutors already investigating Mr. Montesinos. They are looking into charges that Mr. Montesinos was involved in running guns to Colombian guerrillas, laundering money and directing death squads.
A former college professor, Mr. Fujimori, now 62, emerged from obscurity in 1990 to defeat the writer Mario Vargas Llosa and win the presidency.
Facing a growing security threat from two terrorist groups and unable to persuade Congress to enact his program, he suspended the legislature and the Supreme Court in 1992. He defied the United States and the Organization of American States by taking nearly dictatorial powers, but his move was broadly endorsed by the Peruvian people, who handed him a landslide election victory in 1995.
Even critics say Mr. Fujimori has accomplished much as president, virtually defeating the two terrorist groups, reducing inflation to single digits, making peace with Ecuador after several wars and significantly reducing both coca cultivation and trafficking in cocaine.
But his often high-handed style undercut the independence of the courts and Congress, and landed hundreds if not thousands of innocent people in prison.
Mr. Fujimori used much of his second term maneuvering to make way for a third term, which seemed not to be allowed by the Constitution. Controlling the new Congress and courts, Mr. Fujimori was able to get around this roadblock but a recession has eroded his popularity.
This year he relied on Mr. Montesinos to defeat a growing opposition, but many Peruvians found the manipulation of media and the electoral apparatus difficult to accept.
Prime Minister Salas said Mr. Fujimori had not ruled out running for Congress, which could give him immunity from prosecution. Mr. Fujimori has hinted that he would like to make a comeback and win back the presidency in the future.
Second Vice President Marquez, who replaced First Vice President Francisco Tudela after he resigned last month, said Mr. Fujimori had asked him to take power once his resignation took effect.

HEADLINE: The Count and the Map

 BODY:
Anyone who listened to the talk shows over the weekend could see that the representatives of Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush have turned at this point to repetition as the weapon of choice. Nothing has been left unsaid -- and said again -- about the familiar points of contention. One new development was the unusually high rejection rate for absentee ballots from Floridians living abroad, including many in the military. The Bush campaign was right to complain that almost 40 percent of these late-arriving ballots were disallowed in the final round of counting, and Senator Joseph Lieberman correctly asserted on NBC's "Meet the Press" that the "benefit of the doubt" should be given to military ballots from abroad. Common sense and the best available information indicate that many in the armed services were unable to get their ballots properly postmarked. The ballots ought to be analyzed according to the same principle that should govern recounts in Palm Beach, Broward and Dade Counties. That means every effort should be made to allow as many votes as possible under flawed circumstances.
Although the Bush campaign's stand on military ballots was proper, its renewed rhetorical assault aimed at depicting the hand recounts as a form of vote theft is irresponsible. The recounts, which should be allowed by the Florida Supreme Court, still represent the best way to settle the vote there. Governor Bush and his advisers probably made a mistake in not asking for a statewide hand count that would have included Republican counties, but that tactical error does not discredit a process that is endorsed by Florida and Texas law and is needed to bring the Florida contest to closure. The court hears arguments on the recount and related matters today and should rule as quickly as possible. 
 For the public, meanwhile, this waiting period provides an opportunity to return to the striking image of the nation's electoral map as it stood on the day after the election. Even with Florida as a question mark, that map showed Mr. Gore prevailing on both coasts and in most states around the Great Lakes, and Mr. Bush dominating the Sun Belt, the Plains and the Rockies. The immediate conclusion was that the election had revealed two Americas, one urban and industrial, the other suburban and rural. Some of the old party and demographic divisions did indeed resurface in this election.
But on closer inspection, the electoral map reveals an even more intriguing fault line, between states that went comfortably for one candidate and states that were nail-bitingly close. This reading produces a better gauge of the public's present political temperament and a clearer guide to where it wants the new president to take the country.
The first category -- places where a candidate won decisively -- consists of about 35 states. Mr. Gore won most of his coastal victories -- California, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut -- by big margins. Similarly, Mr. Bush's victories in the South, the Great Plains and the Rockies were blowouts. But battleground states -- like Pennsylvania, Michigan, Missouri, Wisconsin, Iowa, Ohio and (lest we forget) Florida -- were excruciatingly close or decided by two or three percentage points.
In short, this election produced three Americas -- one Republican, one Democratic and one that seems to seek a balance point in the broad middle ground. Though there were clear differences between the candidates on several important issues, it was not a campaign of sharp ideological combat. Both parties moved to the center -- first the Democrats and then, under Mr. Bush, the Republicans -- and both candidates ran from the center. That includes Mr. Gore, whose populist criticisms of corporations should not obscure the fact that he worked with Bill Clinton to put the Democrats in tune with the American majority. Mr. Bush, while appealing to a conservative base on economic issues, struck a decidedly moderate note on health care, prescription drug benefits and education.
There are those who say the election was close because America did not much like either candidate. A more positive interpretation is that America voted with enthusiasm, but with strings attached -- strings ensuring that neither man strayed too far from the middle. Whoever wins, of course, must deal with a capital full of angry partisans and a divided electorate. But the next president will not be without certain advantages. As Doris Kearns Goodwin said on "Meet the Press," the country is in the throes of a mechanical crisis, not a constitutional one. The nation's patchwork balloting system was not up to measuring such a close contest. Moreover, the next president will have a public-opinion foundation -- that being the balanced, mainly centrist sentiment in the battleground states of the electoral map's third America. It is a foundation, even in distempered times, from which to build.

HEADLINE: CLINTON IN VIETNAM: THE OVERVIEW;
Clinton Basks in the Adulation Of a City Once Called Saigon

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam, Nov. 19

 BODY:
President Clinton ended an emotional three-day visit to Vietnam today as he began it, pressing America's former foe -- gently but insistently -- to set aside its fears and join the global marketplace of trade and ideas.
"Imagine how much more you will achieve as even more young people gain more freedom to shape the decisions that affect their lives," he said. The key to the future, he repeated, is "entrepreneurship, innovation and competition" as well as "an open exchange of ideas." 
 Here in the former Saigon, as in Hanoi where his visit started, Mr. Clinton was surrounded by throngs of excited onlookers, many of whom had fought and lost alongside America against the victorious Communist north 25 years ago.
During his visit, he held talks with Vietnam's leaders, addressed the nation on television, honored America's missing soldiers and met business leaders and young people. But the most striking element of his visit was the fervor of the crowds on the streets.
"I love him!" cried Tran Thi Thu Huong, 31, a saleswoman, who waited like thousands of other people today for a glimpse of the American president. "He is so handsome."
It may have been this spontaneous enthusiasm -- something almost unheard-of here -- that prompted Le Kha Phieu, the Communist Party's general secretary, to issue a reminder that Vietnam had fought and sacrificed for its independence.
"Where did the cause of our resistance war against invaders come from?" he said in remarks published today. "Fundamentally it came because imperialists invaded to get colonies. Why did the United States bring its army to invade Vietnam when Vietnam did not bring an army to invade the United States?"
And it may have been the outpouring in Hanoi that caused authorities to surround Mr. Clinton's entourage here with even more police and to keep the crowds at a greater distance.
The dueling statements of the two leaders amounted to a public debate over the future here. It came four months after the two nations signed a trade agreement that, if carried out, will break down many of the protective walls Vietnam has erected around its economy and society.
The agreement, Mr. Clinton said, "will help to develop a more open, sophisticated free market, based on international rules of law." And, he said, "The changes it will bring should be embraced, not feared."
Mr. Phieu (pronounced few), a former general who often sounds a stern party line, retorted: "Our economy has many sectors, in which the state sector plays the leading role. We have a private economy but we do not privatize the economy."
He sounded irritated when he added, "We respect the choice, the life style and political systems of other nations. We in turn demand that other nations respect our people's choices."
Mr. Clinton risked the further irritation of his hosts today when he demonstrated America's concern over religious freedom with a brief, unannounced visit to Pham Minh Man, the city's Roman Catholic archbishop. About 10 percent of the population is Catholic and while religious worship is permitted, churches of all faiths must submit to government regulation.
Free choice was a central theme of Mr. Clinton's visit as he urged Vietnam to unfetter the energy and creativity of its people, particularly its youth.
He made a point of meeting with young people in a round-table setting. They are representatives of what seemed to be the main audience for the message he brought to Vietnam.
"Your best days clearly lie ahead, as you continue to find the means to release the skills and the ingenuity of your people," he told a separate group of Vietnamese and foreign business leaders.
As he had noted when he spoke to university students in a nationally televised address in Hanoi, Mr. Clinton pointed to the success of the one million ethnic Vietnamese who now live in the United States -- an object lesson in what can be achieved in a free society.
He made his remarks at a container terminal at the port, standing in front of a huge gantry bearing the giant letters "Safety First" -- a phrase that could be the motto of the country's leadership as it experiments gingerly with economic reforms.
The subtext of the public exchange between the two leaders was the subversive effects of a free market on a controlled socialist society -- something the Chinese and the Vietnamese call "peaceful evolution."
Both sides generally agree on the effects of this process. Today, it is not troops the United States is bringing to Vietnam but a free market, and the concern of leaders like Mr. Phieu is that the greater the influence of the market here, the more their own power will diminish.
One of the riskiest and most crucial decisions the leadership will have to make is whether to open up its telecommunications and information industries, many analysts say.
"Right now, one-tenth of 1 percent are on the Internet; by 2005, the projection is still that there will be less than 1 percent," said Gene Sperling, the White House economic policy adviser. The price of being on the Internet for an hour is $3, he said, in a nation where the per capita income for a week is $6.
When one of the participants at the youth round table told Mr. Clinton that 300,000 Vietnamese are registered to use the Internet, Mr. Clinton responded, "Three hundred thousand sounds like a lot of people, but you have 78 million people in Vietnam."
Another participant, Tran Truong Son, 32, a Communist Party member who runs a spare-parts company, raised a common concern here over the dangers of uncontrolled freedom.
Mr. Clinton seized the opportunity to engage in the kind of intellectual give-and-take that he loves and that he is urging on the Vietnamese people.
"One of the great debates every society must have is how to balance individual freedoms with the need for cohesion of families, communities and nations," he said, acknowledging that this is an area in which the United States has had problems. "You can't exercise freedom without responsibility."
Pressing the need for a boom in information technology, Mr. Clinton told the young people they should work to have a computer in every village and a cell phone in every business.
Modest as that may seem, it is a distant goal for Vietnam.
Martti Ranin, the representative in Vietnam for Nokia of Finland, the leading mobile-phone manufacturer, said that only seven-tenths of 1 percent of Vietnamese have cell phones. He noted that 72 percent of these are here in Ho Chi Minh City, the country's business hub.
Mr. Ranin was one of the business leaders who attended Mr. Clinton's speech at the container terminal. Though it is mostly symbolic, he said, the president's trip to Vietnam is significant because "it tells us that this is a safe country to invest in."
After Mr. Clinton lifted a postwar trade embargo against Vietnam in 1994 -- and opened full diplomatic relations the next year -- many foreign businessmen rushed in, sensing a big future in this vigorous, highly educated but underdeveloped nation.
But the doubts of the leadership along with a morass of red tape, corruption and capricious rules, caused many investors to pull out. The economy soured and growth fell.
Most businessmen here say they believe that an open market is inevitable and that Mr. Clinton's vision for the future is a more likely scenario than that of Mr. Phieu.
"It could be faster than it is," Mr. Ranin said. "Everybody is waiting for a faster pace. But they are going in the right direction, no question about that."
And so Mr. Clinton's visit has brought a burst of enthusiasm not only to the crowds on the streets but also to the foreign free-marketeers who are waiting for the boom times to come.
When he plunged into the crowd of business leaders at the container terminal, Mr. Clinton was greeted with the same enthusiasm he found in the crowds on the streets.
"I just reached up and he grabbed my hand," Mr. Ranin said happily, sounding very much like the onlookers who greeted the president in both Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. "He has a very firm handshake, and not sweaty at all, even though this weather is so hot."

HEADLINE: As a Tragedy Is Revisited, A Sisterhood Is Forged;
Survivors of Pan Am Flight 103 Victims Wait And View From Afar a Trial on the Bombing

BYLINE: By LAURA MANSNERUS

 BODY:
Since May, a handful of women have been meeting regularly over cafeteria lunches at the Jacob K. Javits Federal Building downtown, like relatives brought together with a sad purpose at a hospital. Lunch is the break in each day of watching the trial of the two men accused of killing their husbands and children.
They have been together since Dec. 21, 1988, when Pan Am Flight 103 exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people. "We've been waiting for a trial for 12 years," said Joan Dater, whose 20-year-old daughter, Gretchen, was on the plane. "The truth has been denied to us for all these years." 
 They are nervous about the case, which is unfolding in a court in the Netherlands, and is being relayed by closed-circuit television in a viewing room in the federal building that is open only to them.
After hundreds of witnesses, the prosecutors, barristers for the Scottish government, are expected to rest their case this week. Many of the American passengers' hundreds of family members say they are gratified by the workings of justice. But they are also facing the possibility that the guilty -- whom the prosecution say are two Libyan agents and the defense says is a web of other Palestinian terrorists -- will go unpunished. Or worse, they fear, the story lines so laboriously strung together by investigators could come undone and leave no explanation at all.
Many of the passengers' family members who are closely watching the trial are getting by in the same way they have for 12 years since their loved ones died: by banding together.
The families gather to watch in Manhattan and Washington, at sites set up by the Justice Department and the Scottish courts. They are the only people allowed to see the trial in the United States. For the half-dozen or so who go to the federal buidling as often as their schedule allows -- sometimes daily -- it has become almost a vocation.
They have watched as prosecutors have argued that two Libyan agents sent a suitcase with explosives from Malta to Frankfurt to London, and from there to Pan Am Flight 103, bound for New York, while the defense has sought to link the bombing to a Palestinian group and a terrorist in prison in Sweden.
The trial has caused the families intense disappointment -- a witness who was supposed to have seen the defendants with the suitcase could not testify that he had. But it has also renewed hope, with evidence that one defendant bought clothing that was packed with the bomb.
Most of those who meet to watch are placing their confidence in the prosecution, even though it has not produced a witness who saw the defendants with the brown Samsonite bag at the Malta airport.
"The circumstantial evidence is overwhelming," Mrs. Dater said. Helen Engelhardt, whose husband, Tony Hawkins, was killed, is less certain. "I just want the truth to come out," she said after one morning's testimony meant to implicate Palestinian terrorists arrested in Germany. "If they draw that connection, fine."
The discussion never stops among the faithful who travel from from Uptown and New Jersey and Brooklyn. The other day Dr. Lestra Benello, a retired internist who lost her 24-year-old son, Julian, drove five hours from Hanover, N.H.
At a cafeteria table for four, Mrs. Dater, who lives in Ramsey, N.J., began: "One of the things we've learned through the six and a half months we've been here ----" and stopped when she heard a gasp.
Jane Davis, who has a house in Connecticut and rented an apartment in Manhattan for the trial, had gasped at the words "six and half months." She looked at Kathy Daniels Tedeschi, who takes the train in from Belle Mead, N.J., and the two broke out into laughter, amazed that so much time had gone by. They have been close friends for years.
Some moments are much harder. Mrs. Dater could not keep a tear from sliding down her cheek as she said: "I feel very strongly I'm standing in for Gretchen. She's saying, 'Mom, what happened to me?' "
After Friday's testimony, Mrs. Davis and Ms. Engelhardt, who is from Flatbush, Brooklyn, said they were still a bit shaken by the evidence presented that morning: bomb-making equipment and a radio cassette recorder of the kind that was packed with explosives and put aboard Flight 103.
Those gathering for the trial say they are unsettled by looking at the faces of the accused, Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al-Megrahi and Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah. Last week they saw Mohamed Abo Talb, who the defense says was part of a Palestinian terrorist group that caused the bombing, brought from Swedish prison. He said that he had known nothing of the Lockerbie bombing, but acknowledged other attacks.
"What's he like?" Mrs. Dater asked. "This is something that's been on my mind for 12 years. What kind of people are these? How do they think?"
Ms. Engelhardt said the political intrigue surrounding the bombing meant that "none of this is normal grieving."
The families sometimes think they are the only ones paying attention to the trial in a nation whose interest in international affairs, even in terrorist atrocities, has waned.
At the table, Mrs. Tedeschi said, nodding to the other women, "we can talk to someone on our own level."
Reporters are not allowed to see the televised proceedings, though they are admitted to the court at Camp Zeist. Scottish law does not permit the trial participants to talk to journalists.
Whether for lack of headlines or faded memories or because of urgings to put the loss behind them, many friends and even relatives are blurry on Pan Am Flight 103.
"Most people have a low tolerance for other people's suffering," said Kathryn M. Turman, the director of the Office for Victims of Crime in the Justice Department, which has given the families money to travel to the Netherlands and has set up a Web site for them. "They say it's time to move on. That's not the way this kind of grief and loss works."
Frank Duggan, a Washington lawyer and former member of the presidential commission on airline security that was started after the crash, said: "There have been other tragedies since that time, but there's something about Pan Am 103 that sticks in people's minds. Partly it's the enormity of the situation, but more than that, it hasn't ended."
It is perhaps no surprise that the women have been uniting to hear the testimony and help one another through the trial. From the beginning, many of the families have been well organized and active. The Victims of Pan Am Flight 103, a group formed within weeks of the crash, lobbied furiously for the Aviation Security Improvement Act of 1990, which, among other things, required United States carriers to provide the State Department complete passenger lists on international flights that crash outside the country, and to match up every bag on an international flight with a passenger before a plane may take off.
And while the families of the 189 American victims were divided over strategy and goals, they pressed for more legislation, for memorials at Arlington National Cemetery and in Scotland, for United Nations action to force the Libyan leader Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, to give up the two defendants and for sanctions against his government.
"They literally changed U.S. laws," Mr. Duggan said. "They've had four U.N. resolutions passed. They've changed the regulatory processes of the airlines."
The Victims of Pan Am 103 has three meetings a year and sends out a newsletter after each one. It has a Web site, in addition to a secure site set up by the Justice Department and the Syracuse University Law School, which provides transcripts from the trial. Thirty-five students from Syracuse University were killed on the flight.
Ms. Engelhardt, who edits the newsletter, said that many families around the country had retreated, but that "this trial is bringing people out of the woodwork."
And so the discussion went at the lunch table. Intertwined were exchanges about the latest events in their lives, which have taken enormous turns in 12 years.
Mrs. Dater, whose husband, Tom, publishes a newspaper in Ramsey, used to teach journalism at William Paterson University but never returned after the crash, she said, because she could not face a classroom full of students the same age as the daughter she lost. Mrs. Davis was a history teacher in Connecticut, but she, too, quit teaching after her daughter Shannon, 19, was killed.
They recalled the winter of 1989, when, foggy with grief, they first met. Kathy Tedeschi was Kathy Daniels, widow of William Daniels, when she met Mrs. Davis at a mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral.
The non-Catholic Mrs. Daniels sheepishly remembered taking communion -- "we didn't know we weren't supposed to" -- and the Catholic Mrs. Dater, assured her, "We told you it was all right."
Babette Hollister of Manhattan, a semi-retired economics professor who lost her 20-year-old daughter, Katherine, said cautiously, "I feel like an outsider; I don't get involved in all this."
The others explained that Ms. Hollister's husband died a few years ago and that earlier years she had been active in the New York group.
Later, in the hallway, Mrs. Davis said quietly, "We've grown accustomed to each other."

HEADLINE: Bosnian Election Returns Point to Little Change, Analysts Say

BYLINE: By CARLOTTA GALL 

DATELINE: SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Nov. 15

 BODY:
Five years after the Dayton peace accords ended the war in Bosnia, its neighbors have turned decisively toward democracy. But Bosnia has failed to make the leap, says Wolfgang Petritsch, the Austrian diplomat who effectively runs this deeply scarred Balkan land for the foreigners who bankroll it.
As returns from the general elections held on Nov. 11 filter in, local and foreign officials here are struggling to predict what they mean. What is clear is that international officials are disappointed and the country is not set for major change. 
 The nationalist parties have remained strong, but moderates may have enough votes to form governments in the two entities that make up Bosnia, the Muslim-Croat Federation and the Bosnian Serb Republic.
The results are mixed and promise a future of power sharing and haggling that spell further ineffectual government and continued obstruction from nationalists of efforts at unifying the country, analysts said.
"Had there been a clear mandate in favor of the moderates, you could have hoped things would move faster," said Michael Balagus, director of the National Democratic Institute's program in Bosnia. "It's going to be slow, and will continue to be painful and muddled." His group is an American nonprofit organization that promotes democracy.
 On Sunday, with 97 percent of the vote counted, the nationalist Serbian Democratic Party emerged the strongest party in all of the elections in the Bosnian Serb Republic -- for the presidency and for seats in the legislatures of the republic and of Bosnia as a whole -- although moderates retain considerable power in the Bosnian Serb Parliament.
 In the Muslim-Croat Federation the picture was more splintered, with the multiethnic Social Democratic Party gaining 27 percent of votes, roughly equal to the Muslim nationalist party, the Party for Democratic Action, and ahead of the Croatian Democratic Union, which dominated the Bosnian Croat community and won 19 percent of the federation's overall vote.
Mr. Petritsch said the fear and threats that have marked nationalist politics here since the old Yugoslav federation began to break apart in 1990 would further isolate Bosnia just as neighboring Yugoslavia and Croatia were abandoning such policies. "Yugoslavia is on the way to becoming a democratic, European, integrated country," he said. I do not want Bosnia to fall behind."
On the day after the election, Mr. Petritsch, the head of Bosnia's international administration, signaling foreign determination to force change, made a big play of bringing in six new laws, creating a nationwide court and economic and trade reforms. The laws, essential if Bosnia is to be integrated with Europe, were blocked by the previous legislature for months, Mr. Petritsch said.
"Politics here is too slow, too inefficient," he said. "It has not achieved what the country and the people need."
It is a familiar cry from the foreign administrators and diplomats in Bosnia, who criticize the nationalists not just just for their obstructionism, but also for their tight control of the country's limited economic assets.
Yet many of the voters in Bosnia, still fearful of the perceived threat from enemies in the 1992-95 war, came out in support for their respective nationalist parties. The message was "if you don't vote for us, no one will take care of you," said the American ambassador to Bosnia, Thomas Miller.
Luke Zahner, spokesman of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which organized the elections, said, "The nationalists were successful in their campaign message."
The Croatian and Muslim parties led a combined attack against the moderates in the Muslim-Croat Federation, he said. The Croats also organized their own referendum on the same day, which was ruled illegal but helped get the vote out.
But Ambassador Miller noted a shift since 1996, when the main Muslim, Serbian and Croatian parties still commanded more than 70 percent of the vote in their areas. Now, none have a majority in any assembly.
In the Muslim-Croat Federation, the multiethnic Social Democratic Party hopes to join forces with the Party for Bosnia and Herzegovina, led by former Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic, and other small parties to form a government. That would exclude the Muslim and Croatian nationalist parties for the first time since Dayton.
In the Bosnian Serb Republic, the Serbian nationalist party founded by Radovan Karadzic may be unable to form a government.
The search for optimism in small details has come to mark the international effort to bring change to Bosnia, where key steps laid down in the Dayton accords have yet to be taken -- above all, the return of almost two million people, most of them Muslims driven out by Serbs, to their homes.
"The fact that 1.7 million people remain outside their homes tells you everything," said Mr. Silajdzic, who was a Muslim negotiator in Dayton. "This is not Dayton. If it was Dayton, at least one-third of the people would have returned. In fact we still have the results of genocide going on here."
The arrest of indicted war crimes suspects -- prime among them Dr. Karadzic, still believed to be in hiding in Bosnia, but also dozens of less prominent men -- is another glaring failure of foreign and local forces.
A recent report by the International Crisis Group, a private group that monitors affairs in Bosnia, names 17 police officers and 11 elected officials working today in the Bosnian Serb Republic "who may be implicated in war crimes," and raises serious questions about 75 individuals.
Not one war crimines suspect has been arrested by local Bosnian Serb police, although they are bound by the Dayton agreement to do so.
Mr. Petritsch urged most strongly that before it leaves office, the Clinton administration should help capture Dr. Karadzic and other prime suspects.
"We now have a window of opportunity," Mr, Petrisch saod, "until the end of the year when a new administration is elected, for governments to decide whether this is not the time to act. It might never be done otherwise, and it would aid the reconciliation process."

Arafat's 'War Process'

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
When the leader of the Hezbollah in Syrian-occupied Lebanon came up with a plan to kidnap three Israeli soldiers six weeks ago, his Iranian sponsors cautioned him to first get the approval of Bashar al-Assad, the new president of Syria.
That's because Israel was expected to retaliate against Hezbollah forces in areas controlled by Syrian troops. Ever since Israel pulled its troops out of its Lebanese buffer zone, Hezbollah's terrorism has been closely coordinated with Bashar in Damascus. 
 Usually reliable intelligence sources note that the inexperienced Bashar, eager to establish credentials in the Arab world as a militant enemy of Israel, gave his approval to the kidnap plan. This despite the danger that the Hezbollah's capture of Israeli soldiers could lead to armed confrontation in Lebanon between Syrian and Israeli forces.
On or about Oct. 8, Hassan Nasrallah, secretary general of Hezbollah, reported directly to President Bashar that the kidnapping had been carried out as planned. Bashar was heard to have congratulated him on its "smooth execution," goes the undercover account, and assured the terrorist leader full backing against anticipated mild U.N. reaction as well as a stronger response from Israel.
The risk accepted by Arab and Persian leaders in a daring provocation within what Israel considers its territory was evidence of what is emerging as Yasir Arafat's strategy.
From his turnabout that so surprised President Clinton at the Camp David fiasco, to his reluctance to speak out to restrain the rioting of Palestinians and sniping of his gunmen-police, his plan can be deduced:
First step is to transform the "peace process," which was in danger of succeeding in establishing a small Palestinian state, into a religious "war process" for control of Jerusalem and a state incorporating Jordan and Israel. What keeps Arafat in power is not the dubious economic promise of a struggling dictatorship but his militant followers' dream of driving the Jews out of the Middle East.
Second step is to whip up support in world opinion by creating innocent victims of Israeli guns. Palestinian snipers draw fire into civilian crowds for the sole purpose of sacrificing innocents, creating anguished funeral demonstrations and spreading hatred. Every casualty is exploitable; every picture of a boy with a slingshot rather than a gun is a small victory; the gut-wrenching film of the boy dying in a crossfire was a propaganda triumph.
Though such a war process does not win military victory, it delivers results: in a much less well-armed form of intifada a few years ago, it led to Oslo and ultimately to Ehud Barak's stunning concessions. But to attain a goal of stimulating the defeat of Israel by Arab armies far stronger than his own, Arafat needs more than sustained low-level belligerency that wears down the Israeli will; he needs to provoke a new Middle East war.
That explains the campaign to sacrifice Palestinian women and children, opening the possibility for a stray Israeli shell to inflict horrific tragedy. Infuriated Muslims throughout the region then put pressure on shaky sheiks to support another such war.
That's why we see Arafat's allies in the Hezbollah enticing Syria's strongman into taking risks his dictator-father Hafez -- having learned a bloody lesson that cost him the Golan -- would have avoided. Arafat also knows that Iraq's Saddam Hussein, developing weaponry to counter Israel's nuclear deterrent, is spoiling to send his tanks and Scuds through Jordan into his enemy's homeland.
The possibility of such a Palestinian-sparked conflagration must be foremost in Barak's mind as he deals with the rioting and kidnapping. He must respond with seeming toughness, lest Israelis scorn him for being weak; yet he must not use too much firepower, lest he fall into Arafat's wider-war trap.
Barak's demonstrated dovishness may force him to err on the side of using ever-greater force and thereby be drawn into Arafat's war process. The paradox is that the Israeli opposition leader Arik Sharon's longtime reputation for fierceness would enable the Likud leader to enforce separation, control military escalation and stop that war process.
America's mind is fixed on its own affairs, but thanks to Arafat, whoever wins the White House is sure to have a stressful first 100 days.

Peru's President Is Ready To Step Down, Aides Say
Two top officials in Peru announced that President Alberto K. Fujimori would resign by Tuesday, ending a decade in power in which he battled terrorists, drug traffickers and hyperinflation before succumbing to a series of scandals. There was no immediate word from Mr. Fujimori, who is visiting Japan. A1 

Clintons End Vietnam Visit
President Clinton ended an emotional three-day visit to Vietnam as he began it, pressing America's former foe -- gently but insistently -- to set aside its fears and join the global marketplace of trade and ideas. Mr. Clinton's remarks came four months after the two nations signed a trade agreement that, if carried out, would break down many of the protective walls Vietnam has erected around its economy and society. A1
 
Hillary Rodham Clinton, not yet a senator and not quite a former first lady, brought her trademark mixture of feminism and family values to Vietnam, telling an audience made up largely of women that "anything we do to help women helps children and families and society." Mrs. Clinton paid homage to the exalted place women occupy in Vietnamese history as well as their central role in the country's commercial life. A12
 
Israeli Shot in Jordan
An Israeli diplomat was shot outside his home in Jordan, raising fresh concerns that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is affecting neighboring countries that have already made peace with Israel. A3
 
Nationalist Sentiment in Bosnia
Results from Nov. 11 elections in Bosnia are mixed and moderates lack the clear mandate that international officials had hoped for, promising a future of power sharing and haggling that spell more ineffectual government and continued obstruction from nationalists on unifying the country, analysts said.

Immigration Debate in Germany
Kosovo Albanians admitted to Germany because of persecution and a war are being expelled at a brisk rate now that the war is over, raising questions about immigration in Germany, the European country with the largest population and the largest number of foreigners. A10
 
Hopeful Step for Kashmir
The Indian government announced that it would unilaterally stop military operations in the troubled region of Kashmir during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which begins later this month, a move that may be a hopeful step toward ending more than a decade of violence in Kashmir. A10
 
More Power for Yemen Leader
Yemen's Parliament, which is dominated by the General People's Congress of President Ali Abdullah Saleh, agreed to extend the term of president from five to seven years and that of its own members from four to six years. The constitutional amendments also give the president the right to dissolve Parliament and call for general elections. (AP)

Election Fight Continues In Court and Recount Halls
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the Democratic candidate for vice president, said Florida election officials should reconsider their rejection of hundreds of military ballots from overseas, even if they might not comply with the law, a retreat from the position the Democrats had taken since Friday. A1
 
Lawyers for Gov. George W. Bush contended that Florida law set a clear deadline of last Tuesday for counties to submit all vote tallies except overseas absentee ballots, and they asked the Florida Supreme Court to let the state reject any manual recounts done after that date. A1
 
Election workers in two Florida counties resumed the laborious manual recounts that in recent days have been slowed by fatigue, partisan disputes and -- in one county -- another change in the definition of a vote. A1
 
Despite sharp differences on many important issues, Democrats and Republicans in Florida more often than not found ways to work together. But in the last 12 days, this carefully cultivated tradition has been sorely tested, residents and political leaders said. A15
 
Perhaps it was inevitable that bizarre charges would emerge from the biosphere-like counting room where hundreds of people have been hunched over tables counting votes in Broward County under the glare of the nation. But some accusations are just plain wacky. A15

HEADLINE: Sudden Fame on a Quest for Freedom;
A Nobel Prize, Not Politics, Shakes Up the World of a Storyteller in Exile

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING

DATELINE: PARIS, Nov. 20

 BODY:
Until Gao Xingjian exhibited his ink paintings at a local cultural center this spring, his working-class neighbors in the Paris suburb of Bagnolet had no idea they had an artist in their midst. He was simply the polite Chinese immigrant who lived on the 18th floor of their run-down housing project. Only after the show did he become something of a celebrity, at least to those riding the elevator with him.
What his neighbors still did not know was that Mr. Gao was also a writer. Until Oct. 12, that is, when their building was invaded by reporters and television crews, Mr. Gao's face appeared on the nightly news and his name circled the world. He had won the 2000 Nobel Prize in Literature, and his neighbors were thrilled. They put up a sign in the building's drab lobby proclaiming it home to a Nobel laureate and began organizing a party to celebrate. 
 Elsewhere in France and beyond, however, a more common response to his selection was, who? Mr. Gao has 18 plays, 4 works of literary criticism and 5 books of fiction to his name, but his entire oeuvre has been banned on the Chinese mainland since 1985, while his best-known novel, "Soul Mountain," a lyrical account of a long journey through the Chinese backlands, has so far been published only in Taiwan, Sweden, France and Australia.
Little wonder that Mr. Gao (whose name is pronounced gow shing-jen), a slightly built man with a wry sense of humor who looks a decade younger than his 60 years, was himself taken aback by his award (which carries a prize of just over $900,000). Since taking up exile here in 1987, he has lived off paintings, not writing.
"My only reaction was, 'Can this be true?' " he said, recalling the telephone call from the secretary of the Swedish Academy. "He said: 'Yes, it's true. And you have to make a speech, with a written text, for 45 minutes.' 'That's very long,' I said. Then almost immediately the doorbell rang, and there was a crowd of journalists. Since then it has been a storm. You can't imagine. If I plug in the phone, it rings. It's like a dripping tap you can't turn off."
Still, the Nobel effect on his publishing career was immediate. French sales of "Soul Mountain," just 6,000 in the five years preceding his Nobel Prize, have now reached 45,000. HarperCollins, which had published the book in Australia, is bringing it out in the United States next week in a translation by Mabel Lee. Foreign rights for this and his second novel, "One Man's Bible," an often bitter semi-autobiographical account of China's Cultural Revolution, have been sold in several countries.
Of more immediate concern to Mr. Gao, though, is his address to the Swedish Academy on Dec. 7, three days before the Nobel awards ceremony. "It's very important," he said, "more important than the prize itself, because I have the chance to make a speech to the entire world. I have to give a message as a writer. The title will be: 'The Raison d'Etre of Literature.' "
That he has chosen not to talk about politics should please China's cultural authorities, who were angered that the country's first Nobel literature laureate should be a political exile. Yet Mr. Gao is not fleeing political controversy. Politics may have disrupted his life, but he was never an activist: his battles in China were always about literature; the "crime" that drove him out in 1987 was that his work reflected, not socialist realism, but Western literary freedom.
Mr. Gao's interest in Western culture dates back to his childhood in Nanjing in eastern China. His mother, a member of a Y.M.C.A. theater troupe before the Communist Revolution, was an avid reader of Western literature. "Thanks to her, we had lots of books everywhere, translations of classics, Balzac, Zola, Steinbeck," Mr. Gao recalled during a recent interview in French at a friend's home in Paris. "That's why I began to read at a very early age."
"I always had the dream of being a writer or painter or actor or playwright," he went on. "My mother and I would do little theater pieces at home. Sometimes my father was the only audience. I wrote my first novel when I was 10. It was an adventure story. At the same time, I painted. Early on, I was doing oils, water colors, calligraphy -- all sorts of things."
His mother discouraged him from entering the National Academy of Fine Arts, so instead he studied French in Beijing. And once fluent in the language, he had access to more experimental Western literature, including plays by Ionesco, Beckett, Genet and Artaud. To his astonishment, he also found that political documents banned in China were often available in French, among them Khrushchev's famous -- and secret -- denunciation of Stalin in 1956.
Chinese politics, however, posed a more direct problem. During the disastrous economic program known as the Great Leap Forward in the early 1960's, Mr. Gao's mother was sent to the countryside, where she drowned in an accident. He, too, was forced into farm labor, although by now he was also writing prolifically, albeit for himself.
"Don't send this to a publisher or a review," an older writer friend warned him. "You're too young. You don't know the dangers of writing."
Even research into literary form, he learned, could be a political crime. "Every written text in China had to include a eulogy to the Communist Party," he remembered, "even if you were writing children's short stories or teenage things about sadness or growing up. Everything was politicized."
Then, when the Cultural Revolution began in 1966, fearing imprisonment, Mr. Gao destroyed everything he had written.
More than a decade passed before China's intellectuals dared stir anew. Mr. Gao tested the waters in 1981 with a book of essays, "A Preliminary Discussion of the Art of Modern Fiction," which set off a debate about modernism and realism. He also resumed writing plays and joined the People's Art Theater in Beijing.
"The first play I wrote after the Cultural Revolution was 'Bus Stop,' but the theater said it was too avant-garde to put on at the time," he said of a play strongly evocative of Beckett's "Waiting for Godot." "So I wrote another play, 'Warning Signal,' which was presented first in 1982. It caused a polemic, but was not banned. Then 'Bus Stop' was presented in 1983, and I was attacked for spiritual pollution. I was ordered to make a public self-criticism and refused. Instead, I disappeared."
The voyage through southwestern China that followed eventually provided much of the material for "Soul Mountain," although he had begun the book before fleeing Beijing.
"I said to myself, 'I have already subjected myself to self-censorship, and still I was attacked,' " he recalled. "So I started writing a novel just for myself without thinking of having it published."
Five months later he returned to Beijing. He presented a new play, "Wild Man," at the People's Art Theater in 1985, but then the political mood changed again, and he could no longer be published. "The fight against spiritual pollution was not really against me, but against reformists in the Communist Party," he explained. "The writer was simply a symbol for warning others."
Mr. Gao began thinking of leaving China. He made one trip to Europe with a group of writers in 1985, then two years later, although on the blacklist as a writer, he was allowed to travel abroad as a painter. Convinced that the situation in China would deteriorate, he settled in Paris. Then, after the killing of demonstrators in Tiananmen Square in 1989, he resigned from the Chinese Communist Party and obtained refugee status in France. (He acquired French citizenship in 1998.)
His first task as an exile was to complete "Soul Mountain," which was published in Taiwan in 1990. The novel, which the Swedish Academy called "an odyssey in time and space through the Chinese countryside," is remarkable not only for its magical tales, folkloric roots and eroticism but also for its patchwork of narrative styles, from poems and monologues to ballads and conversations.
"A writer has to find his own language," he said. "But my language is not a style for me. In 'Soul Mountain' you find all genres of literary writing. It is a research into style. But it is the language that counts, the joy of plunging into a language and finding a thread. It's what I call the flow of language. You have to respect this linear journey. Even if you change the pronouns -- I, you, he -- a novel is still like a long monologue."
Even before "Soul Mountain" Mr. Gao's work had been noticed in Europe. Noel Dutrait, a French scholar, sought out Mr. Gao in Beijing in the early 1980's and began studying his plays. When "Soul Mountain" was completed, Mr. Dutrait and his wife, Liliane, set about translating it. Considered too long by major French publishers, it was brought out in its full 670 pages by a smaller French house, Editions L'Aube, in 1995. "The Other Shore," a collection of five of his plays, was published in English last year by the Chinese University Press of Hong Kong. It is distributed in the United States by the University of Michigan Press.
It was an admirer from Sweden who paved the way for the Nobel Prize. Goran Malmqvist, a China expert at the University of Stockholm, had also traveled to Beijing in the mid-80's to meet Mr. Gao. As it happens, Mr. Gao could not be found, but he later sent several of his plays to Mr. Malmqvist, who translated them and had them produced in Stockholm. Only in 1987 did Mr. Gao finally meet his Swedish champion, who has continued to translate his works, including "Soul Mountain."
Thanks to Mr. Malmqvist, then, Swedish readers and theatergoers (as well as members of the Swedish Academy) can read Mr. Gao in their own language. And it could only have helped Mr. Gao's candidacy that Mr. Malmqvist is one of 18 academy members who make the final selection of Nobel laureates. Since Oct. 12, Mr. Gao's fortuitous connection to the academy has prompted some Swedish newspapers to raise questions about conflict of interest, although Mr. Malmqvist has indignantly waved away any suggestion of impropriety.
Mr. Gao himself seems unperturbed. He said he felt lucky to have had friends around the world willing to promote his work when he was unknown. In 1997, for instance, Chinese friends in New York arranged for his play "Between Life and Death" to be presented in English at the Theater of the New City and his paintings to be shown at the Schimmel Center for the Arts. But he feels even luckier to be living outside China.
"I am not sad to be in exile," he said. "It has been a renaissance for me. I have been able to live off my paintings, and I have the luxury of writing what I want. I have many friends. Writing is a solitary business, but I am not alone."

HEADLINE: Sony Plans a Tracking Stock For Its Internet Service Unit

BYLINE: By MIKI TANIKAWA

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 20

 BODY:
The Sony Corporation said today that it was preparing to offer a tracking stock to investors to highlight the corporate value of its wholly owned Internet service provider, the Sony Communication Network Corporation.
The move will make Sony the first Japanese company to issue a tracking stock, and it is intended to permit Sony to raise funds for its entire consumer electronics and media group while keeping a firm grip on its fast-growing Internet business. 
 "We think that this will reveal the corporate value of the subsidiary while raising the shareholder value of the group," Sony's chief executive, Nobuyuki Idei, said at a news conference.
Before Sony can issue a tracking stock, however, shareholders must approve the plan at an extraordinary meeting next January. In addition, the Tokyo Stock Exchange and the government must revise their regulations to allow such shares. Tracking stocks are currently not authorized in Japan, but Sony officials said they were confident that the government would make the rules changes necessary for its plan
A tracking stock would let investors value Sony's Internet service provider, So-net, separately from the rest of the company, which has had a decline of 44 percent in its share value this year. Investors in the tracking stock would not, however, own a share of the subsidiary, as they would with a conventional stock; Sony will continue to own the business.
Several American companies have used tracking stocks to tap investor interest in technology stocks. AT&T issued one for its AT&T wireless unit, for example, and General Motors did the same for its Hughes Electronics subsidiary.
Under Sony's proposal, owners of the tracking stock are entitled to the same dividend that Sony Communication Network pays to its parent and to the same voting rights that accrue to shareholders of the parent company. But the investors have no direct claim on the assets of the Internet company should the parent company fall into a financial crisis.
The Internet subsidiary, which says it has 1.47 million subscribers, is strategically significant to Sony, executives said, so the company elected to offer stock without ceding management control to outside investors.
The announcement did nothing to reverse the slide in Sony's stock. In Tokyo trading, Sony shares fell 1.3 percent, to close at a 52-week low of 8,120 yen, or about $73.69.
Some critics said that the tracking stock would not necessarily help the existing shareholders because it might divide the market for Sony stock, making it more difficult to trade existing shares.
Investors who own Sony stock because they are interested in the Internet business do not need to hold the parent stock anymore, said Masaaki Abe, chief investment officer of Pictet Asset Management (Japan) Ltd. As an investor, he said, "it would be financially inefficient to hold both stocks."

HEADLINE: Shunyi Journal;
Blinded by Poverty: The Dark Side of Capitalism

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

DATELINE: SHUNYI, China

 BODY:
In 15 minutes, Dr. Jiang Lijuan broke up the dense cataract that had long covered Liang Xingwang's eye, removed the debris and slipped a new tiny plastic lens under his cornea. She squirted in a few drops of antibiotic and prepared a heavy gauze bandage.
Before the gauze was applied, Mr. Liang caught a fleeting glimpse of the operating room light, his first glimpse of anything from his right eye in years. "I think I could see things!" Mr. Liang, 17, said with wonderment as he moved to a bed in an adjoining room. 
 But there is both a happy and a sad story behind the recent surgery in a small operating room at a community hospital here near Beijing.
Mr. Liang is one of 1.1 million poor Chinese who have had their sight restored through free cataract surgery in the last four years under the Sight First project, sponsored jointly by Lions Clubs International and the China Disabled Persons Federation.
As China has opened its economy and developed its own philanthropically minded middle class, such charity projects are increasingly common. That's the happy part.
The sad part is that Mr. Liang, who suffers from an inherited condition that can be remedied by simple outpatient surgery, spent so much of his childhood nearly blind, even though the technology to cure him was widely available in China.
In Beijing's clinics, 40 miles from Mr. Liang's home, people with enough cash can get top-flight eye surgery for about $500 an eye. But those clinics might as well be on Mars for people like Mr. Liang. Today, medical care in China is almost entirely a matter of cash from individual patients, and there is no public health insurance for the poor.
Twenty years ago, China boasted the broadest public health system in the world, offering free (if basic) health care to all. But the country's shift to a market economy has upended that balance, allowing entry of more advanced medical techniques but also making even simple procedures widely unaffordable.
The World Health Organization now rates China last among developing countries in terms of equal access to medical care. (The United States is last among developed countries.)
Yang Liqun, a government researcher who has studied social services on the outskirts of Beijing, found that only 9.9 percent of people in Shunyi County had any kind of medical coverage. "During the process of reform, the old system of cooperative medical care has suffered devastating damage," he wrote in the journal Beijing Social Sciences.
And so, when Mr. Liang's vision began clouding over eight years ago, he did what rural Chinese often do when they fall ill: he endured. As cataracts from a congenital condition marched over first his left eye, then his right, he tried his best to help out in the family fields and was determined to keep going to school.
Last year, while in the ninth grade, he dropped out of school because he could no longer see his books. But treatment was not an option.
"I never visited a doctor for this until Oct. 1 this year," he said from his bed in the recovery room, referring to the day health workers came to his village looking for patients who might benefit from the Sight First project. "I knew it could be corrected, but we had no money to see a doctor, much less have surgery. So what was the point?"
It is a jarring admission in a country once so committed to egalitarian health care. But during the last decade, as central government financing for hospitals has plummeted, free medical care has given way to hefty patient charges for doctors' visits, surgery and tests.
In China today, treatment is often an economic rather than a medical decision. And charitable donations, often organized by the state, are unable to cover the huge tab that the government has dropped. Cataract surgery, done on an outpatient basis, costs about $50 at the township hospital in Shunyi, about half as much as in hospitals in Beijing.
That is still two to three months' earnings for poor families, money that is in any case consumed by day-to-day subsistence. Mr. Liang's mother also suffers from cataracts and his father lost his arms in an industrial accident. So he lives with his grandfather, who has taken care of him as he has become progressively disabled.
The Lions Clubs program has helped reduce the cost and improve the quality of cataract surgery in China. The group has trained 4,000 doctors in surgical techniques, many in outlying areas, and it has donated some of the latest equipment to diagnose and treat eye disease.
The project helped a factory in Suzhou to gear up to make the little plastic lenses that are the key to the operation's success. Before late 1998, when the plant started production, Chinese-made lenses were of very low quality and imported ones were prohibitively expensive.
But the main contribution at this hospital is, plain and simple, financial. The program pays for the surgery for patients who cannot afford it, and covers the costs of hospitals that say they cannot afford to treat patients free.
"Even though the technology exists here, these people just don't have the money," Dr. Jiang said.
Zhang Bofang, a farmer from nearby Huairou who also had surgery in Shunyi recently, said his vision started "clouding over" in 1997. For the last year he has been unable to tend his field or even walk down the street alone.
With his children grown and gone, his wife tended the family's wheat, peanut and corn fields alone. "It has really been a struggle," said Mr. Zhang, wrapped in the tattered brown sweater he wore for his surgery. "I went to the hospital in Huairou to try to get treatment a few times, but I didn't have the money, so I just had to go home.
"This time it was free. Now I can start working again."

HEADLINE: China Signs U.N. Pact on Rights and Rule of Law

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Nov. 20

 BODY:
Calling it a milestone for China, the top human-rights official of the United Nations signed an agreement here today for cooperation and training on individual rights and the rule of law.
Under the agreement, the United Nations is to advise China's often capricious police forces, courts and prisons on sound legal procedures. It will also monitor legal changes China has to undertake to comply with two United Nations treaties that it has signed but not ratified, on economic and political rights. 
 The United Nations high commissioner for human rights, Mary Robinson, acknowledged in an interview that the agreement was forged at an awkward time. Worried about social stability and threats to Communist rule, China has intensified political repression and efforts to control information. In the two years that the agreement was under negotiation, hundreds of democracy advocates were imprisoned and the Falun Gong spiritual movement was crushed with little regard for legal niceties.
"I'm concerned about the lack of progress in freedom of expression, freedom of association and freedom of religion," Ms. Robinson said. "But I also think it's important to engage with China in detail on the steps it must take to comply with international rights treaties."
Rights groups abroad generally support the agreement, in hopes that it can reduce the police brutality and haphazard application of laws that bedevil the average Chinese more than any abstract concerns about democracy. But advocates also worry that China will use the agreement as window dressing.
"We support technical cooperation on human rights," said Sophia Woodman, Hong Kong representative of Human Rights in China, which is based in New York. "But China often signs these kinds of things hoping it will make other governments stop criticizing their record."
As a first step, a seminar in China in February will discuss how other countries deal with "minor crimes." That should permit dialogue on China's notorious system of "re-education through labor," under which the police can imprison suspected petty criminals as well as political and religious dissidents for up to three years without trial.
The issue of re-education through labor also shows how difficult it may be to achieve basic change. A few years ago, Chinese legal scholars began questioning that system, even calling for its abolition. They cited the gross inconsistency in the way it was applied and the extreme punishments for minor infractions.
Parliament began discussing scrapping the system or putting it under judicial control. But talk of abolition has become unacceptable since the Falun Gong crackdown began last year. The police find it useful to be able to send recalcitrant believers to labor camps without trial and have intensified their opposition to major reform, Chinese legal experts said.
A central goal of the new accord is to help China bring its laws in line with the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The Parliament is considering ratifying the first, but the second remains on the back burner.

Mutual Fund Rewards May Be a Gimmick and a Godsend

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

 BODY:
WOULD you like a mutual fund with those honey-roasted nuts?
Today, the US Airways Group plans to announce that it will offer shares in a mutual fund managed by Merrill Lynch to customers who buy tickets through its Web site. 
 The service is being offered by a start-up, Stockback.com, part of a new group of Internet companies trying to lure online shoppers with the promise of mutual fund shares. U S Airways appears to be the first airline to form a partnership with one of these companies, but there are other ways to acquire mutual fund shares as a perk of flying.
SaveDaily.com Inc., a competitor of Stockback that offers consumers a choice of several mutual funds, has partnerships with online travel services like Priceline.com, Travelscape and Economy Travel. Other airline companies, like AMR, the parent of American Airlines, manage mutual funds but take something of a reverse approach. American offers its fund investors frequent-flier miles as a bonus.
Stockback's offerings put a novel spin on the mutual fund. One recent radio spot features a child named Billy persuading a befuddled Santa Claus to sign up for the service. A second has a woman telling a friend that the lure of saving while shopping made her swear off fighting for parking spots. "Shop for the holidays now," the voice-over in both ads concludes, "and build your savings for the future."
But some people are skeptical about the program. "It may not be the ultimate gimmick, but it's getting close to it," said Harold R. Evensky, an investment adviser in Coral Gables, Fla. "Anyone who suggests it promotes savings is silly."
One consumer advocate offered a historical parallel in a promotion by cereal companies in the 1950's. "When I was a kid, they were giving away deeds to land in Alaska," said Paul Hudson, executive director of the Aviation Consumer Action Project, an airline passenger advocacy group founded by Ralph Nader. "But it would end up being one square inch of land."
To participate, consumers set up a brokerage account with an affiliate, Stockback Capital, and then use Stockback.com as a portal to reach about 90 sites like OfficeMax.com, buy.com and Walmart.com. These companies pay customers back from 1 percent to, in a few cases, as much as 20 percent, along with a fee to Stockback. Initially, US Airways will give no more than $10 back for each ticket, but that will change to a percentage, Stockback said. The perk will not affect a customer's frequent-flier miles. The money goes into the Stockback Fund, a mutual fund managed by Merrill Lynch that invests primarily in large companies but can invest a third or more of its assets in Stockback's partners.
That could be a problem, because many of Stockback.com's partners are online retailers, one of the market's most battered sectors. "The fund itself is a bit of an odd duck," said Christopher J. Traulsen, a senior analyst at Morningstar, which tracks mutual funds. "It will be substantially weighted in retail, which has been a tough place to be."
For US Airways, Stockback.com is a chance to increase a sales channel that is growing but still tiny. The airline -- whose proposed acquisition by UAL, the parent of United Airlines, is being reviewed by government regulators -- derived 12.3 percent of its revenue from online sales in the third quarter. A little less than half of that came from sales on the company's own site.
Stockback's approach has its supporters. The optimistic spin on the offering is that if consumers are going to buy plane tickets or other items anyway, why not get some stock back?
Dr. Joseph T. Hung, 30, an orthodontist who recently set up a practice in Manhattan, is a believer. "I needed everything; I had nothing," he said. Everything included chairs, filing cabinets, telephones and a fax machine. He shopped at buy.com and OfficeMax.com. Then he furnished his apartment, including buying a "humongous" 32-inch television.
After all this, he had a couple of hundred dollars in a mutual fund. "It's maybe $250," Dr. Hung said. "But that's all free and just accumulated over three months. That's free money."

HEADLINE: Europe Acts to Build Own Military Force

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Nov. 20

 BODY:
The European Union today took its first major step to turn itself into a military power, as its defense ministers pledged troops and equipment to create a 60,000-member force by 2003.
The move, which was called for a year ago, is the most important European military initiative since the end of the cold war. It seeks to give European nations the ability to handle a broad range of crises without the United States. 
 Supporters say the initiative will lead the Europeans to shoulder more of the burden for military operations on the European continent and even beyond, which is precisely what American politicians have long demanded.
"The E.U. is determined to play a full role in crisis management," said Javier Solana, the senior European Union official for security policy.
But the plan also raises hard questions.
Are European nations really prepared to spend the billions of dollars that would be needed to turn their plan into a reality?
And will they devise their force in a way that complements and does not undermine NATO, the United States-led alliance that Washington insists should retain the primary role for European security?
All of this makes managing the European initiative an important test for the next administration in Washington as well as for NATO's leadership.
"I want to be supportive of the Europeans carrying a bigger share of their security," Gen. Joseph Ralston, the United States Air Force officer who is NATO's top commander, said in an interview. "We just have to do it in a way that does not detract from the NATO alliance."
The goal of the European initiative is to organize a corps -- about 60,000 troops -- that could be used for separating warring sides, for the more benign peacekeeping operations and for aid missions and other crises. Under the European Union's plans, the force could be sent into the field within 60 days and could stay for as long as a year.
European officials say it is only prudent to develop an all-European force since their governments may confront crises in the Balkans and other trouble spots where the United States is reluctant to get involved.
European politics is also a big factor. Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain has backed the effort as a way to demonstrate his support for European integration. The French, for their part, are seeking to limit American influence in Europe.
The immediate issue for the European defense and foreign ministers who gathered here today was getting their initiative off the ground.
With two million troops under arms in their countries, manpower is not the problem. European nations pledged a pool of more than 100,000 troops, enough to establish a 60,000 force while leaving a reserve. Germany, Britain and France promised the most -- 12,000 to 13,500 each. European nations also offered 400 aircraft and 100 ships.
But getting the troops to a crisis is a different matter. Throughout the cold war, the Europeans' objective was to defend their territory against a Warsaw Pact attack. Unlike the United States, most European nations never structured their armed forces to rush to distant battle zones.
To make good on their new plan, European nations need to buy transport planes and cargo ships as well as communications systems. They need to buy laser-guided munitions to improve their striking power from the air and electronic jamming aircraft to thwart enemy air defenses.
That involves additional military spending at a time when European military budgets have generally been on the decline. European defense chiefs promised to tackle the shortfalls during the next three years.
"Europe has to be ready to bear its responsibilities," said the German foreign minister, Joschka Fisher.
Even with its deficiencies, the European Union plans to have a modest military capacity by next year. It also plans to compensate for its limitations by making use of NATO bases and other military assets, if needed.
To do so, the European Union needs to forge a good working relationship with Turkey, a NATO ally that is not a European Union member and that is unhappy about being excluded from European Union decision-making.
One of the most sensitive issues does not carry a price tag. It is the relationship with the incoming administration in Washington.
The Clinton administration has been generally supportive, calculating that European governments may find it easier to mobilize public support for military spending if it is done under the banner of European unity. The improvement in European military capacity would benefit NATO as well as the European Union, as the two organizations essentially draw on the same forces.
But to maintain NATO's central role and avoid confusion, the Clinton administration has proposed that NATO's military headquarters -- the Supreme Headquarters of Allied Powers in Europe -- plan military operations and establish weapons requirements for both organizations.
"If you have two separate headquarters doing the planning, who is deconflicting the tasking?" General Ralston said. "The same force may be tasked by both organizations at the same time."
British officials are comfortable with that approach. But Alain Richard, the French defense minister, said he favored a "mixed" approach in which both NATO and non-NATO planners would be used, depending on the operation.
Despite the complications, some American specialists said the European move is basically good news for the United States, a step that could buttress the West's overall military potential and dampen the constant criticism in the United States that the Europeans are not pulling their weight.
"The fundamental problems have been caused by European weakness, not European strength," said Ivo Daalder, a former National Security Council aide during the Clinton administration. "If the Europeans can now bring more to the table when it comes to the question of joint action, that can only have positive benefit on most major issues."
But critics say the projected gains in European military capacity may be too meager to justify the risk of creating a potential rival to NATO.
"We could have the worst of both worlds: a European organization that complicates NATO procedures and cohesion and which produces no new capabilities," said Peter W. Rodman, a National Security Council aide during the Bush and Reagan administrations. "I do think that is a risk."

HEADLINE: Oil Price Weighs on Global Growth Outlook

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: PARIS, Nov. 20

 BODY:
In its six-month review of the economy, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said today that it expected growth to remain solid for the next two years but warned that high oil prices could cloud the outlook.
"The overall outlook remains relatively favorable: inflation should remain subdued and economic expansion should continue," the organization said in the forecast of its 29 member countries. 
 For the United States, the organization forecast growth of 3.5 percent in 2001 and 3.3 percent for 2002, down from the 5.25 percent growth projected for 2000.
In the European Union, the report forecast slightly slower growth, 3.0 percent in 2001 and 2.7 percent in 2002. Japan was seen growing 2.3 percent in 2001 and 2.0 percent in 2002.
The report also said the Federal Reserve Board might need to raise interest rates another half-point to keep inflation in check.
The major uncertainty facing the countries was the outlook for oil prices, the report warned, calculating that a return to peak 2000 prices of $38 a barrel through the end of 2002 would cut growth in the major economies by 0.2 percent to 0.4 percent. On the other hand, a drop to $17.50 a barrel, the average of the last 15 years, would ease inflation and increase growth.

An article on Nov. 5 discussed growing cultural and economic conflicts in the Mission District of San Francisco between the working poor who inhabit the neighborhood by day and the Silicon Valley rich who return to its bistros and loft apartments by night. The article included statistics on income level in the district.
The figures were from a study by a San Diego marketing research firm, Claritas, commissioned by The San Francisco Examiner for an article it published on Aug. 29 about conflicts between newcomers and long-term residents. The figures should have been attributed. In addition, the Times article described them incorrectly. The statistics applied only to the section known as the Inner Mission, not to the entire district.

HEADLINE: Bodies Unearthed at East New York Construction Site

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The construction of a shopping mall in East New York has unearthed the remains of two human bodies, officials said.
A crew digging at a landfill that is to be the home of the Gateway Center, a $192 million shopping complex scheduled to open in 2002, unearthed the remains last week. 
 The first victim was discovered on Wednesday and appeared to be a woman in her 20's who the police estimated had been dead less than two years. The next day, workers found the skeletal remains of a man. The police estimated that the man had been dead for more than two years.
The 230-acre landfill, a huge tract of vacant land near Kennedy International Airport, is at the heart of plans for the economic resurrection of the neighborhood, which was known for its high murder rate during the 1980's.
Chain stores, such as Target, Home Depot and Marshalls have already signed on as anchor tenants of the 640,000 square-foot mall. In addition, the plan calls for a 17-acre public park and a 1,200-unit housing subdivision.

HEADLINE: The Big City;
Voting Variety: Sticks Nix Affluent Slicks

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY

 BODY:
WHATEVER becomes of Florida's dimpled chads, there is already a clear result from the presidential election. Suburbanites across America have sent Washington a message: Take my money, please.
New Yorkers can take pride in this new trend, because we were way ahead of everyone else. For nearly a quarter century, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan has been warning that the state pays more in taxes than it gets back from Washington, but New Yorkers have kept voting for higher taxes anyway. And now other Americans want a piece of the action. 
 As the states turned red and blue on election night, the pattern was remarkably similar to a map in "The Federal Budget and the States," the latest in a series of reports begun by Mr. Moynihan in 1977 and now computed by researchers at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. The states voting Democratic were the ones paying more in taxes than they got back from Washington.
Consider the states with the largest per-capita tax deficits, in order starting with the biggest loser: Connecticut, New Jersey, Nevada, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Illinois, Michigan, Delaware, Wisconsin, New York, Massachusetts and California. Ten of the 12 (all except Nevada and New Hampshire) voted against George W. Bush, the candidate promising to let them keep more of their money.
Those Democratic states include huge metropolitan areas where living costs are high and incomes are well above average, especially in the suburbs. It's not surprising that those suburbanites in high tax brackets are sending more than their share of money to Washington. But then why are they voting Democratic? Republicans used to do well in Cheever Country.
One answer has been called the slicks-versus-sticks theory. While Democrats have long done well within cities, they have been gaining strength in the suburbs of the country's biggest metropolitan areas. That is why Mr. Gore won so easily in New Jersey, Connecticut, Illinois and California, and why Florida was so close.
Meanwhile, Republicans have been gaining in the countryside and at the far fringes of metropolitan areas. George W. Bush won a traditionally Democratic state, West Virginia; came close in others like Wisconsin and Minnesota; and triumphed even in Mr. Gore's home state, Tennessee.
These shifts were noted by Michael Barone in a prescient column, published before the election in U.S. News & World Report, that traced Democrats' steady gains in major metropolitan areas since 1988 as a result of cultural issues. "In these vast suburban sprawls, with their sophisticated, cynical, secular voters," Mr. Barone wrote, "Clinton's performance gets high approval and his peccadilloes raise few hackles. Abortion rights and gun control have wide support." But those cultural values don't play well in the sticks.
The long economic boom has made it easier for affluent suburbanites to vote their social consciences instead of their pocketbooks. And the stock market windfalls of the past decade have produced a form of noblesse oblige that Dinesh D'Souza calls the Hollywood effect, in honor of politically liberal stars who make $20 million a film.
PEOPLE who make a lot of money for a little work start to feel that the whole system of wealth creation is just a matter of luck," said Mr. D'Souza, a research scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative group. "They feel people without money are just victims of bad luck, so the government has an obligation to help them."
In his new book, "The Virtue of Prosperity" (Free Press), Mr. D'Souza argues that the long boom has changed politics from a debate over how to create wealth to a debate over how to use it. He points out that the old rule that has people turning Republican as they become more affluent no longer applies.
"There is now an affluent elite in the suburbs that votes for Gore because it wants to educate the rest of society and sponsor government programs that do good," Mr. D'Souza said. "But outside the cities, there's a sullen Middle American who still believes in personal morality and self-reliance. He sees this troupe of educators and philanthropists and social workers deployed for his benefit, and he responds by voting for Bush."
So while affluent suburbanites voted for Democrats vowing not to give them big tax cuts, rural recipients of those tax dollars seemed less than grateful. Of the 20 states with the biggest tax surpluses, 16 voted for Mr. Bush. They too sent a message this election: Keep your money, thanks.

HEADLINE: Fraud Charge Filed Against Dean Witter

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
Legal troubles continued to mount yesterday for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Company when securities regulators accused the investment bank's brokerage unit of misleading thousands of investors into buying mutual funds that resulted in losses of $65 million.
In a rare case of litigation between a major Wall Street firm and the National Association of Securities Dealers, the securities industry's self-regulatory organization, Dean Witter Reynolds is being accused of fraud for the way it sold three bond funds in 1992 and 1993. Dean Witter sold more than $2 billion of shares in the funds to more than 100,000 investors, many of them beyond retirement age and some of them elderly, the association's regulatory arm said in a complaint filed yesterday. 
 Dean Witter told its brokers to promote the funds as safe but higher-yielding alternatives to certificates of deposit without adequately disclosing how much riskier the funds were, the complaint said. The funds, which trade on the New York Stock Exchange, promised to return an investor's principal after 7 or 10 years, depending on the fund, and to pay dividends along the way significantly higher than those offered by government bonds.
To achieve those returns, the trusts invested as much as 40 percent of their assets in derivatives known as inverse floaters, whose value sank when interest rates jumped in 1993 and 1994. The funds, known as term trusts, lost more than 30 percent of their value, and their market value declined by more than $600 million, the complaint said.
That drop led managers of the funds to cut dividends, which prompted about 30,000 investors to sell their shares, most at significant losses, the complaint said. Those losses amounted to $65 million, it said.
"The problem here is that these are long-term investments and they were marketed to people as C.D. substitutes," said Barry R. Goldsmith, executive vice president of N.A.S.D. Regulation. "They were marketed as safe, pure alternatives to C.D.'s, suitable for virtually anybody."
In its complaint, the N.A.S.D. contended that Dean Witter sold the funds to "an extremely large number of elderly, conservative investors." About $380 million, or almost 20 percent of the money invested in the funds, came from people 70 or older, the complaint said. An additional $154 million came from investors in their 80's and more than $22 million belonged to people in their 90's, it said.
Also named in the association's complaint are John B. Kemp, the president of a Dean Witter unit that distributes its proprietary mutual funds, and Lawrence J. Solari, who was Dean Witter's regional director for the Northeast and now is a broker in San Rafael, Calif.
Dean Witter did not dispute those numbers yesterday. But in a prepared statement, the firm said that it was disappointed and surprised by the association's action. "The N.A.S.D. Regulation's action against our firm and the two named individuals is unfounded and without merit," it said.
The complaint will be settled by a panel made up of an N.A.S.D. hearing officer and two representatives of the securities industry. Mr. Goldsmith said the N.A.S.D. had not asked for any specific remedy from the panel, but it could include a fine, restitution to the victims and suspensions or bars for the individuals involved. Along with the $65 million the N.A.S.D. said investors lost, the complaint said Dean Witter took in $119 million in fees and other revenue for underwriting the funds and $7 million annually for managing them.
In its complaint, the N.A.S.D. contended that Mr. Kemp oversaw sales presentations to brokers that "provided an unbalanced picture of the trusts, omitted disclosure of any risks and misinformed Dean Witter's brokers about the nature of the investment." Mr. Kemp approved the removal of any mention of the use of inverse floaters in sales presentations for two of the funds after brokers expressed concerns about them in meetings about the first of the three funds.
The funds were managed by Trust Company of the West, an investment bank in California, and sold to Dean Witter customers under the names TCW/DW Term Trust 2002, Term Trust 2003 and Term Trust 2000. The first two were designed to last for 10 years before dissolving and returning cash to investors; the third was intended to last for seven years.
A Dean Witter spokesman, Bret Gallaway, said the net asset value of each of the funds was now close to its target of $10. If investors had held their shares for the last seven or eight years, they would have received a steady stream of dividend payments and would now be able to sell their shares for prices close to what they paid for them. They have "performed consistent with their stated investment objectives," Dean Witter said in its statement.
N.A.S.D. regulators say that is beside the point of their complaint, which takes issue not with the fine print of the prospectuses for the three funds but with Dean Witter's sales methods and its clearly stated strategy of converting holders of insured bank deposits to owners of volatile bond funds. While Dean Witter was selling the funds, the N.A.S.D. issued several warnings to its members about "sales of C.D. substitutes and the volatility of these kinds of products," Mr. Goldsmith said.
The prospect of litigation with regulators came as Morgan Stanley, which acquired Dean Witter in 1997, was battling the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission over sexual discrimination complaints and trying to recover from a public battle with a former employee who said he had been fired because he was black and perceived to be gay. That case, brought by a young investment banker named Christian Curry, was settled this fall, a year after Morgan Stanley's handling of it led to the resignation of the firm's top lawyer.
The firm recently broke off settlement talks with the E.E.O.C., which said it had found evidence of a pattern of discrimination against women who worked in the firm's investment banking operation. The commission is deciding whether to file suit against the firm on behalf of Allison K. Schieffelin, who sold bonds for Morgan Stanley until she was fired last month.

Stocks Fall on Concern About Profits and Election
Stock prices fell, pulled down by worries about fourth-quarter earnings, ratings downgrades by research analysts and the unresolved race for the presidency. Technology stocks were particularly weak, and the Nasdaq composite index fell to its lowest level since Oct. 28, 1999.
The technology-heavy Nasdaq lost 151.55 points, or 5 percent, to 2,875.64. So far this year, the Nasdaq is down 29.3 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 167.22 points, or 1.6 percent, to 10,462.65, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 25.10 points, or 1.8 percent, to 1,342.62. Page C14. 

Coke Seeks Gatorade, Not Cereal
Coca-Cola and PepsiCo have both been in talks to acquire Quaker Oats because it would mean winning Gatorade, one of the world's fastest-growing sports beverages. But no one on Wall Street believes Coke or Pepsi is interested in the rest of Quaker, and the conventional wisdom says either company would dispose of the rest of Quaker, which makes Life and Cap'n Crunch cereal and Aunt Jemima pancake products. Shares of Coke fell $4.94, to $56.56, while Pepsi rose $1, to $45. C4.

HEADLINE: For Most Local Phone Users, Choice Is Not Yet an Option

BYLINE: By SETH SCHIESEL

 BODY:
AT&T's plan to break itself into four pieces has many experts worried that nationwide competition in local telephone service is at risk.
Four years after a grand political compromise among telecommunications interests was supposed to usher in a new era of consumer choice, only about 3 percent of household and small-business telephone lines are served by a competitor to the longstanding local phone company, according to recent preliminary Federal Communications Commission data. At most, some experts believe, no more than 1 in 10 households has any real choice at all. 
 AT&T officials insist that the company's offspring -- even as they retreat from a strategy of bundling local, long-distance and cable television service into a single product -- will continue to offer aggressive competition for local phone companies.
But many analysts say that is unlikely, and any pullback from AT&T's push into local phone markets would be only the latest disappointment for consumers whom Washington policy makers promised a choice of local telephone providers.
The Telecommunications Act of 1996 was supposed to sweep away barriers to competition that lingered from the era of the first AT&T breakup, in the early 1980's.
But the Baby Bell companies showed a greater penchant for consolidation than for competition, and most upstart local phone carriers decided to focus on serving business customers rather than consumers. Meanwhile, the arcane details of opening local phone networks to long-distance companies and other would-be competitors were mired in legal and regulatory debate.
Most recently, revenue has begun evaporating in the long-distance telephone business, potentially reducing the Bell companies' enthusiasm for that market and undermining the formula -- letting local carriers into the long-distance business once they open their local networks -- on which the Telecommunications Act relied.
And so the supposed tidal wave of competition that the law was expected to unleash is barely a ripple for most local phone consumers. Instead, some consumer advocates say that the local phone giants are set to maintain their dominance in the $100 billion local communications business -- even as federal regulators allow them to expand into the $80 billion long-distance market.
"Certainly less than 10 percent of consumers have any meaningful choice of local service," said Gene Kimmelman at the Washington office of Consumers Union. "There were lots of overblown promises from telecommunications executives that they would provide competition, and it's not happening."
Representative Thomas J. Bliley Jr., the Virginia Republican who was the act's primary author in the House, insisted that the law was fulfilling its promise, if at a measured pace. "Competition has already resulted in lower prices, and it has spurred new, innovative services in many markets, although not all," the representative said yesterday. "It is not surprising that new entry to a market, once 100 percent controlled by the incumbent provider, is taking significant effort."
Most of the customers with a choice, however, are corporations. There were about 191 million phone lines in the nation at the end of June, according to the F.C.C. Competitive local phone companies served about 12.3 million, or 6.4 percent, of those lines. That number is growing quickly, but almost two-thirds of those competing phone lines were connected to big businesses. The slow pace of competition for consumers may be one reason local phone rates have continued to keep pace with inflation since 1996 while long-distance rates have tumbled sharply.
"There are higher margins and higher rates for business customers and consumer prices tend to be much lower," explained J. Cliff Eason, chief executive of the Southwestern Bell unit of SBC Communications. "The competitors are going after the denser-packed business customers more than the consumers."
For consumers, much of the competition is in just two states, New York and Texas, where the Bell companies have been allowed to sell long-distance services. New York is also a primary market for the RCN Corporation, perhaps the only major new local telecommunications company that has focused on serving residential customers.
Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, points to RCN's existence as evidence that the 1996 law is working.
"Only by passing the telecom act, by removing the bar that almost half of all states had in barring almost all local phone competition, would we have this start," said Mr. Markey, who started pushing for an overhaul of communications laws in the 1980's. "It's not perfect, but the passage of the act has led to $40 billion in investment in new infrastructure that will eventually pay off for consumers."
But some communications experts wonder what "eventually" means.
"For consumers, the prospects for local competition look abysmal in the near future," said Brian Adamik, president of the Yankee Group, a technology research and consulting firm in Boston. "In most of the country, it is just not happening."
Assuming that no company was rich enough to build a new phone network to compete with the local Bell companies' wires, the 1996 act required the Bells to sell the use of their systems to competitors.
But that arrangement had a built-in tension. Fundamentally, it was like telling a car company that wanted to compete against General Motors that it had to purchase the use of G.M.'s factories to make its cars.
Though Bell Atlantic (now Verizon) and SBC Communications finally persuaded the F.C.C. that they had opened their systems -- thereby securing the right to enter the long-distance business in New York and Texas, respectively -- some would-be competitors have come to believe that it is just not worth playing by the Baby Bells' rules. Specifically, many potential competitors complain about the prices they are asked to pay for access to the Bell companies' systems.
"What we're finding nationwide, with only a few minor exceptions, is that these rates have been set at a rate so high that it is virtually impossible to make a profit," said John J. Langhauser, vice president for law at the AT&T consumer unit.
AT&T has signed up almost a million local phone customers in New York and Texas, where the company is paying to use Verizon and SBC lines rather than cede business to its competitors.
Rather than depend on the Bells, however, the big plan of C. Michael Armstrong, AT&T's chairman, was to own his own wire into homes and businesses. AT&T spent more than $90 billion acquiring cable television systems, planning to upgrade them to provide local phone service and bypass the Bells altogether.
Now, with Wall Street's impatience with that strategy forcing AT&T to carve itself in four, many communications analysts and executives say that the company's successors will not be able to, or perhaps want to, expand into local phone service so aggressively.
The cable business, for instance, will no longer be able to count on subsidies from the rest of AT&T to underwrite its telephone operation. And the consumer unit will probably have big dividend and interest payments to meet that could be impaired if it signs up millions more local customers.
"We're not going to see AT&T delivering local competition like we thought they would," predicted Robert C. Taylor Jr., chief executive of Focal Communications, a new local carrier based in Chicago that focuses on business customers.
AT&T insists that its separate consumer and cable units will continue to push into local markets. "Our goal is to make the AT&T brand on local phone service as ubiquitous as possible," said Richard J. Martin, an executive at AT&T. "Each of the businesses that we have created has been given the capabilities to offer voice telephone service, and they will each be able to use the AT&T brand in marketing those services."
Ivan G. Seidenberg, co-chief executive of Verizon, says that the slow pace of local phone competition is a nonissue. Consumers and regulators, he said, should look to new technologies, like wireless phones, to provide competition.
"One of the mistakes that people make on this issue is that they are expecting an analogue of Verizon," he said. Instead, consumers and regulators should focus on the changing realities of phone service.
"Joe Schmoe has cut his bill to us in half," Mr. Seidenberg said. "He's buying wireless from somebody. He's buying long-distance from somebody. In three years, having a 'choice' of local phone company will be irrelevant."
Not surprisingly, consumer advocates like Mr. Kimmelman of Consumers Union say that despite the new technologies, consumers suffer without a choice for local service.
"The average consumer spends almost 10 times more time on the phone for local calling than for long-distance calling or wireless calling," he said. "The fact that more people have a wireless phone does not mean that it can compete on price or quality with local calling."
Mr. Adamik of the Yankee Group said: "It seems that we've lost sight of what our long-term interest in telecommunications policy ought to be. We created this vibrant long-distance industry, and now we're killing it; as the Bells enter long-distance it's like shooting fish in a barrel for them. I'm not a big fan of regulation but we have to do a better job of coordinating our long-term telecom policy because right now we're going backward."
With local competition slow to develop and revenue dwindling in the long-distance business, some analysts question whether the grand compromises of the Telecommunications Act need to be revisited. But lawmakers and regulators who participated and watched as the law took four years to enact do not show much stomach for that.
"I would advise caution on reopening the telecom act," William E. Kennard, chairman of the F.C.C., said in a statement. "Local phone competition is advancing. We need to keep a steady course to allow this nascent competition to grow."

HEADLINE: Auto Sales Have Slowed This Month

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: DETROIT, Nov. 20

 BODY:
Auto sales, often a leading indicator of the economy's health, have slowed since the beginning of the month, prompting carmakers to increase their already deep discounts and to consider additional temporary closings of factories, industry officials said today.
General Motors and the Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler have already closed some factories for a week at a time and appear likely to announce further temporary closings soon, they said. Ford Motor has avoided closing factories so far, except because of parts shortages, but its officials have been warning that the entire industry is slowing. And even foreign automakers are seeing some weakness in sales and have been offering many discounts. 
 Shares of G. M. plunged $4.25 each today, to $51.75, after the company predicted that its sales would drop 4 percent to 7 percent this month, compared with weak results in the month a year earlier. The giant automaker predicted that the entire auto industry's sales would fall by a similar amount. G. M. also announced that it had begun offering $500 discounts on 17 high-volume models on top of already available low-rate loans and large rebates.
Struggling with bloated inventories, Chrysler faces weak orders from its dealers for new vehicles, company officials say. Last week, DaimlerChrysler removed Chrysler's president, James Holden, and three of Mr. Holden's senior allies at the company were forced out this morning. But slowing sales do not appear to be a problem confined to Chrysler.
The scale of the industry's slowdown will not be clear until Dec. 1, when many automakers will announce their sales for November. But Wall Street is clearly worried. Rod Lache, an analyst at Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown, lowered his estimates today for fourth-quarter earnings at G. M., Ford and DaimlerChrysler, citing worries about fourth-quarter sales.
Some in the auto industry say that sales have only weakened slightly but that bloated inventories are forcing manufacturers to consider deeper cuts in production.
The auto industry's sales averaged an annual pace of 18 million vehicles last winter, and the industry did not slow down its factories when sales weakened last summer to an annual pace of 17 million, said George Pipas, a market analyst at Ford. Auto executives are now concluding that sales are not going to return to last winter's levels and are trying to decide how to reduce production and sell the extra vehicles that have accumulated on dealers' lots, he said.
"The manufacturers kept producing as if it were an 18 million rate, and for every month you kept doing that, you have to make an inventory adjustment that is greater than the 5 or 6 percent reduction in sales," Mr. Pipas said.
Until the last two years, a sales rate of 15 million vehicles a year was considered strong.
Car dealers say that shoppers are nervous about interest rates and the weak stock market. "There has just been a lack of traffic in the dealerships, they're just not coming in, and why they're not coming in, I don't know," said Frank Ursomarso, a dealer in Wilmington, Del., who sells Pontiacs, Fords, BMW's, Jaguars, Hondas and GMC trucks.
Mr. Ursomarso said that he had sold 123 automobiles so far this month, compared with 138 by this date in November of last year. The proportion of people who enter his showrooms and buy a vehicle has fallen to 26 percent so far this month from 31 percent during the first 20 days of November 1999, he added.
Theodor Cunningham, Chrysler's executive vice president for global sales and marketing, and Kathleen Oswald, the company's chief administrative officer, retired today while Tony Cervone, Chrysler's vice president for communications, quit.
Mr. Cunningham's replacement is to be named soon, Chrysler said. Ms. Oswald's job, overseeing human resources and other administrative activities, is being eliminated. Kenneth A. Levy, a former G. M. spokesman in Europe, will succeed Mr. Cervone.

HEADLINE: Youngstown Reformers Seek Mob-Fighting Tips in Sicily

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio, Nov. 16

 BODY:
After years of struggle with organized crime, and dozens of indictments of officials in this proud city, sadly dubbed Crimetown U.S.A., weary leaders of the reform movement are journeying to the ultimate Old World role model for help.
More than a dozen Youngstown residents will pay their own way to Sicily next month to accept an invitation from Mayor Leoluca Orlando of Palermo to study "the Palermo Renaissance," the progress of that city in rooting out corruption and violence of the quasi-feudal sort that critics say bedevils Youngstown. 
 "We want to look at the cultural side of this," said James B. Callen, a lawyer and a leader here of reformers who have been trying for 20 years to arouse citizens against the political inroads of organized criminals.
Mr. Callen will head a delegation to a United Nations conference in Palermo on new methods for altering the cultural roots of organized crime.
The four-day symposium will focus on programs to influence the young and, through them, their families and society about the traditional ways criminals can exploit cultural solidarity. Re-education through schools and churches is a key part of programs against organized crime under way in Palermo, Hong Kong and Baja California.
Dealing with different ethnic groups but similar cultural tolerances, leaders in the three areas have taken a new tack toward entrenched crime, said Roy Godson, a professor of government at Georgetown University. Mr. Godson runs the National Strategy Research Center, which studies remedies for the problem, and introduced Palermo officials to the efforts of Mr. Callen's organization, the Citizens' League of Greater Youngstown.
Mayor Orlando invited Mr. Callen to the Dec. 12 symposium "to learn lessons from the Sicilian experience in fostering cultural change." For 20 years, Palermo's battle with Mafia criminals has attracted worldwide attention, first with the brazen mob assassinations of leading prosecutors, then with the community revulsion and resolve that followed.
The new Sicilian Renaissance Institute, born of the local reform effort, has been inviting scholars and officials from around the world to study the mix of school, church and political programs that Italian reformers have put to work. The Youngstown visitors will find themselves alongside officials from the Republic of Georgia and other regions deeply troubled with criminal subcultures.
The new re-education approach uses role-playing and pop culture to show youngsters how peer pressure toward casual criminality can be resisted, Professor Godson said. The Baja California school program, for example, uses Spanish versions of the novel "Lord of the Flies" and the film "Goodfellas" to underline lessons on youthful hero worship and the need for fair rules in society. Mr. Godson said that curriculum was being used in schools near both sides of the Mexico-United States border and had been so promising that it would be increased to 60 classroom hours a year from 36.
"This has immense potential," said Mr. Callen, who expects to visit such places as Corleone, a picturesque village steeped in Mafia history, where Sicilian officials say there has been a sharp turnaround in the age-old mistrust of the honesty of law enforcement.
"We hope we'll be able to translate what we find out over there into concrete action here," said Mr. Callen, who for two decades has prodded a spirited and hardly one-sided debate in Youngstown about the pervasiveness of organized crime.
Youngstown's mayor, George M. McKelvey, a popular Democrat who styles himself a leading crime buster, has politely declined the trip to Palermo, arguing that this city is well on the way to recovery from a time when public figures "sold their souls to the mob."
"We are cutting that cancer out of our community," Mayor McKelvey maintains, in the face of skeptical reformers who point to a continuing investigation in which more than 70 officials and local mob figures have been prosecuted.
Youngstown is one of the most scrutinized areas of the country. Waves of special federal investigators comb this eastern Ohio region of faded steel-mill towns and post-immigration insularity long rooted in the mistrust of despotic Old World politics.
Local and federal officials regularly attack a complex nest of political kickbacks and mob corruption punctuated by murder and extending through the surrounding Mahoning County. Even a prosecutor hailed as a mob buster was eventually indicted as tainted, while another prosecutor was shot and wounded after the mob deemed him unbribable.
A tough, blue-collar city, Youngstown has been bypassed by the economic boom in the surrounding suburbs. Residents endure both limited opportunity and the sting of stereotypical Mafia jokes. Through it all, many rally to the colorful, combative local congressman, James A. Traficant Jr., a Democrat who says that both he and the city are being unfairly singled out by federal investigators who are themselves run by the mob.
While steering well clear of that accusation, Mayor McKelvey contends that "ivory tower" reformers have made a grave mistake in claiming that the public is so passive and cynical about local politicians that it accepts ties between politics and the underworld as inevitable.
"This is a key difference," Mayor McKelvey said, touching the heart of Youngstown's reform debate. "I repeatedly hear our electorate insulted, and I don't join in that chorus. The failures here have been on the part of elected officials, not the electorate."
The mayor campaigned first against mob vending machines at City Hall and now insists that a new generation of political leaders is unsullied.
But Mr. Callen warns that unless determined efforts are made to change an underlying culture of tolerance, Youngstown will live out its corrupt habits in a repetition, as in the film "Groundhog Day."
Hearing that, Mayor Orlando wrote Mr. Callen an encouraging note that "Palermo, too, was like 'Groundhog Day' " but now had lessons to offer in "reversing those deep-rooted attitudes of indifference, skepticism and cynicism which are fertile fields for illegality."
Mr. Callen said, "Palermo seems like a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity," and he said he was eager to see what Ohio and Sicily might have in common.
"If this trip forces a confrontation, that's good," he said of his critics in local news organizations and politics. "It's exactly what we need in this community."

HEADLINE: City Revises Plan to Create Jobs for Poor

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON

 BODY:
The Giuliani administration, after winning a nine-month legal battle with the city comptroller over $104 million in city contracts to place welfare recipients into private-sector jobs, is now backing away from that plan, according to the top executive of the company at the center of that conflict.
The move reflects the broad troubles the city has had in starting its new welfare program, according to several contractors involved in the process. Fewer than 4,000 people have been placed in jobs under one set of contracts, compared with a goal of more than 17,000 placements this year, city records show. 
 The complications mean that the city no longer intends to ask Maximus Inc. of Reston, Va., the company at the center of the legal fight between the Giuliani administration and the city comptroller, to deliver all of the services for which it had been hired, said David V. Mastran, Maximus's chief executive. And other companies the city is already working with on the welfare-to-work effort are angry over what they say is a poorly organized program to shift welfare recipients into jobs.
The welfare recipients are being referred to contractors without the required screening to determine if they need to learn English, for example, or if they have drug or mental health problems, several companies under contract with the city said. Even when these recipients are ready for work, they often cannot start or keep jobs because the city has at times failed to provide the needed day care, health care or routine transportation allowances, the contractors said.
"It has been an operational nightmare," said one contractor, who, like the other three interviewed over the last two weeks, asked not to be identified for fear of retaliation by the city. "They could not have done a worse job if they did it intentionally." All four of the contractors provided similar descriptions of the program's problems.
The Giuliani administration did not respond to repeated requests over the last two weeks for documentation detailing progress with the program. Instead, it issued a statement late yesterday that said, "The city's innovative welfare-to-work contracts have helped move thousands of New Yorkers from dependency to self-sufficiency."
The statement did not dispute that the welfare-to-work contracts have not met administration goals. But city officials have noted that the welfare rolls continue to decline, to 557,349 as of last month from a peak of 1.16 million in 1995, in part because many welfare recipients, benefiting from the city's booming economy, are apparently finding jobs on their own. The administration says adding the people who have found jobs themselves to those placed by contractors brings the number of job placements this year to 94,000, although the city would not provide the documentation to support that assertion.
The overall goal has been to transform a welfare employment program run by the city's Human Resources Administration that emphasized placing the poor in manual-labor city jobs, like cleaning parks or city office buildings, into one that focuses on getting them private-sector jobs, like clerical, retail or custodial work.
Starting last year, state and federal grants previously given to the city's Department of Employment were transferred by the Giuliani administration to Human Resources, which then signed contracts with companies that would be paid, with some small exceptions, only if they succeeded in placing welfare recipients in jobs.
Late last year, the city awarded 17 contracts, totaling $469 million over three years. Maximus won $104 million, the largest single chunk. But in February, before payments for any work were approved, Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi objected to the contracting process, claiming that the Giuliani administration had improperly used an accelerated system of picking winning bidders that was less rigorous than it should have been.
Ultimately, Mr. Hevesi blocked only the two Maximus contracts, which he said were particularly troublesome. He said its executives had been given improper access to top officials before the bidding began. Mr. Giuliani sued the comptroller and lost. But last month, the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court sided with the mayor, concluding that the city was justified in using the abbreviated contracting process and that there was no evidence of favoritism toward Maximus.
Criminal investigations of the matter by the Manhattan district attorney's office and the federal government are under way, but the appellate ruling cleared the way for the city to reinstate the Maximus contracts. Mr. Hevesi has until the end of the month to decide if he will appeal, although he has acknowledged that that will be difficult because the the five-justice Appellate Division's decision was unanimous.
To date, Maximus officials and the city have not met to discuss reinstating the contract, company officials said yesterday. The Human Resources statement yesterday said the city was "determining the best way to implement Maximus contracts into the city's ongoing welfare-to-work initiatives."
But Mr. Mastran said his company was in no rush to restart its New York City effort.
"Everybody has been shellshocked" about the process, Mr. Mastran said Thursday in a telephone conference call with investment analysts. "The mayor only has another year in office and the next mayor could possibly be this comptroller. So we are not anxious, really, to step out big time on this."
The plan now, Mr. Mastran told investors, is to pursue a project that would generate only about $3 million to $4 million a year in revenues for Maximus, compared with the approximately $35 million a year previously expected. Under its original contract, Maximus would have evaluated welfare recipients, provided them with job training if needed, and placed them in jobs that the company would find.
Under this new contract, Mr. Mastran said, the company would focus on one of the primary problems in starting the new welfare effort: ensuring that clients referred to the contractors are prepared to actually take on jobs in the private sector.
Several of the contractors said they were getting far fewer referrals from the city than they had expected. And of those whom they did get, only a tiny percentage had been screened. Part of the trouble has been that Maximus was supposed to have helped with the screening, but the problem is so extensive that even if Maximus's contracts had been approved, it would not have been resolved, several contractors said.
The result is that far more of the welfare recipients than the contractors had expected require extensive counseling or other services before they can be placed. The contractors, several of which took advance payments from the city to start their efforts, have in many cases placed so few welfare recipients that the city is asking for some money back. That has angered many of the contractors, who rented space and hired staff members expecting much greater demand for their services than the city has delivered.
For example, the Wildcat Service Corporation of Manhattan, which began work last November, has placed 740 welfare recipients to date, compared with an agreed-upon annual goal of 3,315 placements, according to city documents. America Works of New York, which also started providing services last year, has 231 confirmed placements, compared with its goal of 2,000, city documents show.
Citywide, 30,087 people have been referred to the employment services and placement contractors, and of the 21,843 who were seen by the contractors, 3,711 had been placed as of Nov. 12, according to a city spreadsheet provided by one contractor. That overall placement rate, 17 percent, is less than half of what some of the contractors said they had hoped to achieve. By comparison, an adult job-training program for welfare recipients run by the Department of Employment in 1998 had a 32 percent placement rate, according to a 1999 city audit.
"They have tried to do the right thing, a good thing," one of the contractors said. "But Human Resources is probably the largest and most complex welfare system in the whole country, and to mount something as quickly and all-encompassing as they tried to do was bound to run into a lot of operational problems. And it has."

HEADLINE: Fujimori Resignation Sets Off Succession Scramble in Peru

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, Nov. 20

 BODY:
The Peruvian Congress received President Alberto K. Fujimori's formal resignation today, setting off a flurry of maneuvering by congressional leaders to decide who will succeed him and oversee the transition to new elections.
A day of back-door negotiations led to the resignation of Second Vice President Ricardo Marquez, Mr. Fujimori's hand-picked successor, making it likely that the opposition will take over the government by the end of the week. But it still remained possible that another former aide to Mr. Fujimori could rise to power to administer the transition toward new presidential elections in April. 
 In a letter from Tokyo addressed to Valentin Paniagua, the new president of the Congress, Mr. Fujimori said he was stepping down "to open a definite political path that will permit an orderly transition, and no less important, preserve the solidity of our economy."
With Mr. Fujimori signaling to aides on Sunday his intention to resign and remain indefinitely in Japan, there were spontaneous celebrations in the streets ranging from workers and students dunking each other in the colonial fountains of Arequipa to protestors burning tires in other provincial cities while carrying banners demanding that the entire "Fujimori mafia" be imprisoned. The sense of relief that Peru's long roller-coaster of a political crisis may be coming to an end was summed up by the simple banner headline in today's Liberacion newspaper: "Finally!"
But Mr. Fujimori's resignation, following months of corruption scandals and turmoil in his own ranks, left many questions unanswered, and his country's stability in doubt. The Congress will begin Tuesday what promises to be raucous proceedings to decide who will take over the government until a new elected president can be inaugurated in July. Mr. Paniagua, a veteran centrist legislator, is considered the favorite. But First Vice President Francisco Tudela, who resigned last month, was said to be considering to offer himself for the job.
Mr. Fujimori's shadowy former intelligence chief, Vladimiro Montesinos, apparently remains at large somewhere hidden in Peru while prosecutors investigate charges against him involving money-laundering, gun-running and death squads.
Alejandro Toledo, the main opposition leader who always appears to be abroad at the worst moments, rushed home from Madrid, but not before suggesting that Mr. Montesinos might have already been killed to keep all his secrets and embarrassing videotapes from coming to light.
The government appeared in a shambles tonight, with no one acting as president. Only three members of Mr. Fujimori's cabinet showed up for work today, and at least five Fujimori allies in Congress announced that they were deserting his coalition.
Opposition leaders huddled through the day with congressional allies of Mr. Fujimori and two senior Clinton administration officials who arrived in Lima today. The opposition's efforts to pressure Mr. Marquez to resign appeared to gain Washington's support, and Mr. Marquez was quick to remove himself from the government after taking charge for less than 48 hours.
"What the country deserves is political stability," Mr. Marquez told reporters at the presidential palace tonight. Looking tired and disheveled, he added, "Many political leaders have called on me to resign and I have decided to do that for the good of the stability of the country."
The power vacuum emerged when Mr. Fujimori, 62, telephoned top aides on Sunday to tell them that he would resign and not return to Peru anytime soon.
In a statement released early today, Mr. Fujimori said he made his decision after the opposition took control of the Congress last week -- timing suggesting that he was concerned that the opposition would use its power under the Constitution to remove him by voting that he was "morally incapable" of serving.
The crisis was set off by the presidential elections last April and May, which were widely criticized here and abroad for vote fraud and government manipulation of the campaign. But pressures for Mr. Fujimori to leave office reached critical mass in September, when a videotape was broadcast on a local television channel showing Mr. Montesinos the former intelligence chief, apparently bribing an opposition legislator to join the government's congressional delegation.
While pressuring Mr. Montesinos to resign, Mr. Fujimori announced that he would serve only one year of his third five-year term and then hand power over to a new president to be elected next April and inaugurated in July. Mr. Montesinos fled to Panama, but returned to Peru last month. He remains at large even as government prosecutors investigate several foreign bank accounts linked to him that contain nearly $60 million.
After Mr. Montesinos returned on Oct. 23, First Vice President Tudela resigned. But since his resignation was never accepted by the Congress, he could still be a presidential contender.
After Mr. Marquez resigned, Congresswoman Cecilia Martinez, an influential independent, said she backed Mr. Tudela for the presidency. "No one has questioned his moral authority and he would make a fine president," she said.
Opposition leaders said today that they would move to have the Congress vote not to accept Mr. Fujimori's resignation, and then vote to remove him from office and set up an investigation into his financial dealings for eventual prosecution. They said they welcomed Mr. Marquez's resignation and would work to block Mr. Tudela if necessary.
Throughout the day, opposition leaders had said they were not sure they had to votes to elect one of their own, an effort they said was important to ensure a fair administration of the electoral process for the April 8 balloting. Although the opposition took control of the Congress last week by a 64-51 vote, opposition leaders said that five or six independent lawmakers would probably go along with Mr. Fujimori's forces.
"Paniagua will be the next president of Peru," said Fernando Olivera, an opposition lawmaker and a leading presidential candidate. "There are rumors of Tudela coming back, but I doubt it."
Opposition leaders said they had appealed to the Clinton administration and the Organization of American States to help convince Mr. Marquez that assuming the presidency would only lead to more political unrest. They said they appealed to Peter Romero, assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs, and Arturo Valenzuela, the top Latin America adviser at the White House, who arrived in Lima today, to back Mr. Paniagua.
The United States ambassador, John Hamilton, met today with Mr. Marquez, an adminstration official said, adding that the second vice president was told he "does not have U.S. support."
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said, "We think Paniagua should be the guy."
But it was not clear whether the United States had played a crucial role in convincing Mr. Marquez to step aside. Mr. Marquez always appeared to be an unwilling leader, suggesting a few days ago that he might resign.

HEADLINE: Blue-Collar Urgency: Bathroom Rights

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
For three years, Audrey Jo DeClue endured an endless stream of workplace abuses, according to a complaint filed in federal court. Ms. DeClue, the first female line worker for the Central Illinois Light Company, said she had been shoved, hit and propositioned by male co-workers; had plied country roads in trucks fluttering with pornographic magazines; and had been subjected to the sight of men urinating on the ground in front of her.
So she sued the company for sexual harassment. Alas for her, the statute of limitations had expired for all but one of her grievances: Central Illinois Light's failure to respond to her repeated requests for a private place to relieve herself at work. Her whole case rested on the single issue of bathroom access. And a judicial panel ruled against her on that. 
 Ridiculous? Not for wage-earning women. Though the issue of bathroom access is virtually unknown in the white-collar world, it can be a flash point in factories, telephone calling centers, food-processing plants, construction sites, even schoolrooms. Lawyers, executives and journalists may hop off their chairs and seek relief at will, but employees at lower rungs of the economic ladder can be timed with stopwatches in the bathroom; stonewalled when they ask to go; given disciplinary points for frequent urination; even hunted down by supervisors with walkie-talkies if they tarry in the stalls.
"It's something out of the last century, but it's something out of this century as well," said Charley Richardson, director of labor extension at the University of Massachusetts in Lowell. He thinks bathroom access is being increasingly curtailed in certain workplaces as American businesses adopt Japanese production methods that link workers in interdependent teams. If one ducks out to the bathroom, the whole team flounders, he said.
While no agency keeps comprehensive statistics, occupational health specialists say they hear frequent complaints, especially from poultry workers, who cannot step away from fast-moving assembly lines without causing pileups of dead chickens. Then, said Jackie Nowell, health and safety officer for the United Food and Commercial Workers, which has organized some poultry plants, when a 10-minute rest break arrives, they use up the entire time just walking across cavernous plant floors and taking off their cumbersome rubber smocks and protective gear -- forget about getting to a toilet.
"I hear it a lot," said Ms. Nowell, who added that some workers resort to wearing adult diapers under their gear.
Factory workers are not the only ones afflicted. The Norfolk Southern railway runs hundreds of locomotives without flush toilets, only a "dry hopper system" consisting of a stool lined with a plastic bag. Train operators recently showed their derision by hurling the used bags off moving trains, but Norfolk Southern moved to restore order by printing employee numbers on the bags, and keeping track of which employees brought them back full.
When Marc Linder, a labor historian at the University of Iowa in Iowa City, surveyed a group of grade-school teachers in that state, more than half said they were pinned down in their classrooms for hours at a stretch, unable to relieve themselves. Most coped by avoiding coffee and water, but a few routinely wore sanitary pads to work and "11 percent of elementary schoolteachers brought all the children with them to the bathroom when they were unable to hold it any longer," Mr. Linder said.
Disturbed by such findings, he went on to be a co-author of a 244-page history of workplace bathroom practices in the United States and Europe, "Void Where Prohibited" (Cornell University Press, 1997). The title may be a pun but the rest of Linder's tour d'urinal is grim, revealing among other things that the federal government regulated the number of toilets at workplaces but did not require companies to let workers use them. (The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has since issued a memorandum closing that loophole. Mr. Linder says he plans to research whether the memorandum has had any effect.)
In Illinois, Ms. DeClue's high-voltage electrical crew worked in open farmland, with no gas stations or even trees to hide behind. Once, she ducked behind a bulldozer for cover, only to discover she was squatting directly in view of a homeowner who came out and excoriated her, then went back inside and reported her to the utility.
Her question for the court: Did the electric utility's failure to provide sanitation and privacy constitute harassment? A federal district judge in Peoria threw out the case last December. Ms. DeClue appealed. At the appellate level, the three-judge panel split revealingly along gender lines.
The two male judges conceded that women may be "more reticent about urinating in public than men," but said Ms. DeClue had erred by making her case on "hostile work environment" grounds rather than "disparate impact" grounds, and they could do nothing for her.
To that, the female panelist, the Reagan appointee Ilana Rovner, issued a remarkably personal dissent. She chided her colleagues for their "formulaic constructs" of gender discrimination. She wondered how eagerly a lone male would "drop his trousers" after bouncing around in a truck full of female co-workers and pornographic magazines. She recalled that as recently as the early 1990's, the seemingly trivial issue of bathroom access had the power to change the course of government: because there were no women's rooms convenient to the House and Senate chambers then, female legislators risked missing votes.
Legal scholars say that nearly a quarter- century after President Jimmy Carter began naming large numbers of women and minorities to the federal bench, women jurists are lending a measurably more receptive ear than males to cries of gender discrimination. Judge Rovner's opinion makes an illuminating example of that trend. She remembered her own appointment, and the welcoming note she received from a male judge who said, "At long last, the ladies' room off the judges' conference room will have some use!"
"Thank goodness there was a woman's room," Judge Rovner wrote, in a dissent some have interpreted as a call for more women to come forward with bathroom-access complaints. Already, a case is moving through the lower levels of the same federal circuit, involving a female construction worker who says she was required to stay in position for a whole day with no chance to relieve herself. In her complaint, she says she heard a "pop" and wet herself. When a colleague took her to the hospital, she was fired for leaving her post.

HEADLINE: WINE TALK;
Where the Sommeliers Shop

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial

 BODY:
IN New York's overheated wine market, restaurant owners and their sommeliers are often forced to go to auctions to find the fine wines they want. Last Saturday, one of the city's best-known restaurateurs did just the opposite: he went to Sotheby's to sell wine, about $343,000 worth, as it turned out.
The wine, some 241 lots of it, was from the cellar of Union Square Cafe, Danny Meyer's popular restaurant on East 16th Street. All but three of the lots were sold, according to Oliver Bareau of the wine department at Sotheby's, many of them to other restaurants. 
 It was the first time since wine auctions became legal in New York in 1994 that anyone could recall a high-profile restaurant's selling wine in a place other than its dining room.
"We were running out of room," said Mr. Meyer, who owns the restaurant with his partners, Michael Romano and Paul Bolles-Beaven. "I've been paying between $30,000 and $40,000 a year for refrigerated storage space in New Jersey. Things were getting out of hand."
Almost as important was the rapidly increasing value of so many of the restaurant's older bottles. The prices of many fine and rare wines have increased exponentially in the last decade. "My customers don't come in looking for $2,000 bottles of wine," Mr. Meyer said, "but that's what some of this stuff was worth." In fact, a case of a rare Bordeaux, Chateau Le Pin 1982, brought $24,150 at Saturday's auction. "I paid less than a tenth of that when I bought it," Mr. Meyer said. "I couldn't afford to keep it any longer." Similarly, six bottles of Sine Qua Non, a syrah from a small, so-called cult winery in California, sold for $1,400, while a case of 1990 Chateauneuf-du-Pape from the renowned Chateau de Beaucastel went for $1,300.
The most expensive lot sold was five cases of 1990 Bordeaux; one each of the chateaus Lafite-Rothschild, Mouton-Rothschild, Latour, Margaux and Cheval Blanc. It went for $21,650. A single case of Bryant Family Vineyard Napa Valley cabernet sauvignon went for $6,325.
Of particular interest was the fact that none of the Union Square wines were old and possibly past their prime. The oldest wines offered were the 1975 Chateau d'Yquem from Sauternes and a 1978 Burgundy, a Pommard Rugiens from the Domaine Michel Gaunoux. Most of the wines offered were from the 1980's and 1990's, some from very recent vintages, like a case of 1998 Batard-Montrachet, a rare white Burgundy, from the Domaine Paul Pernot.
Mr. Meyer opened Union Square Cafe in 1985, shortly before the current, frenzied market in fine wines began. He established his wine cellar by buying at prices newer restaurant owners can only dream about. "I bought way, way too much," Mr. Meyer said. "I used to buy 20 cases when I needed, at most, 10." It would seem to have made sense to share the inventory with his other New York restaurants, Gramercy Tavern, Eleven Madison Park and Tabla. But each has its own liquor license, and under state law it is illegal to use one restaurant's license to sell wine from another.
No doubt, many sommeliers, restaurant owners and wine stewards would love to have Mr. Meyer's problems. In fact, wine-trade professionals accounted for as many as half of the purchases at Saturday's auction. Well-heeled collectors bought the rest. Some of the Union Square Cafe wines should begin to appear on other restaurant wine lists fairly soon.
Restaurants that opened in the 1990's have often been desperate to find enough wine to create any cellar at all. Ralph Hersom, the wine steward at Le Cirque 2000, said he has never had excess inventory (the cellar was severely depleted before the move from 65th Street). Indeed, he often haunts the auction rooms, the only places to find the high-priced rarities that some of Le Cirque 2000's guests demand.
Other restaurant owners have found other ways to control their wine inventories. The Ryland Inn in Whitehouse, N.J., has one of the most extensive collections in the New York metropolitan area. The owner and chef, Craig Shelton, sells wine to an informal club of regulars and then stores it for them to use when they come to the restaurant. At Windows on the World, in the World Trade Center, the wine director, Kevin Zraly, controls his large stocks by what he calls "spring cleaning."
"This is the high season," he said, "right through Jan. 1. Then everything slows down. In February and March we simply stop buying and work off our inventory. All our suppliers know this, and they leave us alone until we call them."
In the peaceful days before wine shortages, restaurateurs used different techniques to thin out their wine collections. In the 1980's, at Le Chambertin, a small West Side restaurant with an excellent wine list, the owner, Louis Daniel, would go through his cellar periodically, singling out wines, usually top Bordeaux he felt had reached their peak. Then he would offer, at an irresistible price, dinners for two or four that included several bottles of the wines he wanted to move.
At the "21" Club, when H. Peter Kriendler was one of the owners, he would cull famous but aging wines from the restaurant's collection and offer them at $100 a bottle regardless of vintage or provenance. "No guarantees, no returns, no complaints," he would say. "You may get a dud, you may get a great buy." Harsh terms, but "21" regulars lined up.
Sotheby's had no trouble selling Union Square Cafe's bottles either. "It was a great success," Mr. Meyer said. "We sold 99 percent of everything we offered." In fact, his timing was excellent. This is the wine buying season, and while the economy may be slowing at some levels, it obviously has not yet affected the high rollers and eager restaurateurs who buy expensive wine.

HEADLINE: British Retailer Thrives the U.S. Way

BYLINE: By SUZANNE KAPNER

DATELINE: LONDON, Nov. 21

 BODY:
When making out their holiday shopping lists, few investors would place shares of British retailers at the top. They have been among the worst-performing stocks this year as the industry undergoes a profound shift that promises to alter permanently the way many of these companies do business.
In sharp contrast to the clumsy results from Marks & Spencer and Arcadia, where profits are shrinking, Matalan, one of Britain's pioneering discount chains, is cut from a different cloth. 
 Its net income has doubled in each of the last three fiscal years, to 37.6 million ($53.5 million), on sales of 398 million ($566.7 million). And there appears to be no end in sight. Through Aug. 26, the end of the first half of Matalan's fiscal year, profit doubled yet again as sales jumped 58 percent.
Since Matalan went public in 1998, its shares, adjusted for splits, are up more than tenfold. They closed today at 738 pence ($10.51).
"Matalan keeps beating earnings estimates, and the estimates keep going up," said Biagio Manieri, a senior analyst with Federated Investors, which counts Matalan as a top-10 holding in its $1.3 billion International Small Cap fund. "It's the Target of England," he added, referring to the discount store chain in the United States.
Matalan's resemblance to American discount stores is no accident. The company was founded by John Hargreaves, 57, the son of a Liverpool dock worker, who left school at 14 and cut his teeth as a street vendor selling second-hand goods from Marks & Spencer. Some years later, while vacationing in Los Angeles, Mr. Hargreaves was impressed with the supercenters springing up along the freeways and returned to England, where in 1985 he opened a warehouse-type store in Preston, 200 miles north of London.
Today, Mr. Hargreaves's 52 percent stake in Matalan is worth some $2.2 billion. As chairman, he still oversees many day-to-day details, like signing off on new collections. More than 80 percent of Matalan's merchandise is designed in-house, and one recent Monday morning Mr. Hargreaves inspected fall 2001 babywear, deciding which of Matalan's 112 stores would stock which pint-size jumpers.
The formula has been winning over British shoppers.
Pat Selsby, 56, and her daughter Linda, 31, used to shop at the local Marks & Spencer near their home in North London. Now they drive an extra 30 minutes to shop at the Matalan store in Greenwich.
"The value is brilliant," Mrs. Selsby said.
British consumers have not always been treated to great value, analysts say. "The U.K. has been a rigged market in terms of pricing," said one, who insisted on anonymity. "Things have been presented as good value which really haven't been. They've been priced to make a return on an expensive cost base."
While in the United States rents are often based on a percentage of a retailer's revenue, rents in Britain are fixed. If they move at all, it tends to be in one direction -- up.
At the same time, Marks & Spencer, Britain's largest retailer, stuck steadfastly to a policy of obtaining products domestically. As the pound soared, so did merchandising costs.
Faced with these rising costs, retailers simply raised prices, which worked fine until the Asian crisis in 1998 flooded England with cheap imports. Then came Rip Off Britain, the government crusade aimed at wiping out inflated pricing.
To stay competitive, retailers have had to cut prices deeply, which set off spiraling deflation. Recent figures from the Office of National Statistics show the sharpest decline in clothing and footwear prices since 1947.
Scrambling to lower costs, Marks & Spencer has recently restructured to obtain more products overseas -- but not before profits took a hit.
British consumers, like shoppers elsewhere in the world, meanwhile, started spending less on clothing and footwear, and more on travel, health and electronics. When they did buy, it was less from middle-market chains and more from discount stores or the luxury sector.
"Most retailers were unprepared for these changes and are still reeling from the shock," said Richard Hyman, chairman of Verdict Research.
Matalan, which already operated on a skeleton cost base, was one of the few prepared for these changes. Angus Monro, Matalan's chief executive, estimates that the company's costs are about 13 percent below those of in-town competitors because it pays less rent on out-of-town stores and cuts out middlemen by buying directly from factories.
To be sure, Matalan's lead is narrowing as other retailers are forced to become more efficient. And even though the discount market in Britain is still relatively small, commanding just 11 percent of retail sales last year, it is unlikely to dominate as it does in the United States. Population density means that a majority of Britons still shop in town. And strict regulations curtail building in rural parts of the country.
Even the world's best retailers, from Wal-Mart to the Gap, stumble eventually. With Matalan shares trading at 50 times this year's earnings, compared with an average price-to-earnings ratio of 17 for the retail sector, some analysts are concerned there could be quite a fall.
For now, though, Matalan executives are bent on bringing American-style value to Britain. Mr. Hargreaves and Mr. Monro recently returned from a trip to Long Island, where they scouted local Target and Kohl's stores for ideas.

HEADLINE: Theater Club Has Plans for Broadway House

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
The Manhattan Theater Club, one of New York City's most prominent nonprofit theaters, has agreed to renovate and take over operation of the Biltmore Theater, a deteriorating Broadway landmark that has been dormant for more than a decade.
The deal is dependent on city approval of a development proposal that includes a high-rise apartment building next to the theater. 
 The 75-year-old Biltmore, damaged by fire in 1987, will be rehabilitated as part of a plan by a consortium headed by the Jack Parker Corporation that includes construction of the new apartment building with four floors of commercial space at 47th Street and Eighth Avenue. The theater club will put up one quarter of the $18 million renovation costs, and the rest will be paid by a development consortium, said Barry Grove, executive producer of the theater club.
"The Biltmore is a theater that needs to be rescued," said Mr. Grove. "The Manhattan Theater Club has been looking for additional space for quite some time."
Plans for the project require approval from the City Planning Commission and the City Council because the proposed apartment building would be larger than ordinarily permitted by the city's zoning code. The developer plans to seek approval for a "theater bonus" that would allow construction of additional space because of the rehabilitation of a landmark Broadway theater.
The bonus would allow construction of the planned adjacent building to grow from as few as 33 stories, or 270,000 square feet, to as many as 62, or 480,000 square feet, said Martin McLaughlin, a spokesman for the development consortium, Biltmore 47 Associates.
If the developer is not granted the bonus, Mr. McLaughlin said, the high-rise would proceed, but the theater restoration would fall away. "If they don't give us the bonus, we're not going to get the extra revenue and the deal will fall through," he said.
The project is to be designed by Polshek Partnership Architects, whose work includes the Rose Center for Earth and Science at the American Museum of Natural History and the current renovation of Carnegie Hall. Under the plan, the theater club would continue to operate its two theaters, with capacities of 299 and 250 seats, at the City Center on West 55th Street. The rehabilitated Biltmore is expected to open in time for the 2002-3 Broadway season.
The Biltmore Theater, originally a 948-seat space, will be redesigned with a 623-seat capacity and improved public amenities, Mr. Grove said. The promise of a new stage comes at a time when the theater club has moved two shows to Broadway -- "Proof" and "The Tale of the Allergist's Wife" -- and when its nonprofit peers are increasingly looking to Broadway.
The Roundabout Theater Company, which recently moved into the historic Selwyn Theater (now called the American Airlines Theater) on 42nd Street, renovated at a cost of $25 million, and Lincoln Center Theater's Vivian Beaumont stage are already considered eligible for Tony Awards. The Biltmore would make Manhattan Theater Club productions Tony-eligible, which brings national exposure and a potential boost to ticket sales.
Mr. Grove said that the theater club would also consider selling the name of the theater to a sponsor. The Biltmore will allow the theater club to have an orchestra pit for the first time, and fly space for scenery. "We've been bursting at the seams at City Center in terms of audience capacity," Mr. Grove said. "A larger canvas is natural."
Although acknowledging that the theater club's budget of $11 million would have to increase to accommodate its new overhead, Mr. Grove said he was not prepared to estimate by how much. The theater club, which would have a long-term lease on the theater, will mount a capital campaign to help pay for the Biltmore's renovation, Mr. Grove said.
The developer will also be seeking approval from several city agencies or panels to include in the new building unused air rights from the adjoining fire house at the corner of West 48th Street.
Last year the Biltmore became the subject of a court battle between a real estate developer, Joseph Moinian, who said he wanted to restore and book the theater, and the Nederlander Organization, which said it might try to more than double the house's size so that it could accommodate big musicals.
The Moinian Group is now a partner in the consortium headed by the Parker Corporation, which owns numerous properties around town including the Parker Meridien Hotel.
Small theaters like the Biltmore, Belasco, Cort and Lyceum have been difficult to book because they have second balconies where many theatergoers don't want to sit and limited seating which makes it difficult to earn a return on a theatrical investment. But given the recent strength of the real estate market, the popularity of the Times Square area and the demand for Broadway theaters, these properties are suddenly more attractive.
John Fisher, the president of the Clinton Special District Coalition, said he was concerned that apartments in the proposed high-rise would command top rents and put further pressure on prices in the rapidly changing neighborhood to the west. "The city should have its working class neighborhoods, and it should have its version of the Hamptons," he said.

Troubled Session Scatters Investors in Many Directions

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stock investors, although tired of selling and eager for a rally, struggled in vain to find a direction yesterday and sent stocks wavering throughout a choppy session.
Uneasiness about falling profits, the country's economic slowdown and more analyst downgrades of high-profile stocks made it impossible for any substantial gains to stick. By the end of the day, investors had taken to their recent approach of bidding blue chips moderately higher and selling technology issues. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average at times soared above 100 points, but it retreated to close up only 31.85 points, or 0.3 percent, to 10,494.50.
Broader indicators were mixed. The Nasdaq composite index ended off 4.19 points, to 2,871.45, after bobbing in and out of positive territory. It was the Nasdaq's lowest close since Oct. 27, 1999, when it finished at 2,802.52.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 4.73 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,347.35.
Investors were still waiting for Wall Street's typical post-election rally and they seemed to want to bid stocks higher. However, they had trouble overcoming disappointments about earnings and worries that the economy is slowing at an uncomfortably fast pace, analysts said.
"They're trying to bounce a little bit," said Jim Myers, director of technical research for Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. "But the economy is softening faster than most people suspected."
Investors were somewhat inspired by good earnings results reported by two technology companies, Agilent and Medtronic. Agilent, the company spun off by Hewlett-Packard, gained $4, to $48.63. Medtronic, a medical technology concern, rose $1.56, to $51.13.
But, analysts said, the market still has some unrealistic earnings expectations, and that means the sharp sell-offs in recent sessions will continue when companies come out with disappointing results.
"We are still going to have to come to grips with earnings expectations that are too high," Mr. Myers said.
But investors are right to focus on earnings, some analysts said.
"Prior to this year, you could buy just about any stock and it would go higher," said Chris Dickerson, market analyst for Global Market Strategists. "Now you have to be a lot more careful and pay attention to the fundamentals of the stock."
Investors punished Lucent Technologies, pushing it down $3.38, to close at $17.56, after it announced that its fourth-quarter revenue was $125 million less than it first reported.
Yahoo slid $7.19, or nearly 15 percent, finishing at $41.69, after Mary Meeker of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, the well-known Internet stock analyst, said Yahoo had a 30 percent chance of missing revenue estimates for the current quarter.

Little Change on Yields
By Reuters
Treasury bond yields were little changed yesterday as uncertainty over the presidential contest compounded already depressed pre-Thanksgiving volumes.
The 10-year Treasury note rose 3/32, to a price of 100 23/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.65 percent from 5.66 percent on Monday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond climbed 12/32, to 107 13/32. The bond's yield declined to 5.73 percent from 5.75 percent on Monday.

HEADLINE: September Trade Gap Raises Some Fear on Pace of Slowdown

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 21

 BODY:
Imports surged, exports slipped and the United States trade deficit widened sharply to a record in September, raising fears that the economy is slowing faster than expected and that the robust dollar may come under pressure.
The trade gap reached $34.3 billion in September as imports rose to $126.62 billion, up 3.1 percent from August, and exports fell 0.7 percent, to $92.36 billion, the Commerce Department announced today. The deficit is on course to reach $365 billion this year -- it grows on average by $1 billion a day -- with the total likely to surpass the record 1999 level by about $100 billion. 
 Most economists have treated the seemingly relentless march of the deficit with relative equanimity this year, arguing that it reflects the disproportionate strength of the United States economy compared with major trading partners and, more recently, the possibly temporary rise in the price of imported oil.
But September's data, which was considerably worse than expected, seems to have shaken that confidence. Some economists have begun to wonder whether the combination of the large deficit and a dollar that has strengthened sharply against most major currencies all year raises the risk of a hard landing.
"This is the Damocles' sword hanging over us -- the largest long-term threat to our economy," said Greg Mastel, a trade expert at the New America Foundation. "The next administration is likely to have to adjust trade policy, dollar policy and fiscal policy to find a solution."
The deficit numbers prompted several Wall Street analysts to lower their estimates for economic growth for the third quarter. Several said that they feared that the weak exports reflected tough competition from abroad while high imports suggested that retailers were piling up goods for Christmas sales that some think may be less vigorous than expected, leaving bloated inventories.
Salomon Smith Barney downgraded estimates of economic growth in the third quarter to slightly less than 2 percent, from 2.7 percent, arguing that the poor trade performance knocked anywhere from half to three-quarters of a percentage point off domestic growth for the quarter. Merrill Lynch and several other firms also cut growth estimates.
The Federal Reserve, of course, has been trying to slow the economy without touching off a recession, and to an extent the American ardor for imports and the buying power of a strong dollar advance that goal.
Even economists who say they are worried about the large deficit are not really sounding the alarm; as long as the United States continues to be the strongest magnet for world investment, trading partners may well go on financing the trade gap indefinitely.
But that view assumes that the deficit will top out on its own and not expand quickly. The combination of expensive oil, the recent surge in the value of the dollar against the euro and tough competition for American manufacturers has actually prompted the deficit to widen faster than it did earlier this year.
The dollar is a particular concern. Backed in part by the longstanding Clinton administration preference for a strong dollar, the currency has risen a little more than 20 percent the last 12 months against other major currencies. That is well beyond what some economists think should be its natural trading range.
After the Clinton administration's support for intervention to shore up the euro this fall, the next administration will probably consider at least a subtle tweaking of dollar policy. The goal would be to stabilize exchange rates or signal a desire for a modest retreat, potentially helping United States exports and discouraging imports, economists said.
In September, the trade deficit with China widened. The gap with China, a major supplier of consumer goods and electronics, hit a record $8.72 billion for the month, compared with $8.6 billion in August.
The China trade gap has become the biggest. But the deficits with Mexico and Canada also grew to records. The deficit with European nations and Japan, however, eased. The trade gap with Japan, the second largest after China, fell to $6.09 billion from $6.76 billion in August.

HEADLINE: Power Agency Details Plans For Electric Turbines in City

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Stepping in to reduce the threat of blackouts next summer, the New York Power Authority is detailing its plans to install a fleet of small electricity generators around Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx and on Long Island and possibly in Staten Island.
Not only do officials hope to avert blackouts with the generators, but they also hope to hold down the price of electricity on hot summer afternoons, when high demand pushes up power rates in the newly deregulated market. 
 "We're trying to increase reliability here in this city," said Clarence D. Rappleyea, the chairman and chief executive of the power authority, which plans to make the announcement of the new plants today. "We're trying to keep the lights on in the city of New York, and I think everybody knows what happens when we have a problem with that."
In fact, the decision by the state-owned agency to install the generators was a sign that deregulation of the utility industry is not working as was anticipated, at least not yet. The idea behind deregulation was that entrepreneurs would rush to build new power generators to meet high demand, as occurs in other parts of the economy.
"It's kind of going back into the old regime," said John W. Dax, a lawyer for NYC Energy, a company that is trying to win permission from various state and federal agencies to build a 79-megawatt power plant at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. The plant would be built on a barge and could be put in place quickly, Mr. Dax said, but the Power Authority's action was making it difficult to win financing.
"Everybody is saying, do I want to invest in a project that has had the economic legs kicked out from under it by the state," Mr. Dax said.
But Mr. Rappleyea, in a telephone interview, said that the generators would probably not be a good business proposition and that his agency was spending an extra $50 million for additional pollution controls, something that he said a private entity would probably not do.
The Power Authority generators, built by General Electric, will burn natural gas and are to be equipped with acoustic muffling and with devices called selective catalytic converters. Akin to the catalytic converters on cars, they sharply reduce nitrogen oxides, which are a cause of smog, acid rain and particulate pollution. All locations chosen by the Power Authority are in industrial areas, except for one, on Staten Island, which is adjacent to a Con Edison substation but which has housing in the area. That one is still under study.
In a regulatory shortcut, the generators are slightly smaller than the size that would require approval by the state bureaucracy that regulates power plants, although they will need approvals from the Department of Environmental Conservation. There will be 10 of them, or 11, if the site on Staten Island is used. The Power Authority announced in September that it planned to add plants for peak days; it will say today that it has found places to put them.
New York City entered the summer of 2000 with too little capacity for comfort, according to the commission's staff, but made it through because the weather was relatively cool. Demand is growing by 1.5 percent a year, the commission said.
In addition, the area is short of transmission capacity. That has led the organization that arranges power sales in the state to order that companies selling power in New York City have enough generating capacity within its borders to meet 80 percent of their load, a criterion that the Power Authority does not now meet. The generators, shipped in 14 segments and looking like a series of grey metal boxes, are about 140 feet long and 40 to 55 feet high, with a 100-foot stack on the end. Each occupies about an acre. Gas comes in from under ground, and electricity leaves that way.

HEADLINE: Hundreds of Workers Strike At 2 Newspapers in Seattle

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER 

 BODY:
Newspaper Guild workers at Seattle's two daily newspapers, The Seattle Times and The Seattle Post-Intelligencer, went on strike yesterday over issues including wages, pensions and health benefits.
Their walkout began the first newspaper strike in this heavily unionized town in 47 years. Not since guild members walked out of The Detroit News and The Detroit Free Press in 1995 has there been a guild strike against a major-market daily. 
 Art Thiel, a sports columnist for The Post-Intelligencer and a spokesman for the guild, said yesterday that about 90 percent of more than 900 workers -- circulation personnel, copy editors, reporters, photographers and advertising sales representatives -- had walked out.
But H. Mason Sizemore, the president of The Seattle Times, said that when he walked through that newspaper's newsroom yesterday morning, he was "surprised at the number of Newspaper Guild employees who have chosen to work today." Both newspapers are continuing to publish during the strike.
The Times, which is controlled by the family of the publisher, Frank A. Blethen, and The Post-Intelligencer, which is owned by the Hearst Corporation, have separate newsrooms but their business functions are handled jointly by The Times, the senior partner of the two.
Of the 940 or more workers represented by the guild, about 130 work for The Post-Intelligencer and about 810 work for The Times. About 500 of those Times workers are in the advertising, circulation and marketing departments.
In telephone interviews yesterday, spokesmen for both sides in the dispute kept their language studiedly muted. When Mr. Thiel was asked about the worried comments of some reporters, who on Monday night urged their colleagues to wait 48 hours before going out on strike, he said: "Clearly apprehension by a number of people -- as there should be. If people aren't apprehensive about this, they've got a screw loose." He would not venture to guess how long the dispute might last.
The walkout began in the predawn hours of Tuesday morning after guild negotiators, on Monday, rejected what the newspapers' management called the final wage offer: a $3.30-per-hour increase over a six-year contract.
Union negotiators had sought about $4 over three years, though Mr. Thiel indicated that this was negotiable. According to Kerry Coughlin, a company spokeswoman, a federal mediator reported late Monday that the union had reduced its demand to a $3.25-per-hour increase, though still over a three-year period.
The two sides also failed to come to terms on pension and health benefits.
Currently, the top-minimum wage for a reporter at The Times with six years' experience is $857.73, or $21.44 per hour. At The San Jose Mercury-News, which this summer signed a new contract with a strike deadline looming, the comparable top-minimum salary for a reporter is $1,053.
But a company spokeswoman pointed out that merit-pay increases had raised the average newsroom wage 28 percent above contractual minimums. Senior reporters, according to a survey provided by the company, make $29.29 per hour, 4 percent above the median for similar employees reported in a survey by an industry group of 24 comparable newspapers.
Mr. Sizemore said, "Over five years, our increases are above the cost of living. Our wages are competitive with the local economy. The jobs we hire for nationally are competitive with what other people are paying."
Circulation workers, on average, have a lower pay scale, making as little as half what their newsroom counterparts do.
Two rank-and-file guild members from the editorial department at The Times said in telephone interviews yesterday that they were more concerned with the fate of the lower-paid employees.
"I felt I couldn't in all conscience be a credible journalist if I didn't think about others who are in a less-fortunate situation than I'm in," said Stanley Holmes, the aerospace writer at The Times. "Frank Blethen has been good to me and I appreciate that. But it's also about reasonable contract, reasonable representation and reasonable dialogue between the union and management."
The negotiations and their eventual impasse put pressure on Mr. Blethen's bottom line at a time when his minority shareholder, Knight Ridder, has publicly expressed dissatisfaction with The Times's performance. Knight Ridder holds a 49.5 percent share in the business. A buyout offer by P. Anthony Ridder, Knight Ridder's chief executive -- who has long chafed at The Times's industry-lagging profit margins -- was recently rejected by Mr. Blethen.
The Times, which recently reported a daily circulation of about 226,000, ceased afternoon publication eight months ago, beginning a head-to-head competition with the morning Post-Intelligencer. The latter's current daily circulation of 176,000 is about 15,000 below last year's level, an indicator that the new competition has hurt.
Mr. Sizemore said he expected that 92 Teamster-represented truck drivers, who handle the bulk delivery of the newspapers to major distribution sites, might honor the guild picket lines. But, he said, he had replacement drivers on hand.
Would other replacement workers fill in for the newsroom and business-side jobs? Mr. Sizemore responded, "Depending on how long the strike lasts, we have to figure out about making decisions about how to replace the people who choose not to work."

Slim Building Casts a Modern Image

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
The slender 24-story glass tower rising at 11 East 52nd Street in Manhattan has been described as a thermometer, totem pole, exclamation mark and space needle, while the architect himself has compared the planes of its sloping glass and steel facade to a guillotine blade slicing down.
To the Austrian Cultural Institute -- which expects to move next fall into the building, between Fifth Avenue and Madison Avenue -- the narrow tower's design will help create a modern image for Austria, as well as a conversation piece and tourist attraction for New York. 
 And despite his conjuring up images of Madame Defarge, Raimund Abraham, the Austrian-born architect, who says his comparison was intended in jest, has no doubt that the sloping building will live up to the institute's expectations.
"I was excited that this was a slim building," said Professor Abraham, who teaches architectural design at Cooper Union. "Its smallness provided me with a predetermined proportion of the tower."
Christoph Thun-Hohenstein, the director of the Cultural Institute, who holds doctoral degrees in law and philosophy from the University of Vienna, said, "Our old building became too small for our exhibitions, movies, concerts and lectures."
A diplomat who served in Bonn, Geneva and the Ivory Coast, he is 14 months into his four-year appointment to the institute, and eager to move into its new home.
For now, the institute is on the 20th floor of 950 Third Avenue, at the corner of 57th Street. There, among other duties, Dr. Thun-Hohenstein is busy planning 10 weeks of cultural events to celebrate the formal opening of the $20 million building next October.
Together with pride in his design, for which an international jury awarded him first place in 1992 over designs submitted by 225 other Austrian-born architects, Professor Abraham praised the project's development team. That includes the New York construction manager, Barney Skanska USA, and the New York structural, mechanical, electrical and plumbing engineer, Ove Arup and Partners.
At a mere 25 feet wide -- "barely wide enough to change your mind in," according to one passer-by -- the building was a challenge for the architect, and continues to challenge the engineers and workers who have to wrestle with minuscule tolerances and tight squeezes at almost every turn.
"A small building is a lot tougher to work on than a big building, because there's no room for anything," said Vincenzo Labarbera, the labor foreman at the job site for Barney Skanska. "There's no room to store material, so we're moving things all the time."
With horizontal space at such a premium, the piano for the building's planned 75-seat theater on the second and third floors will be stored in a space in the ceiling, from which it will be lowered onto the stage by a piano lift as needed, then returned to its resting place.
To save space while complying with New York law that buildings have at least two independent exits, Professor Abraham designed what are basically two stairways in one, known as "scissors stairs." At times they run side by side or above and below the other, separated by a firewall.
"I knew if one could not arrive at maximum usable space it would not be economical to build on the site," he said, recounting the political jockeying in Austria that thwarted construction on the building for almost five years. In 1995, the project was suspended after construction had started. Part of the wrangling involved a dispute over money; another issue involved a change of government.
By the time the foundation at 11 East 52nd Street was excavated almost two years ago, after the limestone townhouse on the site was razed, Austria's Ministry of Foreign Affairs had turned the development of the building over to an Austrian corporation.
The corporation, Bundes Immobilien Gesellschaft, the Federal Real Estate Corporation, is widely known by its initials, BIG. Since its founding in 1992, the corporation has managed and built some of the Austrian government's real estate holdings.
But BIG had never developed a building abroad. So its authority to do so came only after several years of debate and after a parliamentary resolution in 1996 amended Austrian law to allow BIG to work outside the country. While the Austrian government still owns the land at 11 East 52nd Street, BIG is the developer. It hired Hanscomb Inc., the New York construction consultants, as its representative to oversee the project.
For several years Professor Abraham despaired that his design -- his second in the United States (the first was for the Anthology Film Archives in Manhattan) -- would fall victim to politics in the country from which he emigrated in 1964. And whenever he visited Austria, he would hear about the project.
"Because of the political controversy," he said, "people on the street would ask me how the building in New York was coming along."
For all the partisan wrangling, Professor Abraham said, "there was never an attempt to influence or interfere with the architecture." He added, "I always considered it my project of destiny."

HEADLINE: Canada's Premier Tugged to Right by Challenger

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: TORONTO, Nov. 16

 BODY:
Riding out of the West on a platform of tax cuts and born-again social conservatism, a smooth-talking college-dropout-turned-politician named Stockwell Day has given Canadian politics its biggest shake-up in years.
Even though Prime Minister Jean Chretien and his Liberal Party are likely to extend their seven-year rule in the national election on Nov. 27, it was Mr. Day and his new Canadian Alliance that prompted the vote and forced Mr. Chretien to tack uncharacteristically hard to the right. 
 In the process, Mr. Day has challenged some of the cornerstones of Canada's identity, including the generous social spending that has saddled Canadians with one of the world's highest tax rates.
One month after Mr. Day arrived in Parliament this fall, Mr. Chretien's government suddenly announced the biggest tax cut in Canadian history, put at about $65 billion over five years. With Mr. Day having lost his main issue, Mr. Chretien then called a snap election, cutting short his second five-year term at three and a half years, the shortest term for a Canadian majority government since 1911.
Although Canadians tell pollsters they do not want an election, the 66-year-old prime minister does not want to wait a year to allow his 50-year-old rival to spread his message. On the social side, Mr. Day, an evangelical Christian, wants to show the world that Canada is not Scandinavia West. On the fiscal side, Mr. Day, a former Alberta treasury minister who instituted a flat income tax for his province, preaches that by cutting taxes, Canada can reverse its southward-flowing brain drain.
"The whining sound you hear is the sound of U-Haul trailers loading up and leaving the country because of high taxation," he told an Alliance rally in a Toronto suburb. The equivalent of a small Canadian city leaves each year for the United States, and referring to that loss of ambitious, well-educated Canadians, Mr. Day said, "Patriotism is wonderful, but if you can no longer afford it, you'll say, 'I'll put my flag in my pocket and put it on the wall of my new house in Denver and sing "O Canada" there.' "
In Ontario, the nation's economic powerhouse, people increasingly say they oppose Canadian income tax rates, which often total 50 percent. "It's a shame that Canada leads the G-7 in taxes," Monica Lozneanu, 19, a television production assistant, said here, referring to the group of industrial nations. "Stockwell Day looks like a leader. I think a lot of my friends will vote for him."
For party organizers, the conversion of people like Ms. Lozneanu to Mr. Day's Canadian Alliance is crucial for the new party to break out of its western birthplace and establish an electoral beachhead in Ontario, home to a third of Canadian voters.
"It is as if you rolled New York and California into one state," Rod Love, Mr. Day's strategist from Alberta, said here of Ontario's importance. Arguing that conservative voters dominate in suburban Toronto and interior Ontario, Mr. Love said approvingly of Ms. Lozneanu's politics: "It's like Nixon's silent majority. The people who obey the law, who pay taxes will vote Stockwell Day."
Arguing that a Canadian pays 25 percent more taxes on average than does an American, Mr. Day plans to spend his last week campaigning in Ontario, a province that has given him large, enthusiastic crowds.
Polls indicate that Mr. Day's drive to unite the right may fall short of its goal of depriving Mr. Chretien of a third consecutive majority government. In the last election, in 1997, Mr. Chretien won a slim 51 percent majority of parliamentary seats with only 38.5 percent of the popular vote, one of the lowest winning totals in Canadian history. He won the majority largely because, in a five-way race, the conservative vote split in Ontario between two right-wing parties, the Progressive Conservatives and the Reformers, the Western-based predecessors of the Alliance.
While polls indicate that Mr. Day is favored among Canadian men outside of Quebec, he lags among women voters who are uneasy about positions he has expressed, but not repeated recently, on abortion, gun control, gay rights and the death penalty. During the campaign, which is restricted to 36 days, Mr. Day has avoided controversial stands on social issues, which have been cut from his party's platform. He has been so smooth that Joe Clark, leader of the rival Progressive Conservatives, derided him in a debate as a "television game-show host."
Button-down Eastern Canadians also feel uncomfortable with Mr. Day's "American style" fondness for the campaign photo opportunity. A trim man who tries to exercise one hour a day, the conservative candidate has been photographed chopping wood, in-line skating, kick boxing and, dressed in a wet suit, zooming across a lake in a personal watercraft.
Those midlife athletics are an extension of a knockabout youth, part Captain Canada, part Jack London.
Mr. Day has lived in half of Canada's 10 provinces as well as in the Arctic territories. The son of a chain store manger, he spent his childhood in Ottawa, where he learned early political lessons, and in Montreal, where he learned serviceable French, a virtual requirement for federal office in a country where nearly one-quarter of the population speaks French.
During the 1970's, Mr. Day spent his 20's bouncing around a variety of jobs in the Canadian West -- working as construction day laborer, picking up bodies for a hearse company, shipping out as a deckhand on commercial fishing boats, driving a logging skidder in the Rockies, working for an oil and gas supply company in the Northwest Territories, killing cows in an Alberta slaughterhouse, running his own auction house and installing curtains for an interior designer.
"It was like something straight out of a Peter Lorre movie -- you'd go down some dark alley and a door would creak open and there would be the guy who worked in the funeral home, deep in the cover of night," Mr. Day said of his job picking up bodies in "Stockwell Day: His Life and Politics," a new biography by Claire Hoy. Of his work in native communities in the north, he said, "You'd be driving out on the frozen Arctic or on the frozen delta carrying a payload of 100,000 pounds of explosives, and the guy you traveled with was an Inuit worker, so you got to know a lot about Inuit life from the ice level up."
In contrast to his current white-collar image, Mr. Day dropped out of two colleges, never getting a diploma. As a youth, he says, he smoked marijuana -- and inhaled. In that hirsute phase of his life, he attracted the attention of Valorie Martin, a pet groomer who lived next door. They married, and she has taken care of his haircuts ever since.
Partly because of his wife's influence, Mr. Day became a strong believer in evangelical Christianity. He and his wife turned their house in Edmonton into a counseling shelter for runaway teenagers addicted to drugs. After studying briefly at a Bible college in Alberta's capital, he worked as a lay pastor and school administrator in Bentley, sometimes described as "the buckle of the Alberta Bible Belt." Living there for eight years with Valorie and their three sons, he gained prominence as a champion of evangelical schools.
From that base, Mr. Day was elected to the Alberta legislature in 1986. Rising through the ranks, he served eight years as a minister in conservative governments, stepping down last spring as treasury minister.
The outspoken Mr. Day says that his careful statements are often taken out of context, and that his call for a "values based" approach to teaching sex education in schools was reduced by reporters to total opposition to sex education. Mr. Day wrote in a letter to his local newspaper, the Red Deer Advocate: "I am not against sex. (Ask my wife.) I am not against sex education. (Ask my kids.) I am for parental choice of what type of sex education kids should be getting."
Opposed to Canada's new gun-registry law, Mr. Day bought a .38-caliber handgun when the first such bill was introduced in Parliament in 1994. Actions like this prompted Maclean's, a national news weekly edited here, to publish a Day cover article last summer with the title: "How Scary?" The writer mused ominously: "There is something, well, vaguely American about him."

U.S. Trade Deficit Rose To a Record in September
Imports surged, exports slipped and the United States trade deficit widened sharply, to a record $34.3 billion in September, raising fears that the economy is slowing faster than expected and that the robust dollar may come under pressure.
The trade deficit is on course to reach $365 billion this year -- it grows on average by $1 billion a day -- with the total likely to surpass the record 1999 level by about $100 billion. Page C12. 

Privacy Worries on E-Mail Tracking
New software allows senders of e-mail to learn, undetected, when recipients read the messages and whether they send them to anyone else. Marketing companies regularly keep tabs on which prospective customers open their e-mail solicitations, and at what time of day, arguing that the data is used to devise more personalized promotions. But privacy advocates contend that such practices open a new window of surveillance on a traditionally private sphere of communications. A1.

HEADLINE: Joyful Holiday Travel

 BODY:
Thanksgiving, like any self-respecting holiday, is all about tradition. You have your family, your turkey, the annual argument about how long it should be cooked, the Lions game on TV, the pumpkin pie and the day-after sales. Oh, and don't forget being trapped for hours at an airport so mobbed it brings to mind the hellish "Gone With the Wind" scene of the Confederate wounded at the rail yard.
This year, with America's arteries clogged even on the best of days, the holiday travel season may be more trying than ever. At La Guardia Airport in New York City, to take one notorious case, the system is so strained that less than half the flights arrived on time in the month of September. Yet over the Thanksgiving holiday, a quarter more passengers than usual will be flying through La Guardia. That does not mean more flights, only longer lines and more frayed nerves. Nationwide, a record 2.2 million people are expected to fly on Sunday. At Newark Airport, passengers are being advised to show up three hours before their departure time over the holidays. 
 The onslaught of winter in parts of the country and the airlines' acrimonious labor relations threaten to create further mischief. There is at least one disgruntled union at all five of the largest airlines. Though no job actions have been publicly acknowledged, the airlines are wary. United and Northwest have obtained court orders directing their mechanics not to engage in any slowdown or other disruptive action over the holidays.
In recent days, United had to cancel an unusually large number of flights due to maintenance-related problems and has accused the union of an illegal slowdown. As harried travelers well know, United was forced to cancel some 20,000 flights this summer because of pilots' rejection of overtime out of frustration over the state of contract negotiations. Now Delta may face a similar predicament. The angst surrounding holiday travel should focus attention on the inadequacies of our transportation infrastructure. More than just a hassle, congestion threatens our economic well-being. Airline deregulation in the late 1970's caused a dramatic increase in air traffic, but the public entities of the aviation system have not adapted to the brave new world. Washington has been operating on autopilot when it comes to transportation matters.
Money is an issue, but not the only issue. Other countries have proved more nimble and creative at effecting reforms to cope with a surge in traffic. There is no scarcity of proposals worth considering in this country, from resolving the institutional conflict of interest at the Federal Aviation Administration (it is both the operator of the system and its safety cop) to a wholesale privatization of the air traffic control system. Some academics have floated the idea of giving airlines antitrust immunity to coordinate scheduling. An emerging consensus would have airports at long last adopt a more market-based approach to pricing landing rights, something now being considered by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
The next president, whoever that may be, ought to think creatively about these issues and exert some leadership to alleviate the congestion in the skies. Distressingly little was said on the campaign trail about transportation issues, even though "air rage" and "road rage" have entered the nation's lexicon to describe the growing frustration people feel when stuck in traffic, either driving to work or flying across the country.
That anxiety should be in full evidence this holiday season. But whatever delays you may experience, don't get enraged at the beleaguered airline employees. Remember, it's not their fault.

Congress Puts Baseball Economics in Play

BYLINE: By IRVIN MOLOTSKY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 21

 BODY:
Senator Mike DeWine, an Ohioan whose state embraces a baseball team of "haves," the Cleveland Indians, and "have-nots," the Cincinnati Reds, convened a Congressional hearing today to ask what baseball was doing to make teams in small markets competitive.
Every team "ought to have hope" at the beginning of the season, he said, paraphrasing the song from "Damn Yankees," the musical about the lowly Washington Senators when they were more than just one of the chambers of Congress. 
 "The status quo is simply unacceptable," said DeWine, a Republican and longtime Reds fan. "Unless something is done to correct the payroll and revenue disparities among the teams -- unless we untie the stranglehold around the small- and medium-market teams by increasing competition -- baseball cannot survive."
Bud Selig, the commissioner of baseball, testified and supported DeWine's complaint.
"An increasing number of our clubs have become unable to successfully compete for their respective division championships," he said, "thereby making postseason appearances -- let alone postseason success -- an impossibility.
"The enduring success of our game rests on the hope and faith of each fan that his or her team will be competitive. At the start of spring training, there no longer exists hope and faith for the fans of more than half our clubs."
And unless something is done, he said, the disparities will grow because the teams with greater broadcast income will be able to sign the best players by outbidding teams with less lucrative contracts.
"In an age when the Yankees are rumored to be in line for a $100 million-a-year local media contract," Selig said, "it is difficult to have hope in Montreal, which, for the 2000 season, had no television contract and local revenue of just $14 million."
Selig said that sweeping changes were needed to correct the imbalance so that "all clubs -- those from markets that are diverse geographically, demographically and economically -- are provided a reasonably level playing field on which to compete."
DeWine said that he had called the hearing, by the antitrust arm of the Judiciary Committee, not to draw up legislation but instead to air a problem, which is done frequently in Congress.
Witnesses included the journalist George F. Will, the sports broadcaster Bob Costas and the former Senator George J. Mitchell, who repeated some of the findings of a panel that previously looked into baseball's economic imbalance.
"Changes are necessary if competitive balance is to be restored," Mitchell said. "When you have such clear symptoms of a problem, you act lest you wait until the patient is dead."
In answer to a question from DeWine, Selig said that baseball had in place a system in which 30 percent of the revenue was distributed from the larger to the smaller clubs.
"Is it enough?" DeWine asked. "No," said Selig, who added, "We need to take that 30 percent and boost it up."
Selig said that the Yankees were paying $17 million in revenue sharing, the Mets $15 million, with the clubs at the bottom (which he did not name) receiving $23 million, $20 million and $16 million.
Selig said that baseball as a whole was "in a loss position," with 18 to 20 of the 30 clubs having lost money in 2000.
DeWine suggested that some owners were willing to suffer losses in anticipation of selling their clubs at a big profit later.
Selig responded: "I heard that for many years and it was true to an extent. That is the 'greater fool theory.' The problem is that we've run out of greater fools."

HEADLINE: China to Stop Selling A-Arms Delivery Systems

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 21

 BODY:
The Clinton administration and China said today that China had pledged to stop selling missile parts or the equipment needed for missile production to countries developing nuclear weapons.
In exchange, Washington agreed to waive economic sanctions for past sales of such materiel to Iran and Pakistan, the State Department said. This will allow American companies to apply again for licenses to launch satellites on Chinese rockets. 
 The agreement would help bring China into line with international standards restricting missile-related exports, officials said. They said that step, like membership in the World Trade Organization, would push China to be more responsible.
But in announcing the accord, which President Clinton and President Jiang Zemin reviewed at their meeting last week in Brunei, officials cautioned that China's pledges have yet to be enacted. "This looks good on paper," said one senior official involved in the talks. "What we'll have to watch is implementation," a job for the next administration.
The most promising aspect of the accord, officials said, was China's commitment to adopt an export-control list under which Beijing would require Chinese companies to get licenses to export "equipment, materials and technology that can be directly used in missiles, as well as missile-related dual-use items."
But the Chinese failed to specify what penalty companies would suffer if they exported without licenses.
It was also unclear how thoroughly the export-control list would be in compliance with the Missile Technology Control Regime. That agreement, which restricts sales of specific missiles and missile parts, was signed by 32 countries, but not China.
China's continued export of missile production facilities to Pakistan has been of particular concern in Washington since the nuclear tests by Pakistan and India in 1998.
The issue complicated White House efforts to win Senate passage of a bill this year granting China permanent normal trade relations, especially after American intelligence agencies reported that China exported a few dozen long-range missiles to Pakistan in 1992 and sent missile production facilities in the 1990's. Among the items China sent to Pakistan after the 1998 nuclear tests were specialty steels and guidance systems.
The announcement today, in effect, confirms those Chinese exports, which under American law required sanctions. The administration said today that while technically it was imposing the sanctions, it was waiving them in view of the new pledges.
For American companies, the immediate effect will be the unfreezing of licence applications to launch American satellites on Chinese rockets. Applications were frozen in February because of concerns that Chinese aerospace companies were exporting missile-related materials to Pakistan and Iran.
Many American companies, from cellular telephone networks to international television conglomerates, are waiting in line for satellites to be sent into orbit, and China has expressed eagerness to offer low-cost services.
Two American companies at the forefront of satellite launches in China, Hughes Space and Communications International and Loral Space and Communications, will not be affected by the waiving of sanctions, officials said, because they are under investigation to determine whether they improperly advised the Chinese on rocket design in the mid-1990's without obtaining licenses. The companies have denied any wrongdoing, but officials said they would not be allowed to apply for licenses until the cases are resolved.
In the past, Washington has twice imposed sanctions on China for its proliferation of missiles.
Each time the sanctions were lifted on the strength of promises made by Beijing. In 1991 sanctions were imposed on China for assisting Pakistan's missile program in the late 1980's; they were lifted a year later. In 1993 sanctions were imposed for China's help to Pakistan for the building of M-11 missiles; they were removed in 1994 when China agreed to comply with the main provisions of the technology control regime.
In light of China's past record, the agreement today was greeted with some skepticism. Senator Fred Thompson, Republican of Tennessee, said, "Once again, the Clinton administration appears to be rewarding China for promises made instead of promises kept."
A Democratic staff aide said the "jury was still out." But the agreement appeared, for the first time, to rule out any kind of Chinese assistance for missile programs in other countries, the aide said.
Yet the accord merely says in its first paragraph that China has no "intention" of assisting, in any way, any country to develop ballistic missiles that can be be used to deliver nuclear weapons, the aide said.
At a State Department briefing, a senior official was asked if the administration was letting China off the hook. In reply, the official argued that having made the "legal determination" that China had indeed exported missiles, exports that required sanctions, the administration then chose to waive the penalties.
"The purpose of the law after all is not to impose penalties," the official said. "The purpose is to encourage better nonproliferation behavior."

Florida Court Allows Hand Counts Until Monday
The Florida Supreme Court unanimously ruled that recounts could continue in three heavily Democratic counties but that the results must be submitted no later than Monday morning. It set no standards for determining how to count partially punched ballots. A1
 
The matter of whether ballots with small indentations on the unpunched boxes next to the names of Gov. George W. Bush or Vice President Al Gore count as votes could swing the election. Without the so-called dimpled ballots, Mr. Gore has little chance to overtake Mr. Bush. A1
 
Officials on both sides described the two candidates as intransigent, but Mr. Bush enjoys a political advantage because his backers are as determined as he is: they are more unified and more willing than Democrats to wage total war, at all levels legal and political, to win. A21
 
Major donors and fund-raisers for Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush expressed continuing support for their candidate and their cause, at least for now. Many say they are willing to invest whatever it takes to finance the postelection efforts. A21
 
Maria Cantwell, the Democratic candidate for United States Senate in Washington, pulled ahead of the Republican incumbent, Senator Slade Gorton, by nearly 2,000 votes, with fewer than 12,000 still to count.

HEADLINE: Peru After Fujimori

 BODY:
Alberto Fujimori, the unpredictable and often erratic president of Peru, resigned from office this week while on a visit to Japan. Peru's Congress, in turn, refused to accept his resignation and instead ousted him, declaring him "morally unfit" for office. It was an appropriately bizarre exit. The circumstances surrounding Mr. Fujimori's decision remain somewhat mysterious, but should not obscure the fact that his departure is a positive development. Peru's citizenry and opposition parties, as well as the international community, should capitalize on this opportunity to encourage the start of a new democratic era in Peru.
Valentin Paniagua, a Fujimori opponent and president of Peru's Congress, is poised to assume the nation's presidency until the elections scheduled for April. His caretaker government ought to focus on creating the conditions for a truly free election, conditions that were woefully absent in last summer's contest presided over by Mr. Fujimori. Peru must establish an autonomous electoral authority to oversee the process, grant its judiciary independence and provide competing political factions with equal access to the nation's media. 
 More broadly, the new government ought to restore a sense of stability and certainty to Peruvian life. The nation's 27 million people and fragile economy have been held hostage to the whims of Mr. Fujimori and his shadowy intelligence chief and indispensable aide, Vladimiro Montesinos. The new government must also pursue investigations into the alleged criminal activities of Mr. Montesinos, who reportedly squirreled away at least $58 million in overseas bank accounts and is now believed to be in hiding in Peru.
Peruvians living in poverty -- more than half the population -- were the real victims of President Fujimori's determination to retain power at all costs. The economy shrank in September as a result of the furor following the broadcast of a video that showed Mr. Montesinos paying a bribe to a politician. President Fujimori was once the darling of foreign investors, but as his administration became increasingly arbitrary, tax collection rates plummeted, capital fled the country and prospective investment dried up.
Not long ago, Washington would have greeted Mr. Fujimori's departure with mixed feelings because of his support for drug interdiction programs. Mr. Montesinos had longstanding ties to the Central Intelligence Agency. But in recent months Washington wisely distanced itself from both men. The United States should now welcome the formation of a more legitimate caretaker government and offer its assistance to assure that new elections are free and fair.

HEADLINE: Lucent Lowers Revenue Stated In Last Quarter

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

 BODY:
Lucent Technologies warned shareholders yesterday that it would revise financial results already reported for the last quarter by cutting revenue by about $125 million. The unexpected move by the company, a maker of communications equipment, sent shudders across Wall Street.
Shares in Lucent plunged 16 percent, to $17.56, deepening the decline in the stock price to 75 percent this year. Lucent said the reduction in revenue could cut 2 cents a share from earnings for the quarter and the year. The company had originally reported earnings of 18 cents a share, or $600 million in profits from operations, on $9.4 billion of revenue. 
 In addition, the company warned investors to ignore earlier estimates for financial results for the quarter ending in December while an investigation of its accounting practices by its outside auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers, begins.
Lucent had previously said revenue for the fiscal first quarter would decline 7 percent from $7.9 billion in the period a year earlier, while earnings from operations would break even at about $1.08 billion. The company has warned that earnings will be lower than expected each quarter this year.
"Just when you thought you were bottom-fishing with Lucent, wham" said Daniel P. McKelvey, managing partner of Forte Capital, a private equity and money management company in San Mateo, Calif.
Lucent's most recent woes reflect the problems the company faces in seeking to compete with companies that have eroded its market share as the transmission of data over the Internet has grown in importance over the delivery of voice calls. A host of nimble new companies, like CoSine Communications and Juniper Networks Inc., and larger companies like Cisco Systems and Nortel Networks, have benefited from a prescient emphasis on data transmission that Lucent, with its roots in the old Bell telephone system, has been slower to take advantage of.
The move renews pressure on Henry B. Schacht, who replaced Richard A. McGinn last month as Lucent's chief executive, and on Deborah C. Hopkins, who was appointed the chief financial officer earlier this year after occupying a similar post at Boeing. Lucent did not make either executive available for interviews.
"From what I understand, this came on her watch," said Michael E. Eggly, co-manager of the Northern Communications Fund in Chicago.
In a statement, Mr. Schacht said: "We wanted to make this public as soon as we discovered the issue. I have asked our outside auditor and our outside counsel to assist us in doing a complete review of this and any related issues."
While Lucent declined to specify the source of the revenue shortfall, some analysts who felt left in the dark shifted their opinion of the company. Michael Ching of Merrill Lynch downgraded the stock from a buy to accumulate and lowered his earnings estimate for the fiscal year 2001 and the quarter ending in December.
"I'm not suggesting that there's anything sinister going on at Lucent," Mr. Ching said, "but the release of information in this way raises more questions than it provides answers."
Analysts were also left to question whether Lucent will adopt different accounting practices as a result of yesterday's announcement. Among large makers of telecommunications equipment, Lucent was known for relatively aggressive ways of recognizing revenue. The appointment of Mr. Schacht as chief executive could lead to a change in these practices, analysts said.
"Lucent needs to tread carefully not to appear in a similar league with Oxford Health Plans and Tyco International," said John Gonsalves, vice president of Adventis, a communications consulting company based in Boston, in reference to two companies accused in the past of misleading investors about their financial situation. "Quick, solid disclosure of information on their part would be a positive move."
Lucent has hired the law firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore to assist in the review of its financial results, a process that some analysts said could result in shareholder lawsuits. Such defensive moves by Lucent, which is the world's largest maker of telecommunications equipment, with yearly sales of more than $34 billion, should put competitors on alert, said Adrian Slywotzky, a senior partner at Mercer Management Consulting.
If these kinds of bombs can explode at Lucent, Mr. Slywotzky asked, are there other potential land mines lurking elsewhere in the industry? "At a time when trends in communications infrastructure are developing far faster than they were a couple of years ago," he said, "now is when companies need to focus more than ever on their customers' needs."
Many investors, of course, have already shifted their focus from Lucent to other companies in telecommunications and different sectors of the economy.
"All I can say is that I'm happy we got Lucent out of our portfolio," said John P. Waterman, managing director of Rittenhouse Financial Services, a Philadelphia investment manager that sold all of its 7.2 million Lucent shares in the last several weeks.
Lucent gave no indication of how soon it would explain what caused the shortfall.

HEADLINE: Trenton Backs Off Proposal To Take Control of Camden

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON

DATELINE: CAMDEN, N.J., Nov. 21

 BODY:
New Jersey backed away today from its ambitious plan to take over the collapsing fiscal and civic management of Camden. Instead, it offered a blueprint for recovery based on cooperation with a city government that state officials were once determined to supplant.
Yet even today's plan, a mix of economic incentives and administrative money savers for the all-but-bankrupt city, relies on a central feature of the takeover legislation introduced last summer: a powerful executive at the center of all City Hall decisions, with the mayor and the City Council in subsidiary roles. 
 The original takeover proposal, which is still before the State Legislature, envisioned a supermanager taking over the core roles now performed by elected officials. But the idea quickly ran into strong opposition from several important elements in the Legislature, including black members -- Camden's population is mostly black and Hispanic -- and the dozens of mayors and municipal council members who are also state legislators.
Today, instead of pursuing that root-and-branch approach, Jane M. Kenny, the state commissioner of community affairs, presented a consultant's plan that puts the state back in the position it once said was intolerable: needing the consent of the Camden City Council and its mayor, who is now on trial on corruption charges.
Announcing the plan at a news conference on Camden's waterfront, state officials seemed to be keeping all their options open, proposing a new approach while keeping the old one alive. Ms. Kenny would not even say that the state endorsed the new plan. "It's not up to the state to endorse it," she said, "because this plan could not be implemented without the cooperation of the city and other leaders."
But today, the president of the Camden City Council reacted coolly to the plan.
There are two versions of the takeover plan awaiting committee action in the Legislature. Today's plan is likely to become part of the debate.
Most of Camden's operating budget is paid for by the state, yet New Jersey officials have been frustrated in their efforts to instill a sense of frugality in the city's operations. Camden fails to collect nearly a third of its real estate taxes, but its payroll and benefits eat up two-thirds of the annual budget. City employees receive higher salaries and better benefits than most other public employees in the state.
Ms. Kenny, whose agency enforces the state's municipal management laws, said today's proposal was an alternative to a takeover.
"What we put on the table originally was a very bold, radical approach that we hoped would very quickly begin to solve the city's problems," she said. "But we said at the time that if we can get the same goals at the end of the day -- change the status quo, get some professional government in place, provide necessary services to the people -- then we would not be wedded to one particular way of doing things."
The new proposal, the City of Camden Multiyear Recovery Plan, was drawn up by Public Financial Management, a Philadelphia consulting firm. It calls for a city manager equivalent to a chief operating officer: someone "with sole responsibility for hiring, directing and managing personnel, coordinating day-to-day operations and implementing the management initiatives of the multiyear plan, and proposing ordinances."
But it did not say who would appoint the manager. In the old takeover plan, the manager would be appointed by the state.
The elected City Council, the new plan suggested, would have an oversight role like that of a board of directors in private industry.
But the plan immediately ran into opposition on the Council. Gwendolyn A. Faison, the Council's president, attended today's event and said afterward that she strongly favored the elements that involved spending state money in Camden, including money to help pay the city's debt and revitalize its economy.
But in language reminiscent of her attacks on the takeover plan, she dismissed the idea of a city manager with powers greater than those of elected officials. That, she said, was the idea that sank the takeover plan, and she was not about to accept it in this new form. "Let me tell you," Ms. Faison said, "I will reach out to anyone who is willing to help the city of Camden, but I will not let anyone take my rights as an elected official away from me."
Last summer, state officials said that waiting for the cooperation of city officials, after a decade of fruitless state fiscal supervision, was pointless. They spoke of a city administration whose budget numbers were like quicksand, and of the need for a clean break with the past as the only way to create the conditions in which upright citizens could come forward to serve.
So assiduous was the state's groundwork in preparing the way for a takeover that Trenton even got an endorsement from the city's black ministers, as deeply aware as any of the civil rights implications of a white Republican administration in Trenton superseding minority-group elected officials at home. But they despaired of any other way to move the city forward.
Today, Commissioner Kenny characterized the takeover bill as a kind of stick used on local leaders to get their attention. Now, she said, her department is working with state legislators, including Senator Wayne R. Bryant, a Camden Democrat and leader of the antitakeover forces, to work out a new approach, one presumably based on today's blueprint, with the separation of powers at City Hall still to be worked out.
Besides proposing measures like a wage freeze and some givebacks in benefits, the new plan calls for some new taxes to help close Camden's budget gap, and to help the state shift millions of its dollars from balancing Camden's budget to paying off the city's long-term debt.

HEADLINE: British Airways Chief Ready to Make Broad Changes

BYLINE: By SUZANNE KAPNER

DATELINE: LONDON, Nov. 22

 BODY:
When the subject of the Singapore Airlines crash in Taiwan came up during a recent gathering of British Airways executives, the chief executive, Rod Eddington, stunned colleagues by going into a detailed technical analysis of what happened to the plane, right down to its takeoff speed, people who were present said.
Mr. Eddington, who became chief executive at British Airways on May 1, has been praised for being able to find his way around a cockpit as easily as through a balance sheet. Since he took over, the price of British Airways shares has increased about 10 percent as the company returned to profitability from a loss last year. 
 Some of the new strategies were put in place by Mr. Eddington's predecessor, Robert Ayling. Soon, however, Mr. Eddington will have a chance to show his real mettle. Within the next two weeks, he is expected to announce broad changes at British Airways aimed at eliminating the 300 million ($425 million) in losses the airline incurred last year on short-haul routes, people close to the company said.
At the same time, British Airways is reassessing its alliance strategy after its unsuccessful attempt to merge with KLM Royal Dutch Airways. One outcome could have British Airways going back to the regulators in hopes of receiving antitrust immunity for its alliance with American Airlines, company executives said.
But first, Mr. Eddington plans to reverse one of his predecessor's longstanding policies of relying on Gatwick Airport as part of a hub-and-spoke system with London's other international airport, Heathrow. As such, Gatwick handled short-haul transfer travel and long-haul routes, but it failed to build enough traffic to cover costs. Last year, operations at the airport lost 40 million ($57 million) before overhead. As a result, British Airways will leave the transfer market and will shift long-haul routes back to Heathrow, leaving Gatwick to focus on short-haul city-to-city service, people close to the company's planning said.
To further bolster profitability, British Airways plans to consolidate operations at Gatwick by combining its European operations there with CityFlyer Express, a wholly owned franchisee, these people continued.
British Airways is also expected to streamline its short-haul franchise network of a dozen or so carriers, these people said. As part of that process, the airline has already said it will sell Go, its low-cost carrier.
Steve Double, a spokesman for British Airways, declined to comment on the proposed changes.
"Gatwick is strategically important for them," said Chris Tarry, an analyst with Commerzbank Securities. "This is all about getting the right cost base."
Next on Mr. Eddington's list will be the alliance strategy. After the collapse of the proposed merger with KLM, British Airways reopened discussions first begun in April with Delta Air Lines and Air France to join their SkyTeam alliance, but those talks have since been abandoned, people close to the negotiations said.
Instead, British Airways will try to strengthen its OneWorld alliance with American Airlines, part of the AMR Corporation. "We could go back to regulators with a revamped proposal in the next 6 to 12 months," said Andrew Sentance, British Airway's chief economist.
British Airways would probably assert that the competitive landscape has changed vastly since the two airlines first approached regulators, in 1996, Mr. Sentance added. Then, there were fewer direct flights to the United States from Continental Europe, so most European passengers had to transfer at Heathrow, giving British Airways a disproportionate share of that market.
Today, increased competition on those routes is causing British Airways to leave the transfer market, where losses have piled up.
Moreover, British Airways said it was facing tougher competition on its home turf, where the Star Alliance, a group of 15 international airlines that includes Air Canada, Lufthansa, United Airlines and British Midland, commands 25 percent of traffic at Heathrow, making it a close second to British Airways' 36 percent share.
It is unclear whether these arguments would sway the regulators in Washington, who have withheld antitrust immunity until the United States and Britain sign a new aviation treaty that would open Heathrow to more United States airlines.
In the meantime, two rival alliances, one made up of United, which is a unit of the UAL Corporation, and Lufthansa, and the other one between Northwest Airlines and KLM, have been granted antitrust immunity. That permits them to share crucial pricing and traffic information, and it has helped them win customers away from British Airways.

It Makes the World Go Round, Among Some Other Things

BYLINE: By ANNA KISSELGOFF

 BODY:
"Looking at Love . . . ," which may sound like a magazine title, was what the New York City Ballet called the benefit opening of its fall-winter season at the New York State Theater on Tuesday night.
Under the company's current formula, a five-week run of "The Nutcracker" (starting tomorrow) is sandwiched between this gala and the two-month repertory run that begins in January. 
 What then, to devise for a single evening that requires a theme for a dinner and a performance intended to raise money and be brief enough for hungry donors?
The idea that the company would explore facets of love embedded in a wide range of its usual ballets sounded like something of stretch. But Peter Martins, City Ballet's artistic director, managed to, yes, stretch a gimmick into an ingeniously arranged program of excerpts.
"Looking at Love . . ." did what it promised. The structure was shrewd, beginning with the virginal symbol of the 16-year-old Princess Aurora meeting princely suitors in "The Sleeping Beauty" and ending with the triple wedding of George Balanchine's "Midsummer Night's Dream."
Love was not necessarily romance. The program varied more classical excerpts with contemporary jagged images of the battle of the sexes. If love meant women were saying they were sorry in the first half of the evening, by the end they gave as good as they got.
Balanchine kept his women on a pedestal, Jerome Robbins sometimes put them on the floor. Mr. Martins and William Forsythe, the American director of the Frankfurt Ballet, belong to a younger generation and kept their combatants equal. Fourteen ballets were represented by 15 excerpts ("Dream" had 2); the evening's conductor was Hugo Fiorato.
Bits and pieces do not show the depth of a first-rank company like City Ballet, but the striking aspect of this array was the innovative range of movement in the choreography. The genius of Balanchine, the company's founder with Lincoln Kirstein, was represented in this respect by the economy of gesture and feeling in an experimental ballet like the Stravinsky "Duo Concertant" and the neo-Romantic extremes (a woman carried laterally) of his luscious Brahms ballet, "Liebeslieder Walzer."
Mr. Martins's 1991 staging of "The Sleeping Beauty" was represented by an abbreviated first act led by Margaret Tracey's subdued Aurora.
A change of pace came with Balanchine's ode to big-city romance in "The Man I Love" duet from his Gershwin ballet, "Who Cares?" Janie Taylor offered a less sophisticated image than others have in the role but her purity was not at odds with Nilas Martins's jazz-age gallantry. The final duet of Robbins's "In the Night," turns its Chopin music, played by Cameron Grant, into a turbulent quarrel that Jenifer Ringer and James Fayette filled with the stunning passion of their dancing.
Jennie Somogyi, a teen-age hipster bouncing around a falsely indifferent Jared Angle, danced an excerpt from Peter Martins's "Waltz Project." Other comic relief came from the torrid duet in Balanchine's "Slaughter on Tenth Avenue" with Helene Alexopoulos in fine bump-and-grind form to seduce a good-natured Damian Woetzel.
At the other emotional extreme, there was touching performance by Alexandra Ansanelli as a doll who accepts a paper heart from a toy soldier, strongly characterized by Tom Gold in Balanchine's miniature Bizet ballet, "The Steadfast Tin Soldier."
The eccentric duet that ends Mr. Forsythe's "Herman Schmerman," danced to Thom Willems's electronic score, received full value from Wendy Whelan and Albert Evans. No need to ask why they both wear short yellow skirts. One has only to appreciate the off-balance images of love on a precipice.
Not every excerpt was a pas de deux. Monique Meunier was a charmer in the chatterbox solo from Robbins's "Dances at a Gathering," as three men passed her by. Kyra Nichols was delicious as a Titania in love with Kipling Houston as the donkey in "Dream."
The updated apache dance that Mr. Martins devised for Maria Kowroski and Charles Askegard in "Them Twos" was sensationally danced. A brief comic scene from Robbins's "Concert" featured Robert La Fosse as the henpecked husband and his spouse, Melissa Walter. The nicely ridiculous was followed by the sublime images of love and loss that Yvonne Borree and Nikolaj Hubbe rendered perfectly in "Duo Concertant."
Darci Kistler and Philip Neal, as well as Miranda Weese and Jock Soto, offered a glimpse of the drawing-room love stories in the first act of "Liebeslieder Walzer." The dream ballet from Robbins's "West Side Story Suite" seemed like too much schmaltz right after, but Mendelssohn and Balanchine reconciled all lovers on a higher plane at the close.

Unions Pushing to Organize Thousands of Amazon.com Workers

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Seeking to exploit a major retailer's vulnerability during the holiday season, the labor movement has begun a broad campaign to unionize thousands of workers at Amazon.com in what is labor's most ambitious foray into the new economy.
The Washington Alliance of Technology Workers, an arm of the Communications Workers of America, is seeking to organize 400 of the company's customer-service workers in Seattle. At the same time, the United Food and Commercial Workers Union and an independent organizing group are seeking to unionize more than 5,000 workers at the eight distribution centers across the country used by Amazon. 
 With unions representing only a handful of workers in high-technology companies, the Amazon campaign is by far labor's biggest enlistment effort in the fastest- growing sector of the economy.
"This is an important way for labor to enter the new millennium," said Duane Stillwell, president of the Prewitt Organizing Fund, a new independent group that is seeking to work with several unions to organize Amazon's distribution workers. "This is a labor force that unions need to get next to. Amazon is obviously the leader in the Internet e-retailing economy, and as they go, so goes the industry."
Labor leaders say the time is ripe to unionize Amazon because many of its workers are complaining about mandatory preholiday overtime and the way their stock options have plummeted in value.
Union organizers say they hope that if enough Amazon workers put their support behind unionizing during the Christmas rush, management's fears of disruption might cause it to grant union recognition or grant concessions making it easier for workers to unionize.
Amazon is fiercely resisting the organizing drive, saying that its employees, who are given stock options, are owners of the company and in no way need a union.
"Obviously we don't feel that having a union at Amazon will benefit our employees, our customers or Amazon as a whole," said Patty Smith, an Amazon spokeswoman. The company. which is based in Seattle, expects revenue of more than $2 billion this year, but has yet to make a profit.
At a distribution center in Fernley, Nev., last week, Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief executive, spoke out against the unionization drive in a pep talk to employees putting in large amounts of preholiday overtime.
"I'm not concerned it will disrupt the holidays," he said. "Everyone in this company is an owner. We don't need unions in Amazon.com."
Low-key unionization efforts began at Amazon two years ago, but they did not get far, largely because workers were delighted with their stock options and saw huge opportunities for promotion. At that time, Amazon's growth seemed boundless and its stock price was four times its current level of $25.19.
But the unionization campaign has gained some traction this fall because the stock has sputtered and many employees think less about promotions than about possible layoffs, having seen the company lay off 150 workers last January. Amazon recently began using more than 100 customer-service representatives in New Delhi, causing the Seattle representatives to fret that they will be laid off in favor of the Indian workers, who are paid far less.
Last week in Seattle, 50 customer-service representatives who support unionization went public with their effort. Their aim is to get a majority of the 400 customer-service workers in Seattle to sign cards before Christmas saying they favor unionizing.
Several union supporters said they hoped that Amazon might be so eager to keep operations running smoothly during the Christmas rush that it might quickly grant them union recognition.
"The work these people are doing shatters the myth that high-tech workers don't want a union," said Marcus Courtney, co-founder of the Washington Alliance of Technology Workers.
Many of the customer-service representatives complain that their wages, which usually run from $11 to $15 an hour, are too low for them to live well in high-cost Seattle. They also complain that they often receive little notice about schedule changes and having to work overtime. Several workers said that after working so much overtime they had tired of Mr. Bezos's mantra that it is Day 1 and Amazon is a start-up in which workers need to work hard.
"Our ownership feels hollow," said Kirk Sheldon, a 25-year-old customer service worker in Seattle. "They always say they are willing to hear our input, but there isn't follow-through. The inaction is the root of why we're organizing."
Officials from the food and commercial workers' union and the Prewitt fund said that over the next few weeks several dozen organizers would distribute fliers and collect signatures at Amazon warehouses in Delaware, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky and Nevada. Until two weeks ago, the union and the Prewitt fund were working together on organizing the warehouse workers, but their cooperative efforts have fallen apart.
Greg Denier, a spokesman for the food and commercial workers, said many Amazon warehouse workers were eager to join unions because they were upset with overtime, with their wages of $7 to $9.50 an hour and with the way they were treated.
"Amazon may be the symbol of the new economy, but it has the worst of the working conditions of the old economy," he said.

HEADLINE: Fox Follows Up on Pledge Of Diverse Mexican Cabinet

BYLINE: By GINGER THOMPSON

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Nov. 22

 BODY:
Following on his promise to build a government that is representative of his country's 100 million men and women, President-elect Vicente Fox Quesada began announcing today the names of an eclectic mix of people who will be in his cabinet.
Among those whose appointments were announced at a packed news conference in an elegant 18th-century European arts museum were economists, a well-known Latin America author, a banker, an environmentalist, the president of a company that manages Mexican tourist resorts and a former governor. 
 The resumes of the cabinet members indicate that they have all distinguished themselves in their respective professions. But several have little or no political experience, a fact that many people find refreshing but makes some a little nervous.
Leticia Navarro, a cosmetics company executive who was named tourism secretary, acknowledged in her acceptance speech that she was such an unknown that a newspaper article had called her "the incognito secretary."
Mr. Fox, who will take office on Dec. 1 and is the first politician in 71 years to wrest the presidency from the long-governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, seemed to revel in the moment.
"Above all," he said, "we want this to be a citizen government. So that you working woman, housewife, you professional, you peasant farmer, land owner, worker, adolescent, child or elderly will make your voices heard and will help us move our country forward."
Among those whose appointments were announced yesterday were Francisco Gil Diaz, general director of a long-distance telephone business, Avantel, as treasury secretary. Luis Ernesto Derbez, a former economist at the World Bank who had posts around the world, was named economy secretary, at a new ministry that will take over the responsibilities of the former Commerce Ministry.
Jorge G. Castaneda, a Latin America scholar and author, will follow in his father's footsteps and be foreign minister. A former supporter of left-wing causes, Mr. Castaneda later became one of the world's foremost scholars on the Latin American left. He had been tied to Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, a left-wing leader in Mexico, until the early 1990's and opposed Nafta during the years of negotiations.
"Fox has built from early on a broad coalition of voters, sympathizers and advisers, and he wanted that initial broad coalition that took him to the presidency represented in his government," Mr. Castaneda said in an interview. "I am a reflection of that commitment."
In his acceptance speech today, Mr. Castaneda said he intended to make foreign policy more inclusive and supportive of all Mexicans and reiterated his commitment to provide greater support to the hundreds of thousands of Mexicans who migrate each year to the United States.
"Businessmen seeking to generate export opportunities and flows of foreign investment will find they have friends in the Foreign Ministry," he said. "So will artists and writers that work to promote culture and art around the world. And above all, so will those Mexican workers that have felt forced to abandon their homes and their country."
Among others whose appointments were announced were the former governor, Ernesto Ruffo, as czar of the northern border. When Mr. Ruffo, of the conservative National Action Party, was elected governor of Baja California in 1989, he became the first opposition politician to win such a post in recent history.
An airline executive, Ernesto Martens Rebolledo, 67, was appointed energy secretary. The agriculture secretary will be Javier Usabiaga Arroyo, known in his home state of Guanajuato as the King of Garlic because his family business has grown into the region's chief garlic exporter. The environment secretary will be Victor Lichtinger, former executive director of a trilateral environmental commission created by the United States, Canada and Mexico under the North American Free Trade Agreement.
And Eduardo Sojo Garza-Aldape, an economist, was named coordinator of public policy advisers. Educated at the University of Pennsylvania, Mr. Sojo was the president-elect's chief economic adviser when Mr. Fox was governor of Guanajuato.
"All of us in the new government carry the same banner for change," Mr. Sojo said. "But change is very abstract if it does not take hold in the daily chores of each public servant."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
No matter who's the next president, there will be some hard choices to make.

BYLINE: By Jeff Madrick; This column appears here every Thursday. Jeff Madrick is the editor of Challenge Magazine and a new collection of essays, "Unconventional Wisdom: Alternative Perspectives on the New Economy." Mr. Madrick, Virginia Postrel, Alan B. Krueger and Hal R. Varian rotate as contributors.

 BODY:
ONE piece of conventional wisdom making the rounds these days is that investors in the financial markets may prefer the Washington gridlock that a close presidential election brings. No new policy is good policy, the argument goes. But circumstances are shifting rapidly, and such a view seems especially naive right now.
The presidential campaign was fought over how to distribute the spoils of prosperity, but the new president will face different economic conditions from those expected only a few months ago. The pace of economic growth is slowing significantly, and some economists are beginning to discuss the possibility of recession in 2001. The unemployment rate could rise, and the projected budget surplus could dissipate. Moreover, the record trade deficit and unusually high value of the dollar, which so many economists have brushed aside as unimportant, could well tie the hands of the nation's policy makers. 
 The case for slower growth begins with falling stock prices and rising oil prices. Both are inhibiting consumer and corporate spending and raising the costs of doing business. But it does not end there. With individual and corporate debt so high, any slowdown in the growth of income can result in cutbacks in spending to meet debt service payments. After having invested so much in information technology, business may also be nearing the saturation point, and consumers appear to be slowing their buying of personal computers.
The evidence is, of course, not conclusive, but retail sales in general, and auto sales in particular, weakened this fall; housing leveled off; capital spending slowed; and profits were disappointing at many companies, including high-technology leaders like Dell Computer.
Prosperity breeds complacency, however, and the view of many forecasters is that if the economy unwinds rapidly, the Federal Reserve can always save the day by reducing interest rates. But such rate reductions had more impact when rates were higher. It will take a considerable cut in rates from today's relatively low levels to stimulate the quantity of mortgage and state debt refinancings that provided so much buying power in the 1990's, when such rates hit 8 and 9 percent.
The only resort may well be fiscal stimulus, from either tax cuts or more federal spending. Odds are still against a recession, but the long-time Wall Street economist Albert Wojnilower, now with Monitor-Clipper Partners, says that without such stimulus, he thinks a recession is in the cards.
At this point, presidential leadership of a high order will be required. A nation long educated to fear federal budget deficits may resist fiscal stimulus when it is needed. The bond markets may also punish any fiscally oriented president with higher rates. The new president will have to convince the public, the financial markets and the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, that fiscal stimulus is in order.
My guess is that a slowing economy will open minds to a tax cut. And some traditional liberals, like Max Sawicky, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, find themselves, paradoxically, acknowledging that George W. Bush may be in a better position than Al Gore to advocate more stimulative policies, even if it threatens a new federal deficit. Vice President Gore has been especially adamant about the need to balance the federal budget and pay off part of the national debt every year.
But the kind of tax cuts undertaken also matters. One that mostly benefits the wealthy, like the one proposed by Mr. Bush, will largely be channeled into savings, not the needed spending.
What will probably be forgotten in all this is that fiscal stimulus can also result from more government spending. The nation, in my view, will be better served by a more generous earned-income tax credit, to take one example, than by a large tax cut. The new economy also presents new demands that only government investment can meet either directly or through subsidies -- like more accessible child care, improved and continuing education and flexible work hours. Such spending has the dual benefit of stimulating growth and raising the long-term potential of the economy.
But the new president will face a further deterrent to sensible policies. Because of its record trade deficit, America is not entirely the master of its own fate. The current expansion is being financed by a huge inflow of foreign capital as America buys much more from overseas producers than it sells abroad.
If domestic growth falters, however, investors may have second thoughts. As the dollar falls, because of the sliding stock market and the pullout of investors, it could precipitate still more capital flight. And the falling dollar would be inflationary, pushing up import prices and probably persuading the Fed that to attract foreign investors it has to keep interest rates higher than it would otherwise. This would make a slowing economy still weaker -- and could push a merely weak economy into recession.
Once again, many analysts are complacent. Some argue that the dollar will hold its value because, if the American economy weakens, international investors will have nowhere else to go with their money as their economies will also sputter. But Rosemary Sagar, a managing director at U.S. Trust, has her doubts.
She notes that Europe as a whole is less dependent on exports to the United States than is generally thought. Also, stimulative tax cuts have been enacted across Europe that will not be entirely offset by government spending reductions. And European interest in acquisitions in the United States, a main source of capital inflow, is diminishing. In sum, Ms. Sagar says, the dollar is likely to fall as the gap between growth rates and interest rates in the United States and Europe narrows.
Events are conspiring to make the new administration a more difficult one than the campaigning implied. Far from simply allocating the benefits of rapid economic growth, the next president may have to persuade a hesitant nation to adopt fiscal stimulus while persuading the Fed not to offset it with higher interest rates. He will have to persuade foreigners that America is still the place to invest even as the economy grows more slowly. A sharply falling dollar could spur a financial crisis. Ideally, he will apportion fiscal stimulus intelligently among tax cuts, social programs and public investment.
For all the sly rhetoric to the contrary, the president does indeed matter.

HEADLINE: The $4,800 Handbag Under the Tree;
Another Jolly Season for Luxury Goods

BYLINE: By LESLIE KAUFMAN

 BODY:
While most Americans would be content with a Sony Playstation 2 or a sweater twin set under the tree, for an increasing number of people mere cashmere does not say "I love you" with quite the same authority as pashmina. Accustomed to luxury, these new-economy swells expect the most expensive version of everything -- and are likely to get it.
The economy may be slowing and lots of dot-com stock options are underwater, but the top slice of income earners is still sitting on a huge pile of wealth and their free-flowing extravagance is expected to propel such top purveyors of gilded baubles and designer delectables as Tiffany & Company, Neiman Marcus Group and LVMH-Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton into yet another banner financial year. 
 Luxury goods are not, of course, necessarily expensive in absolute terms, but they almost by definition cost more than the same products by other makers. It is, for example, just as possible to buy a $20 silk tie as a $75 version.
But high price is part of the appeal, and these products are designed to muddle the sub-lobe of the brain that makes cost-benefit calculations. The darkly lustrous eye powders of Chanel or an elegant, logo-encrusted satchel by Louis Vuitton seduce in ways cheaper alternatives cannot: they cost more, but who can put a price tag on that one accessory that makes one feel, for an instant, Vanderbilt-rich or Sophia-Loren-glam?
In moments of reflection, every affluent shopper suspects that there is as much art as substance in the difference between a Revlon lipstick bought at the drugstore for $8 and the By Terry counterpart from Saks Fifth Avenue, going for $49. And that the margin between an Omega Speedmaster, which usually retails at well over $3,000, and a $65 Timex i-Control model is as attributable to vanity as to quality.
But since nothing would be quite so deflating for this fantasy business as for a customer to discover that a life-transforming cosmetic was actually mass produced on a factory floor for $2 (the average industry price for lipstick), luxury-goods companies guard no secret more ferociously than the cost of making their wares.
Of course, the shopper willing to buy 1.7 ounces of Sisley Paris's anti-aging cream ($300 at Neiman Marcus) or the book-size black nylon Prada knapsack ($570 at Prada stores) -- the essential carry-on for East Hampton socialites last summer -- does not worry much about how much it costs to make the product. And anyway, your average design-house executive would run a marathon in her Manolo Blahniks before coughing up that classified information. "We are uncomfortable even with the question," said Christina Kim, a spokeswoman for Hermes of Paris, whose Kelly handbags (medium size) sell for $4,800 at the Madison Avenue boutique.
In truth, many luxury products offer a level of craftsmanship, materials and service that are steps above what is available for even expensive mass-produced wares. Most high-end leather makers, from Coach to Escada, promise to repair and maintain their products for life. They also provide other subtle guarantees to the acutely style-conscious -- making bags, for example, in the same shapes year after year, ensuring that a $500 investment today will be chic 10 years later.
Nicole Miller ties can retail for $75 apiece. The cost, said a spokeswoman, Meredith Wollins, is partly because of original work by the company's graphics team that is then hand screened onto the silk in Asia. The By Terry line of lipsticks uses particularly expensive pigments and manufactures only small batches, which, naturally, raises the price.
Then there is the intangible element of art. "The talent to achieve excellence is something you cannot put a price on," said Christiana Monfardini, an Escada spokeswoman.
Theoretically, that might be true, but if one insists on putting a price on luxury, enough of the industry's secrets have leaked out that it is possible to gain a little enlightenment.
Public companies have to report gross margins -- the money they take in after the costs of making their goods are deducted. For a well-run luxury company like Gucci or LVMH or a cosmetic giant like Estee Lauder, that number usually runs in excess of (sometimes well in excess of) 60 percent of total revenue. That means the actual cost of making their stuff, from sweaters to thigh-high leather boots, is less than 40 percent of the average price tag. (By contrast, gross margins at the Gap and other well-run chain apparel stores rarely rise above 45 percent.)
The spread widens when Gucci and other luxury-goods makers sell directly to the public and reap retail prices. "The gross margins for brands with their own stores are even better than that," said Dana Cohen, a stock analyst who keeps close track of the luxury sector for Banc of America Securities. Sales per square foot at Gucci stores run in the range of $3,000 a year, Ms. Cohen says, as opposed to $300 a square foot at a midprice department store.
To be fair, there are very real expenses that will cut the final net profit on luxury products: advertising, fabulous parties to create buzz, rents on the fanciest boulevards in the most pricey cities and salaries to the fine-boned sales clerks who speak in charming foreign accents, to name a few. But do those outlays for image really change the intrinsic worth of the product? Suffice it to say that fine minds differ.
Besides, despite these marketing and retail costs, net profits are rising rapidly for luxury goods companies. In September, LVMH announced a 31 percent increase in operating profit for the first half of the year, on $4.24 billion in sales. At the end of October, Tiffany & Company said earnings had risen 73 percent in the first three quarters of 2000 on sales of a little over $1 billion. And when the Neiman Marcus Group completed its fiscal year at the end of July, it boasted of earnings growth of 36 percent on revenue of $2.85 billion, a 13.5 percent increase over the previous year.
Now, not all luxury products yield 70 percent margins. Certain types do even better. Among the most prodigious earners are watches, cosmetics (skin creams in particular), jewelry and accessories like handbags and scarves, because there are finite costs of production and almost no ceiling on what customers will pay.
One longtime skin care industry consultant (who insisted that she not be identified), recently helped a client company develop a new night cream. She said the basic cost for the cream itself, which contained relatively expensive raw ingredients, was roughly $4.50 for 1.7 ounces; the jar and cap cost $2.30 and the box 40 cents. In stores, the cream will retail for $36 -- or more than four times what it cost to produce.
That is reasonable, she argues, considering the other costs the manufacturer will encounter bringing it to market, like shipping and advertising. But although she believes the quality of products on the market varies vastly depending on the quality of their ingredients, the thought of skin creams selling for hundreds of dollars makes her laugh. "There is a point at which it gets silly," she conceded.
And as sensationally profitable as categories like cosmetics and accessories can be, most luxury houses have at least one other blockbuster that is a deep, proficient well of cash.
For example, one high-placed executive at a brand-name luxury house explained the rough cost of producing a high-quality leather handbag. The finest leather from an Italian (only!) tannery, depending on the exchange rate, costs $50 to $60, or about 30 percent of the bag's manufacturing cost. The labor of a master craftsman to cut individual pieces (sometimes as many as seven) and stitch the bag is about 40 percent of its cost, roughly $72. The specially manufactured metal hardware, like the logo and locks, might account for another 25 percent of the cost, or $45. Add another 5 percent for miscellaneous costs, and all in all there is $180 worth of bag.
And that stays the same, this executive says, whether you are paying $460 for Escada's new handbag in turquoise leather or $4,800 for that forest green Hermes Kelly handbag that is so frequently out of stock.
Margins are even better for bags made out of cheaper materials like nylon or canvas (though import duties on mixed fabrics can be steep).
The Louis Vuitton canvas luggage line, for example, is classic and beloved. But, says the executive, who works for a rival company, the cost of canvas is pennies on the dollar compared with leather, and canvas can be machine-cut en masse, thus radically saving on labor costs. Working in canvas might reduce manufacturing costs by $100. Still, a simple 13 by 7 inch canvas satchel from Louis Vuitton retails for $520 -- or more than the leather Escada bag.
A Vuitton spokeswoman disputes the calculation, but declined to provide details of her own. In a statement, the company said: "We at Louis Vuitton pride ourselves on the high quality of all our bags as well as our high standards of production. For one canvas bag, numerous factors go into costs: the quality of the canvas, the best pieces of skin for the leather trimmings, hand-stitching and the cost of labor, as well as the product development that is involved in its design. All these elements contribute to the final retail cost of the bag, which is calculated to maintain an excellent value for the price."
The company also sent a video of its production facilities in response to the same set of questions. "To see the quality that goes into our bags you should come to a factory in person," the spokeswoman said. "It is like a museum."
Undoubtedly. A museum, that is, with a steep admission price that many are willing to pay.

HEADLINE: Claims for Unemployment Insurance Benefits Turn Upward

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 22

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing new claims for state unemployment insurance unexpectedly edged up last week, suggesting that the economy's hunger for an ever-increasing supply of new workers is easing.
The Labor Department reported today that new claims for jobless benefits rose by 7,000, to a seasonally adjusted 336,000, for the week ended Saturday. Many economists had forecast a drop in claims. 
 "The numbers are in line with the fact that the economy is slowing somewhat," said Clifford Waldman of Waldman Associates. "Although the labor market is still fairly strong in terms of the overall hiring situation, we're starting to see some pockets of softness."
Economists said auto-plant furloughs helped push last week's claims higher. Manufacturers have temporarily shut down plants or scaled back production to trim inventories because sales are slowing.
The Federal Reserve, which raised interest rates six times starting in June 1999 to brake the roaring economy enough to keep inflation in check, left monetary policy steady last week because evidence is accumulating that the economy is no longer in danger of overheating.
"Jobless claims are at their highest level in two years, indicating that the economy has moderated," said Karen Dexter, an economist at Merrill Lynch. Economic growth slowed considerably in the third quarter, to an annual rate of 2.7 percent, less than half the sizzling 5.6 percent rate registered in the second quarter.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Shares Fall on Fears That Technology Growth May Slow

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

 BODY:
Stocks resumed their broad slide yesterday in a session that experienced sudden shifts in response to the legal battle over Florida's presidential vote and felt the weight of concerns about the profits of technology companies.
The Nasdaq composite index tumbled 116.11 points, or 4 percent, to 2,755.34, its fifth consecutive loss and the 11th in 13 trading sessions since the Friday before Election Day. The latest Nasdaq decline swelled its loss for the year to 32.3 percent. It has plunged 45.4 percent from its record high on March 10. 
 But in contrast to Tuesday's action, the other main gauges declined as well, with the loss of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index -- a widely used benchmark for the market as a whole -- reaching 10 percent for the year.
"We continue to hang on every word that's coming out of Florida," said Andrew M. Brooks, chief trader at T. Rowe Price in Baltimore.
Indeed, after reacting negatively to the overnight ruling that hand-recounted ballots from predominantly Democratic counties must be tallied, raising hopes in the camp of Vice President Al Gore, the market briefly regained some ground on word favorable to Gov. George W. Bush that Miami-Dade County had halted its recount.
The S.& P. 500 shed 24.99 points, or 1.9 percent, to 1,322.36, as 350 of its components fell and 130 rose. Cisco, General Electric and Intel were the biggest drags. Coca-Cola, which ended talks to buy Quaker Oats, rose $4.38, to $59.63, and was the biggest positive factor. Quaker dropped $7.44, to $87. Brokerage stocks were among the weakest of nontechnology groups, but drugs and airlines were also weak and even utilities, a traditional haven, failed to gain.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 95.18 points, or 0.9 percent, to 10,399.32. It is down 9.6 percent so far this year. Boeing was its biggest drag, losing $3.50, to $65.13, after gaining $3.06 on Tuesday.
Drug and other health-related stocks were among those most sensitive to the election news, along with Philip Morris.
But analysts also pointed to other factors than election uncertainty as weighing on investors. While the two-week stalemate is "no doubt a factor," said Frederick Taylor, vice chairman and chief investment officer for the United States Trust Company, the market is suffering from a meltdown in valuation of the high-technology sector.
"What we're having is a change in leadership," he said, with value stocks and those of lesser size gaining favor at the expense of growth stocks, many of which still carry high price-to-earnings multiples. And as the economy slows, technology companies are spending less money to buy components and other equipment from others in the field, creating a ripple effect that Mr. Taylor said used to be called an inventory correction.
The overall portfolio damage continues to mount. According to Wilshire Associates, investors lost $1.25 trillion from the close on Election Day through Tuesday, and the Wilshire 5000 index lost an additional 251.36 points yesterday, equal to $289 billion.
"We have seen steeper two-week declines," said Tom Stevens, a senior Wilshire official, "but this is among the more precipitous." He called the election uncertainty a significant "contributing factor."
But some analysts remained upbeat. "The cash is piling up," said Donald G. Berdine, chief investment officer for PNC Advisors in Pittsburgh. When the election is resolved, he predicted, "either way we'd get a good relief rally, maybe 200-300 points in the Dow the day after we have a decision."
On the New York Stock Exchange, volume was a hefty 981.2 million shares, with declining issues outpacing advancing ones by 1,838 to 939.

Treasury Prices Gain
 (By The Associated Press) -- Bond prices advanced again yesterday as stocks continued to slide on worries about a slowing economy and the unresolved presidential election.
The price of the 10-year Treasury note rose 7/32, to 100 31/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.62 percent from 5.65 percent on Tuesday. The 30-year bond rose 25/32, to 108 6/32. Its yield fell to 5.68 percent from 5.73 percent. The market, which closed early in advance of Thanksgiving, will be closed today and reopen for another abbreviated session tomorrow.

HEADLINE: U.N. Envoy Voices Worry On U.S. Image

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 22

 BODY:
With barely a month to go until a decision on an American request to pay lower dues to the United Nations, Ambassador Richard C. Holbrooke said he was afraid that his yearlong campaign for the cuts could be stalled by nations that think no one is in charge in the United States.
In an interview on Tuesday, Mr. Holbrooke said that to counter the impression that the United States government is somehow frozen in crisis while presidential votes are being recounted in Florida, he will invite a series of high-ranking members of Congress to the United Nations to keep the issue of budget reforms alive. 
 If no action is taken on American requests for lower payments, Mr. Holbrooke said, a recently improving attitude in Washington toward the United Nations, marked by larger allocations of money, could quickly reverse.
"If we don't get reform, we're going to run the risk that the Congress will start reducing the U.N. money again," he said.
Among the leading politicians planning to visit New York are: Senator Joseph R. Biden, the Delaware Democrat who is the ranking minority member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee; John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia, chairman of the Armed Services Committee; and Gordon Smith, an Oregon Republican and member of the budget and foreign relations committees.
Mr. Holbrooke said that staff members representing Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina and Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman, will also visit. Mr. Helms, a leading critic of the United Nations, has been ill and cannot make the trip, officials said.
"There's no question that there will be a concerted push for delay at the U.N.," Mr. Holbrooke said, "led by countries that don't wish to see any change because they might have to pay more, and who will argue that in a climate of political uncertainty the U.N. should wait for the United States to settle its affairs and get a new administration.
"We're arguing exactly the opposite: that the U.N. should present the new Congress and the new administration with a reform package on three elements."
The three elements that Mr. Holbrooke, under Congressional pressure, has been seeking to change are the size of American payments to the regular United Nations budget, to the peacekeeping fund and to the operations of the peacekeeping department itself.
On all three issues, the United States has met resistance from a range of nations, sometimes for different reasons. Many diplomats predict that American dues will not be reduced unless a majority of nations decide that further alienating American critics of the United Nations would be foolhardy. Most of the strongest critics are Republicans.
Part of the problem with the battle for reduced American dues is that diplomats here and politicians in Washington are not seeing the dispute in the same terms. Americans portray their goal as an overall revamping of all United Nations assessments. Peacekeeping assessments, for example, are operating on a 28-year-old scale widely acknowledged to be out of date. Many countries have become richer since then -- nations like Singapore, Brazil and the major oil-producers -- and are therefore able to pay more.
But at the United Nations, the bid for new American assessments is viewed as the spectacle of the world's richest country seeking to avoid paying assessments commensurate with its share of world economic output.
Mr. Holbrooke said this argument was fallacious. He pointed out that the United States had never been assessed regular budget dues equal to its share of world output, beginning in 1946, when Americans had a 50.7 percent share of the world economy and were assessed 39.89 percent of the United Nations budget.
Peacekeeping presents a separate problem because the United States is assessed 30 percent of peacekeeping costs but has been paying only 25 percent since the mid-1990's, thereby automatically increasing its peacekeeping debt yearly.
Mr. Holbrooke said what was lost in this dispute over dues was the size of voluntary American contributions beyond dues, to all United Nations programs and agencies. He estimated the United States' contributions in the 2001 fiscal year at $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion.
The disparity of the estimate relates to an unrelated dispute holding up the combined budget appropriations for the Commerce, Justice and State departments and to Congressional demands for changes at the United Nations in return for money that has already been authorized.

HEADLINE: Company Is Told to Stay and Face New Union

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

 BODY:
The Quadrtech Corporation could have been just another company relocating to Mexico in search of cheaper wages and lower operating costs. But a federal judge, acting on a union complaint, has blocked the company's plans and ordered it to stay in California, a decision that has delighted union officials and worried manufacturers.
On Tuesday, a judge in the United States District Court in Los Angeles issued a preliminary injunction preventing Quadrtech, a small manufacturer of earrings and ear-piercing machines, from laying off 118 newly unionized workers and moving its manufacturing operations to Tijuana until labor complaints against it are resolved. 
 The company announced plans to move to Mexico one day after a branch of the Communications Workers of America was certified to represent workers at Quadrtech. Most of the employees are female immigrants from Mexico and other Latin American countries who assemble jewelry and are paid the state's minimum wage of $5.75 an hour.
Lawyers at the National Labor Relations Board, which petitioned the court on behalf of the workers, said this was the first time an American company trying to keep out a union had been prevented from leaving the United States.
"It's an eye opener," said Jaime Martinez, a union official who helped organize the California plant. "It's an issue that goes to the core of organizing the unorganized."
The judge's order comes at a time when footloose corporations and the formation of an economy that moves freely across borders with little or no concern for workers left behind have been publicly attacked in Seattle, in Washington and in other cities where international financial leaders gather to shape the world economy.
Experts said the case was certain to focus attention on what has become a common practice in the United States: employers using threats of relocation to keep workers from organizing unions or seeking higher wages.
"What's at issue here isn't the movement of a single plant but the future of collective bargaining as a viable institutional practice," said Harley Shaiken, a professor of labor and the global economy at the University of California at Berkeley. "If you can move a plant to avoid a union, you undermine the whole system, and if you move when you are involved in collective bargaining, you destroy the whole process."
The chairman of the National Association of Manufacturers, W. R. Timken Jr., said he foresaw trouble if the government and the courts intend to interfere in the business decisions of employers who seek to remain competitive.
"In the end, it's foolish to believe that any court can keep uncompetitive businesses captive by fiat," Mr. Timken said. "It just won't work."
Gregory Kennedy, the lawyer representing Vladimir Reil, the owner of Quadrtech, would not comment on the case. But in papers filed with the Federal District Court, Mr. Reil said the decision to move to Mexico was made for economic reasons.
In January, Mr. Reil transferred some equipment and dozens of workers from the plant of another company he owns, Onyx, in Harbor City, Calif., and opened Quadrtech in the Los Angeles suburb of Gardena.
But relations between management and the workers deteriorated quickly. After a work stoppage in May that the workers said was set off by the company's refusal to provide a chair for an ill worker, the employees began to organize.
A union vote was held in June, and the International Union of Electronic Workers, which later joined the C.W.A., was selected to represent the workers. The union was certified July 12. A day later, Mr. Kennedy told the union that Quadrtech would move to Mexico.
"We viewed that timing as more than mere coincidence," said James Small, assistant to the regional director of the National Labor Relations Board in Southern California. The union filed a complaint with the board after the relocation notice.
The board acted so quickly in this case, as opposed to others, because the violation of fair labor standards was so blatant, Mr. Small said.
Board investigators found that Quadrtech supervisors had told employees that the company was moving to Mexico because of the union vote, Mr. Small said. The board later established that the company had a history of anti-union actions, including threatening to fire workers who voted for the union, and telling workers the day before the election that Quadrtech would not be able to compete if it had to pay higher wages.
Kate Bronfenbrenner, director of labor education research at Cornell University, said implied or implicit threats to relocate have become a regular part of labor-management relations in the United States. She said she had conducted several national surveys of plant closings and had found that 68 percent of employers with manufacturing plants like Quadrtech's, which can pick up and move their operations, threaten to shut down or relocate in the face of union organizing campaigns.
"The more credible a threat," she said, "the more effective it is."
As global competitive pressures have increased, American manufacturers have shifted operations out of the United States to countries where wages are lower. Mexico has been a favorite destination, especially since the start of the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994. About 550,000 people were then employed in Mexican plants, called maquilladoras. along the border. Today, more than 1.3 million people work in border plants.
"It took 30 years to reach that first half-million jobs and only 6 years to double it," said Professor Shaiken of Berkeley. "Many of the plants and much of the employment increase in the maquilladoras results from U.S. firms shifting production to Mexico to take advantage of low wages, the lack of enforcement of labor and environmental standards, or both."
It appears that Quadrtech's threat to move was real. Weeks before the date the company scheduled for its relocation, Nov. 3, workers followed trucks taking equipment from Quadrtech to a warehouse in Tijuana, according to the board's investigation. When the employees tried to apply for work there, they were told the plant would open soon.
Because of the impending relocation, the labor relations board sidestepped its normal procedures and went to court to keep Quadrtech from moving while the legal complaint proceeded.
Barry J. Kearney, associate general counsel for the board's Division of Advice, said the board goes to court to block a few plant relocations every year, but they usually involve transfers within the United States.
Mr. Kearney said he had not heard of the procedure being used to block an out-of-country move "over the last 30 years."
In granting a preliminary injunction, Judge Carlos R. Moreno of the District Court for the Central District of California stated that the labor relations board has a "fair chance" of proving that Quadrtech intended to relocate not for economic reasons but to keep out the union, which is illegal. The judge ordered the company to bring back the equipment it had shipped to Mexico and to keep all workers employed until the complaint was resolved.
Lawyers said resolution of the case, including a trial before an administrative law judge and appeals, could easily take a year and a half.

HEADLINE: COUNTING THE VOTE: THE VICE PRESIDENT;
Gore Has Decided to Start Engines of His Transition

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE and JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 27

 BODY:
Over the summer, Vice President Al Gore quietly assigned his longtime adviser and former top aide, Roy Neel, to plan the transition from campaigning to governing.
Like the rest of the political world, Mr. Neel has been in limbo ever since, especially during the last two weeks as the outcome of the Nov. 7 election has remained up in the air. 
 But Tuesday night, bolstered by a favorable ruling by the Florida Supreme Court, Mr. Gore signaled for the first time that he would start the engines of his transition.
"Because we know now that this process is going to take more time, I believe it's now appropriate for both of us to focus on the transition," the vice president told the nation from his residence Tuesday night.
The Gore camp has been furious at Gov. George W. Bush for posing shortly after the election in an Oval Office-like setting and talking about his transition, including possible cabinet appointments, without having won the election. Mr. Gore has been careful to avoid a similar display, with aides saying a formal transition would be unnecessary for a man who has served as vice president for eight years and has been prepared, in their words, to assume the presidency from Day 1.
But with the clock ticking, Mr. Gore has been forced to focus on the task -- in part because of the practical need of a new president to fill 3,000 full-time jobs, and partly because of Mr. Gore's political needs. Because Mr. Gore ran "as my own man" and had so many separation issues with President Clinton, he cannot allow Clinton holdovers to become the face of his own administration.
"Gore can't afford to be the president of Clinton holdovers," said Paul Light, a transition scholar at the Brookings Institution. "It's not a sustainable political position."
Mr. Light said that Mr. Gore had a certain luxury in his transition that Mr. Bush did not have. He is already based in Washington, and he can resubmit the Clinton budget to Congress without drafting a whole new one. "But it won't be long before the stories are all about how many Clinton appointees are still in office, and that's a very damaging story for Gore," he said.
This political problem is exacerbated by the ferocious hostility between the parties over the election -- and the prolonged recount in Florida -- which is likely to carry over into a transition period and a new administration. Mr. Light said Mr. Gore could help defuse some of the tension by announcing as soon as possible that he was appointing prominent Republicans to his cabinet or even lassoing Gen. Colin L. Powell as his Secretary of State, as Mr. Bush has previously suggested.
Mr. Neel has been consulting regularly with Mr. Gore's longtime inner circle of closest advisers. The group includes former Representative Tom Downey of New York; Peter Knight, Mr. Gore's chief fund-raiser, and Jack Quinn, a former White House counsel and chief of staff to Mr. Gore. Officials said they expected Elaine Kamarck, a centrist Democrat who has advised Mr. Gore on domestic policy for years, to help coordinate policy matters during the transition.
Mr. Gore holds such decisions close to the vest, but various names have been circulating as possible appointees -- including some from the Clinton administration. These include Lawrence Summers, the treasury secretary, and Norman Minetta, commerce secretary, to stay in those jobs.
Alexis Herman, the labor secretary, has been deeply involved in the Gore campaign, and it would be surprising if she were not part of a new administration. On the defense front, there is talk of Richard Danzig, secretary of the navy, or former Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat, as defense secretary, and Richard Holbrooke as a possible secretary of state.
Other Clinton appointees who have helped Mr. Gore with policy matters during the campaign and could stay on include Gene Sperling, Mr. Clinton's chief economic adviser, and Bruce Reed, a top domestic policy adviser. William Daley, Mr. Gore's campaign chairman and Mr. Clinton's former commerce secretary, has been mentioned as a possible White House chief of staff, as has Jim Johnson, an executive of Fannie Mae and one-time top aide to Walter F. Mondale, the former vice president.
Terry McAuliffe, Mr. Clinton's chief fund-raiser, has been mentioned as a possible ambassador for Mr. Gore, and Steve Rattner, a prominent New York financier, could land in a treasury post.
With his public declaration Tuesday night of his transition plans, Mr. Gore was doing more than giving his aides the go-ahead to collect names. He was sending a full-blown message to the Bush camp and the nation that he was taking charge. He would no longer wait passively on the sidelines for Florida to determine the next president. Nor would he cede the public image of a president-to-be to Mr. Bush.
Aides said Mr. Gore felt so strongly about advancing the image of a man preparing to be president that he himself inserted the transition language into his speech Tuesday night.
Charles O. Jones, a retired political scientist from the University of Wisconsin and an expert on presidential transitions, said Mr. Gore's mention Tuesday of the transition was an important psychological move.
"Until then, he looked like a sore loser, like he was a candidate whining about what was happening to him," Mr. Jones said. But the Florida Supreme Court ruling gave him sufficient confidence to start talking about his transition. "It let him make that turn away from being a candidate and toward being the president-elect," Mr. Jones said.
He said that both candidates had lost important time in healing the partisanship left by the campaign. "Here we are, two weeks post the election, and we still don't get an interpretation from them what it means to transition into a 50-50 government," he said. "This has left us without anybody to elevate the thematics of this period."
Even in the best of times, when an election is settled on the first Tuesday after the first Monday of November, a new president has more than two months to take over the reins of power. If this year's election had been settled Nov. 8, there would have been 74 days for the president-elect to pave the way to the Jan. 20 inauguration.
As it is, the new president may not be named until Dec. 18, leaving him just about a month to go through what Mr. Light predicted, based on past numbers, will be at least 150,000 resumes. Those appointees who need Senate confirmation must also undergo background checks by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Internal Revenue Service, all of which Mr. Light said could delay the hiring of a full administration until early in 2002.

A Need for Presidential Leadership
One piece of conventional wisdom making the rounds these days is that investors may prefer the gridlock that a close presidential election brings.

HEADLINE: Russia Ending Deal on Arms Negotiated by Gore

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 22

 BODY:
Russia has notified the Clinton administration that it intends to withdraw from a 1995 agreement negotiated by Vice President Al Gore limiting Russian sales of tanks and other conventional weapons to Iran, officials said today.
The Russian foreign minister, Igor S. Ivanov, told Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright of the intended action four days before the presidential election. 
 President Clinton protested the Russian action when he met with President Vladimir V. Putin in Brunei last week, and Dr. Albright has warned Mr. Ivanov that if Russia makes new sales of advanced conventional weapons to Tehran, the Americans could impose economic sanctions against it.
Mr. Ivanov said the Russian decision would take effect on Dec. 1, and administration officials informed Congress of the decision on Tuesday.
The question of possible sanctions will fall to the next president, officials said.
Mr. Gore reached a confidential deal with Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, then the Russian prime minister, in June 1995 to exempt Russia from sanctions for selling weapons to Iran in exchange for Moscow's pledge that it would end all deliveries of sophisticated conventional arms to Tehran by last Dec. 31.
That deal appeared to undercut a 1992 law sponsored by Mr. Gore and Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, that mandated sanctions against countries that sold advanced conventional weapons to nations that the State Department classifies as state sponsors of terrorism. Iran is on that list.
The 1995 agreement permitted Russia to fulfill contracts with Tehran for hundreds of tanks, armored personnel carriers, artillery shells and mines. The deal also allowed Russia to deliver a diesel-powered submarine and a number of sophisticated torpedoes to Iran.
Russia violated the 1999 deadline, saying it needed more time to complete the deliveries under existing obligations, thereby irritating the United States, which complained to Russian officials. But by its latest action, Russia has now signaled its intent to enter into big new weapons contracts with Iran, American officials conclude.
The Russian action was reported in The Washington Post this morning.
Republicans in Congress and former officials who are advising Gov. George W. Bush harshly criticized the deal when details of its terms were first reported in The New York Times in mid-October. They complained today that the administration failed to act as Russia repeatedly violated what they called a flawed and unenforceable agreement.
"It comes as no great surprise that Russia has abrogated its commitments under the secret Gore-Chernomyrdin deal," Senator Sam Brownback, Republican of Kansas and a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement today. "The vice president cut a deal to look the other way on Russian transfers of weaponry to Iran for the past five years. But it is now clear that they can no longer turn a blind eye to Russia's actions."
Mr. Gore has cited his cooperation with Mr. Chernomyrdin on a variety of issues as one of his major accomplishments as vice president and an important part of his qualifications for the presidency.
The Russian move surfaced a day after the administration announced that China had pledged to stop exporting missile parts and production technology to countries developing nuclear weapons, including Iran and Pakistan. In exchange, the administration agreed to waive economic sanctions for past transfers of missile parts and production equipment.
In the case of Russian arms sales to Iran, administration officials said today that they were weighing retaliatory steps against Russia. They added that they hoped that Moscow would reconsider its withdrawal from the agreement.
A spokesman for Mr. Gore referred all questions to the State Department. An official of the Russian Embassy in Washington declined to comment.
Mr. Ivanov said in his letter to Dr. Albright, which was dated Nov. 3, that Russia was backing out of the understanding because of recent news reports about the 1995 Gore-Chernomyrdin deal. The agreement, signed in Moscow on June 30, 1995, concludes with the words, "This aide-memoire, as well as the attached annexes, will remain strictly confidential."
Dr. Albright replied to Mr. Ivanov that "there will be consequences for Russia, including the possibility of sanctions, if Russia proceeds with its plans for unilateral withdrawal," said Richard A. Boucher, the State Deparment's chief spokesman. "We are continuing to discuss this with Russians."
Officials in Congress who were briefed on the Russian action on Tuesday expressed anger that it was concealed from them for two weeks after Dr. Albright received the Ivanov letter.
A State Department official defended the administration's silence, saying that the secretary of state and other officials were quietly trying to persuade the Russians to reconsider.

HEADLINE: Cantwell Declared Washington Victor

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Nov. 22

 BODY:
Maria Cantwell, a 42-year-old Democrat who made a fortune with a high-tech company and campaigned as champion of the new economy, has been named the winner of what had been the nation's last undecided Senate race, defeating the three-term Republican incumbent, Slade Gorton of Washington, by just under 2,000 votes.
With Ms. Cantwell's apparent victory, the upper chamber will be evenly divided -- 50 Democrats and 50 Republicans -- needing the vice president to break ties. However, if Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut is elected vice president, Republicans would retain a one-vote advantage because the Republican governor of Connecticut would appoint a Republican to the seat. 
 After more than two weeks of counting late absentee votes, all 39 counties in Washington certified their ballots today, giving Ms. Cantwell a 1,953-vote margin out of 2.5 million votes. The final tally is subject to an automatic recount, but the three statewide recounts in Washington since 1977 have never changed the outcome of a major election and never added more than 230 votes to any candidate or initiative.
"This is remarkable," said Ellis Conklin, a spokeswoman for Ms. Cantwell. "A few days ago Slade Gorton was preparing his victory party, and now we have pulled off the upset. And it looks like it's going to be big enough to be bullet-proof in a recount."
Mr. Gorton did not concede today but issued a statement tonight saying he was "cautiously pessimistic." He said he would not comment further until after the recount.
With Ms. Cantwell's victory, Washington becomes the third state to send two women to the United States Senate, joining California and Maine. Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat, is Washington's other Senator. There will be 13 women in the Senate next January -- a record.
Last week, when Senator Gorton was up by 16,000 votes with about 50,000 still to count, Democrats in this state had already written Ms. Cantwell's political obituary. The party leader in Washington, Paul Berendt, predicted a Gorton victory of up to 3,000 votes.
But the suburban areas in the Puget Sound region, combined with the Seattle area, gave Ms. Cantwell her victory, even though she carried only 5 of the 39 counties.
"It appears as though we lost our edge in the suburbs this time," said Brett Bader, a leading consultant for Republicans in this state. "There seems to be a seismic shift going on in Washington. It's no longer a swing state; it's becoming Democratic."
American Indians, who singled out Mr. Gorton as the target of the first nationwide campaign by the tribes against a single national office holder, and environmentalists who have long opposed the senator, say they deserve much of the credit for defeating Mr. Gorton. The senator, as chairman of a committee that controls money for Indian spending and public lands, has fought the tribes on everything from fishing rights to sovereignty and has blasted environmental organizations as extremist.
Six years ago, Ms. Cantwell was a defeated, one-term member of Congress with no job. She became an executive with RealNetworks, a Seattle software company that pioneered video and audio streaming through the Web. In her campaign, she spent $10 million of her own money -- more than a third of the personal fortune she made a RealNetworks.
Ms. Cantwell's campaign was low on ideology. She cast herself as a product of the new century economy who could move Washington well beyond its old roots in the natural resource-based economy.
Mr. Gorton allied himself with the timber, mining and agricultural industries, taking strong stands against tearing down dams to save endangered salmon. He frequently joined more conservative Western Republican senators in opposing the Clinton administration plans to set aside forests and rivers as wilderness. Last year, he inserted a rider onto a relief bill for Kosovo that would give the go-ahead to cyanide-leach gold mine in north central Washington.
"Slade Gorton lost because he was not a moderate and not green enough," said Ron Sims, a Democrat who lost to Mr. Gorton six years ago, and is the executive of King County, which has 29 percent of the state's population.
"Maria came across as moderate, nonpartisan and environmentalist -- and that's what people want in this state," said Mr. Sims.
Mr. Gorton was also the leading adviser on Western issues to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
Mr. Gorton has been mentioned by party leaders as a potential member of a Bush cabinet.
Mr. Gorton also was a strong ally of Microsoft in its battle with the Justice Department. And even though Bill Gates, the Microsoft co-founder, called Mr. Gorton the strongest political friend the company had ever had, Ms. Cantwell won the normally Republican areas east of Seattle, where Microsoft is based.
"It is no longer Seattle against the rest of the state," Mr. Bader said.

HEADLINE: Protests Are Stepped Up at Hague Talks on Greenhouse Gases

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN

DATELINE: THE HAGUE, Nov. 22

 BODY:
Protests at climate-treaty talks here reached a high pitch today. Demonstrators climbed into the rafters of a central room, blockaded doorways, passed out Christmas stockings stuffed with coal and splattered the top American negotiator with a cream pie at a news conference tonight.
The incident occurred halfway through the second week of contentious talks, due to wind up on Friday, in which delegates from 175 countries are debating ways to slow emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases, chiefly from burning fossil fuels. 
 The meeting, seeking to create environmental and economic policies to carry out a treaty negotiated in 1997 in Kyoto, Japan, has been the focus of a growing protests. The demonstration today centered on contentions that loopholes would prevent cuts in the use of fossil fuel.
The United States under secretary of state for global affairs, Frank E. Loy, had just begun defending the American stance in the talks, which has been criticized by European officials and environmental groups as too weak, when a woman jumped from her seat and threw the pie in his face.
Wiping whipped cream from his lip, Mr. Loy cut short his talk and later issued a statement that said: "On the eve of Thanksgiving, pumpkin pie would have been a more traditional choice, but what I really want is a strong agreement to fight global warming. I'm headed back to the negotiating table right now with that aim."
Environmental groups that are lobbying delegations and observing discussions disavowed the attack. "Many are frustrated by the slow pace of negotiations and the lack of domestic action against global warming," said a letter issued by several dozen environmental groups. "However, we believe there are more constructive ways to achieve our goals of preventing dangerous climate change."
The Kyoto Protocol calls for industrialized nations to reduce their combined greenhouse-gas releases by 2012 to a level at least 5 percent below emissions in 1990.
Earlier today, negotiators said, some progress had been made on several important sticking points, including the roles of nuclear power and the situation in Russia, where emissions have plunged because of economic decline. That has produced a windfall of pollution credits that Russia might eventually sell to countries that are unwilling or unable to reduce emissions.
Nuclear power has been a pivotal issue for the European Union and many environmental groups, which have pressed to have it excluded from a list of technologies that wealthy countries could export to poor countries to help them avoid future emissions of carbon dioxide.
But Canada, China and the United States oppose such a ban. And France, despite its outward opposition, relies heavily on nuclear plants for its electricity.
Tonight, it appeared that language was evolving that would give strong preference under the treaty to less controversial nonpolluting options like wind turbines, but would not explicitly banish nuclear plants.
Separately, Russia proposed that any income it received from selling pollution credits would go into a "green fund" that would be used to pay only for energy-efficiency projects. Bill Hare, the chief representative of Greenpeace International and a longtime critic of Russia's selling its pollution credits, said the proposal was a move in the right direction. "This looks like a positive initiative," he said.

HEADLINE: COUNTING THE VOTE;
Bush Motion Cites Fear of 'Disruption,' Saying 'Presidency Itself Is at Stake'

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from two filings in the United States Supreme Court by the Bush campaign and others, the first seeking expedited handing of an appeal of a ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, and the second the appeal itself:
 
Motion to Expedite Consideration
This is a case of the utmost national importance, involving the Constitution's most fundamental rights as exercised in the nation's most important election. The outcome of the election for the presidency of the United States may hang in the balance. 
 Petitioners Bush and Chancy received the most votes in the state of Florida in the presidential election held Nov. 7, 2000. That result was confirmed by a statewide recount and confirmed again after a tabulation of overseas absentee ballots. Yet the Supreme Court of Florida has prevented state officials from certifying the appointment of electors in accordance with the popular vote. Instead, state officials have been compelled to postpone any final decision pending the completion of a selective, capricious and standardless manual count of ballots cast in only a handful of unrepresentative Florida counties. As explained in greater detail in the accompanying petition for certiorari, the manual recount currently being conducted is riddled with severe and pervasive irregularities, including the physical manipulation and degradation of ballots, manifest inconsistancies in counting methods, and a politically charged, partisan atmosphere, all of which have combined to spawn a process that now borders an anarchy.
Petitioners seek a writ of certiorari to review the constitutionality of these arbitrary and ad hoc recount procedures, which are being employed in an apparent effort to influence after the fact the will of the citizens of Florida and possibly to change the outcome of the presidential election. Review by this Court is warranted in ensure the legality, fairness and legitimacy of the election.
This Court's expedited consideration of the petition is warranted to halt the ongoing rampant violations of petitioners' constitutional rights, to address events that are turning the presidential election in Florida into a circus, and to restore stability by bringing the 2000 presidential election to orderly finality in accordance with constitutional law.
Time is plainly on of the essence: Florida must certify its representatives to the Electoral College before Dec. 18, 2000, the date on which the College meets to select the next President and Vice President of the United States. If this matter is not resolved prior to that time not only petitioners but the nation as a whole may suffer injury from the resulting confusion. Indeed, the intense national and worldwide attention on the recount efforts to date only foreshadows the disruption that may well follow if the uncertainty and unfairness that have shrouded this election are allowed to persist. Simply put, the importance of a prompt resolution of the federal constitutional questions presented by this case cannot be overstated.
Should this Court grant the petition for certiorari, an expedited briefing schedule is necessary for the same reasons. Particularly given the importance of the issues presented, it is in the best interests of the parties, as well as the nation, that this Court have as much time as possible to consider the relative merits of the parties' positions and to issue its decision sufficiently in advance of the Electoral College's selection of the next president and vice president on Dec. 18, 2000.
This Court has previously granted expedited treatment of cases involving substantial questions of national importance. The importance of this case is at least equal to, if not greater than, those landmark decisions. The presidency itself is at stake.
Accordingly, petitioners respectfully submit that respondents should be directed to file their response(s) to the petition by 9 a.m. on Friday, Nov. 24, 2000; that petitioners submit their reply brief in support of certiorari by 9 a.m. on Saturday, Nov. 25; and that the Court issue its ruling on the petition as soon as practicable thereafter.
If certiorari is granted, petitioners submit that opening briefs for petitioners and respondents, together with any amicus curiae briefs, should be filed and served by 7 p.m. on Wednesday, Nov. 29, 2000; that reply briefs for petitioners and respondents to be filed and served by 7 p.m. on Friday, Dec. 1, 2000; and that oral arguments to be held on the afternoon of Tuesday, Dec. 5, 2000.
 
Petition for Writ of Certiorari
The selective manual recount process has unquestionably damaged ballot integrity. Representative of the county respondents have admitted that the more the ballots are handled, the more chads will fall off, making it more likely that the ballot recount (and any future recount under constitutional standards) will produce different numbers from this cause alone. Observers of the manual recounts have consistently reported that ballots have been bent, prodded, poked and aggressively handled. Ballots have been twisted, crumpled, creased, and dropped; same have been stained with ink with pens, and crushed. In some instances, the ballots were even used as fans.
Unsurprisingly, this aggressive mishandling of ballots, especially after two or more machine counts of the ballots, dislodged large numbers of chads, which littered the floors of the recount rooms. When observers at tempted to memorialize the presence of dislodged chads, Democratic officials and county employees attempted to sweep away the chads rather than have the physical degradation documented.
Thus, ballots that survive the repeated mechanical and manual recounts to which they have been subjected may not resemble the ballots Floridians actually cast on Nov. 7, and the tabulations that result from this process cannot be be said to be an accurate, fair or consistent tabulation of the votes cast by Floridians in that election.
The manual recount process is chaotic, hanging and uncertain. Differing and sometimes self-contradictory guidelines were issued and then retracted.
Other rules were not communicated to the ballot counters. The inevitable result was a complete lack of uniformity across the four counties and within the counties.
For example, a representative of the Palm Beach Board admitted that during the initial manual recount the board had applied inconsistent tests and procedures for determining which ballots to count and had changed its approach to that crucial issue midstream. According to another Palm Beach Board official, the standard for determining which ballots to count manually "is very vague in the law," and "the canvassing board . . . make s the rules . . . They can do what they want as far as once they decide amongst themselves."
In Miami-Dade County, the supervisor of elections asked the canvassing board to define the criteria that would be employed in conducting the remaining partial manual recount. In response, the chairman of the board stated that he could not know whether to count a ballot "until I reasonably see it." As he elaborated, "I don't think we should limit ourselves in the parameters by which we would consider. . . . I believe that we will know when we see, so to speak, what we are looking at . . ." The board thus declined to set any standards, leaving the question of which ballots were to be counted to ad hoc, case-by-case discretion applied by officials acting with full knowledge of the election results elsewhere.
As Respondent Florida Democratic Party conceded in its Answer Brief in the Florida Supreme Court, "Different canvassing boards are using different standards. In fact, the Florida Democratic Party (F.D.P.) has sued to insure this divergence occurs.
These widely varying policies (or lack of policies), and the confusing legal challenges to them, have translated into severe problems in the vote tabulating process itself. In Broward County for example, the two-corner rule has apparently not been well-communicated to the counters and is, in any event, under legal attack. Other internal counting rules, such as double-counting final stacks of ballots, have been announced, temporarily applied, and then rescinded. In general, confusion, disarray and mistakes are commonplace in the vote-counting process.
The lack of intelligible, uniform standards fatally undermines any claim that manual recounting actually captures the intent of the voters.
The atmosphere has become politically charged with pressure being exerted on the county boards and their lawyers by prominent political figures such as former Secretary of State and current Gore campaign spokesperson Warren Christopher and Florida Attorney General Robert Butterworth. Indeed, observers also noted that the elections officers exhibited partisan bias and even hostility. (guidance to ballot counters expressed hostility to Republican attorney observers and implied that a Republican president would endanger the economy and increase the chances of war). Such external political pressure obviously increases the likelihood that conscious or unconscious bias will further taint the recount
Other signs of politically driven decision-making proliferate. For example, the Broward County Canvassing Boards originally decided not to authorize a county wide manual recount, but then reversed that decision in a 2-1 vote after extensive political lobbying. Media reports have widely recounted the erratic nature of the various canvassing boards and their decisions whether to proceed with manual re counts. The on-again, off-again process further illustrates the unchecked nature of the County Respondents' discretion, and demonstrates that the recounts do not provide a stable, fair, deliberate and objective counting of ballots. . . .
This case is extraordinary. It raises issues of imperative public importance seen only once in a generation. Indeed, not since United States v. Nixon (1974), have questions of similar magnitude been brought before this court. . . . This Court's direct and immediate review of the lower courts' refusal to halt the selective manual recount is warranted because this case "is of such imperative public importance" that the Court should deviate from normal appellate practice. As discussed in greater detail below, this case presents important questions regarding the First and Fourteenth Amendments' protections for the fundamental right to vote.
Moreover, these questions are presented in the context of one of the closest elections for president in our nation's history.
There is a profound national interest in ensuring the fairness and finality of elections, particularly in an election for the highest office in the land. The constitutionality of the arbitrary recount process currently being implemented by the county respondents in this crucial election presents precisely the type of question that the nation justifiably expects should be decided by this Court. Indeed, absent a decision by this Court, the election results from Florida may lack finality and legitimacy. The consequences may well include the ascension of a President of questionable legitimacy, or a constitutional crisis.

CONNECTICUT WAGES RANKED

BYLINE: By Leslie Eaton

 BODY:
Workers in Connecticut had the second-highest average pay in the nation again last year, according to data released last week by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. The average in Connecticut in 1999 was $42,653, which trails the $50,742 average in for workers in the District of Columbia, but surpasses New York's $42,133, which ranked third. The numbers, based on unemployment-insurance data, are calculated by dividing the total payroll in the state by the average number of people who work there. Connecticut workers matched the average annual wage-growth increase of 4.3 percent. New York workers' gains lagged at 3.6 percent; The state of Washington scored the highest increase, at 8 percent.

HERMELIN, DAVID B.

 BODY:
HERMELIN-David B. The officers, Board of Trustees, and staff of United Jewish Communities deeply mourn the passing of Ambassador David B. Hermelin, a beloved friend and colleague, one of the world's great philanthropic leaders, and a devoted supporter of Israel and the Jewish people. A renowned local, national and international leader, David's dedication to many charitable causes was legendary, and his commitment lives on in the work of many institutions in Israel and his own community of Detroit. He was a UJA National Vice Chairman, member of the Board of Trustees and Campaign Cabinet, and served as Chairman of the Israel 50th Anniversary Committee. He served as International Chairman of State of Israel Bonds, President Emeritus of World ORT Union and President of American ORT Federation. David's leadership also included the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, Hebrew University, Weizmann Institute, Bar-Ilan University, HIAS, and United Synagogue for Conservative Judaism. Locally, he played leading roles as Vice President of the Jewish Federation of Metropolitan Detroit, Chairman of the Federation's Annual Campaign, President of the Jewish Home and Aging Services, President of Congregation Shaarey Zedek, Board Member of Children's Hospital of Michigan, National Co-Chair for Major Gifts at the University of Michigan from which he received an Honorary Doctorate, Chairman of the Special Advisory Council of the Karmanos Cancer Institute, and much more. He was nominated by President Clinton in October 1997 to serve as America's Ambassador to Norway, a position he held until January 2000, when he resigned for medical reasons. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Doreen, their five children and five grandchildren. Charles R. Bronfman, Chairman of the Board Joel D. Tauber, Chairman, Executive Committee Stephen D. Solender, President and CEO
HERMELIN-David B.

Strum, Exec V.P. Paul Bernick, Exec. Dir. Emeritus Alvin Gray, Past Pres. Paul Borman, Past Pres. Michael Stoler, Past Pres.
HERMELIN-David. World ORT deeply mourns the passing of our former President David Hermelin. Fully identifying with ORT's educational aims, David Hermelin worked tirelessly for our organisation as a lay leader, serving as President of World ORT from 1993 until his appointment as US Ambassador to Norway in 1997.

HERMELIN-David B. The Executive Committee, management, faculty and students of ORT Israel are in mourning over the untimely death of Ambassador David Hermelin, past President of American ORT and World ORT. Ambassador Hermelin was a friend and supporter of ORT Israel. It was his vision and devotion to the people of Israel and to the ORT Israel community that resulted in the construction of the beautiful ORT college campus in Netanya that bears his name. David Hermelin was present at the first dedication of the college, June 1997. His illness prevented him from attending the inauguration of the campus on October 22, 2000. His daughter, Julie, represented the family at the celebration.

He set an exemplary standard of dedication to the finest traditions and highest values of public service and community involvement. Our loss is irreparable.

HEADLINE: A Newly Cool Newark Says, 'C'mon Over!'

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS

 BODY:
LET'S go to Newark!
Go ahead, shake your head. Roll your eyes. You've heard all the jokes about Newark. You've probably made a few of your own. Thanks to Hollywood and the media, who can blame you for thinking of New Jersey's largest city as America's pre-eminent symbol of inner-city decay, runaway crime and unrelenting despair? 
 But 33 years after civil unrest and staggering depopulation sapped this city of its vitality, Newark is finally, and unmistakably, back. There's a shimmering new performing arts center, a minor league baseball stadium and a charming world-class art museum. But you knew that.
What you may not have known is that Newark has a top-notch collection of Art Deco architecture, a vibrant enclave of Brazilian and Portuguese immigrants and an unheralded hip-hop, soul and gospel music scene, all just minutes from the overpriced mayhem of Midtown Manhattan. There's a jaw-dropping cathedral to rival St. Patrick's, more flowering cherry trees than in Washington and an astonishingly efficient subway line with 53-year-old rolling stock that will make you smile.
Unlike most American cities, Newark's downtown is a place to be strolled. With a 50 percent drop in crime since 1995, its streets feel safe; its parks are welcoming and well-tended. There is plenty to eat, from a trove of Spanish and South American cuisine to a newly opened high-end restaurant that offers some of the Garden State's most refined dining.
Of course, it would be misleading to portray Newark as chic, bustling and self-confident. There are still acres of parking lots, sorrowful rows of vacant buildings and plenty of disheartening sights. Its residents, most of whom live outside the city center, remain mired in poverty.
But for the first time in a generation, there are good reasons to explore this former industrial powerhouse by the Passaic River. Straddling most of the region's highways, it's a quick car trip from anywhere in the metropolitan area, although this tour guide encourages a visit by mass transit. Most of New Jersey's commuter trains stop here, and Manhattan residents can dive under the Hudson on PATH, a subway that costs a mere dollar. (But hurry: a fare increase is in the wind.) For an extra 75 cents, New Jersey Transit trains make the trip from Pennsylvania Station nonstop in 15 minutes.
In contrast to the cramped, windowless catacomb that replaced McKim, Mead & White's soaring locomotive palace in Manhattan, Newark's Pennsylvania Station survives with all its Art Deco glories intact. Designed by the same architects, it was raised during the depths of the Depression, although you wouldn't know it from the embarrassment of Napoleon gray marble, rose yellow travertine and Indiana limestone.
Peek into the waiting room and look up at its cobalt blue ceiling tiles, the zigzagging aluminum door trim and the row of medallions ennobling such modes of travel as the canoe, the stagecoach and the stallion. A $38 million modernization and faithful restoration of the station, where 70,000 commuters a day pass through, is continuing.
 
Next: The Ironbound
Turn around and exit through the station's rear doors, which leaves you facing Ferry Street. This is the Ironbound, a neighborhood of Iberian and Latin American immigrants that maintained its dignity (and its real estate values) while the rest of Newark fell into the abyss.
Named for the railroad tracks that nearly surround it, the Ironbound was dominated by Polish, Italian and Spanish immigrants until the 1960's, when the poverty of Portugal under the dictator Antonio Salazar persuaded many of its people to go elsewhere. Newark, with a population of 263,000, probably has 19,000 Portuguese residents and even a consulate, although a thriving economy back home and European Union membership have slowed the influx of new arrivals. Brazilians, drawn in part by a shared language, have been filling the void, as have smaller numbers of Ecuadoreans, Colombians and Mexicans.
Head up Ferry Street, the main artery, into what feels more like a village than a city. On weekends, the sidewalks buzz with energy, as do the restaurants, bakeries and food markets.
There are two schools of eating in the Ironbound: the old-guard Portuguese and Spanish restaurants, with their dark paneling, red tablecloths and melding of American and Iberian fare, and the newer, fuss-free Brazilian establishments with their simple meals and local clientele.
Fornos of Spain, Iberia Peninsula and Seabra's, among the best known, serve garlic-laden seafood, the standard paella and fragrant Spanish wines. The crowds are often out-of-towners, although the bars fill up at night with work-worn Portuguese men chatting loudly as they down broiled shrimp and wine.
 
Flickering Street Lamps
Sol-Mar, a good 10-minute walk up Ferry Street, is typically Portuguese, with its Disneyfied mishmash of old Lisbon and country tavern decor. There are flickering street lamps and a waterfall, and old plows and saddles hang from the ceramic-tiled eaves. The portions of oxtail and spaghetti, grilled tilefish, and pork cubes with clams can be staggering.
Brazilians tend to gather at the three Casa Nova restaurants, one of which sits across the street from Sol-Mar. Rodizio de churrasco, the endless parade of grilled meats, is the specialty here. The decor is simple and the mood appropriately boisterous.
Before you head back downtown, a dozen bakeries demand careful consideration. The Portuguese ones dominate Ferry Street, among them Coutinho's, Delicias and Aveirense, where pastel de coco (coconut cups) and bolo de arroz (rice pudding cakes) cry out for a cup of espresso. Padaria Brasileira has its own take on dessert, with crisp caramel-stuffed pastries called folhadas and coconut-and-cheese-filled queijadinha. It also serves an array of Brazilian lunch staples like crab cake, collard green soup and roasted ribs.
If you have a hankering for sardines or mackerel, Ferry Street's fish markets will make you swoon. (Fresh shipments arrive from Portugal on Thursdays.) Local travel agencies offer cheap air fares to Portugal and Brazil, and the furniture stores sell outrageously flamboyant ensembles that really belong in a museum.
With doggie bag in hand, head back toward Penn Station. You could walk the four blocks from here to downtown, but then you'd miss one of the city's most thrilling attractions, the 4.3-mile Newark subway. The last surviving leg of a long-vanished streetcar system, Newark's City Subway is essentially a trolley that plunges underground for its last mile. Stepping into the vintage cars, with their Cyclops headlights and pull cords for stops, will bring on a wave of nostalgia, even if you were born after the American streetcar was slain by the bus. The cars, built in 1947, are clean and graffiti-free, and serious crime, the conductors swear, is nonexistent. Even its underground stations are quaint. Wall mosaics at each stop depict life on the old Morris Canal, a link between the Delaware River and the Atlantic that was drained in 1930 to make way for the subway.
There is another compelling reason to hop a trolley: the cars are not long for this world. Sometime next year, they are to be replaced by a modern fleet of light rail cars, a necessary evil dictated by the old fleet's inaccessibility to disabled passengers. There are other problems with the creaky cars: replacement parts are impossible to find, and the lack of air-conditioning makes them stifling in summer. One can only hope that the 45-cent off-peak fare will hold for a while longer.
 
An Olmsted Park
Take the train to Park Avenue, which will leave you at the edge of Branch Brook Park, 10.8 acres of rolling meadows, 3,000 blossoming cherry trees and two meandering streams. Designed by Frederick Law Olmsted and opened in 1895, the park is in fairly good shape, considering the absence of deep-pocket benefactors. There are a few sorry sights, like the vandalized granite plinth, built in 1903 to honor a long-forgotten singing troupe.
Head for the towers of Cathedral Basilica of the Sacred Heart and make your way around the lake and head up the hill. Started in 1899, this French Gothic behemoth wasn't finished until 1954, when it became the official seat of Newark's Roman Catholic archdiocese. These days, the entrance is on Ridge Street, which rules out a ceremonial entrance through the massive Italian-made bronze doors. (They were, of course, flung open for Pope John Paul II's 1995 visit.) Set on Newark's highest point, Sacred Heart has a nave wider than Chartres, vaulting higher than Canterbury and towers that would overshadow Notre Dame.
It is an awesome space, with three dreamy rose windows and richly carved chapels dedicated to the ethnic groups that poured their hard-earned savings into the cathedral's construction. Even though its congregation has dwindled over the years, Sacred Heart, the archdiocese's showpiece, is meticulously maintained. There is a sporadic series of concerts.
 
The Signs of Renewal
Take an alternate route through the park on your way back to the Park Avenue subway station. Get off at Washington Street, which skirts the edge of Rutgers University's Newark campus. New Jersey Institute of Technology and the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey are just a few minutes away as well.
If a group of philanthropists and business leaders prevail, these forlorn town houses and empty lots will one day become a round-the-clock village of apartments, restaurants, nightclubs and shops. The New Newark Foundation has bought three square blocks, and its hope is to capitalize on the success of the New Jersey Performing Arts Center and the thousands of students who commute to nearby campuses but leave after nightfall. Its most promising venture so far would turn the immense Hahne's department store building into luxury housing.
There are already signs of renewal: the year-old Euphoria Cafe, a sofa-stuffed coffee house on Academy Street, and Je's, a soul-food restaurant on Halsey Street, where Shaquille O'Neal and Queen Latifah dine when visiting their former hometown. Another pocket of optimism can be found on and around nearby James Street, a 20-block historic district where dozens of stately Queen Anne houses have been restored. At the other end of Halsey Street is Hobby's, a delicatessen that is the only remnant of Newark's Jewish community, which started migrating to the western suburbs in the 1940's. For a contrasting slice of Newark, head over to the Priory on West Market Street, a jazz club and restaurant that fills up with the churchgoing crowd on Sunday afternoons.
For now, however, walk along Washington Street until you reach the Newark Museum, one of this city's biggest drawing cards and reason enough for Jerseyphobes to leave Manhattan. Entry is free. The museum was founded at the turn of the last century, and Louis Bamberger, the department store magnate, financed the museum's first building of its own in 1926, setting it beside a 25-room Victorian mansion, the Ballantine House, that puts Martha Stewart's decorating impulses to shame. In 1989, the Princeton architect Michael Graves helped bring all the elements together with a $21 million expansion that doubled the museum's exhibition space.
Philistines overwhelmed by mega-museums will find Newark's collection an easily digestible joy. From Winslow Homer to Andy Warhol, the collection takes in an eclectic range of 19th- and 20th-century painting and sculpture.
It also features the nation's finest array of Tibetan art, an impressive display of African crafts, a planetarium and even a miniature zoo. The recently restored Ballantine House, built by the beer-brewing family in 1885, is a wonderfully cluttered primer on Victorian life. The museum's atrium cafe, selling basic soups, salads and sandwiches (including peanut butter and jelly), is a soothing place to pause.
 
A Spiffed-Up Skyscraper
Leaving the museum takes you to Washington Park, the city's first marketplace, former home of its merchant princes and setting of some of its most glorious 20th-century public edifices: the public library, with its three-story atrium and mosaic-covered vaults; the sober neo-classic Veterans Administration Building; and the oddball American Insurance Company headquarters, a Greek temple grafted to the base of a modern skyscraper. Across the park is the former headquarters of Mutual Benefit Life, a crisply rendered, green-glass homage to the International Style. A few paces down is the Art Deco beauty built for the company most of us still refer to as Bell Atlantic.
Walk along Broad Street, where the ghosts of the past bump up against a more hopeful future. Between the year-old Riverfront Stadium, home to the Newark Bears baseball team, and the sparkling performing arts center are a score of old department stores and office buildings that await a new life. There are S. Klein's, the Griffith Piano Building and Hahne's, their windows pitifully dark, and then there's the sparkling Newark National Building, the city's tallest skyscraper and all spiffed up after a $50 million renovation. Starbucks, the coffee chain, has given Newark its stamp of confidence by setting up shop in a ground-floor storefront. Facing Military Park is the old Essex Club, which has been restored as the new home of the New Jersey Historical Society.
Directly across the street is Trinity Cathedral, a country church that hasn't changed much since a group of Episcopalians laid its cornerstone in 1742, infuriating the Puritan power brokers still trying to maintain a monopoly on the city's religious life.
Robert Treat, the Puritan patriarch who founded the city in 1666, might have been completely forgotten if not for the hotel across Military Park that bears his name. When it opened in 1916, on the 250th anniversary of Newark's founding, the city was a puffed-up industrial giant. President and Mrs. Woodrow Wilson attended the opening and were the hotel's first guests.
Somehow the Robert Treat survived the grim years, and its owner, emboldened by the opening of the nearby performing arts center, recently spent several million dollars refurbishing its 169 rooms. The hotel's regrettably bland addition has become home to Maize, a high-end restaurant that may be the canary for those who believe Newark can overcome its poisoned past.
With $25 entrees and a chef whose credentials include Le Bernardin and Bouley in Manhattan, Maize, at least during a few recent visits, seems to be drawing back the reluctant suburbanite.
 
A Lavish Arts Center
Of course, the single greatest hope for Newark's revival is the $180 million performing arts center, now entering its fourth season. Even if you don't have evening concert plans, duck into the lobby of what many critics say is the finest new arts complex in the country. It is a lavish and generous affirmation of Newark, and unlike many performing arts centers, set on vast, offputting plazas, Barton Myers's design meets the city at the sidewalk. Theater Square Grill, the stylish in-house restaurant, has become so popular that pre-theater reservations must be booked weeks in advance.
It may not be apparent to the newcomer, but this extravaganza of brick and glass has had its desired effect as an engine for urban renewal. New restaurants like Maize and the growing collection of downtown development projects are tapping into the arts center's energy. A new riverfront park, under construction across McCarter Highway, will become the theater's front lawn, and a new light rail line linking Penn Station to the area is to open in 2005.
But perhaps the most powerful statement of the arts center's -- and Newark's -- success can be glimpsed on warm summer nights, when thousands of people throng its outdoor plaza for a weekly music series that has become Newark's town social. Sound in the City, as it is called, draws a racially mixed crowd of young professionals, many of them commuters who would surely have blanched at the thought of venturing into this city after dark a few years ago.
As day gives way to night, they mingle and stroll around nearby streets without looking over their shoulders. Like a growing number of people, they have stumbled upon a secret that one hopes will reach more ears. New Jersey, they have discovered, is not just an endless series of highways, strip malls and mind-numbing sprawl. Newark is proving otherwise. And what a relief it is.

HEADLINE: ON THE ROAD;
Flashin' Those Dreamy Eyes Way Down Yonder

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr.

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS

 BODY:
They have their own way of doing things in the Big Easy. They always have.
They have their own languid pace, which led Tennessee Williams, a sometime resident, to rhapsodize about "those long rainy afternoons in New Orleans, when an hour isn't just an hour but a little piece of eternity dropped into your hands, and who knows what to do with it?" 
 They have their own music -- not only jazz, which was more or less invented in Storyville, the red-light district long since replaced by a scruffy, drug-plagued housing project, but also zydeco, the stomping sound from the small Cajun towns west of here, and the blues, in whose evolution New Orleans played a major role, together with other spots along the Mississippi River.
They have their own drinks, seldom found elsewhere -- sazeracs and Ramos gin fizzes and sugary hurricanes at Pat O'Brien's on Bourbon Street, as well as Barq's root beer, which has lately become a national brand. They have their own sandwiches, like muffulettas and po'-boys, and their own sauces, like remoulade and ravigote, derived from but not really very similar to the French originals, and idiosyncratic dishes like etouffes, which are seafood stews. They drink their coffee heavily laced with chicory and eat beignets with it rather than doughnuts.
They have their own accent, which at its ripest sounds a little like Brooklyn and a little like Savannah; as rendered hereabouts, the name of their city is "New AWL-yuns."
They have their own legal system; like all of Louisiana and unlike the other 49 states, they operate under the Napoleonic Code, a legacy from the days when this was Nouvelle Orleans, the pride of French North America. They live in parishes, not in counties.
They have their own way of burying the dead. Because the city was built on low-lying land, coffins placed underground had a nasty habit of bobbing to the surface during floods and downpours. So New Orleans cemeteries are filled with mausoleums, row upon row of above-ground tombs. "Cities of the Dead," these are called, spooky in the moonlight and in Anne Rice's novels. They have their own odd approach to nomenclature, particularly place names. The streets that cross St. Charles Avenue at the downtown end are named for muses -- Terpischore, Erato, Clio, Euterpe.
In the French Quarter every first-time visitor encounters and inevitably mispronounces Chartres Street ("Charters") and Burgundy ("Burr-GUN-dee"). You can drive down Elysian Fields Avenue, another echo of New France, but sadly, the streetcars no longer run to Desire.
 
American by Purchase Only
Right from the start, New Orleans has been a French and Spanish, black and Catholic city, standing well apart from the largely Protestant, Anglo-Saxon American norm. Founded by Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne in 1718 on a big bend in the Mississippi (hence the nickname "Crescent City"), ruled for decades by Spain, it came under American control with the Louisiana Purchase of 1803. By then its ways were already set.
This is a Caribbean city, an exuberant, semi-tropical city, perhaps the most hedonistic city in the United States. You see more orgies (and more nuns) in New Orleans than you see anywhere else in the nation. Even more than Miami, it looks to the south, toward the volatility that is Latin America.
A long time ago, that paragon among journalists, A. J. Liebling, described New Orleans as a cross between Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and Paterson, N.J. It reminds me of Marseille, with a civic culture marked by crime, corruption, humidity, poverty and poor education on one hand, and a love of good food, good drink and good times on the other. Its joie de vivre is well-nigh inexhaustible, and for all its raffishness and fine distinctions of class and caste, its people have an inborn sweetness that extends from Garden District matrons to garage mechanics.
After an evening spent discussing the city's problems with us, Pixie Reiss, a schoolmate of my wife, Betsey, called me to say: "Don't forget the grace. It's a graceful city."
So it is. It is also "some decadent," as a waiter named Ronald remarked to us another evening as we reveled in yet another rich dinner.
From time to time New Orleans mayors have struggled against corruption. One who did so was an aristocrat named deLesseps S. Morrison Jr., known as "Chep," who served in the 1950's. More recently, Ernest Morial and his son Marc, the current mayor, have had a go. Still, graft remains endemic here; in truth, the city seems to prefer its politics with a dash of Tabasco.
There was always plenty of support in New Orleans for Edwin W. Edwards, the smooth-talking Cajun governor who once boasted that he would never be beaten unless he was "found in bed with a live boy or a dead girl." But after one trial that ended in a hung jury and another that produced an acquittal, Mr. Edwards was finally convicted of racketeering, conspiracy and extortion last May in a case centering on riverboat gambling licenses.
 
A Violent Streak
Meanwhile, poverty persists, cheek by jowl with wealth, much of it inherited. A block or two from mansions with palm-shaded gardens stand crude unpainted bungalows fronting on crumbling streets, more reminiscent of the third world than dot-com America. In 1989, according to Census Bureau figures, 31.6 percent of New Orleanians lived below the poverty line; in 1993, the figure was 37.9 percent, and in 1995, it was 33.6 percent -- one in three.
Most of the poor, in a city almost three-quarters black, are African-American. Few of them are Asian. The 10,000 Vietnamese who settled here, in a hot, damp, tangled, swampy landscape like the one they fled, have prospered.
The city's police superintendent, Richard J. Pennington, who is black, told me that most of the violent crime here takes place in or around public housing and other poor neighborhoods, and that most of it is black upon black. In New Orleans, he said, "we don't have very many black people preying upon white tourists -- or upon white residents."
This is a very violent place. The F.B.I. Uniform Crime Report for 1998 said that in that year, New Orleans ranked second to Pine Bluff, Ark., in murders per 100,000 population. Pine Bluff had 33.8, New Orleans 22.1 and the United States as a whole 6.3.
But Mr. Pennington, a tall, imposing man who came here from Washington, D.C., six years ago, has had real success in driving the numbers down. He raised pay to help recruiting (rookies went from $16,000 a year to $30,000), converted apartments in housing projects into mini-stations, attacked departmental corruption and moved officers out of offices and onto the streets. When he arrived, the force numbered 1,280; it is currently approaching 1,700.
"We weren't putting anyone in jail," he said. "Now we are, and we have registered 15 straight quarterly declines in violent and property crime since I reorganized the department. But I don't fool myself; we have a lot more poverty and a lot fewer cops than Washington, which has the same population."
Annual quality of life surveys taken by the University of New Orleans show that more residents think things are getting better than think they are getting worse. Mr. Pennington gets much of the credit; he has an 83 percent approval rating, and many politicians expect him to be the city's next mayor.
But even Mr. Pennington would be hard pressed to revitalize the city's economy. Once the South's largest city, the nation's fifth largest in 1860, New Orleans fell behind Houston in 1950 and has slipped further in the half-century since then. Although it has its share of new skyscrapers, it has been overtaken by Atlanta and Nashville and Charlotte, the economic capitals of the New South. The days when cotton was king here have long since passed, and now the oil boom has ended, too. Most of the local banks are now branches of bigger banks in bigger cities.
"Tourism has become not only the leading industry but the only industry," said Paul Fabry, the retired head of the World Trade Center here. "We are a colonial economy. All the owners of hotels and airlines live somewhere else, and we are left, for the most part, with low-paying jobs -- taxi drivers, waiters, bellmen. And the port? The port is mostly about transferring bulk commodities from ships to barges and barges to ships. We make about as much money from the port these days as the mailman does from the $500 check in his sack."
Mr. Fabry also detects an increasing reluctance on the part of able young people, black as well as white, to remain in New Orleans, and worries where the civic leadership of tomorrow will come from. Not long ago, he said, he asked a group of other older men "who once belonged to the city's elite" how many had children who had left. Three-quarters of them raised their hands.
Still, for every Walter Isaacson, who moved north and became the editor of Time magazine, others move south, attracted by the climate, the cheap, easy living and the good food. In the old days, writers like Tennessee Williams and William Faulkner and Sherwood Anderson spent time in New Orleans. Anne Kearney, the chef at Peristyle, came on vacation in the winter of 1991, two days before Mardi Gras, saw that "the trees were green," got a job and stayed. Virginia Claiborne Miller, whose family has roots in the city, came from Washington and helped start a public relations firm.
"The magic," Ms. Miller told us, "outweighs the provincialism."
 
A Sinking Feeling
People in New Orleans fret about the Formosa termites that attack the old wood houses every May, and they worry about signs that the old city is slowly sinking, like Venice, despite the levees that protect it from floods.
"We're surrounded by water and the land is like pudding," Terrence Fitzmorris, a professor of history at Tulane University, told The Associated Press early this year. "What it's created is a survivors' mentality."
To survive, they eat. And eat.
Eating is a New Orleans obsession; the city has more overweight people for its size than any in America. This is the place brunch was invented, by a certain Mme. Begue, who called it second breakfast. (One wasn't enough for her clients.) Oysters Rockefeller were first served at Antoine's and bananas Foster were created at Brennan's, where you can still order them as the crowning glory to a modest breakfast of baked apple followed by a crawfish omelet.
Friends, meeting in the street, exchange thoughts about where to find the best red beans and rice on Monday, when that homely favorite is traditionally eaten. They flock to favorite holes-in-the wall as well as the white-tablecloth temples of haute cuisine.
They go to Casamento's for oyster loaves, which are baguettes hollowed out and filled with fried oysters. To the Central Grocery for muffulettas, which are sandwiches of Italian cold cuts, cheese and crushed olives on round rolls. To Felix's, where oysters are opened before your eyes and placed on a marble bar, innocent of plate, for your pleasure. To the Camellia Grill, a glorified diner with a mere 29 stools housed in a miniature Tara, for crisp pecan waffles in the morning and cheeseburgers after midnight. To Eddie's or Dooky Chase for gumbo. To the Cafe du Monde, day or night, for another coffee fix.
And they know why they eat what they do. I asked Paul C. P. McIlhenny, whose family firm has made Tabasco for generations, why he and his fellow townsmen liked chicory in their coffee. We were having lunch at Galatoire's, the most traditional of New Orleans restaurants, where the waiters sometimes call their customers, male or female, "cher" or "chere," for "dear."
It started during the Napoleonic war, he explained after he finished a mouthful of oysters en brochette. The British blockaded French ports, so Parisians made do with the roasted and ground roots of endive, which is called "chicoree" in French. When the war ended, almost two centuries ago now, the French went back to the real thing.
"But here in New Orleans," he said, "we never got the message."
Change, as you may gather, comes slowly here. Quint Davis, the producer and director of the city's annual Jazzfest, put it this way: "Here heritage is not something you see in the rearview mirror. It's also shining brightly through the windshield."
 
Party Animals
A big part of that heritage is, of course, Carnival, the explosion of parties, balls and parades that swirls through New Orleans just before Lent every year, ending on Fat Tuesday, the day before the lean days begin. The rhinestones, tulle and masks of Mardi Gras cost an immense amount of money -- hundreds of thousands of dollars to stage one dance among dozens -- and it is all paid for by private citizens, of all classes and races, and the city. No corporate subsidies here.
Originally the domain of the Creole upper classes, descended from the French and Spanish settlers, Mardi Gras has become everyone's property while remaining a tightly orchestrated social ritual. For the grandees, having one's daughter named queen of one of the "krewes," or clubs, ranks among life's great milestones. For simpler folk, black and white, the goal is fun.
One krewe, Babylon, is made up mostly of physicians. Zulu is mostly black. Iris is for women only. Rex is the grandest. The king of Rex is automatically king of Carnival, and for more than a century, he has been a business or civic leader who belonged to the old-guard Boston Club.
If you're not in New Orleans at showtime, you can get a sense of the thing at an excellent Mardi Gras museum housed in the old Presbytere -- one of the historic landmarks on Jackson Square, along with the Cabildo, the Pontalba Apartments and St. Louis Cathedral. Recent parades are shown on videotape. Costumes, floats and favors from years past are on display, along with plastic "go-cups" (so vital for portable booze) and "throws" -- the cheap beads and aluminum "doubloons" that float-riders toss to the crowds in response to the cry, "Throw me something, mister!"
You can also take the city's exuberant pulse every night of the year at jazz and blues haunts like Preservation Hall and the Funky Butt and all-purpose clubs like Tiptina's and the Maple Leaf. The action centers on Bourbon Street, the only street in the Quarter where neon is permitted. It lasts all night. New Orleans has no legal closing hour, and some nightspots are still throbbing when the sanitation men arrive in the dirty white light of morning to clean the debris from the gutters.
Things were particularly wild on our most recent visit. It coincided with Halloween, which attracts people from all over the country, including large contingents of gay men and lesbians, many of whom lavish enormous attention on their costumes. When we ancients gave up the ghost at midnight, the teeming streets of the Quarter looked like a Bruegel fantasy come to life.
 
Jazz, and All That Jazz
The Mardi Gras collection is just part of a trend that threatens to turn New Orleans into a museum town, of all things. The old Mint, a stern gray Greek Revival temple, now houses a small but choice collection of the Arts and Crafts pottery made early in the last century at Sophie Newcomb College for Women, as well as the New Orleans Jazz Collection, a must for any aficionado.
There are photographs of old jazzmen, letters that testify to the hard lives they lived, a map of Storyville "showing the principal sporting houses." Instruments: Johnny St. Cyr's banjo, Irving Fazola's clarinet, Bix Beiderbecke's cornet, the kazoo that Tony Spargo played in the Original Dixieland Jazz Band and, in a place of honor, the trumpet Louis Armstrong learned on.
New Orleans has a small opera company and a symphony orchestra, the Louisiana Philharmonic, patched together a decade ago by the never-say-die musicians of the defunct New Orleans Symphony. Maxim Shostakovich is a frequent guest conductor. But the city's most profound musical passions bubble up from the streets, into jazz and rhythm and blues, brass bands and zydeco, Cajun fiddling and gospel song.
Armstrong, born a century ago, a graduate of a boys' reformatory, is the city's hero, with a park named for him. His global renown eclipsed that of any other American musician. Jelly Roll Morton, Buddy Bolden and Sidney Bechet, also born in New Orleans, were other pioneers of jazz. Mahalia Jackson, the greatest of gospel singers, is the city's favorite musical daughter.
So why did so much music flower first here and not elsewhere?
Lolis Eric Elie, a columnist for The New Orleans Times-Picayune, offered this explanation: "The French here in New Orleans had different conceptions about slavery than the English in the rest of the country. The French let the Africans keep their drums."
A famous battle was fought at New Orleans on Jan. 8, 1815, when Andrew Jackson defeated crack British troops under Maj. Gen. Sir Edward Pakenham at Chalmette plantation. The final battle of the War of 1812, it cemented the American claim to the Mississippi and lifted the young nation's spirits. But if you head downriver to visit the battlefield, remember one of American history's ironies: the battle was fought, and General Pakenham died, after a peace treaty had been signed but before word of it reached the contending armies.
The big military noise in New Orleans more recently has been the debut of the National D-Day Museum, situated here because of a remark Dwight D. Eisenhower made to his biographer Stephen E. Ambrose, a longtime professor at the University of New Orleans. The general asked Professor Ambrose whether he knew much about Andrew Jackson Higgins, a hard-drinking, hard-driving boat builder who invented and built thousands of flat-bottomed, ramp-fronted boats that ferried American troops onto enemy beaches in Italy, Normandy and the Pacific.
"That Higgins," Ike said, "was the man who won the war for us."
"What a comment!" Professor Ambrose said. "What a source!"
 
Evoking the D-Day Landing
Now a new Higgins boat built by some of his 30,000 former employees sits in the atrium of a museum that attracted 175,000 people in its first three months. On the upper floors visitors can view a mockup of a D-Day glider landing, view hundreds of photographs and listen to excerpts from the thousands of interviews Professor Ambrose has conducted with survivors of the invasion and people who worked in the plants that provided them with war materiel.
Across the street, the Taylor Library (1888), the only building in the South by Henry Hobson Richardson, a Louisiana native, is being converted into a museum, and a new building is going up alongside it. They will open in 2001 as the Ogden Museum of Southern Art, showing 1,500 pieces from the collection of Roger H. Ogden, a local businessman. It contains works by well-known artists like Martin Johnson Heade and John James Audubon, by less prominent ones like James F. Pringle, an early marine painter, and by people most of us don't think of as visual artists at all, like Eudora Welty, a gifted photographer as well as a novelist.
Audubon, the great Haitian-born naturalist and painter, lived for a time in New Orleans, and his name is remembered here in that of the Audubon Zoo, one of the city's real ornaments. Upgraded extensively in recent years, it provides vivid glimpses of a wide variety of animals, many of them rare: muscular jaguars with pale, menacing eyes; alligators cruising silently just beneath slimy green waters, with only their eyes showing; tall, spindly red-crowned cranes. Almost all are shown in natural settings, contained by moats and not cages.
 
Sisters and Cousins
The zoo is just beyond the Garden District, which is the architectural showpiece of New Orleans -- block after block of Greek Revival and Victorian houses built in the glamorous antebellum years when this was one of the richest cities in America. Especially interesting are the "Seven Sisters" on Coliseum Street, a series of elegant and fastidiously maintained shotgun houses built on speculation; the three-story house at 1410 Jackson Avenue, with 48 classical columns and 22,000 square feet of living space; and the grand mansion at 2343 Prytania Street. A cast-iron fence whose design copies a cornstalk surrounds the Italianate house at 1448 Fourth Street.
The best of the French Quarter lies downriver from Ursulines Street, well beyond the blare of the Bourbon Street bars, the window-shoppers outside Royal Street's rich antiques shops and the venerable mule-drawn carriages queued at Jackson Square. The Old Ursuline Convent itself, the oldest building in the Mississippi Valley, is just the kind of formal, symmetrical building you find in provincial French capitals; the nearby Gallier House, at 1118-1132 Royal Street, has elegant cast-iron columns and a wonderful wrought-iron balcony.
Finally, the New Orleans Museum of Art merits a few hours of your time, for its superb glass collection, its Paul Storr silver, its three Derains and three Miros, its Gilbert Stuart portrait of Maj. Peter Fort, who fought under Jackson at Chalmette, and much else. But nothing so gripped me as the Degas portrait of his sister-in-law and first cousin, Estelle Musson Degas. The French artist's mother was born here, and he visited the city in 1872 and 1873, producing not only this fine picture but the famous view of his uncle's cotton office, which now hangs in the Musee des Beaux-Arts at Pau in southwestern France.

HEADLINE: POP AND JAZZ GUIDE

 BODY:
A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.
 
BETTY BRILL BUILDING YULE, Fez, 380 Lafayette Street, at Great Jones Street, East Village, (212) 533-2680. Betty, the fierce trio of rocking pop queens, begins a holiday run at this downtown club with carefully twisted versions of holiday pop favorites. Theo of the Lunachicks makes a special appearance. Sundays through Dec. 17 at 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.; admission is $15 (Ann Powers). 

CONJUNTO CLASICO, Copacabana, 617 West 57th Street, Clinton, (212) 582-2672. The classic part of Conjunto Clasico is its lineup of trumpets, percussion and the sharp delicacy of a tres guitar, playing time-tested styles like the son and the Puerto Rican bomba. Through the years the group has nurtured future salsa stars like the singer Tito Nieves. But the momentum it generates on a dance floor is completely contemporary. Tomorrow at 11 p.m., on a bill with Ramon Rodriguez and the 344 Orquestra; admission is $15 before 11, $25 after (Jon Pareles).
 
 MARSHALL CRENSHAW, Bottom Line, 15 West Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 228-7880. Marshall Crenshaw's songs seem to roll off the guitar in a casual blend of pre-1970's styles -- folk rock, surf rock, country and above all the Beatles -- that put melody first. With his winsome tenor, he delves into the ways love goes right and goes wrong, from distant yearning to the aftermath of infidelity, hiding turmoil within the chiming tunes. Lianne Smith and Neill Furio open shows tomorrow at 7:30 and 10:30 p.m.; admission is $20 (Pareles).
 
 GARY BARTZ QUINTET, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232. After 30 years, Mr. Bartz, the burning saxophonist, still has something of an underground reputation; he's always the stealth candidate. It's largely because he hasn't had the wide exposure on records that he deserves, but records never tell the truth anyway. He seems particularly comfortable at this club, so one could rightly expect all the elements to be in alignment. Sets tonight and tomorrow are at 8 and 10:30 p.m. and midnight, with a $25 cover for the first two sets, $18 for the midnight show; Sunday night sets are at 7 and 9 p.m., with an $18 cover; there is a $10 minimum for all shows (Ben Ratliff).10
 
 BORAH BERGMAN QUARTET, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501. Mr. Bergman, the painist whose music is a battering, sometimes exultant form of post-Albert Ayler self-exploration, doesn't play in situations larger than a duo very often, so it's good to see him expanding. Here he is playing with the charismatic violinist Mat Maneri, the saxophonist Louie Belogenis and the drummer Michael Wimberly. Tomorrow at 10 p.m.; admission is $10 (Ratliff).
 
 FREDDIE BRYANT AND KALEIDOSCOPE, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232. This all-around guitarist has played with everyone from Tom Harrell to Charles Earland in jazz, and he has done classical music and a tour with the African pop star Salif Keita, too. But this is his jazz group with a Brazilian cast of mind; he'll mix in Antonio Carlos Jobim with standards. It's part of a free afternoon series at the Jazz Standard aimed at bringing a new, young audience to jazz; no food or drinks are served, and children are encouraged to come. Tomorrow from 2:30 to 4 p.m. (Ratliff).
 
 DEEP BANANA BLACKOUT, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. Working the neopsychedelic jam band circuit, Deep Banana Blackout sets out to fuse Janis Joplin's blues-rock with the funk of the Meters. It pumps out wah-wah vamps while Jen Durkin insists she's ready to "Bump and Sway"; so are the fans. Tonight and tomorrow at 9 p.m.; tickets are $18.50 in advance; $22 day of show (Pareles).
 
 ELECTRIC HOT TUNA, Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 496-7070. The guitarist Jorma Kaukonen and the bassist Jack Casady started Hot Tuna as a side project from the Jefferson Airplane, but it has now outlasted the original band. Mr. Kaukonen plays spiky, fingerpicked blues that calmly contemplate death and loss, still harking back to the Rev. Gary Davis; with Hot Tuna's electric lineup he also unleashes one of the most distinctive solo styles of the psychedelic era, burning with cold like liquid nitrogen. Tomorrow at 8 p.m.; tickets are $35 and $48 (Pareles).
 
 * ELEVENTH DREAM DAY, Mercury Lounge, 217 Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700. Eleventh Dream Day has managed to become a supergroup despite itself. The Chicago-based institution is beloved by aging underground rock fans for its tension-filled guitar-bass-drums crackups, but younger listeners probably know the members' other projects better: the fiery guitarist Rick Rizzo has recorded with Red Red Meat, Palace and Tara Key; Douglas McCombs fingers the bass in Tortoise; and the drummer Janet Beveridge Bean plays a singing country sweetheart in Freakwater. This rare live show will probably feature assistance from other independent stars, like Ira Kaplan of Yo La Tengo. Tomorrow at 9 p.m.; admission is $12 (Powers).
 
 MAJEK FASHEK, Wetlands, 161 Hudson Street, at Laight Street, TriBeCa, (212) 386-3600. Majek Fashek, from Nigeria, puts the loping beat and determined resistance of Jamaican roots reggae at the core of his songs. But he turns the music into his own trans-Atlantic hybrid, using touches of rock guitar and traditional Nigerian talking drums. Sunday at 4 p.m.; admission is $10 (Pareles).
 
 BELA FLECK AND THE FLECKTONES, Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 496-7070. Who but this banjo master would have thought to combine bluegrass with Indian tablas and Tuvan throat singing? With his recent album "Outbound" (Sony), Bela Fleck cements his position among the most adventurous fusion artists in the world. This show should draw a crowd that is part neohippie, part country traditionalist and part New Age jazz sophisticate. Warning to haters of progressive rock: although not scheduled, the singer Jon Anderson of Yes could make a guest appearance to repeat his "Outbound" vocals. Tonight at 8; tickets are $25, $32.50 and $37.50. (Powers).
 
 CHARLES GAYLE TRIO, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501. Mr. Gayle, the saxophonist, has scaled down his terror-tenor style since he established himself on the New York scene in the early 90's and won a scrupulously attentive audience. It's still not straight-ahead jazz by any means, but you're more likely to hear some burnished Coleman Hawkins-style playing than the ghostly, paint-peeling ululations we got used to a decade ago. Mr. Gayle being Mr. Gayle, however, you may get a reading from the Bible or a sermon on homelessness. Tonight at 8; admission is $10 (Ratliff).
 
 * GO-BETWEENS, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 798-0406. "I don't want to change a thing when there's magic in here," sings Grant McLennan on "The Friends of Rachel Worth" (Jetset), the first Go-Betweens album in a dozen years. Things have changed, inevitably, since the Australian band was one of the greatest not to hit the big time back in the 1980's. But Mr. McLennan and Robert Forster are a salt-and-pepper songwriting team, balancing each other perfectly on an album that hurts and heals. If you think the Beatles were good, you're right, but why not check out these secret stars and find out who rules in a parallel universe? Portastatic opens the show. Sunday at 9:30 p.m.; tickets are $12 (Powers).
 
 ARLO GUTHRIE, Carnegie Hall, (2212) 247-7800. Thanksgiving weekend brings the annual appearance by Arlo Guthrie, who honors the American tradition of the tall tale, spinning them in songs and between them. Whether recollecting his past as a shaggy-dog story or inventing narratives for characters, his timing and detail are drolly impeccable. Tomorrow at 8 p.m.; tickets are $23 to $38 (Pareles).
 
 * ROY HAYNES QUARTET, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 255-4037. Mr. Haynes has played the drums with practically everybody of major significance in jazz since the 1940's -- from Louis Armstrong to Pat Metheny, as he likes to say, with a lot of bebop along the way. And he is marvelous, still an unprogrammed, original outrageously swinging musician. He seldom repeats rhythmic patterns; he displaces his band's rhythms, making the music sound as if it's spilling out all over the stage, and he hits the snare so hard and pointedly that he can remind you of a timbalero. Sets through Sunday are at 9:30 and 11:30 p.m., with a 1 a.m. set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $20 (Ratliff).
 
 ABDULLAH IBRAHIM TRIO, Iridium, 44 West 63rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 582-2121. More than any other pianist in jazz, this South African makes music that is still, calm, deliberate; it may be the ultimate expression of the drawing-room or parlor aesthetic in jazz. His sets tend to be movies for the ears with flowed-together themes and vamps, and he is an "I know this from somewhere" composer: his small, tight melodies put you in mind of a Stephen Foster song, an Ellington or Monk melody, a hymn. Sets are tonight through Sunday at 8:45 and 10:45 p.m.; cover charge is $25 and there is a $10 minimum (Ratliff).
 
 * KEITH JARRETT TRIO, New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722. Because of health problelms, Mr. Jarrett has reduced his performing schedule in recent years, but his recent activity suggests improvement: this is the second time he has passed through this area in six months (and many are still talking about his Carnegie Hall show in May). This pianist's highly sensitive touch can make large halls seem intimate, and for improvised commitment, this longstanding trio -- with Gary Peacock on bass and Jack DeJohnette on drums -- is about as good as it gets. Tomorrow night at 8 p.m.; tickets are $14 to $48 (Ratliff).
 
 SHEILA JORDAN AND CAMERON BROWN, Cornelia Street Cafe, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 989-9319. One of the most original singers to emerge in the late 50's and early 60's -- a time that also produced Abbey Lincoln and Jeanne Lee -- Ms. Jordan is still in good form, and she has just released a duet record with the bassist Cameron Brown, "I've Grown Accustomed to the Bass" (Highnote), from which the duo will draw their set. Sunday at 9 p.m.; cover charge is $10 and a one-drink minimum (Ratliff).
 
 * KIKI AND HERB: JESUS WEPT, Fez, 380 Lafayette Street, at Great Jones Street, East Village, (212) 533-2680. How can one describe the genius of Kiki and Herb? It's drag cabaret with the gut-wrenching impact of the best punk rock, the smarts of the snobbiest underground music, and the sick attractions of vintage torch lounge. It's the most hilariously disturbing show you'll see this season. And now the wild chanteuse and her stalwart accompanist are putting on a holiday show! That means they do cruel justice to standards like "Frosty the Snowman" alongside tunes by Belle and Sebastian and Styx. Ms. Kiki (known to the postal carrier as Justin Bond) once more matches Gena Rowlands in Method acting intensity. And the hapless crowd, ducking her advances, loves it. Tomorrow at 6:30 p.m.; tickets are $15 (Powers).
 
 GLADYS KNIGHT, FOUR TOPS, Westbury Music Fair, 960 Brush Hollow Road, Westbury, N.Y., (516) 334-0800. While Ms. Knight's husky alto was one of Motown's underused assets, it also made a lasting impression in songs that gave her a career that lasted well past the 1960's glory days of classic Motown, from "I Heard It Through the Grapevine" to "Midnight Train to Georgia." The Four Tops are equally tenacious. Until Lawrence Payton died in 1997, it was a paragon of group longevity, with the same lineup since 1954. It still has Levi Stubbs's dynamic baritone to charge through Motown classics like "Reach Out, I'll Be There" and "I Can't Help Myself." Tonight at 8; tickets are $50 (Pareles).
 
 VICTOR LEWIS QUINTET, Sweet Basil, 88 Seventh Avenue South, above Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 242-1785. Mr. Lewis is a marvelous drummer, known in the 80's for associations with Stan Getz and Bobby Watson and in the 90's for freelancing and playing with his own band. He has hired important contributors to the modern scene like the saxophonist Seamus Blake, the pianist Stephen Scott and the trumpeter Terell Stafford. Sets through Sunday are at 9 and 11 p.m., with a 12:30 a.m. set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $20 cover, $10 minimum (Ratliff).
 
 MARILYN MANSON, Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 564-4882. Marilyn Manson can't stop thinking about God, violence, fame, mass-media propaganda and deviant impulses. While Eminem has taken over his position as the top pop scourge, he's still a songwriter and showman who's determined to leave a creepy aftertaste. Tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m.; tickets are $30 (Pareles).
 
 MOE, Roseland, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-1224. Moe, from upstate New York, is one of the most invigorating bands on the jam-rock circuit. It keeps adding options to its core of Grateful Dead and Allman Brothers rock: reggae, Little Feat funk, touches of jazz. It's best onstage, where it can turn a minuscule little riff into music that keeps on generating unexpected ideas. Tomorrow at 7:30 p.m.; tickets are $20 (Pareles).
 
 * PINETOP PERKINS, Chicago Blues, 73 Eighth Avenue, below 14th Street, West Village, (212) 924-9755. Pinetop Perkins was the longtime pianist in Muddy Waters's Chicago blues band. He has the entire blues vocabulary in his fingers, from boogie and shuffle bass lines to florid barrelhouse trills and filigrees. But he plays his solos like a card sharp who shows only what he needs to, and his ruthless economy translates into pithy, ornery blues. Tonight and tomorrow at 9:30 and 11 p.m. and 12:30 a.m.; admission is $20 (Pareles).
 
 * SONNY ROLLINS, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144. If stamina's your thing, here's your man. With no sign of letup, Mr. Rollins still plays as if on a dare, sustaining raw power as he unrolls long lines within his epic improvisations. He is often the only soloist in a tune, and the tunes often run long. He has some good new material from a new album, "This Is What I Do" (Milestone),including the Hawaiian standard "Sweet Leilani," which, oddly enough, fits him beautifully. Tomorrow at 8 and 10:30 p.m.; tickets are $40. (Ratliff).
 
 SASHA AND JOHN DIGWEED, Twilo, 530 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 268-1600. A longing for rapture and transcendence is never far from the surface of dance music, particularly in the utopian pulsations set out by the English disk-jockey team of John Digweed and Sasha. They are leaders in trance music, using steady repetition to hold time at bay and floating, whooshing sounds and voices to suggest freedom from the rigors of form. Doors open tonight at 11 p.m., with Sean Cusick warming up and John Digweed and Sasha starting at 1 a.m., continuing well past dawn. Admission is $35. To support the charitable group City Harvest, people bringing three items of canned goods will get reduced admission, and the first 20 people bringing full shopping bags are to be admitted free (Pareles).
 
 DR. LONNIE SMITH TRIO, Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662. The indefatigable organist sets up with the guitarist Peter Bernstein and the drummer Leon Parker for a weekend stay. Sets are tonight through Sunday at 9 and 10:30 p.m. and midnight; cover charge is $15-20, and there is a two-drink minimum (Ratliff).
 
 GREG TARDY QUARTET, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501. The tenor saxophonist Greg Tardy -- who always sounded different from the others, not really a bebop-rooted player, and who has grown from recent associations with the trumpeter Tom Harrell -- had a little shot at recognition with an album on Impulse a few years back, before that operation folded. He is still a figure worth watching, often hooking up with some of New York's best younger musicians. Among those musicians is the pianist Ethan Iverson, who'll be with him for this set. Tomorrow at 8 p.m.; admission is $10 (Ratliff).
 
 McCOY TYNER, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592. Mr. Tyner is the living mainline of jazz, the definer of modern harmony, the course that all developing players must pass through. Despite some lackluster recent albums, he is worth hearing in performance; he is still the music's deepest colorist and conjures a great, thunderous ring from his piano. Sets are tonight through Sunday are at 9 and 11:30 p.m.; cover charge is $35, plus a $5 minimum (Ratliff).
 
 UNCLE BONSAI, Bottom Line, 15 West Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 228-7880. Andrew Ratshin's songs -- with sly observations, twisted premises and intricate three-part high harmonies -- garnered Uncle Bonsai a dedicated cult following on the folkie circuit in the 1980's; the group has reunited for its first New York show in 12 years. Sunday at 3:30 and 8 p.m.; tickets are $20 (Pareles).
 
 PAPO VASQUEZ'S PIRATES AND TROUBADOURS, Up Over Jazz Cafe, 351 Flatbush Avenue, at Seventh Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 398-5413. One of the best trombonists in town -- you've seen him if you've seen the Chico O'Farrill orchestra -- has a smoking new record, "At the Point, Vol. 2" (Cubop). The Puerto Rican bandleader will be playing his new Latin-jazz compositions, which are hotter and less music-school benign than a good deal of the genre. Shows are tonight and tomorrow at 9 and 10:30 p.m. and midnight; cover charge is $18; $5 minimum (Ratliff).
 
 * YO LA TENGO, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, at the Bowery, (212) 533-2111. Yo La Tengo's songwriters, the husband-and-wife team of Ira Kaplan on guitar and Georgia Hubley on drums, prize succinct, tuneful songs about the modest pains and pleasures of daily life and love. From those songs, however, a welter of fuzz-tone and feedback can erupt at any time, like a psychedelic disruption of quotidian reality. The band is sharing double bills with other well-traveled independent-circuit bands that explore longterm couple dynamics. Tonight at 9, with Damon and Naomi opening. Formerly of Galaxie 500, Damon and Naomi have retained their old group's hushed dynamics and searching simplicity. Tickets are $16 (Pareles).

Europe's Central Banker Sees Signs of Slowing

BYLINE: Bloomberg News

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Nov. 23

 BODY:
Wim Duisenberg, the president of the European Central Bank, said today that there were signs of slowing economic growth and inflation, indicating that interest rates might have peaked.
Recent reports "suggest some moderation" in the pace of economic expansion in the second half of this year, Mr. Duisenberg told members of the European Parliament. Inflation in the 11 nations that use the euro is likely to taper off, he said. 
 Germany's economy, Europe's largest, expanded 0.5 percent in the third quarter, less than half the rate of the previous three months, the Bundesbank said today.
German business confidence fell for a fifth straight month in October, a report showed on Tuesday. Rising oil prices and interest rates have increased costs for companies and curbed spending by consumers.
In a separate report today on Britain, which is not part of the euro zone, the nation's economy expanded 0.7 percent, down from 0.9 percent in the second quarter, government figures showed.
The euro's decline has pulled inflation into the region by raising the cost of imported goods.
The currency's weakness is a "cause for concern," Mr. Duisenberg said today in quarterly testimony to the parliament. The exchange rate with the dollar is "out of line with fundamentals," given a narrowing in economic growth rates between the United States and Europe, he said.
Mr. Duisenberg would not comment on speculation that the central bank would intervene in currency markets to bolster the euro, and he said he regretted an interview with The Times of London, which led some investors to speculate that the bank was reluctant to intervene.
He said that the bank was "trying to improve communication" and that process would include the twice-yearly publication of economic forecasts, including gross domestic product and inflation figures.
Even so, he played down a decision to publish economic forecasts that would allow investors a glimpse into the central bank's decision-making process, saying they would not offer a long-term guide to interest-rate decisions.
The euro region's economy is likely to expand 3.2 percent in 2001, compared with 3.3 percent in the United States, the European Commission predicted on Wednesday. This year, the euro zone's gross domestic product is likely to grow 3.5 percent, 1.6 percentage points less than the United States, the European Union's executive agency said. The gap in interest rates has also narrowed, after seven increases in rates by the European Central Bank in a year.

Russia Hopes to Revive Sagging Power Industry

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Nov. 23

 BODY:
After years of dwindling investment and neglect, Russia's power industry is beginning to crumble.
A decade after the fall of the Soviet Union, investment is down by two-thirds, and nearly half of the existing infrastructure has aged beyond its intended life span. With economic growth surging and generation capacity last expanded in the 1980's, Russia needs to modernize fast. 
 To upgrade its sagging infrastructure, built mostly in Soviet times -- portions predate the 1917 revolution -- Russia's monopoly electricity company said it would need $30 billion over the next 10 years. This investment, roughly equivalent to all of this year's federal government spending, is far greater than what local capital markets can provide. The solution, the company said, is to deregulate the industry and sell stakes in newly formed companies to foreign buyers.
"Russia's power sector, its technology and the condition of its equipment, is a disaster," said Anatoly B. Chubais, the chief executive of the national grid company, Unified Energy System. "Russia hasn't just reached the point of needing a restructuring, it has no other choice. The only way to rescue this sector is through private investment."
Russia's post-communist government tried to reorganize the electricity industry during the country's mass privatization in the 1990's. In that initial sale, Russia broke the industry into two layers. Unified Energy, the grid operator, was given almost all the biggest, most efficient power generators, while a second layer of 73 regional companies took weaker generators and local distribution. Foreign portfolio investors, like banks and mutual funds, snapped up stock in both Unified Energy and many of the regional companies during the stock market boom of 1996 and 1997, and now own about a third of Unified Energy.
But that first reorganization failed to generate new investment for the sector or to solve the chronic problem of nonpayment that, until recently, had strangled the industry. Regional companies fell hostage to powerful local politicians who blocked cutoffs and protected large customers who sometimes failed to pay their bills. And though Unified Energy is still one of Russia's most popular stocks, its share price is down more than 75 percent from its 1997 peak, and public offerings on the stock market no longer look like a viable way of raising cash for investment.
There does not seem to be a single, foolproof formula for deregulation, which is a recent development even in countries with well-established market systems. In California, for example, brownouts and soaring electricity prices have followed deregulation. Power cuts can have tragic consequences in Russia, where temperatures in parts of Siberia regularly plunge to 60 degrees below zero in winter, and power lines cross 11 time zones, so would-be reformers must tread carefully.
The aim of the new change is to liberalize Russia's highly regulated market and expand a wholesale market for electricity, where the country's biggest companies could shop around for the best price. Russia's existing federal wholesale market is extremely limited, with only 13 commercial consumers granted the right to buy electricity.
Mr. Chubais's new plan would separate power generators from the distribution companies that deliver power to and collect the bills from the end consumers. These generators, from hydroelectric plants to coal-powered plants, would be grouped into new companies, which would compete among one another for the best customers. In this way, reformers hope that intrusive local politicians would lose their grip on the power companies. Once a rudimentary market is established, Mr. Chubais would begin to sell stakes in those companies to big foreign power companies.
Central to the plan is foreign investment, which Russia has been notoriously bad at attracting. A weak court system, lax contract enforcement and a predatory tax system have deterred many foreign companies from entering Russia. While countries like Brazil brought in about $20 billion in foreign investment during its recent electricity restructuring, it is not clear that investors will have that kind of confidence in Russia.
Current foreign shareholders are among the biggest opponents of the reorganization plan. Investors profoundly distrust Mr. Chubais on a personal level and said they feared a repeat of Russia's earlier asset sales programs, when Mr. Chubais, then the head of the government's privatization committee, sold the best companies to his political allies on the cheap. A recent regrouping of regional energy companies south of Moscow on the Volga River has raised suspicions. Unified Energy said the shift would improve company management. Earlier this week, a leading foreign shareholder announced the government had agreed to change the company's charter to increase scrutiny of Mr. Chubais's plan.
Much of the power industry is still plagued with deep problems. For years, power companies have subsidized the Russian economy by continuing to supply non-paying customers with electricity and accepting a large share of payments they did receive in barter and mutual debt write-offs. That has improved tremendously the last two years as payments in money have risen to 90 percent from a low of 10 percent, aided by an economic recovery and Mr. Chubais's tougher approach to chronic debtors.
Also, electricity prices are still too low to justify large new investments, foreign power companies said. Though prices paid by large industrial companies are rising slightly, individual Russians pay deeply subsidized rates, less than one-tenth the price American consumers pay. Power failures, mostly because of bad management and fuel shortages, are still widespread.
These problems must be resolved, or at least reduced, before Russia begins restructuring, critics said.
"It's trying to run before you can walk," said Scott Foster, director of European power at Cambridge Energy Research Associates in Paris. "You need a functional system where money is flowing, all players are confident, and prices provide a fair return on capital. That's probably still a missing link."
Mr. Chubais, ferociously pro-market, said these problems would resolve themselves as soon as a market was created. His program would push the necessary laws through parliament and create the necessary market infrastructure such as a network administrator by the end of next year.
"The only possible way of attracting private investors is to make a market," said Mr. Chubais. "Current prices aren't inherently bad because they are low, they are bad because they are set in a very wrong way -- by the government."

HEADLINE: Telephone-Related Companies Lead Rise in European Stocks

BYLINE: Bloomberg News

DATELINE: LONDON, Nov. 23

 BODY:
European stocks rose, led by phone-equipment and phone companies like Alcatel and Vodafone as some investors bought the worst performers of the last month. Drug makers including Merck gained amid optimism they would be dependable profit generators as economic growth weakens.
Phone-related stocks "have fallen a very long way, and you can't rule out a sharp rebound," said Jim Stride, who helps manage about 40 billion ($56 billion) at Axa Sun Life Investment Management. "The survivors in the industry will make a lot of money, and consumer demand for telephony is not falling just because the stocks are." 
 Danone climbed after saying it would not bid for Quaker Oats.
The United States stock market was closed for the Thanksgiving holiday, leading to below-average trading volume in Europe.
Alcatel, Europe's No. 2 phone-equipment maker, rose 4.15 euros ($3.50), or 7.4 percent, to 60.5 euros ($51.05), trimming its one-month decline to 20 percent. Vodafone, the world's biggest mobile-phone company, climbed 8.5 pence (12 cents), to 250 pence ($3.52), cutting its slide over the last month to 11 percent.
Merck, Germany's fifth-biggest drug maker, rose 2 euros ($1.69), or 4.4 percent, to 47 euros ($39.66), and AstraZeneca, Europe's No. 1 pharmaceuticals company, climbed 85 pence ($1.20), or 2.6 percent, to 3,345 pence ($47.07).
Phone and computer-related shares surged late in the day. Traders who sold stocks they did not own in the morning, expecting them to fall after the Nasdaq composite index dropped 4 percent on Wednesday, had to buy them back in the afternoon as declines failed to materialize. "There have been a few shorts out there, and the moves this afternoon suggest there was some aggressive buying to cover those positions," said Peter Cogliatti, a trader at Williams de Broe in London. "With thin volumes, that pushed prices quite a bit higher."
Danone added 9 euros ($7.59), or 6.3 percent, to 153.1 euros ($129.19), reversing an earlier decline of up to 4 percent. Danone said it would not pursue a takeover of Quaker Oats.
British American Tobacco lost 33 pence (46 cents), or 6.3 percent, to 492 pence ($6.92). The company's Brown & Williamson Tobacco unit must pay a $750,000 award to an ill smoker after the Florida Supreme Court reversed an earlier appeals-court decision on Wednesday.
While the verdict is small compared with the record $145 billion Miami jury award levied against Brown & Williamson and four other tobacco companies in July, yesterday's decision marks the first time a tobacco award has been affirmed by a state's highest court.
ABN Amro declined 1.37 euros ($1.16), or 5.5 percent, to 23.6 euros ($19.91). The biggest Dutch bank said it would sell shares or assets to finance the $2.75 billion acquisition of National Australia Bank's Michigan National unit, its second purchase in Michigan.
Telecom Italia climbed 0.21 euro (18 cents), or 1.6 percent, to 13.2 euros ($11.14). Italy's biggest phone company said it would sell a stake in a real-estate unit with assets primarily in the nation's three most-populated regions, enabling Telecom Italia to cut its debt by 17 percent.
In European currency trading, the dollar rose against most other major currencies. The euro settled at at 83.88 cents, down from 84.13 cents on Wednesday, and the dollar traded at 110.24 yen, up from 110.14.

HEADLINE: Company Says Tracing Problem Corn May Take Weeks

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
It might take weeks to figure out how the insect-killing trait in genetically altered StarLink corn migrated into a variety of corn that was not supposed to be genetically modified, according to the Garst Seed Company, the producer of the corn.
Garst, which announced on Tuesday that it had encountered the biological mystery while testing samples of corn seed marketed as early as 1998, said it might also take weeks to sort out how widespread the problem was and whether any of the corn had made it into the food chain. 
 Garst's announcement was just the latest twist in a biotechnology controversy that began in September with the discovery that small amounts of corn from StarLink crops, which were supposed to be sold only for animal feed or industrial use, had shown up in taco shells and other food products.
StarLink corn, which was invented by Aventis CropScience, the agricultural division of the Aventis Corporation, contains a gene that produces a protein called Cry9c, which is toxic to corn borers and related insects. StarLink has no known health effects on humans, and similar toxins are widely used in agriculture. But the Environmental Protection Agency decided in 1997 that Aventis's technology should be kept out of human food because laboratory tests indicated that the protein might cause food allergies.
Biotechnology critics jumped on the unauthorized spread this year of StarLink into the food chain as proof of how hard genetically engineered traits are to segregate once they are in the agricultural marketplace. Many critics argue that much of the technology should be banned until stricter controls and better assessments of any potential long-range effects are in place.
Garst's announcement this week opened up a new front in the battle by suggesting that breakdowns in segregation can come even before the seed reaches the farmer.
"This blows a lot of assumptions out of the water," said Margaret Mellon, senior scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington. "How do you regulate risks that manifest themselves even before the product is out there?"
The new controversy involves a strain of corn called 8481 that Garst bred for growing conditions in the heart of the Midwest.
One version of the corn sold in 1998 had the StarLink trait but the other, known as 8481IT, did not. Or so Garst thought. After a few farmers complained that tests showed their supposedly unmodified 8481 carried the StarLink gene, Garst began investigating and concluded that small amounts of StarLink had apparently made their way into 8481IT seed grown in 1997 for the 1998 market.
Garst said it did not know whether the transfer came during pollination as the seed was being grown or through mixing of seeds after harvest. Garst said there was no sign of a similar problem in 8481IT it raised in 1999 or 2000 but that some of the 1998 supply had been stored and sold in those years.
A bit of the 1998 supply might be on the market this year, as well, said Jeffrey W. Lacina, a spokesman for Garst, which is based in Slater, Iowa. But Garst is carefully screening all seed it is selling for the 2001 planting season to make sure that none of it contains the StarLink gene, Mr. Lacina said on Wednesday. Indeed, Garst said its push to make sure that this year's products are pure and to contact anyone who bought 8481 in the past is keeping it from tracking down what happened in 1997 as rapidly as it would like.
The Agriculture Department responded swiftly to Garst's announcement by calling for a meeting on Monday of industry representatives, researchers, policy experts and economists to discuss Garst's findings and the appropriate response. But Garst's timeline for gathering crucial data on the cause and scope of the problem suggests it may be hard to reach any conclusions.
The new controversy is also certain to be felt on Tuesday in Washington when the Environmental Protection Agency holds a meeting on Aventis's petition for an agency ruling that StarLink corn can be accepted in food for the next four years. One of the arguments is that so much of the StarLink corn has been accounted for and directed to permitted uses since the controversy erupted that whatever is left will not be enough to present a food-allergy threat.
The entire 2000 StarLink crop amounted to less than one-half of 1 percent of the nation's corn harvest. Aventis has withdrawn its registration for StarLink, and no new StarLink crops are to be planted in 2001.
A ruling allowing whatever StarLink is in the food chain to simply pass through might save millions of dollars in testing and food recalls. But critics say the 8481 developments this week raise new questions about how far beyond the StarLink crops themselves the potential risks run.

HEADLINE: Aristide's Return: Bad News Perhaps for Him and Haiti

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

DATELINE: MIAMI, Nov. 23

 BODY:
In what opponents call a tragic power grab and supporters a resounding affirmation of the will of Haiti's impoverished masses, former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide is virtually assured of returning to power in elections to be held on Sunday.
That Mr. Aristide is resurgent is the only point of agreement between impassioned supporters and detractors of this former Roman Catholic priest, who became Haiti's first democratically elected president in 1990 and was overthrown in a coup a year later. Still angered over legislative elections last May in which a disputed vote-counting method gave Mr. Aristide's Lavalas Party almost total control in the Senate, all major opposition parties are boycotting this weekend's presidential contest. 
 Also absent will be international observers and any American financing, since the government of Mr. Aristide's handpicked successor, Rene Preval, failed to reach any agreement on reconsidering the results of the May election. Foreign diplomats are suspicious of the political and legal obstacles raised in a process that is clouding the return to power long sought by Mr. Aristide.
Even this week, diplomats said there were indications that Lavalas loyalists were sounding out the opposition about postponing the elections so they could field candidates and make Mr. Aristide's return appear more legitimate. But no official announcement has been made.
"Everything logical calls for them to delay the elections," said a senior American diplomat. "But I think Aristide and the government wants so bad to get it over with and he knows it's not going to be judged as credible no matter what he does. I tend to believe he is going to say, Let's just do it."
The question on most people's minds -- to the extent that Haiti is on anybody's mind in the outside world -- is what happens after the elections. The hopes expressed and the millions of dollars pledged by donor nations and financial institutions after 20,000 American soldiers crushed the coup and restored Mr. Aristide to office in 1994 have long been replaced by weariness over the sometimes violent partisan battles.
Indeed, the only recent heartening development has come from Haiti's wobbly justice system. In the first case of its kind, soldiers were found guilty this month of massacring several residents of Raboteau during the coup. Even more astounding was the fact that the court also ruled against the coup's intellectual authors and leaders, including Raoul Cedras and Roger Biamby, who have been living in exile and who now might be subject to extradition.
However, also this month, Leopold Berlanger, the director of the New Haiti Foundation and the person in charge of Haiti's domestic election observers, was told by a judge that he was linked to the death of Jean Dominique, a popular radio commentator and ally of Mr. Preval.
The accusation, which came from a Lavalas loyalist, said Mr. Berlanger, as well as Leon Manus, the former head of the electoral council, who fled Haiti after May's elections, were part of a cabal plotting an "electoral coup." Diplomats have repudiated the accusation as part of a campaign of intimidation fostered by Lavalas.
But diplomats and others have also faulted both sides for not having been more accommodating in discussions brokered by the Organization of American States to break the impasse.
They have criticized the government for allowing the same electoral commission that presided over the May vote to conduct this weekend's election. And many people have been alarmed in recent weeks as drive-by shootings, robberies and violence have increased, much as they did before May's elections.
It has all contributed to a sense that no one is addressing what is perhaps the country's main problem: how to clear a political space that will allow foreign aid to begin flowing so Haiti can rebuild its crumbling roads, improve its supply of water and electricity and pump up its feeble economy.
"No one is asking what could have been done for Haiti, much less what's being done now," said James Morrell, research director of the Center for International Policy, a Washington group that helped Mr. Aristide during his exile. "Everybody is standing back and washing their hands."
Mr. Aristide himself has stood back, appearing in public only once in recent months, when he registered as a presidential candidate on Oct. 9. He has spent much of the time since he left office at his home in Tabarre, a suburb of Port-au-Prince, where he lives with his wife and two children, receiving visitors and supporters.
His manner has been described as aloof, and onetime supporters -- a growing group -- fault him for being autocratic. Yet, while he is no longer the poor priest who walked among the people, he remains the central figure in Haitian politics when compared with his opponents.
"The opposition, they are affable and engaging, but what about the support of the Haitian people?" said one Clinton administration official. "Are they truly representative of Haitian society or are they just professional politicians who have no constituency? I have no answer to that. I do think we underestimated the support for Aristide."
Ira Kurzban, a Miami lawyer who is Haiti's general counsel in the United States, said American efforts to cultivate opposition candidates, as well as the vilification of the May elections and Mr. Aristide himself by conservative American politicians, reflected a lack of understanding of Haiti's reality.
"Why we do not want Aristide to succeed is a puzzling and complex question," Mr. Kurzban said. "We should want him to succeed because he is the last, best hope for Haiti."
Among those who support him are several people who are suspected of ordering political killings or being involved in the drug trade. Mr. Aristide has not responded to those accusations, although some diplomats who know him well do not believe he himself is tainted.
"There are obvious limits and shortcomings, but I refuse to see him automatically as the devil and to blame on him everything else that is going on in Haiti," said a senior diplomat. "I also think that those who make the leap and think he is all powerful are very wrong. We are dealing with a man who is more aware of his vulnerability than ever."
In fact, diplomats said that one possible source of future weakness may be the political majority he enjoys, since Lavalas already controls the legislature, mayoralties and local councils. Many feel that Lavalas's refusal to reconsider the May election was born of Mr. Aristide's desire to have a Parliament in his thrall, especially since the legislature backed the coup in 1991.
But to gain more legitimacy in the eyes of the international community, diplomats said, he might have to reach out to political opponents and include them in his cabinet.
"He comes into government knowing he needs an opposition," said a senior diplomat who has met often with him.
"If he has no opposition, there is no chance to deflect blame. The irony is, he would be elected in that sense in the worst possible scenario: victory is totally his, so blame would be totally his."

HEADLINE: Blair Criticizes Thatcher, Relegating Her to History

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE

DATELINE: LONDON, Nov. 23

 BODY:
Prime Minister Tony Blair has marked the 10th anniversary of Margaret Thatcher's departure from office by abandoning his usual respectful references to her legacy and attacking her politics as dated and irrelevant to contemporary Britain.
"I take nothing away from those things that were done in the 1980's that we have kept, but it really is time in my view that we move British politics beyond the time of Margaret Thatcher," Mr. Blair told reporters at 10 Downing Street on Wednesday, a decade to the day since she left the official residence in tears after being forced to resign. 
 Mr. Blair had long portrayed Lady Thatcher as a modernizing force and himself as the rightful inheritor of what he called her "conviction" politics, but in his remarks he recast her contribution to modern times as a negative one that held no lessons for him. "We are in a new era," he said. "Today we have to deal with those problems we inherited from that time: the boom-and-bust economics, the social division, the chronic under-investment in our public services."
While Mr. Blair was clearly mindful of the anniversary in timing his remarks, he was also provoked by an outburst the same morning from Lady Thatcher. Talking to reporters, she criticized Mr. Blair for agreeing to commit British troops to a new European rapid reaction force. "It is," she said, "a piece of monumental folly that puts our security at risk in order to satisfy political vanity."
She denounced Mr. Blair for jeopardizing the role of NATO and Britain's close relationship with the United States in the name of cooperating with the other nations of Europe, a proposition she finds dubious.
Relations between the pair were mutually flattering at the time of Mr. Blair's election in 1997 since Lady Thatcher still harbored resentment against her successor, Prime Minister John Major, whom Mr. Blair was working to unseat. And she was heartened by the impression Mr. Blair did nothing to discourage that his Labor Party reforms borrowed heavily from her policies on the economy, public ownership and trade union power.
Mr. Blair recognized that she had succeeded in attracting Britain's aspirational middle class to the Conservatives, and he wanted to lure those people to his New Labor movement. He spoke positively of her focus and said, "It was a clear sense of an identifiable project for the Tory party that I did admire."
Once in office, Mr. Blair continued the calculated courtship, inviting Lady Thatcher to 10 Downing Street and seeking her advice on foreign policy issues like Iraq, Bosnia and Kosovo. She said at the time, "Tony won't let us down."
But two years ago she was quoted as warning, "I'm worried about that young man; he's getting awfully bossy." And last year she irritated the government by taking up the cause of the former Chilean strongman Augusto Pinochet and protesting his arrest and detention in Britain while judicial review of the human rights case against him proceeded.
Wednesday's exchange came during a week in which her dramatic 1990 leave-taking is being recreated in lengthy newspaper articles and television documentaries. The Guardian ran two pages of short interviews with a wide-ranging group of people who recounted where they were at the time and how they heard the news.
In an extended BBC interview, Lady Thatcher herself spoke in icy and unforgiving tones as she remembered the moments leading up to the cabinet rebellion that compelled her to step down. She used words like "smug" and "self-satisfied" to describe her ministers who, she said, treated her "grubbily" as they committed "treachery with a smile."
While she has become an increasingly marginalized figure in Britain, the 75-year-old Baroness Thatcher of Kasteven, as she is known in the House of Lords, attracts adoring audiences on speaking tours abroad, especially in the United States and Asia, places where she finds the same devotion to private enterprise and limited government regulation that she brought to her own country.
Mr. Blair's decision to take her on at home and try to consign her era to history suggested that he believed that she no longer commanded the support of the British middle class and that she was, if anything, a liability to the opposition Conservatives.
In the prime minister's question-time exchange in Parliament on Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Blair derided objections of the Conservative leader, William Hague, to the European military force, saying they could be summed up in six words: "Lady Thatcher -- you lead, I'll follow."

HEADLINE: Effort to Cut Warming Lacks Time And Unity

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN

DATELINE: THE HAGUE, Friday, Nov. 24

 BODY:
The vise tightened sharply early this morning on negotiators seeking a treaty to curb global warming, yet many delegates, even as they headed into the final 24 hours of talks, said they remained far from consensus.
Disputes festered among blocs of countries large and small, rich and poor, over what rules, tools and penalties should be used to stem the flow of heat-trapping greenhouse gases. Scientists say those gases, from smokestacks, tailpipes, and burning forests, are contributing to a potentially calamitous warming trend. 
 Some bleary-eyed lobbyists from private environmental groups said they saw progress in the form of a summary of key sticking points distributed late Thursday night. It contained language that they said could protect the atmosphere and satisfy the interests of dozens of countries.
"It seems to take care of the two worst ends of this environmentally," said Kalee Kreider, the director of climate programs for the National Environmental Trust, a private group based in Washington. And some delegates said that the penalties for failing to meet commitments under the treaty appeared to be largely ironed out.
But some delegates, environmental groups, and lobbyists representing businesses affected by provisions governing fossil-fuel use said the summary still contained land mines that could destroy the effort.
The proposed treaty, the Kyoto Protocol, was drafted by more than 170 countries in 1997 in Japan, and this session was intended to complete the fine print. If enacted, it would commit three dozen industrialized countries to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 2012 to at least 5 percent below emissions in 1990. So far, no industrialized countries have ratified the pact.
The European Union and the United States remain far apart on key provisions, including the amount of credit a country could get by investing in climate-protection projects abroad and how much credit toward emissions cuts could be gained by using forests to absorb carbon dioxide.
And developing countries, including giants like China and oil exporters like Saudi Arabia, pressed for large payments from industrial powers to help them adapt to impending changes in climate and sea level.
"They have caused the problems, they have made the whole world unsafe," said Sani Daura, the Nigerian minister of the environment. "We have the highest stakes, and unfortunately they have not been able to come to terms with our concerns."
Many environmental campaigners had complained about parts of the treaty that they said would allow countries to get credit toward emissions goals simply by protecting existing forests, which sop up carbon dioxide, the dominant greenhouse gas.
They had also denounced treaty language that would allow rich countries to buy emissions credits from Russia, which gained the credits simply because its economy -- and emissions -- had shrunk after the fall of Communism.
Both options would be constrained under the fresh summary of the text, which was issued late Thursday night by Jan Pronk, the president of the meeting, called the Sixth Conference of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol, better known here as Cop 6.
Through the first nine days of the two-week meeting, Mr. Pronk, the gruff, plain-spoken Dutch environment minister, assumed the role of referee, public advocate, and cattle prod, pressing legions of delegates to work late into the night to hash out details.
After hearing from the main negotiating blocs, he distilled their essential positions into 13 slim pages, prompting hundreds of delegates, lobbyists, and observers to sprawl on the blue carpet, sifting the text for problems or progress.
The summary infuriated some delegates from wealthier countries, who saw a heavy-handed effort to impede plans for an unfettered trading system that would allow one country to get credit toward emissions goals for investing in cleaner power plants or other new technologies abroad.
But Mr. Pronk, at a news conference Thursday night, said the summary was a pragmatic effort to cut through competing interests.
One sign that a compromise might be achievable was the observation by many participants that no one seemed particularly satisfied.
"We need a decision, a decision on all key issues," said Mr. Pronk, who turned the screws at a news conference Thursday night by noting that the meeting hall had to be vacated for a convention by Saturday afternoon.
The environmental and financial stakes are enormous, with the treaty constituting a pioneering effort to create a binding agreement under which industrialized countries would not only cut emissions, but invest billions of dollars in projects in poorer countries to prevent new emissions as their economies grow.

HEADLINE: Plan to Revise Zoning Laws Seems to Face An Early Death

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Not long after Donald J. Trump's plans to build the world's tallest residential building near the United Nations ignited a well-heeled protest, the Giuliani administration responded by moving to reshape New York's byzantine zoning code and, ultimately, the city's skyline.
Two years later, Trump World Tower is nearly complete and the plans to overhaul the city's zoning laws for the first time in 40 years are nearly dead. 
 "It's in the intensive-care unit," said Michael Parley, a zoning consultant for many residential developers. "As with anything else in the I.C.U., it could die or make a miraculous recovery."
Few are betting on a miracle.
The story of how an initiative that began with so much promise ran into the opposition of powerful developers illuminates the intersection of politics and real estate in a city that prides itself on its towers.
The proposal sought to impose height limits on buildings in most neighborhoods while restricting the transfer of development rights, a practice that had enabled developers to put up buildings whose height exceeded the usual limits.
The plan to set height limits won early endorsements from community boards, good-government groups and newspaper editorial boards. They all favored overhauling the convoluted regulations that they said allowed developers to erect oversized towers and austere plazas that robbed neighborhoods of street life and resulted in chaos.
But earlier this year, Bernard H. Mendik, chairman of the Real Estate Board of New York and a close friend of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, led a frenzied opposition, telling the mayor and top City Hall advisers in a series of meetings that the zoning revision was a potential disaster that would halt development. His message found an audience in the City Council. Most of the Democratic and Republican Council members get political contributions from the real estate industry, and Speaker Peter F. Vallone is expected to run for mayor next year.
Last month, Joseph B. Rose, chairman of the City Planning Commission and the architect of the proposed zoning changes, suddenly postponed a commission vote on the changes until January for what he said were technical reasons. He has insisted that the measure is still on track, although many real estate executives, several Council members, a senior official at City Hall and a sympathetic planning commissioner have privately pronounced it dead.
Advocates fear that the measure will quietly disappear next year as the city's budget talks take center stage and Mr. Giuliani enters the final months of his administration.
While Mr. Rose was able to mollify some nonprofit institutions that had opposed his plans, Mr. Mendik and the Real Estate Board never backed off their opposition. Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board, said the zoning proposal was not dead yet. But, he noted, "I think it's very significant that the mayor hasn't embraced the proposal.
"New York City should not be a city of height limits," he said. "This proposal will discourage any real attempt to develop in emerging neighborhoods. It's too restrictive and it does not have a vision for the city's future over the next couple of decades."
Mr. Mendik's office referred calls to Mr. Spinola.
Kent Barwick, president of the Municipal Art Society, still holds out hope for the overhaul of the 970-page zoning code, which his group describes as "profoundly destructive of New York's neighborhoods." Mr. Barwick says the revision will simplify the zoning code and close loopholes, the kind of oversights that have resulted in slablike buildings that turn pleasant streets into unpleasant jumbles.
Deputy Mayor Anthony P. Coles, who oversees planning and zoning matters, did not return numerous calls requesting comment, and Mr. Rose declined to be interviewed.
The plan to overhaul the zoning code was announced by Mr. Rose in a speech at City Hall in April 1999. The previous year, Mr. Trump unveiled his plans for Trump World Tower, an 856-foot monolith at First Avenue and 47th Street. Using development rights from other properties on the block and a zoning bonus that allowed for a 20 percent larger building in return for a plaza, Mr. Trump was able to design a tower that rose 310 feet higher than the United Nations.
Had the proposed zoning changes been in effect, they would have required a bulkier building no taller than 495 feet.
Mr. Rose said at the time that his intention was to simplify an arcane zoning code so that it was both coherent and easily intelligible to encourage more innovative designs. The proposal set height limits outside Manhattan's business districts and eliminated bonuses for plazas at new buildings. He said he wanted to encourage development and provide a clear idea of what was permitted in any neighborhood to avoid an uprising by local residents who have in the past pushed the City Council to adopt overly stringent zoning rules.
Mr. Rose formally submitted the text of the proposal in December, with support from the city's community boards, the Municipal Art Society, the American Planning Association, the American Institute of Architects and others. The Real Estate Board seemed to want to avoid a public battle and to be putting aside its objections when it published an advertisement in January stating, "We see this as more positive than negative."
But over the next six months, Mr. Mendik, the chairman of the Real Estate Board, expressed increasingly vehement criticism. Leonard Litwin and Donald Zucker, two major residential landlords, joined Mr. Mendik in leading the industry's opposition. They were particularly incensed by the proposed height limits in medium-density districts like Harlem, the Lower East Side and parts of Queens, the very neighborhoods where developers expect to start new projects, because there are few places left in prime areas.
While the Real Estate Board and the State Association for Affordable Housing complained that prohibiting new 18- to 24-story apartment houses would make development economically impossible, Mr. Rose said current zoning would not permit those towers in many neighborhoods anyway.
"It's a struggle about the next wave of development," said Mr. Barwick of the art society. "It has a lot more to do with the Lower West Side, Harlem, the Lower East Side and sections of Queens than the traditional battlegrounds."
Commercial developers have largely stayed out of the fray. After all, Mr. Rose's proposal had left the Midtown and downtown business districts untouched.
"The zoning code's a mess," said Douglas Durst, who recently built a 48-story skyscraper in Times Square. "While this is not exactly what I want, it goes in the right direction. The height limits are not a problem."
Daniel J. Kaplan, an architect at Fox & Fowle, designed two buildings for a site at Varick and Canal Streets, one meeting the existing regulations and the other the proposed revisions, allowing him to present a comparison to his client, Trinity Real Estate. In a letter to Mr. Rose, the architect said the new regulations would result in a "superior building" architecturally and economically.
But Mr. Mendik was a formidable opponent, both because he represents the real estate industry, which together with Wall Street accounts for the bulk of most candidates' political contributions, and because of his longstanding relationship with the mayor.
"Mendik has the ability to get Giuliani on the phone when the real estate industry wants to get to the mayor," said one former member of the Giuliani administration. "They're very good friends."
City Hall officials and real estate executives say the Real Estate Board was emboldened in the spring when Mr. Rose's chief supporter, Deputy Mayor Randy Levine, left City Hall, and the mayor seemed to lose interest in zoning and other issues after he was diagnosed with prostate cancer and dropped out of the Senate race. Mr. Rose never rebuilt a consensus within City Hall, where many top officials were convinced by Mr. Mendik, Mr. Litwin and Mr. Zucker that the proposal was seriously flawed.
Mr. Rose made a critical error last year, some City Hall officials and real estate executives suggested, when he chose to propose the changes rather than getting Mayor Giuliani to do it.
"The mayor should have been the one to announce it," said a former administration official. "Anything that has any chance of survival -- crime reduction, welfare reform and child health initiatives -- was introduced by the mayor."
Mr. Rose's proposal also faced problems in the City Council, which must vote in favor of the plan before it can be adopted. Staff workers and members of the Council said Mr. Vallone, the speaker, had little enthusiasm for a proposal that was being condemned by the real estate industry and had little apparent support from the Giuliani administration. On real estate controversies, said Norman Adler, a political consultant, Mr. Vallone risks losing the votes of community activists, and contributions from developers and landlords.
"It put Vallone in a tough spot," added one civic advocate who requested anonymity. "He'll be in a tough race. He doesn't want to turn his back on big contributors."
Chris Collins, counsel to the Council's Land Use Committee, said Mr. Vallone would not take a formal position on the matter until the proposal was presented to the Council.
Advocates of a zoning overhaul still hope that a compromise can be worked out before the Planning Commission votes on the proposal and sends it to the Council. But with no discernible push from City Hall, the proposal's fortunes are dim, one crucial councilman said.
Walter L. McCaffrey, chairman of the Council's zoning subcommittee, said, "The lack of tenacity indicates a divided administration, and therefore, a weak proposal."

HEADLINE: Ad Companies Fight to Take Messages to the Streets

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON

 BODY:
On a dark, wet November afternoon, the twisting old street in the financial district is packed. Along with pedestrians bearing umbrellas, there are a tour bus, taxis, some dark sedans and, smack in the middle of them all, a huge white double-sided billboard mounted on the back of a truck. "Point and Klimt," it reads. "Art.com."
There could easily be some dispute about whether the billboard truck is a cause of the gridlock or its victim. But there is definitely a big dispute, taking place in the city's courts, about whether billboard trucks should be on the streets at all. 
 For at least a year, New York City has been enforcing its century-old ban on mobile billboards and has issued summonses to the drivers of billboard trucks. Two billboard companies have challenged the ban, saying it violates their constitutional right to free speech. So far, four judges have made rulings in the cases -- at least one in favor of a mobile billboard company -- and the legal battles continue.
Similar disputes are occurring in Boston and in San Francisco, which suspended enforcement of its ban on mobile billboards in June because of a lawsuit, said Nathan Ballard, a deputy city attorney there. But San Francisco recently revised its law to explain the rationale behind it (to cut traffic congestion, truck emissions and assaults on citizens' aesthetic sensibilities). Unless the billboard company succeeds in persuading a judge to issue a preliminary injunction by Dec. 1, he said, San Francisco will resume enforcing its billboard ban.
At issue here are not delivery trucks that just happen to advertise the companies whose stores they stock (think D'Agostino or Duane Reade) or whose products they haul (Coca-Cola or The New York Times). Billboard trucks have little or no cargo space; there's no room, what with the 10-foot-high placard attached behind the truck cab.
The mobile-billboard imbroglio is a product of trends in traffic and in advertising. It also has to do with the Internet and with advances in satellite technology.
But the idea of advertising trucks goes way back. It was in 1882, the year Franklin Delano Roosevelt was born, that his distant cousin, Alderman Robert B. Roosevelt (uncle of Teddy) proposed the ban on mobile advertising vehicles, which in those days mainly meant horse-drawn wagons.
The Board of Alderman adopted an ordinance "that no advertising trucks, vans or wagons shall be allowed in the streets of the City of New York, under a penalty of ten dollars for each offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the putting of business notices upon ordinary business wagons so long as such wagons are engaged in the usual business or regular work of the owner, and are not used merely or mainly for advertising."
The law has been tinkered with over the years; "motor vehicles" were added, buses and taxis were eventually exempted. The law has been challenged, and was upheld by the United States Supreme Court in 1911 and 1949. But a lot has changed, practically and legally, in the last half century, and the court might see the issue differently now.
The whole billboards-on-wheels thing did not get going until 1986, when these trucks, popular in Europe, began plying the streets of Manhattan. Traffic officials, worried about gridlock, threatened to issue summonses.
Maybe it was the ensuing recession, but somehow, billboard trucks were not a big hit in the advertising world until the late 1990's, when two things happened. One was the advent of Global Positioning System units, which let advertisers tell where the trucks were at all times. That reassured clients that the trucks were really on the streets, not sitting in a garage, and allowed them to calculate roughly how many people see a mobile billboard each day.
The other was the boom in Internet companies, which were looking for offbeat ways to get their messages to consumers. "The real key was the explosion of dot-com marketing," said Valerie Heys, an executive of SRDS, a company based in the Chicago area that publishes a sort of yellow pages for companies seeking "out-of-home advertising" options. In 1997, the directory listed just 8 mobile billboard companies nationally; today, it lists about 25.
Of course, many of the free-spending dot-coms have now gone to that great Internet portal in the sky -- but not before convincing more traditional advertisers like brokerage firms and fashion houses that mobile billboards are a great way to get attention.
"There's always a silver lining; dot-coms really reinforced how effective out-of-home advertising is," said Robert F. Rukstalis, managing director of Massivemedia Inc., which recently had two billboard trucks out advertising the New York State lottery. (He says, by the way, that his trucks have never received a summons.)
Billboard trucks can cost a lot less than fixed billboards, which in good locations can cost tens of thousands of dollars a month. A mobile billboard might cost $1,000 a day.
It is hard to say exactly how many billboard trucks there are on the streets of New York. Paul M. Hellegers, a lawyer who represents one billboard company, Target Advertising, said his clients estimate that no more than a half dozen are active on any given day.
Nevertheless, mobile billboards often seem to be everywhere that crowds are -- driving down Fifth Avenue, crawling through Times Square, circling Shea Stadium.
Not everyone is happy about their presence. Citystreets, a pro-pedestrian group, urges supporters to write to the companies that advertise on the mobile billboards, to complain that their ads increase pollution and traffic congestion. Advertisers think "this is a new, hip way to reach urban people," said Harris Silver, founder of Citystreets. "But for any New Yorker, this touches them the wrong way."
City officials, and traffic officers, are also paying more attention as billboard trucks "get on the radar screen, become a little more common," said Stephen Freitas, chief marketing officer for the Outdoor Advertising Association of America. "The most significant litigation is in New York."
One case involves Target Advertising, which got a summons on Nov. 9, 1999, for operating a billboard truck, advertising a jeweler, at Eighth Avenue and West 41st Street during the morning rush, according to a decision by Judge Gabriel W. Gorenstein in New York City Criminal Court. Another truck was ticketed at Broadway and West 36th Street, and Target picked up a third summons for a truck at Broadway and West 44th Street.
Mr. Hellegers, Target's lawyer, asked Judge Gorenstein to dismiss the summonses, arguing that if the government is going to limit a commercial organization's free speech, it must spell out the public purpose in doing so. Alderman Roosevelt and his peers failed to do that back in 1882, Mr. Hellegers contended.
Judge Gorenstein disagreed, ruling in May that "it cannot be doubted that the city's purpose in enacting this rule was to promote traffic safety and alleviate traffic congestion." He refused to dismiss the summonses. But in September, Judge Arthur M. Schack dismissed nine summonses against Target, calling them unconstitutional.
An appeal appears likely. "The theory for prosecuting these is that traffic congestions is of concern to the city," said Barbara Thompson, a spokeswoman for the Manhattan district attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau.
Meanwhile, Streetblimps Inc., one of the biggest billboard-truck companies, has challenged a summons it received in New York; it is also behind the lawsuits in Boston and San Francisco. Douglas J. Frantin, the company's president, did not return repeated telephone calls, and its lawyer, Richard A. De Palma, could not be reached for comment.
According to court documents, Streetblimps has challenged the billboard ban on various free-speech grounds; in August, Judge Ellen M. Coin, sitting in Criminal Court, ruled that the ban is constitutional as applied to commercial advertising, although she held that Streetblimps could legally operate trucks carrying advertising for political campaigns or nonprofit groups. A State Supreme Court justice, James P. Sullivan, upheld her decision on Oct. 30, and Streetblimps has appealed, according to the district attorney's office.
Even if New York City succeeds in banning mobile billboards from the streets, the creative minds of the advertising world will continue to find ways to use Manhattan's byways to grab attention for their clients. Chalking ads on sidewalks seems to be hot right now, as does parading signs past the sets of early-morning television programs that use the city streets as backdrops.
Nic Denyer, national sales manager for Massivemedia, said he recently asked a police officer what he should tell his employees not to do as they paraded outside the set of ABC's "Good Morning America" in Times Square, trying to get their signs on television. "You can't give me money," Mr. Denyer said the officer replied, "and you can't kill anyone."

HEADLINE: E-Commerce Dream Proves the Undoing Of a Solid Business

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL

DATELINE: RANDLEMAN, N.C.

 BODY:
Just before midnight, Larry K. Canoy steps into his truck to drive an hour to his father's trailer, where he will spend the night. Neither the commute nor the accommodations are ideal, but Mr. Canoy has been cutting back on expenses, like rent, since the new economy upstarts came to town and turned his world on its head.
Until recently, Mr. Canoy and 65 colleagues worked at Shaw Furniture Gallery, a fixture for six decades in this industrial town of 4,000 near High Point, North Carolina's furniture capital. The store closed after being swept up in a dot-com revolution, leaving Mr. Canoy and some co-workers in perilous financial straits. 
 But it was not that Shaw was bested by an Internet competitor. Rather, the company was done in by an Internet partner that promised to make Shaw, one of the 10 largest furniture stores in North Carolina, part of the biggest furniture outlet the world had ever seen.
"They tried to high-tech us rednecks," said Mr. Canoy, 39, turning back from the 1996 Toyota 4Runner he may soon return to creditors. "But they ruined us."
Dot-com failures and layoffs are increasingly common, as investors shed ventures unlikely to meet once-lofty expectations. Yet the bankruptcies of Shaw Furniture and its partner, Living.com, stand apart, and not merely because they took place far from New York or Palo Alto.
Theirs was a union marked by the collision of two worlds. When Living.com acquired Shaw last year to gain a toehold in the furniture business, Internet entrepreneurship came face to face with the rigid, traditional world of home furnishings. Technology-savvy M.B.A.'s intersected with hands-on sellers of sofa beds.
And the difference that counted most may have been how the partners measured success. Living.com was designed to be a billion-dollar company, its name whispered in the same breath with Amazon.com, returning tens of millions of dollars to its investors. In the end, though, company executives issued a statement saying that those returns would not materialize any time soon and that investors were unwilling to wait.
For its part, Shaw was accustomed to earning a profit, albeit a modest one compared with the aspirations of many Internet start-ups. Before the takeover, it expected to sell $20 million this year in merchandise, earning $1 million in profits and paying its top sales people $70,000. And it might have continued that course had its fate not become tied to a plan to move the furniture business into the 21st century.
"They had every C-blank-O you can imagine -- C.E.O., C.F.O., C.M.O.," said Mark A. Milligan, a former general manager of Shaw, who is presiding over its bankruptcy liquidation. "I remember one of them made the statement, 'We're going to revolutionize the furniture industry.' "
"I just rolled my eyes and said, 'Get a clue,' " he continued. "You're not going to come in here like a bunch of cowboys and change the way we've been doing business for 100 years."
Or in the case of Shaw, for 59 years. George F. Shaw started the company in 1940 to sell inexpensive furniture to mill workers who lived near the Deep River. It became a fixture in Randleman, the hometown of the Petty family of stock car racing fame. Shaw grew steadily, and became a discount hub. Out-of-towners arrived in Lincoln Town Cars and Range Rovers to peruse showrooms full of oak, pine and maple bedroom and dining room sets, sofas and chairs made by top furniture lines, then order the pieces for delivery. Shaw did much of its sales by phone to out-of-state buyers.
As it had been for 58 consecutive years, Shaw was profitable in late 1998 when Sherrill W. Shaw, George's son, who owned the company and was nearing retirement, received an offer from Living.com. In March 1999, Living.com took ownership of the gallery for a price that Mr. Shaw said was over $5 million; he declined to be more specific.
A father-and-son team was also behind Living.com. Andrew Busey, 29, who had already started and sold a successful Internet business, was chief executive. His father, Jay Busey, 60, who had spent 37 years in furniture business, became the chief of the Shaw subsidiary.
The Buseys deemed the Shaw acquisition crucial because they figured it would give them access to top furniture lines. Manufacturers had resisted selling on the Internet, acceding to dealers who said they should not have to compete against virtual entities that did not have to spend millions on showrooms.
Meanwhile, the Buseys were also courting investors, with marked success. They attracted about $70 million from sources like Benchmark Capital, a Silicon Valley venture capital fund, and Starbucks, and signed a deal to become the exclusive home furnishings retailer on Amazon.com.
As part of the deal with the venture capitalists, the younger Mr. Busey stepped aside as chief executive of Living.com and became chairman. The new chief was Shaun Holliday, the former chief executive of Guinness Ireland. Former executives from Kellogg and America Online joined them at the company's headquarters in Austin, Tex.
Asked for his account of the demise of Living.com and Shaw, the younger Mr. Busey declined to comment. His father cited the failure of the financial backers to pay close attention to the inner workings of the furniture business. Company backers, including Benchmark Capital and Amazon.com, did not respond to requests for interviews.
In any case, even after Living.com started its site in July 1999, there was no immediate sense that the old and new businesses were on a collision course. At first, some of the impact was even welcomed in Randleman.
Under Mr. Shaw, employees say, they wore ties to work. Under Living.com, dress was casual. Living.com stocked Shaw's break room with free snacks and sodas. Living.com also gave a few hundred to a few thousand stock options to Shaw employees. Mr. Canoy, who joined Shaw in 1984 working in the warehouse, received several hundred.
A tall, earnest man, who drove a company delivery truck before hurting his back carrying an armoire and then moved to sales, Mr. Canoy said he planned to use the options to save for college tuition for his 5-year-old daughter. He figured sales calls referred from Living.com's Web site would bolster the $4,000 he typically earned each month in commissions, and help pay expenses, like the $400 a month he owed in child support.
But the warm feelings between the companies did not last long.
Within two weeks of the site's introduction, most major furniture makers, under pressure from retailers, refused to let Living.com sell their products. The Web site was able to carry a mere 20 percent of the inventory that Shaw was allowed to sell over the phone, leaving Living.com to sell inexpensive, lower-quality lines, Mr. Milligan said.
Shaw was still allowed to sell all lines -- if, that is, it could fill the orders. The trouble was that Living.com upgraded Shaw's computer, telephone and shipping systems and sought to integrate them with a huge call center that Living.com built 16 miles away in Greensboro. The results were disastrous.
Shaw's old computer system, designed for furniture industry sales people to check prices, place orders and track inventory, was replaced with a state-of-the art Oracle database system. Unfortunately, sales people often could not find an item's price in the computer. The system also falsely reported whether an order was in stock or had been shipped.
"It was a nightmare trying to track things," said John Timothy Shepard, 46, a salesman. He recalled one incident where he could not find the status of a $19,000 order. "We found a part of the order to ship, but not the rest. The next week we found the second part of the order, but couldn't find the first part."
Living.com sent help -- lots of it. During one two-month period, Oracle sent 10 consultants to Randleman, who worked seven days a week at a cost of $150 to $200 an hour to try to fix the system, Mr. Milligan said.
When orders were successfully placed, the real trouble began. To speed deliveries, Living.com decided to change Shaw's shipping company. But according to Mr. Milligan, the new company was inexperienced in shipping furniture. Dressers were returned with holes, desks with sides ripped off, headboards split in two. The company wound up with a return rate as high as 30 percent, he said.
In addition to sharing Living.com's computer system and delivery service, Shaw was also sharing its expenses. Mr. Milligan said Shaw's revenue was siphoned off to pay the parent company's bills. This is hardly atypical of a subsidiary, but the result was that Shaw found it lacked money to pay furniture manufacturers. Several cut off shipments.
Worst of all, Mr. Milligan and the elder Mr. Busey, who resigned in June, said the Living.com executives in Austin would not listen to any counsel from Randleman about how to operate a furniture business. "They wanted to strategize and theorize and not listen to what really went on," Mr. Busey said.
Mr. Milligan said that one day on a conference call to Austin, he played voice mail messages from three Shaw customers irate they had not received orders or had received damaged goods. He quoted Mr. Holliday, the chief executive, as saying, "We really have to make some changes." But, Mr. Milligan said, "It was forgotten the next day."
Living.com declared bankruptcy on Aug. 29. The parent company laid off 275, in addition to Shaw's staff. Left in the lurch were 300 to 400 customers who say they have not received either furniture or reimbursement for payments they made. Their claims are being reviewed as part of the bankruptcy proceedings.
Many Shaw employees have found new jobs, in some cases joining Shaw's competitors. Sales people who earned $4,000 a month say they are scraping by with incomes of less than $1,000. Several may lose homes and cars.
To cut costs, Mr. Canoy is moving out of the farmhouse he rented for $250 a month. He has told his daughter they "won't have a Christmas this year."
In the end, Mr. Canoy said, what galls him is that Living.com spent so much money to accomplish so little. "They destroyed us," he said.
"They walked in here with $70 million and couldn't make it happen," he said. "Think about it: $70 million. And within 13 months, it was gone."

HEADLINE: Rethinking Negotiation With Hitler

BYLINE: By BENJAMIN SCHWARZ

 BODY:
Although Americans have embraced Winston Churchill as one of the great statesmen of the 20th century, he has never enjoyed unqualified adulation in his own country.
A maverick -- or, less charitably, a political turncoat -- Churchill was and still is regarded by many of his fellow Tories as an opportunist and a grandstander. And the British left could never stomach his arch-imperialism and pronounced reactionary streak. Nonetheless, for a long time everyone in Britain seemed to agree that Churchill was, as the great left-wing historian A. J. P. Taylor anointed him, "the savior of his country," the man who defiantly led the British people in their seemingly hopeless resistance to Hitler. 
 Even this image of Churchill, though, has been under assault. Most recently Frank Johnson, a columnist and former editor of The Spectator, the venerable conservative weekly, aroused enormous controversy this spring when he raised a question in the magazine that historians have been debating for more than a quarter century: Did Churchill consider negotiating with the Nazis in 1940?
That debate is part of another, wider and even more acrimonious one among British historians and political figures: Should Churchill have negotiated a compromise peace with Germany?
The argument revolves around the confusing and inconclusive records of deliberations in Churchill's cabinet in May and June 1940 over whether Britain should discuss peace terms with Germany, records over which historians have argued for the 30 years that they have been available.
There is no disagreement that the cabinet debated whether Britain should sound out Hitler on what kind of peace terms he might offer. Nor is there any doubt that Churchill made comments that do not entirely support his image as the stalwart hero, pursuing the goal of "victory at all costs" and refusing even to contemplate negotiations with Berlin. He is recorded as declaring, for example, that "if we could get out of this jam by giving up Malta and Gibraltar and some African colonies," he would "jump at it," although he didn't see any such prospect. He also declared that he was prepared to accept "peace on terms of the restoration of German colonies and the overlordship of Central Europe," which presumably included continued occupation of Czechoslovakia and western Poland, although, again, he said that such an offer was "most unlikely."
The question is how to interpret these remarks. To historians like John Lukacs, the author of several books on the period, and Martin Gilbert, Churchill's official biographer, who depict Churchill as an uncompromising hero, such remarks are evidence only of Churchill's extraordinary political skill. Consider the context. Churchill made those statements during debates with his foreign secretary, Lord Halifax, one of the most ardent advocates of appeasement in the 1930's. Halifax was trying to convince the cabinet that Britain should immediately send out feelers to Hitler, arguing that if negotiations were conducted at all, the sooner they got started the better, since peace terms were likely to be more acceptable while France was still in the war and before British aircraft factories were bombed. Thus, Churchill's argument to wait for better terms was actually a way of warding off Halifax's plea to enter negotiations immediately. Talk of peace was merely a debating tactic.
Revisionist historians like Sheila Lawlor, director of the British think tank Politiea; Clive Ponting, a professor at the University of Swansea, Wales; and Andrew Roberts, Halifax's biographer, say there is little evidence for that interpretation in the historical record. Halifax, they argue, wasn't a craven defeatist. He simply did not understand that by late May of 1940 there was very little that Britain and France could offer Hitler that he was not already in a position to seize. Churchill, on the other hand, recognized that, at the very least, Britain had to maneuver into a better bargaining position, saying, "A time might come when we felt that we have to put an end to the struggle, but the terms would not then be more mortal than those offered to us now."
What people forget, the revisionists argue, is that during the cabinet debates in May 1940 every British policy maker assumed that, without a negotiated settlement, the quarter-million British soldiers trapped at Dunkirk would be killed or captured. They also argue that the idea of an armed truce with Germany didn't carry the same moral odium it does today. (Even Churchill speculated in 1935 that Hitler "will go down in history as the man who restored honor and peace of mind to the great Germanic nation"). Finally they argue that in May 1940 Britain was under even more severe economic and military constraints than those that had inspired the appeasement policies of the 1930's. Continuing the war would itself inexorably bring an end to Britain as an independent power through national bankruptcy. Indeed, the inevitability of economic collapse, coupled with the bleak strategic prospects, might have seemed to point to one answer: to accept that Germany now dominated Europe and make the best possible peace with Hitler's regime.
It is on this point that the second, more controversial historical question has centered. Some British revisionist scholars such as John Charmley, a historian at the University of East Anglia, dismiss Churchill for not seeking a settlement, which they assert could have safeguarded the empire and kept Britain from becoming what they see as a vassal of the United States.
The revisionists argue that in 1940 Churchill had no strategy for winning the war. More important, they maintain that by fighting on to 1945, Churchill assured the liquidation of the empire and guaranteed that the only victors would be the Soviet Union and the United States.
Even scholars who find these arguments flawed acknowledge that Churchill's best reason for fighting on was one of which he had no knowledge at the time: that as early as July 1940 Hitler was contemplating turning against the Soviet Union. Of Hitler's intentions, no prediction can be found in British intelligence reports and strategic assessments. And so the revisionists dismiss Churchill's so-called strategy in 1940 as simply to keep plodding on, as Churchill acknowledged.
But to historians like David Reynolds of Cambridge University, the revisionists' belief that Britain could have maintained any kind of working settlement with a dominant Germany is ridiculous. With Germany in possession of bases along the northern and western coasts of France, the British were acutely vulnerable to blockade and hence would have been largely dependent on the sufferance of Berlin.
Ultimately Churchill's strategy, by design or luck, worked. As they argue, it was hardly unreasonable of Churchill to hope that during the chaotic diplomatic and military environment that prevailed in the absence of an agreement, the United States and the Soviet Union might well be dragged into the conflict against Hitler. After all, those nations' long-term interests clashed with Germany's to a far greater extent than Britain's did.
In the end, the revisionists' position that Churchill sacrificed Britain's empire and independence by choosing to fight on is true but beside the point, they argue. No matter what course Churchill followed in 1940, Britain's ability to maintain its position as a world power was over.
While historians may argue over Churchill's culpability for the loss of that status, it was a development over which Churchill himself despaired. This is why, as an old man, he spoke of Britain's experience during the two world wars, and lamented: "We answered all the tests. But it was useless."

HEADLINE: The Work Ahead in Bosnia

BYLINE: By Lord Robertson; Lord Robertson of Port Ellen is secretary general of NATO.

DATELINE: BRUSSELS

 BODY:
Nearly five years ago to the day, fueled by public outcry over the massacre at Srebrenica, American leadership, with the determined support of its allies, brought an end to the bloodiest war in Europe since World War II. It was a remarkable achievement, and since then it has been made even more remarkable by the progress in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the wider Balkan region.
As it becomes increasingly common in the United States to assume that America's military commitment in the Balkans should be restructured and reduced, it is worth recalling the defining role that the United States and the NATO allies have played. Now is the time not to pull out, but to stay invested to reap even larger returns. 
 When the negotiators and political leaders initialed the Dayton peace agreement, nearly 200,000 people in Bosnia and Herzegovina had died in 42 months of fighting and about 2 million had been displaced from their homes. Industrial production had fallen to 5 percent of prewar levels, and 80 percent of the population was entirely dependent on outside aid.
Into this wreck of a society came the NATO-led coalition, with 60,000 troops (one-third American) and an American general in charge. The warring factions were heavily armed, bitter from brutality and battlefield losses and accustomed to breaking any agreement they signed. The success of the NATO-led force rested on NATO's power and determination. Only tough combat forces could carry out this kind of peacekeeping. In line with the tight deadlines set in the Dayton agreement, the force first separated the warring factions, then moved them and disarmed them.
Today, the environment could not be more different. Elections are held regularly, with no expectation of violence. The 60,000 troops that once made up the peacekeeping force have been reduced to about 20,000, including roughly 4,000 Americans. With recent changes in Belgrade and Zagreb, there is more hope than ever that the politics of division will give way to the politics of reconciliation. The defeat of Slobodan Milosevic removes the biggest barrier to the Balkan region's becoming part of the new Europe.
The peacekeepers' basic role has not changed. Preventing the factions from fighting takes real soldiers, with the credibility necessary to avoid having to fire shots. Peacekeeping is largely about deterrence. But the force is also supporting civil administrators trying to rebuild, helping to foster cooperation between military forces of formerly warring factions and arresting those indicted for war crimes -- nine since I became secretary general a year ago.
What would happen if the NATO force left now? Unfortunately, violence would still be likely. Five years has not been long enough to heal the wounds from Bosnia's past. But this does not mean peacekeeping has failed; having laid the foundations, the NATO-led force, with the international community, should now see the recovery of Bosnia through to conclusion.
For anyone who needs to know how much has been achieved in the five years since the Dayton agreement was signed, a visit to Sarajevo would answer many questions. In 1995, the city had become a symbol of siege and suffering, with images beamed worldwide of a populace under constant threat and historic architecture destroyed or battered by gunfire. Today Sarajevo bustles. Its old market is again filled with shops and cafes, and the once empty road that was sniper alley hums with traffic. We must not forget how far we have come.
Hundreds of thousands of refugees have returned to Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the flow is increasing. Yet thousands more still cannot go home. The town of Brcko, once a symbol of violence and hatred, now has a multiethnic administration. Elsewhere, especially in urban areas like Sarajevo, multiethnic parties are beginning to show real strength. But in other regions extreme nationalist parties hang on. Local leaders must also realize they cannot rely forever on international economic aid. They must work to tackle the corruption and bureaucracy that are deterring the investment needed for economic growth and a truly independent nation.
But a job half done should not be given up. When historians look back, they will point to Dayton, and particularly the decisive role played by the United States and NATO, as the beginning of the events that have led to renewed hope for the entire region.

Stocks Rally, But Outlook Is Still Cloudy

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Stocks rallied yesterday in a holiday-shortened session, with the Nasdaq composite index jumping 5.4 percent while the Dow Jones industrial average climbed just 0.7 percent. But while investors appeared to jump in to pick up bargains -- especially in the technology sector -- after sharp selling recently, the concerns that have been prompting investors to sell are still there.
The biggest worry for investors is the outlook for the technology sector, which is threatening to lead the stock market's major indexes toward their worst year in decades. Signs that the economy may be slowing more than had been expected and the financial strains reflected in the bond market are also a concern. Oil prices are still quite high. And the continuing battle over the outcome of the presidential election in Florida is not helping. 
 One recent signal of investor concern comes in the flows of money in and out of domestic stock mutual funds. According to AMG Data Services, which tracks these flows, investors took $8.5 billion out of domestic stock funds in the week that ended Tuesday. That is the largest weekly net outflow since December 1999. The flows into money market funds, a traditional haven for worried investors, have been more dramatic. More than $41 billion has moved into these funds in the first three weeks of November.
These numbers, said Thomas McManus, equity strategist at Banc of America Securities, "are a sign that some investors are throwing in the towel; there is some fear."
At the end of the day, the Nasdaq composite index was up 149.04 points, to 2,904.38. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 19.41 points, or 1.5 percent, to 1,341.77 and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 70.91 points, to 10,470.23. Trading volume was below average, at 404.8 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.
In the bond market, the yield on the Treasury's 10-year note was unchanged at 5.62 percent with the price, also unchanged, at 10031/32 . The yield on the Treasury's two-year note rose to 5.85 percent, from 5.83 percent Wednesday.
Yesterday the market was led higher by Intel, up $2.75, to 43.94; Cisco Systems, up $2.13, to $52.69; Qualcomm, up $5.56, to $84.50; and Oracle, up $1.81, to $24.13. Also rallying were Hewlett-Packard, up $1.88, to $35.56, and I.B.M., up $1.31, to $99.75.
Some fuel for the rally came from stocks outside the technology sector, which also have been hit particularly hard recently, including financial stocks. J. P. Morgan, which is being acquired by Chase Manhattan, had fallen 17 percent since Nov. 6. It rose $4.19 day, or 3 percent, to $142.19 yesterday.
Stocks in the negative column yesterday included some that had been doing well recently as the major stock indexes tumbled. Procter & Gamble, which had climbed 11 percent since Nov. 2, fell $1.81, to $73.63, while drug stocks, including Merck and Johnson & Johnson also fell. Merck ended at $89.44, down $1.25, while Johnson & Johnson dropped $1.44, to $95.06.
Since the beginning of October, the Wall Street consensus forecast for fourth-quarter earnings growth in the technology sector has fallen to 16 percent from 29 percent, according to First Call/Thomson Financial, which collects earnings forecasts from Wall Street analysts.
For the first quarter of next year, the forecast for earnings growth has fallen to 17 percent from 28 percent and for all of 2001, the growth forecast is down to 18 percent from 24 percent.
And Chuck Hill, the director of research at First Call, said all the bad news was not in the revised earnings numbers yet. "There is going to be more downside before they start going the other way," he said of the earnings forecasts.
Mr. Hill also said that earnings estimates for other sectors will have to come down to fit with the slowing growth of the economy. For example, forecasts for consumer cyclical stocks have already dropped from 10 percent earnings growth to 1 percent for the fourth quarter and from 13 percent to 5 percent for growth in the first quarter of next year. "And in this kind of environment you are not going to be showing accelerating growth," he said.

HEADLINE: Roger D. Malkin, 69, Leader in Agriculture

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON

 BODY:
Roger David Malkin, a leader in the American seed industry and high-technology agriculture, died on Wednesday at his home in Scott, Miss. He was 69.
The cause was pancreatic cancer, his family said. 
 Last month, because of his illness, Mr. Malkin took emeritus status as chairman of the Delta and Pine Land Company, a top-ranking developer, grower and distributor of soybean and cotton seeds.
He led a team of investors that acquired the company, then one of several seed producers in the United States cotton market, in 1978 from a British textile group, Courtaulds Ltd.
As its chief executive and chairman, he focused on developing better seed varieties and built the company into the foremost cotton breeder in the world, with commercial activities in the domestic market and 18 foreign countries.
To do this he melded traditional methods to improve traits and up-to-date biotechnology, producing hardier varieties, enhanced fiber quality and easier harvesting.
Ray A. Goldberg, professor emeritus of agriculture at the Harvard Business School, said that Mr. Malkin was one of the first to put the "genomic revolution" to work for the benefit of the farmer and the environment. He cited "natural pesticide control" as a major advance that was helped along by Mr. Malkin's acumen.
"These technologies ushered in an entirely new system of agricultural production," Professor Goldberg added. "In countries like Brazil and China the technology saved the cotton crop."
A native New Yorker, Mr. Malkin made the Mississippi Delta his home and used various charitable outlets to benefit the area, especially in education. He set up a scholarship fund that sends qualified young men and women to attend his alma mater, Dartmouth College.
He also supported the Delta State University Foundation and the Mississippi State University Agribusiness Institute, among others.
Roger Malkin was born in Brooklyn and graduated from Dartmouth in 1952 and from its graduate business school the following year.
He had an early career in real estate and in the late 1960's acquired the Federal Compress and Warehouse Company, based in Memphis. The company operated warehouses in the South and Southwest, and Mr. Malkin restructured it to provide commercial space in an increasingly nonagricultural economy.
Another venture, in the 1980's, was the Superior Farming Company of Bakersfield, Calif., which he purchased from the Mobil Oil Company, a 38,000-acre grower of patented varieties of stone fruit and seedless grapes.
Mr. Malkin is survived by a daughter, Melissa Malkin, of Encino, Calif.; a son, Jonathan R., of Washington, Conn.; a brother, Peter L., of Manhattan; two granddaughters; and his companion, Barbara Jakobson, also of Manhattan. His marriage to Carmel Adler Malkin, a Manhattan resident, ended in divorce.

U.S. and I.M.F. Welcome Salvador's Adoption of Dollar

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN

 BODY:
El Salvador's decision to adopt the United States dollar as its currency won immediate support from the United States Treasury Department and the International Monetary Fund yesterday, reflecting a growing trend in Latin America to embrace the dollar as official tender.
President Francisco Flores said on Wednesday that he would introduce a law that would fix the colon, the local currency, to the dollar and allow free circulation of the dollar in the economy. The move, if approved by the nation's Congress, is intended to end the sharp swings in the value of the local currency against the dollar, which are viewed as discouraging foreign investment and complicating management of the economy. 
 Officials said the colon would also remain legal tender.
Earlier this year, Ecuador scrapped its local currency, the sucre, for the dollar. Panama uses the dollar as official tender, and Argentina has pegged the value of its peso to the dollar, one for one.
There is a continuing debate in other Latin American economies, most notably Mexico, about whether to allow the American currency to replace local money.
Some economists say such moves enhance financial stability and may help attract foreign business because investors are reassured of getting their money out without suffering a foreign exchange loss.
Critics say that so-called dollarization makes little sense because it turns over an important tool used in macro-economic management to the Federal Reserve of the United States. The Fed uses its control of interest rates to stimulate or cool the American economy, but does not directly consider the needs of other nations that use the dollar.
International financial authorities have generally remained neutral about the advisability of small nations' adopting a larger nation's currency as their own. But both the Treasury Department and the I.M.F. welcomed El Salvador's decision.
"Combined with a strong economic policy framework, this step should help contribute to financial stability and economic growth in El Salvador and its further integration into the global economy," Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers said in a statement.
El Salvador, a nation of five million people, has not grown as fast as many of its neighbors in recent years. Its economy expanded at a 2.5 percent pace in 1999, about one-third of the rate of growth in neighboring Costa Rica and Nicaragua.
Horst Kohler, managing director of the I.M.F., said dollarization could help stoke economic growth, though he also urged the nation to improve its banking system and enact some proposed budgetary changes to accompany the monetary change. Mr. Kohler said the I.M.F. would consider making a loan to El Salvador to back the transition to the dollar.

HEADLINE: Talks Go Down to the Wire On a Global Warming Pact

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN

DATELINE: THE HAGUE, Nov. 24

 BODY:
Negotiators met behind guarded doors late tonight, trying to reach a consensus on a global warming treaty before their meeting breaks up on Saturday.
"For the environment, it doesn't get any bigger than this," said Jennifer Morgan, the climate change specialist for the World Wildlife Fund, as she caught delegates on the way into the negotiating room for a last bit of arm twisting. 
 On Thursday, Jan Pronk, the overseer of the two-week meeting and the Dutch environment minister, had lowered expectations a notch, saying there would doubtless be issues that would be delayed and text that would remain unwritten. The next meetings are already scheduled, for May in Germany and for October in Morocco.
But he and many participants said there was a decent chance that a general declaration of success was within reach by Saturday morning.
The proposed treaty, the Kyoto Protocol, was drafted by more than 170 countries in 1997 and the session here was intended to flesh out the fine print. If enacted, the treaty would commit three dozen industrial countries to cut their greenhouse-gas emissions by 2012 at least 5 percent below the levels in 1990. So far, no industrial countries have ratified the pact.
An accord, according to many delegates and scientists gathered here, could be a first tentative step away from an age built on combustion of fossil fuels, which has flooded the atmosphere with heat-trapping greenhouse gases, and toward economies that are more in balance with global ecology.
Any success at all would inevitably be a result of big compromises on dozens of fronts, given the competing and contradictory situations of many countries taking part in the discussions.
Cloistered in the Van Gogh Hall at the Netherlands Congress Center were representatives of tiny lowlying countries vulnerable to the rising seas expected in a warmer world; of some nations where crops might flourish in a warmer world and others whose crops could wilt; of countries cloaked in forests that can absorb carbon dioxide and help them cut emissions; and of nations whose fortunes derive from coal or oil, fuels that would lose favor and cost more should the treaty take force.
As a result of this diversity, private environmental groups saw two possible outcomes. One would be a landmark success, in the form of effective, enforceable rules for cutting emissions of warming greenhouse gases. The other would be a wrenching failure, should the treaty lack clear language calling for strategies that cut emissions without creating other ecological trouble.
Today, countries and alliances that had been giving daily news conferences canceled all such sessions, with the action moving into cubicles and offices. No one seemed satisfied with the latest treaty summary. Frank E. Loy, the chief American negotiator, communicated only with a printed statement, in which he said he was "deeply disappointed" with the document, but added that "the situation is fluid" and that negotiations would press ahead.
And within the environmental movement, there were passionate divisions. Some people said the treaty, as proposed, failed to give credit for preserving tropical forests as a "sink" for carbon dioxide. Others objected to that idea, saying any credit for forest projects would take away the incentive for cutting the emissions causing the problem.
Ms. Morgan said success would lie in the strength of the consensus and its power to motivate action now to start curtailing the human impact on the atmosphere. "What we're looking for is a signal to businesses and countries that they need to start changing," Ms. Morgan said.
In the end, the prospect of a climate treaty was creating unlikely alliances, with some businesses that had long been seen as enemies of the environment aligning themselves with conservation groups. Among those at the sessions calling for clear rules and strong penalties was Dale E. Heydlauff, senior vice president for environmental affairs of American Electric Power, a $12 billion-a-year energy company that has for decades wrestled with environmentalists over clean-air laws.
"Environmental groups and industry both need strong, effective compliance mechanisms because otherwise this treaty is a fraud," he said.
Tooker Gomberg, an environmental campaigner from Ontario, blasted a shrill note on a pocket trumpet in the press room, resulting in a stampede of television crews and reporters.
He took out his passport and a cigarette lighter. "Tonight I am ashamed to be Canadian," Mr. Gomberg said. "My country is the worst country here at The Hague."
With a flick of his thumb, the passport blossomed into flames. "Some people think this conference is an exercise in politics, diplomacy and compromise," he said. "The only thing being compromised here is the integrity of the biosphere."
Eventually the halls grew quiet as aides and advisers retreated to hotels. They were useless until dawn, because their bosses were locked away with Mr. Pronk. One young man played a harmonica in a corner.

HEADLINE: Expansion Continues in Asia, but I.M.F. Warns of Slowdown

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Nov. 24

 BODY:
For most of the year, Asia's economies have performed a sort of levitating act, growing by double-digit rates month after month even as economists predicted that they would fall to earth.
That dichotomy was on vivid display here today. Hong Kong reported that its economic output grew 10.4 percent in the third quarter, and it raised its projection for full-year growth to 10 percent from 8.5 percent. 
 Yet a block away, the International Monetary Fund warned in a news conference that Asian economies could be hit hard by soaring oil prices and turmoil in the financial markets. The fund said a $5 increase in the price of a barrel of oil could slow economic growth in Asian countries next year.
"The prospects for growth in 2001 have weakened," said David Robinson, assistant director for research at the monetary fund.
"There has also been increased political instability" not just in Asia but around the world, Mr. Robinson said today.
Several Asian countries -- notably the Philippines, Taiwan and Indonesia -- have been gripped by political tumult. President Joseph Estrada of the Philippines was impeached last week, while Chen Shui-bian, the president of Taiwan, is fighting off a recall vote.
Even in more stable countries, like Malaysia and South Korea, Mr. Robinson said the fund was concerned about the haphazard pace of economic change. In many countries, the banks and corporations remain financially shaky. And in Korea, he said, the heavily indebted conglomerates are still a problem.
But Mr. Robinson acknowledged that the weaknesses have not yet affected economic performances of the countries. On Tuesday, South Korea reported a 9.2 percent increase in its third-quarter output -- beating the estimates of most analysts.
Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore have also beaten expectations, while Hong Kong's growth rate was nearly three percentage points above the median forecast of 12 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.
Like other Asian economies, Hong Kong has been buoyed by an unquenchable appetite for its exports, principally in the United States. Exports surged 17.7 percent in the third quarter. Hong Kong has done a particularly booming business in repackaging and shipping goods from China.
Consumer spending in Hong Kong rose by a much less impressive 5.6 percent, as retail sales slackened from the second quarter. Consumer prices fell 2 percent.
Ian K. Perkin, chief economist at the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce, said the double-digit growth in Hong Kong and other Asian countries masked their underlying condition. While export growth has been torrid, domestic demand has remained tenuous.
"We haven't built up our domestic economies yet," Mr. Perkin said. "The recovery has relied almost completely on export growth.
"If consumer spending slows down in the states, it will have a devastating effect on Asia," Mr. Perkin said. "2001 could be a crunch year."
Mr. Robinson of the monetary fund was also wary about next year.
In October, the fund projected that the world economy would grow 4.2 percent in 2001, while Asia as a region would grow 6.6 percent. Today, Mr. Robinson said the growth rate could be lower though he would not say by how much.
A main culprit, he said, is the dependence of many Asian countries on imported oil. Oil prices have risen $5 a barrel since the fund issued its twice-yearly economic outlook in October.
Asia has little control over oil, but Mr. Robinson said the region could improve its economic prospects by reducing its political turmoil.
"It is important that the political uncertainties be resolved as quickly as possible," he said.
One bright spot is China, which is on track to record 8 percent growth in 2000. Mr. Robinson said the main question facing China's leaders was whether they needed to spend billions on public projects to stimulate an economy that seemed quite stimulated on its own.
Like Mr. Perkin, Mr. Robinson said Asia's future depended in large part on the United States. But he disputed those who predicted drastically slowing growth -- the so-called hard landing -- for the American economy.
"The chances of that happening are less than 40 percent," he said, "substantially less."

HEADLINE: New President Of Mexico Names 4 More To Cabinet

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Nov. 24

 BODY:
The next president of Mexico, Vicente Fox Quesada, named new cabinet secretaries and aides today who will be responsible for the nation's social issues, particularly addressing the poverty gripping at least 40 million people.
In the second of three announcements naming members of his new cabinet, Mr. Fox, who will take office on Dec. 1, pledged to provide "every individual with equal opportunities to overcome poverty by their own initiative." Throughout and since his campaign to topple the ruling party that led Mexico for seven decades, Mr. Fox has promised to fight poverty, help rural and Indian communities and bolster the nation's education and health systems. 
 He said again today that he would "improve the life of every Mexican man and woman, of every family, and promote the intrinsic development of the communities that form this country."
Unlike most of the nominees for economic and foreign secretaries that Mr. Fox announced on Wednesday, the choices he made today for the education, labor and social development secretaries were all members of his center-right National Action Party, known as PAN.
The choice for labor secretary, Carlos Abascal Carranza, has close relations with Mexico's business community. Even so, independent union leaders are hopeful that Mr. Abascal will be able to improve wages for Mexicans, which have stagnated for 20 years.
Josefina Vazquez Mota, a PAN deputy in Congress and the second woman named to the 18-member cabinet so far, will be secretary of social development.
Although Mr. Fox initially invited members of the left-leaning Party of the Democratic Revolution to hold this post, they declined. Ms. Vazquez has pledged to combat poverty in the nation's poorest communities.
For secretary of education, Mr. Fox chose Reyes Tamez Guerra, dean of the state university of Nuevo Leon. Mr. Tamez said today that he would work to see that all Mexicans receive a high school education.
Julio Frenk Mora, a surgeon educated in the United States and a former World Health Organization official, was named health secretary.
Although the new nominees may lack political diversity, Mr. Fox will create offices to offer a measure of power to indigenous groups, disabled people and Mexicans living abroad. Gilberto Rincon Gallardo, who ran against Mr. Fox in the presidential election on the socialist ticket, will head an anti-discrimination commission that will aim to write legislation.
Xochitl Galvez, who was born in a poor Otomi Indian community in central Mexico and is now a successful high-tech entrepreneur, will head the Office on Indian Affairs. Victor Hugo Flores Higuera was named to lead the office for the disabled. And Juan Hernandez will coordinate the immigration affairs office, to deal with the demands of Mexicans living abroad, including more than 10 million in the United States.
Other nominees included a longtime PAN leader, Luis Alvarez, as Mr. Fox's point man to resolve the six-year leftist insurgency and right-wing counterinsurgency in the state of Chiapas. During the campaign, Mr. Fox said he could resolve the long-simmering confrontation in 15 minutes, but he has since acknowledged that it will take longer.
Mr. Fox is to make his final cabinet announcement on Monday, appointing justice, defense and interior ministers, and focusing on the fight against political corruption.

AT&T Shares Climb Slightly On Equipment-Buying Halt
AT&T, whose stock is down 62 percent so far this year, had a reprieve after it halted purchases of equipment that enabled its cable systems to carry local telephone service. That move sent shares of equipment suppliers sharply lower, while shares of AT&T rose 38 cents, to $19.13.
AT&T Broadband, its cable division, said the move was the result of streamlining its inventory-tracking procedures to cut equipment stockpiles. It expects to resume buying early next year. AT&T's decision comes at a time when the market for communications equipment appears to be cooling. Page C3. 

Output Surges 10% in Hong Kong
Hong Kong reported that its economic output surged 10.4 percent in the third quarter, and it raised its projection for full-year growth to 10 percent from 8.5 percent. Yet, the International Monetary Fund warned that Asian economies could be hit hard by soaring oil prices and turmoil in the financial markets. C14.
 
Amazon's Web Site Is Disrupted

Shell Bids for Australian Company
Royal Dutch/Shell offered to pay as much as $3.4 billion to gain control of Woodside Petroleum to increase its presence in the Asian-Pacific energy market. Royal Dutch/Shell, a British-Dutch energy group, offered to pay $7.70 a share for the 66 percent of Woodside it does not already own. If all the options were exercised, Shell would hold 56 percent of the combined company. C2.
 
More Pressure on Japanese Banks
Daiei, a struggling discount store operator in Japan, won a new lease on life from its banks. And Mitsui Construction said it would ask its banks to forgive almost $1 billion in loans. The announcements underscored the pressure on Japanese banks. Many of the banks have been reporting disappointing results for the first half of the year. C2.
 
El Salvador Dollar Plan Supported
El Salvador's decision to adopt the United States dollar as its currency won immediate support from the Treasury Department and the International Monetary Fund and reflected a growing trend in Latin America to embrace the dollar as official tender. President Francisco Flores said on Wednesday that he would introduce a new law that would fix the colon, the local currency, to the dollar and allow free circulation of the dollar. C2.
 
Software Maker Lowers Forecast
One of Britain's biggest software companies, the Sema Group, lowered its profit forecast, sending its stock into a swoon that cut its market value by 45 percent. The warning cast a further pall over Europe's information technology business. C2.
 
A Crackdown on Unruly Passengers
Swissair has decided to crack down on unruly airplane passengers by allowing crew members to tie them down to their seats with plastic cords when they endanger the flight's safety. The plan, which takes effect in January, is opposed by the crew union, which describes it as dangerous. C2.
 
Tax Evasion Uncovered in Russia
An investigation into how much tax Russian oil companies have paid on each metric ton of crude has found evidence of widespread evasion of taxes, Finance Minister Aleksei L. Kudrin said.

HEADLINE: Behind the Success Story, A Vulnerable Police Force

SERIES: THE BLUES: Leaving the Scene

BYLINE: By KEVIN FLYNN

 BODY:
Murders in New York City have been cut by nearly two-thirds since their peak in 1990, and violent crime over all has fallen to levels not seen since the 1960's. Nonviolent crimes like auto theft have also shrunk by huge margins. Thousands of people who fled what they considered a dangerous and dirty city have been replaced by families who regard the city as safe and revitalized.
Together, these crime-fighting achievements, and their role in the turnaround of the city, amount to a story of sensational success for the New York City Police Department and for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who has wasted few chances to trumpet it. 
 But quietly, inside station house locker rooms and recruiting offices, a more troubling tale of the department is also unfolding.
The number of officers leaving the force, including scores of its most senior supervisors, is surging. The difficulty in attracting men and women to join the 41,000-officer department has become acute, and the latest classes graduating from the department's training academy have shown signs of being more prone to mistakes or misconduct.
Moreover, the special tax funds and federal grants that helped underwrite a huge expansion of the force during the 1990's have dried up, or are about to, raising the specter that the cost of maintaining the largest police force in city history will become an unwieldy burden if the economy slows.
The department's personnel struggles and the looming uncertainties about its financing, then, are posing unsettling questions about the future of one of the city's essential institutions.
The simultaneous realities -- far-reaching triumphs and deepening institutional problems -- make for a remarkable civic incongruity: a police force at the top of its game and yet perhaps more vulnerable than at any time in years.
Consider, for instance, what many regard as the department's internal cracks, as disclosed in department records and interviews with police and union officials:
*More than 1,700 officers have left the department this year through retirement or resignation, a third more than last year. Of those, roughly half left before qualifying for a full pension. Further, because of a departmental demographic bubble, the overall number of officers eligible to retire will triple next year.
*Three times as many captains have left the department during the fiscal year that began in July than left during the same period last year. Over the next five years, more than half of the force's 2,100 captains and lieutenants will be eligible to retire. The departure of senior officers threatens to accelerate a recent trend in which the experience level of senior supervisors has dipped. Three years ago, more than half of the force's captains had 20 years of experience or more; today, less than a third do.
*The number of people taking the test to become police officers has fallen precipitously in recent years, to 12,000 in 2000 from 32,000 in 1996.
*The rate at which recruits have been cited for infractions during their time in the academy tripled between 1997 and 2000.
A range of forces are behind the department's current challenges. The number of officers eligible to retire is climbing. A thriving economy has made it harder to lure candidates, especially when the starting salary is less than what a police officer makes in Bridgeport, Conn. The pressure to produce ever-declining crime statistics has left some of the department's most experienced commanders weary of ever-rising expectations. The perception that many citizens, and the news media, do not appreciate them, or even scorn them, has left officers demoralized.
Indeed, the growing number of departures and the dwindling number of applicants have raised this question: Is a department that expanded to meet a growing crime problem about to backslide in both size and supervisory experience, leaving the city more vulnerable?
"In 10, maybe 5 years, the consequences of losing so many good people are going to be felt," said Eli B. Silverman, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and author of "NYPD Battles Crime," (Northeastern University Press, 1999). "The consequence is that you may become far less effective as crimefighters, and the bad guys may reassume their ascendancy."
Others are even more blunt.
"It seems the next mayor is being set up," said John Driscoll, president of the Captains Endowment Association, the union that represents captains and other supervisors. "The guy can't succeed. The problems being left behind are mind boggling. Morale is so low. People are leaving and there is no one to replace them."
Police Commissioner Bernard B. Kerik, who took over the department three months ago, has tried to address issues undermining the appeal of the job. He has said pay should be raised and ordered quick renovations to improve conditions at often decaying station houses. He has begun having dinners in his conference room with officers from various commands, prodding them to discuss their frustrations.
"Do they have issues?" Mr. Kerik said. "Yeah, they have some issues. But, you know what, they are not like major issues, and they are issues that can be addressed."
Mr. Kerik said much of the grumbling grew from the sort of cynicism that is endemic to the department, especially during contract talks, which are taking place now.
"If you look at the overall shape of the department, it is in good shape," he said. "Can it be tweaked? Yes. Could you focus in on certain things in certain areas to make it better? Yes. But that doesn't mean that it wasn't working in the first place."
 
Better Tactics, and Results
 Many analysts agree that the department is a more effective crime-fighting agency than it was when Mr. Giuliani took office in 1994.
For decades, the analysts said, the department's approach to crime had been largely reactive. Resources were focused on responding to 911 calls. Many officers viewed crime as the outcome of social forces beyond their control. Commanders were evaluated more on their arrest numbers, or effort, than the crime rate, or results. Large numbers of officers never worked weekends, when much of the crime occurred.
Mr. Giuliani's police managers are credited with changing much of that. They created a system of accountability for commanders, mapped crime trends to detect patterns and promoted people on the basis of results, not seniority. They made sure suspects were questioned in case they knew something about an unsolved crime. They changed the way officers were deployed, placing more in narcotics units that were assigned to high-crime areas.
The police concentrated on violent crimes, while refocusing attention on minor, quality-of-life offenses that had often been overlooked. Misdemeanors not only bred a sense of disorder that could invite more crime, but also were often committed by serious criminals who had otherwise escaped arrest.
Most important, perhaps, the Giuliani team re-energized the rank and file, said Thomas Reppetto, a crime analyst and co-author of "NYPD: A City and Its Police" (John Macrae/Holt, 2000).
"The cops got what they had long sought," he said. "They regained the freedom to go out and be cops, to arrest criminals instead of driving past them."
 
Another Side of Success
 The flip side of some of these strategies has been evident for some time. Residents in neighborhoods both affluent and impoverished have complained about what they interpreted as overly aggressive police work. What was quality-of-life enforcement for the police was often seen as harassment by residents, and misdemeanor arrests swamped the city's criminal courts with defendants of every race and nearly every economic class.
The shooting death of Amadou Diallo in the doorway of his Bronx home spurred outrage and a debate about whether the encounter was a result of reckless or racist patrol tactics, as some critics argued, or an isolated incident in a department that is otherwise showing greater restraint in using force. The torture of Abner Louima in a Brooklyn station house also prompted charges that the police had become an arrogant and sometimes violent presence.
Federal prosecutors in both Brooklyn and Manhattan are now weighing whether to push for the appointment of monitors to oversee some of the department's operations, including its disciplinary system.
But largely lost in the louder, more familiar disputes has been an appreciation of what is taking place inside the department itself: a damaging drop in morale, a rising tide of departures and a worsening struggle to recruit new candidates.
Opinion is divided over how closely this internal uproar is tied to Mr. Giuliani's leadership.
The $3.2 billion budget he has afforded the department is its largest ever and has clearly been vital to its impressive work. Mr. Kerik said many officers also appreciated the support Mr. Giuliani showed for officers in disputed incidents.
"When the mayor doesn't support the cops of this city," Mr. Kerik said, "you are not going to get worse morale than that."
But the contract Mr. Giuliani awarded the police several years ago was considered miserly by many officers because it contained a two-year wage freeze. They cite the low pay and pressure to produce as reasons that they have chosen to end their career, eager to work for other police departments or to be paid better for their expertise, in the private sector.
"The deal was take back the streets and I will do something for you," said one commander with more than 20 years on the force. "It was quid pro quo, and it was done, and then nothing happened and the cops got zero, zero."
The sentiments of those departing can be just as grim.
"Most of the people that were in my academy class are getting out," said Detective William O'Connor, a 19-year veteran. "The only ones who are staying are people who may have a child with an illness and they need the coverage."
 
'Nothing Was Good Enough'
Capt. John Costello, a 30-year veteran, and Officer Philip Halpin, who had just completed his third year, both left the Police Department this year. Captain Costello chose retirement. Officer Halpin took a better-paying job with the Suffolk County Police Department on Long Island.
"Whether I should stay or not was not even a thought," said Officer Halpin, who spent three years patrolling Brooklyn and quit one week after getting the Suffolk job. "I knew the N.Y.P.D. wasn't paying me what I was worth and that the working conditions and morale weren't going to get better."
Captain Costello's primary complaint was not pay, but what he viewed as the numbingly relentless demand to top his own arrest or summons numbers.
"Nothing was good enough," said Captain Costello, who had been a commander in the Vice Enforcement Division. In 1997, for example, he recalled being assigned to crack down on public drinking at the St. Patrick's Day parade. His officers were fortunate to stumble onto a large crowd of teenagers drinking in a plaza along Fifth Avenue and issued hundreds of summonses. The following year, though, the teenagers were not there.
Still, he said, he feared he would be chastised if his summons number dropped. So his plainclothes officers found themselves skulking in doorways. Any container in a paper bag was suspect, as was anyone with a plastic cup.
"You are so desperate to get these summonses, you are like sniffing their coffee," Captain Costello said.
These two former members of the force reflect the drain many fear is going on in the department.
A total of 937 members of the department have retired this year through October, compared with 736 during the same period last year. The increase stems in part from the fact that the number of officers eligible for retirement -- those who have completed 20 years of service -- rose sharply this year.
In the mid-1990's, very few officers became eligible for retirement because virtually none had been hired two decades earlier, during the city's fiscal crisis. Last year, for example, only 218 became eligible to retire. Even this year, only 411 officers who were hired in 1980 are scheduled to complete their 20th year. But next year the number jumps to 1,501. Over the next five years, a quarter of the force will become eligible to retire.
The surge in departures is not merely a matter of increased eligibility. The number of officers who have resigned this year before serving out their 20 years has also increased remarkably. Some 801 have left this year, compared with 570 during the same period last year, an increase of 46 percent.
Some left simply because they were disappointed in the job. Many took advantage of a new benefit, effective this year, that awards partial pensions to officers who leave with as few as five years on the force.
Police officials insist that, looking forward, most officers will stay, even those eligible to retire. But the signs do not look promising. A total of 1,508 officers left the department during the fiscal year that ended in June, or 47 percent more than the number police officials projected in a 1993 attrition study.
Certainly, many members of the rank and file believe an exodus is under way. In station houses, billboards are awash with retirement party notices. Officers check off the days to their departure on calendars tucked in their desks. Pension seminars are filled to overflowing.
"The only people who know how much time they have left," said one lieutenant in the Bronx, "are cops and prisoners."
 
Losing Experience at Top
 The outflow can be measured in different ways.
For instance, Officer Halpin will hardly be the only former New York City officer who becomes a Suffolk County officer when he graduates from Suffolk's academy next March. A third of the 134 recruits in that academy are converts from the New York Police Department. And the Manhattan North homicide squad, which investigates murders north of 59th Street, lost 6 of 26 detectives this year, investigators said.
"We are losing so many senior people at the same time," said Thomas McKenna, who retired in June after 35 years. "It will be difficult for the young investigators to get the sort of on-the-job training that goes beyond what you might have learned in college."
Some of the urge to leave is economic. Even those who are retiring to an easy chair, not a second career, find that with tax breaks, their pensions nearly match their working salaries. And in some cases, the department's own policies appear to have given some supervisors an added incentive to leave.
Operation Condor, for example, an enforcement initiative financed through overtime, has raised the pay of some senior lieutenants and sergeants by more than 20 percent this year, officers and union officials said. As a result, several commanders and union officials said they knew officers who suddenly decided to retire because their pension would be calculated on the basis of their higher pay this year.
There, are, too, numerous seasoned supervisors who have left because of the pressure noted by Captain Costello.
But police officials, who describe the system they have set up as a meritocracy, say they enjoy broad public support in pushing for greater declines in crime. And Mr. Kerik said he had made a point of stressing that he expects supervisors to be civil and respectful when dealing with subordinates.
But so far this year, 85 officers who held the rank of captain or above have filed for retirement, according to police union officials. During all of last year, only 61 retired.
Police officials, asked if the departures might make for a more inexperienced tier of supervisors, said they were not worried. Supervisors with less time on the job, especially younger captains who came to the department better educated than their predecessors, are not necessarily less qualified, they said. Nonetheless, an official said Mr. Kerik was reviewing proposals to create additional financial incentives for officers who agree to stay past 20 years.
 
More Pay as Hotel Guard
 Ernest Boyd was many of the things New York City looks for in a police officer. He was a mature man, 34, with a stable work record, a bachelor's degree in fine arts and a 97 average from the Police Academy. He was also a black man who would help to diversify a poorly integrated force.
But Mr. Boyd quit the force in April, after two months patrolling the streets of Brooklyn, saying he was disgusted with his salary.
To make more money, he said, he returned to his old job, as a security guard at the Marriott World Trade Center hotel, where from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. he watches the lobby, delivers packages and patrols the bathrooms. The $500 a week he takes home is more than the $411 he took home as a police officer, he said.
"I had to ask myself," he said, "do I want to hang around this neighborhood for five years and see what happens or make something of myself?"
Mr. Boyd's short tenure with the Police Department underscores the challenges it is facing in attracting and keeping new recruits.
In New York this month, only 12,000 people signed up to take the police test, despite an elaborate advertising campaign and many deadline extensions. Four years ago, the test takers numbered 32,000. And for the first time in memory, the department this fall came several hundred recruits short of filling its academy class.
The declining interest in police careers is a national problem, with many departments struggling to compete with an enticing private sector. Some, like Los Angeles, are operating several hundred officers short.
But the problem threatens to become similarly acute in New York, where $20 million in advertising over the past two years has not done much to drum up interest. For every person like Daniel Maher, 33, who gave up a teaching career last month to try police work, officials run into several candidates who will not take the job, even after they ace the entrance examination.
Eddie W. Santiago, for example, earned one of the 10 highest scores on his civil service exam in October 1999. But Mr. Santiago, 32, of Brooklyn, turned down the job. Although it paid better than his job as a typist for the United Nations, he said, "My mother was not so happy about my being a cop because it is so dangerous and they don't get respect from people."
A former chief, Aaron Rosenthal, said the mystique of the New York Police Department had faded for applicants. "At one time, when you contemplated a police job, you thought only of New York," he said. "It was like being recruited by scouts to play for the Yankees. It was more a calling than a job. Today it's strictly a job."
Many analysts said the primary obstacle to attracting more police candidates was pay. The salaries of New York officers now lag behind not only Nassau and Suffolk Counties, where a disparity with the city has long existed, but also places like Newark and Jersey City. A five-year Newark officer, for example, earns $60,000, or $20,000 more than his New York City counterpart.
"The lack of pay is pathetic," said Gerald W. Lynch, president of John Jay College, which monitors the job market for its graduates.
In the past seven years, largely owing to the pay differential, more than 400 New York officers have left for police jobs on Long Island. It has become so routine that officials in the village of Rockville Centre have been known to thank the city for training its officers.
"I say it in a positive sense," said Jack McKeon, the village police commissioner. "It's not meant to make fun of New York. It's just done to show the community what a quality product we have."
City officials say that salary comparisons alone do not measure the extent of compensation that New York officers receive through benefits like unlimited sick leave and pension supplements. One benefit, for instance, gives retired police officers a yearly bonus of $8,500 on top of their pensions.
But given the eroding interest in the job, critics have questioned whether the department will have to lower standards to gain recruits. Police officials reject that, noting that the average score on entrance exams has improved in recent years. But there are indications that some of the recruits in the last academy class of 1,321 had more difficulty in training than their predecessors.
For example, the number of disciplinary and rule infractions committed by that class, which graduated in October, was triple the number cited for the 1997 class. Similarly, 170 members of that class either dropped out or were dismissed, double the number in 1997.
 
Fears of Lower Standards
 The age and education level of lower-ranking patrol officers have risen under Mr. Giuliani, whose administration raised the entry age from 20 to 22 and required new officers to have two years of college. But several weeks ago, to help with recruiting, the city dropped the minimum age by a year and said that applicants with two years as school safety officers or traffic enforcement agents did not need college.
Mr. Kerik said neither move had lowered standards, and that the increase in disciplinary infractions did not indicate a growing problem with new recruit classes. "I haven't seen standards drop at all," he said.
The city's recent recruiting campaigns have been as expensive as any in the country. This year, recruiters used $10 million to, among other things, visit seven military bases and to run their television ad more than 2,000 times. Teams of recruiters personally visited street corners and subway stations, focusing on neighborhoods where the residents were largely black or Hispanic.
The efforts have begun to attract a more diverse group of candidates, with 19 percent of the current academy class black and 28 percent Hispanic, the most minority recruits in history.
But in an unreleased report last summer, the Board of Visitors, a study panel appointed by Howard Safir, the police commissioner at the time, found that the department needed to hire more recruiters and do more long-range planning. The report warned that if recruitment continued to slump, the department would find itself unable to keep pace with attrition. "It is estimated," the board's report concluded, "that in the next five years there will be an attrition of thousands of officers."
That prospect does not loom as a calamity to critics who think the force has grown too large. In fact, the force has grown by a third since 1990, even as the number of city employees has dropped by 4 percent.
Maintaining the force at its current level is expensive, but the city has barely felt the cost, in part because of prosperous times and in part because some costs were underwritten by federal grants and an income tax surcharge that expired in 1998. The economic climate has grown cloudier, however, and federal money that offset the cost of hiring 4,300 officers, about 11 percent of the force, began to expire last year.
This year, the city is paying $214 million to cover the cost of those officers, according to figures from the Independent Budget Office, a city agency. Next year, the cost jumps to $300 million, a figure that will rise even higher if the city gives officers a raise, as anticipated.
If the economy falters, the cost of carrying so many officers could become a burden. On the flip side, Mr. Kerik said, the appeal of a stable civil service job with good benefits would only improve in the midst of economic trouble.
"When the economy is horrible, " said Mr. Kerik, "people are jumping on these jobs."

HEADLINE: City Lines Up More Shelter For Homeless

BYLINE: By NINA BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
Anticipating an unusually cold winter, the city's Department of Homeless Services is adding hundreds of shelter beds to be available on freezing nights to homeless single adults, Martin Oesterreich, the commissioner of homeless services, said yesterday.
At the moment, the system has room to spare, Mr. Oesterreich said, but beginning Dec. 4, in anticipation of the seasonal rise in demand for shelter beds, the city is contracting with private, nonprofit agencies to add 330 beds in Brooklyn to citywide reserves. The city is also negotiating with churches and synagogues to make regularly available the 500 beds they now provide on an intermittent basis. 
 "I'd rather be safe than sorry," Mr. Oesterreich said. "City Hall's been very supportive of that."
Plans for the seasonal expansion of the shelter system contrast with last year's court battle over the city's longstanding right to shelter. A state court ruling in February stopped the Giuliani administration's efforts to bar homeless people from shelters if they failed to meet work requirements and other welfare eligibility rules. The judge's decision is expected to stand at least through the rest of the mayor's term in office, because an appeal contemplated by city officials has yet to be filed.
On Thanksgiving night, 7,059 single adults slept in the city's 7,512-bed network of homeless shelters, with 300 beds in reserve. The shelter system includes some large, city-run dormitories, but in the last five years it has been increasingly dominated by smaller, specialized programs in which nonprofit agencies offer rehabilitation, mental health services or job training along with a place to sleep.
The seasonal expansion of the shelter system is one of the most visible measures of the city's response to homelessness, but it does not necessarily mean fewer homeless people will be seen on Manhattan streets.
Some homeless people shun the shelter system except in extreme cold. Some who appear homeless actually use the streets or subways more as a place of business than as a bedroom. And others, including many of those who have lost a place to live mainly for economic reasons, like rising rents and low wages, pass entirely unnoticed by the public.
Police sweeps of homeless people from more visible places in Manhattan have tended to disperse some of those living on the street to other boroughs, advocates for the homeless say. And police crackdowns on "quality of life offenses" such as drinking in public, trespassing, obstructing the sidewalk and panhandling -- like the one recently announced by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani -- also tend to send homeless people out of sight, to the jail on Rikers Island among other places.
An analysis of the city's computerized shelter records in recent years shows that about 25,000 people use the city's single-adult shelters in a given year; about half of these leave after a week and do not come back. Another third return periodically for stays of about 80 days, while a minority are the long-termers who dominate the public image of the homeless.
A study issued this week by the Bronx borough president, Fernando Ferrer, who is running for mayor next year, estimates that the so-called street-bound homeless number more than 10,000 people citywide. The study recommended a more coordinated approach among city agencies that deal with the homeless, including the police.
In another pending lawsuit with a potential impact on the homeless shelter system, a state judge ruled last summer that continuing mental health care must be arranged for mentally ill inmates before they are released from Rikers Island and other jails. That order has been stayed pending a city appeal, but a settlement is under negotiation. Lawyers for the plaintiffs said it could include referring such inmates to specialized shelters, instead of dropping them in Queens Plaza at night, as is done now.
Advocates had mixed feelings on the city's addition of temporary beds.
"It's certainly a welcome change to have the focus be getting a roof over people's heads, but it's unfortunate that the city continues to view single-adult homelessness as something that can be dealt with mainly with emergency shelter beds instead of permanent housing and additional mental health services," said Steven Banks, the Legal Aid Society lawyer who represents the Coalition for the Homeless. "The bottom line is, a shelter is not a home."
In the family shelter system, Mr. Banks added, 9,850 children in 5,483 families are now in emergency shelters, and though peak demand typically comes in the summer months when children are out of school, in recent weeks as many as 30 families were left to sleep on the floors and benches of the Emergency Assistance Unit in the Bronx.
Mr. Oesterreich said the new beds for men would be run by the Father Young Residence, near the city-run Bedford-Atlantic men's shelter, and those for women by Interfaith Medical Center, both in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn.
At a time when many cities are facing rising numbers of homeless people in the streets, Mr. Oesterreich said, New York City's shelter system is now seen as an international model, citing social services officials from Canada and Germany among recent visitors.
About 80 percent of all city shelter beds are run by nonprofit social-service agencies that try to wrestle with some of the causes of homelessness, like mental illness, unemployment and drug addiction.
"Unless you address those underlying conditions," Mr. Oesterreich said, "you're not going to make a dent."

HEADLINE: Either Online Or in Line, Time to Shop;
Amid Mixed Forecasts, Strong Sales for a Day

BYLINE: By LESLIE KAUFMAN

 BODY:
The sun was not yet up in Albuquerque on the day after Thanksgiving, but already at least 300 people were lined up waiting for the doors of Toys 'R' Us to open at 6 a.m. They had come to grab morning-only deals like scooters (this year's must-have item) for $27.99, Furbys (last year's hot item) for $5 with any purchase, and whatever else they could stuff in their shopping carts.
Theresa Avila, a 40-year-old mother of a 9-year-old daughter, said she was excited about getting her shopping done early and buying as much as possible. 
 "The basic economy seems pretty good, and you don't hear a lot about people getting laid off, so it makes for a more festive attitude about shopping," she said with a grin in the chilly temperatures. "We don't know who our next president is, so we just buy. We'll worry about that after Christmas when they're done counting."
Christmas 2000, like Election 2000, is shaping up as a nail-biter, and all eyes are on the Theresa Avilas of the world to see if they will deliver roaring growth as they did last year, or play Grinch and send the consumer economy into a tailspin.
The economy remains fundamentally strong, unemployment is still at record lows and consumer confidence, while not as giddy as last year, is still at high levels. Inflation remains in check. But there is considerable uncertainty in the market. Americans have lost more than $1 trillion in paper wealth on stocks since spring, and gas prices and interest rates have risen. Then there is the unsettled presidential election, which is threatening to rattle consumers just as the holiday season begins.
Predictions for holiday shopping have been all over the map. At Merrill Lynch, Daniel Barry, the chief retail economist, is forecasting sales growth of only 2.5 percent, the worst since at least 1990. That pessimistic outlook is directly at odds with bubbly consumer surveys published by the National Retail Federation and American Express. The federation estimates that consumer spending on general merchandise, apparel and home furnishings will rise a strong 5.5 percent to 6.5 percent in November and December, and the American Express Retail Index is showing an expected increase of 8 percent.
The day after Thanksgiving, known as Black Friday because merchants historically have relied on sales leading up to Christmas to move them from the red into the black, is traditionally a day that industry experts use to gauge the health of the holiday shopping season. Although it is hard to tell whether big crowds mean big sales -- Americans tend to pack into their malls whether they are shopping or merely gawking -- early reports from the nation's merchants, many of whom entered the season with trepidation, were very optimistic.
"Last year, the day after Thanksgiving was our biggest volume day ever," said Mary Conway, president for retail sales at Sears, Roebuck & Company, who was at the chain's outlet in Wayne, N. J. "And this year we have started off at a better pace than that." Ms. Conway said consumers were buying sale items like half-price cordless drills as well as more expensive merchandise like fine jewelry and special-occasion wear.
In fact, if early indications are correct, most shoppers turned their backs on CNN and the Florida recount, and did what they have always done: shopped early and often. At a Target store in Houston, eager toy seekers lined up before 6:30 a.m. despite unusually cool weather. Some, like Kim Smith, 34, an insurance worker had actually been up since 4:15 to be there when KayBee Toys opened its doors at 5 a.m. "My family thinks I am crazy," she said, but "I get the last laugh because I get the hot items before they're all gone."
At 7:10, Mary Bentley, 37, a comptroller, another early-morning Target shopper, was already headed for the car with a Fisher-Price Cook 'n Clean Kitchen. "They had what I needed and I was in and out," she boasted. Still, she had not found that one precious item: a scooter.
There were sporadic reports from malls in different cities suggesting stunning increases in traffic. Gurney Mills Mall in Gurney, Ill., a value outlet center, said foot traffic was up 45 percent by 11 a.m. compared with the same time on the day last year. At the Taubman Center's Columbus City mall, in Columbus, Ohio, parking requests were up 40 percent by 10 a.m. over the last year's figure.
Yet despite the strong start, stock analysts and economists remained wary. "Black Friday was strong last year, and then there was a lull," in consumer shopping, said Jeff Feiner, a retail analyst with Lehman Brothers, who is sticking with his forecast of moderate 3 percent to 5 percent growth. "It is fine out there, but it is not going to be a barn burner."
Mr. Feiner and other analysts remain concerned about a lack of hot apparel merchandise, a problem that caused early-fall sales to sag at many of the major chains, including Gap Inc. and Kmart. Another worry is the highly competitive environment, which has caused many stores to cut prices sharply and early, possibly endangering profits.
For lucky consumers, the sales started well before the holiday. Pre-Thanksgiving discounts had the mobs thronging Macy's flagship store at Herald Square the day before Thanksgiving. In the fifth floor shoe department, where knee-high black leather zip-up boots were going for a little more than $100, customers ambushed sales associates as soon as they came out of the back room -- but even then there was not enough sales help.
In Manhattan, stores from the Henri Bendel boutique to Bloomingdale's to the Swedish discount sensation H & M were festooned with banners proclaiming 30 percent off and more. Buyers who shopped before 11 a.m. were frequently rewarded with bigger discounts or freebies. Disney Stores, for example, were handing out 102 Dalmatian Beanie Babies to the first customers through the doors yesterday morning.
Part of the reason for steep price cuts so early is that few retailers have come up with a winning fashion formula. One exception, Express, a division of Limited, enticed women with a glittery disco look this fall. Even with temperatures hovering near freezing on the East Coast, Express was scoring with skimpy, spangled halter tops in silver and come-hither pink. It seemed that almost everyone else was competing to sell familiar-looking leather coats and chunky knit sweaters.
Whatever their struggles with cut-rate prices and tepid styles, though, many traditional brick-and-mortar merchants were taking consolation from the substantially weakened e-commerce competition. Web sales are actually expected to take a bigger piece of the total retail pie this holiday season, but because of a string of bankruptcies among high-profile dot-coms, the Internet is not the psychological threat that it was last year.
Jupiter Media Metrix, an Internet research company, is predicting that online sales for this November and December will be roughly $11.6 billion, up 66 percent from last year. That is a robust gain, but it hardly matches the nearly threefold sales increase from the previous year. And a disproportionate amount of the sales increases are expected to go to the on-line arms of established retailers like J. C. Penney and Sears.
The future might consist of a lot of shoppers like Robin Wedenoja. Outside the new four-floor Gap store on Michigan Avenue in Chicago, Ms. Wedenoja passed out light blue, sea foam green, pink, and baby blue gloves, hats and scarves she had just bought to her three girls, Leigh, Britt and Reagan. That purchase, she said, was the exception, not the rule. "Today is mainly just a day to look around and get ideas," said the Grosse Pointe, Mich., woman. "My online buying has increased in the last year. It's just so easy." But that should not make the enormous chain sweat. Her favorite online stores are Lands' End and the Gap.
Nevertheless, Yahoo, the largest of the Internet portals, said orders on its shopping service were running more than double last year's levels. "Even with the negative publicity surrounding e-tailing as a channel," said Richard Rogowski, a senior producer at Yahoo shopping, "it continues to remain a strong option in consumer's minds."
The priority for online retailers this season is avoiding the failures in customer service, order delivery and site malfunctions that plagued the Web last year. But just a few hours into the holiday shopping season, Amazon.com, the behemoth of virtual stores, was forced to close its United States Web site for 30 minutes. Bill Curry, a company spokesman, said the halt in operations was "due to an internal glitch and nothing to do with high volume of holiday calls." Amazon, he said, expects to experience no further problems.

 On Hallowed Ground
 Abraham Lincoln and the Foundations
 of American History.
 By John Patrick Diggins.
 330 pp. New Haven:
 Yale University Press. $27.95. 
 A fter World War II, a group of historians, led by Louis Hartz and Richard Hofstadter, argued that by virtue of the absence of a feudal past, America had been spared the extremes of European conservatism or socialism. Instead, they argued, American politics had enjoyed what Hartz called a Lockean liberal consensus about the role of government, the market and the individual. John Patrick Diggins wants to revive this school of thought to combat the idea -- which he claims to be popular among contemporary historians -- that America has been simply a convergence of different native and settler cultures, characterized by conflict rather than consensus. In his new book, Diggins, who teaches history at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, argues that Lincoln, in his interpretation of the Declaration of Independence, spelled out this American consensus: "America's foundations lie in the egalitarian ideas that Lincoln expounded to the world. . . . When Lincoln invoked the Declaration as the 'moral emblem' of the Republic, he saw the document as embodying the country's exceptional social conditions from which it in turn derived its unique cultural preconditions, particularly the idea of equality and the natural right to work freely and rise socially."
Diggins's attempt to resurrect the consensus school is a worthy project, but there are problems with the way he goes about it. One is purely procedural. In "On Hallowed Ground," we read that "ironically, the more attractive America becomes in the eyes of the world's oppressed people, the more repellent it becomes in the writings and teachings of intellectuals who like to put 'free' in quotation marks and refer to their country as fascist 'Amerika.' "If we look at the footnotes to find these writers we discover a work by someone who shares Diggins's criticisms of them. Readers not familiar with such academic quarrels will find argumentation like this frustrating, even if they share Diggins's horror at people who spell America with a "k."
The other kinds of problems are substantive. One has to do with how Diggins defines the American consensus. A case can certainly be made -- and Hartz did it in "The Liberal Tradition in America" -- that a Lockean belief in "atomistic social freedom" runs deep in American political thought and has limited the possibilities of reform, reaction and revolution. You can also argue that the abstract commitment to equality evinced in the Declaration was reaffirmed and made more specific by the outcome of the Civil War and the post-Civil War constitutional amendments. But Diggins wants to argue that Lincoln's very special understanding of 19thcentury capitalism was embodied in the Declaration and remains today a core American conviction. Diggins fails to make this case, and contradicts himself in the course of trying.
According to Diggins, Lincoln reads into the statement that all men are created equal Locke's view that it is a natural right for a man to own as property the products of his labor. But Lincoln also believed in a socially mobile single-proprietor capitalism: "I want everyman to have a chance -- and I believe the black man is entitled to it -- when he may look forward and hope to be a hired laborer this year and the next, work for himself afterwards, and finally to hire men to work for him. That is the true system." Diggins says this "natural right to work freely and rise socially" was integral to Lincoln's view of the Declaration and puts this belief in the "true system" at the center of the American consensus.
It certainly was at the center of Northern belief just before and after the Civil War. The economy was based on small farms and shops, and a white man in the North or West could realistically aspire to owning his own business. But was this belief central to the ideas of the Revolutionary generation? Diggins acknowledges that Thomas Jefferson, the author of the Declaration, referred to the protection of "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness" and not to the protection of "life, liberty and property," but, he asserts, "the Declaration itself is Lockean through and through, and Jefferson sought to prettify its meaning by substituting the 'pursuit of happiness' for what would have been a crass reference to property." This is, to say the least, a controversial assertion for which Diggins does not provide any evidence.
At other places, however, Diggins suggests that Lincoln was reinterpreting the Declaration in the way that some modern Supreme Court justices have reinterpreted the Constitution. Diggins writes that in "reading into the Declaration the primacy of labor," Lincoln gave the Declaration "a conscience, a moral quality lacking in Jefferson's notion of happiness." And he admits that "the foundations I write about . . . are not the political foundations founded by our founders."
Diggins could still argue that Lincoln succeeded in describing what the average 18th-century American believed, but I don't think he wants to try to make this difficult case. The fact is that if you acknowledge that Lincoln's full-blown philosophy of labor was not part of the Declaration's underlying philosophy, then you must admit that it is not the American consensus but rather Lincoln's own redefinition for his time of what the Declaration said about equality.
As for the present, Diggins insists that Lincoln's true system continues to be at the center of American conviction and dismisses arguments by radical historians to the contrary. But they are right, and he is wrong. By the late 19th century, American capitalism had changed fundamentally. The system of small-scale proprietorships was replaced by a system based on corporate capitalism, and the desire to rise came to mean rising within the diverse wage-laborer classes. The dream of the true system lingered on -- many Americans still aspire to own their own businesses -- but it has had to share billing with other dreams of self-fulfillment and freedom.
If Diggins wants to defend the consensus historians, he will have to make a more finely tuned argument. America has a common culture, but it does not follow from certain unchallengeable axioms. Just as Lincoln reshaped Jefferson's ideas to the purposes of his time, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Martin Luther King reshaped Lincoln's. Diggins's exposition of Lincoln is interesting, but it does not sustain a theory of American history or provide a sufficient platform from which to refute competing contemporary theories. And I write this as someone who shares Diggins's discomfort with many of these theories.

 BODY:

 Midnight Diaries
 By Boris Yeltsin.
 Translated by Catherine A. Fitzpatrick.
 Illustrated. 398 pp. New York:
 PublicAffairs. $26. 
 By the last days of the last millennium, there was very little left that Boris Yeltsin could do to astonish the people of Russia. He had embraced more than a half-dozen prime ministers and scores of senior aides during his decade of power -- only to toss them one by one from the Kremlin bell tower. In 1991, when he stood on the top of a tank to stare down a coup, his impulsiveness was heroic. Two years later, when he shelled a mutinous parliament into submission, it still seemed understandable.
Things got more complicated after that: Yeltsin waged a long war in Chechnya that brought honor to no one and death to tens of thousands. His health was so bad, and he was absent at so many critical moments -- including at the height of his 1996 presidential campaign against his Communist challenger, Gennady Zyuganov -- that his aides were caught doctoring an old video to present to the press as new.
By the end of his tenure, Yeltsin's speeches, once stirring, no longer meant a thing. He frequently confused major countries and in one much-noticed address he referred to Japan as a nuclear power. When he warned Bill Clinton, in 1998, that American aggression against Iraq could start a world war, State Department officials actually laughed at a comment that once would have frozen them, and half the world, in fear.
Yet, last December, addled by illness, deeply unpopular and six months short of retirement, Yeltsin had one big card left, and, as he writes in "Midnight Diaries," the third volume of his autobiography, he was determined to play it. He called his chief of staff and informed him that his annual New Year's speech to the nation, which had already been taped, would have to be shot again on Dec. 31. He didn't tell anyone, not even his wife. Yeltsin's resignation came as a genuine shock, and he says in this book that he did it because "the new century must begin with a new political era."
An honorable gesture and possibly even a true statement. Yeltsin also writes, however, that "it was important not to have any slip-ups or leaks." And he leaves no doubt about what would have happened if his surprise had been ruined. "If the news got out there wouldn't be a resignation," Yeltsin writes. If he couldn't go out his way, the new era would simply have to wait.
That is about as candid as Yeltsin gets in "Midnight Diaries," which focuses most specifically on the last few years of his presidency. The earlier volumes, not unlike the young Yeltsin, were vigorous, salty and forthcoming. This one is none of that. Rather, it is a flat and ultimately sad book, written by a man who played an essential, if contradictory, role in the history of the last century.
Yeltsin has always been maddeningly hard to cram into a box: a despot, a drunk, a megalomaniac. Yes. A liberator, a reformer and a visionary. That too. There were astonishing acts of bravery, but also of alcohol-induced buffoonery (such as the ceremony to mark the Russian military withdrawal from Berlin in 1994, when he grabbed a baton and conducted the band).
In this book, Yeltsin says accusations about his drinking were overblown, but he acknowledges that alcohol was "the only means" at his disposal to get rid of stress quickly. "I remember that the weight would lift after a few shot glasses. And in that state of lightness I felt as if I could conduct an orchestra."
Still, Yeltsin cannot be dismissed. He is the only Russian leader to run for re-election (an election his most conservative advisers urged him to cancel). We take it for granted, but we shouldn't, that Yeltsin retired without a gun in sight. He never turned his back on the free press, and while scholars will debate for decades over his stewardship of the ruinous post-Soviet economy, he believed in market capitalism, and in a freely convertible currency. That's more than we can say for the guys who came before him. A few rich people benefited obscenely; but so did tens of thousands of hard-working young Russians.
Overcoming Communism, peaceful relations with the West, freedom of worship and movement -- Yeltsin's legacy should be assured. It is not, however, because what the president stitched together one day he ripped to shreds the next. He might have used this memoir to make a reasoned case for some of his more controversial actions. But there is no reason in "Midnight Diaries." Time and again, Yeltsin shows how his pettiness got the best of him. He has at least a few bad words for nearly every servant who ever toiled in his government. Anatoly B. Chubais, the man most Russians associated with the most painful economic reforms, was controversial in everything he did and too brash in much of it; but he was searingly loyal to his chief. The boss decided "he was using the new rules of the game as a political club," though, and fired him. (Actually, he fired him twice.)
When it was convenient -- and it usually was -- Yeltsin relied heavily on the murky and problematic banker-industrialist Boris A. Berezovsky. He was one of the president's most powerful allies. Until, that is, he wasn't. "I never liked Boris Berezovsky, and I still don't like him," Yeltsin writes of his longtime associate today. "I don't like him because of his arrogant tone, his scandalous reputation and because people believe that he has special influence on the Kremlin." Those are reasonable objections. One wonders, though, why Yeltsin kept appointing him to the most senior posts in Russia while permitting him to retain control of a giant empire of companies that included the nation's biggest television station and Aeroflot, its national airline.
Yeltsin spent much of his time in office, and spends most of the pages of this book, playing with his power. "Midnight Diaries" reads like a sort of Russian retelling of "The Princess and the Pea." It is a book about a good czar named Boris and his desperate attempt to find somebody who could qualify to carry his heavy mantle into the future.
As Yeltsin's longest-serving prime minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin was the president's most reliable ally. "All these years he had stood behind me as an exceptionally decent, conscientious and devoted person," Yeltsin writes. Still, he had to go. "Probably at some earlier point, I had not given him the opportunity to blossom as an independent politician. But it was too late to regret it now." Yeltsin is far more vicious about Aleksandr I. Lebed, the blustery general who negotiated the end of the first Chechen war and who helped ensure Yeltsin's re-election by joining forces with him in the 1996 runoff against Zyuganov -- a fact Yeltsin never mentions. Lebed was simply "like a little kid, he would stop at nothing," Yeltsin says. It is true that Lebed was an immature politician. But it also can be argued that he saved Yeltsin's presidency. About Lebed's critical role in ending the carnage in Chechnya, Yeltsin has nothing to say. But that isn't surprising because he had nothing to say at the time either.
It's fair to argue that the Chechen leaders never truly wanted peace; they certainly didn't know what to do with it when they got it. But Yeltsin's justification of the war is disingenuous. He refers to two years of official savagery as "military struggles against terrorists, not a war against a people." He presents his version of the domino theory -- that if Chechnya went, then the Caucasus would go and then on to Siberia and before you know it Russia would be Yugoslavia.
To describe other world leaders, Yeltsin simply assembles cliches. After he resigned, he invited the heads of most of the former Soviet states to his home for a meal of Siberian dumplings. He describes Islam Karimov, the president of the repressive government of Uzbekistan, as "a subtle man in the Oriental tradition." The president of Kazakhstan, Nursultan A. Nazarbayev, was also there. He said nothing, though, because he possessed "a modern sensibility with an Oriental caution." Emomali Rakhmonov, the leader of Tajikistan, was seated not far away. And, Yeltsin tells us, despite the violence that governs the country Rakhmonov manages to maintain "his Oriental charm."
In the end, only Vladimir V. Putin had the will and the resolve Yeltsin sought in a successor. Putin's victory in March was due largely to support for the newest war in Chechnya and the people's desire to see order restored to their government. A former K.G.B. colonel, Putin certainly is orderly. His first year has been consumed with more war on the Chechens, flagrant attacks on the news media and the relentless pursuit of his enemies. For many Russians, Putin has already accomplished the impossible: he has made them miss Boris Yeltsin.

HEADLINE: INTERVIEW;
His Liberal Imagination

BYLINE: By Alexander Star; Alexander Star is the editor of Lingua Franca.

 BODY:
At the age of 83, Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. is still hard at work. In the coming years, he plans to complete both the second volume of his memoirs and the fourth volume of his series on the age of Franklin D. Roosevelt. When asked to name his biggest regret, he said, "I should have written more books."
Q. Your memoir devotes a considerable amount of attention to the years 1940 and 1941, and to the quarrel over whether the United States ought to intervene in Europe against Hitler. 
 A. Yes, I think the isolationist-interventionist debate of 1940-41 was the most savage in my lifetime. More savage than the McCarthy debate or the Communist Party debate or the Vietnam debate. It really tore friends apart, and families apart. On the whole, liberals were interventionists, but many of them were isolationists. And conservatives were equally divided.
Q. During the war, you took a job with the Office of War Information in Washington. Did you have any qualms about leaving behind your work as a historian of the Jacksonian era?
A. No, no, not at all. I've always had an active temperament. I have what Justice Holmes called the desire to share the passion and action of your time. That's why I wanted so much to get a look and see. If you weren't killed or maimed in the Second World War, I think it was in certain respects an exhilarating experience. But I've also suggested that this wasn't "the greatest generation." The greatest generation is the generation that declared independence and formulated the Constitution.
Q. Your book emphasizes how much shabby behavior there was on the home front; you refer to a "miasma of chiseling" in the world of business.
A. World War II was a good war in the sense that it was a war that was worth fighting. But it was not characterized, particularly at home, by selfless sacrifice. There were a lot of people who were trying to make as much money out of the war as they could. They wanted to maneuver into postwar advantage.
Q. In the early 60's, you worked in the White House with John F. Kennedy. In many respects, Bill Clinton appears to have modeled himself after President Kennedy. How would you compare them?
A. He's reminiscent of Kennedy, certainly, in his high swift intelligence, his impressive technical command of all the issues, his genuine intellectual curiosity. But he's not a fighter. He lacks self-discipline. He is sometimes too clever by half, and he dislikes making enemies. F.D.R. said, "Judge me by the enemies I have." Bill Clinton, for all his intellectual and magnetic qualities, hates making enemies.
Q. Why was this year's presidential election so close?
A. Neither candidate was very compelling. And the Democrats were the victim of their own success. When you have a contented country, and a widespread belief that the economic machine will run on its own fire, then the likability of candidates becomes a factor. Whereas, if the country is threatened by great problems, likability is not a major matter.
Q. When you consider the next volume of your memoirs, what do you think some of the highlights will be? You've already written about your years in the Kennedy White House.
A. Yes, I don't want to repeat myself. But the 1950's are very interesting because you had the Korean War, you had Joe McCarthy, and you had the rise of John F. Kennedy. I enjoy politics; I enjoy being on the margin of politics. But I see myself, essentially, as a historian. Malcolm Muggeridge titled his memoirs "Chronicles of Wasted Time." And I feel that I should have spent much more time writing history and less time writing op-ed pieces or speeches for candidates.
Q. In the late 40's, you spent some time working as a political journalist, producing ambitious pieces for Fortune, Life and other publications. What do you make of political journalism today?
A. I think there are good journalists around. But it may be that the figures in politics aren't as arresting. My generation was formed by Roosevelt, as well as Truman, Eisenhower and Kennedy. And think of kids today, who remember only Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush. They have a different sense of politics.
Q. Are there reforms that would bring more arresting people back into national politics?
A. Anything that would diminish the role that private money plays in politics. We are the only country to regard the greatest decision a free people can make -- that is, who should govern them? -- as an occasion for private enrichment. TV stations don't own the airwaves. They get them on license from the federal government. And a condition of that license should be, in my view, the provision of free prime time to political parties during elections.
Q. In the 50's, you worked with Adlai Stevenson on his presidential campaigns. Do you think that if Stevenson had won, he would have championed the kind of aggressive liberal agenda you called for in your 1949 book, "The Vital Center"?
A. No, I think Stevenson was much more conservative in the 50's than he became in the 60's.
In fact, there is an argument that the great mistake was Truman's re-election. Walter Lippmann claimed that had Thomas Dewey defeated Truman in 1948, there'd have been no Joe McCarthy.
Q. Why?
A. In the 1948 Republican primary, Dewey and Harold Stassen had a debate in Oregon about outlawing the Communist Party. Stassen favored outlawing the Communist Party; Dewey opposed it. Dewey wasn't a bad fellow. He was rather enlightened. James Polk once said of an opposition congressman who came to call that, although a Whig, he seemed a gentleman. And in that sense, although a Republican, Dewey was not a reactionary. And had he won, the politics of revenge which played a large role in the McCarthy years might have subsided.
Q. Throughout your memoir, you speak of how friendship can cross ideological lines.
A. Friendship is a mysterious thing, but it does bridge over quite fundamental disagreements. I thought Bill Casey was a disaster as head of the C.I.A., but nonetheless we remained personal friends. Eric Hobsbawm, the British Marxist historian, remains a very dear friend. I've always gotten along well with Pat Buchanan. He knows a lot about American history. He draws the wrong conclusions from it, but he's an agreeable fellow. I liked Robert Taft. Bill Buckley and I are friends again.
Q. You're well known for wearing a bow tie. These days, the bow tie seems mostly absent from the necks of liberals. Do you feel rueful about that?
A. I hadn't noticed. My generation, people like Jimmy Wechsler, who was the liberal editor of The New York Post, we all wore bow ties. But I'll take note of that. What about Louis Farrakhan? Doesn't he wear a bow tie? Well, that's no argument for it.

HEADLINE: Food;
Caviar Lite

BYLINE: By Molly O'Neill

 BODY:
Jim Kahrs is working his 9-iron on the golf course he built around seven of the ponds that dot Old Sage Catfisheries, his fish farm in the Missouri Ozarks. He pauses, hits his approach shot to the second green, then climbs back into his motorized golf cart. His ponds are thick with catfish, bass, blue gill and also paddlefish, which, after three decades, are finally producing palatable roe. You could almost call it caviar. Putt. Putt. Putt.
For nearly half a century, Kahrs has waged a one-man war against marine depletion by breeding and then shipping young freshwater fish to restock waterways around the world. Sturgeon, specifically the two dozen varieties that yield caviar, the world's most luxurious food, is his final frontier. And he has taken a unique approach, breeding an alternative in the hope of relieving the pressure on the wild stock of what he calls "the poor ole sturgeon." 
 Kahrs is 74, and he is a happy man. Let the purists denounce his American Paddlefish Caviar. Yes, that's what he is calling the roe that is now finally coming to market. He can't imagine anything that tastes better than saving a species. And his stuff is the best in its class. It is distributed by Petrossian. Putt. Putt.
The paddlefish roe is right on time. This year's wild caviar harvest from the Caspian Sea, where 70 percent of the world's supply of luxury caviar resides, is the lowest it has been in a century. In addition, strict enforcement of international treaties designed to protect the sturgeon is eradicating black-market caviar, limiting imports to precious little.
But our appetite for the briny fish eggs hasn't diminished. In fact, luxury threatened, in food as in all things, is usually luxury squared. Historically, however, caviar was not a badge of connoisseurship or a totem of conspicuous consumption or even what we automatically ate on festive occasions. When American rivers like the Hudson, the St. Lawrence and Kennebec were mottled with sturgeon, caviar, pressed and dried in the Native American fashion, was merely plebeian protein. Back then, heaping bowls of the salty fish eggs were the peanut-and-pretzel freebies of 18th- and 19th-century saloons.
Caviar got sexy when caviar got rare. It got classy when the supply of domestic sturgeon was depleted in the 1890's. Imported from the Caspian Sea in Russia and Iran in the 50's, caviar got expensive. And the little egg's mystique began to climb.
Now, with wild sturgeon stores all but endangered, caviar has never been so expensive, so prized or so fetishized. Each glistening globe -- a dance of darkness and light, a tiny capsule whose pop releases an ocean -- could be the last. At least, the last of caviar as we've known it.
Unlike that of diamonds made precious by an economic cartel that limits their flow, caviar's rarity is not artificial. It is nature's revenge. Overfishing, environmental disruption and pollution have decimated the dinosaurian sturgeon that lay the gold-priced eggs. Experts say that regenerating the Caspian could take decades. But appetites won't wait. So caviar itself is changing. Fish farms are beginning to breed it. Mon Dieu!
Kahrs, for one, has bred an alternative species, the home-grown paddlefish -- a cartilaginous fish similar to sturgeon. Thriving in freshwater ponds where it feeds primarily on plankton, the farmed paddlefish bears roe that is free from the muddy overtones plaguing paddlefish roe taken in the wild. Old Sage Catfisheries' American Paddlefish Caviar has a small, nearly black bead that is firm and rich.
The roe resembles sevruga caviar but lacks its finesse. No hints of herbs, fruit or nuts dance beneath its surface. But used as an ingredient -- heaped, along with cr<heart>me frache, on baked potatoes or blini, or oozing from an omelet or crepe -- the paddlefish eggs lend a tangy mystique to a dish.
Paddlefish roe cannot, however, be confused with the luxury variety, although this caviar communicates the intention of luxury and evokes the memory of it. And at half the price of imported sevruga, paddlefish roe can also be used with abandon. Opulence helps distract from what the fish eggs lack.
"Darn tootin'," Kahrs might say, although connoisseurs, of course, would never confuse lavishness with luxury. Still, as caviar changes, connoisseurs face a problem of another kind: the traditional standards of appraisal no longer work.
Most luxury caviar, for instance, tends to look like tiny, luminous South Sea pearls and can be neatly divided into three primary grades: beluga, the gold standard, is a tender egg, ranging from pale pearl gray to deep steel color with a buttery rich, oceanic taste. Osetra produces a smaller, firmer, snappier caviar that has a rich, nutty flavor and ranges in color from gold to dark brown. Sevruga is a tiny black egg that is intensely briny.
Farm-raised caviar -- most of which is quite different from Kahrs's paddlefish roe -- is developing categories of its own. For instance, Sterling caviar -- the brand name given to the superb eggs of white sturgeon from the Stolt Sea Farm in Elverta, Calif., near Sacramento -- is now being sold in four grades. There are Sterling Classic, Premium, Royal Black and the top of the line, Imperial, with prices ranging from $30 to $60 per ounce. Comparable in quality to osetra, the Sterling caviar that is sold is similar in size to beluga. Its color can vary widely. "We go from jet black to blond," says Chuck Edwards, the marketing manager of Stolt, who acknowledges the decades of science and millions of dollars invested in farming sturgeon and recreating her precious roe.
Stolt's Sterling caviar comes from the same fish as luxe caviar: the white surgeon. On the farm, it is fed scientifically calibrated fish meal and raised in freshwater tanks above ground, where natural conditions prevail, right down to a current that simulates an upstream swim. The female is between 8 and 10 years old and from 80 to 150 pounds (compared with 500 in the wild) when the roe is harvested.
To savor its rich, nutty taste and firm aggressive crunch requires a certain willingness to suspend the traditional equation between appearance and taste. But the effort is rewarded: Sterling caviar is delicious. "Isn't it?" I ask Kahrs, who refuses to consider himself a rival of Stolt, choosing instead to applaud all efforts at preservation.
"Well, the truth is, I wouldn't know," says the man who dreams of seas once again darkened by lumbering sturgeon. He'll pay dearly for good golf clubs, a well-knit sweater and fine food. But some costs leave a bad taste in his mouth. "I've spent my whole life saving fish," he says.I have, well, you could say, a little hang-up about eating caviar."
 
Scrambled Eggs With Caviar
 
 4 extra-large eggs
 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
 1 shallot, finely chopped
 2 tablespoons heavy cream
 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
 A few grinds white pepper
 1 3/4 ounces (50 grams) caviar
 Bread or sliced brioche, toasted and buttered for serving.
1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees. One at a time, hold each egg, rounded end nestled in the palm of your hand, and gently saw it with a serrated knife about 1/2 inch down from its pointed end to remove the tops of the eggs. (Work over the sink to catch any drips.) Dump the raw eggs into a bowl, remove any pieces of shell and set aside.
2. Discard the shell tops and rinse the shells under running water. Place them upside down on paper towels to drip. Carefully transfer to a cookie sheet, then place in the oven and bake for 3 minutes to sterilize. Set aside to cool.
3. When ready to serve, heat the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat and add the shallot. Cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Then whisk together the reserved eggs, the cream, salt and white pepper and add the mixture to the pan. Cook, whisking or stirring frequently, until the eggs are just done but not solid. Place the eggshells in egg cups and carefully fill them with the scrambled eggs. Top each serving with a few teaspoons of caviar and then serve immediately with toast or brioche.
Yield: 4 servings.
 
New Potatoes With Caviar and Creme Fraiche
 
 8very small round new potatoes (about 1/2 pound total), unpeeled but well scrubbed
 1/2 tablespoon canola or vegetable oil
 Kosher salt or sea salt to taste
 1/3 cup creme fraiche or sour cream
 1 3/4 ounces (50 grams) caviar of choice
 1 tablespoon thinly sliced chives.
1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Slice each potato in half and take a thin sliver off the bottom of each half so that the potatoes stand upright. Using a melon baller, carefully hollow out the center of each potato half, creating small bowls with sides about 1/4 inch thick.
2. Lightly brush the potatoes all over with oil and sprinkle generously with salt. Place them on a small greased baking sheet. Bake in the middle of the oven until just tender when pierced with the tip of a paring knife, but still holding their shape, about 12 minutes. Remove and set aside to cool.
3. When ready to serve, fill each potato half with 1 teaspoon of creme fraiche and then top with about 1/2 teaspoon caviar. Sprinkle with chives and serve.
Yield: 16 hors d'oeuvres.
 
Oysters on the Half Shell With Champagne Sauce and Osetra Caviar
 
 1 cup Champagne
 1 shallot, finely chopped
 1 sprig fresh tarragon or 1/4 teaspoon dried
 1 teaspoon Champagne or white-wine vinegar
 5 tablespoons chilled unsalted butter, diced
 16 oysters on the half shell
 1 3/4 ounces (50 grams) osetra or other caviar.
1. In a small saucepan, combine the Champagne, shallot, tarragon, and vinegar and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer, uncovered, until the liquid has evaporated to about 2 tablespoons, 7 to 8 minutes.
2. If you are using fresh tarragon, remove and discard the sprig. Reduce burner heat to its lowest and whisk in the butter one piece at a time. Remove from the heat. Fill a bowl big enough to hold the bottom of the saucepan with hot water, then set the saucepan in the water to keep warm. (Refresh the hot water if you plan to hold the sauce for long.)
3. When ready to serve, arrange the oysters on a serving platter. Top each with about 1/2 teaspoon of the warm sauce and 1/2 teaspoon of the caviar. Serve immediately.
Yield: 16 hors d'oeuvres.

Open Courts for All

BYLINE: By Randy Cohen

 BODY:
My friend and I play tennis in a neighboring town where only residents who pay a yearly fee of $50 may use the courts. The courts are unsupervised, and one or both of them are always vacant. We are not preventing any resident from playing. Are we committing an unethical act by using the courts? -- Shane Mullane, Westchester County, N.Y.
I'm afraid you are acting badly. This is a version of what economists call the "free rider" problem: is stealing cable really theft? You cost the cable company nothing and prevent no one else from using cable. Yet if everyone were to steal cable, the company would go under -- no more cable TV, no more "Sex in the City" (which many economists would consider lamentable, although I don't see why). Hence your obligation to pay your share for any such service. 
 However, while you behave badly, that neighboring town behaves worse by giving you no way to pay your share even if you wish to. The town does have a legitimate interest in financing its facilities and regulating their use, but this can be done without pulling up the drawbridge.
Residents-only policies, redolent of gated communities, are disturbingly undemocratic and too often have the effect, if not the provable intent, of excluding minorities and the poor. Happily, in most American towns, public facilities like museums and ball fields, libraries and playgrounds, are open to all. You don't have to show your papers to enter Central Park in Manhattan, even if you hail from Westchester.
My husband and I will soon put our house on the market. It is a beautiful house in a great neighborhood, but the builder cut some corners on the construction. After the closing, when my disclosure can't affect the sale, should I tell all? My husband says to let the buyer's engineer determine what needs to be done, but I'm afraid he'll miss some things. What do you think? -T.C., Long Island, N.Y.
I'm with your husband. There is a built-in conflict of interest between seller and buyer: the former wants to get the highest price; the latter wants the lowest. The solution is for both parties to adhere to the standards of behavior that customarily govern such transactions. That means you must honestly answer any question put to you, and you may not conceal any flaws, but the buyer should not rely on you to volunteer every defect in the house. It is the buyer's responsibility to have a good engineer check out the place. In short: caveat emptor.
The more important consideration is what you do before the sale, not after. But if you spring a list of shortcomings on the buyers two minutes after the closing, they may not be as grateful as you anticipate. Even though unspoken, the word "sucker" might echo through the inadequately insulated bathroom beneath the leaky roof.
At a fast-food restaurant, I parked next to a well-worn car that sported a bumper sticker with some pretty foul language. Although the words on display are used commonly -- I have used them myself -- I was offended, and if I had had a can of spray paint, I would have been tempted to paint over them. Would that have been wrong? - G. Kaye Holden, Roseville, Calif.
The idea of free speech is to increase, not decrease, conversation. A better response would be to leave a note telling the driver what you think of his bumper sticker. He gets his say, and you get yours. Nobody's bumper gets painted, and nobody's nose gets punched by someone angry that his bumper got painted.

HEADLINE: The Way We Live Now: 11-26-00;
Two Nations, Undivided

BYLINE: By Andrew Sullivan; Andrew Sullivan, a contributing writer for the magazine, writes daily commentary at www.andrewsullivan.com.

 BODY:
If you take a look at that remarkable postelection map, in which all of George W. Bush's states are red, and all of Al Gore's states are blue, you would be forgiven for thinking that we live in essentially two nations. A friend recalled the map of pre-independence India: a vast, red Hindu subcontinent adorned with a Muslim necklace in the regions that would shortly become Pakistan and Bangladesh. Look at postelection America, and you see a similarly clear geographic divide: the liberal, urban coasts with a couple of Midwestern blobs nervously framing a homogeneous, conservative heartland. As the political analyst Michael Barone first noticed, cities with more than half a million people went to Gore by a 3-to-1 margin, but in small towns, Bush won about 60 percent of the vote.
The columnist Mike Barnicle described this divide as "Wal-Mart versus Martha Stewart" or "Family values versus a sense of entitlement." The Democratic pol-turned-pundit Paul Begala had an even starker explanation: "You see the state where James Byrd was lynch-dragged behind a pickup truck until his body came apart -- it's red. You see the state where right-wing extremists blew up a federal office building and murdered scores of federal employees -- it's red." The divide can be described in a million ways: ethnic minorities versus white traditionalists; rootless cosmopolitans versus redneck bigots; Salon.com versus the Drudge Report; iMac users versus tow-truck drivers; Starbucks versus Cracker Barrel; NPR versus Rush. And the close nature of the race, and the deeply different personalities of the two candidates, only accentuate this picture. 
 But if you break the map down into counties, you see something more interesting. What's that blue sliver meandering up the Mississippi? Look at the bluish enclaves in New Mexico, Wisconsin, Louisiana and Tennessee. Check out the red inland counties of California. Democrats won more than half of Texas' Congressional seats. More than four million Californians voted for George W. Bush. In Bush's highest margin of victory in any state, in Wyoming, Al Gore still got well over a quarter of the vote. In Gore's biggest statewide blowout, Rhode Island, Bush still won about a third of the vote.
We live in a prosperously complex time, and the election proved it. The professional political classes' careers were at stake, but many others saw it as a bitter fight over not very much. Two candidates spoke to a real divide; they discussed America's role in the world and the corruption of the political system. And between them, Ralph Nader and Patrick Buchanan could barely scrape up 4 percent of the national vote. The distinctions between the major candidates were, on a cosmic level, trivial. Both proposed to pay down the national debt; both offered tax cuts; both offered some form of prescription-drug entitlement under Medicare; both were internationalists; both were scions of political dynasties. Only the emphases were different.
To add to this, many supported their candidates with severe reservations. Plenty of liberal Democrats would rather listen to a modem than to Al Gore, and plenty of conservatives think W. mangled their arguments. Fundamentalist Christians, blacks and Jews voted as blocks, but they are the exceptions. A third of Latinos voted for Bush; Catholics and Asian-Americans were roughly split. A full quarter of even the gay vote went to Bush -- even more to Republican Congressional candidates.
And then when you look at individual voters, the complexities only mount. I think of my own cultural mishmash: immigrant, gay, urban, observant Catholic, culturally liberal, white Bush-backer in the District of Columbia. I can't be the only one having difficulties fitting into this two-nation business. Look at the first two commentators I mentioned. Mike Barnicle looks as if he belongs in the reddest of states. But he's from Massachusetts, where Al Gore won one of his biggest victories. Or think of Paul Begala, eager spinmeister for the blues. Where is he from? Sugar Land, Tex., home of Tom DeLay, Republican hatchet man. I see Begala sometimes at Mass. He doesn't look like a countercultural subversive to me. In fact, there are many urban elites who have one foot in the heartland. Think of George Stephanopoulos: liberal macher, son of a Greek Orthodox priest. Or take a glance at all the Republican staff members on Capitol Hill: young, urban, "South Park" watchers. Or look at Al Gore: a man born into privilege who married his high-school sweetheart and served in Vietnam. Or W. himself: a man of the heartland who just happened to go to Yale and Harvard. They're each as complex as the other.
It's easier, of course, to put them into neat, little boxes: red and blue, right and left, heartland and coasts. But if this election showed anything, it is that the political need for this simplicity is almost proportional to its disappearance in our lives. We will survive this close vote, and multiculturalism in its deepest sense will be the ultimate victor. To borrow Nathan Glazer's phrase, we are all multiculturalists now -- and this hybrid identity doesn't just separate us from one another, but equally separates us from ourselves. We can either bemoan this complexity or celebrate it. I'd rather celebrate and marvel at the way our old political system has now absorbed the new cultural kaleidoscope of all our lives.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
Stretching For Safety Aloft

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE

 BODY:
MEDICAL studies have produced conflicting conclusions on whether there is a link between travel, particularly in an airplane, and venous thrombosis, or blood clots in veins. But following the death of Emma Christoffersen, a 28-year-old who collapsed at Heathrow upon debarking from a 20-hour Qantas flight from Australia and died of thrombosis on her way to the hospital, the nuances of the dispute were lost.
Deep-vein thrombosis can be fatal when a large blood clot in the leg breaks off and migrates to the heart and lungs, as it did in Ms. Christoffersen's case; this sort of threat required President Nixon to keep his leg elevated on air trips in 1974. Vice President Dan Quayle was hospitalized in 1994 for clots his doctor ascribed to sitting too long on planes. 
 Despite researchers' recent conflict over the relationship between air travel and thrombosis, medical experts in the field of travel are clear about who is at risk -- those with a history of clots, women taking birth-control pills, and people with cancer or who have had recent surgery. And experts are likewise clear about safeguards for health in flight.
 
Debate Over Aspirin
These specialists describe as unwise the advice of a British organization, the Aviation Health Institute of Oxford. After Ms. Christoffersen's death, it said air travelers should take aspirin before a long flight as a blood thinner. There are no clinical data on the value of this step absent personal medical advice, said Rebecca Wolfe-Acosta, executive director of the Traveler's Medical Service in New York; many people have medical reasons not to take aspirin.
Dr. Nigel Dowdall, senior consultant to British Airways Health Service, who is based in London, deplored the Aviation Health Institute's comments. "Despite their name, they are not a medical research institute," he said.
After Ms. Christoffersen died Sept. 28, many news reports spoke of "economy class syndrome," a phrase used in 1988 in the British medical journal The Lancet. Most experts believe that if blood clots are linked to air travel, they are linked to other forms of travel with cramped, passive conditions -- buses, cars or trains -- and can occur in first class, too.
The 1988 Lancet article was written by Dr. John M. Cruickshank and two associates; Dr. Cruickshank had suffered an embolism after a trip to the Far East, and nearly killed himself by playing tennis after he thought the problem had passed. The authors studied data maintained at Heathrow on 61 sudden deaths of long-distance passengers over three years. Eighteen percent were ascribed to blood clots; the victims tended to be women over 40 with a history of thrombosis in deep veins.
A more recent study was made by four physicians at the Pasteur Hospital in Nice, France. From July 1992 to August 1995 they examined 160 patients, 51.8 percent men, who came to their hospital in succession with thromboembolic disease, as well as 160 in an age-matched control group with other complaints. The physicians, led by Dr. Emile Ferrari, presented their results in Chest, a publication of the American College of Chest Physicians, last year.
This study found a history of recent travel -- not necessarily by air -- was four times more frequent among the thrombosis patients than among the others. All trips of more than four hours in the four weeks before hospital admission were considered: 2 train trips, 9 plane trips and 28 car trips. The risk of thrombosis is not restricted to air transport alone, the paper said: "We show that all means of transport can be 'incriminated.' "
A study finding the opposite was published in The Lancet on Oct. 28. Six researchers at the University of Amsterdam said earlier reports were based on uncontrolled or poorly controlled studies. From April 1997 to January 1999, they studied 788 patients, 58 percent women, who also arrived consecutively at the hospital. The patients were asked if they had made air, bus, car, train or boat trips of more than three hours in the previous four weeks. These questions were answered before diagnostic tests, which were then conducted without knowledge of patients' travel history. Blood clots in veins were confirmed in 186; the 602 others formed the control group.
"Our findings suggest that, for all types of transport examined, there was no association between travel and an increased risk of thrombosis," wrote the authors, led by Dr. Roderick A. Kraaijenhagen.
Dr. Karl Neumann of Queens, the Web editor for the International Society of Travel Medicine, who writes about and counsels patients on health in flight, said the Dutch study represented good news for travelers but should be treated with caution. He strongly urged that passengers who fall into the high-risk category consult doctors about measures to take before air travel.
The cause of thrombosis is pooling of blood in the legs, which is caused by prolonged inactivity and sitting, usually with the backs of the knees against the seat, with a contributing factor the lessened proportion of oxygen in cabin air and thus in hemoglobin.
The study in Chest magazine called dry air a possible contributing factor, and one of Dr. Cruickshank's co-authors, Dr. Richard Gorlin, said that the oxygen-poor environment could mildly affect an average person, but for those with marginal circulation problems, it could cause trouble.
Dr. Neumann said there was no value in drinking a lot of water because it did not increase the oxygen supply and dehydration was not a real threat aboard planes; it is air-conditioning that makes the skin and mouth feel dry, not approaching dehydration.
 
Comfortable Clothes
Passengers concerned about blood clots should dress in comfortable, loose clothes for travel in cars or planes, and should not wear knee socks with elastic tops or other garments likely to constrict blood flow from the legs, Ms. Wolfe-Acosta said. People whose veins do not function well, she said, should see a doctor ahead of time and get fitted for elastic stockings that keep the blood from pooling. "Don't just put on an Ace bandage," she said. "Stay well hydrated, and that will at least force you to get up to go to the loo."
Many airlines encourage passengers to exercise their feet and legs to improve circulation and prevent problems, an activity that Dr. Neumann and Ms. Wolfe-Acosta also urge. Lufthansa has long had a 10-minute video, "Flyrobics," showing exercises to be performed while seat belts are fastened. Dr. Dowdall of British Airways said that his airline was seeking better ways to give information on exercise, perhaps a video. "We want people to get those calf muscles going," he said, but not necessarily in the aisles.
The in-flight magazine for Qantas, The Australian Way, recommends on its safety-information page that passengers move their legs three or four minutes an hour to improve circulation. Steve Kernaghan, a Qantas spokesman in Los Angeles, said that the airline planned to dedicate two audio channels to exercise information.

Ghosts of Portugal in Macao, Now Part of China

BYLINE: By DAISANN McLANE

 BODY:
HAVE you ever been to Macao?" I asked everyone I met in Hong Kong. The answer, nearly always, was yes. Hong Kong residents pop off to Macao for the weekend as casually as New Yorkers head for the Hudson Valley or the Hamptons. It's an easy trip that requires little advance planning. Regular ferries between the two cities, both former colonial outposts, both now Special Administrative Regions of China, zip passengers to and fro across the South China Sea in about an hour.
Since Macao is so accessible, I expected it to be a smaller version of Hong Kong, with a few Portuguese style buildings (Macao was a colony of Portugal until 1999) and a lot of casinos (gambling is legal there). But history and economics can isolate a place as effectively as mountain barriers or xenophobic leaders. Compared with Hong Kong, which tears down and rebuilds itself with abandon, Macao exists in a freeze frame. 
 During the three days and nights I spent there in October, I often felt as if I were walking around in a historical preserve, not a city. Or in an Indiana Jones movie (one of which, I learned later, was filmed partly in Macao).
I decided to toss my map and let my feet lead me through the sepia-toned side streets off San Ma Lo, Macao's main thoroughfare. Passing a row of apothecary shops, their shelves stacked with jars of dried medicinal herbs, I paused to peer through a window at three large jars in which pale serpents floated, coiled, in formaldehyde. On the corner a vendor ladled a bitter-smelling brown tonic into glasses for his customers, old men in white sleeveless undershirts who downed the brew in two gulps. Another vendor spread his wares on the sidewalk: yellowed 1940's advertising posters for Hong Kong perfume companies and brightly colored printed labels carefully peeled off boxes of firecrackers and slipped between cellophane for safekeeping.
There were antique shops at every turn. I entered one carefully, through an obstacle course of porcelain urns and Confucius statues, and stopped to admire a display case filled with dozens of tiny thin-soled silk slippers, all encrusted with sequins. I had never seen Chinese children wearing such treasures, and I suddenly realized that these elaborate slippers had been worn not by children but by women with bound feet.
Macao, not Hong Kong, was the first colonial outpost of the Pearl River delta. The Portuguese settled on the peninsula in 1557, worked out a lease with the local Cantonese authorities, and proceeded to carve for themselves a profitable role that served them well for 100 years or so, as trade intermediaries between a closed China and a spice- and silk-craving Europe. Macao thrived as a halfway house between East and West, a city of Taoist temples and baroque Catholic churches. But its golden years faded along with Portugal's declining fortunes as a colonial power. By the 1700's the Dutch had moved into the East, and the English followed. When the British took possession of Hong Kong in 1841, Macao was already a backwater.
But a savvy Portuguese governor in the 1850's legalized gambling in Macao, a move that has shaped the economy, and the image, of Macao to the present day. Gambling gave Macao an air of raffishness, and a reputation, often deserved, as a refuge for shady characters and deals of every stripe.
After the handover of Hong Kong to China in 1997, several of Hong Kong's notorious gangs, or triads, relocated to Macao. The warfare spilled into the streets, and at one point got so outrageous that the most notorious triad leader, Wan Kuok-koi, nicknamed Broken Tooth, financed a movie in which one of Hong Kong's most handsome actors played him, as a hero. Meanwhile, the State Department issued a traveler's warning about Macao, and tourism plummeted.
Compared with the hubbub surrounding the Hong Kong handover in 1997, Macao's handover from Portugal to China in 1999 passed with relatively little fanfare. But in the 11 months since Macao became a Special Administrative Region of China, the triads have disappeared into the woodwork, and the tourists have slowly started coming back.
Arranging a trip to Macao from Hong Kong -- at steep discount rates -- was so easy that I feared there was a catch somewhere. To book my hotel and my ferry tickets, I went to the Shun Tak Center, a shopping mall on Hong Kong island that connects with the Hong Kong-Macao ferry terminal. Just outside the ferry entrance was a cluster of travel agencies, with window advertisements for hotels. The text in almost all the posters was Chinese, but one agency, Macao South China Travel, had some English print in the window, too, so I went in to inquire.
I told the desk clerk that I wanted to arrange a short stay in Macao, and she gave me a listing of 28 Macao hotels, with the daily rates for the next week in Hong Kong dollars. With a few quick calculations, I realized that the midweek prices on this sheet were 40 to 50 percent less than the rack rates in my guidebooks (weekend prices were only about 10 percent less). But how to choose among 28 hotels?
Sensing my indecision, the clerk handed me a scrapbook filled with hotel brochures. Soon I'd decided on the Pousada de Sao Tiago, a small hotel constructed in the remains of a 17th-century Portuguese fort. At its normal rate of around $150, the pousada would have been too expensive for me. But at the agent's price of $83, I could afford to go upscale, while treating myself to one of the few Macao hotels with historic architecture.
In another five minutes, the agent had completed my hotel booking and booked my ferry tickets (round trip is around $35). "I'll call the hotel with your arrival time and they'll pick you up at the ferry terminal," she said.
I wondered why the Macao hotels were so eager to deal -- were they still starved for the tourists who fled after the triad wars? Or was Macao an Asian Las Vegas, luring visitors to its shores with outrageous discounts in hopes they would lose their shirts at the tables? Probably a bit of both, I figured. Still, I was feeling skeptical.
When I walked out of the Macao ferry terminal to the pickup area, and saw a row of vans lined up for just about every hotel in the book except the Pousada de Sao Tiago, my inner cynic said "I told you so!" I headed back into the terminal, to the office of the Macao Government Tourist Authority, and loaded up on brochures, maps and a "passport" book of discounts to museums and shops, then dragged my bags back into the lobby, wondering if I should hire a taxi.
A man in a dark suit and cap approached me and I got ready to bargain. But he reached for my suitcase, made a reasonable stab at pronouncing my name, and led me to a shiny black Mercedes (the hotel's car) that had been waiting for me at the curb all along.
Passing through the wall of modern concrete hotels that separates the terminal area from the old city, I was glad I'd chosen the pousada, which is on the other side of the Macao peninsula from the ferry. The hotels, most of which have casinos, absorb the majority of the Hong Kong visitors, who come, straight off the boats, to gamble.
But beyond the concrete towers is a rich urban landscape of mostly two- and three-story buildings, dating back at least 100 years, and in some cases many more. A typical facade had European rococo plaster flourishes surrounding Chinese characters.
The entryway to the pousada is a stone staircase that leads up through a narrow passageway. Climbing up the damp tunnel I half expected to find a cannon at the top instead of the front desk. Two clerks handed me a registration form in English, Chinese and Portuguese. Assuming that the latter was the European lingua franca in town, I introduced myself in Portuguese -- to blank, uncomprehending stares. I switched to English. "Doesn't anyone speak Portuguese here?" No, they said.
In my room -- large and grand in the Iberian style, with heavy mahogany furniture, tiled floors and a private balcony overlooking the water -- the folder of information and the room service menu were in Portuguese. As were the signs on just about every public building, street and bus. But I never heard the language spoken. The signs for farmacias and avenidas seemed artifacts of a different century.
I could easily have spent three entire days wandering these avenidas like an Indiana Jones, popping into shadowy shops; exploring the multitiered Taoist Temple of A-Ma; then lingering at twilight in the Latin plaza that dominates Macao's center, the Largo do Leal Senado. Getting around was easy -- Macao is walkable, and when I got tired I hopped onto a bus. After realizing that few of the Portuguese names on my map were in regular use by average Macanese, I asked the hotel staff to tell me the Chinese names of a few main landmarks.
Once I could tell the bus drivers where I was headed in the right language (in Macao that's Cantonese), I covered a lot of ground. One morning I rode up the steep hill to see Macao's most fascinating architectural landmark, the ruins of St. Paul's Church. All that remains of this classic Portuguese-style church, dating from 1602 and nearly destroyed by fire in 1835, is the grand staircase and the magnificent original facade, which has been propped up by steel beams in the back and appears, from certain angles, to be a stage set.
Just above St. Paul's is an old Portuguese fort that was converted to a museum by the Portuguese shortly before the handover. The Macao Museum turned out to be a fascinating place. Its three floors contained well-designed and well-conceived exhibits that explained the city's polyglot history and provided insights into Macanese culture. I learned, for instance, about Macao's traditional cockroach-fighting tournaments -- a pastime so serious and all-absorbing that champion insects who fell in battle were laid to rest in specially carved wooden coffins.
The museum exhibits answered my questions about the curious things I'd observed on the streets. Those syrupy brown tonics were restorative herbal teas. The antique fireworks labels being sold came from factories that had been an important economic force in Macao for a century.
Another morning I rode a bus across a short causeway linking Macao's main peninsula to the islet of Taipa (also part of Macao), where I spent an hour poking around a village of one-story pastel houses that seemed transplanted straight from the Portuguese coast.
Nearby, according to my map, was the Taipa House Museum, a restored row of grand mansions built in the early 20th century by rich Portuguese merchants. Although the houses are open now, when I arrived they were closed for renovations; a crew of workmen perched on scaffolds, leisurely painting the mansions under the hot sun.
I'm not by nature a gambler, but I knew I couldn't leave Macao without at least visiting a casino. With the sun getting hotter, this seemed like a good moment to go.
The casino in the Hotel Lisboa is Macao's biggest. I passed through an X-ray scan into a large, dim room thronged with stone-faced men and women. There were no conversations to disturb the clack of playing tiles, the rattle of dice underneath glass domes. Gambling in Macao appears to be very serious business.
I stood for a while, trying to fathom the rules of the most popular game on the floor, a Chinese game of chance called Dai Siu (Big-Small). Gamblers flung Hong Kong dollars and Macao patacas onto the Chinese characters on the green felt-top table. And I was tempted to join them, once I'd mastered the basics. (You bet whether the dice will add up to a large or small number, with the odds about the same as hitting a red or black in roulette.) My fingers itched for the zipper on my bag. With a bit of luck, this trip to Macao could turn out to be really frugal!
But the temptation passed, as I realized that I'd already placed my bet on Macao, and hit the big time. A smart traveler knows when to quit. I walked out of the Lisboa Casino with all my patacas.
 
The bottom line: pinching patacas adds up to less than $120 a day
 I spent three days and nights in Macao; the total for hotel, meals, local transport and museum admissions came to $350.
Shops, hotels, casinos and restaurants in Macao do business in two currencies, the Hong Kong dollar and the Macao pataca. The prices below are calculated at 7.8 Hong Kong dollars to the United States dollar, and 8 patacas to the United States dollar.
 
Getting There
Fast ferries run every 15 minutes daily from the Hong Kong-Macao Ferry Terminal in the Shun Tak Center on Hong Kong Island. The trip takes about an hour. The economy fare from Hong Kong is $18, and the return trip from Macao is about $19.30.
 
Hotels
Several travel agencies in the Shun Tak Center, a shopping complex that connects with the Hong Kong-Macao Ferry Terminal, specialize in discounted hotel packages to Macao; the biggest discounts are for midweek stays.
At Macao South China Travel, Shop 318, Shun Tak Center, (852) 2815-0208, fax (852) 2544-9378, e-mail southchina@ctimail.com, I was able to book a standard room at the Pousada de Sao Tiago for $83 a night, which was about half the hotel's rack rate.
The 24-room Pousada de Sao Tiago, Avenida da Republica, (853) 378-111, fax (853) 552-170, www.saotiago
.com.mo, in a 17th-century Portuguese fort, has rooms on the second, third and fourth floors, up steep flights of stone steps. An alfresco restaurant looks out onto the bay.
I also inspected the 240-room Hotel Sintra, in a high-rise building closer to the center of town, at Avenida de Dom Joao IV, (853) 710-111, fax (853) 567-769. Although the outside was drab, rooms were large, cheerful and recently renovated, with sitting areas and ocean views. The midweek rates were around $60.
 
Restaurants
The Pousada de Sao Tiago's restaurant Cafe da Barra, is expensive but popular -- it has the best view in town. I had tea and sandwiches there one afternoon for about $9.
At Long Kei, 7B, Largo Do Leal Senado, (853) 573-970, I had an excellent Cantonese lunch of fried noodles with slices of garoupa (grouper) and bits of bok choi. With a beer, it came to $8.50.
There's a row of Macanese restaurants around the corner from the Pousada da Sao Tiago, along Rua do Almirante Sergio. The food combines the flavors of Lisbon and South China, with a bit of Mozambique peppers thrown in for spice.
At Barra Nova, 287 Rua do Almirante Sergio, (853) 965-118, I tried Macanese chicken -- stewed in a coconut-milk curry pepper sauce. Along with a soda, lunch cost $8.50. Next door at A Lorcha, (853) 313-193, a dinner of Cantonese roast chicken rubbed with hot peppers, codfish fritters and a glass of wine came to $21 with tax and tip.
Margaret's Cafe e Nata, Rua Comandante Mata e Oliveira, (853) 710-032, is a European-style cafe with outdoor tables, where strong cappuccino and a delicious Portuguese-style pastry was about $2.50.
 
Activities
The public museums in Macao are excellent, new and not expensive. The Macao Museum, in the fort adjacent to the St. Paul ruins, (853) 357-911), www.macaumuseum.gov.mo, contains three floors of historical and cultural exhibits, some of them interactive. Admission is $2, but with a discount "passport" voucher from the Macao Government Tourist Office (at the ferry terminal in Macao), my admission was $1.25. Closed Mondays.
The Macao Maritime Museum, Largo do Pagode da Barra, 1, (853) 595-481, another beautiful new museum, traces the history of European and Chinese sailors in the South China Sea. Admission is $1.25, or 63 cents with the voucher. A junk ride for tourists leaves several times a day from the museum's pier, and takes a 30-minute spin around the Macao peninsula; tickets are $1.25.
 
Transportation
Buses are the main form of public transport. Routes are marked on the tourist board's map, and the bus signs are in Portuguese and Chinese, with Western numbers. The fare around Macao is about 25 cents. DAISANN McLANE
