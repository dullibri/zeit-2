HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Federated in Surprise Profit; Kmart Net Rises Modestly

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: CINCINNATI, May 18

 BODY:
Federated Department Stores Inc. reported an unexpected quarterly profit of nearly $12 million today, a vast improvement from a loss of more than $64 million a year earlier.
And the Kmart Corporation, the second-biggest American retailer, said its quarterly earnings rose only slightly because bad weather in March and April hurt sales of seasonal goods. 
 Allen I. Questrom, Federated's chairman and chief executive, said, "Although our strong performance in the quarter was due in part to one-time promotional events, results did exceed our expectations."
Following are details of the companies' results:
 
Federated
 The company, based in Cincinnati, said it earned $11.8 million, or 15 cents a share, in its fiscal first quarter, which ended May 2. In the first quarter of 1991, when Federated was in Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization, it lost $64.2 million.
First-quarter sales totaled $1.57 billion, little changed from $1.59 billion a year earlier.
Federated operates 220 department stores under the names of Abraham & Straus, Bloomingdale's, Bon Marche, Burdines, Goldsmith's, Jordan Marsh, Lazarus, Rich's and Stern's.
Mr. Questrom said he expected that for the rest of the year, Federated's results would be closer to the company's target, which assumes the economy will stay soft in the second quarter and recover in the second half.
On the New York Stock Exchange, Federated's shares closed unchanged today at $12.375 each.
 
Kmart
 Kmart said profits for the quarter that ended April 29 rose 8.3 percent, to $116 million, or 26 cents a share, from $107 million, or 27 cents a share, a year earlier. The slight drop in per-share earnings reflected an increase in the number of outstanding shares.
Sales rose 9 percent, to $8.3 billion, from $7.6 billion in the period last year.
Kmart said results were hurt by colder-than-normal spring weather in the Northeast and Midwest, which caused consumers to delay purchases of lawn and garden items, home improvement goods and spring apparel.
Kmart's chairman, Joseph E. Antonini, said in a statement that the weather affected both March and April sales of seasonal items.
"On a brighter note, sales in a number of big-ticket categories, most notably home electronics, continued to improve, strongly indicating that the economic environment continues to strengthen and that the weakness in some of the seasonal categories was weather-related," he said.
Kmart's general merchandise stores earned $251 million in the quarter, up from $242 million a year earlier, while the specialty retail division earned $29 million, against $22 million a year earlier.
The company, based in Troy, Mich., has 2,379 Kmart general merchandise stores in the United States, Puerto Rico and Canada. Its specialty store chains are the Pace Membership Warehouse, Builders Square, Pay Less Drug Stores, Waldenbooks, Sports Authority and Office Max.
 Kmart shares closed down 25 cents yesterday at $46.625 on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Off in U.S. Trading; Gold Prices Mostly Lower

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar settled lower in quiet domestic trading yesterday, under pressure from events overnight in Europe.
Gold prices were mostly lower. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $338.90 a troy ounce, up 20 cents from Friday. The Republic National Bank said gold slipped 10 cents an ounce, to a late bid price of $338.40. 
 Analysts said the dollar's biggest moves occurred overnight in Asian trading. The currency sold on the heels of the surprise wage agreement reached between the powerful IG Metall metal workers' union and employers in Germany.
"That really strengthened the German mark against the dollar," said Andrew Busch, a trader with Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago.
The pay increase is expected to prevent the Bundesbank from easing German interest rates. The dollar fell below the psychologically important level of 1.6040 marks, generating a wave of additional selling. In New York, the dollar ended at 1.5950 German marks, down from 1.6105 late Friday.
An unconfirmed report that Switzerland is ready to begin talks on joining the European Community sent the Swiss franc sharply higher, also at the expense of the dollar. The Swiss Government is expected to make its decision public tomorrow. The dollar dropped to 1.4650 Swiss francs from 1.4855 in New York trading.
After heavy selling in foreign markets, the dollar held to a relatively narrow range when trading shifted to domestic markets, Mr. Busch said.
Interest-rate differentials continue to work against the the dollar. Today's meeting of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy, is widely expected to result in another downward notch in United States rates, a negative for the dollar.
Lower interest rates make dollar-denominated securities less valuable to investors. In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 129.68 yen, down 0.92 yen from Friday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 128.78 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 128.75 yen, down from 129.80 yen on Friday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.8355, from $1.8185 late Friday. In New York, it cost $1.8365 to buy one pound, more expensive than Friday's $1.8220.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's rates, included: 5.3580 French francs, down from 5.4065; 1,201.00 Italian lire, down from 1,212.00, and 1.1987 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2025.

HEADLINE: Japan Trade Surplus Up

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 18

 BODY:
Japan's trade surplus widened last month, climbing to an unadjusted $7.16 billion from $6.31 billion in April 1991, the Finance Ministry said today.
The gap in two-way trade with the United States, Japan's most vocal trade critic, ballooned to an unadjusted $3.29 billion surplus in April from $2.26 billion a year earlier. 
 Over all, customs-cleared exports rose 13 percent, to $27.24 billion from $24.11 billion, while imports lagged slightly, with a 12.8 percent rise to $20.07 billion from $17.79 billion, the ministry said.
"The Japanese Government must tell other nations what it will do to reduce the surplus," said Kusuo Aoki, a senior economist at Yamaichi Research Institute. "Japan has to go to the summit bearing gifts."
He was referring to a meeting scheduled for July in Munich, Germany, of leaders of the seven leading industrialized nations: Japan, the United States, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.
Although April's surplus fell from March's record high of $10.99 billion, economists said the decline was only seasonal and represented no change in the upward trend.
Exports increased to $27.24 billion in April from $24.11 billion a year earlier. Imports rose to $20.07 billion from $17.79 billion.
The growth in imports resulted mostly from the lifting of a temporary tax imposed on oil imports from April 1991 to March 1992. The rise did not mean Japan's imports were surging, economists said.

BYLINE: By Woody Hochswender

 BODY:

The New Informality
Lilacs bloomed in Central Park. Roller bladers zoomed down the park drives in sleek aerodynamic outfits, arms tucked close to their bodies.
People packed the theater district for new Broadway shows, tieless and skirtless in acid-washed jeans, sneakers and sweatshirts -- the new informality. 
 The hot new hat, spotted over the weekend everywhere from St. Marks Place to the "Yo, MTV Raps" show, is a long knit cap, like a stocking, tied at the top, sold at 555 Soul on Ludlow Street.
If high-designer looks were nowhere to be seen, it is not from lack of designer activity.
Vivienne Westwood, the first designer in recent years to show high-platform shoes, is bringing her path-finding clothes to New York on Thursday. The show will take place at the Limelight (of course) at 10 P.M.
Junko Koshino, a Japanese designer who shows her clothes on Paris runways, plans to open a "designer gallery" in New York on Wednesday.
Ms. Koshino, who is known for far-out fashions, will use the shop, at 450 Park Avenue between 56th and 57th Streets, to showcase her clothing, accessories and home furnishings. There are dresses made of neoprene, the scuba-diving fabric, with conical busts; spiky black wigs, like the ones Patti LaBelle wears, and square Lucite handbags. The walls are aluminum grill; the floor is slate.
Stephen Sprouse, who returned to the fashion scene designing four camouflage-print outfits for last night's Don't Bungle the Jungle IIrain forest benefit, has plans to get back in business. But he doesn't know how or when.
 
Furriers Not Discouraged
 Like their counterparts in the ready-to-wear business, New York's furriers did not stage big fashion shows during last week's fall openings. The recession has taken its toll on all areas of fashion, particularly the luxury level. But fur manufacturers sounded anything but discouraged.
"Business has been coming back sensationally," said Stanley Schulman, the president of Alixandre Furs, which makes Valentino and Calvin Klein furs. "One reason is that store inventories have bottomed out, just as people with money are beginning to spend again. Those of us remaining in business are doing better."
Mr. Schulman said store orders were up for the first time in three years, despite the fact that many retailers have phased out their fur departments, including Lord & Taylor, I. Magnin in Chicago and Frederick & Nelson in Seattle.
Some furriers, including Mohl, which makes Arnold Scaasi's designs, and Wagner, which makes Oscar de la Renta's, have found greater acceptance in international markets, like Japan, Switzerland and Italy, where the spray-paint can is not an everyday threat.
Another encouraging sign: The use of fur trimmings, on cuffs and collars, was widespread in the recent European collections, although in many instances, the fur was faux.
 
Seeking Peace
 In the wake of the Los Angeles riots, Marithe and Francois Girbaud, the French designers of jeans and other casual wear popular with urban American youth, have introduced an educational program they call the "Peace Movement."
The course includes exercises in self-awareness and communication skills for sixth, seventh and eighth graders, "so they can learn to negotiate and mediate differences without resorting to violence," said a company statement.
The exercises will be presented this month to students and teachers in middle schools in the Greensboro, N.C., area, where the Girbaud manufacturing operations are based.

HEADLINE: Federal Panel Says Simple Steps Could Limit Bedsores

BYLINE: By WARREN E. LEARY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 18

 BODY:
Bedsores, the painful and potentially dangerous pressure ulcers afflicting thousands of patients in nursing homes and hospitals, could be reduced significantly by relatively simple preventive measures, an expert panel said today.
The panel, convened by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research to develop new Federal guidelines, said much suffering could be reduced among people confined to beds or wheelchairs if health workers were more aware of the problem and the easy ways available to monitor and prevent bedsores. 
 The leader of the panel, Dr. Nancy Bergstrom, a professor of nursing at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, said she wanted to dispel the myth that bedsores were inevitable among those confined to a bed or chair.
 
Avoidable in Most Cases
 "The vast majority of pressure ulcers can be predicted and prevented, and those early ones that do occur need not worsen," Dr. Bergstrom said at a news briefing.
The guidelines called for doctors and nurses to check the skin of immobile and confined patients daily, keep incontinent patients dry, prevent skin dryness by using humidifiers and moisturizing lotion, moving immobile patients regularly, and supporting them with pillows, pieces of foam or special mattress covers designed to reduce pressure.
Bedsores result when skin is squeezed against bony parts of the body, like the heels or hips. Constant pressure squeezes tiny blood vessels that supply the skin with nutrients and oxygen, without which skin tissue dies and an ulcer forms. In severe cases, the tissue damage extends deep into the muscle and bone, sometimes causing serious infections and requiring surgery.
Dr. Bergstrom said it was difficult to determine the true incidence and economic effects of bedsores because the condition often went unreported, particularly with people who are cared for in their homes or at private health centers. One study estimated the annual economic cost at $1.3 billion to $6.4 billion for hospitalized patients alone, she said.
Dr. J. Jarrett Clinton, administrator of the agency, said though there were no exact figures, data from several sources indicated that up to one-third of nursing home patients had bedsores, as did about 10 percent of those in acute-care hospitals.
"If the health care community adopts the pressure ulcer guideline released today, these numbers will come down," Dr. Clinton said. "This is not to say that pressure ulcer prevention is inexpensive. But from all indications, prevention of these injuries is less costly than treatment."
The Agency for Health Care Policy and Research is a unit of the Public Health Service created by Congressional order to develop guidelines for doctors, nurses and other health workers to assure consistent, cost-effective treatment for Americans. The agency sponsors panels of independent experts who draw up recommendations. Before guidelines are completed, they are tested at hospitals and other health centers.
Dr. Bergstrom said the new guidelines covered prevention and treatment of the first and less-severe stage of bedsores. Later guidelines will focus on treating advanced forms of the condition, she said.
Stage-one bedsores are marked by a deep red or purplish coloration on the skin. If a finger is pressed against the area momentarily and then removed, normal skin color does not return and the area remains deep red, Dr. Bergstrom said. This type of bedsore may be difficult to identify in patients with dark skin, the panel said.
The risk of developing bedsores increases with a patient's level of immobility, nutritional deficiencies and in cases where the patient's skin is wet with urine, perspiration or wound drainage, the panel said. People at highest risk include hospitalized quadriplegics and paraplegics, elderly patients with hip fractures, orthopedic patients immobilized by other fractures, and people being treated in critical-care units.
The 13-member panel, which included nurses, doctors, researchers, therapists, educators and a consumer representative, recommended that bedsores be approached as a multidisciplinary problem to be dealt with comprehensively and early by a number of medical specialties before they become more severe.
To assure availability of the pressure ulcer guidelines, they will be distributed to doctors, nurses and other health workers through state and national professional organizations. In addition, a summary of the physicians' guidelines and a special patient's guide are available free by calling 1-800-358-9295 or by writing AHCPR Publications Clearinghouse, P.O. Box 8547, Silver Spring, Md., 20907.


GRAPHIC: Anyone who must stay in bed or in a chair can get pressure ulcers. They form where bone exerts the greatest force on skin and tissue, squeezing them against an outside surface. In bed, most appear on the lower back, shoulder blades, back of head and spine. (Source: Agency for Health Care Policy and Research)

HEADLINE: Environmentalists Accuse U.S. Of Trying to Weaken Global Treaty

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, May 18

 BODY:
As negotiations draw to a close here on an international treaty to slow the world's steady loss of plant, animal and microbial species, the United States is being accused by environmental groups of trying to weaken the agreement due to be signed at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro next month.
Biologists have warned that unless international action is taken to curb the destruction of species, a mass extinction of epic proportions will result within a few decades. 
 American officials involved in the negotiations said it was possible that the completed version would be unacceptable to the Bush Administration. If so, they said, President Bush will not sign it when he attends the meeting in Brazil with other heads of government.
 
Bush Administration's Objections
 "The chances are only 50-50 that the treaty will have satisfactory language on the issues fundamental to the United States," said E. Curtis Bohlen, Assistant Secretary of State for the environment.
He said the Administration had a wide range of objections, including concerns about provisions that would adversely affect the growing biotechnology industry in the United States.
Representatives of the World Wide Fund for Nature, which is based in Switzerland, and the Washington-based Defenders of Wildlife said the United States delegation was trying to eliminate the requirement that each country adopt regulations to conserve its wildlife and to eliminate procedures to make one nation responsible for insuring that its private companies do not harm the wildlife of other nations.
The groups circulated a memorandum from the office of Vice President Dan Quayle that said the draft treaty was so "extensively flawed" that it was "highly unlikely" the negotiations here would resolve the Administration's concerns.
Delegates from European nations and Japan, as well as most developing countries, have indicated that their heads of government will sign the biodiversity treaty if agreement on its contents is reached here.
The United States agreed this month to sign a climate treaty aimed at limiting emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases that contribute to global warming.
The climate and biodiversity treaties, intended to be binding agreements that would require nations to take conserving actions, are regarded as the most important substantive matters at the Brazil gathering.
At the heart of the discussions here are the measures that nations would be required to take in conserving species, habitats and ecosystems.
The United Nations, whose environmental program is based in this East African capital, has said that without special efforts the world faces a "wave of extinctions unmatched in 60 million years."
"It has been suggested that up to 25 percent of the species now living will become extinct within a single human lifetime," said the executive director of the United Nations Environment Program, Mostafa K. Tolba of Egypt.
The biodiversity treaty draws special attention to the conservation of species in developing countries, where most of the world's biodiversity is found. In the last decade, more than 90 percent of the varieties of wild seeds that have been collected were found in the third world, United Nations ecologists say.
Seeking to help these impoverished countries preserve their ecosystems and wildlife, the treaty includes financial help. This would be done through the Global Environmental Facility, a new mechanism to channel funds for environmental protection from developed countries to poorer ones.
Mr. Bohlen, who is not attending the Nairobi negotiations but talks to the American delegation by phone, said from Washington that the United States had a number of objections to the draft treaty as now formulated.
He said the treaty would force the Federal Government to take the primary responsibility for the conservation of wildlife away from the states. The Government has the responsibility only for endangered and migratory species, Mr. Bohlen said. The Bush Administration objections to the transfer were not the only obstacle: the Senate would never ratify a treaty with such a provision, he said.
Seeking to limit the degradation by wealthy corporations of the oceans and ecosystems in developing countries, the treaty makes nations responsible for the environmental effects of their private companies' activities in other countries. Thus, if an American company wanted to log in an African forest, the United States would be responsible for insuring that an environmental impact assessment was completed.
The two senior members of the Congressional delegation to Rio, Senators Al Gore, Democrat of Tennessee, and John H. Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island, wrote to Mr. Bush that they strongly supported the principle that a country should be responsible for actions under its control, whether inside or outside the boundaries of the country.
But Mr. Bohlen said the Administration opposed the provision.
On biotechnology provisions of the treaty, Mr. Bohlen said the United States objected to efforts to regulate the industry. "We believe biotechnology should be addressed separately from biodiversity," he said. He said Washington disliked what it regarded to be a premise in the treaty that all genetically altered organisms were inherently unsafe.
A major issue under the rubric of biotechnology is the ownership of genetic material. Historically, seeds, germ plasm and specimens of individual species have been in the public domain. Anyone could exploit them without compensating the nation of origin.
Thus, the rosy periwinkle, a plant found only in the tropical rain forests of eastern Madagascar, has provided the basis for a drug used to combat childhood leukemia and Hodgkin's disease. Madagascar, a country of widespread hunger and unemployment, has received virtually no compensation for the plant, according to the United Nations.
 
Paying for Genetic Material
 The draft treaty seeks to insure compensation to underdeveloped countries for their genetic materials. Mr. Bohlen said the United States agreed with the principle that such nations should share in the economic benefits, but said the question was how that was to accomplished.
He said the United States was favored the principle of including compensation in the treaty but believed the mechanisms should be arranged by the countries concerned.
And one of the most contentious issues in the treaty between the rich countries of the north and the generally indigent nations of the south is the question of technology transfer. The developing countries are asking for transfers of biotechnology advances on a concessionary basis.
"The United States cannot agree on behalf of a private company to this, and we have a strong commitment to intellectual property rights," Mr. Bohlen said.

HEADLINE: AUTO RACING;
St. James Is Steering Her Own Course to Indy

BYLINE: By JOSEPH SIANO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: INDIANAPOLIS, May 18

 BODY:
Lyn St. James will not be taking many telephone calls at her apartment here this week. Each day, she will be sitting in a spare bedroom, wearing a fire-retardant suit and crash helmet, driving in the Indianapolis 500.
America's most famous auto race hasn't moved indoors. It will be run on Sunday, as scheduled, before about 325,000 spectators at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. 
 St. James is simply using a simulated chassis of a race car -- her own innovation -- in a very precise game of pretend, trying to duplicate the mental and physical demands of the race as she prepares to become only the second woman to drive in the Indy 500.
Auto racing, like horse racing, is one of the very few sports in which women compete against men at the highest level. Ascending to this level has required St. James to overcome conditions more forbidding than any she might be simulating in her preparation for this weekend.
 
A Racer First
 Before last Saturday, when St. James drove a Lola-Chevy for four laps around the two-and-a-half-mile Speedway at an average speed of 220.150 miles an hour, only Janet Guthrie had qualified to enter a bastion so alien to women that she had to leave the garage area wearing her driver's suit and mingle with spectators when she needed a restroom.
That particular situation has changed, and so has the pioneering atmosphere that defined Guthrie when she competed in the race from 1977-79. St. James, 45 years old, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., insists that she sees herself as racer first, with the groundbreaker role several laps behind.
"This is for me," she said. "This is a goal that I've had in meeting a career objective. It's a personally driven thing that I know could have ancillary benefits to it, but which I can't control."
In order for more women to ascend to the highest level of this sport, they will first have to master another sport, that of acquiring corporate sponsors.
St. James had to approach about 150 companies before she found two -- JC Penney and Agency Rent-a-Car -- willing to provide the minimum of $500,000 total to bankroll her effort here. Although St. James has been enterprising enough to turn her singularity in a male-dominated sport on its head by approaching companies that sell products to women, she has been turned down by, among others, major cosmetics companies.
But St. James demurs from blaming sexism for the paucity of female drivers here.
"If you knew how many licensed professional race drivers there are and how hard it is to get here," she said, "the odds are so much against you that in the big picture, the gender issue is such a small thing."
Guthrie, who retired from top-level racing in 1980, agrees, to an extent, that difficulty in getting sponsorship in a weak economy is an equal-opportunity impediment.
"But I must point out that the starting fields at major races remain full," Guthrie said last week, "and they are full of sponsored male drivers."
 
Sport of Individuals
 And some of them, she noted, promote laundry detergent and other products bought largely by women.
The difficulty in making inroads stems more from the fact that auto racing, unlike major professional team sports, does not have an organized, talent-based system of advancement from grass-roots to the elite level. It is a sport of individuals, who forge their way through the corporate structure in a search for ever-higher amounts of sponsorship money -- up into the millions of dollars necessary for a full season of Indianapolis-car racing. St. James describes with delight her first meeting with the three decision-makers from Penney. They were all women and it didn't hurt, she adds, that one drove a Porsche and another a Jaguar.
What has eased St. James's path to Indy is the fact that she is the most experienced female racer in this country, and very likely the world. Besides beating men in a highly competitive professional sports-car series in the 1980's, she has extensive experience racing at the 225-m.p.h. speeds the cars are expected to reach here on Sunday.
Dick Simon, who owns St. James's car and was a co-driver, on the same team as Guthrie, said St. James had the respect of her male competitors.
"At this time, she is a race driver," Simon said before she qualified, "and I think you can witness that when the drivers drive up alongside of her or enter the corner with her, they're not gun-shy at all. They pull right up alongside of her and they have all the respect in the world."
 
Decade of Preparation
 Getting that kind of respect from the men who drive these cars is hard. They have the demeanor of fighter pilots, which helps when your car is exceeding the take-off speed of a commercial jet. One twitch of the steering wheel by a rookie, as St. James is here, can get a veteran into a crash.
"Everything I've done in the last 10 or 12 years professionally has been in preparation for this," said St. James.
She was speaking of her on-track experience, which includes being on the winning team of drivers in the 1987 24-hour race at Daytona and being victorious in a sports-car series that is one of the key training grounds for promising young drivers.
St. James and Simon, who has been her mentor through her effort at Indy, believe that if she drives her best on Sunday, and the car has no mechanical problems, she can finish in the top 10 in the 33-car field. Based on last year's race, the smallest amount of money she can expect to win is about $125,000.
But more fundamental preparations occurred long before she learned her first racing lesson in the mid-1970's by losing control of a Pinto and driving it into a lake.
 
From the Secretarial Pool
 One of the people St. James can thank for her business education is the man who was the personnel director at a major steelmaker's offices in Cleveland, where St. James had one of her first jobs, as a secretary.
He took one look at a letter of resignation from St. James, who felt powerless against the company's rigid promotion system, and told her: "Secretaries don't write letters of resignation, they just quit."
She can also thank an all-girls school in her birthplace of Willoughby, Ohio, a school that filled her head with a revolutionary concept for the early 1960's: self-reliance (and led her to hang around with "car-crazy" boys in search of some male friends).
In a way, credit also should go to her frustration at being thought of simply as the wife of her business partner, frustration that led her to change her married name from Caruso one night after watching the actress Susan Saint James in the television series "McMillan and Wife."
These experiences all helped forge the businesswoman who would build her own auto-parts company, become a consumer adviser for Ford Motor Company and create a lucrative career teaching women how to walk into a car showroom or service department and speak the automotive language.
 
The 1960's and Muscle Cars
 The last six years of St. James's formal education took place at the Andrews School for Girls, on a 300-acre campus in Willoughby, a middle-class suburb of Cleveland a few miles from Lake Erie.
"Maybe because of going to an all-girls school and having no brothers, as a balancing effect, I had boys as my friends outside school," St. James said. "And this was in the 1960's, so they were all into muscle cars."
They were also into auto racing, and took her to the Indy 500, sparking her interest in racing.
Andrews, meanwhile, was teaching her something else -- as it has with all its students since it opened, one year before the first Indianapolis 500.
"Andrews was founded in 1910 as a school to make young women independent, which in 1910 wasn't such a popular idea," said Barbara Caseau, who has taught there for 33 years.
Caseau remembers St. James as one of her ninth-grade students. "It was sort of her excitement," said Caseau, "and the spirit that she had to go for what she wanted, even as a kid. Not in an aggressive way at all, but more like 'I know I can do this, and if I can't do it this way, I'll do it this way.' And that has certainly borne out in her life."
 
'Power of the Individual'
 Last June, St. James gave the commencement speech at Andrews, and the 23 graduates heard her describe how racing had provided gasoline-powered assertiveness training.
"It wasn't until I drove that first race car that I realized the power of the individual," St. James said.
It was only a Pinto, a vague ancestor to the 750-horsepower car she now races, but the feelings are likely to be the same when she sits on the starting grid Sunday and hears the command (which now might be changed) of "Gentlemen, start your engines."
"All of a sudden I felt powerful," she told the graduates. "I felt like I had never felt doing anything else."

HEADLINE: Fight Haiti's Thugs With Oil

 BODY:
Seven months of economic pressure from the Organization of American States have failed to budge the thugs who hijacked Haiti's infant democracy last fall. Negotiations are stalemated -- yet the crisis of repression boils ever hotter. Recent weeks have seen ever-more desperate refugees again fleeing in flimsy boats.
Sunday the O.A.S. rightly decided to tighten the economic screws. Ships that trade with Haiti will be turned back from ports in O.A.S.-member nations. Supporters of the outlaw regime will be denied visas. And European countries will be urged to suspend trade. 
 Sound steps all, but by themselves insufficient. The partial embargo so far has failed because it left the ruling gang time to find loopholes. The biggest loophole has been the European Community, and the key commodity has been oil.
The most plausible path to democracy is a complete cutoff of oil imports. The most likely way to achieve that is for the Bush Administration to lean on its European allies.
Last fall, when oil was scarce for a few weeks, the diplomatic process came alive. But after a few tankers unloaded, the military leaders dug in again. The latest compromise, negotiated in Washington early this year, lost any chance of parliamentary approval after hard-liners intimidated legislators in Port-au-Prince. Yet there's reason to believe some military leaders would accept compromise under credible pressure.
The renewed interest of other countries in Haiti's crisis may well be prompted by the increased refugee traffic. The Bush Administration's policies, in particular, seem to have been driven, shamefully, by fear of reaction to admitting thousands of poor Haitians to Florida. For months, those fears led Washington to understate the repression in Haiti -- and to assert the right to repatriate Haitians forcibly.
The Administration has won judicial support for that claim and acted on it. Even so, Haiti's poor continue to set sail, in ever-larger numbers. Increasingly, it seems evident that the only way to stem the tide is to achieve a fair political settlement in Haiti, one that encourages people to stay in their homeland. Only increased economic pressure is likely to bring such a settlement.
The United States can do much to make the embargo more effective by monitoring Haiti's ports and urging European allies to cooperate. If that isn't enough, a future O.A.S. meeting could be called on to impose a naval blockade. Such a blockade would be an act of war, but one that poses scant risk of wider conflict. Such a measure lacks firm precedent in international law, but the O.A.S. is entitled to defend democracy against violent and illegal challenges.
No hemispheric policy can guarantee that freedom and civilian rule are restored to Haiti. But the hemisphere's democracies do right to stand up for principle. They serve Haitians as well as themselves by trying to promote alternatives to the continuing tragedy of poor people in such despair they would rather set sail in matchstick boats than risk the political tides on land at home.

HEADLINE: Mr. Bush's Political Environment

 BODY:
The "Environment President" now seems mainly interested in becoming the "Re-elected President." Twice in one week, on the issues of air pollution and forests, the Bush Administration has handed down rulings that sacrifice long-term environmental concerns to short-term commercial and political interests.
And perversely, in both instances, the Administration, even while enraging environmentalists, offers false promises to the interests whose favor it wishes to curry in this election year. 
 The most recent example is last week's decision by Vice President Quayle and the Council on Competitiveness to allow companies to increase pollution emissions without public hearings. Mr. Quayle argued that public reviews might delay changes in manufacturing processes to improve efficiency and competitiveness.
Nevertheless, the ruling is an empty promise. The Clean Air Act -- which Mr. Bush hails as his major environmental achievement -- explicitly requires "public comment." The ruling is therefore likely to invite lawsuits that could deny industry the flexibility Mr. Quayle seeks. The ruling also runs counter to some state regulations requiring public review, inviting bitter legal battle.
Finally, it embarrasses the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, William Reilly, whose plan to give industry some leeway within the spirit of the law was rejected.
It was not one of Mr. Reilly's better weeks. Just as he was losing on the pollution issue, a Cabinet-level committee chaired by Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan voted to override both Mr. Reilly and the Endangered Species Act and permit logging on 1,700 acres of Federal land in Oregon that is home to the threatened northern spotted owl. The 1,700 acres don't amount to much, either to the owl or the loggers. At the same time, however, Mr. Lujan also announced a broader "preservation plan" setting aside about 2.8 million acres for the spotted owl -- about half the acreage mandated by the Endangered Species Act and the courts. Mr. Lujan said his plan would save half the 32,000 jobs that would otherwise be lost.
Again, false promises, both to the owl and the loggers. Mr. Lujan's own biologists say the owl can't survive on less than five million acres. Nor will all that many jobs be "saved" by cutting the owl's habitat in half. There will be a short-run saving. But loggers are already fighting relentless market forces. Automation and industry's shift to the Southeast have cost more jobs than the owl.
And when Mr. Lujan's vulnerable acreage is gone, more logging jobs will also disappear. Neither do his calculations include the jobs that will be lost in other industries if heavy logging continues -- in tourism, for example, and salmon fishing, which depends on streams undamaged by over-cutting.
There are two bills in the House that would put more than six million acres off limits to logging. That's probably enough to save the owl, fishing and tourism. Both bills also seek to cushion the economic hardship in local communities.
Neither bill is perfect; yet both seek to demonstrate a just balance between economic needs and the environment. Whether the issue is clean air and jobs, or forests and jobs, the Bush Administration has so far produced an unwise balance.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Straight In the Eye

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
Once and only once, I knew a national leader who told the truth to his people about the most important things in their lives -- themselves.
This man told them that they were superstitious and slovenly. He denounced their religion, customs, manners, furies and hatreds. He told them that sometimes they were so dense that they drove him mad. 
 Jawaharlal Nehru was not a great all-round leader. His foreign policy for India was a mess of platitudes and self-delusion.
About economics, Chakravarti Rajagopalachari, the first Indian Governor General of India, called Nehru a woolly-headed Socialist idiot. Looking back that strikes me as a little harsh but certainly in the ball park.
But how Nehru could lay about him when he felt his own people were leading themselves deeper into darkness through bigotry, casteism, violence or calcification of mind!
I wonder whether the United States will ever produce a Presidential candidate who will give us the gift of truth about ourselves.
What we have been getting from our candidates is mostly pure smarm. They allow us to blame everybody else and comfortingly lead our little minds away from our own contributions to bigotry, casteism, violence and calcification. We get the message that with a little economic higgledy-piggledy, never really explained, the country can solve its troubles without pain -- otherwise known as higher taxes, more schoolwork and no excuses.
No excuses means none from those who riot and loot, none from the preachers of bigotry and those who prettify them, none from dropouts, none from politicians. And none from voters who destroy any politician who is brave enough to tell us the bill will be high, with payments starting now.
Who will face the country straight? Who will look it in the eye?
President Bush? His campaign has become one long dreary attempt to rationalize or deny his failures.
Bill Clinton -- what's happened there anyway? Presented by Los Angeles with an opportunity for inspiring the country, he is fumbling it. He still has time to roll up the political safety net he lugs around and take more chances with candor, but not a lot of time. He is losing the country's attention.
Will Ross Perot have the courage to talk straight, or will we just get a lot more down-home one-liners? So far, he has presented the country with a blank tablet. That worked for a while because millions of Americans wrote their own hopes on it. And about Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton, he follows an old safe policy: never interrupt your opponents while they are making fools of themselves.
But he says soon he will show us his mind. If so, that will reveal whether he is capable of the hard intellectualism, the discipline, required for telling us the truths about ourselves and our problems.
If he thinks the country has to work harder, then how will he provide the jobs for those who want nothing but the chance to work?
Does he think the jobs can be created and the neglect of the cities rectified without more taxes? Then he has to show us the balance sheet any businessman would demand before investing money or trust in any investment salesman.
And although during campaigns candidates pretend foreign affairs are no great deal now, if he wins he will be neck deep in them the day after election.
So let's have a rundown on what he will do about starvation in Africa, aid to the former Soviet Union, the worldwide Communist Chinese missile trade and Saddam Hussein, happy, fat and born again.
President Perot -- it's a massive rebuke to the Messrs. Bush and Clinton that so many Americans like the idea and so few now dismiss it. And it is a compliment that he now should show he deserves. The only way is to say what he would demand of himself and the American public.
Many Americans, perhaps more as time goes on, will still want something he will find hard to deliver -- evidence that he could run a government and understand the delicate, essential balances that make it a democracy, not a horse.
But win, place or show, Ross Perot if he is brave enough can certainly do one thing. He can talk straight to the public and himself. That could help the country look itself in the eye, the essential price of starting to recover from Los Angeles.

HEADLINE: China's Rights Abuses Reflect a Bitter History

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"China Is Reported to Plan Release of Some Political Prisoners Soon" (news article, May 6) discussed photographs, provided by the Chinese Government, of Wang Juntao and Chen Ziming, two leading pro-democracy activists. The photos were given to John T. Kamm, an American businessman who serves as a conduit for information that Beijing releases to the West. Given the previous official disinformation provided on the status of these two men, the photos, which suggest that Mr. Wang and Mr. Chen are in good health, are highly suspect.
Wang Juntao and Chen Ziming, founders of the Beijing Economic and Social Sciences Research Institute, an unofficial think tank, were branded by Beijing as the two "masterminds" of the 1989 democracy movement. Arrested after the violence in Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989, they were held for more than a year without charges, rushed to trial when world attention was focused on the Persian Gulf and quickly sentenced to 13 years' imprisonment. 
 After his conviction, Mr. Wang, who was seriously ill with hepatitis B, was kept in punitive solitary confinement in Beijing No. 2 Prison. He was held in a tiny, airless cell, with an overflowing toilet and a wooden mattress infested by vermin. Mr. Chen was locked up in similar conditions. Mr. Wang's numerous requests for medical care were denied by prison authorities.
Last August both Mr. Wang and Mr. Chen went on hunger strikes to protest their mistreatment. At the time the Justice Ministry firmly asserted that both men were eating well and gaining weight. To undercut a wave of international concern, Beijing went so far as to release television footage allegedly showing a healthy-looking Mr. Wang. Only after international pressure continued did the authorities finally move Mr. Wang to a prison hospital and acknowledge that he was suffering from hepatitis.
The timing of the release of these new photographs is hardly surprising. It is part of a pattern that has emerged as the Chinese Government has been forced to deal with growing human rights criticism. To defuse criticism as important dates on China's "human rights calendar" approach, the authorities issue incredible accounts of prisoners that cannot be verified.
One month earlier Mr. Kamm was quoted in your April 8 news article relaying the official account that China's most famous imprisoned dissident, Wei Jingsheng, was living well in his 13th year of solitary confinement -- watching television, reading several daily newspapers and debating with his guards. This contradicts all previous reports, including one in The Times, which have stated that Mr. Wei may be suffering from schizophrenia, has lost all his teeth and is in general poor health.
Beijing maintains a vast prison system that physically and mentally tortures large numbers of prisoners, including democracy activists. Wei Jingsheng's abuse in solitary confinement is bitter history. That two brilliant men like Wang Juntao and Chen Ziming are facing the same fate is tragic. They stand as symbols of China's gross abuse of human rights.

HEADLINE: For 100 Years, 'Forever Wild' and Forever in Dispute;
The Adirondack Park Remains the Focus of a Clash Between Preservation and Commerce

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BLUE MOUNTAIN LAKE, N.Y.

 BODY:
A hundred years ago, after vast timber cuts had denuded sections of the majestic Adirondack forest and turned rivers brown with silt, the Legislature stepped in. The Adirondack Park was created, with parts to be "forever wild," a preserve of mountains, lakes and woods.
This week the park, the largest in the country outside of Alaska, marks its centennial. But the clash between commerce and preservation has not ended: instead of lumberjacks, developers are pushing at the edges of the wilderness. 
 The fierceness of the struggle is rooted in the unusual nature of the Adirondack Park. It is home not just to dozens of spectacular peaks and 31,000 miles of rivers and streams, but to 130,000 people, living in hamlets scattered through the mountains, where several Adirondack counties are routinely at the top of the state's list for unemployment and poverty rates.
A panel appointed by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, warning of a "last clear chance" to preserve the wilderness character of the region, has recommended a sweeping package of new zoning laws and conservation incentives to curb development on the private land within the park, where there has been a 43 percent increase in the number of homes in the last two decades. But for more than two years, the state Legislature has failed to act on any of the 245 recommendations.
 
Years of Talk, No Action
 And though many local officials contend that the gravest threat is not to the wilderness but to hard-pressed residents, various proposals to help the region's perennially battered economy have foundered as well.
The result is that for all the fervent debate in recent years, virtually nothing has been done in that time to help either the Adirondacks or the Adirondackers, environmentalists and the local officials agree.
The lack of action has serious consequences even beyond the 6-million-acre park, because a legislative blueprint for the Adirondacks was widely expected to serve as a national model of long-range planning to insure that both vast pockets of wilderness and the villages among them could thrive.
The fact that the Adirondack Park is a patchwork of public wilderness, timber tracts and private land makes its future a more nettlesome question in many ways than the issue of how to protect places like Yellowstone, Grand Canyon, Glacier and Olympic National Parks -- all of which, taken together, are smaller than Adirondack Park alone.
"A national park is, almost by definition, a place where few people actually live," said Peter A. A. Berle, the president of National Audubon Society, who also served as chairman of the Governor's Adirondacks commission.
"In the Adirondacks," he added, we're talking about a park that involves both people and wild space, both hamlets and open space. That's the difference. And that's also why any solutions there will apply much more broadly."
The Adirondacks are still a place of spectacular natural beauty, of high-peaks wilderness and clear mountain lakes. And while some of the vistas are not so lofty as those in parts of the western United States, the Adirondacks remain a remarkably accessible place, where the forests do more than beckon. There are hundreds of trails just off the main roads in the park, where a hiker needs all of three minutes before being completely immersed in the woods.
By some measures, the park is in better shape than it was a century ago. About 87 percent of the land is covered by forests, a much higher percentage than in 1892, when the logging caused floods as far away as Albany.
But other pressures that would have seemed remote back then are now looming over the park, and these were the basis of the report by the Governor's commission, which was formed in 1988 in the wake of widespread concern about sales of more than 100,000 acres of land to second-home developers.
The number of single-family homes in the Adirondacks climbed from 50,000 in the late 1960's to 70,000 in the late 1980's, according to figures provided by the Adirondack Park Agency, the state body that administers existing land-use regulations in the park.
The number of seasonal residents in the park is estimated at 250,000.
And those statistics do not include units in several condominium developments built around Lake George and Lake Placid and in the Gore Mountain ski area near North Creek.
 
Clear Lakes Now Less So
 Much of the construction is in lakefront areas, and in recent years several large lakes -- including Lake George and Saranac Lake -- have been plagued by algae blooms and other deterioration traced to septic systems and other human activity.
And despite what was widely seen as a landmark set of land-use regulations adopted in the early 1970's, which increased the number of acres needed per house in most parts of the park, some state officials charged with preserving the wilderness say those laws will be insufficient to guard against a new real-estate boom when the recession lifts.
Robert C. Glennon, the executive director of the Adirondack Park Agency, noted that even with all the regulations in place, up to 400,000 houses could legally be built in the region.
"The scheme of the present statute guarantees the ultimate destruction of the Adirondack Park, and anoints us to preside over it," said Mr. Glennon. "It's that simple."
But critics of stricter regulation dismiss such concerns as hyperbole. "We have always questioned the underlying premise of the commission report, that there's a development crisis," said Frederick H. Monroe, a town supervisor in Chester, which is within the park. "There isn't a crisis. We don't see the need for drastic changes."
An unwieldy collection of organizations, 18 by one recent count, have sprouted that all purport to speak for Adirondackers inside the park. There is an Adirondack Fairness Coalition, a Residents' Committee to Protect the Adirondacks, an Adirondack Solidarity Alliance.
 
A Certain Ambivalcence
 Much attention has been given to protesters at either extreme of the debate -- a radical environmentalist who said the solution was to move people out of the park altogether, an irate landowner who warned that new government regulators would come out of the park "in body bags." But many Adirondack residents seem more ambivalent about the future.
Hayden C. Tormey, who lives in the same brown-shingle house in the village of Onchiota where he was born 69 years ago, was an Adirondack guide who took tourists into the woods for 40 years before arthritis sidelined him.
He now hand-carves wooden loons and ducks to make a modest living, and, like many of the independent-minded people who live in the park, he says he does not exactly take kindly to the government. And some things in the Adirondack commission's report -- such as listing appropriate colors for the roofs of houses in the park -- irked him a great deal.
But, he added, when he decided to give up some family land on Lake Kushaqua several few years ago, he turned down offers from a developer and sold it to the state instead, at a lower price. "I wanted it to last," Mr. Tormey explained. " 'Forever wild,' like it says. In my mind anyway, that was the idea."
The official centennial celebration here will feature an address by Governor Cuomo, followed by a summer of activities ranging from workshops on how to make the classic Adirondack guide boat to a historical lecture on Adirondack diners.
 
Search for Common Ground
 There is also a traveling exhibition of photographs by Seneca Ray Stoddard, a bearded adventurer who in 1892 came to Albany, unpacked his easels and lanterns before curious lawmakers in the Capitol, and left many of them gaping at his glass-plate photographs of the Adirondack wilderness. That was the final push that led to creation of the park.
But this time around, there appears to be no Seneca Ray Stoddard on the horizon, and certainly no legislative consensus.
Last week the Democratic-led Assembly offered a package of regulations less stringent than those proposed by the Governor's panel, known as the Commission on the Adirondacks in the 21st Century. But leaders of the Republican-controlled State Senate, reflecting local concerns about the region's perennially battered economy, declared that plan "dead on arrival."
The Republicans said they would push instead for bills to abolish the Adirondack Park Agency, and to provide village governments with more money for housing, roads and infrastructure repairs. And Mr. Cuomo, who rejected some of the commission ideas as too radical and has vowed to forge a compromise, is expected to offer his own bills.
In any event, just about everybody involved with the issue, both in and out of the park, says that change is needed. "No interest group agrees that the status quo is a preferable position for the Adirondacks," said Thomas C. Jorling, the state's Environmental Conservation Commissioner. "The key to this generation making its mark on this legacy is finding the common ground."

Chart/Map: "Forestry: The Adirondack State Park"
 
History
Created by an act of the Legislature May 20, 1892. The word "Adirondack" is generally believed to be derived from an Iroquois expression meaning "those who eat bark."
 
Geography
Originally 2.8 million acres; with additions over the years, there are now nearly 6 million acres, of which 42 percent is state-owned forest preserve designated "forever wild" under the state Constitution. Largest park in the continental United States. Encompasses one-fifth of New York State and is roughly equivalent in size to Vermont. Twelve counties are either fully or partly within the park's boundary.
 
Topography
31,000 miles of rivers and streams; 2,759 lakes and ponds. Roughly 87 percent of the park is forest land, a higher percentage than in 1892. There are 42 peaks higher than 4,000 feet, most of them in the northeast part of the park, including Mount Marcy, the highest point in New York State at 5,344 feet.
 
Population
130,000 year-round residents in 105 communities; about 250,000 seasonal residents.

HEADLINE: Dropout Rate Down Sharply for New York Schools

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
New York City yesterday reported a significant decline in the number of students dropping out of high school, putting it ahead of other major cities that have also noted such declines.
Board of Education officials claimed credit for the change, saying years of hounding truants and pressing students to complete their required courses were finally paying off. But they acknowledged that a sluggish economy, with diminished job prospects, might be partly responsible for the improvement. 
 The city's new survey showed that slightly more than 17 percent of the 70,510 students who started the ninth grade in the 1987-88 school year had dropped out four years later -- two full percentage points better than the rate achieved by the previous ninth-grade class, or a 10 percent overall improvement. The proportion of those who graduated also improved, rising 1.2 percentage points to 38.9 percent.
It was the best showing in the six years since New York City began a more precise system of tracking entering high school freshmen throughout their school careers and it clearly buoyed Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez, who took over the system two and a half years ago.
In that time, Mr. Fernandez has overhauled the city's dropout program developed by his predecessors, pushing for stronger links between troubled high schools and neighborhood and counseling organizations that work with students deemed prone to drop out. Since he came into office, the four-year dropout rate has been reduced from 20.8 percent, to 17.2 percent.
As rosy as the citywide totals were, they belie the fact that some individual schools are still failing to hold onto their students. The seven-year dropout rate of the class scheduled for graduation in 1988 stood at 47.7 percent in George Washington High School in Manhattan, 43.8 percent at Monroe in the Bronx, 52.4 percent at Thomas Jefferson in Brooklyn, and 34.8 percent at Franklin Lane in Queens.
The dropout rate, one of the most closely watched indicators of school performance, has shown improvement in cities across the nation. Roughly two-thirds of the nation's cities have reported declines in their dropout rates, said Michael Casserly, executive director of the Council of Great City Schools, an organization of urban school superintendents.
Far Rockaway High School in Queens, one of many schools that saw a sharp decline in dropouts, has a machine that telephones parents in the evenings and informs them through a recorded message that their youngsters were absent that day. Two staff members pay regular visits to truants' homes.
The school has also broken up its student body of 1,700 into seven "houses" arranged by career subjects, finding that diminishing a large high schools' anonymity makes it easier to form relations with students who might otherwise grow disenchanted with school.
 
National Comparisons
 New York City students fared particularly well in national comparisons, which are done by simply recording the percentage of students who drop out in a given year. Only 6.80 percent of students dropped out of the school system in the 1990-91 school year, one of the lowest figures of any major city.
By contrast, annual dropout rates in Chicago were 13.2 percent; in Los Angeles, 16 percent; in Houston, 9.4 percent, and in Philaldelphia, 8.4 percent. Figures for Houston and Los Angeles were based on the 1989-90 school year.
The annual New York statistics demonstrate anew that students are choosing to stay in school five, six and even seven years to complete their high school education. In the class originally supposed to graduate in June 1991, 38.9 percent of the 70,510 students did so on time, but 27.8 percent enrolled for a fifth year.
 
Reading Problems
 Monitoring of an earlier group of ninth graders -- the one that was supposed to graduate in June 1988 -- shows that by 1991 57.3 percent did in fact graduate and 27.5 percent dropped out. The graduation figure included both those who graduated with regular diplomas and the small proportion who obtained equivalency diplomas. The seven-year graduation rate has remained fairly constant, though Mr. Fernandez predicted that future classes would start to reflect the impact of his innovations.
School officials did not interview any of the 12,111 dropouts from the ninth-grade class of 1987-88 to find out why they left school. But statistical studies show that as freshmen, 70 percent were over age for their grade and had probably been left back in elementary school or junior high school. Almost half had bounced around two or more schools.
Only 30 percent could read at the level considered appropriate for their grade. Less than 30 percent had passed the required ninth-grade Regents Competency Test in mathematics, a daunting hurdle that seemed to have discouraged most of the dropouts. Many students, the report's authors said, also failed to accumulate enough credits to make graduation likely and dropped out in defeat.
Analayzing the findings in ethnic terms, the study said Asian-American students followed for four years had the lowest dropout rate -- 9.7 percent. The dropout rates for non-Hispanic whites was 11.6 percent; for non-Hispanic blacks, 17.9 percent, and for Hispanic students, 22.5 percent. Boys were slightly more likely to drop out than girls, though the report did not speculate why.
Those not counted as dropouts, graduates or currently enrolled students are youngsters who chose to transfer either to private and parochial schools or to public school systems outside the city. The board does not keep track of such students once they have left, said Robin Willner, the Board of Education's research director. But officials assume that the pattern of graduating and dropping out mirrors the rest of the city's population. About 16 percent of the freshman class of 1987-88 were in that category.
 
Impact of Economy
 Some educators believe that a sluggish economy with fewer job openings may be prompting more students to stay in school. Others theorize that the economy cuts both ways and that children of out-of-work parents may be pressured to quit school and seek work. Still others, like Dr. Diane Ravitch, the assistant United States Secretary of Education for research, believe that school-age youngsters are learning that, recession or not, "there are not many good jobs for uneducated people."
In announcing the results of the survey, Mr. Fernandez took pains to cite some of the programs he has pioneered, particularly his overhaul of an expensive dropout program started by his predecessors that had been described as a costly failure in an evaluation by a professor at Teachers College at Columbia University.
The Chancellor also took the occasion to point out that the members of last year's graduating class were still the beneficiaries of the more generous budgets of ther 1980's, before the current round of budget cuts.
The Board of Education's dropout figures have long been the subject of controversy. Before 1986, the four-year figures were mathematical extrapolations based on the annual dropout rate, and some observers felt that they were subject to manipulation for public consumption. In 1986, the board began actually tracking all ninth graders and following these "cohorts" to their expected graduation date and three years beyond.

HEADLINE: ENVIRONMENT LAWS ARE EASED BY BUSH AS ELECTION NEARS

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 19

 BODY:
As the recession hangs on and the election nears, the Bush Administration has followed a pattern of altering environmental laws and regulations to open more Federal land and the nation's natural resources to development, top Administration officials say.
The pattern emerged last summer, when the White House proposed eliminating restrictions on building and development on half the nation's wetlands. Since then the Administration has fostered a flurry of new proposals to make more of the nation's coal, timber, oil, water and land available to industry and agriculture. 
 Administration officials say the effort to open natural resources has been aided by President Bush's four-month-old regulatory moratorium in which existing environmental rules are under review and others are being rewritten to reduce their cost to business.
 
Philosophy and Politics
 Together, the two policies represent the strongest effort to reduce environmental restrictions since the early days of the Reagan Administration, White House officials and critics of the President say.
In public statements and private conversation, Bush Administration officials say the pattern reflects both the philosophical effect of the President's Council on Competitiveness, which is headed by Vice President Dan Quayle, and concern over carrying Western states in the election this fall.
The general thrust of both forces has been to shift the balance toward economic concerns instead of the conservationism favored by the main environmental groups.
"The President has always been in favor of protecting the environment in a way that is compatible with growth," David M. McIntosh, the executive director of the President's Council on Competitiveness, said Monday. "What you are seeing is a series of decisions that focused on the economic growth side of the balance. Perhaps what is going on is a shift in emphasis."
Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. said anti-environmental sentiment among some Western voters also played a role. In the Reagan years these sentiments fueled a movement called the "sagebrush rebellion," which put pressure on the Interior Department to open more Federal land for mining, grazing and logging.
Secretary Lujan has alerted the White House that members of the old rebellion have joined with private landowners, the timber industry, coal companies and others who rely on natural resources to form a new coalition that calls itself the "wise use" movement.
 
Conservative Constituency
 Mr. Lujan says the Administration should address the movement's agenda to improve its standing with its natural conservative constituency and should not worry so much about sentiment of environmentalists who, he believes, will not support Mr. Bush under any circumstances.
"I have never seen a positive reaction from environmental groups no matter what we do," the Secretary said. "I don't ever expect a positive reaction."
In an interview Saturday, Mr. Lujan, who served from 1969 to 1989 as a Congressman from New Mexico, said he was bringing "the plight of the Western constituency to the White House," and added: "People who live in the West look at the land in a different way than people east of the Mississippi River. Land is our heritage to use and not just lock up and put away, where only backpackers can go. I have been telling the White House staff that our constituency, the conservative Republican constituency, is not pleased at being ignored."
A number of officials agree with Mr. Lujan that the White House is driven by fears that the traditional Republican Party support in the eight Rocky Mountain states, which have a total of 40 electoral votes, is eroding. The White House is also following a plan devised by Senator Slade Gorton, a Republican from Washington state, to recapture Oregon and Washington, the only two Western states Mr. Bush lost in the 1988 election.
Thus, the President's strategy is meant to shore up support among the timber, mining, coal and agricultural groups that anchor the "wise use" movement. Leaders of the movement are pressing for a loosening of policies that they see as brakes on the economy. They also want to protect jobs and families by providing resources that some of the nation's largest industries need to operate.
Last week, in the clearest signs yet that Mr. Bush is taking account of industrial interests in weighing environmental protections, a Cabinet-level committee voted to exempt the Government from the Endangered Species Act and allow the cutting of 1,700 acres of forest in Oregon that provide habitat for the threatened northern spotted owl. Secretary Lujan also proposed legislation that, if approved, would rewrite the basis of the Endangered Species Act by introducing economic considerations, like the loss of jobs, when deciding if a rare species deserved Federal protection.
 
Air Pollution Curbs Relaxed
 The President also decided last week to allow companies to increase toxic air pollution above levels authorized on their operating permits without notifying the public. William K. Reilly, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, had argued for months that the Clean Air Act of 1990 required such increases to be subject to public review. In taking the action, Mr. Bush sided with his Vice President, who said that long public reviews would delay worthwhile changes in manufacturing and might cause companies to move their plants overseas.
Environmental leaders in Congress said they would fight the Administration's actions. Representative Henry A. Waxman, a California Democrat who is a co-author of the Clean Air Act, has filed a lawsuit contending that the President's decision to allow companies to increase emissions of pollution without notifying the public was "a knowingly illegal act."
Mr. Waxman, who is chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health and the Environment, has scheduled a hearing on the issue, to be held Friday. "This is extremely troubling," he said in a statement Sunday about Mr. Bush's decision. "The notion that the President cannot change the law on his own, regardless of what big business wants, is basic to our democratic process."
Other actions the White House has taken to ease environmental restrictions and open resources to industry have been made quietly. They include new rules at the Interior Department and the Agriculture Department to eliminate the ability of the public to appeal and block timber harvests, mining, oil drilling, grazing and other uses of public land.
The Interior Department has also proposed a separate rule to make it easier for coal companies to strip mine Federal forest land in the East and grazing land in the West. And as the centerpiece of the President's energy policy, the White House wants to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to oil exploration.
Privately, some influential Administration officials agree with their critics that the new policy directives are a sharp departure from Mr. Bush's first year in office, when he proclaimed himself the "environmental President" and appointed Mr. Reilly, a leading conservationist, to direct the environmental agency.
 
Rewriting the Rules
 Perhaps the most important change in environmental regulations that the Administration has proposed so far is rewriting rules to limit or eliminate the public's ability to intervene in corporate or government decisions.
In March, Mr. Lujan eliminated the public's decades-old ability to appeal decisions by the Interior Department and to block oil exploration licenses, grazing permits, mining leases and other industrial uses of public lands.
Mr. Lujan said in the interview that useful projects on public lands were being delayed indefinitely by opponents who did nothing more than mail in criticisms, automatically initiating long reviews of the agency's decisions. "It was the 29-cent appeal," he said. "A letter stopped everything. Now if they want to appeal, they go to court."
A month later, Agriculture Secretary Edward Madigan used the same rationale as the basis for proposing to eliminate an 85-year-old rule that gave the public the right to appeal decisions by the United States Forest Service and to block sales of timber on Federal land.
"What you see is an understanding by the President that in a recession there is an increased sensitivity to the job side of the equation," Michael R. Deland, the chairman of the President's Council on Environmental Quality, said today. "The President has an understanding and empathy for folks out of work. He doesn't want to see additional people put out of work by a rule that does not effectively protect public health and the environment."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE RIOTS;
QUAYLE SAYS RIOTS SPRANG FROM LACK OF FAMILY VALUES

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, May 19

 BODY:
In a direct appeal to the Republican conservative base two weeks before the California Presidential primary, Vice President Dan Quayle said today that the Los Angeles riots were the result of a "poverty of values" in the inner cities and that the nation should show no sympathy to those who joined in the civil unrest.
Seeking to shore up President Bush's support in the most populous state, and to lay groundwork for his own political future, Mr. Quayle appeared before the Commonwealth Club of California to deliver the sort of tub-thumping message that conservatives, including some of the Vice President's supporters, contend is lacking from Mr. Bush's oratory.
 
Transition to Middle Class?
 "I believe the lawless social anarchy which we saw is directly related to the breakdown of family structure, personal responsibility and social order in too many areas of our society," Mr. Quayle said in his first trip to California since the rioting, which left 58 dead and caused hundreds of millions of dollars in property damage. 
 He suggested that poverty was an inevitable part of society but should be a transition to the middle class, and that many of the urban poor remained that way because they had lost their moral fiber in the social and political upheaval of the 1960's and 1970's.
"Yes, I can understand how people were shocked and outraged by the verdict in the Rodney King trial," he told the group of business executives and professionals during at a lunch at the Hilton Hotel after touring a housing project in one of the city's worst neighborhoods.
 
'Simply No Excuse'
 "But, my friends, there is simply no excuse for the mayhem that followed. To apologize or in any way excuse what happened is wrong. It is a betrayal of all those people equally outraged and equally disadvantaged who did not loot, who did not riot." [Excerpts from the Vice President's speech appear on page A20.]
Although Mr. Quayle did not break with Bush Administration policy on urban affairs, his speech, which was warmly received, included much stronger and more intensely ideological language than the President himself has used. In his May 7 visit to Los Angeles, Mr. Bush condemned "wanton lawlessness" but he also said: "We are embarrassed by interracial violence and prejudice. We are ashamed. We should take nothing but sorrow out of all of that and do our level best to see that it's eliminated from the American dream."
In part, Mr. Quayle's words today seemed to reflect his role as the representative of the Republican right in an otherwise largely non-ideological White House. After weeks of confused and sometimes contradictory responses from the White House to the rioting in Los Angeles, Mr. Quayle was clearly reaching for traditional Republican roots and conservative themes.
He took a noticeably harder line than that of Jack F. Kemp, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, who has been more conciliatory than others in the Administration and critical of policies of the last 12 years. Mr. Kemp accompanied Mr. Bush to Los Angeles earlier in the month.
 
Wants Sense of Family
 Mr. Quayle said the Republican policies of the 1980's had helped produce a strong black middle class, suggested that a stronger sense of family was the cure to urban blight, crime and drugs, and derided those who have called for greater Federal spending in the aftermath of the violence in California following the acquittal of four white police officers in the beating of Mr. King, a black motorist.
"Instead of denouncing wrongdoing, some have shown tolerance for rioters; some have enjoyed saying, 'I told you so,' and some have simply made excuses for what happened," he said. "All of this has been accompanied by pleas for more money."
Mr. Quayle often takes more conservative public positions than the President and sometimes tries out political themes that Mr. Bush later takes up.
While Mr. Bush is assured of renomination, his conservative challenger, Patrick J. Buchanan, is running hard in California. The Bush campaign is eager for a strong showing in the June 2 primary because California is vital to the President's re-election prospects.
Mr. Quayle called for "social sanctions" against women who bear children out of marriage "irresponsibly" and at one point even lashed out against a popular television program, "Murphy Brown," in which the title character, a single woman played by Candice Bergen, bears a child.
"It doesn't help matters when prime-time TV has Murphy Brown -- a character who supposedly epitomizes today's intelligent, highly paid, professional woman -- mocking the importance of fathers, by bearing a child alone, and calling it just another 'life style choice.' "
But despite Mr. Quayle's ardent plea, there was an element of confusion in the Vice President's remarks during a three-day visit to California this week as the White House tries to show that it recognizes the need for change without breaking entirely with the policies that have kept Republicans in the White House for the last 11 years.
After his speech today, Mr. Quayle flew to Palm Springs, in Southern California, for a fund-raising event at the Desert Horizons Country Club.
On Monday, Mr. Quayle told a group of schoolchildren in Salinas, near Monterey, that the "trickle-down" theory, which was espoused by President Ronald Reagan, was "ridiculous," and that the Bush Administration wants to help impoverished Americans rise up through society.
Quayle aides quickly tried to pull back that statement, saying Mr. Quayle had not intended to give a blanket criticism of Mr. Reagan's policies. Today, he offered a strong defense of those programs, and repeated the Administration's attack on the Democratic programs of the 1960's.
"It would be overly simplistic to blame this social breakdown on the programs of the Great Society alone," Mr. Quayle said. "It would be absolutely wrong to blame it on the growth and success most Americans enjoyed during the 1980's. Rather, we are in large measure reaping the consequences of decades of changes in social mores."
Reminding his audience that his birth in 1947 made him a "baby-boomer," Mr. Quayle said, "Let's look at one unfortunate legacy of the 'boomer' generation. When we were young it was fashionable to declare war against traditional values. Indulgence and self-gratification seemed to have no consequences. Many of our generation glamorized casual sex and drug use, evaded responsibility and trashed authority."
He added: "Today the 'boomers' are middle-aged and middle class. The responsibility of having families has helped many recover traditional values. And, of course, the great majority of those in the middle class survived the turbulent legacy of the 60's and 70's. But many of the poor, with less to fall back on, did not."
Declaring that "unless we change the basic rules of society in our inner cities, we cannot expect anything else to change," Mr. Quayle said that "government's first obligation is to maintain order."
He called for tough measures against drug dealers and gangs and for "dismantling a welfare system that encourages dependency and subsidizes broken families."
"Ultimately, marriage is a moral issue that requires cultural consensus and the use of social sanctions," he said. "Bearing babies irresponsibly is, simply, wrong. Failing to support children one has fathered is wrong. We must be unequivocal about this."
As for Mr. Quayle's allusion to "Murphy Brown," the show's creator and longtime producer, Diane English, issued this statement from her Hollywood office: "If the Vice President thinks it's disgraceful for an unmarried woman to bear a child, and if he believes that a woman cannot adequately raise a child without a father, then he'd better makes sure abortion remains safe and legal."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Heading Off Heroin's Return

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
WHAT turned thousands of ordinarily law-abiding citizens of Los Angeles into looters? While the seeds of the Los Angeles riots were surely nurtured in the deep muck of poverty and racial rage, economists who study illicit markets suggest there is a lot to be learned about explosive changes in crime from mundane analysis of deterrence and opportunity. And the most striking explanation for such discontinuities is what Mark A. R. Kleiman of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government calls "enforcement swamping" -- the disequilibrium created when forces of deterrence are overwhelmed.
Once stated, the idea seems obvious: lawbreaking can have positive feedback effects, making it "cheaper" for others to join the fray. But obvious ideas can be profound. Mr. Kleiman, the author of a new book on drug policy, "Against Excess" (Basic Books), contends that enforcement swamping explains why the use of crack cocaine reached epidemic proportions in the 1980's in spite of the billions spent to fight it. And failure to learn from that failure, he argues, could lead to a heroin epidemic in the 1990's. 
 Some people stop at the checkout counter because it is the right thing to do. Some pay, though, only because the "price" of stealing, measured in the perceived risk of getting caught and punished, is higher than the price of acquiring goods with cash. One would thus expect small changes in the cash price, or the number of store guards, or the length of prison terms would lead to small changes in theft.
But suppose an increase in the "demand" for crime or a decrease in the "supply" of law enforcement leads more people to attempt economic crime. And the extra volume of crime reduces the probability of any single thief's getting caught, further reducing the price of stealing. Then the rate of lawbreaking will continue to grow until there is nothing of value left to steal, or the law enforcers finally throw enough resources at the problem to reverse the feedback mechanism.
Mr. Kleiman says that positive feedback works more circuitously, but just as effectively, in markets for illicit drugs. He maintains that the Government's initial failure to rate cocaine as a serious health threat in the late 1970's allowed the drug to gain a foothold among affluent consumers. Demand grew thereafter by what the Harvard economist calls "word of nose" -- and in the process, reduced the overhead costs of distribution.
Then, in 1981, the price of cocaine collapsed as competitors rushed into what had been a cozy little local business. Enforcement was swamped, further reducing the cost of delivering the goods and creating incentives for technological innovation. At $40 a hit, Mr. Kleiman notes, only high rollers could afford to freebase -- smoke -- cocaine. But at $5 for a rock of powerfully addicting crack cocaine, the stuff went out the door like Armani jackets at a pre-Christmas sale.
The use of cocaine in its various forms peaked in the mid-1980's and has fallen since. In part, that is because enforcement has had a chance to catch up: arrest and imprisonment rates for cocaine are at their highs. But since the street price is as low as ever, falling consumption must largely be due to falling demand for a drug now widely perceived as a ticket to psychosis.
There is no direct evidence that a similar cycle has begun in the long-dormant heroin market. But Mr. Kleiman believes that the conditions are right for a breakout. The street price of heroin has been eroding for several years. And in real terms it is now no higher than it was in the mid-1960's, on the eve of the last great boom in consumption.
Mr. Kleiman acknowledges that AIDS has reduced the attraction of injected drugs. But he notes that at the current low price, it is practical to get high on heroin by smoking it or snorting it. And if the drug does take off, it will be very hard to stop. Foreign sources are diverse. And interdiction technology, focused on planeload-sized shipments of cocaine from Latin America, will be almost useless in stopping imports of heroin by mail and courier.
Most troubling, perhaps, definitive evidence of escalating use will come only after the horse has left the barn. Cocaine addicts burn out fast; huge numbers of recruits are needed each year to sustain an epidemic. Heroin addicts, by contrast, are generally lifers; the annual turnover at just 5 percent. Thus a doubling of recruitment, which would eventually lead to a doubling of addicts, would barely show up in the early years.
The prudent course, Mr. Kleiman argues, would be to reshuffle drug deterrence resources now. While heroin interdiction is impractical, one could raise the street price by blitzing domestic distribution. And it might be possible to contain demand with education on the risks of snorting and smoking.
Drug law enforcement, Mr. Kleiman warns, is like a souffle: "Once it has fallen, no manipulation will cause it to rise again."

NEW YORK CITY
 
A NEW VISION FOR THE WEST SIDE
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and Mayor David N. Dinkins have agreed to create a joint agency to revive Manhattan's decrepit West Side waterfront, a potentially significant milestone in a project that has been stalled more than two decades. They envision a 40-acre ribbon of parkland straddled by a new highway from the Battery to 59th Street and three possible riverfront sites for commercial or residential development. A1.
 
A DECLINE IN DROPOUT RATES
New York City reported a significant decline in the number of students dropping out of high school. Board of Education officials said that years of hounding truants and pressing students to complete their courses were finally paying off. But they acknowledged that a sluggish economy, with diminished job prospects, might be partly responsible for the improvement. A1.
 
AN AIDS ACCORD, AND QUESTIONS 
 Rushing to heal political wounds in the Hispanic community, Mayor David N. Dinkins signed an agreement with the Mayor of San Juan that is intended to provide better access to AIDS care for Puerto Ricans who travel between New York City and their homeland. But advocates for people with AIDS immediately denounced the agreement, which does not provide for any financing or set any timetable for achieving its goals, as merely a publicity stunt. B3.
 
A RULING ON LANDMARKS
Peter S. Kalikow's plan to replace 4 of 14 historic tenements on the Upper East Side with an enormous apartment tower was blocked by a New York State appeals court. As significant as the impact is on Mr. Kalikow's project, the ruling could send an even broader signal: that landmark designations cannot be compromised for political reasons. B3.

FUZZY PICTURE ON CUTTING TAXES
Republicans swept to total dominance of the New Jersey Legislature because of voter anger over a 1990 tax increase. So the one thing that is clear is that the people of New Jersey want a tax cut, and anybody who stands in the way is committing political suicide. Right? Wrong. B6.
 
SHOWDOWN ON YONKERS' GARBAGE
With 200 tons of trash piled up along Yonkers streets, the Mayor has threatened sanitation with stiff fines in a test of wills between a new administration and the powerful Teamsters. B6.
 
AN ATTACK ON 'ONE-SHOTS'
Renewing the debate over one of New York State's most controversial fiscal practices, the State Comptroller, Edward V. Regan, charged that the level of "one-shot" financing in the state budget adopted last month was much higher than the estimates provided by Governor Cuomo. B4.
 
'ALTERNATIVES TO PRISON'
A Long Island criminal-justice professor who taught a course on "alternatives to prison" has confessed to helping two inmates escape from prison in upstate New York last week, the state police said. The two, serving time for murder and armed robbery, remain at large. B6.

HEADLINE: Drivers to Vote on Contract That Would Reduce Staffing

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL

 BODY:
Newspaper delivery drivers are scheduled to vote tomorrow on new contracts that would sharply reduce their numbers over several years and introduce other economies in exchange for job guarantees, retirement bonuses and other incentives.
The latest version of the contracts with The New York Times and a distributor would for the first time permit part-time workers as drivers, something long opposed by the union, which has insisted on full-time wages no matter how many hours are worked. 
 But the new contracts would set a lower percentage of part-time drivers than contracts that the union rejected earlier this month. The new contracts also contain provisions that could put off the hiring of part-time drivers for years.
The contracts, which could spell labor peace or war in the city's newspaper industry for years to come, would also make it easier for drivers to advance to positions that guarantee more hours and would maintain standard grievance procedures for drivers who have complaints about working conditions.
But the contract provisions most onerous to many drivers would remain. Company managers would get the right to designate delivery routes and even order freight other than newspapers to be carried on the trucks. Trucks would be larger and newspaper bundles heavier. Foremen would be taken out of the union and made management representatives. And overtime would not be granted as a routine part of the schedule, cutting many drivers' incomes to $40,000 from the current $80,000.
 
Members Briefed Tonight
 In preparation for tomorrow's vote, members of the 2,900-strong Newspaper and Mail Deliverers' Union of New York and Vicinity will be briefed at a membership meeting tonight in Manhattan on the settlement being proposed to end the bitter two-week labor dispute.
Earlier versions of the contracts were rejected on May 6 by 57 percent of the 1,600 union members voting.
None of the leadership of the parties involved in the negotiations -- the union's president, Douglas LaChance; officials of The Times, or the wholesaler, Arthur E. Imperatore of Imperial Delivery Service -- would publicly discuss the latest contracts or assess their prospects for passage. But some union members provided details about the major provisions.
And other union members said that while dissatisfaction with the contracts remained widespread, there was little alternative to approval.
 
Changes Called 'Minor'
 Anthony B. Laino, a shop steward for drivers at the Newspaper Distributors Company in East Farmingdale, L.I., one of two companies whose union contracts were voided when Mr. Imperatore purchased the company's assets, called the contract changes "minor" and "garbage," but said he would urge his members to vote for them anyway.
"I'm going to tell them, 'Listen, we have to take it because we have no support,' " he said Monday outside the distribution center. He said he was persuaded of this when Barry Feinstein, a teamsters' union leader and one of three intermediaries who helped arrange talks that led to the proposed settlement last weekend, warned publicly that rejection by the membership would be "the road to hell."
After a week of calm while talks proceeded, The Times yesterday reported two "isolated" incidents of vandalism, the attempted firebombing of a delivery truck early yesterday on Interstate 95 en route to Mr. Imperatore's other distribution center, Westfair Newspaper Distributors in New Rochelle, and the slashing of three conveyor belts at the paper's West 43d Street plant. Neither disrupted production or delivery, said a Times spokeswoman, Nancy Nielsen.
In addition to drivers at Mr. Imperatore's distribution centers, the proposed contracts would cover nearly 1,000 drivers who will initially deliver The Times out of the newspaper's $450 million plant in Edison, N.J., and drivers for two wholesale distribution centers whose assets are to be acquired by The Times.
On May 6 the drivers voted on five contracts. Two covered Westfair and Newspaper Distributors, which had been acquired by Imperial Delivery; two covered the prospective Times acquisitions, Metropolitan News Company and Newark Newsdealers Supply. Because all four companies had been sold as assets, their labor contracts lapsed with the sale and had to be renegotiated. The fifth contract was for the Edison plant, which, as a new workplace, required a new contract.
For tomorrow's vote, Mr. Imperatore's two contracts have been combined as one, so four are on the table.
The contracts run through the year 2000, with a provision to reopen negotiations on wages after three years. Salary increases in the new contracts are actually lower in the new contracts than in the contracts that were rejected. In exchange for increasing welfare and pension benefits for some drivers, the proposed contracts set the increase at $32 a week in the first year, $31 in the second and $31 in the third. The earlier contracts had called for raises of $34 in the first year, then $32 and $32.
In the current complex hierarchy of drivers, there are almost 1,000 employees called "permanent situation holders" who are guaranteed regular work at The Times and at the four wholesalers. The wholesalers receive papers from The Times's printing plants and deliver them to news dealers and home-delivery services.
In addition to those 1,000 employees, there are another 250 or so workers called Group 1 drivers, who are the first called to fill in when regular drivers retire or are absent.
Under staffing levels in the proposed settlement, the number of permanent drivers at Mr. Imperatore's distribution centers would be allowed to shrink through attrition to 126 from the current 210; at The Times's centers the numbers would shrink to about 230 from about 370.
The number of permanent Times drivers would be frozen at the current level of 370 until all The Times's Group 1 drivers advanced to permanent status. Then the number of permanent drivers could shrink to 270.
Over time, the total number of permanent drivers for The Times and the wholesalers would drop to under 700, saving The Times alone, according to one union member's calculations, at least $30 million a year.
Retirements would be hastened by one-time departure bonuses of $75,000 for permanent Times drivers and $35,000 for Group 1 Times drivers, and $35,000 for both groups of drivers at any of the four distribution centers.
All Group 1 drivers would get their welfare and pension benefits paid by management. To achieve this provision in the contracts, the union agreed to reduce its wage increase.
The contracts that were rejected on May 6 set the number of part-time drivers at 15 percent of the total regular shifts. Under the proposed settlement, that number would be reduced to 10 percent.
In the latest proposal, The Times and Mr. Imperatore dropped efforts to institute a more cumbersome multistep procedure for workers to file job grievances, instead maintaining standard newspaper industry procedures.

HEADLINE: Bosnian, in U.S. to Seek Aid, Assails Inaction

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 19

 BODY:
In an impassioned plea for armed intervention to save the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina from starvation and slaughter, the country's Foreign Minister said here today that the world's inaction was a "disgrace for humanity."
The Foreign Minister, Haris Silajdzic, said the world was standing on the sidelines as it had done in the face of Nazi atrocities in the 1930's. 
 Speaking at a sparsely attended news conference -- he had been told, he said, that there wasn't much American interest in the war for Bosnia -- he described in vivid terms the plight of the newly independent republic, now under siege by Serbian forces.
Later today, a State Department official said that what was going on in Bosnia was "a very dirty war" but repeated the Administration position that the use of military force had been rejected "for very good reason." He said military intervention would be difficult because much of the fighting was going on among irregulars and foreign forces would get bogged down.
That left only economic and political measures to use against the Serbians, the department official said, warning that it could take "six months or a year" to resolve the conflict.
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, who instigated the attacks on Bosnia, was an uncompromising nationalist. "The only thing the man understands is power," he said.
Mr. Silajdzic said that Bosnian towns and cities were undergoing "ethnic cleansing" under Serbian guns and that whole neighborhoods of non-Serbs were being herded into what he called concentration camps.
All Yugoslav Army forces should be withdrawn, he said, and foreign troops should be brought in to take control of artillery and other weapons of war.
"My country has turned into a slaughterhouse," Mr. Silajdzic said. "Our people are suffering terribly. Millions are threatened with starvation, lack of medicine and clean water."
Mr. Silajdzic has been trying for several weeks to persuade a reluctant international community to send peacekeeping troops to halt the fighting in Bosnia.
After a visit to Washington by Mr. Silajdzic in April, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d gave several strongly worded warnings to Belgrade. But on this trip, the State Department said no meetings between Mr. Baker and Mr. Silajdzic had been planned.
More than 1,300 people have been killed in fighting since March when Bosnia and Herzegovina -- or at least its Croats and Muslims -- voted for independence from Yugoslavia. Large numbers of the ethnic Serbian minority opposed the move.
When the European Community and the United States recognized Bosnian independence, the Serb-dominated Yugoslav Army intervened.
The Foreign Minister told reporters today that the conflict was not an ethnic war. He said it was purely an attack by Serbia and Montenegro, the remaining republics of Yugoslavia, "with the Yugoslav Army instrumental in the aggression."

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Fighting Rages in Bosnia
 BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, May 19 (AP) -- Fighting raged across Bosnia and Herzegovina today despite a truce, driving thousands more from their homes.
Russia's Foreign Minister, Andrei Kozyrev, met President Milosevic in Belgrade and said he had a plan for a peace settlement.
"After my visit to all the former Yugoslav republics, we may formulate a new initiative to resolve the Yugoslav crisis," he said.
But the Organization of the Islamic Conference called on its 46 member nations to recall their ambassadors from Belgrade.
And the International Red Cross said today that Frederic Maurice, 39 years old, who was to have headed the group's Sarajevo mission, died today of wounds he had suffered in an attack on Monday on a Red Cross convoy heading into Sarajevo.

HEADLINE: JAPANESE DECLINE TO CONDEMN ARMY

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 19

 BODY:
The Japanese Government, by far Thailand's largest source of foreign aid and a major influence in economic growth, said today that it would not press the country's leadership to stop the crackdown on anti-Government protesters.
The country's chief Cabinet secretary, Koichi Kato, said only, "We hope order is quickly restored." 
 Japan's mild comments, and its seeming embrace of the military Government, seemed to underscore the somewhat divergent approaches taken by Washington and Tokyo since since military leaders in Thailand, led by Suchinda Kraprayoon, took power in a coup last year.
At the time the United States cut off all assistance except for funds to fight drug trafficking. But Japan, which provides more than three-quarters of Thailand's foreign aid -- about $418 million last year -- restored its aid after only a brief pause and never strongly condemned the coup.
"We regard the Suchinda Government as a legitimate, constitutional government," a senior official of Japan's Foreign Ministry said today. "It is regrettable that blood has been shed, but there was an attack on the enforcement authorities that provoked it."
Government officials denied that business interests were playing any role in its gingerly treatment of Thailand's actions, which included the shooting of scores of protesters.
But Bangkok is ringed by Toyota automobile plants and a range of Japanese-owned electronics factories that make everything from computer chips to microwave ovens. Japanese cars account for over 90 percent of those on the road in Thailand. Prolonged political instability could have serious consequences for productivity on the factory floor.
 
Tolerant of Crackdowns
 In a statement late today, the Japanese Government said that it hoped "the situation will be settled promptly and peacefully" and that it would "monitor future developments, including the parliamentary deliberations on constitutional amendments" that would require that the Prime Minister be an elected official. But it avoided any condemnation of the shootings.
In many ways, Japan's tepid reaction seemed to echo its response in other cases when pro-democracy demonstrators and authoritarian governments have come into conflict. Japanese officials often argue that stable government and economic growth are preconditions for democracy.
With that logic, Japan was among the first countries to renew ties with China after the crackdown in Tiananmen Square in 1989. The previous year, Tokyo declined to cut off all aid to Myanmar after Government troops there killed hundreds of protesters. It continues to finance what it terms humanitarian projects, and Japanese trading companies are once again active in the country.
Several weeks ago, when President Alberto K. Fujimori of Peru suspended the constitution and dissolved parliament, Japan also declined to join the United States in condemning the actions or cutting off aid.

HEADLINE: Administration Must Decide On LTV Unit's Sale to French

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 19

 BODY:
The Bush Administration must decide soon whether to permit a French concern to buy a leading American military supplier, a landmark decision that has important consequences for American national security, global competitiveness and thousands of jobs.
At issue is the $300 million sale of the LTV Corporation's missile division to France's Thomson-CSF, one of the world's largest military companies. 
 Supporters of the proposed deal say Thomson's deep pockets -- the French Government controls 58 percent of the company -- would give LTV a strong international marketing network and save jobs at the Dallas-based missile maker.
But many in Congress and the aerospace industry fear the sale will compromise American military technology and weaken the global competitiveness of American companies.
In House and Senate hearings last week, lawmakers voiced sharp skepticism that Congress could trust France and French companies, which have been among the most active arms merchants to countries like Libya, Iran and Iraq. In the Persian Gulf war, Allied forces confronted radar made by Thomson and other French equipment.
LTV's missile division makes missile and artillery systems for the Army, as well as Erint, a hit-to-kill missile that is an important part of the Strategic Defense Initiative plan for battlefield defenses against ballistic missiles.
A high-stakes battle is unfolding here as the team of losing bidders, the Martin Marietta Corporation and the Lockheed Corporation, appeals to lawmakers and to an interagency Administration committee. The sale cannot go forward until it has been reviewed by the panel, which will submit its recommendation to Mr. Bush, who makes the final ruling.
The Administration, normally a strong backer of free trade and open markets, has adopted a neutral position on the sale until a 90-day review period ends in late July. The decision rests with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which is made up of officials from the Treasury, Defense, State, Commerce and Justice Departments, as well as the White House Office of Management and Budget, the Council of Economic Advisers and the United States trade representative.
A senior Administration official said today that the panel's 30-day preliminary review of the case, which expires on Wednesday, would be broadened to a more comprehensive 45-day examination.
Important members of the House of Representatives and more than half the Senate have challenged the Thomson purchase.
 
'A Dangerous Precedent'
 "This deal, if approved, would set a dangerous precedent by allowing foreign governments to compete with U.S. investors trying to buy ailing U.S. defense firms as that industry shrinks and consolidates," said Senator Robert C. Byrd, the West Virginia Democrat who heads the Appropriations Committee.
Mr. Byrd and Senator Lloyd Bentsen, Democrat of Texas, introduced legislation last week that would halt the sale.
Of the 700 filings submitted to the panel since it was formed by the Exon-Florio Act four years ago, the White House has rejected only one sale, a Chinese proposed takeover of Mamco Inc., a Seattle-based aerospace company.
Senior Administration officials, including Deputy Defense Secretary Donald J. Atwood, have said the sale may be approved if the Government and Thomson can agree on special security restrictions to protect classified military secrets from falling into hostile hands.
 
How Much Secret Work
 Thomson says only about 5 percent of LTV's business is highly classified, but Chester Paul Beach Jr., the Defense Department's acting general counsel, said at a Senate hearing earlier this month that about 75 percent of the missile contracts involve some components that require special security clearances.
Under the Pentagon's interpretation, Thomson-CSF would have to relinquish day-to-day control of the company, which Thomson executives have opposed.
At a hearing of the House Armed Services Committee last week, Representative Larry Hopkins, Republican of Kentucky, cited a classified Defense Department intelligence assessment that rated the Thomson deal as the highest national security risk of about 200 cases the Pentagon has reviewed in the last four years.
Industry officials say the case could also set an important precedent for future sales of American contractors abroad. "The reality is the industry is integrating across national borders, and American companies are among the last to recognize that they can't survive in the U.S. market alone," said Gordon Adams, director of the Defense Budget Project, an independent research organization here.
 
Bankruptcy Court Approval
 LTV signed a definitive agreement with Thomson-CSF and the Carlyle Group, a Washington-based investment company, on April 22. Under the terms of the deal, which was approved by Judge Burton R. Lifland of the Federal Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan, the French company would pay $300 million for the missile division, and Carlyle would pay $150 million for the aircraft unit. The Carlyle deal is not in dispute.
Foreign-policy issues are also being raised. Thomson and Carlyle officials say that if the sale is blocked for what are perceived to be protectionist reasons, relations with Paris and the European Community could be damaged.
Norman R. Augustine, Martin Marietta's chairman, said he did not oppose investments by privately owned foreign companies in American military contractors, but he did object to companies controlled by foreign governments.
 
Tough Foreign Competition
 "Is U.S. government going to signal to the world that even its major defense contractors are for sale to foreign governments at the highest bidder?" Mr. Augustine asked. "No company can successfully compete with a foreign government."
Carlyle's vice chairman, Frank C. Carlucci, a former Secretary of Defense, retorted, "Surely no one thinks that the French Government is sitting back plotting to take over the American defense industry."
LTV has been in bankruptcy since 1986. Most of the money raised from the auction of its once-prized aerospace and missile units would go to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation as payments for three LTV steelworker pensions that require an additional $3.1 billion in financing.

HEADLINE: Tarnished Rainbow;
Under the Stars, a Bitter Strike

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO

 BODY:
Susan Grymes stood before 30 Rockefeller Center and faced a dilemma. Next to her, two dozen strikers called to her, sometimes plaintively, sometimes angrily, not to go in. Above her, 65 floors to be exact, the panoramic views, the ballroom in the clouds, the elegant 1930's decor, the spicy salmon tartare -- in short, the Rainbow Room -- called to her to come up.
She paused to glance at a union flier, then forged through the revolving doors, her husband and two friends in tow, grimacing under a barrage of chants, whistles and catcalls from the strikers. 
 "I feel badly for those people, I do," Ms. Grymes, a New Jersey resident, said. "But this is my fifth anniversary and I've been waiting so long to do this."
 
Signs of Strife
 A strike has come to the Rainbow Room, and suddenly the cool pastel of its Art Deco veneer has cracked, exposing labor strife inside.
Last Thursday, workers at the Rainbow Room walked off the job to protest stalled contract negotiations with the B.E. Rock Corporation, the Rainbow Room's owner. They say more than 200 of the restaurant's 325 workers are striking. Management, which has hired about 80 replacement workers, says about 150 people are on strike.
In December, the workers, who did not belong to a union at the time, elected Local 6 of the Hotel and Restaurant Employees International Union as their collective bargaining agent amid complaints that management was reducing health benefits, taking a percentage of tips and laying off workers. The union says that three workers have been fired for union organizing. The Rainbow Room denies the charges and is appealing the certification of the union to the National Labor Relations Board in Washington.
 
Disagreement on Discord
 The talks reached an impasse a week ago, after about 15 negotiating sessions, with the two sides separated by what the union says is about $250,000 in wages and benefits, but management says is closer to $700,000 per year.
Rainbow Room officials say that the pickets have had little effect on business and that the restaurant's grill, cafe, banquet rooms and main dining room have been serving about 1,000 customers a night, about average.
But a prolonged battle could delay the restaurant's slow climb out of the recession, management concedes. A bitter strike in 1989 at Tavern on the Green cut business by as much as 60 percent during the 10 weeks it took to resolve the dispute.
 
Cancellations Mount
 This week, the Ms. Foundation and the Exxon Corporation canceled banquets because of the pickets, and more cancellations are expected. The union has also vowed to disrupt business through the potentially lucrative Democratic National Convention, which begins on July 13, if the strike continues that long.
"Democratic officials have assured us they won't cross picket lines," said John Turchiano, a spokesman for the union. "I don't know if it will go that long, but the workers are prepared for it."
Frederic N. Richman, a lawyer for the restaurant, said that if the strike lasts through the convention, "Everyone loses. "
No contract negotiations have been scheduled, and the two sides do not even agree on what they are disagreeing about. Management says the strike is over economic issues. It says Rainbow Room waiters and bartenders earn an average of $50,000 a year, and would make more if they accepted management's offer. Meeting the union's demands would be "like asking Joe Baum to commit economic suicide," he said, referring to one of the owners of the restaurant.
 
Other Divisive Issues
 But the union says it is striking to protest the firing of the three union organizers and management's refusal to sign a contract. It says that few waiters earn over $50,000 and that Rainbow Room employees earn less in base pay than workers at comparable restaurants. The dispute is not just about wages and benefits, but also about safety conditions and scheduling, union leaders say.
In dozens of interviews, striking workers -- many hired just after the restaurant completed a $25 million restoration in 1987 -- said they elected Local 6 to be their bargaining agent because management had begun reducing health benefits and laying off workers.
Waiters, bartenders and hat checkers said management systematically takes a portion, and sometimes all, of their tips. And many complained that they were expected to work 18-hour days during busy seasons, a practice they said would be stopped under a union contract.
Mr. Richman, the lawyer, said the Rainbow Room is "prepared to rehire the strikers, but is not obligated to do so." But some workers said they fear permanently losing their jobs, though they said believed the risk was warranted.
"It was that impossible," said Mitchell Conrad, a waiter. "It was either change the place or leave it."
Peter Ward, the executive vice president for Local 6, said, "Management is counting on people to ignore the picket line. But I think they are in for a rude awakening."
But on a recent evening, the pickets deterred few diners.
Dr. Mervyn Peskin and his wife, Leah, arriving for her father's birthday party, were greeted at the East 49th Street entrance to Rockefeller Center, by two strikers dressed in tuxedos who offered fliers promising "VIP service" at Tavern on the Green.
"They were very reasonable," said Dr. Peskin, of Westchester. "I don't know enough about the issues to take a side, but you can see from their faces that they are hurt and angry."
Inside the lobby of 30 Rockefeller Plaza, Mrs. Peskin argued that the union's grievances "are probably legitimate," a pronouncement her husband questioned.
But with differences unresolved, they stepped toward the elevator to the revolving dance floor in the sky. "I'm upset about this," said Mrs. Peskin. "But it's my father's 70th birthday and this is his favorite place. It's so New York."

HEADLINE: Alabama Senate Bars Vote on School Aid Plan

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, May 19

 BODY:
A $410 million package of tax increases and education reforms that were being considered by the Alabama Legislature died late Monday night when the State Senate refused to bring the measures to a vote.
Advocates of the proposed legislation said that outright opposition to tax increases and the pressure of considering the tax package, budget measures and other bills on the last day of the regular legislative session had combined to derail the proposal. 
 Legislative approval of the package would have sent the tax increases to a statewide referendum in August, just before the 750,000 children who attend public schools in Alabama are scheduled to begin the 1992-93 school year.
Some of the state's 129 school districts have said that without new taxes and the revenue they would generate they will not be able to open schools on time this year. For the past two years the state's schools and other government agencies have operated on austerity budgets as tax revenue declined.
"Alabama's future is in question," said Philip E. Austin, chancellor of the University of Alabama system who is a member of a study group that recommended the package.
The legislation and proposed tax increase was fashioned and refashioned over the last seven months as the study group, appointed by Gov. Guy Hunt, and a handful of legislators sought ways to meet the rising cost of education and make up for revenue losses caused by the recession.
 
Rise in Property Taxes
 Besides increasing state taxes, the measure would have forced local officials to increase the amount of money they raise from property taxes for education. Alabama ranks 48th in the nation in local spending for education.
Peck Fox, a spokesman for Lieut. Gov. Jim Folsom Jr., said that a number of the 35 state senators simply opposed any tax increase, while others believed that the proposed legislation would not change education practices in the state enough to warrant a tax increase.
"It was a noble effort," said James Campbell, the House Speaker pro tem, who supported the measure. "But I'm afraid tax and education reform won't be addressed again until the next session of the Legislature, beginning next February."
In a news conference today Governor Hunt, a Republican, confirmed that he would not call a special session of the Legislature in an effort to revive the tax increase and education reform package this year.

HEADLINE: Congress Seeks $1 Billion for Helping Those Hurt in Military Spending Cuts

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 19

 BODY:
In a largely symbolic effort to soften the blow of declining military spending, Congress is drawing up plans to set aside $1 billion in the Pentagon's budget next year to help communities, displaced military personnel and workers at weapon factories.
Supporters of the plans concede that $1 billion in a military budget of more than $275 billion will put only a dent in the problem. But proponents say the spending could be matched with state and local funds and used in proven programs adopted by private businesses. 
 The programs under review aim to promote high-tech companies that could absorb displaced workers, retrain former military personnel for new jobs in an industry that is prospering and cushion the economic dislocation in communities. If the programs prove successful in the first year, lawmakers said, financing could be increased.
The Congressional plan is the latest effort by lawmakers to counter growing political fears that cutting Pentagon spending too deeply could worsen job losses in the arms industry in a recessionary election year.
 
Hard-Hit Regions
 Although no one is certain what the economic effect will be from the $50 billion in military budget cuts that the Pentagon has proposed from 1992 through 1997, lawmakers are reacting to concerns that the savings will seriously harm some areas of the country. The aerospace industries in Southern California and Texas and big shipyards in Rhode Island and Connecticut could be especially hurt.
As a sign of this concern, Congress is considering whether to restore financing for one or two Seawolf submarines, assembled in Groton, Conn., that the Bush Administration wants to cancel.
Democrats in Congress have drawn up the most detailed plans for the conversion of industries from military to civilian uses. In a Presidential election year, these efforts have a secondary partisan goal: to pressure the Bush Administration to match their plans or face accusations of ignoring the plight of thousands of former military personnel and workers in the arms industry.
The Administration has not offered any sweeping proposals to cushion the effect of Pentagon budget cuts since the Soviet Union's collapse. And the Pentagon has resisted getting involved in the conversion.
 
Opposition at Pentagon
 "We fundamentally disagree with the concept of using Defense appropriations for domestic programs," Christopher Jehn, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Force Management and Personnel, wrote in a letter to Senator Claiborne Pell, a Rhode Island Democrat who heads the Labor subcommittee on education.
The Pentagon's main effort so far has been to designate $200 million from legislation Congress approved two years ago to help retrain and find jobs for employees of military contractors who have been laid off and for communities affected by base closings.
The Defense Department's tiny Office of Economic Adjustment gives grants of $200,000 to $300,000 to communities to help redesign their economies after a base or arms plant closes.
The House will consider the conversion plan in the first week of June, when it takes up the military budget bill for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. The Senate will consider its plan at the end of June, as part of its version of the military budget bill. Leading lawmakers say Congress will approve a version of the plans.
Under terms of the budget agreement that Congress and the Administration reached in 1990, the conversion programs under review must be military-related to use Pentagon money.
"Some of this is very innovative, but it's still dependent on the economy's recovery and overall Federal budget priorities," said Gordon Adams, director of the Defense Budget Project, an independent research organization.
Many of the proposals would expand existing programs run by the Departments of Labor and Commerce and other Federal agencies. In these cases, the Pentagon money would be transferred to the other agencies. Other programs involving partnerships with private industry would steer the Pentagon into areas the Government has historically left to free enterprise.
Under the conversion plans, the Pentagon would direct money to states, like New York and Connecticut, that have created diversification programs to help military contractors.
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York plans to testify before the House Armed Services Committee on Wednesday about a two-year-old, $10 million program in New York State that has helped about 100 military contractors obtain skills in commercial design, retrain workers and introduce modern production methods.
"In my experience, the most successful adjustments are where local bankers, business people and officials take charge," said Robert M. Rauner, who retired last month as the director of the Pentagon's Office of Economic Adjustment.
Democrats on the House Armed Services Committee are drafting a detailed plan that would provide grants to private high-tech companies, expand existing Pentagon partnerships with such companies and pay the salaries of displaced military personnel who teach mathematics or science in public schools.
 
Grants to Convert Plants
 Senator David Pryor of Arkansas is leading a group of 22 Democratic senators who advocate grants for small high-technology military companies that convert to make products with military and commercial uses.
Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who is chairman of the Armed Services Committee, has proposed allowing military personnel a year's leave to attend college or vocational school to prepare for civilian life, then provide increased retirement pay to those who go into fields like teaching and law enforcement.
Representative Bill Goodling, Republican of Pennsylvania, introduced legislation last week to increase financing to help retrain laid-off arms employees and find jobs for them.
Thirteen Republican senators, led by Senator Warren B. Rudman of New Hampshire, formed a committee last month to examine job retraining and community assistance.

HEADLINE: Bangkok Upheaval Follows Year of Friction

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 19

 BODY:
More than a year of political friction, constitutional debate and military maneuvering lay behind the confrontation that exploded on the streets of Bangkok over the last 10 days, pitting the Thai Army against thousands of unarmed civilians in Bangkok and other cities.
The crowds were demanding the resignation of an unelected Prime Minister, Suchinda Kraprayoon, a recently retired general. As supreme commander of the Thai armed forces, General Suchinda had plotted his way to power on a series of broken promises to restore a still-fragile democracy the army had abolished in February 1991. 
 In that month, a businessman-politician, Prime Minister Chatchai Choonhavan, was deposed in a bloodless military coup. Mr. Chatchai, whose Government was widely known to be corrupt, was nevertheless an elected leader and had been in office more than two years.
The post-coup period started out with promise. The generals named a respected former diplomat and civil servant, Anand Panyarachun, as interim Prime Minister and vowed that there would be a new election in a year. But first there would be a new constitution. Thailand has had 11 of them in half a century.
 
Effort to 'Raise Hopes'
 While an army-appointed commission was writing a constitution, Prime Minister Anand assembled a team of technocrats who took on the job of running the country with what critics acknowledged was a reasonably high level of efficiency.
The Prime Minister kept in touch with the constitution-writing process also, because there was apprehension among intellectuals and civilian politicans that the army was preparing a document that would institutionalize its political power.
Mr. Anand told the Far Eastern Economic Review in December 1991, after the document was completed, that he had intervened to reduce the powers the military intended to give to the appointed upper house of the Thai Parliament, called the Senate.
"What I wanted to do was raise hopes in people's minds that this was not a lost cause," he told the magazine.
 
Premier Forced to Resign
 But the final version of the constitution did not satisfy many Thais. Tensions began to rise by the end of last year, and the first democracy rallies began in November.
Throughout the year, competing generals and former generals had been positioning themselves for political careers. It seemed clear, many Thais said, that the military would insure that one of its number would emerge as head of government in elections set for March 22, 1992.
When the ballots were counted, no party emerged with a majority, forcing a coalition on a country already uncertain of the military's next moves. Generals had talked freely about controlling the "excesses" of politicians.
A pro-military civilian, Narong Wongwan, was named Prime Minister, but almost immeditely ran afoul of the United States. He had been denied an American visa in 1991 because there were questions about his family's involvement in the narcotics trade. He was forced to step down.
 
Dissident Ends Fast
 General Suchinda, still army commander and still protesting that he had no interest in politics, was soon "forced" by his military academy classmates -- each class becomes a lifelong fraternity in the Thai military -- to consider accepting the prime ministership.
He retired from the army and took the job, meaning that the restoration of Thai democracy was entrusted to an unelected head of government whose first allegiance remained to the army.
All that was needed to complete a combustible mixture was a leader who could serve as a focal point for the opposition. Chamlong Srimuang, a new member of Parliament and an extremely popular former governor of Bangkok, moved into the role. He began a fast in central Bangkok to back his demand for an elected prime minister, bringing out crowds of supporters.
Near death at the end of last week, Mr. Chamlong was persuaded to give up his fast, apparently by King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who has otherwise remained out of the present crisis.
But by then, the crowds had swelled into the hundreds of thousands and Thailand's largest democracy movement was rolling. Mr. Chamlong was arrested in the midst of the demonstrations, protesting that the violence around him was the work not of his followers but of provocateurs sent by the military.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE RIOTS;
Excerpts From Vice President's Speech on Cities and Poverty

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 19

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from remarks prepared for delivery by Vice President Dan Quayle before the Commonwealth Club of California, as transcribed by News Transcripts Inc. 
 I believe the lawless social anarchy which we saw is directly related to the breakdown of family structure, personal responsibility and social order in too many areas of our society. For the poor the situation is compounded by a welfare ethos that impedes individual efforts to move ahead in society, and hampers their ability to take advantage of the opportunities America offers.

 	 	 		. . .	 	There is no question that this country has had a terrible problem with race and racism. The evil of slavery has left a long legacy. But we have faced racism squarely, and we have made progress in the past quarter century. The landmark civil rights bills of the 1960's removed legal barriers to allow full participation by blacks in the economic, social and political life of the nation. By any measure the America of 1992 is more egalitarian, more integrated and offers more opportunities to black Americans and all other minority group members than the America of 1964. There is more to be done. But I think that all of us can be proud of our progress.

 	 	 		. . .	 	I was born in 1947, so I'm considered one of those "baby boomers" we keep reading about. But let's look at one unfortunate legacy of the boomer generation. When we were young, it was fashionable to declare war against traditional values. Indulgence and self-gratification seemed to have no consequences. Many of our generation glamorized casual sex and drug use, evaded responsibility and trashed authority.
Today the boomers are middle-aged and middle class. The responsibility of having families has helped many recover traditional values. And, of course, the great majority of those in the middle class survived the turbulent legacy of the 60's and 70's. But many of the poor, with less to fall back on, did not.
The intergenerational poverty that troubles us so much today is predominantly a poverty of values. Our inner cities are filled with children having children, with people who have not been able to take advantage of educational opportunities, with people who are dependent on drugs or the narcotic of welfare.

 	 	 		. . .	 	We are for law and order. If a single mother raising her children in the ghetto has to worry about drive-by shootings, drug deals or whether her children will join gangs and die violently, her difficult task becomes impossible. We're for law and order because we can't expect children to learn in dangerous schools. We're for law and order because if property isn't protected, who will build businesses?

 	 	 		. . .	 	Right now the failure of our families is hurting America deeply. When families fail, society fails. The anarchy and lack of structure in our inner cities are testament to how quickly civilization falls apart when the family foundation cracks.
Children need love and discipline. They need mothers and fathers. A welfare check is not a husband. The state is not a father. It is from parents that children learn how to behave in society; it is from parents above all that children come to understand values and themselves as men and women, mothers and fathers.
And for those concerned about children growing up in poverty, we should know this: Marriage is probably the best anti-poverty program of all. Among families headed by married couples today, there is a poverty rate of 5.7 percent. But 33.4 percent of families headed by a single mother are in poverty today.
Nature abhors a vacuum. When there are no mature, responsible men around to teach boys how to be good men, gangs serve in their place.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Answers to our problems won't be easy. We can start by dismantling a welfare system that encourages dependency and subsidizes broken families. We can attach conditions such as school attendance or work to welfare. We can limit the time a recipient gets benefits. We can stop penalizing marriage for welfare mothers. We can enforce child support payments.
Ultimately, however, marriage is a moral issue that requires cultural consensus, and the use of social sanctions. Bearing babies irresponsibly is, simply, wrong. Failing to support children one has fathered is wrong.
We must be unequivocal about this. It doesn't help matters when prime time TV has Murphy Brown -- a character who supposedly epitomizes today's intelligent, highly paid, professional woman -- mocking the importance of fathers by bearing a child alone and calling it just another "life style choice."
I know it is not fashionable to talk about moral values, but we need to do it. Even though our cultural leaders in Hollywood, network TV, the national newspapers routinely jeer at them, I think that most of us in this room know that some things are good, and other things are wrong.
Now it's time to make the discussion public. It's time to talk again about family, hard work, integrity and personal responsibility. We cannot be embarrassed out of our belief that two parents, married to each other, are better in most cases for children than one.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Democrats;
Clinton's Platform Gets Tryouts Before Friends

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBUQUERQUE, N.M., May 19

 BODY:
In the past 48 hours, Gov. Bill Clinton has talked to students in Oregon, gay and lesbian Democrats in Los Angeles and shipbuilders in San Diego. Just today, he hopscotched across four time zones, replenishing the fast-emptying coffers of his Presidential campaign.
The Clinton organization hoped to raise $1.5 million this week, the most of any single week during the Presidential race and enough to offset the borrowing the campaign has made against its expected receipt of Federal matching funds. 
 But more important for his long-term political prospects, Mr. Clinton has begun using these forums to try to stitch together the disparate pieces of his platform into a message that will recapture the television spotlight that has drifted away from him in the last few weeks.
Although he tries to play down the threat of Ross Perot's swiftly emerging candidacy, Mr. Clinton evidently knows he needs a message tailored to a three-way race in which the undeclared candidate seems to be nailing down the outsider role that Clinton strategists have long regarded as the key to the voters' fancy.
"Now I find that having won the Democratic nomination -- almost -- people are saying, 'I don't want to vote for that guy Clinton; he's just another politician,' " Mr. Clinton said at a San Diego County Democratic Party dinner earlier this week. He said Americans are suffering from a "profound disillusionment with politics."
"Let's go out and tell the American people the Democrats can be for political reform," he said. "We'll change what we've done wrong too. But we're going to bring growth back to this country."
 
Attacking Bush, Not Perot
 In this political equivalent of out-of-town theatrical tryouts, Mr. Clinton gets his most enthusiastic response when he aims barbs, which have become more pointed in recent days, at President Bush. He has not yet begun attacking Mr. Perot, but his associates say he is gearing up for that battle as well.
"A lot of what Perot says we were saying a year ago," said Paul Begala, one of Mr. Clinton's chief strategists and speechwriters. "The whole criticism of the political process, the criticism of Washington and the gridlock of both parties. I'll be damned if we're going to let Ross Perot hijack our message."
As he tries to revamp his message, Mr. Clinton has so far not presented many new policy proposals. He still speaks of "three little words" -- invest, cooperate and educate.
For the shipyard workers, Mr. Clinton advocated using the money from cuts in the Pentagon to help the military industry and its workers adapt to the needs of a peacetime economy.
"It doesn't work to say, 'Keep taxes low on corporations and be wealthy and get out of the way,' " Mr. Clinton said. "You've got to get your hands dirty, pull up your sleeves and do what it takes to compete and win with these other countries in he world. It is one of the biggest questions the American people face in this election."
At the fund-raising meeting sponsored by gay and lesbian advocates at a Hollywood club, Mr. Clinton pledged to step up AIDS research, lift the ban on homosexuals in the military and invite a person who has H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, to address the Democratic National Convention in New York in July.
"Over a million Americans are now H.I.V. positive," he told the crowd. "And yet the Administration is still curiously silent until the famous fall; until, like Magic Johnson, they come forward, or like Arthur Ashe, someone takes advantage of their privacy. Then someone says something appropriately touching."
And at a rally in downtown Albuquerque today, Mr. Clinton summed up his reformulated message by calling attention to the youngsters in the crowd.
"These children here in front should grow up in a peaceful, exciting and prosperous world," he said. "If you want that kind of world, we have to invest, cooperate and educate. We've got to be responsible as well as create more opportunities. And we've got to recreate a sense of community."
Since the Los Angeles riots, Mr. Clinton has tried to claim the high ground on matters of race relations, but he has not come through with sweeping urban-policy proposals of the sort that might underscore Mr. Bush's seeming passivity in responding to the disturbances.
"This country is being killed by people who are trying to break us down and tear us up and make us be little when we have to be big," Mr. Clinton said at the Hollywood fund-raising event.
 
California Awaits
 The big California primary is, oddly, almost an afterthought. Mr. Clinton does not plan to return to the state until May 27, five days before the primary.
"There's so much in the mix here with the Senate races and the House races," said Dee Dee Myers, a campaign spokeswoman who was dispatched to Los Angeles last week. "There's been a lot of clutter in the environment. But Californians tend to focus late. This happens every four years."
Before a receptive audience of San Diego Democrats, he delivered some of the most stinging gibes of the campaign as he predicted that the Republicans would use welfare to divide voters.
"I've watched the Republicans divide our country in election after election with the politics of division and denial and destruction," he said. "And they are good at it. They're better at it than we are. Let's 'fess up. We're not near as good as destroying people as they are."

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Gold Loses Its Appeal As a Haven

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
FORGET about gold as a haven. That is what thousands of investors did last year, as buying of gold for a secure investment declined sharply in Europe and North America.
And don't worry about the Russians. Their gold selling spooked the market for several years. But as a menace, they are receding. The new bogymen are government central bankers, whose gold selling could stifle any rally. 
 These are some of the main conclusions from the latest survey of the gold market by Gold Fields Minerals Services Inc. of London, perhaps the best-regarded source in the world, according to analysts, on the goings on in gold. These are some of the other thoughts from the report:
*Gold investors might worry a little about the Iraqis. They have sold about 50 tons of gold recently, most of it this year. Their sales have not had a significant impact on the gold market yet. But who knows?
*And watch the Chinese. At current rates China should soon overtake the United States as the world's largest gold market. The slow opening of the economy is creating wealth that is snapping up gold.
The annual report comes as the price of gold, which closed yesterday at $337.80 an ounce, down $1.10, on the New York Commodity Exchange, is at its lowest level since 1986, continuing a strong four-year downward spiral. According to Gold Fields, the average price of gold dropped 6 percent in 1991 to $362.26 an ounce. The average price in 1987 was $446.07.
The report does not forecast what gold might do from here. But the balance of factors discussed in the report -- slowing production, stifling production costs that exceed the prices for many mines and a surprising rise in jewelry-making despite the worldwide economic slowdown -- seem to point for now to steady, low prices.
As for the more distant future, the presentation in New York, illustrated by slides, concluded with a photo providing clues on how to divine the unknown. The picture on the screen showed tarot cards, tea leaves, a crystal ball and a model's hand, presumably for studying the art of palm reading.
Philip Klapwijk, the Gold Fields analyst for Europe and the Americas, who presented the report's results to economists and analysts in New York, gave a slightly more concrete view in a subsequent interview. "Where do we go from here?" he said. "I think it is very difficult to call. We could spike down or we could spike up. But there is a good chance that we are seeing a bottom at the moment."
The drop in the investment buying of gold is a clear signal of the decline of gold as a haven in times of political and economic crisis. According to the data, European and North American investment in gold fell by 241 tons in 1991 after increasing by 173 tons in 1990.
The drop in investment is especially notable because it came despite the Persian Gulf war, a crisis that some investors supposed would raise the price of gold.
One note in the Gold Fields report suggests that disinvestment could be intensifying: investment in Asia, which had held up well in the past, has also declined. One reason is the many more alternative investments available as Asian financial markets liberalize. This trend had already depressed gold investment in the West.
The report also says that Asians might be changing their buying habits. In the past they have bought gold when the price was falling or low and sold when it rose. Now they could be acting more like Americans and other Westerners, buying when the price of gold is rising and selling when it falls. Mr. Klapwijk said this trend could make the gold market more volatile.
As for the gold sellers in the former Soviet Union, Gold Fields does not expect the recent sales rate to continue. One reason is that mine production there is faltering.
But, at the same time, central banks, have been selling gold more aggressively. If this pattern continues, these sales could further depress the price of gold. "This is the most contentious of all questions affecting the price of gold" in the next several years, Mr. Klapwijk said.
The major central bank sellers of gold last year were Brazil, Canada and Japan. In Canada, selling gold has been a regular policy to help ease the Government's fiscal problems. In Japan, the selling was more of a one-time affair. Sixty tons of gold were sold through the distribution of a gold coin to honor the new Emperor, Akihito.
Mr. Klapwijk is not worried about central bank selling, partly because he has not seen another big central bank follow Canada's lead of selling as a matter of policy. But with the threat of Russian sales receding, he said, the market, still very bearish, seems "to need a new menace, and that is the central banks."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE RIOTS;
Tumult of Los Angeles Echoed in Long Beach

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONG BEACH, Calif., May 19

 BODY:
Once again, Cambodian refugees here have been made the victims of a sideshow, their adopted city largely ignored in its copycat wave of rioting last month, much as the fighting in their homeland was overshadowed in the 1970's by the Vietnam War.
Three hundred forty fires were set, 1 person died, 361 were injured and 1,200 people were arrested in the worst civil disorders in the history of Long Beach. But residents watching on television for news of their city found mostly the flames of Los Angeles, 20 miles north. 
 "I was watching all night but they didn't show Long Beach very much," said Satoshi Seta, who owns a row of small shops here in the nation's largest Cambodian-American community. "The only way for me to find out what happened was to come down and look."
He was one of the luckier ones. A grocery store he owns had been looted bare and a bullet had been fired through the window of his small medical center, but his jewelry store and barber shop had survived intact.
More than 17,000 Cambodians live in this city of 440,000, and much of the destruction affected their small businesses, including restaurants, grocery stores and other small shops in the neighborhoods along Anaheim Street.
When the Indochina war spilled over from Vietnam into Cambodia, the fighting in the smaller country was treated as a sideshow until 1975, when Phnom Penh fell to the Khmer Rouge and four years of mass killings followed.
On April 29, when four white police officers were acquitted in the beating of a black man, Rodney G. King, Los Angeles burst into flame and 58 people, including Matthew Haines of Long Beach, were killed. Grumblings of anger were felt in a number of other cities in the days that followed, but only Long Beach suffered its own serious outbreak of burning and looting.
Police today announced the arrests of seven Long Beach residents in connection with the death of Mr. Haines, 32 years old, who was pulled from his motorcycle and shot on the night of April 30.
 
Bandwagon of Vandalism
 City officials and residents now agree that the Long Beach riot, as destructive as it was, erupted mostly in imitation of the city's big neighbor and sometimes seemed as much a party as a protest. "I think they did it just to be doing it, just because Los Angeles was doing it," said Anthony Clarke, 14, as he leaned on his bicycle and surveyed the damage to the store where he used to buy candy.
Troy Fitzgerald, 21, said he had watched from his porch as scores of people gathered outside a row of shops across 10th Street chanting, "Break it open, break it open."
"They just went wild," he said, "taking everything they could and laughing in the street. When the police came, they just laughed and dropped everything. I think they saw what was going on in L.A. and figured they could get away with it."
Police Chief William C. Ellis noted that it took 24 hours for his city to erupt. "There was not the initial reaction to the verdict," he said. "I think people were being bombarded by visions of looters essentially walking out of stores untouched, and what we had here was a spillover."
Rotha Sieng, the owner of Khmer Market, fled the devastation of her country in 1979 as most of her fellow refugees did and settled here two years later. She said she had not realized that she had lost all her merchandise to looters until she arrived for work that Friday morning.
A refugee experienced in devastation, she seemed to have learned to ration her emotions. "When I saw that my door was broken and everything was gone," she said simply, "I said to myself, 'Oh, my.' "
Although the Cambodians suffered a heavy toll in the Long Beach damage, City Manager James C. Hankla said he did not believe they had been singled out by rioters, as Korean shop owners were in Los Angeles.
"I feel that it was more an issue of geography than an issue of ethnicity," he said, a view that was repeated by other residents and officials. The Cambodian shops are clustered in poor, ethnically mixed areas of the city where much of the looting took place.
Nevertheless, some Cambodian merchants said the rioting had fed their concerns over security. A violent rivalry between Hispanic and Cambodian gangs and extortion by a Cambodian underworld have already led some refugees to again seek safer cities.
"There is a lot of mixed feelings," said Julian Kim, a Cambodian refugee who owns a jewelry store. "Some people are thinking of moving somewhere else."
Behind the counter in her grocery store, Sokha Leng said, "It's hard to do business around here because too much stuff is going on -- gangs, drive-by shootings."
Mr. Hankla said that up to $20 million in damage occurred in Long Beach, far less than the hundreds of millions of dollars in damage suffered in Los Angeles. Swift and forceful police action helped contain the damage, he said, and officials have aggressively sought to recover stolen goods and pushed to collect private videotapes that could identify rioters.
Peter V. Ueberroth, who has been appointed by Los Angeles to oversee a long rebuilding effort, said today that Long Beach was being included in his plans for economic improvements.
But some residents, as they surveyed the blackened buildings in their neighborhoods, say they feel their city is still being treated as an afterthought.
"One thing I'm upset about is they're cleaning up Los Angeles but they're not cleaning up here," said Tamera Howard, who lives on 10th Street across from the ashes of a dry cleaner, pool hall, bakery and grocery store. "I realize Los Angeles is their priority now, but it was really horrible here, too."

HEADLINE: Bush and Top Lawmakers Confer

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 19

 BODY:
President Bush and Congressional leaders met today to try to reach a consensus on a new urban policy, but as Republican and Democratic lawmakers left the White House they voiced very different visions of what should be done in the aftermath of the civil unrest in Los Angeles.
The kernel of their dispute was predictably money. Democrats reissued their call that the 1990 budget agreement be reframed to permit transferring money from military programs to social ones. Republicans warned that giving money to inefficient city governments, most of which are controlled by Democrats, would deepen the recession and fail to improve the lives of the urban poor. 
 A consensus appears to be emerging to pass a modest package that includes tax benefits to businesses willing to invest in inner cities and a "weed and seed" program, promoted by President Bush after the riots, to bolster law enforcement and encourage community development. But Democratic efforts to create a $5 billion to $6 billion jobs program appear unlikely to receive much Republican support.
 
A 'No' to Raising Taxes
 The Republican leaders said after leaving the White House that they were in no mood for big spending programs.
"There's a unanimous feeling on our side that this is not a time to drive up the deficit and drive up interest rates," said Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the House Republican whip, "and it's not the time to raise taxes and cripple the recovery."
The Senate Republican leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, criticized big-city Democratic mayors who helped mobilize a march on Washington on Saturday to plead for more Federal aid. "We met with them privately and thought we had an understanding," he said, "but then they go out the next day and have a big march and all they do is bash Republicans, bash President Bush and ask for our help."

HEADLINE: 17% Drop In Starts Of Housing

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 19

 BODY:
In what was largely seen as a slowing in the wake of unsustainably rapid increases, builders broke ground on new homes at a rate of just 1,115,000 last month, 17 percent below the March pace, the Commerce Department reported today.
It was the biggest decline in eight years and embraced all regions of the country. In addition, permits issued for future construction fell 3.3 percent. 
 But while the drop in housing starts was considerably steeper than had been expected, most analysts said it was magnified by seasonal and other temporary factors. It thus did not represent, they said, the end of the recovery in housing that has helped generate four straight quarters of growth, albeit at a slow pace, in the economy at large.
 
A Note of Optimism
 "We're seeing it cool off," said Kevin Logan, economist for the Swiss Bank Corporation in New York. "The trend is still up," he added, noting that the April level is still 14 percent above that of April 1991.
Bond prices rallied, which helped to spur blue-chip stocks to a new peak, with the Dow Jones industrial average rising 21.96 points, to 3,397.99. [Pages D8 and D13.]
Both climbed, in the apparent belief that today's policy meeting at the Federal Reserve resulted in a decision either to cut interest rates once again or to be prepared to do so at a moment's notice.
Some analysts thought today's poor housing figures nudged the Fed further along this path, while others said the Fed had probably already decided on such action in light of other recent data on the economy, including flat retail sales over the last two months and lagging growth in the money supply.
 
Presidential Reaction
 President Bush, addressing members of the National Retail Federation at the White House, was cautiously upbeat."Things are beginning to move," he said.
He did note that surveys show "the American people still feel the economy is getting worse." But he added: "I think it will turn around. And we are going to try and not oversell where the economy stands, but at least try to gun down some of this pessimism you get on the top of every news broadcast across this country."
On the other hand, the chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders, David F. Seiders, called today's report "troublesome," particularly since it followed a report three weeks ago that sales of new single-family homes slumped 14.8 percent in March while inventories of unsold homes rose after five straight monthly declines.
"The thing that worries me is how the numbers fit together," Mr. Seiders said. "Maybe there's more here than we thought was evolving." Association surveys also show a decline in home-buyer traffic this month.
 
Talk of 'Weakness'
 Lyle E. Gramley, chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association and a former senior official of the Fed, said he found "a weakness" in housing even though today's figures "greatly exaggerate" it.
He cited the second straight decline in permits, which he said were less heavily affected than were starts by quirks in weather and statistics and were a predictor of the economy at large, though not necessarily an indication of future housing starts. He said he expected gradual improvement in the housing market in the second half of the year.
What seemed to have happened earlier this year, various specialists said, was that a combination of unseasonably warm weather, declining mortgage rates and the prospect of a tax credit for first-time buyers emboldened builders to step up activity sharply, with some of that construction being "borrowed" from the early spring.
Since then, mortgage rates have risen, early-spring weather was soggy in much of the country and hopes for tax legislation have died.
 
A Volatile Category
 Analysts also noted that the statistics on apartment buildings and other multifamily residences have been so depressed that even moderate monthly changes produce wild gyrations. Starts of dwellings with five or more units soared 73.4 percent, to a 215,000 annual rate, in March before skidding back in a record drop last month, to 123,000, about the same pace as in February.
The 17 percent April drop in overall starts followed four straight sharp advances and was the biggest decline since a 26 percent plunge in March 1984.
By region, the Midwest had a decline of 30.4 percent, to a rate of 242,000; the West was off 16.7 percent, to 265,000; the South had a decrease of 10.7 percent, to 482,000, and the Northeast was down 8.7 percent, to 126,000.
For single-family homes, the decline of 10.6 percent, to a 963,000 pace, was the biggest since January 1991. Starts for dwellings with two to four units eased to a rate of 29,000, from 52,000 in March, the report showed.
 
A Look at the Future
 Permits were at a pace of 1,058,000 -- 873,000 for single-family homes, 45,000 for two to four units and 140,000 in larger units. The West posted an increase while the three other regions fell, with permits in the Northeast down to a rate of 109,000, from 124,000 in March.
Actual starts, before seasonal adjustment, totaled 109,700 in April, compared with 111,600 the month before. Permits on this basis rose to 105,300 from 97,900.
Shipments of mobile homes, figures for which are a month behind the other data, ran at a 197,000 annual rate in March, the same as in February.

HEADLINE: Yields Down Moderately On Bank Funds and C.D.'s

 BODY:
Yields on bank money market accounts and certificates of deposit fell moderately in the week ended today, The Bank Rate Monitor said in its most recent survey.
The decline for the last week was sharper outside the New York area, where the yields on both money market accounts and six-month certificates of deposit dropped four basis points. There are 100 basis points in a percentage point. In the New York area, the average commercial bank and savings banks rates were off one basis point. 
 Yet the 20 major banks nationwide are still offering higher interest rates on money market accounts -- 3.32 percent on average -- than New York commercial banks, where the average rate is 3.12 percent. The nationwide average is also higher on six-month certificates of deposit: 3.67 percent, compared with a 3.45 percent average in New York.
But New York savings banks were offering higher rates, with 3.74 percent on money market accounts and 3.94 percent on six-month C.D.'s. The average rate on three-month C.D.'s for savings banks was 3.72 percent, compared with 3.37 percent for commercial banks.
 
'Yields Remain Depressed'
 Robert Heady, publisher of The Bank Rate Monitor, said that despite the decline in the last week, bank interest rates had been relatively flat for the last 15 weeks.
Yet he said the "continual slippage in short-term yields" did point to another probable easing in interest rates by the Federal Reserve. "The simple fact," he added, "is that yields remain depressed because loan demand is extremely weak."
The largest reductions for the week all came at the Greater New York Savings Bank. It reduced its money market account interest rate 15 basis points, to 3.60 percent; its three-month C.D. 10 basis points, to 3.60 percent, and its six-month C.D. 15 basis points, to 3.75 percent.
Fleet Bank in New York increased its interest rate on its three-month and six-month certificates one basis point each, to 3.56 percent and 3.66 percent.


GRAPHIC: Annual effective yields, in percent, on money market accounts, three-month certificates of deposit and six-month C.D.'s expected at selected institutions on Wednesday, May 20, 1992. Some C.D. yields assume reinvestment after maturity. Yields are based on themethod of compounding and the rate stated for the lowest minimum to open an account, but minimums may vary. Higher yields may be offered for larger deposits. C.D. figures are for fixed rates only.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Securities Up Sharply

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The weakest monthly set of housing data in eight years pushed prices of Treasury securities up sharply yesterday, and long-term interest rates fell to their lowest levels since early February.
The housing data showed that starts fell by 17 percent last month, and that permits to build new houses fell for the second straight month. The figures were far weaker than Wall Street economists had expected, and heightened expectations among credit market participants that the Federal Reserve Board would move soon to lower short-term interest rates. 
 However, the Fed, whose policy-making Open Market Committee was meeting in Washington when the Government reported the plunge in housing starts, did nothing to show its hand yesterday.
But analysts said the Fed could ill afford to ignore the report or its implications.
"The Fed will not ease on the basis of these housing statistics, which were partly due to abnormally cold weather in April and partly due to rising mortgage interest rates," said Lyle E. Gramley, chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association. "But if you are sitting over at the Fed, you have to be worried. This recovery may be in trouble again."
John R. Williams, a managing director for global markets economics at the Bankers Trust Company, said that the housing data, in conjunction with weak money supply growth and continued low inflation, "certainly gives the Fed the latitude to ease."
But Mr. Williams cautioned that another easing move would not be without some risks.
"In the final analysis, the last two easing moves have done nothing to get long-term rates down," he said. "If you really want to get an improved economy, you want to get long rates down. In that context, the market may be better served by a steady monetary policy."
 
Decline in Bond Yields
 Bond yields have moved slowly but steadily lower over the last few weeks, and declined yesterday to their lowest level since Feb. 7.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 29 1/2 year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 102 23/32 , up 5/8 point, to yield 7.76 percent, compared with 7.81 percent late Monday.
The improvement in bond prices was outstripped by the performance of Treasury issues with maturities of less than five years, securities that stand to benefit most, should the Fed cut short-term rates again.
Among outstanding note issues, the 5 7/8 percent three-year notes were offered at 100 29/32 late yesterday, up 11/32 , to yield 5.54 percent.
Prices of the new two-year and five-year Treasury notes to be sold today and tomorrow also rose sharply.
The two-year notes were offered on a when-issued basis late yesterday at a price to yield 5.03 percent, compared with 5.17 percent late Monday. And the five-year notes were offered in late when-issued trading at a price to yield 6.49 percent, compared with 6.62 percent late Monday.
Rates on outstanding Treasury bills moved lower.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 3.52 percent late yesterday, down seven basis points, or seven one-hundredths of a percentage point. And six-month bill rates fell by nine basis points, to a late offered rate of 3.60 percent.
The weak housing numbers and the rally they touched off in the Treasury securities market were a boon to New York City yesterday.
The city was able to sell $1.04 billion worth of general obligation bonds at interest rates that were roughly 10 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, below levels that were seen as likely by municipal bond participants on Monday.
Through underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs & Company, the city securities were priced at yields of 5.35 percent in 1994, 6.30 percent in 1997, 7 percent in 2002, 7.28 percent in 2015 and a maximum yield of 7.26 percent on bonds maturing in 2022.
Underwriters reported good demand for the new bonds. The securities are rated Baa-1 by Moody's Investors Service and A- by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
The rates on the securities sold yesterday are roughly 1.25 percentage points below city bond yields a year ago, when New York's financial crisis was at its nadir.
According to city officials, the drop in rates from last year will save New York more than $150 million in debt service costs.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds, traders said the rise in Treasury prices helped pull up prices of most widely quoted municipal issues by 1/4 point to 3/8 point.
New-issue activity was also brisk in the corporate bond market.
Among the issuers was the Limited Inc., which offered $150 million worth of 10-year noncallable notes through underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs.
The 7.80 percent notes were priced at $99.86, to yield 7.82 percent, 60 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing.
The issue is rated A-1 by Moody's and A by Standard & Poor's.
Merrill Lynch & Company acted as lead manager on a high-yield offering from Royal Caribbean Cruise Ltd.
The company offered $126 million worth of 10-year 11 3/8 percent senior subordinated notes at a price of $99.26, to yield 11.50 percent, 4.25 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing.
The securities, which are noncallable for five years, are rated Ba-3 by Moody's and BB- by Standard & Poor's.

HEADLINE: Some Back Florio on Tax; Others Side With G.O.P.

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, May 19

 BODY:
Republicans swept to total dominance of the New Jersey Legislature last November by riding a crest of voter anger over Gov. Jim Florio's tax increase in 1990. So the one thing that is clear is that the people of New Jersey want a tax cut, and anybody who stands in the way is committing political suicide. Right?
Wrong. 
 Consider Helynn Masullo Burns of Closter, who is 70 years old and sports a little American flag on the back of the big black tricycle she was pedaling home with $87 worth of groceries in the basket on the back.
"I'm the last one to get into politics," she said, "but everybody seems to be so much against Florio. I don't know what or why, but when it comes to this 1 percent tax business, it makes no difference to me. Leave it at 7 percent. It's going to be raised somewhere else, isn't it?"
Or listen to 35-year-old Carl Doebel of Bloomfield, who was boarding an N.J. Transit train in Hoboken, coming home from his job as an assistant vice president for Bankers Trust in New York City. Mr. Doebel is a Republican but opposes repeal of the sales tax, saying: "I am in favor of what Florio is doing and I am against the G.O.P.'s behavior in the state capital."
 
'Mickey Mousing Around'
 "If I could," he said, "I would tell them to their faces that I demand more substance instead of this Mickey Mousing around in Trenton. We vote these people in and then have to watch this stuff going on. It's discouraging. It almost makes you think that all the intelligence in the state is going into the private sector, and the dregs of our society are moving into the public sector."
Such sentiments are not universal, but it is clear that while New Jersey taxpayers are frustrated and angry over their tax bills, they are by no means universal in the belief that a sales tax cut is advisable.
In fact, a Star-Ledger/Eagleton Poll released on Sunday shows that support for the Governor's approving the reduction in the sales tax, to 6 cents from 7, is only slightly greater than support for a veto. That is true despite the fact that it was primarily anger over a one-cent increase in the sales tax that fueled the voter rebellion that swept out the Democratic majority last November and replaced it with a Republican majority of two-thirds in both houses of the Legislature.
The Republicans' very first order of business was to roll back the increase, which will take $608 million out of the budget for the fiscal year that begins on July 1. Governor Florio vetoed the reduction on the ground that the Republicans have not said what programs, jobs or services they will cut to make up the difference.
Recent polls, bolstered by random interviews, show clearly that voters do want taxes lowered -- but not if it means giving up services.
Jim Mazzei of Park Ridge, a 31-year-old management consultant in New York City, says he is not happy with the sales tax, "but it's irresponsible to cut back without making corresponding cuts on the cost side."
Over all, about 6 in 10 New Jerseyans surveyed in the Star-Ledger/Eagleton Poll disapproved of a tax repeal if it results in a cutback in services.
However, about half the respondents thought it was possible to cut $600 million from the budget without reducing services.
On the question of the rightness or wrongess of the Governor's veto, about half -- 49 percent -- thought the Governor should approve the reduction, but only slightly fewer -- 43 percent -- thought he should veto it. The poll was taken before the Governor actually vetoed the sales-tax measure on Monday.
 
'Wrong on This One'
 Many in New Jersey appear to share the Governor's view that cuts should be identified before revenues are reduced. "I don't believe in government by veto," said Hank Greenfield, 46, an unemployed computer salesman from Hopatcong, "but I don't think Florio was wrong on this one. Where is the money coming from? Nobody seems to have any idea here."
Similarly, Jesse Moskowitz, a Jersey City lawyer who still puts in a full workweek at age 81, said: "If there is going to be a reduction in the sales tax, people should demand to know what programs will be sacrificed. Will the loss in revenue be linked with reductions in the homestead rebate program, school aid or other social programs?"
Referring to the poll data indicating that people want a tax cut but no reductions in services, Mr. Moskowitz said: "People are not thinking this through. They can't have it both ways."
 
Hoping for Tax Break
 There were some, however, who favored cutting taxes, even if it did mean reducing services.
Ron Cade, 41, who works for Paine Webber in Weehawken, was disappointed about the veto. "I was hoping for a bit of a tax break," he said. "I bought a car for $15,000; 1 percent would have saved me $150. But nobody's going to balance the budget and make everybody happy without cutting services."
But one sentiment that seems to seems to hang over the debate like a dark cloud is a failure of trust in government.
"I don't know who's telling the truth at this point," said 71-year-old Violet Arffman of Rockaway.

HEADLINE: U.S. Finds Japan Unfair In Pricing Its Mini-Vans

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 19

 BODY:
Supporting Detroit's Big Three, the Bush Administration said today that Japanese mini-vans were being sold in the United States at improperly low prices, a decision that will further strain trade relations between the two countries and could produce higher sticker prices for the imported Japanese vehicles.
The Commerce Department ruling -- that Mazda mini-vans were being sold at 12.7 percent below their fair value and Toyota vans at 6.75 percent below fair value -- pleased General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, which sought an investigation last year. 
 Mazda said it was "mystified" and "astonished" by the decision, while Toyota officials called the decision "factual fantasy."
The International Trade Commission, a Federal agency, now has 45 days to rule whether the unfair pricing, known as dumping, has injured the American industry. If it rules that is has, penalty duties will be imposed on the Japanese mini-vans. It would be the first time such duties were placed on Japanese passenger vehicles.
Dumping occurs when a foreign company sells its goods in the United States below its domestic price or below its production cost plus a reasonable profit. In this case, the Commerce Department concluded that most mini-vans that the Toyota Motor Corporation and the Mazda Motor Corporation sold at home were sold at a loss, so the department instead sought to use their production cost plus reasonable profit as a measure of fair value.
The Big Three, led by the Chrysler Corporation, invented the mini-van and dominate the market. But they argued that Japan's van makers, who were late with a competitive product, were aggressively selling their mini-vans at illegally low prices to gain American market share.
The finding of dumping heightened tensions just a day after the heads of the leading American and Japanese auto makers met outside Chicago to try to resolve their differences. Some industry analysts said that in bringing this case in a segment of the car market that Detroit pioneered and dominates, the Big Three showed a new aggressiveness in seeking to protect their turf against Japanese encroachment.
Some representatives of the Japanese industry said today's decision, coming in an election year, was political and showed that the Administration had concluded that it could win votes by getting tough with Japan's auto makers. They cited the President's trip to Tokyo last December as another political move.
Representatives of the Japanese industry said it was ludicrous to bring the mini-van case because the Big Three had 88 percent of the market. Chrysler had 45 percent of the 1991 mini-van market, the General Motors Corporation had 26.2 percent, and the Ford Motor Company had 16.8 percent. Imports had 12 percent.
James Olson, vice president of external affairs for Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., said the decision "may be politically correct, but it's factual fantasy." He added, "The Big Three's reaction to our modest success" in the mini-van market "is like a herd of elephants being stampeded by two mice."
According to the Commerce Department, about 95,000 Japanese mini-vans were sold in the United States in 1990 at a value of $1.2 billion. In 1991, Toyota sold 52,099 of its Previa mini-vans in the United States and Mazda sold 48,056 of its MPV mini-vans.
 
Higher Prices
 Mazda's mini-vans have a base price of from $17,710 to $21,360, so the imposition of 12.7 percent dumping duties could raise sticker prices by between $2,250 and $2,710. The base sticker price of Toyota's mini-vans is from $17,518 to $25,518, so a 6.75 percent duty could raise prices between $1,182 and $1,722. Japan's auto makers said this would provide an umbrella to allow American producers of mini-vans to raise their prices.
Big Three officials were heartened that today's final determination on dumping found far higher dumping margins than a preliminary decision last December, which found that Mazda's vans were selling at 7.19 percent below fair value and Toyota's at 0.95 percent below. The case involves sales of mini-vans between Oct. 1, 1990, and May 31, 1991, when the Big Three asked for an investigation.
Today's decision found that all other Japanese mini-vans were selling at 9.88 percent below fair value on average; the preliminary decision had said that they were selling at an average of 4.23 percent below fair value. The Big Three's dumping complaint mentioned only Toyota and Mazda, which are the dominant mini-van importers.
 
Rise in Market Share
 Thomas Hanna, president of the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association in Detroit, said the Big Three had brought the case because they were convinced the Japanese were dumping as their market share increased from 3 percent to about 12 percent in three years.
"This product was invented in the U.S.," Mr. Hanna said. "When the American companies saw the rapidity with which the Japanese were penetrating the market, it was alarming. The question is, do you stand back until the segment is decimated by the Japanese or do you ask for an investigation? I think it was a wise thing to do."
One unfair mini-van pricing practice that the Commerce Department found was that component suppliers sometimes sold parts for mini-vans planned for sale in Japan for far less than what they charged for similar parts for Japanese mini-vans destined for the United States.
Toyota had argued that these pricing differentials resulted from the economics of the fact that it sells far fewer of mini-vans in Japan than in the United States. But the Commerce Department's decision said these arguments were "unconvincing."
Mazda issued a statement that denounced today's decision and added that there was "no possibility" that Mazda's sales "have caused any material injury" to the Big Three. It added that Chrysler's mini-van sales were so strong that the American company recently added a third shift at its mini-van plant in St. Louis.
"The department's finding is based on the absurd conclusion that Mazda is selling the MPV at a loss in Japan and in the United States, which we know is not the case," Mazda said.

The Administration has agreed with the Big Three American auto makers, which invented the mini-van and dominate the market, that two Japanese companies sold vans in the United States at illegally low prices to gain market share, a practice known as dumping.

HEADLINE: A Closing High: Dow Rises 21.96, to 3,397.99

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stock prices rose on Wall Street yesterday, carrying the Dow Jones industrial average to a new closing high, as investors read a disappointing economic report as portending a possible cut in interest rates.
The Dow rose 21.96 points to close at 3,397.99, eclipsing the previous mark of 3,397.58 set on May 11. It was the Dow's 20th record this year. 
 Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones, 1,010 to 698, on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume on the Big Board came to 189.4 million shares, up from 151.4 million on Monday. The exchange's composite index rose 1.73, to 229.32.
 
Broader Gauges Up
 The broader market was also higher. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 3.56, to 416.37, while the American Stock Exchange's composite index finished 0.85 higher at392.37, and the Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter trading gained 1.52, to 578.05.
Stock prices rose broadly despite a Commerce Department report showing that housing starts plunged 17 percent last month, the largest drop in eight years. Economists had forecast only a 6.1 percent decline.
But gloomy economic reports sometimes prod the Federal Reserve into lowering interest rates to help the economy, and stocks rose on that expectation, analysts said. Lower interest rates could help stock prices.
Bonds rallied on the weak housing data and the central bank speculation as the Fed's Open Market Committee met to discuss the economy.
"The market has held up quite well considering the disappointing housing starts," said Michael Metz, an analyst with Oppenheimer & Company. "There is hope the Fed will push short-term rates down."
 
'Investors Are Troubled'
 Hugh Johnson, the chief investment officer with the First Albany Corporation, said many investors were sitting on the sidelines, waiting to see what the Fed would do.
"Investors are troubled," Mr. Johnson said. "They believe the market is overvalued. They're worried that the stock market has come too far too fast."
The market has been edging toward the 3,400 level since last week but has been unable to break through the mark except briefly. Analysts have said investors are uncertain about the strength of the economic recovery and whether it will support stocks at their current prices.
 
Blue Chips Fare Well

HEADLINE: Industrial Lands Renew Call for Trade Accord

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, May 19

 BODY:
A group of major industrialized nations called anew today for early completion of the current global trade liberalization talks, warning that failure would risk bringing "fragmentation, conflict and inefficiency" to international commercial relations.
Yet nothing occurred at the annual ministerial meeting of the 24-nation Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development to suggest that the main obstacle to success -- a deadlock between the United States and the European Community over agricultural subsidies -- was close to being overcome. 
 The community's chief negotiator, Frans Andriessen, rejected the suggestion that only the Western European producers should make concessions. Mr. Andriessen will meet with the United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, in Washington next week in one more attempt to break the deadlock.
 
Dispute Over Agriculture
 "There is no way the community will be able to accept a deal if it is not comprehensive in terms of agriculture, services, market access, etc.," he told reporters here, asserting that the United States was being inflexible on these related issues.
The head of the American delegation, Commerce Secretary Barbara H. Franklin, in turn said she was surprised to find Mr. Andriessen blaming Washington for the absence of agreement. "Everyone knows and accepts that the major impediment is the community's stance on agricultural subsidies," she said.
In a statement after their two-day meeting here, ministers from the 24 O.E.C.D. countries said world economic growth would be promoted by completion of the current round of trade talks, known as the Uruguay Round for the site of its first meeting, in Punta del Este, Uruguay, in 1986. "An early conclusion is urgently needed," the statement said. "For that purpose, the process of negotiations now stalled needs to be reinvigorated."
The organization consists of the European countries outside the former Communist bloc, plus the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. Much of the closed-door meeting was given over to analysis by the members of how the major industrial nations could contribute to maintaining the current cautious economic recovery. Germany was urged to lower interest rates, Japan to stimulate domestic demand and the United States to keep fighting its fiscal deficit.
But, with this debate overshadowed by preparations for the scheduled summit meeting of the Group of Seven industrial powers in Germany in July, the French Finance Minister, Michel Sapin, was the only finance minister of the seven to attend this week's meeting here.
 
Concern About Unemployment
 The gathering nonetheless spotlighted the perils implicit in the chronically high unemployment levels of O.E.C.D. members, up by 5 million, to 30 million, over the last two years and running at twice the level of 20 years ago.
Norway's Finance Minister, Sigbjorn Johnsen, the chairman of the meeting, noted that unemployment levels had remained high even during the expansion years of the 1980's. "Young people who fear a future without adequate education and jobs represent a grave danger to political stability," he said.
While emphasizing the need for improved education and training systems, the ministers called on the organization to prepare a report for next year's meeting on remedies to "the disappointing progress" in cutting unemployment, which now averages 7.5 percent in the 24 countries.
The ministers were more upbeat about prospects for economic growth, with the organization's secretariat projecting that growth among the members would rise from 1.0 percent last year to 1.8 percent this year and 3.0 percent next year. For the United States, it forecast growth of 2.1 percent this year and 3.6 percent in 1993.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Continues to Retreat And Gold Prices Are Mixed

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar's selloff continued yesterday on world currency markets, spurred by a report showing a steep decline in United States housing starts in April.
Gold prices were mixed. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $337.80 an ounce, off $1.10 from Monday. The Republic National Bank said gold fell 90 cents an ounce, to a late bid price of $337.50. 
 The dollar was weakened by selling overnight in foreign markets, and the trend was exacerbated by a United States Government report showing housing starts plunged 17 percent in April, the largest drop in eight years, with each region of the country suffering declines.
Analysts had expected construction to slow in April after four sharp monthly advances, but the extent of the drop was unexpected. Another worrisome factor that appeared in the Commerce Department report showed a 3.3 percent decline in building permit applications, often considered a barometer of future activity.
"This gave the market a little room to move on the downside," said Randolph Donney, research director at Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J.
But shortly after the report was released, the domestic market appeared to stabilize. "It's getting to the point where all this bad news has to be converted into an actual monetary policy change," Mr. Donney said.
The Federal Reserve's policy-making arm, the Open Market Committee, met yesterday in Washington but did not take any immediate action to lower interest rates in an effort to spur the economic recovery.
"The general consensus is that the Fed may go as far as cutting" rates in coming days, said Michael Malpede, an analyst with Refco Inc. in Chicago.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 130.30 yen, down 2.30 yen from Monday's close. Later, in London, it fell to 129.05 yen. In New York the dollar settled at 129.10 yen, up from 128.75 yen on Monday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.8400, from $1.8355 late Monday. In New York it cost $1.8385 to buy one pound, more expensive than Monday's $1.8365.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's rates included: 1.5905 German marks, down from 1.5955; 1.4600 Swiss francs, down from 1.4650; 5.3475 French francs, down from 5.3580; 1,197.00 Italian lire, down from 1,201.00, and 1.1944 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1987.
Gold fell in London to a late bid of $338.65 a troy ounce, from $338.85 bid late Monday. In Zurich, it rose to a closing bid of $339.50 from $338.80. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.24 an ounce to close at $339.89.
Silver prices were steady to lower. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery settled at $4.079 a troy ounce, down from $4.087 on Monday. In London it was unchanged at a late bid price of $4.09.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
2 Big Agencies Waiting for Chrysler's Other Shoe to Fall

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
THERE is an adage in the agency business that shops should approach their work as if every advertisement they create for clients might be their last. Now, two giant agencies handling two giant automotive accounts are confronting exactly that unpleasant possibility, because one of those accounts has been a target for extinction.
Last week, Robert J. Eaton, the designated successor to Lee A. Iacocca as chairman of the Chrysler Corporation, confirmed speculation that the No. 3 auto maker would phase out one of its four car lines to reduce sales and marketing costs and, it is hoped, improve the awareness of Chrysler's remaining brands.
Any such decision, said Mr. Eaton, who is Chrysler's vice chairman, would affect either Plymouth or Eagle, which sell fewer units than the company's Dodge and Chrysler nameplates.
Not since 1960 has an automotive agency faced a similar problem. Then, too, it was Chrysler that discontinued one of its car lines, DeSoto, in a decision that cost BBDO , which had handled DeSoto since 1944, a multimillion-dollar acount.
The demise of Plymouth, which Chrysler introduced in 1928 as an alternative to lower-priced automobiles like Chevrolet and Ford --"Look at all three," early campaigns urged -- would be a blow to Bozell Inc. in Southfield, Mich. Plymouth ad spending last year totaled $36.1 million, according to Advertising Age.
And if the Eagle brand, which had an estimated $29 million in ad spending last year, goes, it would be a blow to Campbell-Mithun-Esty , which also handles that account out of Southfield, a Detroit suburb. Chrysler introduced Eagle in 1987 after acquiring American Motors, which had developed the line as an automobile companion to its Jeep sports-utility vehicles.
As a result of Chrysler's plans, each agency finds itself in a highly unusual position. Not only is each required to continue selling cars to consumers in an unruly economic climate, agency executives must somehow also sell the client, no less, on the necessity of continuing the car line itself.
"The only thing the agencies can do is to make a last-ditch effort to sell the strategy for those products and how they fit into the marketplace," said Allen A. McCusker, a principal of the Canaan Parish Group, an advertising and marketing consulting company in New Canaan, Conn.
"Go in and make a defense," he advised, "that says, 'If you spend more money and say so-and-so, we could make a business out of this.' "
Two executives who advertise automobiles not directly competitive with Plymouth or Eagle also offered suggestions.
"Either agency should not worry about itself, but about Chrysler," said Marvin Sloves, chairman and chief executive of Scali, McCabe, Sloves in New York, which handles Mercedes-Benz of North America's national account. "It's an opportunity to show you care about the client," Mr. Sloves added. "The very act of doing that, being honest and fair, might help you get more business from Chrysler."
Indeed, advertising history bolsters Mr. Sloves's argument, because BBDO did not fare too badly when Chrysler closed DeSoto. To compensate the agency for that loss, Chrysler awarded BBDO another of its accounts, Dodge, which had been at the Grant agency. And BBDO has kept Dodge to this day.
But Martin Puris, president and chief executive at Ammirati & Puris in New York, which handles BMW of North America, was less sanguine about the agencies' ability to influence Chrysler.
"An agency in this sort of situation is trapped," he said. "They can make the case for their particular brands, but in the end, the decision will be made for such a wide variety of reasons. I would say my prayers."
For whichever agency whose car line is selected to go the way of the Packard and Studebaker, the loss is likely to be cushioned by additional work that it already performs for Chrysler.
Besides Plymouth, Bozell handles advertising under the Chrysler name, for Chrysler cars, the Town and Country mini-van and corporate image ads. Chrysler ad spending totaled $119.7 million last year, according to Advertising Age.
And in addition to Eagle, Campbell-Mithun-Esty handles Jeep. According to Advertising Age, Chrysler spent $58.2 million last year on Jeep ads.

Doubts Are Disappearing As Guerrero Shows the Way

BYLINE: By JOSEPH SIANO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: INDIANAPOLIS, May 19

 BODY:
Roberto Guerrero is amazed, and slightly upset, at how much healthier he has looked to everyone else since May 9.
That was the day he won the pole position for the Indianapolis 500 on Sunday by clocking a speed of 232.482 miles an hour. 
 "Right now, everyone tells me, 'Well, you're finally back,' " he said last weekend, "which makes me a little mad because I've been fine for years."
What he is finally back from -- at least in the outside world's perception -- is an accident at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway on Sept. 10, 1987, that left him in a coma for several days.
 
A Four-Year Decline
 Guerrero, who was born in Colombia and is now an American citizen, finished second in a 200-mile Indy-car race in Phoenix in his return to racing in April 1988, but doubts about him persisted, probably because his career went into a four-year slide.
This month, he and his teammate, Jim Crawford of Scotland, have had the sport of Indy-car racing chasing them for a change.
"I couldn't say this place owes me something," said the 33-year-old Guerrero. "I mean, this place has been very good to me."
In his first four races here, starting in 1984, he was second, third, fourth and second, in that order, with the runner-up spot in 1987 coming after a stalled engine on a pit stop robbed him of an almost certain victory.
"It hurt me one time," he said of the Speedway, "but over all, it's come back again. It's given me probably the biggest thrill of my career, sitting on the pole here."
It also gave him a $110,000 bonus and $35,000 van for the pole spot.
Guerrero's recovery from his coma, which was caused by a tire that hit his head when his car struck the wall during a tire-testing run, was aided in large part by the devotion and persistence of his wife, Katie.
"The doctors said Katie stayed by my side every day and she talked to me," Guerrero said. "She brought our boys over. And the doctors said that, obviously, it's impossible to know how I would have recuperated if she wasn't around."
"I taped Marco a lot," Katie said, referring to their only son at the time, "and I played that. I sang children's songs every night. I just kept the chatter up.
"We have such an incredible bond. I almost felt like I was concentrating twice as much for the two of us."
Guerrero recovered fully, and before he resumed Indy-car racing in 1988, with the full support of his wife, he used video games, among other things, to sharpen his neurological system and recover the eye-hand coordination necessary in this sport of split-second decisions.
 
An Unhappy Venture
 After his successful runner-up showing in his return, his team, Vince Granatelli Racing, had trouble the rest of the year. He was eager to listen when Alfa-Romeo approached him with plans for an Indy-car engine.
He bought out his contract with Granatelli, but soon regretted it. "It's still mind-boggling to me how they could have been that bad," Guerrero said with a laugh.
Those responsible for the Indy project refused to admit that the engine was no good, so they compensated, Guerrero said, by blaming everybody, including the team owner and the driver, and everything else, including the chassis.
Guerrero's turn as a scapegoat came at the end of 1990, when Danny Sullivan replaced him.
"Then they found out it wasn't the team, it wasn't the chassis, it wasn't the driver," Guerrero said.
Guerrero, who had a year left on his contract, reached an agreement with Alfa that allowed him to drive for the team at Indy last year. After getting into an accident with another driver after only 23 laps, he was an unemployed racer.
 
Joins Bernstein Team
 Kenny Bernstein, a Dallas-based drag racer who owns the King Motorsports Indy-car team, had always been impressed by Guerrero. Bernstein let Guerrero drive one of his cars in four races after Indy, and Crawford and Guerrero began intensive testing for this year's race last September.
The two of them have been kicking the speed records here higher this month. On May 4, Crawford ran the fastest practice lap in Speedway history at 233.433 miles per hour.
Five days later, Guerrero's four-lap average of 232.482 m.p.h. obliterated Emerson Fittipaldi's two-year-old record of 225.301.

HEADLINE: Licenses, and Liberty

 BODY:
The legislation is called "motor voter" for short, and by approving it today the Senate can enlarge democracy. Exhorting citizens to vote is mere piety without doing what this bill would do, make it easier to register to vote.
Barely half the eligible voters participated in the 1988 Presidential election and, given wide expressions of disgust with politics, there's no reason to think turnout will improve this year. Indeed, it can't improve much so long as only 60 percent of eligible voters are registered. 
 The "motor voter" measure holds tremendous promise for increasing registration -- to an estimated 90 percent. It would require states to allow citizens to register to vote when they apply for or renew a driver's license.
The bill is sponsored by Senator Wendell Ford, Democrat of Kentucky, and Senator Mark Hatfield, Republican of Oregon. It would also require states to permit registration by mail, instead of forcing citizens to appear in person at some municipal office, the discouraging requirement still exacted in 25 states. States would also be required to distribute registration forms and give assistance at public agencies like unemployment and welfare offices.
These common sense steps deserve the support of all who care about expanding democracy. Indeed, a similar bill passed the House in 1990 with strong bipartisan support. Yet Senate Republicans, evidently out of fear that unregistered voters are more likely to vote Democratic, have succeeded in blocking "motor voter" from even getting to the floor -- that is, until today.
By joining the present honorable band of Republicans who support the measure, Republicans like Alfonse D'Amato of New York and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania can show the kind of bipartisanship "motor voter" needs if it's to have a realistic chance of avoiding a veto.
Opponents of "motor voter" say they're worried about cost and vote fraud. But these concerns are exaggerated. What's hard to exaggerate is the shame Americans confront in a system that leaves only six of every ten eligible voters registered. The Senate today can vote to efface that shame and enfranchise the other four.

HEADLINE: Brutal Betrayal in Thailand

 BODY:
Apologists for last year's military coup in Thailand argued that it was benign, even constructive. The democratic government it ousted was clearly corrupt. The technocrats it appointed to office were intelligent, honest and competent. And the coup's mastermind, Gen. Suchinda Kraprayoon, solemnly promised that he would never take political power into his own hands.
But constructive coups are as rare in real life as unicorns. Today, General Suchinda runs Thailand as its unelected Prime Minister. He has brought back corruption and suffocates democratic government. Worst of all, he has ordered his troops to fire their M-16's at pro-democracy demonstrators. Scores have been shot in Bangkok. Protests have spread to other cities and the death toll climbs. 
 It's up to Thai leaders, especially King Bhumibol Adulyadej, to resolve this crisis by re-establishing democratic rule. The United States can also play a useful role. Already, it has suspended most forms of cooperation with this bloodstained regime. Now it needs to denounce General Suchinda in the strongest terms.
Words matter in Thailand, especially when Washington is their source. Bangkok will go to considerable lengths to avoid jeopardizing its military and economic links to the U.S. Several weeks ago, for example, the Bush Administration eliminated a proposed prime minister from further consideration when it denounced him as a suspected drug figure and therefore ineligible to travel to the United States.
Surely Americans regard shooting peaceful demonstrators to be as repulsive as drug dealing. Declaring General Suchinda persona non grata could spur his departure or a face-saving compromise.
Chamlong Srimuang, the leader of the current protests, is a former general. But in two terms as Governor of Bangkok, he earned respect for decency, competence and devotion to democratic ideals. Those ideals are now supported by many in the urban middle and working classes.
Until recently, Thailand seemed poised for further economic gains. Now it risks being dragged down into turmoil. By putting personal ambition ahead of Thailand's best interests, General Suchinda has betrayed the rhetoric of his own coup. And he has betrayed his country.

HEADLINE: Dialogue: A Voodoo Amendment?;
Discipline Is Overdue

BYLINE: By Paul Simon; Paul Simon, Democrat of Illinois, is a member of the Senate Budget Committee.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The balanced budget constitutional amendment I have introduced now has 14 Republican and 16 Democratic co-sponsors. It is more workable than the version Ronald Reagan championed and more flexible than Thomas Jefferson's suggestion that the Constitution ban deficits.
The amendment would make fiscal responsibility the general rule instead of the rare exception. This is needed because the political will to reduce the deficit is absent in the White House and in Congress. Critics wish for the day when our leaders will come to grips with the deficit crisis without a constitutional crutch. But danger is upon us. 
 Expect new fiscal discipline under this amendment, but don't expect an ironclad guarantee. The Constitution is no place for airtight procedural details that can withstand budgetary tricks a future Administration or Congress might dream up.
The amendment requires the President to submit a balanced budget to Congress. Congress and the President must then enact and abide by annual budgets in which receipts match outlays, unless 60 percent of the House and Senate vote to set the requirement aside, for whatever reason, in any year.
If two-thirds of the House and Senate approve the amendment, it must be ratified by three-fourths of the states. It would take effect two years after ratification by the last state, perhaps five years from now, although the legislation allows seven years for ratification. Congress and the President would have several years before the starting date to begin controlling the deficit, and would have a powerful incentive to do so.
The amendment has special importance today because few if any alternatives are left. The deficit and interest payments are veering further out of control, imperiling the economy, our trading picture and our domestic obligations.
In 1986, the last time the Senate voted on a balanced budget amendment, the Federal debt was $2 trillion; by the end of 1992, it will top $4 trillion.
The rising interest payments, which the amendment would cap, are sobering. In the next fiscal year, for the first time we will spend more on gross interest -- $315 billion -- than on any budget item, including defense or Social Security. We get no education, health care, crime prevention, infrastructure and environmental protection from that money. Unless the interest figure is capped, the next 10 years will see even worse figures.
The $315 billion in interest will be America's largest income redistribution payout ever. The money will come primarily from people of limited means and go to those wealthy enough to invest in Treasury bills, more and more of whom live in countries like Saudi Arabia and Japan.
Higher interest costs and inflation that stem from the budget deficit discourage industrial investment, hurt exports, help imports and widen the trade deficit. For every dollar the budget deficit is reduced, the trade deficit will be cut 32 to 47 cents.
We rely heavily on the Social Security Trust Funds to buy Federal bonds. Starting in the year 2010, the number of retirees will rise dramatically. As payouts increase, there will be three options. We can dramatically reduce Social Security benefits, which would be extremely unpopular; dramatically raise taxes, also unpopular, or print more money, devaluing our currency. The third solution is politically the easiest, and most dangerous. Yet that's where we're headed if we don't act now.
Unless Congress discards business-as-usual, the deficit will shape our destiny. Virtually every major area of policy is being squeezed or ignored because of runaway interest payments. This should trouble liberals and conservatives, for no one's interests are served when such sums are wasted.
In an ideal world, a balanced budget amendment would not be necessary. In the real world, it is.

HEADLINE: Dialogue: A Voodoo Amendment?;
No Will. No Way!

BYLINE: By Rudolph G. Penner; Rudolph G. Penner directs economic studies at KPMG Peat Marwick, an accounting firm.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
If there is little political will to realize a goal, putting it into the Constitution will not help. Thus, a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget will work as well as the Prohibition amendment.
The futility of using constitutions to balance budgets is clear from the experience of state governments. While 49 have constitutional provisions or legislation requiring a balanced budget, many routinely resort to outrageous accounting gimmicks to "balance" budgets, and many have created "off-budget" agencies. State provisions, which generally apply only to operating budgets, often permit borrowing for capital budgets. 
 My experience watching the operation of Gramm-Rudman while director of the Congressional Budget Office in the mid-80's convinced me of the undesirability of legislating numerical goals for the deficit. Gramm-Rudman originally promised to balance the budget by fiscal 1991. The deficit that year set an all-time record. The goal was missed by $269 billion. A revised version of Gramm-Rudman postponed the goal of a balanced budget to 1993. That goal may be missed by more than $300 billion.
Some say that Gramm-Rudman, while failing miserably to achieve its explicit goals, nonetheless lowered the deficit below what it would have been otherwise. Maybe so, but the cost was too high.
Gramm-Rudman produced forecasts that promised to achieve deficit goals when there was little hope of coming close to them. It spawned accounting gimmicks that seemed to make the deficit lower than it really was. Some gimmicks cost the taxpayers money. For example, people who borrowed from the Government when interest rates were high were allowed to repay the loans early without a pre-payment penalty. This made the deficit appear lower, but the Government lost significant interest income.
More important, Gramm-Rudman encouraged Congress to behave cynically, helping to spawn the public's hostility toward Congress. The pressures Gramm-Rudman created pale beside those a constitutional amendment would create; as legislators scrambled to evade it, they would harm their own reputations and demean the Constitution.
Why am I so sure Congress would evade the amendment? First, it is impossible to write an amendment that is not easily evaded. If Congress tired of imaginative accounting, it could issue regulations mandating that business and lower-level governments provide goods and services that might otherwise be financed through the budget. Second, it is evident, after watching Congress struggle with huge deficits for 10 years, that the will to balance the budget does not exist. If raising taxes largely solved the deficit problem, the required increase would be many times the increase resulting from the 1990 budget agreement. If cuts in spending mainly solved the problem, the goal could not be reached without dramatic cuts in Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, which together will constitute more than one-half of non-interest spending by the year 2000. The politically powerful elderly have easily thwarted cuts much smaller than those required.
A combination of tax increases and spending cuts would spread the sacrifice, but the decisions are so painful politicians have avoided debating them seriously. A cynic would say the renewal of interest in an amendment is a ploy to postpone debate further.
Some proponents of the amendment believe it would work; that assumption may be worse than an assumption that it would be impotent. The Government would raise taxes and cut spending during recessions, and programs would be turned on and off with every wiggle in tax revenues.
Some proposals for an amendment allow a 60 percent majority to approve deficit spending. It may be very difficult to break an impasse if a super-majority cannot be found to approve a deficit and a simple majority cannot be found to take the steps necessary for a balanced budget. In short, whether the amendment worked or did not work, it would be a disaster.

HEADLINE: Adam Smith Would Bless a Balanced Budget

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Unbalanced" (editorial, May 10) predicts terrible consequences if a constitutional amendment mandating a balanced budget were to be adopted. This prediction reminds one of a drug addict's forebodings about the harmful consequences that would supposedly follow in the wake of giving up the drug habit.
To place this matter in perspective, deficit spending as a deliberate Government policy was initiated by the Administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt to counteract the depression of the 1930's. At the time, the Government's finances were in excellent shape. This reality enabled the Government to borrow money at extremely low interest rates and to extend a helping hand to the private sector. 
 The realities confronting us today are quite different. The real operating budget deficit of the Government will exceed $500 billion in 1992. The Federal debt will reach $4 trillion before the end of this year. If the Government were a private entity, it would have been declared insolvent a long time ago. The only thing that stands between the Government and bankruptcy is the Federal Reserve's ability to create new money by fiat. However, this power is subject to limitations.
Most of the Government's debt is in private hands. If investors got the impression the Federal Reserve was creating excessive amounts of fiat money, they would likely lose faith in Government obligations. Bond prices would collapse and interest rates would soar. Under these conditions, the Government would have great difficulty raising new funds to pay for deficits and money would become increasingly worthless.
In effect, if the Government does not take rational actions to balance the budget, market forces will impose their own solution, which would be far more damaging to the economy than the proposed amendment.
I propose the following measures to balance the Federal budget over the next five years: (1) Cut defense spending in half, saving $150 billion annually; (2) raise the gasoline tax by 20 cents a year until it reaches $1 per gallon, which would increase Government revenues by $100 billion; (3) levy a temporary surcharge on estate taxes to pay for the savings and loan bailout, which would raise an estimated $50 billion annually, and (4) save $100 billion annually through reduced entitlement programs and the reduction of waste and inefficiency in Government.
We have a clear choice. A continuation of massive deficit spending will bankrupt the Government, jeopardize all private wealth, risk financial crises and runaway inflation, undermine the economy, endanger democracy, enrich foreigners at the expense of the American people and compromise the independence of the United States.
In contrast, balancing the Federal budget would put the country in a favorable position to solve its problems. This approach would reverse all the harmful consequences that have resulted from chronically huge budget deficits. It would lay the foundation for wealth creation by the private sector, in turn bringing greater prosperity to all Americans.
The proposed policy would constitute a return to classical economic thinking and orthodox financial policies, as valid today as they were two centuries ago when Adam Smith presented them in "The Wealth of Nations."

HEADLINE: 'I've Never Felt Like A Stranger at Home'

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Although I too am a Japanese-American, I found David Mura's "Bashed in the U.S.A." (Op-Ed, April 29) disturbing because his attitude about his heritage and looks is, and should be, far from universal among Japanese-Americans.
I am half nisei and half sansei (second- and third-generation Japanese-American). My Japanese mother was born an American citizen and was raised on a small farm in Utah. My father was born in Japan and came to the United States at age 9. In 1951, at 40, my father was naturalized as an American citizen. This was his lifelong dream despite having lost everything during World War II when he was treated as an enemy alien. 
 My parents proudly raised my brother, sister and me as Americans. As far as I am concerned, I look, act, feel and am perceived as 100 percent American. And I never considered drilling a friend, as Mr. Mura did of his "white friend," about his or her image of me as a Japanese. I've never felt like a "stranger at home."
Mr. Mura's article exhibits an insecurity and inferiority complex I have seen in other Japanese-Americans. Japanese-Americans must stop reinforcing this complex; they must stop wondering what other people think of them. They must also stop highlighting the negative behavior of other Americans; they must stop listening to the "Japan bashers."
I do agree with Mr. Mura that there is a need to educate Americans about the Japanese, their culture and business practices. More important, Americans need to understand ethnic groups of all kinds. Let us not be defensive; that only encourages division. Let us bring back the "united" in the United States, or we will surely lose our effectiveness in the growing global economy.

HEADLINE: Mexico Disaster Had Roots in Policy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The sewer explosions that killed more than 200 people, destroyed 1,422 homes, 450 businesses, 600 vehicles and turned Guadalajara, Mexico's second largest city, into a disaster area are just the tip of the iceberg.
Official unaccountability, negligence and macroeconomic mismanagement in Mexico are both chronic and rampant. As happened during the Chicago flood and the Los Angeles riots, governments seem to have no trouble in finding scapegoats at the municipal or even state levels. Mexico's attorney general has blamed local officials and the state-owned oil company, Pemex, for the explosions (news article, April 27). His investigation established that the loss of life could have been avoided if public officials had acted to evacuate residents from the area of highest risk. 
 Sadly this is true, but President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's Government is reluctant to address the disaster's underlying causes and to face its own responsibilities for the ailing oil sector. Pemex has had its budget slashed since 1987. Acceptance of International Monetary Fund and World Bank guidelines has meant that all of its net pretax profit of $36 billion during the last five years was sent to the Treasury, leaving the company financially depleted.
Thus, while Pemex now provides more than 30 percent of Government revenue, its oil and gas distribution system is shrinking. Since 1990 more than 125,000 workers who handle the nuts and bolts of the oil industry have been fired. Official sources report the transportation fleet went from an estimated capacity of 214,500 cubic meters to just 185,700 from 1990 to 1991, and the tanker truck fleet collapsed to its lowest level since 1981.
The national gas and oil pipeline distribution system is crumbling because there is no money for maintenance, much less for the required expansion. According to the United States Embassy in Mexico and the General Accounting Office, the accumulated lack of investment in Pemex over the last decade has created a major bottleneck that now impedes Mexican industrial development.
Perhaps it is more than just an irony, but while the Salinas administration weakens Pemex's infrastructure, the Bush Presidency exerts pressure for its privatization, while proposing huge tax breaks for our own oil and gas industry.
In the burning and devastated areas of Guadalajara, we daily experience the human and material impact of these senseless policies.

HEADLINE: New York State Colleges Need a Fiscal Pledge for the Future;
What's at Stake

 BODY:
To the Editor:
We cannot pretend to offer quality higher education through our state's public and private institutions without paying for it, one way or another, as your April 22 editorial "Higher Education -- or Lower?" indicates. State financing for higher education -- public and private -- is sadly out of sync with expectations for quality.
Even in these dire economic times, action is possible right now. We can begin immediately by formulating (at long last) a coherent, rational public policy for higher education. What's at stake is not simply the future of our colleges and universities. Hanging in the balance is the educated work force that the modern industrial economy requires -- and, more important, the future of our children.

Testimony
Henry Street Settlement's
Louis Abrons Arts Center
466 Grand Street
Lower Manhattan
 
By Safiya Henderson-Holmes; directed by Raina von Waldenburg; set, Nathan Jones; lighting, Marty Liquori. New Federal Theater, Woodie King Jr., producer, Shoestring Productions, Lynn K. Pannell, artistic director and producer.
WITH: Marty Liquori, Julie Bray-Morris, Mantee M. Murphy and Sonita Surratt.
There seems to be no bottom to the personal suffering caused by the racial animosity that Safiya Henderson-Holmes explores in her second play, "Testimony." 
 It is possible that the recent riots in Los Angeles give this play greater resonance. But one would guess this it would leave most people stunned and shocked even if the surface tranquillity of this troubled society had never been ripped apart. This young playwright is a poet who knows how to make words bite and gnaw.
The testimony of the title comes entirely from one young black woman, Jacintha (Sonita Surratt), being held in a New York City prison on a murder charge. A white psychiatrist (Julie Bray-Morris) is interviewing Jacintha. The session is audiotaped by a black technician (Mantee M. Murphy) while a white technician (Marty Liquori) makes a videotape that can be seen on two monitors, even though the interrogation frequently lunges beyond the gaze of the red eye.
Ms. Surratt meets a formidable acting challenge. Jacintha has several personalities, each with her own exquisitely devious program for concealing truth as a tale of appalling abuse and hopeless longing unfolds. The abuse comes from her mother, her employer, her neighbors -- the whole world, it seems -- and all of it is based on color. Ms. Surratt positively pulls the audience through this terrible labyrinth with her.
Ms. Henderson-Holmes still has things to learn about playwriting, mostly about economy. Her faults are those of generous youth: she tries to include everything imaginable about all her characters, and at times her story wanders beyond the attention of even the most alert audience. The director, Raina von Waldenburg, has a hard job trying to hold it all together. But Ms. Henderson-Holmes can surely write, passionately; her characters speak with absolute conviction, and often nobly, even when they mean to evade or deceive.

HEADLINE: Dial Direct To Moscow And Beyond

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
The former Soviet Union, which only last year could receive fewer telephone calls from beyond its borders than a medium-size Manhattan apartment building, got direct-dial service yesterday to more than 2,000 cities in 15 republics. For the first time, calls from the United States do not need the help of an American operator and are not shuffled through the inefficient and sternly monitored lines in Moscow.
But the former Soviet Union still has relatively few lines, antiquated equipment, some of which predates the 1917 Revolution, and is hemmed in by restrictions by the West on how much and what kind of advanced equipment it can buy. For these reasons, the new republics will still only have the telephone abilities of a large Manhattan apartment building.
 
Many Calls Don't Get Through
 There are now 421 international long-distance circuits, quadruple the number only nine months ago, when the former Soviet Union had 91 circuits, enough for only 91 simultaneous conversations. In A.T.& T.'s Network Operating Center in Bedminster, N.J., which monitors the world's telephone traffic, the first three letters of Moscow on a map of the world are permanently lighted in red, indicating that a large number of calls cannot get through. 
 "Telecommunications is vitally important to the Soviet economy," said Donald H. Morrison, A.T.& T.'s regional managing director with responsibility for the former Soviet Union. "It is an accelerator and the lack of it is a brake." Mr. Morrison spoke in a telephone interview yesterday from Amsterdam, on his way to Moscow to negotiate new telecommunications agreements.
Domestic long-distance and local service is not much better.
There are perhaps 200 million or more traditional and cellular telephones dispersed throughout the United States, with a population of 250 million. By contrast, there are 40 million poorly operating telephones in the new republics, with a population of 290 million. Most of the phones are in Moscow, St. Petersburg and a few other cities.
In Moscow, only 40 percent of local and long-distance phone calls are completed, compared with more than 99 percent in the United States. In other big cities of the ex-Soviet Union, and especially the smaller towns, the completion rate falls even lower.
Depending on demand, which is expected to total millions of attempted calls a day, Americans will still find it difficult to get through and will get a recording advising them to call back later because all circuits are busy.
While phone calls to the former Soviet republics are still expensive, they will no longer carry the operator charges of $3 for station-to-station calls or $6 for person-to-person calls.
 
Range of Rates
 Rates will range from economy periods, or 2 A.M. to 7 A.M. in the various time zones of the United States, to discount periods, or 7 A.M. to 1 P.M., to standard periods, or 1 P.M. to 2 A.M. The charges are based on when networks are busiest in the United States, typically daylight hours for businesses and evening hours for consumers. The economy period will cover daylight hours in Moscow and most big cities, which are 7 hours ahead of New York and 10 hours ahead of San Francisco.
A 10-minute economy call will thus cost $15.65 and a standard call $20.34. The old rates were the same, but calls were more expensive because of the operator surcharges.
As recently as 1987, A.T.& T., the only big international carrier in the region, had only 16 long-distance circuits, enough for 16 conversations. Nine months ago, it had 91, 24 of which were granted on an Eastern bloc communications satellite.
The bulk of the additional circuits, 180, are in the Armenian republic, with the remainder on Intersputnik, an Eastern bloc satellite, and in land lines in Moscow, St. Petersburg and Ukraine. Leased lines from eight other countries, including France and Australia, also help to complete the network.
 
More Lines Are Planned
 A.T.& T. has plans to add several hundred circuits by the end of the year and would like to add as many as 1,600 circuits as soon as the authorities in Russia and the other republics permit. A great deal of the problem, however, is in paying for the equipment with scarce hard currency.
In Armenia, however, the authorities pay for A.T.& T. equipment and services through charging A.T.& T. for completing incoming calls over the Armenian local network. And to help modernize telecommunications, Russia, as well as the other republics, is seeking foreign partners and financing that does not require hard currency.
In March, an international organization appeared headed toward a relaxation of export controls to the former Soviet Union, but only weeks before a June 1 meeting in Paris of the group, the relaxation is in doubt. Agreement within the group, the Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls, or Cocom, appears to be foundering because of a disagreement among countries over the exact kind of telecommunications equipment that can be sold in the ex-Soviet Union.
 
High-Capacity Lines
 For example, Western countries may sell Russia fiber-optic lines able of carrying 45 million bits of information a second, or at least 2,800 conversations, but can sell China more advanced fiber-optic lines capable of carrying 140 million bits, or nearly 9,000 conversations. By contrast, United States companies can use equipment with two-billion-bit capacity or more.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 25, 1992, Monday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Wednesday about direct-dial telephone service to former Soviet republics omitted one carrier that provides it. In addition to the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, with 421 long-distance circuits, the Sprint Corporation has supplied 23 international direct-dial circuits since January in conjunction with the IDB Communications Group.

HEADLINE: U.S. Caps Amount Of Interest Offered By Weakest Banks

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 20

 BODY:
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation placed new limits today on the rates that the nation's weaker banks and savings and loans can offer customers. The move, a step toward reregulating interest rates, will make it easier for strong banks to grow and harder for some weak banks to survive.
The new rules, which stem from a banking law passed by Congress in 1991, separate the nation's 14,370 banks and savings and loans into three classes, based on their ability to absorb losses. Only the financially healthiest institutions will be allowed to pay whatever interest rates they choose, which will mean less competition for deposits and far fewer -- if any -- opportunities for savers to find exceptionally high rates paid by some banks and savings and loans. 
 The effect of the rules, which will take effect June 16, will bar the weakest banks and savings and loans from bidding up interest rates to attract deposits. That was a common practice in the 1980's, when tiny savings and loans grew by paying premiums for deposits that allowed them to make bigger and riskier loans. The tactic engendered a "hot money" market in which individual deposits and those collected by brokers chased the highest rates in the country.
The practice helped cause the savings crisis to snowball. As loan losses mounted, some savings and loans kept bidding up interest rates to attract deposits in order to stay afloat. As they delayed their demise, losses continued driving up the cost of the savings bailout.
Banking officials said today's decision was significant because the new classifications for the nation's banks might be used by regulators to determine which financial institutions would pay higher premiums for Federal deposit insurance, along the lines of a recent proposal by the F.D.I.C. The categories may also determine the banks that might someday be allowed to expand into the securities or insurance businesses.
"We feel this decision is very significant," said Christopher Reick, a spokesman for the American Bankers Association. "It will have future implications on all kinds of other issues."
C. C. Hope, a member of the F.D.I.C. board, protested the new rules, saying it would be improper for the agency to take the weighty step of getting back into the business of regulating interest rates. Interest rate ceilings on savings accounts were largely removed in the early 1980's and totally phased out in 1986.
F.D.I.C. officials estimated today that 8,900, or more than 72 percent, of the nation's 12,300 commercial banks would be classified as well capitalized; 3,000, or 24 percent, as adequately capitalized, and 400, or 3 percent, as undercapitalized.
 
Banks Not Named
 Of the nation's 2,070 savings and loans, 1,150 of them, or just 56 percent, would be categorized as well capitalized; 580, or 28 percent, as adequately capitalized and 330, or 16 percent, as undercapitalized. Individual institutions were not named. The F.D.I.C. said a higher percentage of banks in the American heartland would be classified as well capitalized because they traditionally have been very careful about their capital bases.
Under the rules, the weakest, or undercapitalized, institutions will be barred from using brokers as well as offering high rates, while a middle tier of institutions that meet minimum capital standards set by regulators will be able to use brokers or offer higher-than-average interest rates only if they receive a waiver from the F.D.I.C.
According to the F.D.I.C., 800 of the nation's 12,300 commercial banks and 260 of the 2,070 savings and loans now accept brokered deposits. Under current rules, undercapitalized institutions can receive a waiver to accept brokered or high-interest-rate deposits, but once the new rules go into effect they will be unable to do so. F.D.I.C. officials estimate that 90 undercapitalized banks and 65 savings and loans that now use brokered deposits will have to stop accepting them.
F.D.I.C. officials acknowledge that the new rules may drive some weak savings and loans under and force the Federal Government to step in and run them. But these officials say Congress wanted the F.D.I.C. to make sure that banks and savings and loans abandoned the unhealthy practice of living off costly brokered money.
 
Experts Defend Move
 Banking experts said it was not unwise or unhealthy to allow well-capitalized banks to use brokered or high-interest deposits. The new rules will give well-capitalized banks greater flexibility to expand than other banks.
The rules define well-capitalized banks as those with capital exceeding 10 percent of their risk-adjusted assets and whose core capital, or money paid in for common stock, exceeds 5 percent of their total assets. In addition, well-capitalized banks cannot have been classified as troubled by Federal regulators.
In determining a bank's capital adequacy, regulators weigh the riskiness of a bank's loans or other assets. Thus, when a bank holds safe assets, like Government securities, it might be required to hold less capital reserves as compared with capital required for riskier real estate loans.
The definition of a well-capitalized bank is considerably more stringent than that of the 1988 agreement signed in Basel, Switzerland, setting capital adequacy standards for the world's banks. Under that agreement a well-capitalized bank must have capital equal to at least 8 percent of its risk-adjusted assets.
The rules also state that an undercapitalized bank or savings and loan is one that fails to meet the minimum capital requirement of its principal Federal regulator. Generally, then, an institution will be classified as undercapitalized if its capital is less than 8 percent of its risk-adjusted assets.
Under the new rules, an adequately capitalized institution would have capital that represents 8 to 10 percent of its risk-adjusted assets.
 
Complaints by Banks
 Many American banks have complained in light of the nation's long recession and loan losses from the depressed real estate market that the capital rules were making it difficult for them to grow.
Commenting on today's announcement, an official at a large New York City bank who spoke on the condition of anonymity said, "The worrisome thing to us is the effect that continuously more stringent capital definitions can have on the efficient operation of the United States financial system and its international competitiveness."
Under the new rules, well-capitalized institutions may pay whatever interest rates they choose.
But an adequately capitalized bank or savings and loan may not, without a waiver, accept or renew deposits that exceed by more than half a percentage point the effective yield paid on deposits of comparable size and maturity in its market area. Thus, if the local rate on savings accounts averages 4 percent, the bank or savings and loan may pay up to 4.5 percent.
For deposits from outside its market area, an adequately capitalized institution may not, without a waiver, pay interest of more than half a percentage point above the national rate. That rate is to be determined by adding one percentage point to "the current yield of similar-maturity U.S. Treasury obligations."
For example, if a six-month Treasury bill pays 4 percent interest, the national rate on a six-month certificate of deposit would be 5 percent and the adequately capitalized institution could pay at most 5.5 percent. For accounts of more than double the $100,000 federally insured limit, the national rate would be one and a half percentage points above the yield of a comparable Treasury security.
According to the rules, if the interest rate paid on comparable Treasury securities exceeds 10 percent, the national rate will be 1.5 percentage points above that. For deposits exceeding $200,000, the national rate would be 2 percentage points above the Treasury rate.
Undercapitalized institutions are even more restricted. They may accept deposits only when their yield does not exceed by more than half a percentage point the prevailing yield of insured deposits of comparable maturity in the institution's local area.

HEADLINE: AID PLAN DRAFTED FOR ATOMIC SAFETY IN EASTERN EUROPE

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: VIENNA, May 20

 BODY:
President Bush and the leaders of the other six major industrial democracies are expected to endorse a multibillion-dollar plan for improving the safety of nuclear reactors in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe at their economic summit meeting in Munich in early July.
The plan, which is being prepared with advice from officials at the International Atomic Energy Agency here, would provide for refitting of some reactors with more modern safety features, the closing down of those considered too unsafe to be worth saving and the provision of alternative sources of electricity, including supplies from Western Europe, according to diplomats and agency officials here.
 
Billions to Prevent Catastrophe
 Estimates of the cost of such a program, which is designed to prevent another nuclear catastrophe like the one in Chernobyl, vary from $10 billion to $20 billion. The idea is to find this money over several years from a number of sources, including direct government grants, guaranteed government loans and loans from such development institutions as the World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the European Community's European Investment Bank. 
 Germany's Environment Minister, Klaus Topfer, said last month that the cost of such an assistance program would be around $9 billion. The United States has told the International Atomic Energy Agency that it might cost between $11 billion and $20 billion.
"At present it looks 90 percent certain the Munich summit will back the program and we hope this agency will provide its secretariat in partnership with the Brussels Commission of the European Community," said Morris Rosen, Assistant Deputy Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency and head of its Nuclear Safety Division.
 
Concern Over Safety
 The so-called Group of Seven countries -- which, besides the United States, includes Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan -- first expressed concern about the safety of nuclear reactors in East Europe and the Soviet Union at their 1989 Paris meeting, three years after the Cher nobyl disaster. Last year, at their London meeting, they urged Western countries to help raise safety standards in the former Communist world.
After the appeal at the London meeting, the so-called Group of 24, a body set up by all Western industrialized countries to coordinate aid to the former Communist world, created a special working group to examine the nuclear safety problem in cooperation with the Brussels Commission of the European Community.
But while this led to several Western governments offering help to Eastern countries to make their reactors safer, officials at the atomic energy agency said the aid is uncoordinated, duplicative and far less effective than the program they expect to be approved at the Munich meeting.
 
Companies Need Orders
 Just how specific a commitment the Group of Seven countries will give to make the East's nuclear power industry safer still remains uncertain.
[In Washington, a Congressional expert on nuclear energy voiced support for such a plan. Representative Norman D. Dicks, Democrat of Washington and a member of the House Appropriations Committee, said he believed the Bush Administration should do more "to work with the Soviets regarding their unsafe reactors."
["This is more serious than dismantling nuclear weapons," Representative Dicks said. "We can get a lot of support for this in the Congress."]
Officials of the atomic energy agency said such a program for the former Communist world's nuclear power industry would also be attractive for American and European nuclear companies, which are starved for new orders because of environmental opposition to nuclear power and the fact that the low price of oil and gas currently makes nuclear-generated electricity relatively expensive.
France, which has invested more heavily in nuclear power than other industrialized countries, is especially anxious for contracts to upgrade East Europe's reactors. But Germany's nuclear industry has been hit as well by that country's ecological movement.
Speaking in Budapest last month, the head of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Jacques Attali, said the international community should "mobilize itself in order not only to finance the closing of the most dangerous nuclear power plants, but also to bring together the human and technological resources needed to rehabilitate that portion of the stock of nuclear power plants which can be brought up to a satisfactory safety level." He said the bank would be ready to take part in lending operations up to some $4 billion for this purpose.
Germany and France are leading the drive for such a campaign, warning that another nuclear disaster like one at Chernobyl would deal a devastating blow to public confidence in nuclear power around the world and further cripple the West's nuclear industry.
"We must protect Western nuclear investment by making sure there is no catastrophic accident in the East," Mr. Topfer, the German Environment Minister, told the Japan Atomic Industrial Forum in Yokohama in April.
 
Safety Standards Urged
 Germany is also pushing for a new international convention that would set obligatory reactor safety standards replacing existing national norms. Experts said the German plan would effectively close most, if not all, existing Soviet-designed power reactors.
But the experts said that shutting down the former Communist world's Soviet-designed power reactors temporarily to make them safer or closing these plants altogether will be difficult to organize because these countries are heavily dependent on nuclear-generated electricity. Hungary gets 50 percent of its power from nuclear reactors while Bulgaria gets 35.7 percent, Czechoslovakia 28.4 percent and the territories of the former Soviet Union 12.2 percent.
Reactors that cannot be made substantially safer are likely to be replaced with other fossil fuel power plants, which are far cheaper to build. But Czechoslovakia has already said it wants to replace its Soviet reactors with safer Western ones if it can find the money because it does not wish to increase pollution by burning more of its own brown coal.
The officials of the Group of Seven countries who prepare the annual economic summit meetings have created a special subcommittee to draft a declaration on nuclear safety in the East. It met in Cologne earlier this week.
 
16 Chernobyl Reactors
 The territories of the former Soviet Union have 16 large graphite reactors of the kind that exploded at Chernobyl. The atomic energy agency considers the safety of these reactors "a matter of great international concern."
Reactors of the type used at Chernobyl currently provide 47.8 percent of the nuclear-generated electricity in the countries of the former Soviet Union.
The continuing deficiences of these reactors were highlighted a few weeks ago when a reactor of this type near the major Russian city of St. Petersburg sprang a leak that resulted in a small quantity of radioactive material escaping into the atmosphere.
Soviet-designed reactors of all types make up 11 percent of the world's operating reactors and 32 percent of those currently under construction, according to a new study by the atomic energy agency. Of the pressurized water reactors, which are known as W.W.E.R.'s and are the only type to have been exported by the Soviet Union, there are a total of 41 in operation and 31 more under construction.
All of the W.W.E.R. reactors, the agency said, "lack important safety features which are basic to similar pressurized water reactors in the West." Their weaknesses include lack of a containment system to prevent accidental radioactive emissions from leaking into the atmosphere as well as deficient controls and insufficient fire protection.
 
10 Still in Operation
 The least safe reactors, in the atomic energy agency's view, are the first generation pressurized water reactors known as W.W.E.R.-230's. Ten of these early reactors are still in operation. Four of them are in Russia, two near the Finnish border, four more are in Bulgaria and two are in Czechoslovakia.
The former East Germany had four of these reactors, but after reunification the Bonn Government ordered them permanently closed for safety reasons, replacing the lost power without difficulty from plants in the western half of Germany. Armenia also closed its reactors of this type when it became independent, citing safety considerations and saying they had also been built in a region where earthquakes occur.
Last year the agency recommended that Bulgaria permanently close its four W.W.E.R.-230's. But the Sofia Government refused, saying it could not accept the electricity shortages this would create. But it has agreed to shut down two of them temporarily while new safety features are installed.
In its new report, the atomic agency reckons that the 10 functioning W.W.E.R.-230's together have about 50 serious safety faults, which would cost some $200 million to $400 million per reactor to rectify. They also have 50 other less serious safety defects, which would cost an additional $50 million per reactor to resolve.
A later generation of the same reactor, called the W.W.E.R.-213, is considered safer but still needs more modern instruments and other improvements, the agency said. Finland, which has two, has already made these changes, introducing German technology. But Russia, Hungary and Czechoslovakia, with a total of 14 among them, have not yet done so.
Two reactors of this type are also under construction in Cuba.
A 1,000-megawatt version of the W.W.E.R. is considered by the agency to incorporate relatively good safety features, which would probably contain any radioactive leak.

HEADLINE: Macy Says It Will Close 8 Stores, Including 4 in the New York Area

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
R. H. Macy & Company said yesterday that it would close eight department stores, including four in the New York region, by Aug. 1 as part of its effort to restore the financial health of its bankrupt business.
Macy's departures will leave many neighborhoods bereft of department stores that served as the centerpieces of once-thriving urban hubs like the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, downtown Newark and Main Street in Columbia, S.C. 
 In addition to those stores, the company is shutting Macy's stores in New Rochelle, N.Y.,; Plainfield, N.J.,; Cockeysville, Md., near Baltimore, and Avondale, Ga., near Atlanta. It will also close one of the department stores in its Bullock's chain, in La Habra, Calif. About 1,850 employees will be affected by the closings, but Macy said it would work to find jobs elsewhere in the company for as many of them as possible.
 
Reaction by Civic Officials
 Although Macy, which also operates the I. Magnin department store chain, had warned that it would close a handful of its less profitable stores, some officials in the affected cities and communities said yesterday that they were surprised and saddened by the announcement.
The decision also means that in less than a week the New York region has essentially lost 15 department stores.Alexander's Inc. closed its 11 stores last Friday.
Economic analysts said the blight among the area's traditional merchants was reaching a crisis and damaging New York's cachet as the capital of the global retail industry.
 
'Detrimental Impact'
 "Grand stores are still part of the world image for New York," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. "The turmoil going on in the retail industry has an especially detrimental impact here because it tarnishes that image."
The concerns were similar in other cities.
"Macy's was the last large department store downtown," said John Bowers, manager of government affairs for the Greater Columbia Chamber of Commerce. "It's just going to add to the perception here and everywhere, really, that Main Street is unhealthy."
Some of the stores being closed are among a handful of large retailers that remained in inner-city neighborhoods long after their most affluent shoppers fled to the suburbs. And since several of the stores serve largely black and Hispanic neighborhoods, some retail analysts, who refused to be named, said the closings could be construed as having racial overtones.
In response, a Macy official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said, "Macy continues to operate stores in major urban areas and is the only retail company to operate stores in all five boroughs of New York." He added that a high proportion of Macy's 65,000 employees nationally are from minority groups. The closings will leave the company with 112 stores across the country.
Macy also plans to build or lease new stores in the downtown areas of Pittsburgh, Denver and Providence, R.I.
The Newark Macy's opened in 1928 as Bamberger's, the flagship of what became a large New Jersey chain. The chain was bought by the Macy company, which kept operating it as Bamberger's before eventually changing the stores' names to Macy's.
 
Reasons Given by Macy
 In its statement on the stores being closed, Macy cited declining sales, poor growth potential in the markets they served and the need for costly renovations and improvements as among the reasons for giving up on them.
Macy has other stores that have not done well during the recession but believes that those stores have stronger potential for recovery when the economy rebounds, people familiar with the company's strategy said.
Judge Burton R. Lifland of the Federal Bankruptcy Court, who is presiding over Macy's bankruptcy case, and Macy's creditors would have to agree formally to the store closings but were not expected to object.
"We thought there had to be some store closings, and these stores were logical ones to close," said Robert M. Miller, partner at Berlack, Israels & Liberman, the law firm representing Macy's bondholders.
 
Customers' Memories
 Others were more nostalgic, dredging up childhood memories of wandering the stores' wide aisles on Saturday afternoons and playing on the rickety wooden escalators that became a hallmark of some of Macy's older stores.
Customers like Naomi Fisch remembered how she had eagerly awaited the annual back-to-school shopping spree at the Macy's on Flatbush Avenue, which opened in 1948.
Ms. Fisch, an account manager at a large marketing-support company in New Jersey, recalled using a gift certificate she had received upon her graduation from eighth grade to purchase a brown suede handbag.
"It was twice as much as I had ever spent on a bag before, but I had that gift certificate and I just loved that bag," she said. "I carried it for years. I wonder what ever happened to it."
 
Effect of Kings Plaza Opening
 But then Macy opened a big, modern new store in Kings Plaza, only five miles from the Flatbush store but light years away in terms of atmosphere, convenience and space. And when Ms. Fisch moved to Hillsboro, N.J., 10 years ago, she found an even newer, nicer Macy's store to shop at.
"Macy's signed its own death warrant on Flatbush Avenue when it opened Kings Plaza," Ms. Fisch said. "Why would you go to a small, rinky-dink department store when you could go to a mall, which had Macy's plus lots of other stores -- and it had parking."
Ms. Fisch's memories tell the story behind almost all the store closings Macy announced yesterday. As people left the city and moved to the suburbs, retailers set up shop there, too. As Macy's suburban stores contributed more and more to the retailer's bottom line, more and more of the money Macy spent for renovations and modernizations was spent on those stores.
 
2.6% of Company Sales
 In 1991, the eight stores Macy is closing had revenues of about $175 million, or just 2.6 percent of the company's total sales of $6.7 billion. "These were small stores, and they have gotten less and less profitable as the suburbs grew," said Walter F. Loeb, a retail consultant who once worked at the Macy's on Flatbush Avenue. "Today, Macy is used to running $60 million stores at the least."
He said Macy might still close a few other stores, although the company has said there will be no further store closings. It has already announced the closing of five I. Magnin stores and 57 other specialty outlets.
In some of the cities where the company will close a store, Macy's was the last major department store in the downtown area. Macy's has been the only major department store in New Rochelle since Bloomingdale's left 15 years ago, and community leaders worried about the impact the store's closing would have on a 28-store mall at the intersection of Le Count Place and Main Street.
"It's a definite blow to the economy here," said Robert J. Streger, president of the New Rochelle Chamber of Commerce.
But he said local business people were not surprised. Rumors that the store might close had circulated since Macy filed for bankruptcy protection on Jan. 27 and announced it would close some stores. Macy's newer, larger store in White Plains had siphoned off business from the New Rochelle store for some time.

Money Market Fund Yields Show Mixed Trend in Week

 BODY:
Yields offered by money market funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report were mixed in the latest reporting week, with tax-exempt yields falling while taxable yields were unchanged.
The tax-exempt yields fell for the second straight week. Walter K. Frank, the chief economist at Donoghue's, said that it was possible that rates could rise just a little in the weeks ahead. This is because the recent fall was in anticipation by many analysts of a cut in official interest rates by the Federal Reserve. But Mr. Frank said that he did not expect the Fed to cut rates in the near term. 
 The seven-day compounded average yield for tax-exempt funds fell by 4 basis points, to 3.08 percent in the latest reporting week. The simple yield also dropped 4 basis points, to 3.03 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
 
Higher Long-Term Yields
 In the same period, the 30-day compounded average yield rose 6 basis points, to 3.14 percent, and the 30-day simple yield increased by 5 basis points, to 3.09 percent.
Donoghue's said the average number of days left to maturity of securities held in tax-exempt portfolios dropped by a day, to 52 days.
In its weekly survey of tax-exempt funds with assets greater than $100 million, Donoghue's said that the Fidelity Spartan Municipal Money Fund offered the best return, at 3.97 percent. The fund's distributor is the Fidelity Distributors Corporation of Boston.
Donoghue's reported that the assets of taxable money market funds rose by $1.1 billion in the week that ended Tuesday, to $492.8 billion. Institutional assets grew by $1.7 billion, to $165.9 billion, while retail assets fell by $600 million, to $326.9 billion.
 
7-Day Taxables Unchanged
 The average seven-day taxable compounded yield was unchanged at 3.57 percent, and the simple yield was also unchanged, at 3.51 percent. For the 30-day compounded average, the yield was 3.61 percent, down 2 basis points, with the simple yield down 3 basis points, to 3.54 percent.
The Olde Premium Plus Money Market Series repeated again as the best performer, with a return of 4.41 percent, down 4 basis points from its best yield last week. The fund is distributed by the Olde Discount Corporation of Detroit.
By comparison, the average bank money market account, a prime competitor of the money funds, is yielding 3.44 percent.

HEADLINE: Man Pleads Guilty In Smuggling Case

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRIDGEPORT, Conn., May 20

 BODY:
A former South African military officer pleaded guilty today in Federal District Court here to a single charge stemming from a smuggling operation that brought rhinoceros horns and the heads and skins of other endangered species into the United States.
The plea by Marius Meiring, 44 years old, once the second-highest ranking South African Defense Force officer in Namibia, ends a case that started with a sting operation conducted in part by United States wildlife and firearms agents in 1988. 
 Conservationists have said that the case is important because it sheds light on a thriving underground economy that threatens the black rhinoceros with extinction.
Powdered rhinoceros horn is prized as a medicine and an aphrodisiac in East Asia and other markets, including some in the United States, where it reportedly has sold for as much as $2,500 per kilogram. In the Connecticut case involving Mr. Meiring and nine others, including the officer's wife, a single horn was purchased by Federal agents for $30,000.
Conservation officials hope that Mr. Meiring's expected cooperation with law-enforcement agencies will lead to further inquiries into what they believe is complicity in poaching and smuggling among South African Defense Force officers and government officials in southern Africa.
The smuggling began with South African soldiers procuring rhinoceros horns, as well as automatic rifles, during recent wars in Namibia and Angola, according to court documents. South African military vehicles were used to ship horns from Angola to Namibia, prosecutors say.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Greeted as a Friend In the Dominican Republic

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Re public, May 20

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins took his Caribbean campaign to the Dominican Republic today, where he received a rousing welcome from the leaders and people of this nation, which has the fastest-growing immigrant population in New York City.
For today, at least, it appeared that Mr. Dinkins had left his highly publicized problems with Hispanic leaders and citizens behind in Puerto Rico, where for two days he was accused of political opportunism. 
 In sharp contrast to Puerto Rican leaders' stiff criticism that Mayor Dinkins is insensitive to their needs, Dominican leaders here and in New York said in interviews that they fully support Mr. Dinkins because he has helped their expanding community in New York.
Last night, the Mayor of Santo Domingo, Rafael Corporan de los Santos, announced his endorsement of Mr. Dinkins for re-election for next year. "Because Mayor Dinkins is so concerned with the fate of Dominicans in New York, it obligates me to endorse him."
 
Serious Remaining Problems
 Specifically, the Dominican leaders said Mr. Dinkins had announced new health-care programs last month in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan, which has the largest concentration of Dominicans in the United States. The Mayor has also appointed Dominicans to high positions in his administration and has invited community leaders to take part in city planning sessions, the leaders said.
But equally important, the leaders said, is that Mr. Dinkins, who is black, serves as an important role model for Dominicans, who are of African, European and Indian descent.
"We feel very different about the Mayor than most other Hispanic groups," said Dr. Rafael Lantigua, director of the National Council of Dominican Americans, a nonprofit advocacy group for Dominican New Yorkers. "We like him because Mr. Dinkins has been a friend of the Dominican community, and it makes us proud to have an African-American as Mayor."
But Dr. Lantigua, who is a professor of medicine at the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University, said Dominicans were still plagued by serious problems like health care, housing, education and unemployment, and that he hoped Mr. Dinkins would learn of those issues during his visit here.
While Mr. Dinkins will spend a little more than 24 hours in this nation of six million people, the Mayor plans to meet with President Joaquin Balaguer, attend a reception in his honor at the American Embassy, visit a children's hospital and receive an honorary degree from the Universidad Autonoma de Santo Domingo.
It is estimated that 350,000 to 500,000 people of Dominican ancestry live in New York City, mainly in upper Manhattan. About 20,000 Dominicans immigrate legally to New York each year.
 
'He Cared Enough to Stop By'
 Mr. Dinkins said at a meeting with reporters, "If I can better understand the needs of and the challenges faced by the Dominican people during my short stay here, upon my return to New York I can work to build a government which better serves those of your fathers and mothers, sons and daughters, who have graced my city with their talents."
Beatrice Cruz, a foster mother who was returning to the Dominican Republic from visiting her three sisters in New York, clapped her hands when she saw Mayor Dinkins enter the airline terminal.
"It's wonderful that he cared enough to stop by and see us," she said.

HEADLINE: Director Admits C.I.A. Fell Short In Predicting the Soviet Collapse

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 20

 BODY:
Responding to criticism that the Central Intelligence Agency failed to forecast the collapse of the Soviet system, its director, Robert M. Gates, today conceded shortcomings in the agency's analysis, but defended its overall performance over the years.
In a speech to the Foreign Policy Association in New York, Mr. Gates, the Director of Central Intelligence, said that although the agency wrote many assessments describing a growing crisis in the Soviet Union, it was not until 1989 that agency analysts began "to think that the entire edifice might well collapse." 
 Mr. Gates also acknowledged that the agency's statistical analysis portrayed a stronger and larger economy than the one that existed in reality. "From a personal standpoint," he added, "I would contend also that our quantitative analysis always considerably understated the real burden economically of the Soviet military."
During his confirmation hearings last fall, Mr. Gates was widely criticized for having promoted a view of an expansionist, invulnerable Soviet Union in more than a dozen speeches and articles between 1986 and 1988, when he was a senior C.I.A. official. The agency was also faulted for exaggerating the economic and military strength of the Soviet Union.
Adm. Stansfield Turner, who was Director of Central Intelligence from 1977 to 1981, complained in an article last year in the journal Foreign Affairs about "revisionist rumblings that the C.I.A. did in fact see the Soviet collapse emerging after all."
"On this one," Admiral Turner added, "the corporate view missed by a mile."
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, who wrote in 1979 that the Soviet Union would break up in the 1980's, has called for the dissolution of the agency. The Senate and House intelligence committees have introduced bills calling for sweeping reorganization of the entire intelligence apparatus of the Government.
But Mr. Gates, citing hundreds of assessments, briefings and monographs produced over the last three decades, maintained that the C.I.A. had accurately described the weaknesses of the Soviet Union, including the economic distortion from its extraordinary investment in the military.

Anxious Days for Bush's Campaign As G.O.P. Heads Into a 3-Way Race

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 20

 BODY:
Few Republicans would trade their troubles for the Democrats', but these are anxious days in the President's party.
Most of the Republican scripts for this election have not been working. The economy is recovering, but only sluggishly, and the President's job approval rating is moving even less. 
 The Democrats have produced a bruised and little-known likely nominee, which Republicans generally count on, but President Bush is also faced with a powerful and healthy third force in Ross Perot. Mr. Bush found it necessary last weekend to predict that he would carry his adopted state of Texas, an almost poignant display of bravado toward Mr. Perot, the Dallas billionaire.
The Republican Party is headed into the uncharted wilds of a three-way race with polls showing almost 60 percent of Americans supporting someone other than the incumbent President of the United States. The national mood is bleak, even bleaker in the aftermath of the riots in Los Angeles, some polls suggest.
 
As the Numbers Turn
 In short, Republicans have known for some time that this campaign would not be "morning in America," Ronald Reagan's triumphant march toward re-election. But it is turning out to be darker and harder than many of them had imagined.
"The most salient fact and dangerous fact is that the economy has turned and the perception of the economy is turning, and the President's numbers didn't turn," said one Republican strategist. "They kept going down. That's scary. Denial, which is the natural first reaction to this thing, is giving way to serious concern -- at both the campaign and the White House."
Another Republican strategist, who like others spoke only on condition that he not be identified, expressed another growing worry in the party: All their years of experience, all their targeting and all their blueprints are based on a two-way race.
That is their premise for directing resources to key states and putting together an Electoral College majority. It is the basis for such tried-and-true strategies as driving up the negatives of a Democratic nominee without worrying that the defecting voters will turn to a relatively unsullied third candidate, a common occurrence in three-way statewide races.
 
Conventional Wisdom Is Out
 "It's a terrible, terrible kind of campaign to run," the Republican strategist said. "Almost every state becomes somewhat competitive. And all the conventional wisdom about how you target and how you run a Presidential race is useless."
Still, much of the immediate concern in Republican circles is over Mr. Bush himself and his stall in the polls. The New York Times/CBS News Poll showed him with a 40 percent job approval rating in February, ominous but perhaps understandable amid an ugly primary challenge from Patrick J. Buchanan and a painful economic downtown.
But three months later, in early May, Mr. Bush was still at 39 percent; by way of contrast, President Jimmy Carter had an approval rating of 43 percent in May 1980, when he was seeking re-election, and President Ronald Reagan was at 52 percent at a comparable time in 1984, according to the Gallup Poll.
Moreover, some polls in the last few weeks have shown Mr. Bush losing ground after the rioting in Los Angeles.
The President himself, in an interview with The Dallas Morning News last weekend, seemed to cling to the belief that a rising economy would lift all boats, including his. "I've been through all this stuff before," he said. "My confidence is predicated on the fact, I must say, that I think the economy is recovering.'
But some analysts argue that Mr. Bush is buffeted by forces bigger than the business cycle -- a sense of national drift, of a struggling middle class, of a government that does not work as it should.
Kevin Phillips, the conservative theoretician who is one of the principal advocates of this view, asserts: "Americans are not looking at this as one economic cycle. They're looking at this as the unraveling of the American Dream."
In a poll conducted May 4-6 and made public this week, the Wirthlin Group found that 14 percent said the country was moving in the right direction, while 83 percent said it was on the wrong track. That was the highest level of pessimism recorded in 12 years, said the group's political project director, Michael Dabadie.
The group tied these findings, in part, to the riots in Los Angeles, but it was also part of a bleak pattern throughout 1992, Mr. Dabadie said.
This is hard terrain for any incumbent President to campaign on, and Mr. Bush reflected those difficulties as he traveled last weekend, delivering commencement addresses at Southern Methodist University and the University of Notre Dame.
At S.M.U. he gave a defiantly upbeat speech, railing against the "declinists" and asserting, "I'm a little tired of the pessmism in this country." It was reminiscent of the way Mr. Reagan used to poke at the "gloom and doom Democrats," but "gloom and doom" was not a majority view in Mr. Reagan's glory years.
At Notre Dame, Mr. Bush sat and listened as the valedictorian, a young woman, assailed the state of the nation, from its race relations to its environmental policies. When his turn came to speak the President never acknowledged her, talking instead of family values and the limits of what government can do.
There is considerable grumbling among Republicans about the President's message and campaign themes these days. Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, a conservative who is the House Republican whip, argues that the President needs to combine dramatic action with powerful words, to fulfill "the pedagogical burden" of the Presidency as Mr. Reagan did, or as Mr. Bush himself did in the events leading to the Persian Gulf war.
 
Playing to the Middle
 Mr. Gingrich contended that the President keeps trying to play to the middle, between the "elite" culture and the "popular" culture that he so "brilliantly" mined in his 1988 campaign.
Other Republicans worry that Mr. Bush is simply frustrated and ill at ease in a campaign focused unremittingly on domestic problems. "Here's a good and decent man who believes he has flat nailed it, long term, in terms of preserving the peace, and his political fortunes have declined at the same time," said one Bush strategist.
Still other Republicans fear that what the Democrats argue may be right: that the opposition to Mr. Bush is not just discontent or economic unease, but increasingly personal. Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic polltaker, asserted: "Bush is the one known quantity here. People really don't want Bush back."
In the middle of all this, the Bush camp is trying to adjust to Mr. Perot, although some Republicans worry that they are still not taking him seriously enough. "They have their truisms -- Perot falls by the wayside, they get their mano-a-mano with Clinton, the election is decided on personal qualities and they win," said one consultant.
But Charles Black, a senior adviser to the Bush campaign, said of Mr. Perot: "There's nothing we can do to affect what he's doing. And until he gets in and defines himself, it's not clear who he hurts and who he helps."
Frederic V. Malek, the campaign manager, says that for the time being Mr. Perot is "clearly helping us more than hurting us, because he's keeping Clinton from making any move."
If Mr. Perot enters and does not fade, many Republicans say, the strategic implications are profound. "States that would have been slam dunks, like Texas, become competitive," Mr. Malek said. "But states like Massachusetts also become competitive."
In other words, all the assumptions about what is a safe Democratic state and a safe Republican state will have to be re-examined.
All this feeds into the general uncertainty of a re-election campaign that, in the afterglow of the Persian Gulf war, seemed nearly a done deal for Mr. Bush.
Thomas Mann, director of governmental studies at the Brookings Institution, predicts that Mr. Bush will still win this November, but adds, "The whole script that was prepared seems quaintly out of date."

HEADLINE: U.S. Reluctance to Reduce CO<2> Is Sharply Criticized in Germany

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BONN, May 20

 BODY:
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and other German leaders called on the United States today to strengthen its environmental policies before the world environmental summit meeting in Rio de Janeiro next month.
Speaking to a special session of the German Parliament, Chancellor Kohl said Germany was willing to make substantial new contributions to the Global Environmental Facility, a fund established by the World Bank to support environmental programs in the developing world. 
 "I link this readiness with the expectation that other countries are also ready to assume their share of responsibility," the Chancellor said. "I am thinking especially of the United States and Japan."
According to German officials, the United States is blocking a World Bank proposal to triple the size of the $1.5 billion environmental fund after 1993.
 
Critical of 'Skepticism'
 Chancellor Kohl was one of the first world leaders to commit himself to attend the Rio conference, which officially opens June 3. Germany has some of the world's most advanced environmental laws, and public opinion here is highly sensitive to environmental issues.
The Chancellor told Parliament that when he introduced environmental questions at the 1988 economic summit meeting in Toronto, leaders of other industrial powers reacted with "great skepticism and even rejection."
"The industrialized nations must face their special responsibility," Mr. Kohl said. "Our 20 percent of the world population produces about 80 percent of worldwide carbon dioxide emissions. So it is clear who has the chief responsibility and who must bear the chief burden for reducing carbon dioxide emissions."
Scientists say these emissions, which come from automobiles and factories, contribute to depletion of the Earth's ozone level, which in turn could produce disastrous changes in the world's climate.
Environment Minister Klaus Topfer, who also addressed Parliament today, criticized the United States and Japan for refusing to increase energy taxes, as the European Community has suggested. The Europeans, he said, could not take such a step alone.
Gerhart Baum of the centrist Free Democratic party, which is a member of the governing coalition, criticized the United States for refusing to commit itself to reducing carbon dioxide emissions to the 1990 level by the end of this decade.

HEADLINE: Build an Empire! New York City Bonds in Yen

 BODY:
Going farther afield in its quest for financing, the Dinkins administration is planning to sell yen-denominated bonds to investors in Japan.
With an eye to lowering its borrowing costs, New York City has authorized the Nikko Securities Company to make preparations with Japanese authorities to sell up to $120 million of taxable yen-denominated bonds at some point this fall. 
 By selling securities in Japan, the city would be able to save because market interest rates are lower there than in the United States.
In a May 19 letter to Kichiro Takao, who is Nikko's president, Barry Sullivan, Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development, and Darcy Bradbury, the city's Deputy Comptroller for Finance, said any such financing in Japan would coincide with an offering of tax-exempt New York City securities in the United States.
 
Experience in TokyoXx
 The city is not authorized to issue securities denominated in foreign currencies, but it is seeking to acquire such authorization from Albany. Through Nikko, in March the city did sell dollar-denominated bonds in Tokyo.
If legislative approval is not granted, Mr. Sullivan and Ms. Bradbury said in the letter that the debt would be issued through a "special purpose not-for-profit corporation organized solely for the benefit of the city."
City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman said in a telephone interview that the effort was the latest in a series by the city to attract new investors. New York is by far the nation's biggest issuer of tax-exempt securities.
"The more demand there is, the less interest we will have to pay," Ms. Holzman said.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN;
Carter, With Clinton at His Side, Praises the Candidate's Qualities

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, May 20

 BODY:
Former President Jimmy Carter met with Gov. Bill Clinton in Atlanta today and made a case for sending another Southern Governor to the White House, saying that Mr. Clinton has the "knowledge and integrity" to be President.
But for all of Mr. Carter's kind words about the probable Democratic nominee and Mr. Clinton's effusive praise of Mr. Carter, the two men spent most of the news conference answering questions about Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire who is likely to wage an independent bid for the Presidency. 
 "I really look on Ross Perot right now as kind of, anybody-but-the-above," Mr. Carter said, adding these views of Mr. Perot:
"Eventually he's going to have to let the American people know what he stands for. He can't hide all the way through the season when people are actually going to be addressing him as a potential leader of our nation. He's been evasive so far, deliberately so. He brags on the fact that he doesn't get specific about what he's going to do about anything.
"He either doesn't have ideas clearly in mind now or he is ashamed and doesn't want to share his ideas with the public because they might be unpopular. I think that can go on only so long."
 
Carter Faults Republicans
 In a formal news conference held on the grounds of the Carter Center here, Mr. Carter also used the opportunity to take up an increasingly familiar Democratic Party view. The Republicans, he said, are the people responsible for "the deterioration of our inner cities and the sliding of our country into divisiveness between rich and poor, between black and white, between different regions of the country."
The words, which reflected those Mr. Clinton has used to attack the Bush Administration, were also similar to those employed by Gov. Ann W. Richards of Texas at a fund-raising dinner in Austin on Tuesday.
Mr. Carter endorsed Mr. Clinton last month, and an aide to the Arkansas Governor said the meeting today was designed to juxtapose Mr. Clinton, whom many voters have said they do not trust, with Mr. Carter, who has won high marks for honesty and public service.
Mr. Clinton has grown visibly agitated in recent days at having to fend off repeated questions about Mr. Perot's probable candidacy at a time when he is trying to raise his own stature as a general election candidate.
In response to reporters' questions in Austin on Tuesday, Mr. Clinton said he expected Mr. Perot's current popularity to go through a "life cycle."
"I can remember when I burst up in the popularity polls," Mr. Clinton said. "Those things happen. But in the end, people get a deep, full knowledge of whoever is there at the end of the Presidential race."
Mr. Clinton said today that Mr. Perot was enjoying an "initial honeymoon" that most national candidates experience when they are first presented to voters.
"That is an unbroken pattern as far as I know," he said. "The only thing I care about in those polls is whether I believe in the places I'm going and the people I'm talking to, whether I'm making progress. And I believe I am."
Mr. Carter said that Mr. Perot is at the pinnacle of his popularity with voters.
 
Discord Over Tax Cut
 "But he is going to have to show some substance other than being a non-politician who happens to have made a lot of money," said Mr. Carter, who said he had never met Mr. Perot.
Although he agreed with Mr. Clinton on the subject of Mr. Perot, Mr. Carter repeated his criticism of a central part of Mr. Clinton's economic recovery plan -- his call for a middle-income tax cut.
"I've never been in favor of advocating tax cuts when we have a deficit that's now approaching a half a trillion dollars a year," Mr. Carter said. He said that the White House and Congress should instead be willing to make "bold and politically courageous joint decisions negotiated very carefully about what would be best."
Americans, he said, would be willing to accept a "reasonable sacrifice" to address the Federal budget deficit. His words echoed a theme often sounded by Paul E. Tsongas, the former Massachusetts Senator who dropped out of the Presidential contest in March.

HEADLINE: Senate Passes Bill to Force States to Make Voter Registration Easie

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 20

 BODY:
With Democrats seeking higher turnouts at the polls, the Senate voted 61 to 38 today to make voter registration easier by allowing people to register by mail and as they renew their driver's licenses.
Changes in voter registration and limits on campaign spending have been the subjects of some of the most heated and partisan debate in the Senate this year, as Republicans and Democrats jockey to exploit or duck the electorate's cynicism and anger. 
 Several Democrats noted that the rise of Ross Perot as a likely independent Presidential candidate is a reflection of voter disgust with both parties, an emotion they hope to redirect squarely at the Republicans as protectors of business-as-usual politics.
 
Veto Is Predicted
 Senate Republicans have vowed that President Bush will veto the voter-registration bill, although the White House says he has not made a decision.
"We would likely veto it in its current form," a White House spokeswoman, Judy Smith, said today. She said that the bill would be costly for the states, that it could lead to fraud and that "the Voting Rights Act of 1965 already provides sufficient tools to challenge registration procedures that are discriminatory."
The House, which overwhelmingly passed a similar voter-registration bill two years ago, is expected to take up the matter again in a few weeks.
Democrats in the Senate lack the votes to override a veto, but they promise to make a political issue out of what they are portraying as a Republican effort to block electoral reform and to keep minorities and the disabled from voting.
Only 6 Republicans joined 55 Democrats in voting for the measure. Senator Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina was the sole Democrat against it.
Today's vote came a week after the Senate failed to override Mr. Bush's veto of another measure that Democrats promoted as electoral reform, a bill that would have limited Congressional campaign spending.
 
Explaining Low Turnout
 Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who led the Republican effort to defeat the registration bill, characterized it as "a solution in search of a problem" because, he said, low voter turnouts demonstrated that the electorate was basically happy with its leaders. And, he added, allowing people to register when they renew their driver's licenses is no guarantee of higher turnouts, since turnout has declined in 7 of the 10 states that have had such a procedure since 1972.
Republicans, who twice in the last year used the threat of a filibuster to block the measure from coming to the floor, say the bill will encourage vote fraud. Democrats, on the other hand, say Republicans fear that increasing the number of registered voters would add millions of Democrats to the rolls.
There is little evidence, however, that an increase in registration will lead to a considerable increase in voter turnout.
The measure, known in Congress as the "motor-voter" bill, would replace the patchwork of registration procedures that exists from state to state. It would require states to allow eligible citizens to register to vote at the same time they obtain or renew their driver's, fishing or hunting licenses. States would also have to offer voter registration by mail and at the offices of state agencies like welfare and unemployment offices. It would also prohibit removal of a registered voter's name from voter rolls for failure to vote.
Twenty-seven states, including New York and New Jersey, and the District of Columbia have some of the registration rules required in the bill. Of those states, five -- Montana, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas and West Virginia -- have adopted motor-voter procedures in recent months. The Connecticut legislature approved a motor-voter measure two weeks ago, and Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. is expected to sign it.
The bill, which if approved would become effective on Jan. 1, 1994, would not apply to states that do not require voter registration or that permit registration on Election Day.
The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the new registration procedures will cost the states a total of $20 million to $25 million a year, largely to computerize lists, with the cost decreasing after five years. Republicans say the expense will be much higher.
 
Motivating Voters
 Democrats said that the inconvenience of registration deters many citizens from voting and that their failure to participate in elections makes them feel only more alienated and apathetic. Republicans said that voter turnouts were high only in times of crisis and that turnout in general had little or nothing to do with registration rules.
Senator Wendell H. Ford, Democrat of Kentucky, said, "The bill will knock down the confusing and restrictive practices which continue to frustrate the right to participate in our democracy." He suggested that opponents of the measure were trying "to achieve through archaic and confusing registration procedures that which they cannot achieve through outlawed practices such as poll taxes and literacy tests."
While some Republicans have argued that the bill's provisions intrude on states' rights to regulate their elections, Senator McConnell said the bill's "most disturbing aspect" was "its potential to foster election fraud and thus debase the entire political process in this country." He warned that states would try to save money on the new procedures by doing away with registration completely, making it impossible to verify voter eligibility.
An aide to Senator Hollings, the only Democrat to vote against the bill, said Mr. Hollings was concerned that the requirement for mail registration would increase the risk of vote fraud.
But supporters of the bill said it contained sufficient safeguards against fraud, including making both false registration and procurement of fraudulent ballots a criminal offense.
Senator Mark Hatfield, an Oregon Republican who is a sponsor of the bill, said the motor-voter measure enacted in his state six months ago had already resulted in the registration of 72,000 new voters with no reports of fraud.
A coalition of 60 voter and civil rights groups lobbied hard for the Senate measure with letter-writing and telephone campaigns.
"Persistance has paid off," Susan S. Lederman, president of the League of Women Voters, said today. "Americans need national voter registration reform to break down the barriers that discourage and discriminate."
Richard A. Cloward, executive director of the 100% Vote project of Human Serve, a New York-based voter registration group, predicted that the legislation would raise voter registration to 95 percent, from 60 percent. "The Civil Rights Act of 1965 stopped Government from preventing people from registering to vote," he said, "and this legislation goes the final step by imposing on Government an affirmative obligation to register the eligible electorate."

HEADLINE: Trade Gap Widened In March

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 20

 BODY:
The nation's foreign-trade deficit widened sharply to $5.8 billion in March as imports surged and exports eased off their record levels, the Commerce Department reported today.
The March figure compared with a $3.3 billion deficit in February, the best performance in nearly nine years. 
 Since trade figures are among the last Government reports published each month -- many economic statistics have already been issued for April -- the latest data cast little light on the current state of the economy. But the trade figures did point up the danger that a sag in exports could undermine an already sluggish recovery and the likelihood of intensified trade friction with Japan.
 
 
Bigger Gap With Japan
 The American deficit with Japan rose by a third, to $4 billion, for the month, and pushed this year's deficit pace ahead of last year's by 4 percent. On Tuesday, the Bush Administration determined that Japanese mini-vans were being sold in the United States at unfairly low prices, beginning a process that could lead to higher duties.
Exports slipped in March by $679 million, or 1.8 percent, to $37 billion. The record level of exports in February was heavily aided by deliveries of aircraft, which this time showed only a modest gain that was not enough to offset a $434 million decline in capital goods, the biggest for any of the major categories.
Aircraft are expected to be a drag in April, with the Boeing Company having delivered only 27 planes abroad, according to analysts at the Mitsubishi Bank. Boeing, the nation's biggest exporter, delivered 24 planes in January, 34 in February and 37 in March.
Exports have provided a vital support to the economy during the recession, and the Bush Administration is relying on further strength in sales abroad to help sustain a recovery. But with the Japanese and various European economies slowing down, continued overseas demand for American goods is in doubt.
 
 
'Continued Deterioration' Is Seen
 "Until their domestic economies begin growing again, we can expect continued deterioration in our overall trade deficit," Barry Rogstad, president of the American Business Conference, a group of fast-growing corporations, said today.
But he noted that American manufacturing productivity had improved over the last few years. He said the gains "may enable us to ride out the current sluggish world economy with minimal declines in exports."
Imports rose in March by a hefty $1.84 billion, or 4.5 percent, to their highest level since November 1990. The biggest factor was a $500 million increase for capital goods, most of it reflected in a 6.1 percent jump for motor vehicles and parts.
Higher imports generally suggest robust consumer spending, which was evident during much of the first quarter but appears to have subsided this spring.
At $5.8 billion, the March deficit in merchandise -- services are reported separately -- was about the same as January's. Analysts did not expect the deficit to continue at February's low level of $3.3 billion, but the consensus was that half of that month's gains, instead of none of them, would survive.
As usual, a large chunk of the deficit reflected imports of crude oil and other petroleum products. The nation's bill for crude rose 10.7 percent, to $2.46 billion. Volume increased 3.3 percent and the average price edged up 4 cents a barrel, to $14.46.
Geographically, Japan accounted for 69 percent of the American deficit. Imports of Japanese cars rose to $1.82 billion, from $1.66 billion, while exports of American cars to Japan edged down to $48 million. This meant Japan sold 38 times as much of these goods as it bought from the United States.
The deficit with China fell by a third, to $800 million, while the deficit with Taiwan grew modestly, to $700 million. The deficit with Canada, the largest United States trade partner, eased to $500 million, from $650 million.
The American surplus with Western Europe narrowed to $2.3 billion, from $2.6 billion. The gap grew with Germany and the Netherlands, but it fell with Britain.
"The widening of the deficit with Japan suggests, obviously, that our deficit with that country remains a thorny issue," said Elliott Platt, an economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.

HEADLINE: Capitalism for Emigres, in 12 Steps;
Scientists From the Former Soviet Union Study an Unusual Subject: How to Get a Job

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SONTAG

 BODY:
One by one, the emigre scientists -- specialists in ichthyology, pisciculture, biomineralization and more -- rose to present themselves.
"I am Bril," the first man began. "I come here two months ago from Minsk." 
 Then the next: "My major is fracture mechanics. I have 20 publications in international journals."
And a graying engineer: "I was a supervisor," he said. "I have 30 certificates. Now, sadly, I am rather old."
It was a touching exercise, but awkward, like a bad "Saturday Night Live" skit snapped to life in a conference room on East 33d Street. Dozens of scientists and engineers, many of them stars in the former Soviet Union, had come together for a post-doctoral lesson in "the American mentality." Their goal, more bluntly: jobs.
 
Concepts Like Eye Contact
 It had been but a few months since most of them had arrived from Russia and Belarus, but the eager students had already found their way to this "crash course in capitalism" offered by an American-born astrophysicist and career counselor, Dr. Stephen Rosen.
Their capitalist re-education, which will take 12 sessions at no charge, began early this month at the Workmen's Circle, a former bastion of Jewish socialism, itself re-educated into a fraternal organization. With the ready humility of immigrants, these dozens of Ph.D.'s from St. Petersburg University, Moscow State and the Steklov Mathematical Institute arrived prepared to study concepts like eye contact, thank-you notes and the buddy system.
"I know about eye contact -- you have to maintain it -- but I have bad knowledge in many areas," Dr. Vladimir Faynberg of Kiev said, his glasses slightly askew. "For instance, must you really wear only a blue suit to a job interview or is brown acceptable?"
Dr. Faynberg may well be a physicist specializing in the nondestructive testing of semiconductors, but that and 50 cents, he has learned, will get him a cup of coffee in America. Neither he nor the others have any desire to take a typical first job for immigrants, like driving a taxicab. Why watch a meter tick when you could be tinkering with a carbon buckyball?
So, referred by refugee-resettlement agencies, former capitalism students and Russian-language newspapers, the emigres have found their way to this workshop, which will initiate them into such alien activities as networking, interfacing and looking for a job. It's a hazing they're willing to endure, considering that many are already suffering what they hope will be a temporary indignity of depending on public assistance.
Dr. Rosen estimated that more than 4,000 scientists have migrated here from the former Soviet Union in the last two years in what he calls a brain gain. His nonprofit program, Scientific Career Transitions, which is supported by grants and donations, grew from a marriage of his vocation in career counseling and his avocation, helping Jewish emigres.
 
Exploitation and Capitalism
 Standing before a hand-lettered sign that said, "Either Network or No Work," Dr. Rosen, whose grandparents came from what is now Belarus, gave them their mission: "The job that you have to do is to persuade or convince an American employer that you can bring in more money than they pay you. In the Soviet Union, this was called exploitation. In the U.S., this is called capitalism."
As would any self-actualization teacher worth his ego, Dr. Rosen introduced a success story, Dr. Aleksandr Salman, a once-nervous geophysicist from Moscow, who, after participating in the workshop, landed a position in soil mechanics at Polytechnic University in Brooklyn.
An elegant bearded man, Dr. Salman offered a testimonial. "I came over a year and a half ago," he said. "I figured out it's rather impossible to find a job here in my field, earthquake prediction. But I didn't give up.
"We must learn small things, for example, keep smiling," he said, his face impassive. "How to feel yourself comfortable when not comfortable. You must start making telephone calls. You must be in the right place at the right time."
Dr. Salman, after placing himself in the right place at the right time, discovered -- right in Brooklyn -- a project that could benefit from his knowledge of seismology. He is studying the vibrations shaking the historic town houses above the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway.
 
Resumes and Vodka at Lunch
 "Many people are proud of themselves because of their former achievements," Dr. Salman told his colleagues. "You must forget about that. You must accept anything you are offered."
Spouting aphorisms and jokes, Dr. Rosen, in "Topic A: Orientation," offered his dos and don'ts of looking for work in America.
Don't send out resumes randomly, rely on classified advertisements, wait for the phone to ring, arrive late or depressed for job interviews, smoke, photocopy cover letters or wear wrinkled brown suits.
"Class, is it O.K. to drink vodka during an interview lunch?" Dr. Rosen asked. There was a pause.
"Maybe a little?" one chemist ventured.
 
Einstein Never Wore a Tie
 Do be succinct, ask your interviewer questions -- "Don't let it become a K.G.B. interview" -- search the Scientific Citation index for those who have cited your research, call people in your field and engage them in shoptalk. And get a haircut.
Dr. Rosen nodded at another workshop graduate, Dr. Gregory Pelts, who has secured a research position in the high-energy physics department at the Rockefeller University. "Notice that Gregory does not wear a tie and jacket and has long hair. He fought with me. He said Einstein never wore a tie. Well, you're not Einsteins, not in the United States."
Dr. Pelts, however unkempt, was an exemplary networker. "I just called up Rockefeller University, and said, 'Good day, may I speak with someone working in string theory?' " he explained.
Russian-style bluntness can, however, prove clunky. Dr. Faynberg offered an example. He had gone for a chat, not exactly a job interview, but an opportunity nonetheless, at a laboratory in New Jersey. The topic was semistate conductors, and Dr. Faynberg's interviewer ventured an opinion, to which Dr. Faynberg responded, "You are wrong."
"His jaw dropped, and he looked at his watch and said, 'I'm in a hurry,' " Dr. Faynberg recounted. "It was a very unhappy occurrence."

No Miracle on Market St. for Final Retail Holdout

BYLINE: By CHARLES STRUM

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
AT the end yesterday, a floorwalker could roll a bowling ball down almost any aisle at Macy's in Newark and not hit anyone.
Sunday newspaper inserts announced specials or extended store hours at Herald Square and many branches, but not in Newark. 
 And the Cellar, Macy's famous Manhattan basement of exotic food and state-of-the-art pots and pans, was reduced to a small section of china, glassware and small appliances on the second floor here. The real basement in Newark was closed to shoppers, as were 12 of the 16 floors in the block-square building on Market Street.
By lunchtime, customers had already begun to hear about the end of a store whose slogan, "We're a part of your life," mocked the announcement yesterday. With the closing, Newark has lost the last and perhaps most potent symbol of a once-glorious mercantile history and suffered another blow in its attempt to restore an economy that fled with its middle class two decades ago.
While most shoppers expressed dismay, there was also a good deal of indignation that the only sizable chain stores left in downtown Newark would be two five-and-dime stalwarts, McCrory's and Woolworth's.
"Where am I going to do my shopping now?," said Octavia Hutchins, who had just bought a pair of shoes. "This is the last of the quality stores."
Ms. Hutchins, who lives in East Orange and teaches first grade in the Newark public schools, said she shopped at Macy's because it was convenient. And while its noontime trade rarely registered brisk on the shopping meter, it was the busiest part of the selling day, which revolved around the schedules of office and courthouse staffs on their breaks.
Mary Mahoney of Union Township, who works in state offices a few blocks away, said she shopped often, for cosmetics, clothes and housewares. "It saves us going to the mall at night," she said.
Macy's managers refused to discuss the closing, and many on its sales staff followed instructions not to talk about it. Reporters were politely asked to leave. But Ms. Mahoney and other customers reported that some of the 340 employees were clearly distraught, after having been told at 9 yesterday morning that the store, the largest of seven Macy's outlets to be shut, would close by Aug. 1.
Mayor Sharpe James expressed shock at the announcement but said through a spokeswoman, Pamela E. Goldstein, that he would not comment until after a meeting tomorrow morning that had been requested by a Macy's official earlier in the week.
In a statement issued in New York, Macy's said the Newark building, which is owned by the company, would stay occupied, housing a computer operation and corporate offices employing several hundred people.
In its heyday, the Macy's store, which began life in 1892 as L. Bamberger & Company, was a jewel of Newark's carriage trade. Its founder, Louis Bamberger, arrived from Baltimore, acquired a bankrupt dry goods shop called Hill & Cragg and turned it into a vast emporium of service and style. It made him rich, and he returned the favor, endowing the Newark Museum and the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton University.
By 1929, with both of his partners dead, he sold to R. H. Macy & Co., which kept the Bamberger name until 1986. Many customers still call the store by its old nickname, Bams, and the name L. Bamberger & Co. remains on bronze plaques outside the building.
 
'A Kind of Filene's Basement'
 For years, Bamberger's shared Broad and Market streets with stores like Kresge, Hahne's, Hearn's, Ohrbach's, Jay's, Burt's, S. Klein on the Square and Sears Roebuck & Company. All of them are gone.
And with Newark's economy souring, Macy's began to use its store here to move merchandise that failed to sell elsewhere. "It became a kind of Filene's basement, I guess," said Richard G. Schoon, president of the Chamber of Commerce, adding that in his impression the store was probably just breaking even.
Ultimately what happened to its predecessors happened to Macy's, just as it happened elsewhere: malls. But the character of Newark's neighborhoods and its central business district were contributing factors. Few people live downtown, so getting to Macy's meant driving or taking buses. There is little free parking, and if shoppers have to rely on buses, there are buses that go to the malls, which have more variety than the small, inexpensive shops that are all that remain on Market Street.

HEADLINE: Trenton Allows More Spending By Road Fund

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: TRENTON, May 20

 BODY:
Gov. Jim Florio today signed a bill that he said would provide $1.46 billion for work on roads and bridges and create 43,000 construction jobs in the next year.
The bill increases the statutory cap on spending from the Transportation Trust Fund to $565 million annually. 
 If the cap had not been lifted, Transportation Commissioner Thomas M. Downs said the state could have been forced to leave $263 million in Federal aid in Washington. Now the state will be able to spend a record amount in the next fiscal year on capital projects proposed by the Department of Transportation and New Jersey Transit.
"We're creating jobs and boosting the economy of the state at a time when we need it most," said Governor Florio, who included the proposal in his State of the State address.
The Legislature must approve the projects to be built with the money. The list includes two major rail projects in the Meadowlands, repairs to Interstate 80 and Route 17 in Bergen County and Route 21 in Newark, and the installation of electronic toll collection equipment along the Garden State Parkway, the New Jersey Turnpike and the Atlantic City Expressway.
Two years ago the cap on the transportation fund was temporarily raised to $565 million from $365 million. That change was scheduled to expire June 30.
The state trust fund, created in 1984, is supported by a part of the state tax on gasoline, trucking fees and toll-road contributions from the Garden State Parkway, the New Jersey Turnpike and the Atlantic City Expressway.
The trust fund's authority may also sell bonds.

A Glimpse Into Perot's Portfolio

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Ross Perot got rich in computers, and his current stock market investments show a decided tilt toward technology companies. But he has also made money lending to R. H. Macy & Company, getting out at a profit before the retailer went bankrupt. He also made millions speculating on the Japanese stock market.
Those are some of the items detailed in Mr. Perot's financial disclosure form filed with the Federal Election Commission covering his investment activity last year. 
The report shows that Mr. Perot, who is considering running for President, joined millions of other investors in sharply scaling back his short-term investments as interest rates plunged. While for many that meant taking money out of bank savings accounts, Mr. Perot sold millions of dollars in commercial paper issued by American and foreign companies for their short-term borrowing needs.
 
Selling Common Stocks
 Mr. Perot also sold substantial quantities of common stocks in 1991. He eliminated sizable positions in Marion Merrill Dow Inc., a drug company, reporting a capital gain of more than $100,000. He also sold shares of the NCR Corporation, a computer company acquired by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, producing a gain of between $50,000 and $100,000.
Mr. Perot became a billionaire by starting a computer services company, Electronic Data Systems, with a $1,000 investment. He took the company public and eventually sold it to the General Motors Corporation for cash and stock valued at $2.55 billion. With such a history, he has shown a willingness to invest in other young technology companies, both directly and through investments in venture capital partnerships.
And he has also speculated widely. He reported large profits last year on the sale of real estate, airplanes, municipal bonds, currency futures and computer technology, as well as from common and preferred stocks.
One of his largest profits in 1991 came from an investment in the Amtech Corporation, a Dallas company that developed computer-related products to aid in collecting highway tolls and identifying railroad cars.
Mr. Perot bought Amtech stock in 1987, two years before the company went public, a company spokeswoman said. The report shows that Mr. Perot sold his stock last year, making a profit of more than $1 million. He also turned a profit of at least $50,000 selling shares in Xilinx Inc., a San Jose, Calif., semiconductor company.
Mr. Perot also sold shares and stock options in Centocor Inc., a Malvern, Pa., biotechnology concern, realizing capital gains of at least $100,000 on the shares and at least $5,000 on the options. The sales appear to have been well-timed; Centocor has run into problems this year, encountering obstacles in bringing a new drug to market. But Mr. Perot still owned more than $1 million in Centocor convertible bonds at the end of 1991, on which he suffered substantial losses if he has not sold them.
He also turned a profit of at least $50,000 last year trading in stock options of Salomon Inc., the brokerage firm shaken by the Treasury bond scandal. He also reported capital gains of more than $100,000 from trading in options on Treasury bond futures.
Mr. Perot's filing was the most extensive anyone at the Federal Elections Commission could remember, but the forms used by the Government call for limited details for many of investments, asking only for broad ranges of values. In addition, because capital gains are reported but capital losses are not, and because original costs are not shown, it is not clear whether many of Mr. Perot's investments have been profitable.
In some cases, because the law says that filers need only provide the types of financial instruments being used, it is impossible to know on which side of an investment question Mr. Perot placed his bet.
For example, Mr. Perot reported that at the end of 1991 he owned futures contracts for crude oil worth more than $250,000, and that he owned more than $1 million worth of options on the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index.
Similarly, he had millions of dollars worth of positions in various currency contracts, whose value would be determined by whether the dollar rose or fell against the Swiss franc, the Japanese yen and the Canadian dollar. But there was no indication whether he had bet for or against the American currency.
James Squires, a spokesman for Mr. Perot, declined to say on which side Mr. Perot had invested. "There will be no comment from us on that document," he said. "It is a matter of principle." He said Mr. Perot had complied with all required disclosures and would go no further.
It is also unclear from the disclosure whether Mr. Perot was betting for or against Japanese stocks. However, he reported profits of more than $1 million each from investments in two index options contracts on the Nikkei 225-stock average in 1991, a year in which the Japanese stock index declined. That would seem to indicate he bet against the Japanese market.
At the end of the year, he held investments in two other Nikkei index contracts, each worth more than $1 million. If those contracts were also betting on lower Japanese prices, he would have made substantial profits this year, because Japanese stock prices have fallen rapidly.
Mr. Perot said his real estate holdings, including land parcels in Texas, Virginia and Georgia, were worth millions. And he reported making a capital gain of more than $100,000 when he sold a home in Eagle County, Colo.
Mr. Perot's investment in Macy was a large but relatively conservative one. The notes he bought were issued by a Macy subsidiary and secured by the company's credit card receivables, which are owed by customers.
Those notes were redeemed when Macy sold its credit card operation to the General Electric Company last year, giving Mr. Perot a capital gain of less than $15,000. Before he sold out, his interest income in 1991 from the notes was more than $100,000.
Mr. Perot also showed profits from Americus Trust securities, a conservative way to invest in certain stocks. He reported profits from selling "prime" units in the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and in Johnson & Johnson. Effectively, such investments allow an investor to own shares at a relatively low cost by giving up some possible capital gains.
In some cases, it is too early to tell if Mr. Perot has invested wisely, but he has placed substantial bets, including a stake of more than $1 million in Zonagen, a private company engaged in biotechnology research.

HEADLINE: Dow Off By 4.15, To 3,393.84

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stock prices fell slightly yesterday after the Dow Jones industrial average twice came close to passing 3,400. The modest setback from Tuesday's record highs came as interest rates turned upward in the credit markets.
The Dow, which had climbed nearly 22 points on Tuesday, gave back 4.15 yesterday to end at 3,393.84. 
 Losers held a narrow edge on gainers for all stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Big Board volume came to an estimated 198.8 million shares, up from 189.4 million on Tuesday.
 
Waiting Out the Fed
 Analysts said traders took a cautious approach as they waited for signs of whether the Federal Reserve was ready to ease its credit policy any further, given recent signs of slow, erratic growth in the economy.
Yields on long-term government bonds had fallen Tuesday to their lowest levels in about three months at 7.76 percent. In yesterday's trading they reversed course. Treasury bond prices fell about $5 for each $1,000 in face value, raising their yields to around 7.8 percent.
Wall Street seemed to take in stride General Motors' offering of more than $2.1 billion in new stock -- the largest sale of shares ever by an American company.
G.M. was easily the most active Big Board stock, with nearly 17 million shares traded. It ended by slipping 25 cents, to $39, matching the offering price for the 55 million new shares.
 
Salomon Buoyed by Settlement
 Salomon Inc. jumped $2.875, to $33.50. In its case involving last year's scandal in the Treasury securities market, Salomon reached a settlement with the Government that would permit the firm to remain a primary dealer in that business. Moreover, investigators and regulators said no criminal charges would be levied against Salomon or its Salomon Brothers subsidiary.
Humana fell $2.25, to $23, in active trading, as the company estimated lower quarterly profits.
British Airways gained $1.25, closing at $57. The company said it had no present plans to offer new stock, contrary to some recent speculation.
 
AMR Down on Earnings Outlook
 American Airlines' parent, AMR, dropped 87.5 cents, to $65.50. Analysts said it appeared that the company's second-quarter results would be disappointing in the aftermath of airline fare changes this spring. AMR's chairman, Robert Crandall, said at the annual meeting that the company was considering dropping out of unprofitable airline markets and studying "nontraditional options" to try improving its financial health.
QVC Network, traded over the counter, climbed $2.125, to $20.625. The television-shopping merchandiser reported earnings of 28 cents a share for the fiscal first quarter ended April 30, against 5 cents a share in the corresponding period a year earlier.
 
Blue-Chip Losers
 Losers among the recently strong blue chips included Walt Disney, down $1.50 at $39.375; Coca-Cola, down 62.5 cents at $44.50, and Ford Motor, down 25 cents, to $44.25.
McDonald's gained $1.375 to close at $46.125, a record high. The company said it knew of no fresh developments to explain the activity.
The Nasdaq composite index for the over-the-counter market rose 2.24, to 580.29. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index was down 0.22 at 392.15.

Prices Drop on the Fed's Inaction

BYLINE: BY KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities moved lower yesterday after the Federal Reserve Board indicated that it had not eased monetary policy again.
Expectations of a Fed easing were high after a report Tuesday that showed renewed weakness in the housing industry during April. 
 But for the second straight day the Fed sent a clear signal that policy remained unchanged by refraining to conduct open market operations.
Yields on short-term notes and bills were particularly sensitive to the lack of action by the Fed, and bids at a 1 P.M. auction of new two-year Treasury notes were at much higher rate levels than early in the session.
At the auction, the $14.5 billion worth of securities were sold at an average yield of 5.13 percent, well below the 5.43 percent average at the last two-year note sale on April 22. Still, early in yesterday's session the notes were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 5.02 percent.
 
'Healthy for Market'
 "This backup in rates is healthy for the market," one Government-bond trader said. "We have run a long way, and this takes some of the froth out."
In addition to the Fed's decision not to ease policy, traders said that heavy issuance of corporate bonds both here and overseas tended to dampen demand for Treasury securities yesterday.
Among the issuers in the corporate bond market was the province of Ontario, which sold $2 billion worth of 10-year notes. The global offering is the first undertaken by a borrower other than the World Bank.
Earlier, Toyota Motor floated $1 billion worth of five-year securities in the Eurodollar market.
However, the session was dominated by the Fed. A number of analysts said they were surprised the central bank chose not to ease policy.
"Given the weakness in the housing-start numbers and the fact that money supply figures are at the bottom of their growth targets, it seemed to me they had no reason to wait," said Raymond W. Stone, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a Princeton, N.J., firm.
 
Early Access to Data
 But Mr. Stone said Fed governors might have chosen not to ease policy because they had early access to money supply data.
"They may be waiting because they know that money growth is accelerating," he said. "If that isn't the case, I don't know what they are waiting for."
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 29 1/2-year bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 1026/32 , down 1/2 point, to yield 7.80 percent, compared with 7.76 percent late Tuesday.
Among Treasury note issues outstanding, the 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 101 3/4 in late trading, down 13/32 , to yield 7.25 percent. And the 6 7/8 percent five-year notes were offered at 10112/32 , down 13/32 , to yield 6.54 percent.
The Treasury is scheduled to auction $10.25 billion worth of new five-year notes today.
 
Short-Term Rates
 Rates on short-term Treasury bills rose after the Fed chose not to ease monetary policy.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 3.57 percent late yesterday, up six basis points, or six one-hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates rose by eight basis points, to a late offered rate of 3.68 percent. And one-year bill rates rose by a similar amount, to a late offered rate of 3.88 percent.
Among the new debt issues priced in the investment-grade corporate bond market was a two-part $243 million offering by Commonwealth Edison.
The smaller part of the offering consists of $103 million worth of 6 1/8 percent three-year notes.
The notes were priced at $99.70 to yield 6.236 percent, 57 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 5 7/8 percent three-year notes at the time of pricing.
The remaining $140 million were offered as 12-year, 8 percent notes.
These securities were priced at 99.70 to yield 8.10 percent, 85 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing.
Salomon Brothers acted as lead manager for the offering. Both parts of the issue are rated A-3 by Moody's Investors Service and A- by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
 
Tax-Exempt Offering
 In the tax-exempt municipal bond market, a group led by the Bank of America won at competitive bid a $155.5 million issue of general obligation bonds issued by San Francisco.
The bonds were reoffered to investors with yields from 3.25 percent in 1993 to 6.30 percent in 2012.
The securities are rated AA by both Moody's and Standard & Poor's.
Traders in the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds said that prices of most widely quoted issues slipped by 1/8 point to 1/4 point.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of two-year Treasury notes:

New Hewlett Computers Aim for Mainframe Market

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif., May 20

 BODY:
The Hewlett-Packard Company introduced its most powerful midrange computers today. They are intended to supplant more costly room-size mainframes that many corporate offices are seeking to replace with smaller machines.
The company said its nine new machines, which are about the size of refrigerators and range in price from $365,000 to $925,000, had as much speed and power as multimillion-dollar mainframes. 
 "These computers are about 60 to 70 percent more powerful than our current high-end machines, so it's a great leap forward," said Lewis Platt, executive vice president in charge of Hewlett-Packard computer systems. "We're calling them alternatives to mainframes because we can match that workload."
Forty-six percent of mainframe owners said last year that they planned to switch to smaller, but powerful computers that could handle multiple tasks and lots of data, according to Dataquest, Inc., a San Jose market research firm.
"The watchword in the industry these days is downsizing," said Tom Willmott, an analyst with the Boston-based Aberdeen Group research company. "Executives are not about to just throw out their mainframes," he said. "But they have been under enormous pressure to reduce expenses and retain productivity."
 
Cost Comparison
 Hewlett-Packard said that buying and operating a standard mainframe cost about $15 million over three years, compared with about $2.7 million for its new computers. Mr. Willmott agreed with the assessment that high-end computers that match mainframes were much more economical.
He noted, however, that the high-end computer market was not easy to crack. For example, he said, the VAX 9000 system made by the Digital Equipment Company had not done well in the market and was recently withdrawn. He said the Digital machine did not accomplish mainframe-level power as promised.
Mr. Willmott said that Hewlett-Packard had made a heavy commitment as early as 1985 to its precision-architecture RISC, or reduced-instruction-set computing, chips. "So now, it's paying off," he said. "They don't have to funnel money into competing systems."

HEADLINE: British Airways Plans A Slight Peak Fare Rise

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
Despite strong bookings, British Airways said yesterday that it planned to raise fares only slightly for the peak summer travel season on the main North Atlantic routes.
The good news for travelers was delivered by Sir Colin Marshall, British Air's chief executive, at a briefing for analysts and the press at the Pierre Hotel. The airline is by far the largest carrier across the North Atlantic. 
 Normally, when bookings are strong, carriers try to push up fares, and in addition the heavy losses caused by the Persian Gulf war last year have created pressure to try to recoup when times are good.
But some analysts said that the economic recovery in many nations had been fragile and a fare increase could dampen a travel rebound that has begun on most international routes.
British Air's fare increases are expected to be about 1 to 2 percent, Sir Colin said.
 
'A Good Idea'
 "Holding the line on a fare increase is a good idea," said Rose Ann Tortora, an airline analyst for County NatWest. "The economies of the world are just getting their strength back and they could be set back again."
British Airways said that its April traffic increased 10.3 percent from April 1990. The comparison was not made to April 1991, it said, because the gulf war severely skewed that month's results.
Holding down fare increases will mean that peak-season travel between the United States and Europe will be cheaper than it has been in some time.
In 1989, for example, the lowest fare between London and New York available on weekends was $692 round trip. It rose to $738 in 1990, and increased again in 1991 to $758. This summer it is expected to be about $689.
Sir Colin said that bookings in economy class, where most early bookings are made, were so strong that those who waited until the last minute might not find space.
Virgin Atlantic recently announced a low fare of $398 round trip from New York to London but it must be bought on the day of travel. The offer is good until June 15.
Sir Colin said British Air would consider the Virgin Atlantic low fare but said the airline already had attractive low fares and might decide not to match.
Lori Levin, a spokeswoman for Virgin, said the carrier's bookings had been strong.
Another reason that British Airways may want to keep fares low is that it plans a major increase in capacity on the North Atlantic of 11.5 percent over two years ago. The carrier will, for example, beef up its flights from one daily to two a day to London from Chicago, Boston, Washington and Miami.
Sir Colin said that all the major carriers such as American, United and Virgin were putting more seats on the North Atlantic route.
 
A Strong Recovery
 Domestic traffic has been disappointing for the United States carriers, which hope that a good summer on recently acquired international routes will help offset the domestic weakness.
British Airways has shown a strong recovery from the heavy losses that most carriers suffered last year. In the company's fiscal fourth quarter, ended March 31, the airline showed a profit of $37 million, compared with a loss of $254 million in the same period a year earlier. Revenue totaled $2 billion, up 29.3 percent.
British Airways has also held its own in the increasing competition in the North Atlantic, having seen its market share go up by 1 percent at Heathrow even though 17 new carriers have begun service to Heathrow in recent years.

HEADLINE: Philip Morris to Buy Control Of Czech Cigarette Maker

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PRAGUE, May 20

 BODY:
In one of the largest American investments in the former Soviet bloc, Philip Morris has agreed to pay $413 million for control of the Czechoslovak cigarette manufacturer Tabak, beating a rival offer from R. J. Reynolds in a fiercely contested bidding war.
The investment is the second largest made here by a foreign company; Volkswagen agreed last year to put $6.4 billion into the Skoda automobile factory. 
 It is a sign of growing American interest in Czechoslovakia. Mart Bakal, a senior United States adviser to the Privatization Ministry, said American companies had committed $1.4 billion to Czechoslovak investments, most of it in recent months.
Among these investments, he said, were $89 million by Coca-Cola in the Praszke soft drink company, $118 million by Kmart in the Prior and Maj Department Store, $250 million by Dow Chemical in the Chemicke Zavody Sokolov company and $27 million by Teepak, a maker of food packaging, in the Cutisin sausage casing company.
Although contractual details of the Tabak sale are still being hammered out, officials of Philip Morris and the Privatization Ministry said there was no doubt that it would go through.
"It's a done deal," said Louis Camilleri, Philip Morris vice president for Eastern Europe. Tabak controls nearly two-thirds of the Czechoslovak cigarette market.
Privatization Ministry officials said Philip Morris would pay $226.2 million for 65 percent of the company. This will be divided into an initial payment of $104.2 million for the first 30 percent, followed by the balance of $122 million within a year.
After that, Philip Morris will invest $187 million in modernization of Tabak and bring its equity stake over 80 percent. The balance will be held by the public.
The deal comes after a long period of American hesitation during which German companies raced ahead and plowed some $2.5 billion into Czechoslovakia. It appears to reflect a growing conviction that the country offers strong long-term prospects despite current difficulties.
 
Aggressive Privatization
 National output plunged 19.5 percent last year and inflation soared above 55 percent, but the country has now brought inflation under control and is pushing forward with the most aggressive privatization plans in Eastern Europe. With low labor costs, a skilled work force and a central position in Europe, the country is being viewed as an increasingly attractive export base by United States and other Western companies.
Mr. Camilleri said Tabak would be used to provide cigarettes for what Philip Morris anticipates will be "a phenomenal growth of exports to Russia, which is short of cigarettes, and also to Central Asia."
Mr. Bakal, who has seen the American company's business plan, said it spoke of exporting at least a billion cigarettes a year to the countries of the former Soviet Union. Unlike in Western Europe and the United States, the former Soviet bloc has stable or growing cigarette consumption.
Philip Morris appears to have paid a high price for the company. The investment bankers advising the Czechoslovak Government said Tabak had profits of about $2 million in 1990 on sales of about $170 million. Philip Morris has thus paid a large premium in an attempt to control the Czechoslovak tobacco market and a build a strong long-term base in Eastern Europe.
R. J. Reynolds, which bid $291 million for Tabak, and the French tobacco company Seita have protested to the Czechoslovak Government over the sale, which they contend was unfair, asserting that Philip Morris had been provided with privileged information on Tabak. A senior official of the Privatization Ministry said these complaints were unfounded and had been rejected.

HEADLINE: 'Nigerian Scam' Lures Companies

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
In the annals of white-collar crime, the trick known as the Nigerian letter scam already stands out as a testimony to criminal energy, not artistry. Sleuths at Scotland Yard, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Interpol and private investigators describe it variously as crude, amateurish and preposterous. But they also agree it is one of the most wide-ranging and bizarre fraud schemes of recent years.
Thousands of American companies, including many in the New York area, have in the last 18 months received bogus letters that like many a street fraud preying on the greedy promise big payoffs in return for playing along and putting up some advance money, according to the International Criminal Police Organization. That agency, known as Interpol, is the coordinating network for police internationally.
 
Loss Estimates Are Sketchy
 
 "You almost never see a net spread this wide in white-collar fraud," said Dan Karson, a managing director of Kroll Associates, a large financial-investigation company in New York. Estimates of the number of victims and their losses are sketchy -- up to more than $200 million worldwide, according to Scotland Yard.
The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, a Treasury Department unit that investigates white-collar crime, has just issued a warning under the heading "Nigerian Scam" to the banks, lawyers and private investigators who receive its quarterly bulletins.
Here is one common version of the scheme: A letter arrives from a writer who says he is a director of the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation. It looks official and reads convincingly, though its offer is unusual.
The writer says he wants to transfer $20 million to your bank account. The money, he writes, was budgeted but never spent, and your help is needed to spirit the questionable funds out of Nigeria. The letter hints strongly that such official shenanigans are a routine part of government and business life in Nigeria.
Your company gets to keep 30 percent of the total -- a cool $6 million -- for playing along. The Nigerians pick up the rest, after expenses. Just to get the process started, you are asked to send a few sheets of your company's letterhead (signed but otherwise blank), your bank account number and other information.
The letter, the director and the offered money, of course, are all fake -- an attempt to dip into the target company's bank account or collect advance fees for the phony transfer of funds. Thousands of similar letters have been sent to companies from Sweden to Australia in the last few years.
"It's a real shotgun approach," agreed Edgar Adamson, an assistant chief of financial fraud for Interpol in Washington. "They just send out all sorts of letters and see who replies."
 
Prosecutions Are Few
 Prosecutions are few and convictions fewer. In Britain, there have been four successful convictions, with the most recent offender sentenced in February to two years in prison for fraud. And last November, the United States Attorney's Office in Manhattan charged two men, Prince Churchill Ovu and Wilson Alex Holland, with defrauding an unnamed New York businessman of $444,000 -- a bogus advance fee to release $18.6 million that, the victim was told, had been illicitly obtained from contractors for the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation.
Many victims are too embarrassed to come forward. When the victims do go to the police, the culprits are hard to find because the letters have fake names.
"The victim is left facing bogus people with bogus documents," said Detective Inspector Paul Brown of Scotland Yard's fraud squad. "Identifying the people behind one of these letters is a big problem."
The Nigerian letter scheme appears to have picked Britain as its first target, starting nearly three years ago. By now, Scotland Yard has more than a thousand letters from British companies, dozens of victims, and a sense that the worst is over. "The anecdotal evidence is that the letters are fewer here and the problem is moving across the Atlantic and to Scandinavia," Detective Inspector Brown said.
 
Bogus Identities
 The letters differ somewhat in the amounts on offer and the bogus identities of their phantom authors, like Rowland Olebara of the state oil company and Chief G. P. Uche of the aviation ministry.
Most of the letters, though not all, are sent from Nigeria. Investigators assume that the Western corporate names are plucked randomly from business directories. The letters are so numerous and sent to so many countries that "there was an assumption for a long time that there was a school for this," said David Brooker Sr., president of the National Fraud Investigation Center Inc., a private investigator in Ambler, Pa. "But it's probably just the streets of Lagos."
The Nigerian Government is understandably distressed by the letter scheme and has tried to curb the fraud. To be sure, Nigeria has been tagged with a reputation for sharp dealing because its citizens have been involved in publicized white-collar schemes in the United States during the 1980's, including credit card, student loan and insurance frauds.
But in a nation of more than 100 million people, the letter-writers represent "a small number of small-time crooks -- and nothing more," said Richard Uku, a counselor in the Nigerian Embassy in Washington. A handful of criminals, he stressed, should not deter the Western investors Nigeria is trying to attract to further its free-market reforms.
To warn foreigners, Nigeria's central bank placed an advertisement last fall about the schemes in major Western newspapers, including The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post.
 
Some Went to Lagos
 Law enforcement authorities in Britain and the United States say that some victims have met with people in Government buildings in Lagos who said they were Nigerian officials. But the Western investigators add that there is no evidence Nigerian Government officials are involved.
"The Nigerian Government is not a party to this sort of thing," Mr. Uku said. He advises American companies that have received suspicious letters from Nigeria to contact the country's embassy in Washington or the consulate general in New York City.
Besides, Mr. Uku added, victims of the Nigerian letters are partly to blame for their plight. "The people who would bite on this are greedy," he said.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "How the Letter Scheme Works"
 
1) The Mysterious Letter
The letter arrives at a company from Chief Uche, who claims to be chief accountant of a Nigerian Government ministry. It offers to give the company 30 percent of $25 million, or $7.5 million, for helping the Chief transfer the $25 million out of Nigeria. The funds, the letter explains, represent a "deliberate" overpayment by the ministry budgeted to be paid to a foreign contractor. In short, the funds to be transferred are shady. This is meant to give the company the illusion of being in on a lucrative back-channel deal that would be jeopardized if the company checked with authorities
 
2) The Catch
To get the deal started, the letter asks the company to send blank sheets of its letterhead, blank company invoices, the name of the company's bank, its account number, and telex and fax numbers.
 
3) Playing Out the Scheme
If the target firm replies, the Nigerians can use the information and the blank stationary to try to dip into the company's bank account. Or, having found a gullible company, the Nigerians can try to get money directly under the pretense of "advance fees" needed to execute the deal. They may ask the company to purchase air fare for face-to-face meetings, or say the company must pay an "economic recovery tax" supposedly required under Nigerian law before funds can be transferred outside the country.
 
4) The Chief Vanishes
 The documents sent to the company are phony and so are the names of the Nigerian officials. The $25 million transfer never appears. But the company's money is genuinely gone, and the culprits are hard to find.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Slightly Higher And Gold Prices Are Mixed

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar settled marginally higher yesterday in technically driven trading.
Gold prices were slightly higher to lower. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $338 an ounce, up 20 cents from Tuesday. The Republic National Bank later gave a price of $337.50, unchanged from Tuesday. 
The dollar reversed its downward spiral of the last few sessions but still held to a narrow trading range, dealers said. There was little news to move the market.
 
Shrugs Off Trade Report
 Traders did not react to a worse-than-expected report on the United States trade deficit, which climbed to $5.82 billion in March. Americans' appetite for foreign goods pushed imports to an 18-month high, while weakness in overseas markets cut into export sales, the Government said yesterday.
Many were counting on continued improvements in trade to support the economic recovery, but the negative report could be a sign of more bad news.
Currency dealers turned their attention to the Federal Reserve, monitoring the central bank's actions to see if it would intervene in the money markets to push interest rates lower.
When the Fed did not act by midday, traders quickly bought dollars.
"There was one spurt of buying all day," said Kevin Lawrie of the Bank of Boston.
Attention is now centering on tomorrow, when traders think the Fed will take action to trim the discount rate. "There's a lot of talk and rumor and innuendo" about a rate cut, Mr. Lawrie said.
Such a move would be bearish for the dollar, however, since lower interest rates make dollar-denominated securities less valuable to investors.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 129.22 yen, up 0.22 yen from Tuesday. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 129.65 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 129.50 yen, up from 129.10.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.8300, from $1.8400 late on Tuesday. In New York, it cost $1.8310 to buy a pound, less expensive than Tuesday's $1.8385.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's rates, included: 1.6010 German marks, up from 1.5905; 1.4700 Swiss francs, up from 1.4600; 5.3865 French francs, up from 5.3475; 1,205.00 Italian lire, up from 1,197.00, and 1.1945 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1944.

F. D. R.'s Moviemaker
Memoirs and Scripts
By Pare Lorentz
243 pages. Illustrated. University of Nevada Press. $29.95.
Pare Lorentz, the great American documentary film maker, didn't live to see the publication of his invaluable "F. D. R.'s Moviemaker," but fortunately he completed the manuscript before his death on March 4 at the age of 86. The book is a personal monument to his trailblazing and a reminder of the glory years of that overlooked art form, the social documentary. 
 And it is more. In light of the current harassment of creative artists and performers by political watchdogs, including those who would dismantle public television, the Lorentz memoir serves to recall that the Federal Government was a fountainhead of financial support and encouragement for the arts during the New Deal era.
The Federal Writers' Project employed such struggling authors as Conrad Aiken, Nelson Algren, Saul Bellow, John Cheever, Ralph Ellison and Richard Wright. The more controversial Federal Theater Project, which produced a range of plays, from an all-black version of "Macbeth" to Sinclair Lewis's "It Can't Happen Here," gave work to such talents as John Houseman, John Huston, E. G. Marshall, Arthur Miller and Orson Welles. Under attack from the House Committee on Un-American Activities, the Federal Theater Project was abolished by Congress in 1939.
The title of Lorentz's book is no idle boast. In 1938, President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed him chief of a newly established small agency, the United States Film Service. With a storyteller's eye, Lorentz describes the scene at a White House dinner in 1939 when the President introduced him to two Episcopalian bishops. They were dressed in velvet knee breeches and were smoking long cigars that reminded the young film maker of Hollywood movie producers. To the annoyance of the bishops and other dignitaries, Roosevelt singled out Lorentz and said: "He's my shooter. He photographs America to show what it's like to our people."
That description was based on a reputation Lorentz shared with John Grierson and Robert Flaherty, two other legends in the documentary field. They used film as an instrument for social change, to expose violations of human dignity and the precious environment, and for educational instruction and occasional propaganda.
In his memoir, Lorentz describes his beginnings in the 1920's as a contributor of brief items to The New Yorker and as a film critic for Judge, Vanity Fair, Town and Country and McCall's. Coming from a poor family in West Virginia, he was familiar with the plight of the homeless and unemployed. He decided to turn his hand from film reviewing to film making.
In 1936, with a budget of $6,000, he wrote and directed "The Plow That Broke the Plains," about the plight of people living in the Dust Bowl and the fragility of the earth's mantle. The documentary, which had a score by Virgil Thomson, was sponsored by the Resettlement Administration. After the Resettlement Administration was adjudged unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, it was moved into the Agriculture Department by Executive order and renamed the Farm Security Administration.
In 1938, Lorentz wrote and directed a second classic, "The River," again with music by Thomson, for the Farm Security Administration. It was a history of the Mississippi River Basin and the effect of the Tennessee Valley Authority on controlling erosion and flooding. This time Lorentz came in with a master print for $49,500. "The River" opened at the Criterion Theater in New York, received universal praise and won the award for best documentary that year at the Venice Film Festival.
Lorentz gave the documentary a new direction in 1939 with "The Fight for Life," an adaptation of Dr. Paul de Kruif's book, for the United States Film Service. By vividly depicting infant mortality in the Chicago slums, the film illustrated the inadequacies of prenatal hygiene. It was released theatrically by Columbia Pictures.
In "The Fight for Life," for which he also wrote the screenplay, Lorentz used Broadway actors, including Myron McCormick, Will Geer and Dudley Digges, to portray doctors. More than two-thirds of the 68-minute film was shot on the scene in real tenements and the Chicago Lying-In Hospital, a fact that the author cites in response to the purists who objected to the use of actors in a documentary.
Students of the documentary will appreciate the background notes and actual scripts of these Lorentz films that appear in the book. His narrative writing is in the spirit of "The Grapes of Wrath" by John Steinbeck and "The People, Yes," by Carl Sandburg. Some of the spirited Depression language in "The Plow That Broke the Plains" and "The River" would be frowned upon today in a Government-sponsored film or over the commercial airwaves.
"F. D. R.'s Moviemaker" blends autobiography and film history. It's a tribute to a bold documentarian and to an idealistic time in the arts.

HEADLINE: PARENT & CHILD

BYLINE: By Lawrence Kutner

 BODY:
WHEN a parent borrows money from a child, it can be an uncomfortable situation for both generations. We've come to expect the opposite, with the younger generation asking the older for financial help to make a down payment, pay tuition or handle a crisis. But there are times when parents must approach their children for assistance. It is an act that can affect their relationship long into the future.
Dr. Bernard Guerney Jr., a professor of human development and counseling psychology at Pennsylvania State University in State College, Pa., said: "There's an old saying: 'When a father helps a son, both smile. When a son helps a father, both cry,' In our culture, for a parent to borrow from a child is often considered shameful and embarrassing." 
 Much of that discomfort derives from the contradictory expectations that parents and children have about their relationships as children enter adulthood. Parents usually hope their children will be more successful than they were, but it is a social leap that has become more difficult for the current generation of young adults. Parents also expect to maintain their independence so they won't be a burden.
Children want to be able to think of their parents as people to whom they can always turn for help. At the same time, they want to be prosperous enough to care for their parents if the need arises.
"There's an inherent conflict there," said Dr. Alan Entin, a family psychologist in Richmond and the past president of the division of family psychology of the American Psychological Association.
Dr. Entin has borrowed money from his children, who are now in their 20's. They had received inheritances from a distant relative and had kept that money in a savings account. He felt obligated to pay for their collegeexpenses, but needed a loan to do so. By borrowing from his children, he could pay at a lower interest rate than he could if he borrowed from a bank. At the same time, he could give his children a higher return than their bank was giving them.
"While it's a straightforward business deal, I had feelings of awkwardness and humility," Dr. Entin added. "I wish I'd had the money in the bank just to write a check."
In most families, however, a request for a loan is prompted by a personal crisis such as a medical emergency or a business problem. Few children would hesitate to help in such a situation if able to do so. But in their rush to help, psychologists said, children may inadvertently do things that lead to trouble. "If you don't talk about your feelings about the money, and such things as what if the parents can't pay it back, then you're setting yourself up for later problems," said Dr. Norman Epstein, a professor of family and community development at the University of Maryland in College Park.
Yet the many symbolic meanings of money in our culture make it especially difficult for families in this situation to discuss their true feelings about the need for a loan or a gift. Parents often feel embarrassed, as if it is a sign of failure instead of circumstance.
"A parent who borrows money from a child will have an awful lot of self-esteem on the line," said Dr. Sandra J. Eller, a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Rochester Medical School.
Children may feel uncomfortable asking for details, as if doing so would be an intrusion. By not asking questions, however, they are falling back into their old roles as children, which may leave them resentful.
Dr. Epstein described a 30-year-old man he counseled who had been sending his parents money. Both generations were uneasy discussing money. The parents had asked for help only indirectly. The son had felt it was too awkward to ask whether he'd be repaid. Although he expected that he would be, he never discussed the issue directly with his parents.
"Eventually, he felt so uncomfortable and angry that he avoided his parents," Dr. Epstein said. "He would have felt more comfortable if he'd just given it to them without expectation of being repaid.
"But this way he felt cheated by his parents, even though it wasn't a large sum."
 
THERE'S MORE THAN MONEY INVOLVED IN A LOAN
IF you have decided to ask for money from your children -- or if your parents ask you for a loan -- psychologists have some suggestions to help avoid problems:
Remember that the money is only one part of the transaction.
Discuss the underlying emotions, as well. "The goal at all times should be to preserve or enhance the good feelings in the relationship," said Dr. Sandra J. Eller, a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Rochester Medical School. "It's a chance for you to know one another even better."
Recognize that borrowing from a child often puts more pressure on parents than if they had borrowed from a bank. "It tinges all their future interactions," said Dr. Alan Entin, a family psychologist in Richmond. "It's hard for the parents to spend any money on themselves before paying back their children."
Put things in writing.
It is a good idea to do this, even if you don't want it to be a legally binding contract. "It limits the chance of hard feelings," Dr. Eller said. "It can also prevent problems with siblings if the parents die and the child expects to be paid back out of the estate."
Writing an agreement has other benefits, as well. "That businesslike approach helps the parents still feel like adults and in control," said Dr. Norman Epstein, a professor of family and community development at the University of Maryland in College Park. "If the child just slips the money to the parents and doesn't talk about it, it strips the parents of their adulthood."
Recognize that sometimes the best answer is "no."
As with children, there are times when a parent's request for money is simply a sign of a problem, like alcoholism or compulsive gambling, that needs a different approach. Providing the parent with additional money will often make those problems worse. "It puts the children in a difficult bind because they're now in the position of being the parents," Dr. Eller said.
If that is the case, call a family meeting to explore ways to deal with the real issues and to get the outside help that's needed.

Punish the Serbs

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
In the face of Serbia's bloody invasion of its neighbors, President Bush has ducked under his desk in a way that recalls Benjamin Harrison's 1888 doctrine: "We Americans have no commission from God to police the world."
Excuses for inaction range from "it's Europe's problem" to "our vital interests are not involved" to "those historic hatreds run so deep, there's nothing anybody can do." 
 The unspoken excuse is that in an election year, no American politician wants to commit American forces to what may be a quagmire. Yet the lack of any threat of harsh consequences encourages the aggression.
What would the other candidates do to stop the killing if they were President right now? I phoned that question to Ross Perot's spokesman and was faxed this prompt, if Carteresque, response: "I would be actively working with the United Nations in an effort to restore peace to the area." Can't get in trouble with a platitude.
Bill Clinton, after criticizing Bush "indifference," responded: "The United States and the international community must adopt immediately the kinds of tough sanctions that will make the Milosevic regime pay a heavy price for continuing its aggression, such as freezing assets, an oil embargo, and suspension or expulsion from appropriate international organizations."
That's at least a policy that offers change. Opinion makers as far apart as Anthony Lewis and Jeane Kirkpatrick agree that if collective security is to have meaning, the President of the United States must do more during mass slaughter than send Margaret Tutwiler out to wring her hands and play Benjamin Harrison.
Last year we saw how televised pictures of atrocities turned around a callous, let-it-happen policy in Iraq. After the public outcry, Mr. Bush put a protective air cap over much of Iraqi Kurdistan; as a result, this week, for the first time in a thousand years, Kurds are voting in a free, democratic election.
A Bosnia-Herzegovinan official -- this year's Haile Selassie -- says that if the world intervened to escort relief to starving, persecuted Kurds, why not Bosnians? "We are real people, too."
Did America set a precedent by protecting the Kurds? Or was that a special case, where our interests were at stake, where we had a moral responsibility because we had called for the anti-Saddam uprising, and where the American public supported our intervention?
Answer: both. The extent of our participation will depend on previous commitment, vital national interest and sphere of influence. But wherever in the world brutality is inflicted on millions of people, America's place is in the vanguard of marshaling civilization's response.
The Serbs have earned a reputation for ferocity. They are now represented by -- and not oppressed by -- their own dictator, Slobodan Milosevic. They are seizing territory they believe was stolen from them. If this causes death and desolation, they say, so be it -- Serbs have suffered in the past, too.
Sorry, but the law of the jungle has been repealed. No longer should any people get away with barbarism in the name of vengeance.
How do we stop the killing? The international community -- that's Germany, France, Britain, Russia and the U.S., under U.N. or regional auspices -- must put an intolerable cost on continued aggression.
This does not mean Operation Balkan Storm; the Serbs, unlike the Iraqis, would fight forever. Nor would this mean namby-pamby sanctions like suspending airline landing rights.
It means, as Mr. Clinton suggests, embargoing Serbia's oil and freezing its assets. Beyond that, we should impinge on its long-sought sovereignty by seizing Serbian airspace, much as we have done in Kurdistan.
This would not immediately stop Serbian aggression, but it would be a painful and humiliating penalty. Peacemakers would have cards to play.
Harrisonism need not paralyze us. "Chronic wrongdoing," wrote Theodore Roosevelt, "or an impotence which results in a general loosening of the ties of civilized society, may . . . ultimately require intervention by some civilized nation."
Update that to "alliance of nations" and apply the responsibility to intervene to the Balkans today.

Mockery of Justice

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
On one side in the lawsuit is the United States Government, represented by the Justice Department. On the other is a group of Haitian refugees held at the U.S. base in Guantanamo, Cuba, represented by some Yale law students, their professor and other volunteers.
One might think that the Government would be content with those odds -- with its great advantages in power, money and legal resources. Not so. 
 The Justice Department has brought heavy pressure on the volunteer lawyers, evidently trying to intimidate them out of the case. It has made extreme, hysterical arguments with no visible basis in fact. In its conduct in this case -- this amazing case -- the Department has grossly abused its position. Why? What is going on?
The plaintiffs, who fled the brutal Haitian military regime in small boats and were picked up by the U.S. Navy, are in a special category. All of them have been screened by the Immigration and Naturalization Service and found to have a "credible fear" of political persecution in Haiti. By our own official finding, then, they are likely candidates for political asylum in the United States, not just people looking for a better economic life.
The only issue in the lawsuit is whether the refugees can talk to a lawyer before a final determination of their asylum claim. The Yale law students want to go to Guantanamo, at their own expense, to question and advise them. The Government strenuously objects.
Just three months ago the Justice Department told the Supreme Court that, "under current practice," Haitian refugees who pass the first screening would be "brought to the United States . . . for a full adjudicatory determination" of their asylum claim. That meant a hearing with a lawyer.
But the practice changed. And when the Yale law students sued for the right to meet the refugees, the Justice Department responded with a sledgehammer.
The department asked the Federal courts to impose sanctions on the plaintiffs' lawyers -- Prof. Harold Hongju Koh of Yale and Michael Ratner of the Center for Constitutional Rights -- for bringing a "frivolous" lawsuit. It demanded that the plaintiffs put up a bond of $10 million, the largest bond ever sought in the New York Federal courts.
The case was heard by Judge Sterling Johnson Jr. of the Eastern District of New York, who was appointed by President Bush last year. He fixed a bond of $5,000. And he decided the case in favor of the refugees, ordering the Government to let the Yale students interview them and, meanwhile, not to send any back to Haiti.
Before an appeal could be heard, the Justice Department rushed to the Supreme Court and asked for an emergency stay of Judge Johnson's order. It claimed that the order had "fueled a nearly 20-fold increase in the number of Haitian migrants attempting to enter the United States illegally."
What was the basis for that extraordinary claim? All the Justice Department offered was an unsupported statement by a State Department official that in her "considered judgment" Judge Johnson's order had "contributed in significant part to the increased outflow of Haitians."
The Supreme Court voted 5 to 4 to issue a stay. The case is now before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.
A lawsuit that the trial judge decided in the plaintiffs' favor could hardly be "frivolous" but the Justice Department demand for sanctions on the lawyers is still there.
In its Supreme Court papers Justice relied on the 1950 case of Ellen Knauff, a war bride who was kept out of the United States as a security risk without being told why. The Supreme Court narrowly upheld that procedure. But the case aroused such outrage that the Attorney General changed his mind and let her in.
The Haitian refugees are asking for much less than Ellen Knauff: just the chance to see a lawyer. But it is worth recalling Justice Robert Jackson's dissent in the Knauff case:
"Security is like liberty in that many are the crimes committed in its name. The menace to the security of this country . . . is as nothing compared to the menace to free institutions inherent in procedures of this pattern."

HEADLINE: America's Urban Apartheid

BYLINE: By David Rusk; David Rusk, the former mayor of Albuquerque, N.M., is guest scholar at the Woodrow Wilson Center.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Stirred by the smoldering ashes of South-Central Los Angeles, a new generation of politicians is poised to make the same mistakes about cities, race and poverty that were made after the Watts riots 27 years ago. They do not realize that urban poverty can be overcome only by bringing down the walls between cities and suburbs.
Liberals appeal for large-scale Federal aid for inner-city social welfare and economic development -- the Big Buck strategy. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Jack Kemp, renews his call for inner-city enterprise zones, public housing "perestroika" and "empowerment" -- the Big Bootstrap strategy. 
 At heart, both the Big Buckers and Big Bootstrappers embrace the same views: Quarantine poor blacks and Hispanics in inner-city ghettoes and help them build from within. Both camps believe that separate can be made equal -- or at least equal enough to be tolerable.
But the 1990 census testifies to different truths. First, separate is invariably unequal. Second, the real city now is the total metropolitan area -- city and suburbs. According to the census, of the 200 largest metropolitan areas, about two-thirds follow the characteristic patterns of modern American urban apartheid.
Most poor blacks and Hispanics are penned up in inner cities. They are surrounded by suburbs that are at least 90 percent white. The number of jobs in the cities is declining, while suburban jobs grow. City incomes have dropped to 88 percent of suburban incomes. Public education has fragmented into multiple school systems, separating children by race and class.
But about 60 of the metropolitan areas have significantly lower levels of racial and economic segregation. A dozen of these are "cities without suburbs" like Albuquerque, N.M., Colorado Springs and Huntsville, Ala., which have aggressively annexed emerging suburbs. In such cities, typically 74 percent of the metropolitan population lives and pays taxes in the city (as against 33 percent for all other central cities). Incomes of city residents are 113 percent those of suburbanites. Public services and facilities are more adequate. City planning and zoning encourage affordable housing throughout the area. School districts are well integrated.
About 50 other metropolitan areas have developed almost without central cities. Places like Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood-Pompano Beach, Fla. and Vallejo-Fairfield-Napa, Cal. are really "suburbs without cities." Their dominant, unifying institutions are strong county governments and large, sometimes county-wide school systems. Low-income minorities have not been highly ghettoized, and middle class families have no place and no reason to flee. If the poor and middle class are not always neighbors, they are still taxpayers and citizens in common.
Why has this happened? In part, these metropolitan areas are newer, smaller and have had steady economic growth. But they are helped by unified city or county governments and public schools that link city and suburb.
How can older cities reverse their balkanization into racial and economic enclaves? It's unlikely to happen through local ballot boxes. It will be a rare white county commissioner or black city mayor with the vision and courage to challenge white fears or black community empowerment.
But the political power for reform exists -- in state capitals. Governors and state legislatures can consolidate fractionalized local governments and merge school districts. They can enact metropolitan area tax-sharing arrangements, affordable-housing quotas and state funding of local schools.
Utopian fantasies? Hardly. Somewhere in this country all of these strategies have been put into practice -- and they work. What's lacking is the political will to act. The "urban problem" is not some insurmountable economic given. It's the product of racism and classism. Los Angeles warns us again: It's long past time to start building that political will.

HEADLINE: Recognizing Macedonia Can Only Fuel Conflict

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "The Name Game in Macedonia" (editorial, May 15), similar to "The Two Macedonias" (editorial, April 5), you insist on the recognition of the "defenseless nation of two million Slavs, Albanians and Turks" with the name of Macedonia. This name was usurped by Stalin and Tito in 1945 for expansionary reasons in the Greek region of Macedonia, Aristotle's birthplace, and in the Aegean Sea. If it is not for future expansion, why don't the Skopjan leaders use a name related to their Slavic heritage, of which they should be proud?
After recognition of this tiny republic, Slav, Albanian, Greek, Bulgarian or Turkish minorities may try to join their neighboring mother countries and engage in bloody fighting similar to that of Bosnia. Such editorials may fuel further conflicts and the "Balkanization" of the area, which may be worse than the Lebanon strife, with the possible involvement of neighboring countries. 
 An effective policy may be to support an associated membership of the former Yugoslav republics in the European Community, steaming out ethnic conflicts, giving hope for economic and socio-political improvement and increasing U.S. trade and investment.

HEADLINE: To Solve Urban Crisis, New Version of W.P.A.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"The Los Angeles Law: Use It" (editorial, May 14) seems to hold that the solution to our urban crisis is putting more money into old programs that haven't succeeded.
Contrary to your suggestion that welfare recipients or the unemployed are not educationally or emotionally ready for stable jobs, the inner-city poor are ready and willing to work. Their only handicap is a welfare system that robs them of a sense of community and motivation. 
 Those people who once worked for the Works Progress Administration and the Civilian Conservation Corps can look back with pride on their tangible contributions to society. That sense of pride, of belonging, of learning a skill leading to gainful employment has been lost under our welfare system. Training and education are useful, but if no jobs are available they are of little help.
A bipartisan consensus is building for our proposal to bring back a modern version of the W.P.A. and C.C.C. Jobs would range from building parks to helping at hospitals or delivering meals to the elderly. As an added benefit, existing surplus military facilities and equipment as well as skilled military personnel being forced to take early retirement could be used in the program.
Increased financing for existing welfare and job-training programs alone is not the answer. What is needed is a new approach that looks at what has worked in the past. If we are to solve our urban crisis, we need to work our way out of it -- literally.

HEADLINE: Congressional Panel Votes to Keep at Least One Seawolf Submarine

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 20

 BODY:
A House-Senate conference committee voted today to save one of two Seawolf submarines President Bush had hoped to cut from the budget and to set aside an additional $550 million toward building either a second Seawolf or a smaller submarine.
The decision was a victory for the New England Congressional delegations, which struggled for more than a year to keep the submarine program alive and guarantee the continued operations of the General Dynamics Electric Boat shipyard in Groton, Conn. The shipyard provides more than 10,000 jobs. 
 The action on Seawolf was part of an overall-budget adjustment bill, known as a rescission, which would slash $7.1 billion from programs for which Congress had already appropriated money. The Congressional negotiators also agreed today to cut $500 million out of this year's budget appropriation for the B-2 stealth bomber and $200 million more from the Strategic Defense Initiative program.
"We came out a winner," said Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut. He said that Mr. Bush's proposal to cut more than $3 billion from this year's Seawolf budget had been "a death notice" for the shipyard. Under the conference committee's compromise, $1.15 billion would be carved from the program.
The House and Senate are expected to vote in favor of the committee decision within the next few days.
Mr. Dodd, like many liberal Democrats around the country, finds himself in the position of defending a military program that the Pentagon no longer supports. But salvaging the Seawolf, at least for a couple of years, is expected to help them make the case that they are fighting for local jobs.
Mr. Bush himself went to Congress last month to lobby against the Seawolf, after the Pentagon argued that dwindling dollars could be spent more wisely on other programs. The Seawolf is a stealth submarine that was designed to track a Soviet submarine fleet that is now in disarray.
The conference committee decision came as a compromise between the Senate, which wanted to salvage both Seawolf submarines, and the House, which wanted to save only one. House conferees remained steadfast against building two, in large part because the large California delegation would not have tolerated a deeper cut in the B-2 program, and there would not have been enough money to build two Seawolf submarines without further B-2 cutbacks.
 
Views on 'Star Wars'
 Meanwhile, Mr. Bush had promised to veto any bill that cut deeply into the Strategic Defense Initiative program, popularly known as "Star Wars."
The director of the "Star Wars" program, Henry F. Cooper, told the Senate Armed Services Committee today that Congress's order to rush a limited, ground-based anti-missile system into the field posed "a high risk" of delays and cost overruns.
Mr. Cooper said the risk in fielding the system by 1997 was "acceptable," but Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia and Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, both Democrats, criticized putting into effect any such high-risk program.
Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona and the leading opponent of the Seawolf in Congress, was sharply critical of the decision, calling it "a hare-brained scheme." He said he would urge Mr. Bush to veto the rescission bill and ask him to introduce an alternative bill to cut both Seawolf submarines again.
"You can never justify defense spending to create jobs because," said Mr. McCain.
Before the Soviet Union collapsed, the Administration had planned to build 29 Seawolf submarines. That number was reduced to three, then one.
One Seawolf is now being constructed. Under the conference committee compromise, a second $1.9 billion Seawolf would be built. Afterward, the Defense Department would have the option to apply an additional $550 million to a third Seawolf or to construct a Los Angeles-class nuclear submarine, a vessel the Seawolf was designed to replace.
Mr. Dodd said building the submarines would serve as "a bridge" until the region can convert its economy from military spending.
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Connecticut's other Democratic Senator, said the conference committee decision would preserve "our nation's capacity to produce submarines into the next century." He argued that by building the Seawolf submarines, the Groton plant would remain primed to build the next class of nuclear submarines, the Centurions, scheduled for the production line in 1998.
Mr. McCain said the Centurions could be built in another shipyard. "I'm not sure we will even need the Centurion," he said.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 23, 1992, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Thursday about Congressional action on the Seawolf submarine program quoted Senator John McCain incompletely. The Senator said, "You can never justify defense spending to create jobs because it's the most inefficient way to spend money."

HEADLINE: The Road To Rio -- Setting an Agenda for the Earth;
Homesteaders Gnaw at Brazil Rain Forest

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MARACA, Brazil

 BODY:
Bright green manioc plants sprouting among charred tree trunks and a constant hammering and sawing on house frames are signs that a new colony of homesteaders has arrived in this remote corner of the Amazon, an area covered only a year ago by tropical rain forest.
"I worked all my life as a sharecropper," explained Antonio Rodrigues dos Santos, a 38-year-old migrant from Brazil's impoverished northeast. "Now I have my own land," he added with satisfaction. With bulldozers standing by to resume road work when the dry season begins in June, the number of houses in this new town is expected to jump this year from 5 to 120. 
 Also in June, almost 2,000 miles south of here, 100 world leaders will meet in Rio de Janeiro for the so-called Earth Summit. To polish its environmental image, Brazil volunteered to serve as host of the meeting, officially titled the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development.
Now, Brazil is expected to point to statistics charting a steady fall in Amazon deforestation rates. But as the desolation here attests, the problem endures, fueled by commercial logging interests, a regional yearning for economic development and a land hunger among refugees from Brazil's poverty bowl, its overpopulated northeast.
After weathering heavy criticism over Amazon destruction in the late 1980's, Brazilians will issue statistics next month that indicate a 63 percent drop in annual deforestation rates in Brazil's Amazon since 1985. Encouraged by the new numbers, Brazil's Government recently reversed its position and decided to back adoption of a "Statement of Principles on Forests" at the Earth Summit.
Based on analysis of photographs taken by Landsat 5 satellites over the Amazon, researchers at Brazil's National Institute for Space Research calculate that the annual deforestation rate dropped from a high of 11,580 square miles in 1985 to 4,299 square miles in an annual period ending in August 1991.
"If last year's rate remains unchanged, it would take us 330 years to finish off the Amazon," said Luiz Gylvan Meira Filho, who directs the program at the institute near Sao Paulo. Seen as a pioneer in deforestation documentation, the institute is training research teams for the seven other nations of the Amazon basin -- Suriname, Guyana, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia.
Brazilian and United States scientists attribute the decline in forest burning rates to a series of factors: the suspension of tax incentives for ranching and logging projects in the Amazon, a sharp decline in the Brazilian economy, a public information campaign coupled with fines levied against violators of forest laws, and rainfall during traditional burning seasons.
"I have no reason to doubt the numbers," Philip M. Fearnside, a United States ecologist in Manaus and a frequent critic of Brazilian Government policies, said. "The main reason for the drop in burning is the economy."
 
10% of Amazon Forest Lost
 Dr. Fearnside calculates that about 10 percent of the forest cover of Brazil's Amazon has been removed. Measuring 1.9 million square miles, Brazil's portion of the Amazon -- 60 percent of the total -- stretches over a land mass equal to the United States east of the Mississippi.
But, with an Amazon forest area twice the size of Delaware going up in smoke last year, scientists warn that dangers to the forest are still strong, especially at the edges.
Out of this huge area, the southeast corner of Amapa state offers a microcosm of the region's pressures and of the players: a new road bringing homesteaders from Brazil's overpopulated and destitute northeast, a large wood pulp company seeking to expand operations, and local unionists joining with United States and European environmentalists to preserve a forest area larger than Rhode Island for 2,000 families who live off the land.
A frontier territory that became a state in 1988, Amapa had the third fastest population growth rate -- 4.5 percent -- of Brazil's 27 states and territories in the 1980's. The two states with higher rates -- Rondonia and Roraima -- are also in the Amazon.
"We are finally living the way God intended," Mariane dos Santos Castro, a 37-year-old settler and mother of six, said in their two-room palm-thatched shack built near the new road, BR-156. "Before we didn't earn enough to pay for a children's pair of shoes."
 
Homesteaders Stake Claims
 Her husband, Otacilio Pereira da Silva, said that after moving to Amapa from Brazil's drought stricken state of Ceara, he had struggled for years working the land of others. Last year, when road graders started smoothing a new 100-mile road from Macapa, the state capital, to the state border at Jari River, he staked a claim to 250 acres.
Today, in fields marked by gray skeletons of jungle trees, he grows corn and manioc. To earn some cash, he hopes to work in this dry season for a timber company that has applied for permission to cut logs in the nearby Cajari Extractive Reserve.
The federally financed road, a line of graded dirt through thick forest, enjoys powerful political backing in the state. One Amapa senator, Henrique Almeida, is part owner of the construction company, C.R. Almeida. Another Amapa senator, Jose Sarney, who is a former President of Brazil, won election to Congress 18 months ago by promising residents along the Jari River that he would end their isolation.
 
3 Hours From the Movies
 Euclides Reckziegel, head of forestry management at the Jari tree farm, 75 miles west of here, said, "We will be only three hours from restaurants, movie theaters, car dealerships and Macapa's new free trade zone."
Remo Scalabrin, operations manager at Jari, agreed. "Even though the road goes through our land, we aren't against it," he said. "You can't be against the march of history."
Dissenting voices are rare and not very popular in this frontier land. Development advocates complain that 35 percent of Amapa state is off bounds to economic exploitation -- protected by Indian reservations, extractive reserves, national and state parks.
Pedro Ramos, a state representative to the National Council of Rubber Tappers, opposes paving the road. A few days before the environmental hearing, two men visited the union leader at his house and beat him severely with wooden clubs.
The attack drew public protests from United States, Canadian and German environmental groups who are helping the union assert control over the reserve, which begins 20 miles west of here on the new road.
 
Minority Opposes Road
 "I'm against the road," said Elson Martins da Silveira, a Macapa newspaper editor, voicing a minority opinion. "The history of roads in the Amazon is that the Government builds them without a development plan and it becomes a path for disordered growth."
Calixto Pinto de Souza, president of the Cajari Reserve Association, added: "We can't let in people who will disrupt the forest. They can't be trusted. They will have 10 children, and then will want more land."
Mr. de Souza said he has received death threats, not only for insisting that strict controls be placed on road traffic through the reserve, but also for opposing an application by the Jari project to deforest 20 miles of native forest to plant eucalyptus.
Founded by a United States investor in 1967, the Jari project claims title to 6,500 square miles of contiguous forest in Para and Amapa -- an area larger than Connecticut and Rhode Island. Now Brazilian-owned, the company finds that Government opinion in Brasilia has shifted against large projects in the Amazon.
The new president of Brazil's environmental protection agency has said she will not issue a logging permit.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Sales Tax Cut 1 Cent As G.O.P. Overrides Florio Veto

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, May 21

 BODY:
The Republican majority in the New Jersey Legislature overrode Gov. Jim Florio's veto today and made good on their promise to cut the penny from the state sales tax that the Democrats put there two years ago.
The Republicans said they were acting to protect the taxpayers and spur the economy in reducing the sales tax to 6 cents a dollar from 7 and producing the largest tax cut in New Jersey history, $608 million in next year's budget. 
The Democrats charged that it was irresponsible to reduce the tax without specifying what would be cut to make up the revenue and they argued that property-tax payers, mass transit riders and the elderly would inevitably be hurt.
 
First Overriding in a Decade
 The overriding of the Governor's veto, the first in a decade, passed comfortably, 59 to 9 in the Assembly, five more votes than needed, and 29 to 2 in the Senate, two more than needed in that house. One Democrat joined with the Republican majority in the Assembly and two in the Senate to override the veto. The last such action was in 1982 when Gov. Thomas H. Kean's veto of a bill to allow a moment of silence in the schools was overridden, but later struck down by the courts.
Governor Florio pronounced himself "happy to see taxes go down," but added, "People all over the state have been saying, slow down and make sure this is a good deal."
"Now," he said, "the Legislature begins the job of cutting $1 billion. I join with the people of the state in awaiting the results of that effort."
The Assembly Speaker, Garabed (Chuck) Haytaian, said that his party's proposed cuts would be on the Governor's desk for his consideration by early June.
Republican leaders have hinted that a chief target is the one of the Governor's favorite programs, homestead rebates for homeowners and renters, budgeted at $685 million for next year. The Republicans are expected to cut at least half of that.
Other items that may face cuts include aid to cities and towns, aid to mass transit and the jobs of state employees, especially middle managers.
Some critics of the rollback, particularly the elderly, observe that the 1-cent reduction would amount to less than $77 per capita. That amount, they maintain, is not enough to make up for what are likely to be substantial reductions in homestead rebates that now range up to $500.
Senate President Donald T. DiFrancesco of Scotch Plains said the tax reduction and the overriding of the Governor's veto had redeemed the first part of the Republican Party's pledge to reduce taxes and spending. In November the party swept to veto-proof majorities in both houses on the strength of resentment over the record tax increase rushed through the Legislature in 1990 by Governor Florio and the Democrats.
"Next," Mr. DiFrancesco said, "we are preparing to fulfill our second commitment to the people of New Jersey by delivering a budget that will reduce the size of state government."
The Republicans have vowed not only to cut from the budget the $608 million in lost revenues that will result from the sales-tax reduction, but also to cut another $400 million, for a total of $1 billion. That would reduce Mr. Florio's proposed budget for the fiscal year that starts on July 1 from $15.7 billion to $14.7 billion.
 
'Political Gamesmanship'
 To make those cuts, the Florio administration made clear, the Republicans are on their own. Secretary of State Daniel Dalton, himself the former Democratic Senate majority leader, called the rollback "a farce" and "political gamesmanship."
The outcome was a foregone conclusion since Wednesday, when the last Republican holdout in the Senate, Henry P. McNamara of Franklin Lakes, announced that he would vote to override. Mr. McNamara had abstained from voting for the original repeal when it was passed by an overwhelming majority six weeks ago because of concerns that he did not know what programs would be cut to make up the difference.
In explaining his decision to override, he said: "I now realize that Governor Florio is committed to keeping things the way they are, the way they have been. He believes beyond a shadow of a doubt that 'good' government means government which keeps spending more and more of working people's money."
"The people who work hard and pay the taxes have had enough. They want a change," he said.
 
Joined by One Democrat
 There had never been any doubt that the Republicans would achieve the overriding in the Assembly, where they hold 58 seats to the Democrats' 22, four more than needed to override. They did, joined by one Democrat, Robert G. Smith of Piscataway. Mr. Smith is running for the Democratic nomination for the House of Representatives in the Sixth Congressional District against Frank Pallone Jr., an incumbent with a record of opposing taxes.
Twelve other Democrat voted to support the Governor's veto, and the nine others abstained.
In the Senate, two Democrats, Raymond J. Zane of Woodbury and John H. Adler of Haddonfield, joined with the Republicans in voting to override the veto.
With the outcome ordained, so was the debate, but with the presence of television cameras from New Jersey Network on the floor and the vote itself being considered historic, few legislators passed up the opportunity to speak. The Assembly debate that began shortly after 10 in the morning thus stretched three and a half hours into the afternoon.
Democrats dwelt on the refusal of Republicans to talk about what programs, services and jobs they planned to cut and who would be hurt, and the Republicans dwelt on the need for fiscal restraint and a curb on unbridled spending.
Assembly Speaker Haytaian, of Hackettstown, repeatedly warned Democrats to stick to the issue at hand, which he maintained was the tax cut itself, while Democrats repeatedly raised the question, "Who gets hurt?"
Though the debate in the Assembly was partisan, it was amiable.
At one point, when he was cautioned several times by Mr. Haytaian not to stray from the tax cut itself, Assemblyman Louis A. Romano of West New York said, "I would remind the Speaker that I was the only member of the Assembly who stayed to the end during his speech to the Jewish war veterans."
Mr. Haytaian replied, "That's why I haven't ruled you out of order already."
 
Brief Partisan Burst
 Things were a bit less amiable in the Senate. Senator Randy Corman of Sayreville, for example, in one brief burst of partisanship, called the Governor's conditional veto "a diabolically clever example of cynical political hardball," "a fraud and a farce," "irresponsible," "malevolent" and "a devious document."
For their part, Democrats like the assistant Senate minority leader, Richard A. Cody of West Orange, accused the Republicans of "operating under the cover of darkness" and being "afraid to tell the truth" about what they planned to cut from the budget.
Similarly, John A. Lynch of New Brunswick, the former Democratic Senate President and now the minority leader, accused the Republicnas of embarking on "a mystery saga with a surprise ending."

HEADLINE: U.S., IN NEW POLICY, WILL NOT PICK UP ALL HAITI REFUGEES

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 21

 BODY:
With refugee centers at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base filled to capacity, the Administration announced today that the Coast Guard would no longer pick up all the Haitians fleeing their country in rickety boats for the United States.
The Coast Guard said that people in boats bobbing in Caribbean waters would be asked first to return to Haiti. But it acknowledged the possibility that more Haitians might sail to Florida, risking drowning and posing new problems for United States officials who worry that a tide of refugees will overwhelm the state's social services.
 
Embargo Is Questioned
 The new policy, described as part of a re-examination of the Administration's procedures for Haitian refugees, reflects a growing feeling among officials that the embargo against Haiti is doing little more than ruining the country's economy and motivating masses of poor people to emigrate. Officials say they fear that in picking up the refugees just off the Haitian coast, the United States is encouraging more and more Haitians to flee. 
 "Our hope is that people won't put to sea and risk their lives," said Richard Boucher, a State Department spokesman.
Under the new Coast Guard procedures, if a ship commander decides that a boatload of refugees is in no "imminent danger" -- that the vessel is strong enough and contains enough food and water for the voyage to Florida -- he will not pick them up.
Rather, officers will encourage the Haitians to sail back to Haiti, although an Administration official said "the incentives and disincentives have not been totally worked out." However, the Coast Guard said it did not have the authority to force a boat in international waters to return to Haiti.
 
Base Closed to New Refugees
 The Coast Guard announcement came shortly after Pentagon officials decided they could not accept any more refugees at the tent camps at the naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, because of the strain on its water, electrical and sewage systems. The Coast Guard will now process any new refugees on seven cutters patrolling off the Haitian coast. Three additional patrol boats are on their way to provide extra space for those who are newly rescued.
The Coast Guard said the patrol boats could reach the waters off Haiti by tonight.
Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, where the Coast Guard has housed nearly 250 new refugees a day in recent weeks, reached its maximum capacity after three Coast Guard cutters unloaded 400 Haitians picked up on Wednesday. The 10,404 rescued in May is a one-month record since President Jean-Bertrand Aristide of Haiti was overthrown in an army coup in September.
More than 12,000 refugees are currently crammed into the base, including 1,100 who have been denied asylum and are awaiting their return to Haiti. More than 100 are processed and forcibly returned every day.
The Coast Guard estimates that it has picked up 34,090 Haitians from 461 vessels since Oct. 29. It says it has no estimates of the number who may have drowned in attempting the crossing to Florida.
Some 10,000 who have fled Haiti since the coup, or about a third of the total, have received asylum or otherwise been approved for entry into the United States, and 13,918 have been repatriated, including 259 today.
It is the sizable number accepted by the United States that is encouraging Haitians to board their boats in hopes of being rescued and taken to Guantanamo. A State Department official said the Coast Guard was announcing its new policy with some fanfare so "Haitians will know" and be discouraged from sailing.
"If we determine that they're not in imminent distress, and they are in international waters," said Petty Officer Joe Dye, a Coast Guard spokesman in Miami, "we're strongly encouraging them to turn around and go back to Haiti. We're not picking up every vessel we come across."
He said that if the Coast Guard found a leaking boat, "we will take immediate action to save their lives."
 
Repeated Flights Noted
 Officials noted that the new policy was mostly intended to deter Haitians who sail out just beyond the 12-mile limit of their country's waters and wait there hoping they will be picked up by the Coast Guard and taken to Guantanamo for immigration processing. When they are not picked up, the officials said, they usually return to Haiti on their own.
Petty Officer Dye noted that many Haitian refugees had been picked up "two or three times," taken to Guantanamo, and returned to Haiti. "They say it's better in Guantanamo Bay then it is in Haiti," he added.
He said the Coast Guard knew of no Haitian refugee vessel to have reached the United States since October 1990, although a few had landed in the Bahamas. He said two boats had capsized in Cuban waters, resulting in an unknown number pf drownings.
State Department officials said the Administration was considering a variety of ways to modify its repatriation policy, but they were vague on their options. One official said there was little likelihood that the Administration would stop accepting political refugees since that would contradict international law.
"The options are about what do you do with people in transit and what do you do with people screened out and waiting to go back," a State Department official said.
 
Four Killed in Capital
 Seeking to explain the new surge in Haitian emigration, officials noted that weather and sea current patterns in recent weeks had been favorable for crossings.
The political tensions that have buffeted Haiti since the coup have not subsided, and there appears no end to the confrontation between the army and the impoverished masses who still support Father Aristide.
In Haiti today, soldiers poured into the streets of Port-au-Prince to disperse protesters who had set up barricades of old tires. Four people were killed in separate incidents, Reuters reported.
Anti-Government forces are trying to get a general strike under way. Many schools closed today and traffic around the capital was light, but a crackdown by security forces appears to be intimidating many from taking part in the strike.
The flight of Haitians has been accompanied by an effort by American civil liberties and refugee groups to permit as many as possible to remain in this country. State Department officials are critical of the Immigration and Naturalization Service for granting political asylum to such a high percentage of Haitian refugees, insisting that the vast majority are leaving their country for economic and not political reasons.
The Pentagon is also unhappy because the overcrowding at Guantanamo has burdened the base, which is built on land leased from Cuba, and provided a propaganda opening for the Castro Government.

HEADLINE: SMOKING DECLINES AT A FASTER PACE

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: ATLANTA, May 21

 BODY:
Smoking in the United States has reached its lowest level in 37 years because of health concerns, the increasing cost of cigarettes and public smoking restrictions, Federal health officials said today.
The Centers for Disease Control reported that 25.5 percent of adult Americans smoked in 1990, the latest year for which figures are available. That is the lowest since the agency began monitoring smoking in 1955. 
 "This tells us that Americans are responding perhaps in even greater numbers to the public health education campaign that's occurring," said Dr. Gary Giovino, the chief smoking epidemiologist at the centers.
 
Decline Becomes Steeper
 The percentage of Americans who smoke has been decreasing at a rate of 1.1 percentage points a year since 1987, more than double the rate of decrease from 1965 to 1985. If the rate continues, the country will meet its national health objective of reducing the rate to 15 percent of Americans by the year 2000, the agency said.
"An awareness of the health consequences, the increased cost of cigarettes and the declining social acceptance all contributed to this," Dr. Giovino said.
The Atlanta-based agency surveyed 40,666 people in 1990. The prevalence of smoking was highest among American Indians, high school dropouts and people ages 25 to 44. The lowest levels were people over age 75 (6.5 percent) and college graduates (13.5 percent).
 
Decline Among Women
 The sharpest declines occurred along lines of race and sex.
From 1965 through 1985, 39 percent to 45 percent of women ages 20-24 who had a high school education or less smoked. In 1990, the percentage dropped to 33.4.
In 1965, 43 percent of blacks smoked; it was down to 26.2 percent in 1990.
Economics and social acceptability also played crucial roles in the decline, Dr. Giovino said.
The average cost of cigarettes jumped from 23 cents a pack in 1955, when 42 percent of Americans smoked, to $1.74 last year. The average smoker puffs 19.1 cigarettes a day, just less than a pack a day.
Social acceptability can be measured in part by clean-air policies, Dr. Giovino said.
Forty-four states and the District of Columbia have instituted some form of smoking restrictions in public places, and 85 percent of employers had workplace smoking policies last year, compared with 54 percent in 1987.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Study Cites Death Toll
 LONDON, May 21 (AP) -- Cigarettes will kill one in five people in industrialized countries, according to a worldwide analysis based on American studies of smoking.
The study is being published in Saturday's issue of The Lancet, a British medical journal.
"It had been thought about a quarter of smokers died from smoking-related deaths," said Prof. Richard Peto, the leading investigator at the Imperial Cancer Research Center at Oxford University. "Now we know at least a third of smokers, and maybe closer to a half of smokers, die from it."
Tobacco has been linked with increased risks of cancers of the lung, mouth, pharynx, larynx, esophagus, kidney, and bladder. Smokers are also at increased risk of heart disease, emphysema and other chronic lung ailments.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Politics of Morality;
Speech by Quayle on Family Values Raises Questions About Thrust of Bush Campaign

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 21

 BODY:
Vice President Dan Quayle and his staff were clearly delighted by the stir he caused with his gibe at Murphy Brown, but the underlying question is whether the ensuing debate on family values was good for the 1992 Republican Presidential ticket or just for Mr. Quayle.
The Vice President's speech, delivered during a three-day political swing that was carefully planned to generate as much publicity as possible, clearly had aims beyond its stated purpose of sparking a national debate on marriage, child-rearing, poverty and other social issues. 
 Republican strategists said it was intended as political shock therapy for a White House political team that many Republicans, including some close to Mr. Quayle, believe to be asleep at the wheel. According to their accounts, Mr. Quayle wanted to demonstrate that it is possible to seize control of an important issue, rather than to continue to drift while Ross Perot gains in the polls.
The White House is increasingly concerned about Mr. Perot's outsider candidacy, but it is also uncertain about how Mr. Bush, a lifelong politician and Washington insider, can counter it.
Mr. Quayle was also trying to demonstrate that it is possible to short circuit Mr. Perot and his followers by stealing their anti-establishment thunder with blasts at fat targets like the press and what the Vice President is calling the "cultural elite" of the entertainment industry.
The upside of all this for Mr. Quayle is easy to see. By casting himself as the energy source of a struggling campaign, Mr. Quayle furthers his ongoing repair work on his political image and his efforts to lay the groundwork for a Presidential campaign in 1996.
But what is good for Mr. Quayle, as he tightens his bond with the political and cultural right, may not be good for his boss, who will not be back in the White House if he loses mainstream Democrats and independents to Mr. Perot or to Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the likely Democratic nominee.
Mr. Quayle's clear ideological focus and aggressive attack on the family-values front only highlighted the President's diffuse message and the hesitancy and confusion that have been evident in its response to a series of political challenges this year. Yesterday, Mr. Bush and his press secretary were in the embarrassing position of not being sure how to deal with the political offensive of the President's own running mate.
"It may be another sign of the President's weakness that they can't figure out how to respond to Dan Quayle, much less to the riots in L.A. and the economy," said Harrison Hickman, a Democratic poll taker.
 
Clinging to the Center
 More broadly, while any incumbent President must hold the center to win re-election, that seems an even greater imperative for Mr. Bush as he tries to keep recession-weary voters from turning to the Democratic Party and to stop Democrats who voted for Ronald Reagan from defecting to Mr. Perot.
That could become harder if Mr. Quayle helps to drive the Bush campaign too far to the right. But Kevin Phillips, the Republican commentator, said Mr. Quayle's actions in California suggested another possibility: that the Bush campaign is expecting a three-way race in which the winner could have less than 50 percent of the vote, and is thus trying to appeal to a narrower audience.
"I think the Murphy Brown flap is good for Quayle," he said. "I think it's possibly to the detriment of Bush in the medium term, and I think the long-term prospects for Republicans are negative because they're into a calculated narrowing mode."
Mr. Quayle and his aides said they laid out their plans for the California trip with the specific intent of getting as much attention as possible from the Vice President's speech on family values. Mr. Quayle is said to have inserted the reference to Murphy Brown, the television comedy character who bore a child out of wedlock.
"Maybe the best thing to do is to take it at face value, which is, he wants people to talk about family values and this is a way of doing it," said Richard Fenno, a professor of political science at the University of Rochester who wrote a book about Mr. Quayle's Senate career.
 
Focusing on Hollywood
 But Administration officials acknowledged that for reasons of political tactics, Mr. Quayle is also trying to make the case that he stood with "ordinary Americans" against an established power that does not care about the same things they do.
"It's clear there is a very large number of voters who say the country is on the wrong track," said one Republican strategist. "That is going to turn against the incumbent pretty quickly unless you can show you're for change. What Quayle did in California fits into that pattern by focusing the 'what's wrong' feeling on Hollywood."
The Vice President pressed that attack today as he told reporters that he "wouldn't change one word of the speech" he delivered on Tuesday. "I'm sure that the media elite and Hollywood didn't like the speech that I gave," he said. "But the American people support what I'm talking about, and I'm talking about values."
Some Republicans, like Gary Bauer, head of the Family Planning Council, an anti-abortion group, said Mr. Bush should follow his Vice President's lead.
"The West Wing could do themselves a big favor by running with the larger theme of the breakdown of the family for the next week or so," Mr. Bauer said. "I think it's one of those things that will make their lives miserable by producing all sorts of turmoil, but I have no doubt it would resonate to the American people."
But he and others said it was not clear whether the White House was prepared to do that.
"Bush should give a speech like this," said Steven Merksamer, who ran the Bush-Quayle campaign in California in 1988 and traveled with Mr. Quayle this week. "Whether he can do that or not, given where he is coming from ideologically, is another question."
Mr. Quayle himself was diplomatically circumspect on this question. "It was a speech that needed to be given," he said.

HEADLINE: In Challenge to Bush, Senate Adds $1.4 Billion to Urban Aid Bill

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 21

 BODY:
The Senate today passed an urban aid measure that dared President Bush not to spend $1.45 billion more than he said was needed in the aftermath of the violence in Los Angeles.
Mr. Bush supports a bill, passed by the House last week, that would have provided $822 million in loans and grants for disaster relief and small business loans for cities, since reserves for both were low even before the Los Angeles riot and the Chicago flood. 
 But by a vote of 61 to 36, the Senate today adopted a proposal by Senators Edward M. Kennedy and Orrin G. Hatch that took the House bill and expanded it. The Senate bill added $700 million for summer youth jobs, $250 million for a summer Head Start program, $250 million for summer school for disadvantaged students and $250 million for the Justice Department's "weed and seed" program of tougher law enforcement and community development.
The Administration's response was cagey, stopping well short of threatening a veto. While Mr. Bush has insisted that he would oppose a bigger urban aid package than the one he favors, the White House Office of Management and Budget suggested it might trade acceptance of more spending on the existing programs in the Kennedy-Hatch measure for Congressional compliance with some of its proposals.
Big-city Democratic mayors, meanwhile, were meeting with Congressional leaders for a second time since the riots. Mayor Raymond L. Flynn of Boston, chairman of the United States Conference of Mayors, called the Senate bill "a small down payment.
Mr. Kennedy, a Massachusetts Democrat, and Mr. Hatch, a Utah Republican, had sought to take advantage of the sudden concern for urban problems.
The biggest percentage increase for one program was for the Justice Department program; its spending would increase more than 20 times, to $250 million from $12 million. The biggest absolute increase would be for summer jobs, adding $700 million to $683 million.
The two Senators argued that these four measures should be added as emergency spending because if the money was not put out immediately, it could not be spent this summer. But they and others have argued that the $1.45 billion is only a first step.
But as passed by the Senate, the bill would not actually require Mr. Bush to spend the $1.45 billion unless he made a formal declaration of a budget emergency, which is required under the 1990 budget act before the deficit can be increased. Mr. Bush had already agreed to an emergency declaration for the $822 million in loans and grants in the House version of the bill.
The statement of Administration policy from the budget office called it unhelpful "to advance funding increases for non-disaster programs without also addressing the crucial issues of reform."
That suggested a willingness to consider the spending measures if Congress were also to move on Administration proposals.
No tax measure can be attached to a spending bill. But if the dealing gets complicated and serious, the enterprise zone legislation could be added to a bill extending emergency unemployment benefits and making permanent changes in the unemployment law that the House Ways and Means Committee approved today.
Whether or not the dealing goes that far, the measure passed today by the Senate stands a good chance of quick acceptance by the House.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Democrats;
Clinton Sees Bush Engaging In Empty Talk on Families

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CLEVELAND, May 21

 BODY:
Adding his voice to the theme of family values that has occupied President Bush and Vice President Quayle this week, Gov. Bill Clinton said the White House had engaged in "cynical election-year politics" designed to avoid taking a leadership role in resolving the problems of families.
Mr. Clinton called a speech the Vice President gave on Tuesday a symptom of the Bush Administration's inability to take actions on the problems that affect cities and those living in poverty. 
 In his speech, Mr. Quayle said the nation was experiencing a "poverty of values" and assailed television character Murphy Brown's single motherhood.
Mr. Clinton said Mr. Quayle's speech ignored "the relationship of our family problems to our economic decline, holds out Murphy Brown as a bigger problem than TV's crass commercialism and glorification of selfishness and violence, and denies the Administration's responsibility to face the full range of America's staggering family problems."
The Governor's speech today was a distillation of weeks of speeches and comments he has made since the Los Angeles riots about the declines of cities and families. In it, he detailed his positions on social issues like family-leave legislation, abortion, welfare changes and child support.
 
Quayle's Remarks Help Clinton
 Mr. Clinton, whose place in the political spotlight has dimmed in recent weeks, benefited today from the reflected glare of publicity over Mr. Quayle's remarks. Acknowledging that the subject of family values "has acquired more currency," the Governor attempted to define the term as a matter of "governmental philosophy" rather than political opportunity.
"It isn't enough for America's leaders to blame past social programs on current TV programs," he said. "It isn't enough for America to change channels. We need to change course."
Mr. Clinton also used the opportunity to describe his own family values, recalling his impoverished upbringing as the son of a woman who has been widowed three times. For a portion of his childhood, Mr. Clinton was raised by his grandparents. His father died in a car accident before he was born.
 
Shares Family Attitudes
 He also spoke extensively of the involvement of his wife, Hillary, with child-welfare issues and of his own experiences raising his daughter Chelsea, who is 12 years old.
Mr. Clinton's advisers have been concerned that voters seem to know little about him beyond the questions that have been raised about his character. They have sought in recent weeks to re-introduce him to voters as a caring public servant who will bring an outsider's perspective to national problems that the Bush Administration has ignored.
"Family values can't simply be Washington code for Beltway Republicans who really mean you're on your own, or Beltway Democrats who want to spend more of your tax money on programs that don't embody your values," Mr. Clinton said.
He said that the nation's social problems could only be resolved by working to find "a third way, beyond the traditional politics of both parties."
"Family values alone won't feed a hungry child, and material security cannot provide a moral compass," Mr. Clinton said. "We must have both."
President Bush, in a commencement speech delivered at the University of Notre Dame on Sunday, said the American family was "an institution under siege" and that its problems must be addressed "at the personal, individual level for governmental programs to be effective."
Mr. Quayle, in his toughly worded San Francisco speech two days later, decried a "welfare ethos" in the nation's poorer communities, and he said the country was "reaping the whirlwind of decades of changes in social mores."
Mr. Clinton said today that he agreed with the White House that there is a "values crisis" in America, but he said the Bush Administration has taken no action to address it.
Noting that President Theodore Roosevelt once called the Presidency a "bully pulpit," he said Mr. Bush had abdicated his responsibility to use his words to "move a nation."
"But talk must be backed up with action or we risk diminishing the bully pulpit to a pulpit of bull," Mr. Clinton said.
 
Reiterates Social Policies
 Consolidating several of his previously stated policy positions in today's remarks to a business crowd at the Cleveland City Club, he called for an earned-income tax credit for the working poor whose incomes fall above the Federal poverty line.
He also reiterated his call for welfare changes, saying that job training, day-care vouchers and medical coverage should be provided for welfare recipients to allow them to return to the work force.
"People want the dignity of work," Mr. Clinton said. "We should give everyone a chance to have that dignity."
After two years on welfare, recipients should perform public service work if they cannot find jobs, Mr. Clinton said.
The Governor also called for tougher enforcement of child-support payments, including releasing to credit-rating agencies the names of fathers who do not make court-ordered payments, and instituting a national collection system administered by the Internal Revenue Service.
Mr. Clinton also said he would sign a Federal law allowing for parental leave and provide money in the budget to pay for the Head Start preschool program.
Mr. Clinton received the longest applause when he said he would support abortion rights as a matter of "preserving personal and family privacy." He described abortion as a matter of choice and linked it to Mr. Bush's support of Federally supported tuition vouchers that would allow parents to choose what school their children can attend, whether public or private.
"The President says he wants private school choice even if it means taking public money away from public schools that are already underfunded," he said. "He's willing to make it a crime for a woman to exercise her right to make the most private choice of all. I don't understand that."
Mr. Clinton was not able to remain on the subject of family values entirely today. During a question-and-answer period that followed the speech, he was asked to participate in 15 seconds of silence in memory of Roger Keith Coleman, the Virginia man who was executed on Wednesday.
"I think you and others should properly pray for his soul," he said after a few seconds' silence. "I do not know what the facts are in the case. But I do not believe we should abolish the death penalty."

'Hooray for Senor Dinkins!' And the Mayor Says, Well, Not Much

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic, May 21

 BODY:
Before leaving the Caribbean for New York today, Mayor David N. Dinkins took some time away from the pomp and circumstance dominating his short visit here to concentrate on the problems plaguing a nation with strong ties to his city.
After receiving an honorary degree from the Universidad Autonoma de Santo Domingo for his work on the behalf of Dominicans, Mr. Dinkins made an impromptu visit to Villa Juana, one of the poorest sections of Santo Domingo, where he was cheered by residents who ran out of their shacks to greet him. 
 Thirty percent of the adults in this country are unemployed and those who do have jobs earn an average of $30 a month. Health care, housing, education seem woefully inadequate.
"Hurray for Mr. Dinkins! Hurray for Mr. Dinkins!" people yelled as the Mayor pressed through the crowd shaking hands and kissing babies.
"I see many of the faces here that I see on 158th Street and Broadway," Mr. Dinkins said, referring to the large Dominican population in Washington Heights.
Mr. Dinkins announced a "sister city" exchange program this morning in which New York City would train Dominican health care professionals at city hospitals and donate used medical equipment to hospitals and clinics in Santo Domingo.
Such equipment could include beds, respirators, X-ray machines and diagnostic equipment. City officials said that while the equipment, much of it sitting in warehouses, is no longer appropriate for hospitals in New York, it would be useful here.
Later the Mayor visited a children's hospital, where he passed out stuffed animals before heading to the airport to fly back to New York. He arrived at about 8:30, ending a three-day trip began in Puerto Rico on Monday.
 
No Habla Espanol
 It has become quite clear in the last three days that Mayor David N. Dinkins and his Hispanic associates do not speak the same language. Mr. Dinkins has struggled to speak Spanish throughout his trip, often mispronouncing the names of dignitaries and his own staff members.
At a news conference with Gov. Rafael Hernandez-Colon of Puerto Rico, Mr. Dinkins grossly mispronounced the name of the founder of the Puerto Rican Commonwealth government, Luis Munoz Marin, , and the Mayor repeatedly dropped part of the Governor's name, referring to him as Governor Colon. Following Spanish custom, the Governor uses both his parents' surnames.
Later Mr. Dinkins needed help pronouncing adoquines to refer to the cobblestones he presented to the Governor to repave a historic road in Old San Juan. The Mayor was also overheard saying "MUC-hass GRAC-hass" for "MOO-chas GRAH-see-ass," or "thank you."
As one local journalist suggested, "El Gringo needs to wear a sign that reads 'No habla espanol.' "
Mr. Dinkins also offered a dry comment on his language "skills" during his speech accepting his honorary degree from the Universidad Autonoma: "I'm listening carefully to my translator to make sure he does not make any mistakes."
A spokeswoman for the Mayor, Anabel Franceschini, said she and the Mayor were working to improve his pronunciation and have made a wager that by the time he returns to the Caribbean, he will sound like a native.
 
Concern for Gypsy Cabs
 Many citizens of the Dominican Republic depend heavily on support from relatives in the United States. New York City has between 150,000 and 500,000 residents of Dominican ancestry who send about $500 million a year back to their homeland.
That explains why local reporters told Mayor Dinkins of growing concern that gypsy-cab drivers in New York are increasingly the targets of discrimination and violence. Many of the 20,000 Dominicans who emigrate to New York each year drive cabs.
Responding to their concern, Mr. Dinkins said that his administration does not tolerate bias of any kind and that New York City's Taxi and Limousine Commission would soon announce a program to more effectively regulate the taxi industry, which would benefit Dominicans.
Under the proposal, first put forward in January, the city would issue a new class of medallion that would allowing gypsy cabs to pick up people who hail them on the street outside Manhattan's central business district.

HEADLINE: House Data on U.S. Income Sets Off Debate on Fairness

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 21

 BODY:
In what has become a rite of spring, Congress today published 1,888 pages of eye-straining social welfare statistics and set off a brawl about the fairness of American society.
The statistics are featured in a bound volume called the Green Book, which has been published annually by the House Ways and Means Committee since 1981. The book has drawn the ire of some conservatives in recent years for data that show widening differences in American incomes. 
 Many liberals, in Congress and in universities, have said the data show that America is becoming increasingly unfair, with the rich reaping windfalls while others tread water or sink.
 
Debate on Income Distribution
 A few Congressional conservatives have said that the data are simply wrong. Last year, Representative Dick Armey, Republican of Texas, denounced it as a "data base for demagogues." Many other analysts have accepted the numbers but put their own twists on them, in what is becoming an ever-larger, and politically charged, debate about income distribution.
This year's episode centers on the question of work effort: Do the poor work enough or do they not?
One table shows that, despite popular images of the idle poor, the poorest fifth of Americans worked 4.6 percent more in 1989 than in the previous decade. But because of sinking wages and Government benefits, their incomes in that same period fell by 4.1 percent.
By contrast, the richest fifth worked an extra 2 percent but saw their incomes soar 19.6 percent.
"It says that the rules of the game are rigged against those with fewer skills: they worked harder and they made less," said Representative Thomas J. Downey, the Long Island Democrat who is chairman of an influential Ways and Means subcommittee.
While work effort may have increased, said Lawrence M. Mead, a political scientist at New York University, it remains quite modest, with the poor working many fewer hours than those further up the income ladder.
In 1989, for instance, members of the poorest fifth of American families worked a total of 850 hours. Those in the middle fifth worked an average of 2,550 hours. And those in the upper fifth worked even more, 3,510 hours.
A typical full-time worker, on the job 40 hours a week for 50 weeks a year, would log 2,000 hours.
"The poor have a whole lot of room to increase their work effort -- a whole lot," said Mr. Mead.
But Mr. Downey said it was often harder for poor families to increase their work effort. Often, he said, they can only find part-time or sporadic work or cannot afford the child care to leave home. And since many poor families are headed by single mothers, they cannot send a second earner into the work force, as many more affluent families do.
The Green Book shows that the poorest single mothers actually worked 6 percent less in 1989 than they did a decade earlier. But their incomes dropped by 17 percent, mostly because of cuts in welfare benefits.
Where both sides agree is that a disproportionate amount of the new prosperity brought by the 1980's went to the most privileged.
At the heart of the widening gap are changes in wage patterns, which have punished the unskilled while gilding the Guccis of the best-educated.
The book shows wages for the richest fifth of Americans rising by 14.7 percent over the last decade; but wages for those in the poorest fifth have dropped by 3.6 percent. On average, the table shows, wages rose 7.3 percent.

HEADLINE: Tongues New to English, Eyes Fresh to the Capital

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER

 BODY:
America has not been all that she had hoped, but as she got off the bus on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, Ewa Lis, a Polish immigrant, was not disappointed. The building before her was big and white, "exactly as I imagined it," she said.
Smiling, Ms. Lis handed her camera to her friend Joseph Veninger, who is from Czechoslovakia. "Take a picture of me and my White House." 
 Mr. Veninger wanted to go inside, and maybe get a glimpse of "the person who runs this big system," but it was Sunday, and the White House was closed. Still, Mr. Veninger said he was glad just to be in this mythic town that he knew only from books and television.
"This is for me the main office for America," he said.
 
More Than English Lessons
 Monday through Friday, Mr. Veninger and the other 22 immigrants in Donna Harkavy's class in English as a second language meet in a basement in Brooklyn, offered free by the New York City Board of Education. The subject is not just English, but America, and so on Sunday, after earlier trips to New York landmarks like the Statue of Liberty, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Brooklyn Public Library, the class convened in the nation's capital.
It was the culmination of the year and, for all but one or two of them, their first trip to Washington. After the trials of real life in their new home, New York, Washington was a place they had to see, a chance to visit the dream America. "Washington is a mecca for immigrants," Ms. Harkavy said.
The Washington they saw -- in six whirlwind hours, for the bargain price of $21, round trip -- amazed them. It was, they said, so clean, so peaceful, so full of flowers.
 
Another Side of Town
 Maria Charles, from Puerto Rico, tried to tell her classmates that beyond the White House and the Lincoln Memorial was another side of the nation's capital that she had read was as poor and dangerous as the city where they lived.
Sunday in Washington reminded Mr. Veninger of being a newcomer in New York six years ago. "At first you're like a tourist, and you see all the museums and big buildings," he said. "But after a while you see what life really looks like -- the killing, the depression, all the sad things that happen in the big city.
"When I came here, my friend said, 'Joe, in New York you have to have special locks, two, three locks, and gates on your window.' I said, 'What for?' Then they robbed my apartment. They take everything, my cheap TV, my mattress, my clothes, even my shoes. Now I have three locks, two Medeco and one regular. I have big gate on my window."
In New York, Mr. Veninger, who was a mechanic in Czechoslovakia, is unemployed. Ms. Lis, who taught psychology in a Polish university, has a job taking care of an elderly woman.
 
A Rare Day Off
 Hawa Jibral, who seven years ago was tending sheep in Somalia and now stocks shoes in a discount store, got a rare day off. "I'm sick of shoes," Ms. Jibral said, boarding the brown and yellow bus at 6:30 A.M. outside the Brooklyn Public Library. "Every day I'm looking at shoes."
But on this day, Ms. Jibral, in a beautiful gold and green African dress and black patent leather shoes, looked at monuments, memorials, gardens and space shuttles at the National Air and Space Museum. A life-size reproduction of the lunar landing of the Apollo II reminded her, she said, of moonlit nights with her sheep in the Somalian desert.
She and her classmates, who were the subject of several articles in The New York Times during the school year, made the trip with another English class, taught by Ms. Harkavy's friend, as well as with friends and relatives. Sam Barq, from Pakistan, brought his wife, his mother-in-law, his two sisters-in-law, his baby, and homemade, hot Pakistani food for half the bus.
They were 49 in all, from Haiti, Thailand, Mali, Senegal, Russia, Peru, El Salvador, Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic and seven other countries. The motto of these travelers was "Speak English," but when the bus hit Maryland, Ms. Harkavy put out a call for international singing. Ms. Charles stepped to the front of the bus, took the driver's microphone and, in a clear soprano, sang in Spanish about an old man who longs to return to San Juan.
Her father and his classmates were concentrating on their new vocabulary words: memorial, monument, Congress, Senate, House of Representatives, Supreme Court, enshrined (at the Lincoln Memorial "the memory of Abraham Lincoln is enshrined forever"). And goose bumps.
"I have goose bumps," Mr. Veninger said, standing before the black marble wall of names at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial ("I thought goose bumps were just from cold, not emotions," Meyer Sadigurskiy, from Russia, said as the class reviewed the words Tuesday).
On the trip home, these tourists watched a video on the bus that Ms. Nolan had selected just for them -- "Green Card," a movie about a French immigrant who marries a New York woman to get that coveted document. At 10 P.M., as the bus approached Brooklyn under a full moon, Ms. Jibral was wistful.
"I want to get a transfer to Washington," she said.

Where the Rising Sun Just Casts a Long Shadow

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NAHA, Okinawa, May 18

 BODY:
The Japanese Government spared no effort last week in celebrating the 20th anniversary of America's return of Okinawa, which many regard as the high point in Washington's postwar relations with Tokyo.
The Emperor and the Prime Minister greeted Vice President Dan Quayle warmly as both sides tried to rekindle the good will engendered between the onetime enemies by that act 20 years ago. 
 Only one thing was missing: the Okinawans.
With the main ceremony held in Tokyo, 900 miles to the northeast, and their own rocky, windswept islands reduced almost to an afterthought, the Okinawans decided to hold a separate celebration, pungent with very different meanings.
An orchestra of traditional instruments played the prefecture's distinctive music, strains of China evident in the singsong melodies. But it did not once play the Kimigayo, Japan's unofficial anthem. The song is a paean to the Emperor, making it a symbol here of Japan's wartime oppression of Okinawa, when the islanders could be shot for speaking their own dialect.
 
'Used to Being Insulted'
 And while the national flag, the hinomaru, fluttered in its red and white glory all over Tokyo last Friday, it was conspicuously absent here, except for a single rising sun image above the stage. The three flagpoles in front of the convention center sat empty, bathed in the hard light of a breezy subtropical morning full of hope and frustration for the 1.2 million people of Japan's poorest prefecture.
"Maybe it was insulting for them to have the ceremony in Tokyo, but as an Okinawan I'm used to being insulted," said Tatsuhiro Oshiro, one of the island's most respected novelists. "It will make us stronger. We've accumulated a kind of wisdom from our hardships."
Masahide Ota, the prefecture's American-educated Governor, put the issue in more political, but no less plain-spoken terms. "There would have been one ceremony if the national interests were the same as the local interests," he remarked. "Unfortunately, that was not the case."
The history of the more than 60 islands that make up Okinawa is a story of a culture long caught between more powerful, competing powers. It was a kingdom trading actively with Asia for centuries, then stood in the awkward position from 1611 on of being vassal to both China and Japan. The ambiguity was clarified when the islands were forcibly annexed by Japan in 1879, beginning a period of economic exploitation and cultural intolerance.
The Japanese, preaching homogeneity, looked down on the Okinawans and their dialect, while pressing them to assimilate. The religion of the island, a mix of animism and ancestor worship, was influenced by China, as was its music. Okinawa developed a highly esteemed textile industry, using plantain fiber rather than cotton or silk.
 
A Different Viewpoint
 But Okinawa's economy lagged behind the mainland's, largely as a result of policies formulated in Tokyo. In short, the world looked much different from this easygoing, seaside city than it did from Japan's main islands.
That was never more true than in 1972. In Tokyo, the reversion symbolized Japan's rehabilitation from the defeat of World War II and the beginning of a forward-looking era. But it came at a price, which Okinawa paid on Japan's behalf. Japan allowed the United States to keep its military bases here, a keystone in America's cold war strategy in Asia.
Today, three-fourths of the American forces in Japan are on Okinawa, or more than 30,000 soldiers. The bases take up one-fifth of all the land on the main island here.
Okinawan officials acknowledge that the bases have brought economic benefits, since rent is paid on the land and the bases employ about 8,000 local people. At one time they dominated the economy, but now tourism is the leading industry and much of the base land could be developed far more profitably for resorts or other projects.
More important, the military sites are a nettlesome reminder that, as many here put it, the islands are occupied by a foreign power, sanctioned by Tokyo.
 
150,000 Civilians Killed
 American troops took Okinawa in the last campaign of the Pacific war. Nearly a third of the residents, or almost 150,000 people, were killed as the Japanese forces chose to retreat directly through populated areas. Hundreds more were forced to commit suicide by the defeated Japanese. More than 12,000 American troops and 107,000 Japanese were killed.
Many here remember the American occupation as a period of benign neglect. The Okinawans answered ultimately to unelected American occupiers, but faced none of the cultural suppression the Japanese had inflicted on them.
"I'm not going to forgive you for those 27 years of occupation, Mr. Oshiro said. "But it did make it possible for us to develop independently. We had the space to develop our culture and look at Japan in a new way."
Governor Ota said the Okinawans were waging a battle on two related fronts. On the one hand, he said, the bases must be removed. In addition, the Okinawans insist they will fight to retain their special identity amid a culture that demands conformity.
"It's not quite confidence you see here now, but something on the way to being confident," said Hiroko Sho, the prefecture's Vice Governor. "It's just beginning in a more solid way. That's what has started with the 20th anniversary."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Voters;
Indifference and Disgust Are Leading in California

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MILPITAS, Calif., May 19

 BODY:
When The Milpitas Post sent its inquiring photographer into the streets this week, asking "Are you going to vote?" people hemmed and hawed, more reluctant to commit themselves than they had been the week before, when the question was "What's so special about your mom?"
Fifty percent of them finally owned up that they doubted they would go to the polls on June 2, primary day in the nation's most populous state -- a highly unscientific tabulation, but one that the editor of the weekly newspaper, Tom Gilsenan, found noteworthy compared to years past. 
 "There's a feeling of great disgruntlement," he said. "People are annoyed by the whole political process."
 
Mirror of the State
 Dozens of other interviews in this Santa Clara County community this week, at a shopping mall, a Little League game, a senior citizen center and the town's bustling library, revealed that disgruntlement, and then some.
And what voters are thinking in Milpitas is not an idle inquiry, since this ethnically diverse city of 50,686 has traditionally mirrored the voting patterns of the state.
Many of those interviewed said they were regular voters but were not sure they would cast ballots this time, or would do so only reluctantly, because they doubted that either President Bush or Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the likely Democratic nominee, had the gumption to do anything that would alter their lives or the way business was conducted in Washington.
And as for the two Senate races that are simultaneously under way in California, the vast majority of those interviewed did not know who was running, despite the millions of dollars spent on television advertising.
Over and over, the voters in Milpitas (pronounced Mill-PEA-tis) said they were interested in only three things this election season: the possible candidacy of Ross Perot, a local ballot initiative in nearby San Jose about building a stadium for the Giants baseball team, and term limitations that would force incumbents from office.
None of the three is on the June ballot here.
 
'Other Things to Worry About'
 Linda Runswick, a Bush supporter in 1988 who was watching her son in a Little League championship, said the unappealing choices convinced her it was a waste of time to vote. "I have too many other things to worry about," she said.
Mrs. Runswick's husband was laid off from an aerospace job and is struggling to make a living as a freelance consultant. Eight months ago she was "forced" back to work, she said, as a receptionist. Now she is tired and very angry.
"I can't even figure out who's the lesser of two evils," she said of the presidential candidates.
Her son's coach, Tony Himan, agreed, although he planned to vote -- for Bush in the primary, for lack of alternatives, but he hoped to vote for Mr. Perot in the fall.
"The choices between the Republicans and Democrats are not that different lately," said Mr. Himan, a design specialist at the Stanford Linear Accelerator. "It winds up the same no matter who you elect. I haven't heard anybody that even hints at being radical enough to make any changes." Except Mr. Perot, who the coach thought might be the man to tackle "an economy going nowhere" and "racial tension that hasn't diminished and seems to be on the rise."
 
For the Sake of Change
 The enthusiasm for Mr. Perot, who is viewed as an agent of change although nobody seems to know what changes he would make, matches recent polls that show the Texas industrialist beating both President Bush and Mr. Clinton in a three-way race.
Though Mr. Perot is not on the ballot next month, 11 major Senatorial candidates are but hardly anybody here has a clue what their names are.
"Is it Delaine Easton?" asked 86-year-old John McNevin, lunching at the senior center, who suggested a state Assembly member with no announced plans for higher office.
"Is it Pete Wilson?" asked Patricia Ireland, who described herself as an opponent of legal abortion and was quick to point out that she was not related to her namesake, the president of the National Organization for Women.
 
Memory Aids Needed
 In the stands at the Little League game, Liz Skelly, came a bit closer: "Is there -- I don't know if she's running for Senate or another office, but I know there's a woman who bounced checks. Docker? A name that sounds like Docker?"
Might she mean Barbara Boxer, a member of the House of Representatives who is, in fact, running in one of the Democratic primary races? "Yeah, that's it," Mrs. Skelly said. "I knew I was thinking of those shorts for a reason. You know how you associate things."
Those who could name a Senate candidate rarely knew the opponent. Ralph Santoro, who drove a pickup truck covered with local political posters to a senior center, was asked his opinion of Dianne Feinstein, the former mayor of San Francisco, who is running against Gray Davis, the state comptroller, in one Democratic primary.
"McCarthy's going to get it, he'll beat her," Mr. Santoro declared, referring to Leo McCarthy, California's Lieutenant Governor and a candidate in the other Democratic primary for Senate.
Similarly, Calvin R. Burks, an accountant catching up on his work at the library, said he preferred Ms. Feinstein to Representative Boxer. Told the two were running in different races, Mr. Burks looked confused.
Milpitas, which means little cornfield, was first designated a bellwether town at an 1862 political rally in nearby San Jose, when a sign was raised aloft that said "As Milpitas goes, so goes the state."
Since then, the voting here has generally matched the state's, through the years when asparagus and strawberry fields gave way to a Ford Motor Company plant and more recently as high-technology companies moved in and computer professionals replaced auto workers.
As Milpitas evolved from farming to manufacturing and eventually to high technology, the demographics here have changed dramatically, just as they have statewide. The community now has no ethic majority, as the state will not within a few years, according to census projections.
White people represented 63 percent of the population in 1980, they are now 42 percent, while the Asian population has grown from 12 percent to 33 percent. The Hispanic and black populations have remained relatively stable, at 19 percent and 5.5 percent, respectively. The city government continues to be dominated by white office-holders.
Here and statewide, Asian-Americans are slow to vote, some because they are not yet eligible. One of them, Sam Lin, a Taiwanese engineer who is not yet a United States citizen, interrupted his newspaper reading in the library the other day to muse on the mood of his neighbors.
"Everyone is so interested in Magic Johnson or people in Hollywood and not so much in politicians, who would influence their future," he said. "This is very sad to me."

HEADLINE: Dow Falls 15.13, to 3,378.71, As Hopes for Rate Cut Dim

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The stock market staged a broad retreat yesterday, yielding to new doubts about the outlook for further interest-rate cuts.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 15.13 points, to 3,378.71, slipping for a second day after hitting a record high on Tuesday. 
 Declining issues outnumbered advances by almost 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Big Board volume came to 184.9 million shares, against 198.9 million on Wednesday.
The broader New York Stock Exchange index fell 1.47 points, to 227.47; the Standard & Poor's 500 lost 2.79, to 412.60; the Nasdaq composite dropped 1.19, to 579.10, and the American Exchange composite lost 0.52, to 391.63.
 
Looking to the Fed
 The market made its run to new highs Tuesday amid rising expectations of fresh moves soon by the Federal Reserve to relax its credit policy. But the excitement began to die down Wednesday when the Fed seemed to signal that it was not yet ready to make such a move.
The chances of Fed action were apparently reduced further yesterday when the Labor Department reported that initial claims for state unemployment insurance dropped by 20,000 in the week ended May 9, indicating an improving economy.
Interest rates rose in the credit markets on the news of that larger-than-expected decline. Prices of long-term Government bonds fell more than $5 for each $1,000 in face value, increasing their yields to about 7.86 percent.
Among active stocks yesterday, Federated Department Stores, dropped 1/8, to 11 7/8, on turnover of nearly 9 million shares. Underwriters late Wednesday priced an offering of 40 million Federated shares at $11.50 apiece.
General Motors held steady at 39, matching the price of this week's huge offering. Volume in G.M. was down sharply from the nearly 17 million shares that traded on Wednesday, but with 2.8 million traded yesterday, it was still No. 4 on the Big Board active list.
U.S. Shoe tumbled 2 1/8, to 12 5/8. The company reported lower profits for the fiscal quarter ended May 2 and said it expected another earnings decline in the current quarter because of what it described as a "soft retail environment."
Navistar was heavily traded, down 1/4, to 2 7/8. The truck maker posted a loss for its fiscal second quarter and projected a loss for the current quarter as well.
Charming Shoppes, traded in the over-the-counter market, rose 1 5/8, to 29 3/8, on the company's report of higher quarterly earnings.
Amgen, another Nasdaq issue, gained 1 3/4, to 59. Gordon Bordon, the biotechnology company's chief executive, described himself as "comfortable" with analysts' estimates that sales would reach $1 billion this year.
Ben & Jerry's Homemade, the ice cream company, also traded over the counter, added 2 1/2, to 43 3/4, on news of a pending 2-for-1 stock split.
Humana fell 1 3/4, to 21 1/4, on top of a 2 1/4-point loss Wednesday, when the hospital company estimated lower quarterly profits.
The upswing in interest rates hurt mortgage-finance issues. Fannie Mae dropped 1 5/8, to 64, and Federal Home Loan Mortgage fell 1 1/4, to 41 1/4.
Numerous industrial stocks linked to the business cycle also lost ground. Phelps Dodge fell 1 1/2, to 88 1/8; Georgia-Pacific 1 1/4, to 64; International Paper 5/8, to 70 5/8; Dow Chemical 5/8, to 61 7/8, and Alcoa 1/8, to 76 3/4.

Canada's Leader Says Battle For Democracy Is Not Over

 BODY:
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada told graduates at Johns Hopkins University yesterday that "it is rare in history that there has been such a victory for an idea -- the idea of democracy."
"The defeat of Communism opened the door to democracy," Mr. Mulroney said. "But it also brought economic hardship to 425 million people throughout Central and Eastern Europe." 
 Mr. Mulroney added, "The task the world's democrats face now is to secure that victory and to insure that it is neither hollow nor short-lived."
He addressed the 3,758 graduates outdoors on the Keyser Quadrangle on the campus in Baltimore. It was the university's 116th commencement exercises.
At a separate ceremony held in the afternoon for the graduating seniors only, Lee A. Iacocca, chairman of the Chrysler Corporation, spoke to students and received an honorary degree.
Other recipients of honorary degrees were: C. Everett Koop, former Surgeon General of the United States; Michel Rocard, former Prime Minister of France; Abraham Horwitz, an alumnus and director of the Pan American Health Organization; Zanvyl Krieger, a Baltimore lawyer and businessman and alumnus of the university, and Robert M. Heyssel, the retiring president of The Johns Hopkins Hospital and university's health system.
Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, spoke in the afternoon to the graduate students in the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies.
 
Rutgers University
 Francis L. Lawrence, the president of Rutgers University, told 9,675 graduates that "teaching without research is empty" and that "research without teaching is sterile" at the university's 226th commencement, which was held yesterday in New Brunswick, N.J.
Calling research "today's favorite campus bogey" and noting that it is too often seen as an excuse for poor teaching, Dr. Lawrence said that research enriches the teaching process. "Research is the very meat of higher education," he said. "Without it, our table would be bare."
Honorary degrees were awarded to Sir Michael Francis Atiyah, the director of the Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences at Trinity College in England; the chef Julia Child; Dr. Ernest Mario, chief executive of Glaxo Holdings p.l.c., a pharmaceutical company, and Dr. Roger Newland Shepard, a professor of social science at Stanford University.
Although the degrees were formally conferred at yesterday's ceremony, most graduates will receive their diplomas at separate convocations, which are being held until May 31st. Speakers at the convocations will include Thomas Pickering, the United States Ambassador to the United Nations, and Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey.
 
Stevens Institute
 "Don't wish for change -- change things," Gov. Jim Florio of New Jersey told 729 graduates yesterday at the Stevens Institute of Technology's 120th commencement ceremony, held on the college's campus in Hoboken.
Honorary doctor of engineering degrees were conferred on Governor Florio; Robert E. Allen, the chairman of A.T.&T., and Dr. Kathryn D. Sullivan, an astronaut who has been on three space shuttle missions.
 
Bank Street College
 Bank Street College of Education awarded 190 master's degrees yesterday at its 41st commencement ceremony, in the Synod House at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine. It was the school's largest class of graduates.

HEADLINE: White House Is Ready for a Rosier Outlook

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 21

 BODY:
President Bush's chief economist said today that because of recent signs of an economic pickup, the White House would soon raise its forecast for economic growth for this year.
Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, said that lower interest rates and increases in business and consumer confidence were among the reasons that the Administration would revise upward the growth forecast of 2.2 percent it made in January. 
 The Council of Economic Advisers is required to issue a new, midyear growth forecast each July, and some economists suggested that in tipping its hand now, the Administration was seeking to build momentum for President Bush in the California primary on June 2.
But others said that Mr. Boskin, who prides himself on his professionalism, was merely revising the Administration's forecast upward the way many private sector economists have.
After noting that the nation's economy had endured a long slowdown, Mr. Boskin said, "It's now resumed a pattern of more robust growth."
In a speech today in Washington, Mr. Boskin declined to specify by how much the Administration would increase its forecast, saying the new forecast would be announced in June or July.
Mr. Boskin said there were still several reasons that have kept the recovery from being stronger, noting that cuts in military spending were causing layoffs. He added, "We still seem to have problems in the growth of money" supply and in the availability of credit in certain regions and industries.
Speaking at the same Washington conference, which was sponsored by the United States Export-Import Bank, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady urged the Federal Reserve to do more to ease credit. "We believe there is room for a further easing of monetary policies" to "promote growth," he said.
The Federal Reserve Open Market Committee, the principal group setting monetary policy, met behind closed doors on Tuesday, with many analysts predicting that it would decide against lowering rates soon because the economy was gathering steam. The Wall Street Journal reported today that the central bank had decided on Tuesday against any immediate cut in short-term rates.
Federal Reserve officials declined to comment on that report.
 
Equally Balanced
 Last week, Lawrence Lindsay, a Federal Reserve governor, pointed to no change in rates when he said the risks the American economy faced were equally balanced on the upside and downside. He said on the one hand there was the risk that excessive growth would spur inflation, while on the other side there were dangers of economic weakness.
Businesses and economists have frequently taken a skeptical approach to the Administration forecasts because, particularly in the first term of the Reagan Administration, the predictions were overly optimistic for political reasons. Mr. Boskin's forecasts have been more realistic than those of many of his predecessors.
The Blue Chip Economic Indicators, a survey of leading economists, forecasts that the nation's economy will grow at a 2.8 percent rate from December 1991 to December 1992. That is up from the 2.4 percent forecast the group made in January.
Responding to Mr. Boskin's remarks, Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland and chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, said, "Even if they have some revision upward, it is still pretty poor growth trying to move out of recession. The average growth rate in the first year of other post-war recoveries was about 6 percent."
Mr. Sarbanes said that growth was so slow that most economists were predicting that unemployment would remain above 7 percent at the end of this year.
 
'Substantially' Upward
 Mr. Boskin predicted today that when the Commerce Department revises its preliminary 2 percent growth estimate for first quarter, it would revise the figure "substantially" upward.
"The economy continues to grow in the second quarter," Mr. Boskin said, "and there are a number of favorable signs." He added that inflation was on a downward course and that "the export sector has been a tremendous source of strength." He noted that banks, which he said were not yet an engine of commercial lending to sustain the recovery, had increased their capital ratios and were seeing their stock prices rise.
David Wyss, director of research for DRI-McGraw Hill, an economics consulting firm in Lexington, Mass., said his firm had revised its forecasts upward for 1992 principally because of strong-than-anticipated growth in the first quarter and a surprising burst in consumer spending. In the first quarter, consumer spending rose by 5.3 percent, propelled in part by higher consumer confidence.
In January, DRI-McGraw Hill was forecasting 2.6 percent growth for all of 1992, but its latest forecast calls for 3.1 percent growth.
"It's on the good side or normal. It's not a boom," he said. Then, speaking about the timing of Mr. Boskin's remarks, more than a month before the official midyear report, he added, "This is fairly typical if they're going to have pleasant revision. You expect them to telegraph it a bit."
Lyle Gramley, a former governor of the Federal Reserve who is chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, predicts the nation's economy will grow by 2.5 percent this year, while early this year he was predicting annual growth of 2 percent. He noted that early this year many economists were predicting a flat or down first quarter, but he said strong housing starts and consumer spending produced a surprisingly strong quarter.
"Sometimes Administration forecasts have what I call an element of political optimism," he said. "You stretch as much as you can without straining the bounds of credibility."
But he said that, if anything, the council's forecasts under Mr. Boskin have been conservative. "I would not be inclined to put any political interpretation" on Mr. Boskin's remarks, he said, suggesting that the Administration had revised its estimates upward the way so many other economists had.

Japan Sees Chip Pact as Success; U.S. Disagrees

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
Japanese semiconductor makers said yesterday that as part of a semicondutor trade agreement with the United States, Japan had significantly improved foreign companies' access to the home market of the world's largest chip makers.
But American chip producers and industry analysts responded that the Japanese were simply trying to put the best face on troubled high-tech trade relations between the United States and Japan. 
 The market assessment by the Japanese came in a study produced in response to a document by the United States Semiconductor Industry Association. The American report, issued in March, had said bluntly that the 1991 U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Arrangement was not working.
 
Prelude to Japan Tour
 Both sides are jockeying for position as American chip makers prepare to visit Japan next month for consultations with Japanese Government and industry officials. Some American semiconductor executives have been arguing that the trade agreement has failed and that the United States Government should issue sanctions against Japanese chipmakers because Japan has not opened its markets sufficiently.
But yesterday the Japanese report said that steady progress had been made since 1986, when a precursor to the 1991 semiconductor agreement was signed, and that more progress would have been made if the recession had not blunted sales.
"The steady rise in joint ventures and other cooperative arrangements between United States and Japanese chip manufacturers is strong and tangible evidence of success in improving market access," Iwao Ojima, president of the Electronic Industry Association of Japan, said in a prepared statement.
The American view is radically different.In its March report the S.I.A. said that increased access to Japanese markets had essentially stagnated since the first quarter of 1990.
"They have been putting out this misinformation for two years," said Andrew Procassini, president of the S.I.A. "It is appalling that the first or second economy in the world is acting like a bunch of penny pinchers."
Both sides agree that the American share of the Japanese market increased from 8.5 percent in 1985 to 12.5 percent in 1991.
At issue is whether a provision -- contained in both the 1986 and the 1991 agreeements -- to raise the Americans' share to 20 percent was a commitment or merely a goal.
The crucial language of the 1991 agreement reads, "The Government of Japan recognizes that the U.S. semiconductor industry expects that the foreign market share will grow to more than 20 percent of the Japanese market by the end of 1992 and considers that this can be realized."
The report released yesterday by the Japanese says, "The 1991 arrangement was not a guarantee of market share, but a commitment to market access."
 
Interpretation Is Disputed
 United States semiconductor industry executives and Government officials dispute this interpretation. "The bottom line is that we came to an agreement," said William J. Spencer, head of the Sematech, the United States industry-government chip-making consortium.
The Japanese report based its conclusion that the situation had improved significantly on what it called the increase in joint ventures between Japanese and United States chip makers and a growing number of "design-ins" -- American-Japanese corporate relationships that involve United States chip makers in the earliest stages of developing new Japanese electronic systems.

HEADLINE: April Budget Surplus Off

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 21

 BODY:
Tax collections weakened by the recession helped shrink the Government's budget surplus for April to less than half of last year's level, the Treasury Department said today.
The surplus was $14.6 billion last month, reducing the deficit for the first seven months of the fiscal year to $184.7 billion. But the April budget balance a year ago was $30 billion, swelled by a $5 billion contribution from America's allies in the gulf war. 
 The deficit-to-date this year is 51 percent greater than last year's comparable $122.2 billion. That puts the deficit on track to break last year's record $269.5 billion.
April tax receipts from individuals totaled $68 billion after deducting refunds, down from $77.8 billion last year.
The Bush Administration projected a $399.7 billion deficit, but many economists expect a shortfall of around $330 billion, with much of the improvement attributed to a delay in the savings and loan bailout.

More Sunday Papers Deliver Shampoo as Well as News

BYLINE: By Eben Shapiro

 BODY:
AN intriguing new idea in newspaper advertising began with a friendly backyard chat between neighbors in Cincinnati.
Cincinnati is home to the nation's largest advertiser, the Procter & Gamble Company, and one neighbor was Kevin Hall, the brand manager for P.&G.'s Vidal Sassoon shampoo. Mr. Hall was musing about the company's growing interest in door-to-door sampling and the difficulty of finding an effective distribution system.
The other participant at the patio meeting was the production chief for The Cincinnati Enquirer, providing Mr. Hall with an idea. "Wait a second," he recalls saying. "The paper goes door to door."
A few weeks later, when The Enquirer's 250,000 Sunday subscribers padded out to retrieve their papers, each one contained a one-ounce sample of Vidal Sassoon shampoo.
In their endless quest to get samples of their products into the hands, hair and mouths of consumers, packaged-goods giants are showing growing interest in using the distribution strength of newspapers.
Since the Sassoon test in Cincinnati last May, many Sunday newspapers subscribers have essentially received a free breakfast, courtesy of similar promotions. Kellogg has used newspapers to send out six million samples of a new cereal, and Maxwell House has delivered small packets of coffee.
Last weekend, using a network of newspapers across the country, P.&G. delivered 18 million small bottles of its Pantene SP shampoo.
Still, the programs are viewed largely as tests, and several marketing executives said that once the novelty wore off, the idea might seem less compelling.
But for now advertisers are looking closely at the approach. "They are wonderful distribution alternatives," said Rick Hosfield, director of media, broadcast and shows for General Mills, which is reportedly studying the use of newspapers for sending out samples.
Mr. Hosfield said the combination of a sample, coupon and full-page advertisements was a potent method to sell packaged goods. "Newspapers have become a multifaceted marketing tool," he said.
Mr. Hosfield and other marketing executives said newspapers were overdue in developing new ways to attract advertisers. "They've been very difficult to do business with," said Mr. Hosfield, who overseas all advertising spending for General Mills. As a result, he said, "They are a terrific resource that has been under-utilized."
The innovation was born of one of the worst recessions in decades for the newspaper industry. Publishers are desperately trying to find new ways to accommodate advertisers and make money.
"Adversity breeds changes," said Marcella Rosen, a managing director of the N. W. Ayer ad agency. Ms. Rosen said the sampling programs were a good idea. "The distribution system is an untapped resource."
Newspapers have good reason to become attuned to the needs of the food and soap companies. They are huge advertisers. P.&G. spent $2.28 billion on advertising in 1990, according to Advertising Age, with network television accounting for by far the largest share. While the food companies use Sunday newspapers heavily to distribute coupons, they do little other newspaper advertising.
Newspapers are using the interest in sampling to sell more ads. As part of a sampling promotion, a packaged-goods company buys a page and a half of advertising. Also included is an advertisement for the product, which would be in the plastic bag covering the Sunday paper. Such promotions cost about 20 cents a sample, including the advertising and plastic bag. That price is similar to the cost of mailing a sample, the conventional way of distributing samples.
Last year, The Chicago Tribune developed a product sampling program called Newspac that allows samples to be inserted automatically into Sunday papers along with coupons.
Mr. Hall of Procter & Gamble said the chief benefit of using newspapers instead of mail for sampling was that all the samples would arrive on the same day. That allows marketers to run advertisements in conjunction with the samples, and it lets retailers stock up on the product.
Mr. Hall said the most successful products for such sampling promotions were those used in a morning routine, like shampoo or soap.
A network, the National Four-Color Newspaper Network, exists that allows consumer-goods companies to distribute samples in 28 million newspapers at once. The sampling programs are still in their infancy. The network has been involved in seven programs so far and is planning several more.

HEADLINE: Claims for Jobless Benefits Drop

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 21

 BODY:
New applications for state unemployment benefits fell 20,000 in the week ended May 9, the Labor Department said today in a report showing a stronger job market than economists had expected.
It said first-time jobless claims numbered 406,000 in the period, down from a revised 426,000 a week earlier. The department had previously reported 424,000 new claims for the week ended May 2. 
 The four-week moving average number of new applications, viewed by economists as a more accurate barometer of the job market than the weekly figure, was 412,500, up slightly from 412,000.
Analysts said the report showed the economic recovery was gaining strength and provided another reason for the Federal Reserve not to ease interest rates further.
"I am somewhat more optimistic," said David Jones, chief economist with Aubrey G. Lanston & Company. "I think the recovery is here to stay. The odds are way down for a further Fed easing."
California reported the largest weekly gain, with 12,013 people filing for first-time unemployment benefits. During the previous week, 13 state unemployment offices had been closed for two days because of the Los Angeles riots.
California attributed the increase to the start of a new quarter of wage credits for benefit purposes; the riots, which resulted in about 3,900 claims, and layoffs in the construction and trade industries.
Ohio reported the second-largest gain, with 3,562 new claims, followed by Georgia, with 1,196.
North Carolina, which reported 4,814 fewer claims, said there were fewer layoffs in the construction and furniture industries.
New York reported a drop of 2,870 claims. It said there were fewer service-industry layoffs.
The total number of new claims was the lowest since the week of April 18, when there were 404,000 claims filed.

Then There Were 3? Don't Bet on It

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
It's war up there.
The bloodiest battle for mastery of the skies may be at hand. Many industry experts say the steep cut in fares that American Airlines initiated last month could bury three competitors operating under the protection of the bankruptcy courts: Trans World Airlines, Continental and America West. And the cuts could mortally wound two others, USAir and Northwest, that are struggling to stay ahead of their creditors. 
 For his part, Robert Crandall, American Airlines' chairman, says that the industry's only real problem is that too many carriers are chasing too few passengers.
Is Mr. Crandall correct? Could the Darwinian struggle for the air traveler's dollar ultimately leave just three behemoths -- American, United and Delta -- to serve the national market?
Market-minded economists, who would have scoffed just a few years ago, are scoffing no more. They now concede that further consolidation is in the cards. But this does not mean that the economics of air travel dictates some small, magic number of survivors. Indeed, many contend that a blind faith in the advantages of large size has been the undoing of some of the giants of yesteryear.
But most important, they are cautiously optimistic that the spectacular progess in reducing the average fare and providing far more frequent service -- improvements that airline deregulation has brought consumers -- will not be lost in the consolidation. And while these experts are not looking forward to testing the proposition, many now believe that three to five national carriers, plus a few low-cost regional airlines, could provide all the competition needed to preserve the fruits of deregulation.
Thus while experts want the overextended airlines to get the best possible shot at survival, few are calling for heroic measures. "Market engineering," said Severin Borenstein of the University of California at Davis, "is not the way to go."
Hardly anyone expected that free markets would favor the established giants, with their featherbedding unions and regulation-as-usual mentality, over lean and hungry upstarts. Certainly not the establishment itself: among the big carriers, only United threw its weight behind deregulation in 1978.
But then, hardly anyone at that time understood the economic advantages of large route systems linking cities through hub airports. It takes 10 planes to provide nonstop service simultaneously on 10 routes, notes Alfred Kahn, who, as the airlines' chief Federal regulator in the 1970's, led the fight for deregulation. But the same 10 planes in the air, he points out, can serve 70 routes by shuffling all passengers through a central hub.
Most travelers, as well as big airlines, have been winners from the rush to hub-and-spoke systems. Before deregulation, for example, there was only enough traffic between Oklahoma City and Dallas to support a few flights a day. Now it pays the industry to run 18 flights each way, because both American and Delta use the link to provide one-stop service from Oklahoma City, through Dallas, to dozens of cities.
If economists were surprised by these "economies of scope," they were truly flummoxed by the success of marketing strategies, pioneered by American Airlines, to take maximum advantage of size. First on the list is frequent-flier benefits aimed at business travelers -- what Mr. Borenstein coolly terms "kickbacks to the purchasing agents." They reward loyalty to an airline that serves thousands of routes because it pays to accumulate mileage in a single program.
Then there are the industrywide computerized reservation systems, installed in travel agencies by the big carriers. Washington cracked down on the practice of listing the flights of the system's owner-airline ahead of the competition. But American and United, with the leading reservation networks, can still get a leg up legally by charging competitors an arm and a leg for booking services.
 
Size Isn't Everything
 Advantages achieved through size explain why the airline industry is far more concentrated than, say, the business of growing soybeans. But in the view of Clifford Winston, an economist at the Brookings Institution, they do not fully explain why so many carriers have bitten the dust in the last few years.
Size alone, Mr. Winston notes, did not save Eastern and Pan Am; nor did size spare Continental from bankruptcy court. The decisive factor in virtually every failure, Mr. Winston argues, has been the inability to aim at a lucrative market or to control costs in a business that operates on razor-thin margins.
Mr. Borenstein agrees. Size, he says, cannot explain how small fry like America West and Midway managed to operate at far lower costs per passenger mile than giants like Delta and USAir. Perhaps most disconcerting to those who like simple tales with simple morals, size does not explain why little Southwest, which Kevin Murphy of Morgan Stanley admiringly calls the "snapping turtle" of the industry, has the lowest costs and highest rate of profitability in the industry.
 
Each Failure Is Different
 Explanations for failure seem unique to individual carriers. Pan Am, for example, never found a way to feed domestic passengers into its lucrative foreign routes. Continental never lived down a reputation for wretched service after its ill-considered mergers with Frontier and People Express. And America West made the lethal error of taking on Southwest.
"There are species in which struggles to the death occur in the litter," commented Michael Levine, the dean of Yale's School of Organization and Management.
What all the battered carriers shared, Mr. Winston notes, was a penchant for growing too big, too fast. Headlong growth made sense to airline executives convinced that economies of scale would prove decisive. But the lemming-like rush virtually guaranteed that the industry as a whole would be unable to fill its planes at fares that generated profts.
"When the country lost 9 percent of capacity last year" in bankruptcy liquidations, Kevin Murphy points out, "nobody gave a hoot" because there were still plenty of seats to go around.
To Mr. Levine, who earned his spurs as president of New York Air, which is now defunct, overcapacity guarantees further consolidation. But he says it is far from inevitable that a market-driven consolidation would leave just three major carriers. Much, he suggests, depends on whether the the three big carriers can "force endgame before the end of the recession."
The case of Southwest particularly intrigues Mr. Levine because it is evidence that a well-managed airlines can still succeed by casting itself in a fresh mold. Southwest, he notes, is too small to benefit from a full-court marketing press. It does not restrict flights to an efficient hub-and-spoke system. And it does not even exploit its outsider status and Sun Belt location by paying nonunion wages.
What it manages to do very well, though, is to provide frequent, no-frills service on busy routes at rock-bottom prices. And while Southwest has benefited from the special advantage of a virtual monopoly at Dallas's close-in Love Field, Mr. Levine is optimistic that other low-cost carriers could find other niches outside the path of a predator.
 
Adequate Competition Is Seen
 A few years ago Mr. Levine and other economists who were upset with the mergers that swept away Western, Republic, People Express, Piedmont, PSA, AirCal and Ozark in the late 1980's had long wish lists of policy fixes to buttress competition. Many still favor changes, ranging from divestiture of computer reservation services to an easing of restrictions on foreign ownership of domestic carriers. But they largely agree with Daniel Kasper, a consultant at Harbridge House in Boston, that the benefits conferred on the Big Three are "water over the dam."
If most experts are more sanguine about the industry's drift toward concentration than one might expect, it is because they believe competition among relatively few airlines may be adequate to keep prices in line with costs.
Instead of looking at traditional measures of industry concentration, Clifford Winston and Steven Morrison of Northeastern University asked how many practical alternatives there were for flying from point A to point B. In their forthcoming book, "The Evolution of the Airline Industry" (Brookings), the two economists distill this route-by-route comparison into an index of "effective competition."
The index rose steadily from 1978, the year airlines were deregulated, through 1986. It has since retreated a bit, but remains as high as it was in 1984.
 
Travelers Have Choices
 Why is less more -- or at least not much less? The hub-and-spoke systems that have played a role in dooming less agile carriers have also given most travelers who live outside hub cities the option of making a one-stop trips through a choice of several hubs.
Take the route between two nonhubs, Kansas City, Mo., and San Francisco. Only USAir flies nonstop. But travelers can also make the trip through Denver on United or Continental, through Phoenix on America West, through Dallas on American, through Minneapolis on Northwest, or through Salt Lake City on Delta.
There are some routes -- especially short routes from hubs to nonhub cities -- where prices do seem out of line. A 1990 report by the United States General Accounting Office found that the average fare per passenger mile on flights originating in hub airports was 27 percent higher than fares on flights from other major airports.
And a new study by Mr. Kahn and Gary Dorman, his colleague at Cornell, suggests this "hub premium" is likely to rise as single carriers muscle their way to monopoly positions at the remaining airports that now serve as hubs for two carriers -- notably, Chicago, Denver and Dallas.
But when Mr. Winston and Mr. Morrison adjusted fares for factors ranging from average trip length to the proportion of business travelers using the routes, the hub premium attributable to monopoly power fell to just 5 percent.
It is worth noting, too, that the fare tribulations of travelers from hub cities are apparently small change compared with gains to other travelers. Adjusting for inflation, Mr. Winston and Mr. Morrison calculate that average fares were 20 percent lower in 1991 than the airlines would have been allowed to charge before deregulation.
 
A Lurking Fear
 If there is a horror scenario lurking, it is one in which the big three airlines dominate all important routes and manage to grow their way out of overcapacity. Then they might allow their costs to rise and service to deteriorate, much the way Detroit auto makers got fat and sloppy for lack of competition in the 1950's and 1960's.
But that scenario depends on the willingness of each of the giants to settle for a stable share of the market -- a tendency none of the three has exhibited in the last decade. It also depends on the reluctance of newcomers to leap at the prospect of skimming the cream from established carriers' less competitive routes.
Mr. Murphy, for one, finds such reluctance very unlikely, provided new airlines have access to airport gates and rights to use congested airports. "You will always have new entry," he said. "Airlines are a glamour business, like the movie business."

Dollar Ends Mostly Higher; Gold Prices Decline to $337

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar ended mostly higher in technically driven, light trading yesterday.
Gold prices fell. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery was $337 an ounce, down from $338 on Wednesday. Later, the Republic National Bank also quoted gold at $337, off 50 cents an ounce. 
 A dollar rally amid moderate morning trading ran out of steam in the afternoon ahead of the long Memorial Day weekend, said Ken Boyer, a market analyst with MMS International.
Traders said that indicated the rise had been more a technical correction than a shift in the market sentiment toward the dollar. On Wednesday, the dollar reversed its downward spiral of the last few sessions.
Mr. Boyer said the morning rise was prompted in part by an article in The Wall Street Journal that said the Federal Reserve's policy makers had decided against an immediate cut in short-term interest rates.
Such a move would help the dollar, since lower interest rates make dollar-denominated securities less valuable to investors.
The article prompted short-covering in a market that had heavily oversold the dollar expecting the Fed might tinker with rates to shore up the faltering economy.
Mr. Boyer said that other than speculation about whether or not the Fed would change its monetary policy, there was not much news moving the market.
In New York, the dollar closed at 130.35 Japanese yen, up from 129.50 Wednesday. In Tokyo, the dollar rose to 129.61 yen, from 129.22 at Wednesday's close. In London, it rose to 130.25 yen.
The British pound in New York was quoted at $1.8165, down from $1.8310 late Wednesday. In London, sterling fell to $1.8170, from $1.8300 Wednesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday, were: 1.6155 German marks, up from 1.6010; 1.4850 Swiss Francs, up from 1.4700; 5.4360 French francs, up from 5.3865; 1,218.00 Italian lire, up from 1,205.00, and 1.19745 Canadian dollars, up from 1.19445.

Is There Really A Business Cycle?

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
WHERE are we in the business cycle? Stock prices have soared to a high on expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again. Bond prices have surged, reportedly on flight-to-safety buying and, contradictorily, on the belief that inflationary fears are unwarranted.
But housing starts plunged 17 percent in April, the biggest decline in eight years, after three months of sharp gains. The dollar slid to a three-month low against the German mark. Japanese stock prices and land prices plummeted. Olympia & York, the world's biggest real estate corporation, filed for bankruptcy. Alexander's, the retail chain, went bust. R. H. Macy & Company, operating under the bankruptcy law, said it would close eight department stores, including four in the New York region. Economists, on average, grew more optimistic, but economists are a lagging indicator. Business sentiment improved. Consumer sentiment zigged and zagged. 
 Is there really such a thing as a business cycle, in the sense of regular waves of expansion and contraction -- or are there just random walks around long-term trends?
In a 593-page tome, "Business Cycles: Theory, History, Indicators, and Forecasting," Victor Zarnowitz of the National Bureau of Economic Research comes closer to belief in the existence of the business cycle than to agnosticism. The evidence, he says, shows "a persistence of sequential relationships and interactions among time series representing a wide range of economic, financial or other variables."
The National Bureau view is that business upswings and downswings are endogenous, that is, built into the capitalist system, rather than exogenous, the result of random shocks coming from outside the system. But shocks like wars or oil embargoes can break or prolong a business cycle.
The National Bureau's conclusion stops short of suggesting that all business fluctuations will have similar durations or amplitudes. The average United States business cycle has lasted about four years, plus or minus one year, but there have been big deviations from that average. While the average duration of four mild recessions between 1920 and 1982 was only 10 months, the Great Depression of 1929-33 lasted 43 months.
So, too, for expansions: While the average duration of seven American cyclical expansions from 1949 to 1982 was 46 months, the shortest expansion during that period lasted only 12 months and the longest lasted 106 months. The life of a boom or a bust can't be predicted by its age.
Economists have propounded a wide variety of theories to explain the business cycle, including underconsumption and overinvestment, imbalances between intended saving and intended investment, unstable flows of money and credit, bursts of innovation and contests by imitators, and false expectations of profit, generating careless investment and then slumps. Every theory fingers its own villains: politicians who overspend or undertax, or underspend and overtax; central bankers who increase the money supply too much or not enough; commercial bankers who lend wildly in the boom and crunch credit in the bust; corporations that overborrow and default on their loans, and consumers who do the same.
Every theory also generates forecasts. But how good are they? Theories that rely on a single interaction (as between rising consumption and investment) or a single type of shock (such as a burst in the supply of money or new technology) are, Mr. Zarnowitz says, "attractively simple and can be instructive," but, on the whole, fare poorly when they are confronted with data, because such models are seriously incomplete.
Similarly, a computer scientist, Prof. Lofti A. Zadeh of the University of California at Berkeley, maintains that conventional quantitative methods of analysis are of limited use with societal systems, such as the national or world economy, because such systems are "much too complex and too ill defined."
Another approach to economic forecasting is the one used by the National Bureau of Economic Research, in which cyclical regularities are sought out by detailed, empirical analysis of past data. Mr. Zarnowitz contends that such forecasting is improving, though he concedes that it is still weak at turning points in the business cycle.
Still another approach to economic forecasting is to pay less attention to historical data and more to the human actors and institutions whose deeds will determine future data and outcomes.
As for economic policy making, since it has been so undependable in curing the short-term business cycle of its instability, it might be better to focus on doing sensible things for the long run, such as raising the rate of saving and investment to increase long-term growth, putting more money into research and development, prime sources of innovation, and improving education and skills.

Prices for Cocoa Plummet To Lowest Level in 19 Years

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

DATELINE: CHICAGO, May 21

 BODY:
Continued selling of cocoa by producers in the Ivory Coast drove the price of cocoa to its lowest point since 1973.
Cocoa for delivery in July settled at $881 a ton, down $30, after setting a new life-of-contract low at $879 on the New York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange.
The Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa producer, is selling roughly 30,000 tons of cocoa a week, analysts said. As of last Friday, producers in the Ivory Coast had sold 310,000 to 350,000 tons of its crop for 1992-93; they will need to sell at least 250,000 more tons by Oct. 1 to fulfill their agreement with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, analysts said. There was little buying interest by commercial investors. 
 "Cocoa inventories in the U.S. and Europe are bloated," said Jean Sundrla, an analyst with Evans Economics in Washington. Until the supply situation changes, cocoa prices are likely to fall further, she added.
 
Gains for Energy
 At the New York Mercantile Exchange, prices of energy futures settled higher amid perceptions that Saudi Arabia would not press for an increase in the production ceiling of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, as many had expected.
Light sweet crude oil for delivery in July closed 50 cents higher at $20.90 a barrel. June heating oil settled at 56.10 cents a gallon, up 0.9 cent, and June unleaded gasoline settled at 63.20 cents a gallon, up 0.93 cent.
At the Chicago Board of Trade, the price of soybeans and grain for delivery in July plunged because of forecasts of rain and cooler temperatures over much of the Midwest, analysts said.
Soybeans for delivery in July led the decline, shedding 15 1/4 cents, to $5.93 3/4 a bushel. Soybeans, which are just being planted, badly need rain to get the crop under way.
Grain futures also sank in reaction to the forecasts. Wheat for delivery in July fell 1 1/2 cents, to $3.40 a bushel, the lowest price since early January. Corn for delivery in July dropped 2 3/4 cents, to $2.52 1/4 a bushel. Oats for delivery in July fell 4 1/4 cents, to $1.30 a bushel.
Washington's grain and soymeal allocation for Russia, which was announced by the Agriculture Department late on Wednesday, was somewhat disappointing, said Pat O'Connell, a grain analyst with Refco in Chicago. The amount of soy products the Russians will buy with American credit guarantees was less than expected, which weighed further on the soybean market. But Mr. O'Connell said the amount of corn and wheat was close to industry expectations.

Cowboy Revue in the Sky At Rainbow and Stars

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
Rainbow and Stars, the elegant cabaret adjacent to the Rainbow Room atop Rockefeller Center, is not the sort of place where one might expect to find three cowboys swapping songs and stories as though they were sharing a campfire in the Arizona wilderness.
But in a striking change of pace from its typical fare, the club is playing host to "Cowboy Logic," an informal revue of songs and poems dealing with western lore. In a show that changes nightly, the veteran country-pop singer Michael Martin Murphey; Don Edwards, a Texan troubadour and archivist of western music, and Waddie Mitchell, a cowboy poet from Elko, Nev., perform round-robin style, trading songs, verses and yarns, accompanied by a trio playing fiddle, bass and keyboard. 
 "What we do is very improvisational," said Mr. Murphey recently. "We just try to feel it. It may seem rambling, but every night it tends to take some kind of form. One night the theme might be death, another night family problems, and another night the lonesome individual confronting himself."
 
The Cowboys' Roots
 Mr. Murphey, who is the show's unofficial leader, is the best known of the three. A pioneer of the progressive-country movement of the early 1970's, he grew up in a rural suburb of Dallas and has released 19 albums over two decades. In 1975, he had a top-five hit with his song "Wildfire."
Mr. Edwards, who lives in Weatherford, Tex., has been a professional cowboy balladeer since 1960. Among his influences, he cites Marty Robbins, Tex Ritter and Rex Allen. His earliest hero is Nathan Howard, a cowboy who under the name Jack Thorp collected and printed one of the first books of cowboy songs in 1908. Mr. Edwards's repertory includes such classics as "Cattle Call," "The Strawberry Roan" and "The Cowboy's Lament" (which is better known as "The Streets of Laredo").
Of the three, Mr. Mitchell is the most dyed-in-the-wool cowboy.
"I grew up on a ranch that was 60 miles from the nearest town and 40 miles from the nearest neighbor, and 33 of those miles were dirt road," he recalled. "We had no electricity. It was one of those situations where we had to entertain each other."
Mr. Mitchell said that he has written more than a thousand poems and has had two books published. He made his public performing debut eight years ago at the first Elko Cowboy Poetry Gathering, an event he helped to organize. He has since appeared a number of times on the "Tonight" show.
 
Finding Kindred Spirits
 It was at the 1986 gathering -- the first such event he had attended -- that Mr. Murphey met his partners in "Cowboy Logic" and had what he described as "a religious experience."
"I'd been collecting cowboy music and performing it among my friends," he recalled. "But when I saw a lot of other guys like me and also women performing this music and enjoying each other's company, it was the most important thing that had happened to me in years in my musical life."
The singer, who was signed in 1985 to the country-music division of Warner Brothers Records, subsequently approached Jim Ed Norman, who runs the label's Nashville operation, with the idea of putting out an album of cowboy songs.
"Because it had been 25 years since Marty Robbins had put out a western album, they didn't think western could be re-introduced," he recalled. "I said I'd like to take you out West so you can see there's a revival going on."
 
And There's the Proof
 Mr. Murphey invited Warner Brothers executives to visit Westfest, an annual outdoor festival of western music and poetry in Copper Mountain, Colo., that he helped organize. They were impressed enough by the enthusiasm of the 40,000 attendees to allow Mr. Murphey to make his album "Cowboy Songs," which was released in 1989. The record surprised everyone except Mr. Murphey by selling 350,000 copies, the most of any of Mr. Murphey's 7 Warner albums, without the benefit of a hit single. Although the record includes original material, its core is devoted to western standards like "Red River Valley," "Home on the Range" and the Roy Rogers-Dale Evans theme song, "Happy Trails to You."
"Cowboy Songs" was so successful that it has inspired the formation of Warner Western, a new label devoted to western and American Indian music and to cowboy poetry. Warner Western had its official debut last week with albums by Mr. Edwards, by Mr. Mitchell and by a western trio, the Sons of the San Joaquin. All three records were produced by Mr. Murphey.
If the label prospers, he hopes to put out talking books of Elmer Kelton, a revered writer from San Angelo, Tex., whose novel, "The Time It Never Rained," is regarded as a regional classic.
 
Protecting the Tradition
 Since teaming up five years, Mr. Murphey, Mr. Edwards and Mr. Mitchell have performed "Cowboy Logic" everywhere from folk clubs and honky-tonk bars to Las Vegas casinos.
"Bringing it to New York has a little bit of an ambassadorial and political agenda," Mr. Murphey said. "Right now, I think a lot of ranchers and farmers are suffering because people don't understand their function in society. I want to make people take a second look at the agrarian tradition of this country and the culture it has produced. The basis of all economy is growing things and producing food. Without an agricultural tradition that is respected, a country dies."
"Cowboy Logic" plays at Rainbow and Stars, 30 Rockefeller Plaza, through June 6. Shows this weekend are at 9 and 11:15 tonight and tomorrow with an a la carte dinner served from 7 P.M. and supper served from 10:15. There is a $35 cover charge with no minimum. Reservations: (212) 632-5000.

HEADLINE: Rescued -- Before They Drop Out

 BODY:
Finally, there's some consistent good news about New York City school dropouts. For the second year in a row, the rate has declined; it's now down to 17 percent -- a dramatic drop from the early 1980's, when the rate reached 42 percent.
The change may be partly due to New York's faltering economy as students stay in school because there are no jobs. A surer reason is Schools Chancellor Joseph Fernandez and his initiatives to rescue students before they disappear. These efforts deserve more state and city financial help than Mr. Fernandez is now getting. 
 It has never been easy to pinpoint precisely how many students dropped out of New York schools. But since 1986 the Board of Education has tracked through graduation the entire cohort of students who enter ninth grade each year, insuring a more accurate calculation. Numbers aside, the board's efforts to keep students in school have not been uniformly successful. The board was criticized for spreading too thin money it got from a state-financed dropout prevention program.
Two years ago Mr. Fernandez redesigned the program, concentrating on at-risk students in 32 selected schools. Under Project Achieve! participating schools created a more supportive environment by providing students with individualized programs and better instructional and support services. The program also sought deeper involvement by community organizations and parents.
The approach appears to be paying off. For the class of 1991 -- students who entered ninth grade in September 1987 -- the dropout rate was 17.2 percent. That's the lowest rate since the new calculations began in 1986.
The dropout progress vindicates Mr. Fernandez's philosophy of early intervention: Identify problem students in lower grades and give them intensive help. Fewer of these students have had to be referred to special education classes, where they would likely remain for years at roughly twice the cost of regular classes.
In addition, Mr. Fernandez has begun to stiffen curriculum requirements in math and science to improve students' prospects for jobs and college. The tougher standards haven't frightened kids away. School attendance is at the highest level in two decades. Many of Mr. Fernandez's changes have been accomplished just as the school system has been hit with over $700 million in budget cuts. Further large cuts risk turning these considerable, painstakingly won gains into losses.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Lessons For Americans

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

DATELINE: MADRID

 BODY:
Every day now, the new Europe shows it can be strong, united and independent of the United States -- but only until a real crisis comes along that it has to handle itself.
Then Europe becomes a vivid lesson for Americans in the value and strengths of their own country and its special system of government. 
 Thousands of Europeans are being slaughtered by other Europeans. European cities are being smashed. European separatists and terrorists all over the Continent watch to see what may be in it for them one day.
The disaster of Yugoslavia, once a nation, now a scream of agony, should have been crisis enough to persuade the leaders of the new Europe to put up or shut up. They do neither.
They do not have the courage to face the risks of forcing a decent settlement -- or even just stopping the bloodletting. But they remain magnificent when it comes to making statements of huff and puff. They look around for United States help without enough political guts to admit it.
Even a little time spent in Europe listening to the evasions of European leaders should be a great lesson for Americans. It should make them see more clearly the virtues of their own system, so often and so contemptuously dismissed by Europeans and even by themselves.
Western Europe has plenty of troops, planes and ships for the blockades and interdictions that could have smothered the war and forced real peace talks on the combatants. Why were they not used by the new Europe in this year of 1992 that was supposed to be the beginning of the new era of united European power?
Why do we hear, even from Spain's Prime Minister, Filipe Gonzalez, one of Europe's more straightforward and imaginative leaders, the story that the mechanisms, the structures, do not exist for collective action about Yugoslavia? If Europe has one thing in good supply it is structures and mechanisms.
The reason is that this time Europe does not have the United States to count on. It has soldiers and guns but it does not have the political and organizing power that the American Presidency, balanced and strengthened by Congressional backing and public support, can bring to meeting a crisis like Yugoslavia.
Yes, the Bush Administration was part of the West's disastrous buildup of Saddam Hussein and wound up leaving him in power. But when the U.S. decided to stop Saddam Hussein after Kuwait, President Bush had both the courage to act and the system that he needed behind him.
That was the combination -- the determination of a leader and a balanced, unified constitutional system -- that could create the coalition and open the rusty umbrella of the United Nations.
Neither is present now in Europe. Politically a united Europe is one more fictional creature that walks without clothes. Among other recent creations were Perestroika to save the Soviet Union, the Bush "new world order" and the idea that the United Nations has become some kind of separate entity that can take action without the initiative and permission of the major powers.
Yugoslavia showed that Europe is still a collection of states that have separate political needs and fears and will not march politically to the same drum for decades -- probably never.
Economically, where the price of unified action is just money, not blood, a united Europe may work. Maybe -- but before we place any bets let's wait until the first great European economic crisis, like heavy unemployment caused by heavy migration.
The Bush Administration has correctly decided that the civil war in Yugoslavia is one crisis that Europe ought to be able to handle on its own.
One day Americans may not be able to stomach any longer what European leaders keep swallowing -- the death of thousands of Europeans and the destruction of a part of European civilization. Then, with American help at hand, Europeans will suddenly discover those "mechanisms" for action that they have misplaced. But in the meantime Americans can learn a lesson:
The European concept of unity will never be an equal or a substitute for the strength and flexibility of the American constitutional system -- not for the U.S., not for the world and not for those abandoned Europeans living in the pool of blood that was once Yugoslavia.

HEADLINE: Kerner Report Said It All About Urban Unrest

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I had forgotten most of the details in the 1968 Kerner Commission report on civil disorders, but the Los Angeles rebellion sent me scurrying to find my old, dog-eared paperback copy. It had been last used in 1972 when I was serving as Special Assistant for Minority Affairs to the Commandant of the Marine Corps and trying to develop recommendations and solutions to the racial strife plaguing the Marine Corps then.
What an extraordinary document! If you were to read the Kerner Commission report today, you would probably think it was written, in many respects, in the aftermath of the Rodney King disturbances. I have just finished reading some portions of it again, and it is startling how little attention has been paid to the conclusions and recommendations from this report during the intervening years. 
 Allow me to quote several passages:
"The capability of a police department to control a civil disorder depends essentially on two factors: proper planning and competent performance.
"The way policemen approach an incident often determines whether it is contained or develops into a serious disorder.
"Unemployment and underemployment are among the persistent and serious grievances of disadvantaged minorities."
Basic program areas were identified for special strategies: Consolidating and concentrating employment efforts; opening the existing job structure; creating a million new jobs in the public sector in three years; creating a million new jobs in the private sector in three years; developing urban and rural poverty areas; encouraging business ownership in the ghetto; consolidating and concentrating employment efforts.
Thanks to the Kerner Commission report, it is clear that we don't need another study of the causes of urban unrest. Thanks, too, to Lyndon Johnson, we have the solution:
"The only genuine, long-range solution for what has happened lies in an attack -- mounted at every level -- upon the conditions that breed despair and violence. All of us know what those conditions are: ignorance, discrimination, slums, poverty, disease, not enough jobs. We should attack these conditions -- not because we are frightened by conflict, but because we are fired by conscience. We should attack them because there is simply no other way to achieve a decent and orderly society in America."
I hope the Kerner report becomes a "must read" item for all in positions of leadership who will be addressing solutions to the recent disturbances. I also hope we have the will to follow through with the recommendations this time. The next time may be too late.

HEADLINE: Help Russia Create a Stable Legal System

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Two Novelties in Russian Courts: Defense Lawyers and Jury Trials" (front page, May 11): Our experience in Russia and other former Soviet states confirms the conclusion that "for all the talk of constitutional and legal reform, there has not been very much of it."
Using as a model the way we and other human rights organizations function in the United States, the American Jewish Congress has tried to introduce Jewish members of the bar, both in the Soviet Union and later in its successor states, to the notion of aggressively using law and legislation to protect and promote individual rights. These efforts were substantially impeded by structural obstacles in the various judicial and administrative systems in these countries, and even more by the lack of understanding and experience by both legal practitioner and the public with initiatives of this kind. 
 In testimony before a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee early this month, we urged our Government to help promote in the successor states the creation of a body of substantive and procedural law that would encourage citizens to press claims and seek redress of rights violations.
Toward this end we urged the enlistment of law schools, bar associations, human rights associations and others in arranging workshops and symposiums, faculty exchange programs and apprenticeships in U.S. law firms and legal advocacy groups.
The emergence of a coherent and stable legal system will not only assure justice among the new republics' citizens but will provide the context necessary to encourage foreign investments. Parties to a transaction must be able to anticipate the results of their decisions. Investors demand assurance that agreements will be enforced, transactions honored, and that legal order will replace bureaucratic arbitrariness.
The creation of a reliable and fair legal system is an indispensable element not only in the evolution toward democracy but in the promotion of economic growth.

HEADLINE: Swords Into High-Tech Plowshares

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: COLD SPRING HARBOR, L.I., May 21

 BODY:
Three of Long Island's major research institutions joined forces today to form an institute to find commercial uses for highly technical research. The goal is to help the Island's military industry, its largest private employer, convert to peacetime products.
The new institute, the Long Island Research Institute, was founded by the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, the State University of New York at Stony Brook, and Associated Universities, the managing corporation of the Brookhaven National Laboratory. 
 "There's a lot of talent in these institutions and we want to get some of their ideas out into the marketplace," said Dr. Nicholas Samios, director of the Brookhaven National Laboratory. "We believe there is an untapped potential in the research community that can have an impact not only on the economy of Long Island, but the entire country."
While the end of the cold war has led many research institutions to study ways to convert military industries to peacetime uses, Dr. Samios said he knew of no other project in which three such diverse institutions had joined forces.
The effort comes at a time when the Government is seeking ways to help communities and companies to convert to peacetime pursuits. Congress is considering setting aside part of next year's military budget toward that end.
Officials said the institute would try to develop products in medical equipment and instrumentation, biotechnology, energy technologies, environmental analysis, advanced materials and information technology.
 
Seed Money From State
 The state is providing the institute with $400,000 in seed money. An additional $100,000 has been provided by the three sponsoring institutions, which hope to acquire more start-up funds from the Federal Government.
"We'd like to fill the vacuum being left by the receding defense industry and create the next major high-tech industry right here on Long Island," said Dr. Philip F. Palmedo, a nuclear engineer who was elected president and chief executive officer of the institute at its first meeting today at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.
Beth Delson, a spokeswoman for the Center for Economic Conversion in Mountain View, Calif., a clearinghouse for ideas to convert military production to peacetime products and jobs, said, "The regional approach of the Long Island Research Institute is unique and one that is welcome and should be encouraged."
Dr. Palmedo, who worked for 13 years at Brookhaven before setting up his own international consulting firm, said the institute hoped to "form a bridge between the research community and the business community to create new products and new jobs."
"Long Island has the real potential to become a significant high-tech region," he said. "The defense industry will obviously eventually disappear, and since we can't bring smokestacks in to replace it, we should look to the research base that is already here. That, combined with a highly educated work force and a favorable living environment, makes for a promising future."
 
A National Concern
 He said the issue of making effective economic and social use of a highly developed research industry was "not only a regional problem, but a national concern."
"We know the Japanese have long had a traditional connection between their research institutions and industry," he said. "They work very closely together with great success."
"In the United States, Federal support for research is entirely distinct from private industry," Dr. Palmedo said. "We would like to bridge that gap. If we're successful, we hope our results have national significance."
The institute hopes to attract corporate support.
"As we start the development of commercial ideas, we will seek funds from those who might like to buy a patent or manufacture products," Dr. Palmedo said.
For example, he said, Brookhaven was been working on energy and environmental technologies and has published the results in professional journals, but has put them to no commercial use.
At Stony Brook, he said, researchers were working on three-dimensional computer imaging that has had some military applications. "But we see a clear application in medicine for a three-dimensional imaging for the brain for use by brain surgeons," Dr. Palmedo said.
The new institute was officially constituted at this afternoon's first meeting of its board. Walter B. Kissinger, the brother of former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and president of the Kissinger Family Foundation, was elected chairman.
Initially, the institute will have its headquarters at 100 North Country Road, Setauket, at the offices of Dr. Palmedo's consulting company, the International Resource Group.
Other members of the board include John C. Bierwirth, former chairman of Grumman Corporation; G. Morgan Browne, administrative director of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory; Robert Hughes, president of Associated Universities; John H. Marburger, director of Brookhaven National Laboratory; Jerry R. Schubel, dean and director of the Marine Sciences Research Center at the State University at Stony Brook; James H. Simons, president of Renaissance Technologies Corporation; James Watson, director of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, and Frank G. Zarb, chairman of Smith Barney Harris Upham & Company.

HEADLINE: Bank Curbs Seen Having Little Effect Right Away

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 21

 BODY:
The new Federal rules setting limits on the interest rates that weak banks can pay depositors will have little immediate effect on the bulk of the industry or on customers, analysts said today. This is primarily because loan demand has been so weak that it has discouraged banks from offering higher rates.
What is more, although the new rules restrict interest rates and deposit-gathering by weaker banks, Federal regulators said today that they expected to grant most requests for waivers. The rules follow Congressional intent by trying to prevent another episode like that in the 1980's in which high-interest-rate deposits caused huge losses -- and an expensive Government bailout. But they do so in form, not substance, some experts said.
 
Some Banks on List
 The banks that will have to apply for permission to accept deposits from money brokers and to offer higher rates include the Chase Manhattan Bank, First National Bank of Chicago, First USA Bank, Bankers Trust, Imperial Bank and First Union, all of which did not qualify for the top tier of institutions based on their financial health at the end of last year, according to an analysis today by Sheshunoff Information Services. 
 The new rules, which were handed down Wednesday by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and will go into effect on June 16, will flatly prohibit the weakest banks and savings and loans from paying higher-than-average interest rates to attract deposits. No waiver will be allowed under the rules for these institutions.
The analysis by Sheshunoff, a banking research and consulting firm in Austin, Tex., also showed that these institutions, which will have to either lower their rates or shed millions of dollars in higher-interest-bearing deposits, include the Maryland National Bank, American Security Bank, the Massachusetts Company, the First American Bank of New York and Midlantic.
Paying higher-than-average interest rates had devastating consequences for the savings and loan industry in the 1980's, as many institution chased deposits gathered by brokers who sought high rates. Huge amounts of this money poured into federally insured institutions, allowing them to make large and risky loans, many of which turned sour. As losses mounted and banks needed still more deposits to stay liquid, the institutions bid up interest rates. Eventually, these high-cost deposits compounded the cost of the Government's savings and loan bailout.
"Regulation failed in preventing the savings and loan crisis so now regulation is attempting to manage the banks in the wake of the recession," said James J. McDermott, director of research at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, a bank research firm in New York. The rules represent the first attempt at regulating interest rates since 1986.
The new classifications are important beyond just brokered deposits because they may also become the standards for determining which financial institutions will pay higher premiums for Federal deposit insurance and which institutions will be able to expand.
 
The Three Groups
 Under the new rules, banks are classified into one of three groups. Those considered well capitalized are able to continue to offer brokered deposits and those considered adequately capitalized must get permission from the F.D.I.C. Banks ruled undercapitalized by the F.D.I.C. may not offer brokered deposits.
Federal regulators said they expected approval of requests from adequately-capitalized banks if they found that they were being supervised properly.
"There's a presumption that they will be approved unless they hear from us," said Robert F. Miailovich, an assistant director of supervision at the F.D.I.C. "We will do our darndest to make sure it's not a long drawn out regulatory process."
The agency Wednesday defined well-capitalized banks as those with a leverage ratio -- the total of equity capital and retained earnings as a share of total assets -- of 5 percent or more and a broader risk-based capital ratio of 10 percent. Adequately capitalized are those institutions lower than the top standard but with a leverage ratio of 4 percent and a risk-based ratio of 8 percent.
 
Chase Manhattan Cited
 Analysts said that Chase Manhattan, with more than $3 billion in brokered deposits, had the largest amount of such higher-yielding deposits in the class of institutions that are considered to be adequately capitalized and would need to apply for a waiver to continue holding such funds. First National Bank of Chicago, First Union and Bankers Trust are also in this category and each holds more than $1 billion in brokered deposits.
Among those institutions considered "uncapitalized," the Maryland National Bank of Baltimore had nearly $2 billion in brokered deposits in December, followed by the First National Bank of Boston, which had $1.7 billion, and American Security Bank, which had $1.4 billion.
 The article also referred incompletely to the role of Sheshunoff Information Services in providing data for the article and the table. The company drew no conclusions about the weakness or strength of any bank mentioned in the article.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 25, 1992, Monday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Friday about new Federal rules setting limits on bank interest rates and brokered deposits misstated the amount of brokered deposits held at the end of the year by the First Union National Bank, of Charlotte, N.C. It was $319.3 million.
A table with the article, listing the two groups of banks that face regulation of their brokered deposits and interest rates under the new rules, included two banks incorrectly in the group that would be prohibited from accepting brokered deposits or paying unusually high rates. The York Bank and Trust Company and the Massachusetts Company should not have been listed.

GRAPHIC: Table: "Rate Limits for Weaker Banks"
 This week the F.D.I.C. separated the nation's banks and savings and loans into three groups based on financial health. The weaker two groups face regulation of the deposits they can accept and the rates they can offer. Here are the 10 banks in each of the two weakest groups that had the most deposits from money brokers seeking high rates. Figures are in millions, for Dec. 31, 1991
 
High-Rate Deposits Restricted
 Banks with merely adequate capital under the new standards would have to get a waiver to accept brokered deposits or offer unusually high interest rates.

HEADLINE: After Weeks of Seeming Inaction, U.S. Decides to Punish Belgrade

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, May 22

 BODY:
The Bush Administration, trying to take the initiative after weeks of apparent inaction in the face of Serbian aggression in Bosnia, today announced new sanctions against Belgrade. The measures, while limited, put the United States ahead of Europe in efforts to deter the Serbian leadership of Yugoslavia.
The Administration ordered Yugoslav consulates in New York and San Francisco closed and their diplomats expelled. The Government also expelled Belgrade's military attaches in Washington, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d announced here tonight. The third consulate, in Chicago, will remain open. 
 Calling the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina a "humanitarian nightmare," Mr. Baker also said the Administration would urge the European Community to consider similar measures. He said he expected to take up the subject Saturday in Lisbon where all the European nations will be represented at a meeting on aid to the former Soviet republics.
 
Recognition Is Withheld
 The actions came as Belgrade's Serbian-dominated Army and Serbian irregulars in Bosnia and Herzegovina continued to attack non-Serbs and block relief supplies.
Mr. Baker, who has been criticized along with President Bush for not taking stronger measures against the Government of President Slobodan Milosevic of the now-truncated Yugoslavia, said that if diplomatic, political and economic measures failed, "then and only then" would the United States consider discussing whether a European force should be sent to Bosnia. Such action has been proposed by the Western European Union, a defense group of European nations.
The Administration has also decided to withhold recognition of the Serbian-dominated Government in Belgrade until Serbian forces are withdrawn from Bosnia and Herzegovina and peace is restored to the former republic, Mr. Baker told reporters after a meeting with Prime Minister John Major of Britain.
Mr. Baker, speaking at 10 Downing Street, said the United States had two immediate objectives: to see Sarajevo Airport reopened and humanitarian aid get through to Bosnia. "We feel that what is happening in Bosnia-Herzegovina is unconscionable," he said, urging cooperation from "others in the civilized world, who, like us, are unwilling to sit and watch what is really a humanitarian nightmare."
He also said he found the British Government to be "totally and completely understanding" of the American position.
The United States Ambassador to Belgrade, Warren Zimmermann, who was recalled last weekend for consultations, will not be returning to Yugoslavia, Mr. Baker said, and the Embassy staff in Belgrade will be reduced.
The Bush Administration, which lagged behind the European Community over the last year -- first in recognizing the breakaway Yugoslav republics of Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, and then in withdrawing ambassadors from Belgrade -- is now expected to urge the Europeans to take stronger measures.
The European Community's executive commission has recommended a trade embargo on Serbia and Montenegro. In a report, the commission said that an embargo on exports from Serbia and Montenegro could have "an important impact" on the two republics since more than 50 percent of their foreign sales are to the community.
The commission recommended freezing the federation's assets at the International Monetary Fund, but noted that most other assets have already been withdrawn from Western banks.
Community foreign ministers are expected to discuss the report -- and announce new sanctions -- after they meet with Mr. Baker on Saturday.
Among some Administration policy makers, there is considerable impatience with the European Community, which tries to work by consensus, getting the agreement of all 12 members before taking action.
On Wednesday the Bush Administration denied the Yugoslav national airline landing rights at American airports. And European nations are considering similar measures, officials said here today.
 
Nuclear Pact on Agenda
 In addition to the weekend conference on how to better deliver international aid to and encourage reforms in the former Soviet Union, Mr. Baker will attempt to put the finishing touches on an agreement with the members of the Commonwealth of Independent States -- Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan -- that have nuclear weapons on their soil. The Administration was hoping that the agreement to sign and ratify the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty would be signed on Sunday.
Today, Mr. Baker said that there were still some issues to be decided.
"We've been at this for the better part of almost six months and as far as I'm concerned, I'll believe it's put to bed when it's put to bed, because things continually come up," he told reporters on his plane en route from Washington.
After the Lisbon meetings, Mr. Baker will go on to the former Soviet republic of Georgia where he will meet with Eduard A. Shevardnadze, a former Soviet Foreign Minister who is now head of the Georgian State Council, an interim administration that has tried to end a civil war that broke out there shortly after the new nation declared independence.

Aid Convoys Are Suspended
 BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, May 22 (Special to The New York Times) -- The United Nations' main refugee-relief organization announced today that it was suspending aid convoys to Bosnia and Herzegovina, a day after Serbian gunmen hijacked a dozen United Nations trucks loaded with food and medicine.
The announcement was a blow to humanitarian aid efforts in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where food and medical supplies have shrunk to critically low levels.
"We have been facing increasing difficulty in terms of security and access to the displaced in Bosnia and Herzegovina," said Jose Maria Mendiluce, special envoy to Yugoslavia of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. "There are many armed groups that do not answer to any authority or political party."
"I will not put at risk my staff, drivers or the staff of other non-governmental organizations or the security of the food itself," he said. "In this context, we will not undertake any new operations."
"I hope it will only be a matter of days before we get the security assurances we need to operate," Mr. Mendiluce said, and other officials of the High Commissioner's office insisted that the organization is not completely ending its operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: House Race;
After 115 Years, a Black Will Represent Alabama

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MONTGOMERY, Ala.

 BODY:
The one thing that is certain about the crowded field seeking to represent Alabama's newly apportioned Seventh Congressional District is that from its ranks will come the state's first black member of Congress in 115 years.
The race in the district, which has a voting-age population that is two-thirds black, has attracted six black Democrats and three black Republicans to run in the June 2 primaries. 
 The size and composition of the field is not only a result of population statistics culled from the 1990 census, but also the culmination of a growing tide of black political activity in Alabama since the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
That activity has produced 705 current black elected officials in the state, giving Alabama the largest number of black legislators, school board members, mayors, council members, sheriffs and county commissioners of any state. It has made the black vote the crucial swing factor in several statewide elections. And it has spawned a spirited competition among rival black political organizations.
The state's voting-age population is 25 percent black, but a presence in the seven-member House delegation has so far eluded black politicians. And it is only because of court-drawn redistricting and the requirements of 1982 amendments to the Voting Rights Act that Alabama now seems assured of electing a black representative.
David Bositis, a senior researcher with the Joint Center for Political and Economics Studies in Washington, said that because of this recent political history the race in the new Seventh Congressional District reflects particular vibrance.
 
'A Pretty Impressive Field'
 "What is interesting is the amount of political experience you find in this field of candidates, and in that sense it is a pretty impressive field of people with their own political bases and track records," he said. "It's more competitive than most Congressional races, and therefore people have to pay closer attention."
The last black Congressman from Alabama was Jeremiah Harralson, a former slave who was elected from Selma, in the state's fertile cotton-growing Black Belt. He, like two earlier Reconstruction-era black Republicans, James T. Rapier, and Benjamin Turner, were ultimately ousted amid the resurgence of the Democratic Party, the growth of Jim Crowism and quite a bit of voter fraud, said William D. Barnard, a history professor at the University of Alabama.
The new Seventh District was drawn by a Federal District Court after a challenge by Gov. Guy Hunt, a Republican, to the plan drawn by the Democratic-controlled State Legislature.
In a number of states where Republican governors have found themselves at odds with their legislatures, a strategy has emerged of taking the disputes to Federal courts in the belief that Republican appointees in the judiciary would view the disputes in ways more favorable to Republicans.
 
Black Areas and White Areas
 As a result, in Alabama as in many other states, the new voting districts have concentrated urban and rural black voters, leaving many other areas whiter, more suburban and potentially more Republican.
In accomplishing this, Mr. Barnard said, the new Seventh District "yokes together by violence" areas as geographically different but racially similar as a large portion of industrial Birmingham and vast stretches of the rural Black Belt, where the small populations of some counties are as much as 60 to 70 percent black. It also dips into the state's other major urban area, here in Montgomery.
The Republicans in the race are Kervin Jones of Tuscaloosa, Jonathan McPherson of Hueytown and Alfred Middleton Sr. of Birmingham. But the district is overwhelmingly Democratic, and it is the Democratic candidates who are the better known and more established.
The candidate who is viewed as the favorite in the Democratic race is Earl Hilliard, a 50-year-old State Senator from Birmingham, which includes more than 45 percent of the district's population. Mr. Hilliard has the strong support of Richard Arrington, the Mayor of Birmingham.
One of Mr. Hilliard's principal opponents also is a State Senator. He is Hank Sanders, 49, a Harvard-educated lawyer from Selma who represents 8 of the 14 counties in the district.
 
Extensive Political Experience

 Other Democrats who have extensive political experience are State Representative E. B. McClain, 52, a three-term lawmaker from Bessemmer and Fairfield, just outside Birmingham, and County Commissioner John Knight, 46, an administrator at predominantly black Alabama State University in Montgomery. Mr. Knight is a longtime leader in the Alabama Democratic Conference, the state's oldest and perhaps most influential black political group.
Rounding out the Democratic field is Sam Taylor, 34, a former Washington aide to Representative Claude Harris, the white incumbent who has decided against running in the newly apportioned district, and State Representative James Thomas, 48, a four-term lawmaker, school principal and businessman from the Black Belt.
If no candidate receives more than 50 percent of the vote in the primary there will be a runoff, something most of the candidates concede is likely because of the crowded field.
Three of the state's important black political organizations have made endorsements in the race, with Mr. Sanders getting the support of the Alabama New South Coalition, Mr. Hilliard the support of the Jefferson County Citizens Committee and Mr. Knight, the Alabama Democratic Conference.

HEADLINE: French and Germans Plan an Army Corps Despite NATO Fears

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, May 22

 BODY:
Ignoring concern being voiced in Washington and London that they may be undermining NATO, the leaders of France and Germany today approved formation of a 35,000-member joint army corps with the aim of turning it into the nucleus of a future European army.
Meeting in the western French port of La Rochelle, President Francois Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl said the so-called European Corps would become operational on Oct. 1, 1995, and would have European defense, peacekeeping outside Europe and humanitarian actions as its main missions. They argued that it would help give the European Community its "own military capability." 
 They invited other members of a nine-nation military pact known as the Western European Union to join the corps. So far, Belgium, Luxembourg and Spain have shown interest in doing so.
The idea of turning an existing 4,200-man joint French-German military brigade into a fully fledged army corps comprising one French armored division and two German mechanized brigades was first raised by Paris and Bonn in October in the context of the community's debate on closer political unity.
But the speed with which the two Governments have formalized the initiative has stirred fears in some Western capitals that the European Corps could challenge the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's traditional domination of European security questions and damage its credibility.
Aware of these worries, Mr. Mitterrand and Mr. Kohl insisted in a joint statement today that the corps "will contribute to strengthening the Atlantic alliance." They also recalled that Washington had often demanded greater "burden sharing" by its allies in the cost of protecting Europe.
"We're doing what the Americans have asked us to do for years -- be able to assure our own defense," Mr. Kohl said at a news conference. Sitting beside him, Mr. Mitterrand added: "We want the presence of Americans in Europe. We know what we owe to NATO."
But concerns remain above all because France, which withdrew its troops from NATO's military command in 1966, has long regarded the 16-nation alliance as an instrument of American foreign and military policy and would like to see its political influence reduced in the post-cold-war era.
 
Warning From U.S. Envoy
 Speaking on Thursday, apparently in response to prior information of today's announcement, the American Ambassador to NATO, William H. Taft 4th, warned that "undermining the alliance's integrated military structure in the uncertain process of developing a European security identity would be the height of folly."
The American Defense Secretary, Dick Cheney, sounded more conciliatory on Wednesday when he said formation of the force "is probably basically a sound proposal." In private, though, American officials make no secret of their distrust of French motives.
Britain's Defense Secretary, Malcolm Rifkind, said today that "the criteria we will apply is whether it will strengthen or weaken NATO." But a senior official in Prime Minister John Major's office said the corps could create "confusion and uncertainty" and he asked, "What precisely is it there for?"
As seen from NATO's Brussels headquarters, where officials are struggling to design a new post-cold-war strategy for the alliance, the corps is a signal that, sooner or later, the 12-nation European Community will want the freedom to act militarily without depending on the United States.
 
Yugoslav War Cited
 French officials point to the civil war in Yugoslavia as an example of a situation where NATO is constrained by its charter from acting "out of area" but where a future European army could help make or keep the peace. Now, though, the community lacks both authority and instruments to do so.
In promoting the European Corps, France has also seen an opportunity to strengthen its ties with Germany and to demonstrate that at a time when a united Germany is rapidly emerging as Europe's dominant power, Paris and Bonn are still jointly setting the pace of European integration.
Aware of French apprehension about new German might, Mr. Kohl has often stressed the continuing importance of what is known as the Paris-Bonn "axis." Mr. Mitterrand has in turn repeatedly sought ways of requiring Germany to acknowledge publicly that France remains its political equal.
In the case of the European Corps, Paris placed Bonn in a particularly difficult position, not only because the German Constitution still forbids it from sending troops outside NATO's European sphere of operation, but also because Mr. Kohl is anxious not to be seen by Washington as undercutting NATO.
In the end, Germany went along with today's announcement, with military planning to begin in detail when the corps' headquarters is established in the French border city of Strasbourg on July 1. But many complicated political problems remain unresolved.
 
Opposition in Germany
 The German Defense Minister, Volker Ruhe, acknowledged today that a constitutional change would be required if German troops were to carry out all the corps' proposed missions. But the opposition Social Democratic Party has pledged to block any amendment allowing German troops to be sent outside the NATO area.
If no such amendment is approved before October 1995, one of the justifications for the corps -- its ability to defend European interests outside the NATO area -- will disappear, leaving it to duplicate NATO's military responsibilities in Europe and to carry out humanitarian actions abroad.
France and Germany also have different interpretations of the corps' peacetime role, with Paris arguing that its division and Germany's two brigades should be assigned exclusively to the corps and Bonn insisting that its forces will be "double hatted" and will answer first to NATO.
This week, the Secretary General of the Western European Union, Willem van Eekelen, said the new corps' relationship with NATO had still to be clarified, while NATO's retiring military chief, Gen. John Galvin, said NATO should retain the first option to mobilize the force.
 
Other Ties Unclear
 No clearer is the corps' relationship with the Western European Union. Community leaders agreed in December that the organization should become the new European defense pillar, subservient to NATO on European military matters but free to act outside the NATO area. For the moment, though, the corps will be answerable only to Paris and Bonn.
This month, the competition between military groups has become even more intense. Last week, the British Defense Secretary said London was ready to make troops and a command center available to the Western European Union. He also said the union should be able to call on European forces assigned to a new rapid reaction force being set up by NATO.
This week, NATO's Secretary General, Manfred Worner, said the alliance had agreed to offer its peacekeeping and humanitarian services to the 52-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, a move that -- if accepted -- could result in NATO forces being given missions outside Western Europe.

HEADLINE: U.S. Says It Misjudged Numbers on Student Aid

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 22

 BODY:
The Bush Administration said today that it had underestimated the number of college students eligible for a major Federal scholarship aid program, but that all students who qualified for the grant this year would receive it.
In testimony before a Senate appropriations committee earlier this week, Education Secretary Lamar Alexander said his department had predicted that 3.7 million students would receive Pell grants, the main Federal higher education aid program to college students. But he said more than four million students actually qualified for the next school year, producing a $1.1 billion shortfall in the budget. 
 "We were wrong on our estimate," Mr. Alexander told the Senate committee Wednesday. "We missed it." Mr. Alexander offered no explanation for the error, but Etta Fielek, a spokesman for the department, today described the method the department uses to calculate the number of students receiving the grants as being less a matter of science "than instincts and guesswork."
"In this case our crystal ball broke and about 300,000 more students received Pell grants than we anticipated," said Ms. Fielek.
 
No Grants Being Cut
 But Ms. Fielek said that no student who has received notification of the amount of his or her Pell grant would get a reduced grant as a consequence of the underestimation.
"You've got that many more people of all ages taking advantage of the best system of higher education in the world," said Ms. Fielek. "The Government wants to support students in school. The commitment is there. And no student is going to suffer. We would not under any circumstances go back and adjust those amounts. But it a serious bookkeeping problem."
The department has not yet decided how to cover the shortage, but the money will have to be taken from some other programs' appropriations.
Education experts say that the increase in the number of students applying for the grants is a result of a stagnant economy. Students are staying in school longer because of a lack of job opportunities; adults are going back to school to sharpen skills or to retrain for better-paying jobs.
 
Political Factors Seen
 "This is just mostly due to the recession," said David Merkowitz, director of public affairs for the American Council on Education. "It's not a big surprise, but the department's underestimates have been chronic, which has been somewhat a political thing on their part."
The miscalculation comes at a time when Republicans and Democrats in Congress had hoped to increase the grant level and expand the program's support by including more middle-class students.
"Everybody was hopeful about getting an expansion into the middle class, but more importantly an increase in the size of the maximum award," said Mr. Merkowitz. "This miscalculation forecloses that possibility."
The Pell grant program is the chief Federal program for aid to undergraduates. In the school year just ending, it provided $5.3 billion in direct grants to 3.4 million college students, most of them from families earning less than $35,000 a year. The maximum grant of $2,400 is based on need and college cost, not academic merit.
 
Centerpiece of Policy
 Administration officials have promoted Mr. Bush's education-legislation package and the $1.6 billion increase in the education budget as the centerpiece of White House domestic policy.
Now some Congressional critics maintain that the miscalculation is a politically motivated attempt to blame Congress for cutting back other social programs, like Head Start, to make up the shortfall in the college program.
"The $1.6 billion increase in discretionary spending the Department so proudly announced in January is now completely gone," said Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, during the appropriation's committee hearings. "This spending boost will be soaked up by the Pell grant shortfall and other new requirements unless the Administration can come up with a solution."

HEADLINE: Violence Flares Again in Delivery Drivers Dispute

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL

 BODY:
In a surge of violence in the 16-day-old newspaper delivery dispute, a replacement driver was critically injured late Thursday by a brick-size rock thrown through the window of a bus carrying nonunion workers into a New Rochelle, N.Y., newspaper distribution center, the New Rochelle police said.
The worker, Gary Lee Mauney, 50 years old, from Fayetteville, N.C., was hit in the head. He underwent 12 hours of surgery in New Rochelle Hospital and was in critical condition in the intensive-care unit, police and hospital officials said last night. 
 Charged in the incident was one of nine union drivers for whom the union had been demanding amnesty for earlier complaints. Disagreement over the amnesty issue unexpectedly derailed a union ratification vote scheduled for this week on proposed contracts with The New York Times and Arthur E. Imperatore, the newspaper distributor who owns the center in New Rochelle where the attack occurred. Union officials were trying to reschedule a vote for next week.
The latest violence, which included other reported overnight incidents, hardened Mr. Imperatore's stance against amnesty, his lawyer, Jerold E. Glassman, said in a statement yesterday. Mr. Glassman said the amnesty demand was to blame for "giving a lawless element the impression that any misconduct or violent act will be forgiven at the conclusion of a labor dispute."
Douglas LaChance, the president of the Newspaper and Mail Deliverers' Union of New York and Vicinity, called the incident in New Rochelle "very unfortunate" and acknowledged that "it makes things more complicated."
Mr. LaChance went to the New Rochelle center last night to talk to the drivers on the picket line, telling them that he deplored violence on both sides. He also said that he was not convinced the arrested driver was guilty in the rock-throwing incident. "When some guy from North Carolina unfortunately got hurt, I'm sorry he got hurt," Mr. LaChance added, "but what is he doing here from North Carolina? Except to perpetrate economic despair on these poor people here, who are all legitimate working guys."
But labor advisers for both sides who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that concern over the violence and worries that it might increase could prompt a speedier resolution in the dispute. Moreover, they said, focusing attention on the amnesty issue might make it, and not the contract itself, the primary obstacle a settlement. If that could be resolved, they said, the rest of the dispute might well follow.
The arrested driver was identified as Robert Boyle, 27, of the Bronx. He was charged with second-degree assault, criminal possession of a weapon and criminal mischief, and held without bail pending further investigation, said Detective Lieut. Anthony Murphy, a spokesman for the New Rochelle police.
Lieutenant Murphy said a tour bus was carrying the replacement drivers from a local motel into Westfair Newspaper Distributors Company in a downtown industrial park about 11:15 P.M. Thursday when the rock was thrown through a side window. A second passenger, Tom Haynesworth, 41, also of Fayetteville, was treated for facial cuts and released, the police said.
Saying he deplored violence "on both sides," Mr. LaChance said in his Queens union hall last night that he still hoped to reach an agreement on the fate of at least the eight other workers, clearing the way for a rescheduled vote next week.
Before the members are four contracts -- one with The Times, two with delivery companies whose assets The Times has contracted to acquire, and one with Mr. Imperatore's Imperial Delivery Service -- that would secure the jobs of some 1,000 current permanent drivers in exchange for attrition, sharp cuts in guaranteed overtime and other economies.
From the companies' perspective, the contracts seek to secure labor peace through the year 2000 and clear the way for the opening of a new Times printing plant in Edison, N.J. The contracts would give management considerable new leeway in redrawing routes and curbing overtime. They would also permit the first introduction of part-time workers, while easing driver advancement and providing some wage and benefit increases.
 
Earlier Contract Rejected
 An earlier version of the contracts, also approved by the union leadership, was decisively rejected by the membership on May 6. Mr. Imperatore then hired replacement drivers for the Westfair center and a second distribution center in East Farmingdale, L.I., setting off the dispute.
Mr. LaChance, who is besieged by vocal dissidents and other opponents in the ranks, sought this week to win amnesty for some of the union pickets charged with disruptions at Mr. Imperatore's two suburban centers as a way of bringing in a victory that could help pass the contracts. But Mr. LaChance said yesterday that Mr. Glassman backed out of an understanding on amnesty that left the union leader embarrassed and exposed.
Mr. Glassman acknowledged yesterday that "we had the germ of a settlement" but he said it had not yet been agreed on when Thursday night's violence "took amnesty off the table."
The Times's publisher, Arthur Sulzberger Jr., said yesterday that the latest violence nearly cost a life and said "these terrible actions must cease."
"I'm saddened by the events of last night and also by the slow response to them by the New Rochelle Police Department," he said in a statement.
Lieutenant Murphy said the police did respond quickly and added: "Both sides complained about us -- we just walk the line."
 
Times Cites Other Incidents
 A Times spokeswoman, Nancy Nielsen, said there were several other "serious acts of violence" that in some cases delayed delivery of papers to parts of Manhattan and Long Island.
At 3:30 A.M. yesterday, she said, a truck owned by Metropolitan News, a New York City distributor that is one of the two wholesalers The Times plans to acquire, was "hijacked" in lower Manhattan by three men wearing bandannas over their faces. After forcing the driver to abandon the truck, they fled with it, she said.
The New York City police said that in a second incident an hour later, three men made off with another Metropolitan News truck while the driver was making a delivery inside 157 West 124th Street in Manhattan. Three men were later arrested. The police identified them as Gerald McGraw, 24, of Babylon, L.I.; Peter Rauchut, 33, of Lake Ronkonkoma, L.I., and William Groh, 26, of Bellport, L.I.
In the legal arena, Judge Pierre N. Leval of Federal District Court in Manhattan, enforcing an earlier finding, entered a judgment against the union yesterday for $100,000 for violating a contempt order not to interfere with Times deliveries.

HEADLINE: Washington Memo;
A Year for Repackaging Volatile Census Reports

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 22

 BODY:
Concern is growing among Census Bureau employees that the Bush Administration, with its eye on the election, may be impeding access to economic statistics that tell the country about itself. While the bureau has dispensed demographic data from the 1990 census with uncommon speed, the openness has been less evident in the handling of economic news that could be politically volatile in this election year. Economic reports have been delayed, retitled and repackaged in recent months. Discouraging statistics have been presented to the public through rose-colored news releases, and some numbers have been made public without notice.
In the last three months, two reports that at best gave a mixed picture of jobs and poverty were delayed during long negotiations between the authors and the public information office over the wording of the accompanying news releases. The practice of putting experts' names and telephone numbers on news releases was abandoned, and restrictions were placed on public relations employees in the bureau. 
 "There's been somewhat of a change," said Daniel Weinberg, chief of the bureau's division on housing and household economic statistics. "Any Administration would be sensitive to economic figures."
 
'Major Behavioral Change'
 Another bureau researcher, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said: "It's a major behavioral change going on. This place has always been wide open. A lot of people see a drive to alter that."
The change is evident in bureau policy concerning contacts with news organizations. An old Commerce Department policy, which makes it more difficult for the reporters of major news organizations to gain access to Government experts, was recirculated at the Census Bureau after two researchers spoke openly with reporters about delicate subjects.
In one case a researcher, Beth DaPonte, gave a public interest group estimates of Iraqi deaths in the Persian Gulf war that exceeded the Pentagon's. Bureau employees said Ms. DaPonte's superior tried to dismiss her and then relented. Ms. DaPonte told colleagues that the action was simply political retaliation.
In another case a bureau analyst, Jack McNeil, gave several interviews on his latest findings on the widening gap between the incomes of the richest and poorest Americans. When news reports appeared, an associate undersecretary at the Commerce Department, the bureau's parent agency, complained to the bureau's public information director.
Later, both people, Susan Howard of the Commerce Department and Karen Wheeless of the Census Bureau, said the complaint had involved the bureau's failure to notify the Commerce Department of the interviews.
 
Data Unchanged
 A Commerce Department official, also speaking on the condition that he not be identified, said it was appropriate for researchers to comment on the factual content of reports. But he added: "The question is, if you decide to work for the Government, do you still have the academic freedom to say anything you damn well please? I think it's pretty clear that if you work for the Government and the Census Bureau, that you don't state opinions where it isn't appropriate for you to reach opinions. These people aren't on a level to be speaking for the Government."
In no case did anyone say that the Administration had tried to change data. The concerns involved the way statistics were presented and whether reporters were denied access to experts, important issues at an institution that employees call the "fact factory."
The new policy on news contacts is being reconsidered in the wake of the uproar that ensued when Mr. Weinberg announced the policy in an April 27 memorandum. It said, in part, that bureau employees could not "give out simple numbers, such as the number of housing units in the U.S.," unless such a contact had been cleared by the public information office.
 
Disagreement at Top
 Barbara Everitt Bryant, the bureau's director, said in a recent interview: "The Dan Weinberg memo is not bureau policy. I'm working to correct this misunderstanding."
In the last year, the bureau's Assistant Director for Communications, John J. Connolly, who is a political appointee, has been on the pre-publication distribution list for all bureau reports. "I don't edit reports," Mr. Connolly said. "I do ask a lot of questions about press releases."
One recent report, highlighting the growth in the number of low-paying jobs, was eventually released months behind schedule with no accompanying news release. "That was my news judgment," Ms. Wheeless said, adding that she did not believe that the report had added to information in earlier reports.
A second report, on the creation of new jobs, was accompanied by a news release that highlighted the number of people entering jobs in "high-paying" industries but that did not note that about half of the workers were paid less than $200 a week.

HEADLINE: PATENTS;
Cold War Secrecy Still Shrouds Inventions

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 22

 BODY:
Despite the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Federal Government is still placing gag orders on nearly 6,000 inventions that it believes could threaten national security, according to recent data obtained by a public interest group.
Imposed by the Patent and Trademark Office under a 1951 law called the Invention Secrecy Act, these secrecy orders block patents from being issued and in many cases prohibit the inventors from selling or licensing their technology to anybody except the Government -- regardless of whether the technology was developed with private or Government money. 
 The biggest growth in secrecy orders has not been those imposed on military secrets, like the blueprints for making nuclear weapons, but rather from "dual use" technologies that can be used for both commercial and military purposes. These can range from certain kinds of computer hardware to advanced ceramic materials, laser systems, semiconductor manufacturing technologies and automated process control systems.
Newly available data, obtained from the Patent Office under the Freedom of Information Act by the Federation of American Scientists, show that the number of new secrecy orders increased steadily from 290 in 1979 to 774 in 1991 and that some of the biggest increases took place in the last three years. The total number of secrecy orders in effect has grown steadily in the last decade, from 3,600 in 1979 to 5,893 in 1991.
No complaints have been heard from companies that have received secrecy orders, which still amount to less than 1 percent of the patents issued each year. But the new numbers surprised and disturbed some patent experts.
"The number is higher than I would have expected," said Herbert Wamsley, executive director of Intellectual Property Owners Inc., a lobbying group for inventors here. "The concern about a large number of these orders is that they could impair plans to commercialize valuable new technology."
Steven Aftergood, head of the Project on Government Secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists, said the rise in secrecy orders was at odds with national interests in the 1990's. "It makes no sense," he said. "At a time when the military threat is receding and the economic threat is on the rise, it is anomalous at best that restrictions on new inventions should be skyrocketing."
In secrecy orders imposed for purposes of export control, a company may sell or license its product within the United States to those who have legitimate business interests, but it cannot even reveal details of the technology or sell the product to foreign companies. These export control orders accounted for less than 10 percent of secrecy orders imposed in 1980, but almost half of those issued last year.
Perhaps the most surprising shift is that a growing proportion of the inventions placed under wraps are ones in which the Government does not hold title to the patent. Some of these inventions have been developed in part with Government funds, but the companies that obtain the patent hold all or part of the ownership interests.
In 1991, fully three-quarters of all new secrecy orders -- 506 out of 774 -- were imposed on inventions patented by private companies. By contrast, a study by the House Government Operations Committee in 1982 reported that in 1979 about 43 of 290 secrecy orders, or about one-seventh of the total, were imposed on non-Government inventions.
Robert Garrett, director of the office that oversees secrecy orders at the Patent and Trademark Office, said the secrecy orders were not as ominous as they might seem because the export control orders were more lenient than imposed on "classified" technology. But he refrained from commenting on whether the orders represent appropriate policy. "It's the law, and it's what I'm charged with the responsibility for administering," he said.
Robert E. Garrett, director of the office that oversees secrecy orders at the Patent and Trademark Office, acknowledged that the restrictions were unusual in that they could block the publication of information developed entirely by private individuals. The only comparable law is the one that prohibits people from publishing information about building atomic weapons.
But Mr. Garrett argued that patents represented a unique source of how-to information, in part because inventors are required by law fully to disclose the details necessary for others to reproduce the invention. He also noted that the collapse of Communism in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe had not put an end to security threats from countries like Iraq and Libya or from terrorists.
In addition, Mr. Garrett said the Pentagon was now in the process of revising its list of "militarily critical" technologies that are likely to be kept secret. In the last several months, he said, Pentagon officials have recommended fewer secrecy orders than they did last year, but he said it remained unclear whether this was a blip or the start of a trend.
John Preston, head of licensing for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said that his university had received several secrecy orders over the years but that almost all had stemmed from inventions at the Lincoln Laboratory, which M.I.T. operates under contract for the Federal Government.
In one exception, he said, the Federal Government has tried to impose a secrecy order on a patent application for producing energy through "cold fusion" technology, an area of research that generated great excitement several years ago but now appears to be ineffective.
But Mr. Preston echoed the view that some restrictions were still necessary in the post-cold-war world. "There are definitely reasons to keep some of our research secret," he said. "Making it easier for a small Middle Eastern country to make nuclear weapons is not a prospect that makes me feel comfortable."

HEADLINE: Saratoga's Sparkling Spring Is Stilled No More

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y.

 BODY:
Since a spring of sparkling water was found hundreds of feet below sand and rock on a farm here in 1872, the Saratoga Mineral Water Company has been a good-luck charm and a goodwill ambassador for this genteel city.
So for a place that takes its waters as seriously as its horses, it was a dismal day last August when the company's most recent owner, the French company Evian, succumbed to the dual pressures of the recession and the crowded bottled-water market and closed the company, apparently for good. 
 Throughout the state, companies have been folding and workers laid off. But sometimes, enough is enough. In Saratoga Springs a group of investors, motivated as much by civic pride as by business, decided that whatever happened, they could not let the company die without a fight.
 
Workers Return
 After months of negotiations with Evian, they bought Saratoga Mineral Water. Almost all the laid-off workers returned, even the ones who had found new jobs. Later this month, the water in the slender, icy-clear bottles will be tumbling off the production line once again.
The return of Saratoga Mineral Water is, in part, a small victory in the midst of a lingering recession. It is also the story of local people offended by the big-company attitudes of a foreign conglomerate that seemed to have little time to focus on a tiny American company, even one that meant so much to the community.
"Saratoga water was always in the refrigerator when I was growing up and when I heard it was shut down I thought it was someone's idea of a bad joke," said Anthony Malatino, a local stockbroker who, with several partners and the support of the Center for Economic Growth in Albany, a private agency, raised the millions of dollars needed to buy the company. They won't say exactly how much they raised, but it was between $4 million and $5 million, a local businessman said.
"The president of Evian's only trip up here was a seven-minute meeting to shut the plant down," Mr. Malatino said. "I believe that he had to ask for directions."
To understand what makes Saratoga Mineral Water so special is to understand the history of a city whose original Indian name is a reference to the bubbly water that comes from under the ground.
As long as people have been traveling to Saratoga to soak in the luxurious spas (in which a guest sits naked as carbonated water shoots at the body from every direction), and to bet on the horses, they have been drinking the water from the springs.
In the late 19th century, when Saratoga Mineral Water was founded under the name Saratoga Vichy, residents became accustomed to drinking "Scotch and Vichy," swearing that, because of its fine natural carbonation, it never led to a hangover. In 1892, the water won a gold medal in the World Columbian Exposition in Chicago, and a drawing of the bottle appeared on the front cover of Harper's Magazine. Last year, the company shipped thousands of cases to the U.S.S. Saratoga, during the Persian Gulf war.
 
A Friendly Company
 If ever a company could be called friendly, this one could. The workers happily wear company T-shirts, pride themselves on "cross training" -- meaning they know how to work on many pieces of equipment, so they don't get too bored -- and appreciate the way the company's chief operating officer, Mark Wiggins, challenges them to games of horseshoes on lazy Friday afternoons (he usually wins).
Plus, they say, they get to drink the water. (Connoisseurs swear that what makes it special is that it has smaller-than-usual bubbles, giving it a Champagne sort of feel, but such subtleties are lost on the lay person.)
"It's great water," said Ernie Wren, a 51-year-old forklift operator, whose father worked at the plant for 20 years and who has put in 30 years himself. "It's part of Saratoga originally, you know. And practically all of my friends and relatives seem to work here."
Until the late 1970's, the company was owned by a local family. The plant is on the same spot as the original plant, on Geyser Road across from the Saratoga Spa State Park. The building is crisply clean and painted periwinkle blue.
Water comes in through a series of pipes directly from the springs in the woods. The carbonation is removed and then replaced to make the bubbles uniform. After it is purified, the water is spurted into bottles of various sizes, which are capped, labeled and then dropped into cartons for shipping, mostly locally (its new owners want to market it as far away as Florida and California). The machines can bottle as many as 550 7.7-ounce bottles a minute.
 
Thanks for the Samples
 Since the company announced plans to reopen, many people here have expressed their delight. Mary Lou Whitney, the grande dame of Saratoga horse racing, who owns a summer home here, wrote a nice letter to Mr. Malatino thanking him for some free samples he had sent and offering to provide marketing advice. Aggie's, a clothing store on Broadway, decorated its front windows in Saratoga Mineral Water motif and got its employees to wear commemorative T-shirts.
"I cannot tell you how many people have come in here and said we're so glad to see them back, where is the water," said Mary Lou Mullaney, the store's owner. "People had been hoarding cases of it and siphoning it out one bottle a month, because they were afraid they'd never be able to get it again."
A. C. Dake, the Mayor, has been feeling downright celebratory. "This is a great confidence builder and it just makes people feel very glad," she said. At the event announcing the purchase of the company, she said, she joined other officials in guzzling Saratoga Mineral Water. "We were sitting around drinking it like it was Champagne," she said.

HEADLINE: Storage Technology Drops

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: LOUISVILLE, Colo., May 22

 BODY:
The Storage Technology Corporation stock fell today after the maker of computer data-storage products warned that its second-quarter results should be below the company's previous expectations.
While the company declined to estimate the exact amount, it said earnings were expected to be below the first-quarter result of 30 cents a share. 
 The company's shares fell $3.75 to close at $33.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Company officials said the company's performance was expected to improve through the end of the year, with overall earnings for the year in the same range as 1991.
The principal reason for the change in second-quarter earnings estimates, the company said, is continuing softness in orders for its 4400 Automated Cartridge System, a device that stores computer data on magnetic tapes.
The company also cited the recession, other competitive pressures and high overhead costs resulting from lower-than-expected manufacturing volumes.

HEADLINE: OPEC Sets Slight Rise In Its Output

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: VIENNA, May 22

 BODY:
OPEC struck a deal today to raise oil production only slightly during the peak-demand summer season, hoping to keep crude prices firm.
The oil minister of Libya, Abdallah Salim al-Badri, said the group reached the accord during a three-hour meeting. 
 Iraq's oil minister, Osama A. R. al-Hiti, said he had refused to sign the agreement because "the Saudis were dictating the positions" of other producers. Iraq, however, is not exporting oil because of a United Nations embargo imposed after its invasion of Kuwait nearly two years ago.
 
Exception for Kuwait
 The accord calls for all OPEC members but Kuwait to hold production at current levels in the July-September quarter. Kuwait was allowed an unlimited increase as its oil industry rapidly bounces back from the damages of the Persian Gulf war.
The deal would effectively set OPEC's production ceiling at about 23.4 million barrels a day -- around the level of current output.
Prices have been higher than expected this spring, but are still about $2.50 a barrel below OPEC's $21 target. A barrel is 42 gallons.
Analysts said the agreement probably would keep prices steady.
Paul Mlotok, head of energy research at Morgan Stanley in New York, said the deal would "probably lead to a balanced market," keeping supply and demand in line. Prices will probably stay "more or less around current levels," he said.
Prices had risen about 50 cents a barrel Thursday after the outline of the agreement filtered out. Prices had been down some because many industry people had expected a bigger increase in output.
 
Small Price Declines
 Prices today ended higher, with light crude oil for July delivery up 4 cents to $20.94 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Demand normally grows in the summer, the peak driving season. Moreover, the economic recovery in the United States is expected to lift sales of crude oil.
The current supply ceiling, set in February, restrained pumping to avoid a price collapse in the spring, when demand normally falls.
At that time, Iran complained that the production ceiling was too high; it expressed similar objections to the new accord.
The ministers met in the hotel suite of Youssef Omeir bin Youssef, the oil minister of the United Arab Emirates and the current president of OPEC.
Earlier, ministers gave sketchy details of the emerging accord.
 
Little Change Seen
 The oil minister of Iran, Gholam Reza Aghazadeh, said the proposed accord was "basically a rollover" of the current oil production ceiling. It appeared the plan would allow Saudi Arabia, the group's most powerful member, to continue pumping at a high level, which is estimated at about 8.1 million barrels a day at present.
United Nations and Iraqi officials have discussed a proposal that would allow Baghdad to sell oil to buy food and other humanitarian supplies. No progress has been reported recently.
OPEC's members are Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela.

HEADLINE: Treasury Issues Higher in Light Trading

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities rose in light trading yesterday, as some investors and traders stepped up and bought notes and bonds after two days of fairly sharp price declines.
Most of the gains were recorded during overnight trading in Asia and later in European financial markets. Analysts said participants in the United States seemed to be more interested in the start of a long holiday weekend than in taking on new positions. In preparation for the Memorial Day holiday, trading was suspended at 1 P.M. 
 Despite the price turnaround, analysts noted that the market remained defensive. Since the Federal Reserve Board apparently decided to keep short-term rates steady at least for now, traders have become mindful of the next round of economic reports, the analysts said. If the data due next week are stronger than expected, investors may begin to watch for the possibility of a Fed move might be to tighten policy, they said. "The market still seems a bit suspect," said William V. Sullivan Jr., a senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds. "It would take some really weak data to get rates to move back toward their lows."
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 29 1/2-year bonds of 2021 were offered at the close of trading at a price of 1022/32 , up half a point, to yield 7.82 percent, compared with 7.86 percent late Thursday and 7.81 percent on May 15.
Among outstanding Treasury note issues, the 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 101 1/8, up 9/32 , to yield 7.33 percent.
Prices of new Treasury notes auctioned earlier this week also recovered.
The 5 1/8 percent two-year notes sold Wednesday were offered in when-issued trading yesterday at a price to yield 5.24 percent, compared with 5.30 percent late Thursday. And the 6 3/4 percent five-year notes auctioned on Thursday were offered on a when-issued basis yesterday at a price to yield 6.69 percent. They were auctioned on Thursday to yield 6.75 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates were unchanged to down slightly.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 3.67 percent late yesterday, unchanged from Thursday. Six-month bill rates fell by 1 basis point, or one-hundredth of a percentage point, to a late rate of 3.77 percent. And one-year bill rates fell by 6 basis points, to a late rate of 3.98 percent.
No new corporate or tax-exempt municipal bonds were priced yesterday, and trading in the secondary markets for investment-grade corporate and municipal bond markets was extremely slow.
Traders said that prices of most outstanding corporate issues were essentially unchanged.
And participants in the tax-exempt municipal bond market said that prices of most widely quoted securities were unchanged to up an eighth of a point.

Dollar Turns Mixed in U.S. In Light Day as Gold Rises

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar turned mixed in domestic dealings yesterday after gaining ground overseas. Trading was light.
Gold prices advanced after falling in Asia. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $337.90 a troy ounce, up 90 cents from Thursday. The Republic National Bank said gold rose 75 cents an ounce to a late bid price of $337.75. 
 Analysts said the dollar posted some gains on the belief that the Federal Reserve was holding monetary policy steady, which would rule out a much anticipated cut in interest rates. Lower interest rates make dollar-denominated securities less valuable.
"There has been a lot of dollar weakness predicated on a Fed ease and widening interest-rate differentials in Europe," said Michael Malpede, an analyst with Refco Inc. in Chicago.
He said most traders were preoccupied with adjusting their holdings ahead of the long Memorial Day weekend.
 
New Data Next Week
 Other currencies -- particularly the Japanese yen and the German mark -- appeared to dominate trading. United States dealers are looking to the release next week of fresh economic data, including April durable goods orders and weekly jobless claims, to offer some direction to trading.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 129.65 Japanese yen, from 129.61 yen on Thursday. Later in London, it fell to 129.40 yen. In New York the dollar settled at 129.20 yen, down from 130.35 yen on Thursday.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.8155, from $1.8170 late Thursday. In New York it cost $1.8160 to buy one pound, less expensive than Thursday's $1.8165.

HEADLINE: The End of Sovereignty

BYLINE: By Flora Lewis; Flora Lewis is Senior Columnist of The New York Times.

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
Europe is experiencing severe growing pains. All 12 members of the European Community must ratify the Treaty of Maastricht, agreed upon by government heads in the Netherlands in December, if European unity is to be achieved. The debates are stormier than expected.
Critics in each country have their own sticking points, plus domestic political feuds that complicate the issue. But the storms should have been expected because matters of nation and sovereignty are being broached directly as never before. 
 Fundamentally, all members have to face the question of whether democracy and the free market economy are compatible. Both are being urged on ex-Communist and developing countries as the essential double helix of successful societies, necessarily intertwined. The paradox is that advanced states are finding it hard to keep them together as they accept the facts of interdependence.
This is true everywhere, including in the U.S., but Europe must be first to tackle it.
Sovereignty is a matter of frontiers, and democracy is anchored in politically defined territory. But, as Britain's former Foreign Secretary, Sir Geoffrey Howe, has said, "Sovereignty isn't like virginity." There are degrees of sovereignty, and the modern world is eroding the notion of absolute and exclusive nation-states.
The market disrespects sovereign borders as much and wherever it can. The global economy has swollen to a fluid mass that no government can regulate on its own, yet it affects the everyday life of ordinary citizens more and more directly. Jobs, interest rates, the value of money are matters each government talks about to its electorate, but the people are touched by decisions beyond their leaders' control.
Instant, 24-hour access to stock markets around the world, vast international banking entanglements that can confound national monitors as the Bank of Credit and Commerce International did, make a mockery of sovereignty. Likewise the real estate giant Olympia and York, whose properties can't be foreclosed to pay debt like those of lesser operators would be because that would drive down real estate values in too many countries and threaten too many banks.
Some Europeans, like Margaret Thatcher, oppose letting European union nibble away at sovereign command within national borders because they consider Brussels likely to reintroduce socialistic tendencies. Some agree with France's former Defense Minister, Jean-Pierre Chevenement, a socialist, who says it would expose his countrymen to the "power of international money" regardless of their votes.
Jacques Attali, the puckish Frenchman who heads the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, says that the market needs to overcome borders while traditional democracy needs to keep them. So the aim for the future, he argues, must be a "democracy without frontiers," a superior democracy of overlapping units, where everyone can be a member of a variety of democratic entities of various shapes and sizes.
These are difficult, challenging ideas, and the future citizens of the European Union are stumbling into them as they debate the new treaty. The choice is stark: Europe, yes or no. France, a key founder of the Common Market, is raging with doubt, though most people see there is no going back. The democracy dilemma will have to be addressed with new, transnational countervailing forces, growing out of the growing pains.
This is the way the world is going. Yugoslavia shows what the opposite direction means. The European Community has to lead in defining the issues of sovereignty, economy and democracy. Others won't escape it.

BYLINE: By Bernard Holland

 BODY:

Janice Weber
Pianist
Steinway Hall 
 Midway through her piano recital at Steinway Hall on Thursday night, Janice Weber spoke of opera transcriptions as educational tools for the media-bereft audiences of the 19th century: a kernel of truth in that but much to argue about. Four-hand duets, simple arrangements for the modest pianist, yes, but what Ms. Weber proceeded to play -- a late Liszt setting from "Die Meistersinger," Busoni's "chamber" transcription of themes from "Carmen" and an Abram Chasins inflation of hit tunes from Weinberger's "Schwanda, the Bagpiper" -- seemed less an educational service for others than significant self-serving by the pianist-composers who wrote them.
Familiar operatic material exists in all three, but it is swamped with notes, thousands of them. Around Wagner's aria "Am stillen Herd" rippled waves of scales and arpeggios. Busoni, a serious thinker who nevertheless seemed helpless before the lure of virtuoso extravaganza, set Ms. Weber severe problems here, at the same time making interesting observations on Bizet's already interesting harmony. The "Schwanda" transcription was the weakest of the three musically: a pretty tune wrapped in bombast.
Pieces like this, of course, tempt pianists like Ms. Weber. She can handle their complications with firmness and confidence; and where there is music worth exposing and organizing, she finds and projects it very clearly. Ms. Weber continued her underlying theme of driven virtuosity with Leo Ornstein's Fourth Piano Sonata. Its relentless difficulties begin with the French and Russian colorists of the early 20th century and then congeal them into thick blocks of busy, powerful movement. Mr. Ornstein, as Ms. Weber reminded us, is alive and well at age 100 and living near Green Bay, Wis.
The program began with the two Beethoven Sonatas of Opus 27: the E-flat major and the familiar "Moonlight."

'American Dream' Charts Labor's Loss

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS; Sam Roberts covers politics and labor for The New York Times.

 BODY:
When Florence Reece wrote the labor anthem "Which Side Are You On" back in the 1930's, her question was rhetorical. Four decades later, when she sang it in Barbara Kopple's paean to labor, "Harlan County, U.S.A.," the song title was still listed in the credits without a question mark.
But by the mid-1980's, when Ms. Kopple filmed "American Dream," about a protracted meatpackers strike against Hormel, the nation had grown more ambivalent about organized labor. Few union leaders would risk asking such a sweeping question of the public -- or even of their own members. 
 A very different song punctuates "American Dream," the 1990 film for which the director won an Academy Award. Twice during the movie, which opened in March and is playing at the Quad Cinema in Greenwich Village, a union leader named Jim Guyette loosely invokes the lyrics of "No Surrender," Bruce Springsteen's rock ballad of rebellion. In the end, Mr. Guyette lives the lyrics: he neither retreats nor surrenders. But he and the militant meatpackers' union local he headed are defeated nonetheless.
In most film versions of labor strife, from "On the Waterfront" in 1954 to "Newsies" earlier this year, heroes and villains are easy to identify. Fiction has that advantage: people and controversies can be defined starkly, without ambiguity. Few filmgoers left Martin Ritt's "Norma Rae" (1979) or John Sayles's "Matewan" (1987) cheering for management. Even Ms. Kopple's "Harlan County, U.S.A." (1977), which also won an Academy Award, generally championed the Kentucky coal miners.
But "American Dream" is a labor nightmare from real life. A reflection of the times, it offers more questions than answers through a largely nonjudgmental account of Mr. Guyette's inspiring crusade against both the management of George A. Hormel & Company and the curiously pragmatic leadership of his own international union.
The film tells the story of the yearlong strike precipitated in 1985 after the company unilaterally cut hourly wages from $10.69 to $8.25 at its Austin, Minn., plant. The walkout finally ended when the company reopened the plant with permanent replacement workers. The international union seized control of the local and negotiated a new contract that guaranteed the strikers only a place on a waiting list -- at lower pay.
As "American Dream" makes clear, the dispute at Hormel went beyond wages and working conditions. It also involved a breach between a defiant local and a remote leadership in Washington that was more than willing to urge concessions on the part of higher-paid employees to spare workers at the lower end of the pay scale.
Ms. Kopple's account could not have captured raw emotion any better if the dialogue had been scripted and the characters professionally cast. But, at times, her eyewitness camera blinks: specific details about internal union politics take second place to the human drama that pits brother against brother -- in one case literally -- in a debate over principle versus survival. Workers at Hormel were also worried about on-the-job injury rates, an issue ignored by the film. Hormel was profitable but, some analysts suggested, it stood in a precarious position in a changing industry -- another topic the movie doesn't explore.
Ms. Kopple insists that "American Dream" is not agitprop but rather a tale of people fighting to preserve a value system that began to erode when worker loyalty was rewarded not with a raise but with a pay cut.
In a recent interview Ms. Kopple said she was inspired by "Salt of the Earth," the 1954 fact-based portrayal of striking miners in New Mexico. One measure of organized labor's progress since then is that while distribution of "Salt of the Earth" was initially blocked by the motion picture industry, both of Ms. Kopple's films won Oscars.
From the very beginning, "American Dream" suggests that times have changed. The film opens with reminders of the Reagan Administration's attacks on organized labor and gritty images of hogs being led to slaughter -- a metaphorical foreshadowing of the fate of hundreds of members of Local P-9 of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, the striking union at Hormel.
Hormel had been an industry pioneer in guaranteeing annual wages and offering a profit-sharing plan and had operated its Austin plant for 52 years without a strike. For these reasons, workers there seemed particularly hurt by the company's demand for wage concessions -- concessions that jeopardized their ability to fulfill their modest version of the American Dream.
In the film, grown men weep because they can no longer be breadwinners. The union hall is transformed into a social institution where members, united in desperation and self-rightousness, pool their financial and professional resources. It is a spirit born of a small town and of a proud heritage, a vitality that evokes the collective agony of "The Grapes of Wrath" and the leadership of labor icons like John L. Lewis. It is rare to find such energy displayed by unions today.
Miscalculations on the part of organized labor contributed to a climate in which President Reagan could crush the air traffic controllers' union after an illegal strike in 1981. This climate, combined with the consolidation of American industry and an increasingly troubled economy, has led many unions to scale down their agendas: job guarantees and better health benefits have become higher priorities; wage increases have been linked to improved productivity. Last month, the mere threat of hiring replacement workers brought an end to a strike at Caterpillar Inc. in Peoria, Ill.
Predictably, union activism is on the decline. Although a strike threat is often a more potent weapon than an actual walkout, strikes nevertheless represent one test of union resolve. Federal labor officials recorded 40 last year, fewer than one-tenth of the peak four decades ago. Today, about one in six members of America's workforce belongs to a union, compared to more than a third of the workforce back then.
Given the troubled state of labor and the economy, it may be no surprise that the situation at Hormel turned so messy. The rift between the Hormel local and the international union deepened when Mr. Guyette recruited Ray Rogers, a labor consultant whose New York-based Corporate Campaign Inc. had helped pressure the J. P. Stevens Company to sign its first union contract in 1980. Mr. Rogers's strategy is to transform negotiations into political campaigns that risk leaving reticent labor leaders far behind their rank-and-file. Mr. Rogers was arrested twice for advising the strikers.
With the strike by 1,500 workers in its 20th week, Hormel reopened the Austin plant. After 10 days, 75 striking workers returned, and hundreds of replacement workers were hired. Months later, the international seized control of the local and signed a contract under which the base wage rose to $10.70 by the third year -- one cent more than the company had been paying before the strike.
Not long after the settlement, Hormel leased the Austin plant's slaughterhouse operations to a company that offered a $6.50 hourly wage. Of nearly 500 strikers on a waiting list, Hormel says that all 292 who chose to return have been rehired at Austin, where the base wage is now $11.15.
Would P-9 have won with the international's support? Maybe not. But without it the local was doomed. "What the leadership did to undermine P-9 affected every major fight from Eastern to The Daily News to Caterpillar," Mr. Rogers said in a recent interview.
In "Salt of the Earth," a miner's wife declares: "I don't want to go down fighting. I want to win." By contrast, "American Dream" is pervaded by a sense of futility, albeit one that Ms. Kopple maintains was unintentional. She agrees that the strike galvanized the community and brought workers together as nothing had before. Still, its legacy is decidedly mixed.
The law under which Mr. Rogers was arrested has since been voided. Minnesota passed a ban on hiring permanent replacement workers. Mr. Guyette moved to New York, where he is chief organizer for a municipal employees' union. A woman who left town with her family while her father remained on the picket line -- "We're not abandoning him," she says in the film. "We're just taking our fight someplace else." -- has returned to Austin. Two brothers, R. J. and Ron Bergstrom, were pitted against each other by the strike -- "He won't be my brother if he crosses the line," R. J. says of Ron. But they began speaking to each other again when R. J. asked Ron to teach his daughter softball.
But bitterness lingers. So does a sense of betrayal, ambivalence about whom to blame and frustration over having the American Dream redefined by forces from afar.
"You can't win every fight, and that doesn't mean you've lost," Ms. Kopple maintains. Indeed, as a showing of her film ended the other day at the Quad Cinema, an angry young man yelled, "Boycott Hormel!" -- an empty gesture, perhaps, since the fight against Hormel is long over.
In the book "No Retreat, No Surrender," a study of the Austin strike, Dave Hage and Paul Klauda quote a former official of the international union as saying this about a failed negotiating session: "We were sleeping with the same whore, but we were having different dreams." For organized labor, Ms. Kopple's film suggests a rude awakening from the American Dream rather than its realization.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
Motels Turn Their Attention to Security

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE

 BODY:
SPURRED partly by well-publicized negligence settlements against Motel 6 in the last year, safety gets increased attention in motels these days. When I stayed in a Holiday Inn last month in Columbia, Mo., I got a plastic card with a magnetic strip -- like the ones in high-priced downtown hotels -- to open an electronic lock on my room door, instead of the metal key for a tumbler lock. Increasingly these electronic locks, which may cost $250 to install, are found in budget places. The reason is that a metal key often has a room number on it and is easy for a criminal to copy or keep for theft later. A Holiday Inn spokeswoman said that the organization "highly recommended" that hotels convert to the key card when they modernized, and that key card systems were required for all its new buildings. Because franchise holders are not required to report on this recommendation, the organization does not know how many have converted.
 
Lock Systems Crucial
 A motel's system for locks is crucial to guest security. Ray Ellis, head of risk management for the American Hotel and Motel Association, estimates that break-ins are reduced 75 to 80 percent when electronic locks are used. 
 Mr. Ellis of the association cited the actions of some big chains on the concerns. One, the Budgetel chain, is shifting to a key card system over three years for its 89 motels in 23 states in the Eastern half of the country and is halfway through this $3 million project, according to Dale Nichols, vice president of marketing.
The Motel 6 chain has undertaken an $8 million overhaul of its security in 668 motels, retraining all the employees in the process, although it is not shifting from metal keys. The Super 8 chain, with 890 motels, also keeping its metal keys, is instituting tighter key inventory, requiring that a motel replace the lock if a key is missing and redo the entire motel if a master key disappears.
Part of the increase in security consciousness involves the increasing number of women traveling by themselves: industry research shows that 39 percent of business travelers last year were women; in 1970, the figure was 1 percent.
Another factor is the economic pinch, which causes travelers to pick less expensive places. And, in the words of Robert C. Hazard Jr., chairman of Choice Hotels, a group that encompasses several budget chains, including Sleep Inns in the $35 or $36 bracket. "As the price of the room goes down, the guest's concern for safety and security goes up."
 
Negligence Suits
 A more abrupt spur to nationwide assessment of motel security was a pair of negligence lawsuits against Motel 6 that brought big damage payments. One suit, by a woman who was raped and robbed of her photographic equipment at a motel operated by the chain in Fort Worth brought a settlement worth $10 million last June. The other suit, also involving rape, was settled in March, but this agreement specified that the details of the case would not be made public.
Last summer, after the first settlement, The Wall Street Journal carried an article on the issue of security at budget motels, with copious quotes from witnesses at the trial. The negative publicity led to a closed meeting of many motel-chain officers at the American Hotel and Motel Association, setting off the current cycle of reassessment and change. "We've always been very security conscious," said Mr. Nichols of Budgetel, "but when something like that happens, everybody runs back quick to look at what they're doing."
Anthony Marshall, dean of the School of Hospitality Management at Florida International University in Miami, said heightened concerns should affect hotels and motels at all price levels since, in his experience, neither high price nor brand name was a foolproof guarantee security.
Motel 6, which operates all its 568 motels rather than franchising, has spent six months assessing its security rules. Five years ago, it embarked on installation of deadbolts and peepholes. After the reassessment, according to Hugh Thrasher, executive vice president, the chain went to work to meet the "new expectations" of the public on security.
The Motel 6 identification and numbers have been taken off room keys, in favor of a code and it is now required that a new cylinder be installed if a key is lost. Lighting in parking lots has been surveyed and the chain now requires a certain level of brightness in the dimmest part of the lot. The chain has codified the duties of security guards, where they are employed, and has provided two-way radios to every motel to connect with security guards.
Under a new policy, guests under 18 years of age are no longer allowed to register, and some identification, like a credit card, is required for everyone even though 60 percent of Motel 6 guests pay cash. Mr. Thrasher said he expected that since everyone would be "carded," no one would feel discriminated against, and would welcome the added measure of security. The chain has also put up for sale, and does not advertise, six old downtown motels that are on bypassed highways because they no longer serve a traveling public. The two negligence cases did not involve any of these six, according to the company. Maintaining these security changes and paying higher insurance premiums and wages for additional personnel are expected to cost Motel 6 $3 million a year. Motel 6 charges $24.95 for a single in most places.
 
Credit Card as Key
 The 19 Sleep Inns, all new, have a sophisticated key system: the customer's credit card opens the door to the motel and to the room, creating a record for the office of all the times the door is opened.
Like Motel 6, many motels continue to use metal keys because of the high cost of card systems. But all of them are also tightening up on key control because, as Mr. Ellis points out, if there is a security negligence suit at a motel with a key and knob lock, the motel is going to lose. "For a while," he said, "when I looked at the database, I thought that security problems were stabilizing, but then we realized it was an artificial indication because motels that still used keys were settling privately, before court, in assault cases." He said that in 1962 only one suit based on a break-in cost a company more than $1 million. In 1986, for example, 500 suits cost more than $1 million.
Microtel, a chain with seven motels in New York, Ohio and Kentucky, has made security one of its big selling points although it uses metal keys. All doors into the hallway are locked 24 hours a day, except for the one that passes the desk. The outside doors open with the room key. If a key disappears, the lock is replaced. This is carried out by on-site managers, and no locksmith need be called, according to a spokesman.
 
 
New Candor
 Both Motel 6 and Budgetel have prepared "security tip" sheets to be placed in each room, and they have also sought publicity for projects to enhance security.
This candor about a sensitive topic represents a turnaround that will help travelers in the long run because they will be aware of what they should get. For example, motels without door peepholes are unsafe because locks are to no avail if a guest opens the door in ignorance. A room phone is a good defense from intruders and disturbances in the hall, but it should be tested to be sure it works. A deadbolt is essential, and a metal flip loop on a solid door is better than a chain on a hollow door.
But Mr. Ellis of the motel association reported that most smaller motels were reluctant to give guests printed information about fire safety or checking out room security lest the guests fear they were in an unsafe place. To meet this problem, the association itself will take the onus and is preparing a safety sheet, closely modeled on the Motel 6 version, to be used by all member companies. The sheet should be distributed by June or July.

Here's One Loser People Really Look Up To

BYLINE: By Richard Sandomir

 BODY:
Meet George Costanza, Lord of the Losers and Jerry Seinfeld's best friend on NBC's "Seinfeld."
Behold his self-esteem: "No one's a bigger idiot than me." 
 . . . his philosophy of power: "Once in my life, I'd like the upper hand. I have no hand. No hand at all. How do I get the hand?"
. . . his sexual naivete: "Lesbian wedding. How do they work out the bride and groom on that? What do they do, flip a coin?"
. . . his paternal instincts: "I'd like to have a kid. Of course, you've got to have a date first."
George Costanza is situation comedy's Job, for whom life is one continuous push into a steaming bowl of soup. He is so incompetent he can't move cars from one side of the street to the other without a crash. His social acumen is such that he wears a wedding band to entice single women. His paranormal abilities foretold only that he would be bald.
George may be a loser, but "Seinfeld" is not. Last week, NBC announced that the quirky sitcom will keep its Wednesday slot (at 9 P.M.) on the fall schedule. The show has a distinctly urban appeal, striking a chord with those who empathize with four New Yorkers muddling their way through inanities of urban life. "Seinfeld" has proved popular with a hip audience of 18- to-34-year-olds (it ranked 20th with this age group in the ratings). NBC has run two episodes back-to-back on several occasions. And, to give "Seinfeld" a head start this fall, the program's new season will begin in August after Olympics coverage is over. (In the meantime summer reruns will resume June 24.)
The show's popularity has elevated Jerry Seinfeld to the top echelon of comedians. He recently took his act to Carnegie Hall and to the Kennedy Center in Washington, and he was host of NBC's "Saturday Night Live" and appeared on the cover of GQ magazine.
But his sitcom friend George, who is played by Jason Alexander, is on no such path. What is there to say about a short, chunky, jobless misfit in his 30's with dinosaur sheets on his bed who gets arrested for urinating in a shopping mall garage and who wonders why baseball teams don't get wiped out in plane crashes?
George is not merely a sitcom loser or simply a quantum leap beyond other TV unfortunates like Barney Fife of "The Andy Griffith Show," Mel Cooley of "The Dick Van Dyke Show" or Cliff Clavin of "Cheers." He is the shlimazl who stirs the "Seinfeld" drink, the downtrodden super neurotic who suffers the worst misfortunes of the show's four single, fretful characters.
"George is the catalyst for the shenanigans," said Mr. Alexander, who won a Tony Award in 1989 for his performance in "Jerome Robbins's Broadway." "He puts himself out there more than the other characters. George's fatal flaw is that he tries to be everything for everyone and always winds up spreading himself too thin, and that's when he gets his head cut off. It's not a terrible trait, just a tragic flaw. But I don't see him as a loser."
Because George is the show's hod carrier of angst, he is the easiest character to identify with. Seinfeld, as himself, is a too-neat, too-successful comic in pressed jeans who is lucky enough to have his car stolen and returned Simonized with the wheels aligned. Kramer, Seinfeld's next-door neighbor with the Erasherhead hairdo, is too bizarre and mysterious to be a central character. Elaine, Seinfeld's ex-girlfriend, is a one-of-the-guys woman who has her neuroses but too often is too normal.
Informal conversations with "Seinfeld" watchers confirm that they feel a kinship with George -- even if they don't want to publicly admit it. Said Bart D., a young advertising copywriter: "When George was set up on a blind date by Jerry and Elaine and said in his first phone conversation with her things went so well that he threw away his notes, I said, 'Whoa! Somebody else does this?' "
Ralph O., a housewares salesman, also closely identifies with Costanza, the only palpable difference between the two being Ralph's successful career. Costanza has no career. One job as a reader in a publishing house ended when he had sex with a cleaning woman on his desk. Seinfeld calls him Biff Loman, after Willy Loman's unsuccessful son in "Death of a Salesman."
"A lot of people tell me I look like George," said Ralph. "What's close to me is being bald, short and never getting the girl. But I like that he's always scrapping and battling. He always loses. Please, God, make my results different."
What saves George from becoming a one-note shlep are little signs of opportunism and clever thought, as well as a core of basic goodness. He is a loyal friend who tries (not as hard as he could) to get a girlfriend and job and might succeed if only he didn't sleep 18 hours a day. And while he is a magnet for others' cruelties, he can't return fire. Mr. Alexander said that when the show's writers tried to make George too tough, audience reaction forced them to retreat.
"I make him someone who can laugh at his own foibles when he's in the thick of his troubles," said Mr. Alexander. "What makes him appealing is that he has a strong female side. Lots of his anxieties are feminine: How do I look? What impression do I make? Am I prepared?"
Mr. Alexander envies George, who was fashioned out of the life of Larry David, co-creator of "Seinfeld." "I envy that he states his opinions so firmly," the actor said. "George is not an equivocator. I can be. He may do an about-face, but it's as thorough as his first attempt."
For example, he tries to qualify for unemployment benefits by saying he was interviewed for a job by a fictitious latex maker. When that ploy fails, he offers to date his unemployment clerk's unattractive daughter. When she dumps him, he vows to bring Keith Hernandez, the former New York Met who befriended Seinfeld, to meet the clerk. Of course, that ploy fails, too.
While George's shlimazlhood may be secretly admired, it has not led to an outward display of affection for Mr. Alexander's portrayal. He said he gets perhaps 20 letters a month.
"The people who watch us tend to be very cool," he said. "They'll come over and say a line from a show. One time George was mistaken for another character on the show, a neo-Nazi. Someone yelled, 'Hey, O'Brien, you Nazi S.O.B.!' It's nice to be noticed, but I wondered what other people there who hadn't seen the show thought."

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE VIEW;
Some Welcome Fiddling With Landmarks

BYLINE: By Paul Goldberger

 BODY:
Two proposals to change the face of New York saw the light of day in the last couple of weeks, and they may or may not have something to do with each other. No, strike that. Actually, they have quite a bit to do with each other. Each plan is about giving the public what it wants, and about the realization by people in authority that what the public wants in architecture is not always what it has been given. And each in its own way holds out no small degree of hope for this beleaguered city.
The more striking of the two proposals -- and the one that seems almost too good to be true -- is the suggestion floated by Amtrak officials that the railroad abandon the present Penn Station, that wretched thing undeserving of the noble name it bears, and build a new train station within the shell of the old Post Office across Eighth Avenue, due to be largely vacated in 1993. Amtrak's spokesman even talked of the "marketability of architecture" as an aid to train travel. 
 Could this really happen? Did we ever think that the day would come when a railroad would admit that the quality of a train station might have some connection with the public's willingness to travel on trains? And that Amtrak might take it upon itself to liberate us from that ghastly place that combines the elegance of a subway station with the charm of an airport?
Pinch me, please; I'm obviously having an architectural dream. Such things don't happen, certainly not in New York. The demolition of Penn Station in the early 1960's was the greatest single act of architectural vandalism New York has ever seen -- the unconscionable destruction of one of the noblest buildings in American history. Designed by McKim, Mead & White, the old Pennsylvania Station was at once a stirring gateway to the city and an utterly brilliant work of engineering and urban planning. The same architects designed the post office across the street as a companion piece to the classical station, so there is poetic justice to this plan to place a new station behind the great colonnade of the post office: history's cruel slight to McKim, Mead & White reversed.
A lot could go wrong, of course. Amtrak could be unable to come up with the $100 million needed to turn the post office into a workable station (the tracks are already under it, making access easy; the problem is reworking the interior spaces). The design could turn out to be awful. But in a period of such miracles as Donald Trump's abandonment of his Trump City scheme and the United States Supreme Court's decision to let stand the prohibition against erecting a skyscraper beside St. Bartholomew's Church on Park Avenue, I would prefer to think in terms of the glory of the possible.
If the Penn Station proposal would fiddle with one landmark to evoke another, the Sony Corporation's plan for the A.T.& T. building on Madison Avenue fiddles with a landmark to bring it closer to its ideal self. At least that's the goal of this scheme, which would dramatically change the way the public perceives this tower, which fills the block front between 55th and 56th Streets.
A quick bit of history. The pediment-topped A.T.& T. Building -- celebrated or notorious, depending on your point of view, as the "Chippendale skycraper" -- was designed by Philip Johnson and John Burgee in 1978. Surely New York's most widely known ex-
ample of post-modern architecture, it has been far more effective as a piece of architectural proselytizing than as headquarters for the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, which was broken up by Government decree before the building was finished in 1984.
Company executives made no secret of the fact that they found the structure's haughty classicism at odds with the new, high-tech image they sought for the post-breakup A.T.& T. But they held on to the building until last year, when they leased it to Sony USA, a corporation not without a high-tech image of its own -- but with an even more determined eagerness to house itself in a structure with a high architectural profile.
For all its significance as the first important post-modern corporate skyscraper, the A.T.& T. Building has always been more successful as a symbol than as an actual building. The problem is less the building's bizarre top, which is dowdy at worst, than its heavy-handed bottom, which aspires to monumental civic grandeur but doesn't really work. When the design was announced, the public space around the base -- set within open, 60-foot-high, vaulted arcades with columns of pink granite -- seemed just the thing for a city crying out for a nobler public realm. But once built, these spaces turned out to be noisy, windy and dark. Their elegance was too self-conscious to offset the cold formality that pervades the building; the grandiose architecture rolls over the space and quashes it.
No wonder usage of this public space has been sparse, and most people in this neighborhood with a few moments to spare have ended up in the glass-enclosed atrium of the I.B.M. Building next door instead. Sony, determined both to put its own mark on the building and to fix what was broken, hired the architects Charles Gwathmey and Robert Siegel to renovate the structure. They in turn enlisted Philip Johnson as a consultant, to give the project the proper pedigree. The three architects produced a scheme whereby the open arcades would be enclosed in glass and turned into elegant Madison Avenue shops. To make up for some of the loss of public space, the secondary public space in the building, the block-long glass-roofed arcade behind the tower, would be upgraded and expanded.
From a purely esthetic point of view, the design -- which will require the approval of the City Planning Commission -- is unquestionably an improvement. The tall openings in the Madison Avenue facade would not be changed but would be filled in with windows of a design consistent with those used elsewhere in the building. Functionally, the plan makes sense, too: a solid facade with storefronts is better on Madison Avenue than the present open facade broken up by columns. And public space belongs off the avenue, in the glass-roofed arcade, which even now is a far more successful space than the one in front.
But although the proposal would serve the public better in actuality, as a symbol it is more than a bit disquieting. If we measure by square footage, the public is forfeiting open space to private retail uses. But are we really losing overall? Somewhere there are people who like the A.T.& T. space as it is, but I doubt there are many. I would trade 18,947 feet of fair-to-middling space, which is what the building now has, for 10,220 feet of inviting and usable space any day. And if this important work of architecture ends up with an improved look in the bargain, so much the better.

HEADLINE: For Troubled Co-ops, the Workout Rx

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY

 BODY:
THREE years after sponsor defaults began undermining the financial health of hundreds of New York City's converted co-ops and condominiums, the pace of new defaults has slowed considerably and many troubled buildings are working their way back to stability.
Last June, the New York State Attorney General's office said that sponsors had defaulted on maintenance payments and carrying charges in about 400 co-ops and condominiums, or about 10 percent of the 4,000 buildings converted since 1980. A year later, the number of troubled buildings remains at 400. 
 "We are still seeing sponsors default," said Frederick K. Mehlman, the deputy attorney general who as of May 15 resigned as head of the Real Estate Financing Bureau, which enforces the conversion laws. "But at the same time the number of troubled buildings is being balanced out by buildings where successful workouts have taken them off our list. There will still be some co-ops that will fail, but the worst may be behind us."
Nevertheless, the turn in the tide on sponsor defaults has left a legacy of difficulties that is likely to persist for several years. Most mortgage lenders continue to refuse to renew underlying mortgages or to make loans to apartment buyers in buildings where sponsors have defaulted or where they still own a majority of the apartments.
Board members describe desperate last-minute searches for refinancing when their buildings' loans are due and budget cuts that force them to reduce staffs and delay necessary repairs. Banks' reluctance to make new loans means that apartment owners who bought into conversions and now want to sell cannot move and retrieve their investments even when they find willing buyers.
YET the worst nightmare that haunted owners in troubled buildings, a possible replay of the widespread co-op failures of the 1930's, has not occured and seems increasingly unlikely. Only two small buildings have been seized by lenders and converted back into rentals, with apartment buyers losing their investments.
One reason the picture is improving, Mr. Mehlman said, is that financial-disclosure statements required of most sponsors by his office allow the agency to identify potential problems earlier. Another is the willingness of lenders, sponsors and boards to come to the table for workouts.
"It is a relief to have moved beyond the cloud we were under," said Peggy Segal, president of a group that represented most of the shareholders in a co-op at 114 East 84th Street that negotiated a deal with the defaulting sponsor of its conversion plan. "We are now in better shape than ever before."
The corporation took back 17 sponsor-owned units in exchange for forgiving more than $250,000 in maintenance arrears. Last month, the nine apartments not sold to their occupants or other shareholders were auctioned at prices that ranged from an average of $27,000 for the occupied units to $321,000 for a seven-room apartment that will be delivered vacant.
Paulette Bonanno, vice president of the National Cooperative Bank, said the policies of her institution, like those of other mortgage lenders that do not keep loans on their own books but sell them on the secondary market, are largely dictated by the requirements of the second-market buyers.
"The risk issue for lenders is tied directly to sponsor involvement," said Ms. Bonanno. "Reducing risks of the lender, by reducing investor participation, is critical for these buildings."
The National Cooperative Bank, which offers only underlying co-op mortgages in New York City, will not write mortgages for buildings in which more than 30 to 35 of percent of shares are held by the sponsors or investors.
Mark T. Simpson, director of mortgage underwriting standards for the Federal National Mortgage Association, a major second market buyer, said its lending policy on individual co-op loans requires that 80 percent of the shares in a co-op be owned by resident shareholders.
"We will grant variances in some cases," he said. "The key is that projects with rent-regulated tenants cannot depend on subsidies from sponsors, but must be buildings where the maintenance is covered by the rents."
Maryann Rothman, executive director of the Council of New York Cooperatives, who has met with some lenders to discuss the situation, is hopeful that they will become more flexible in their judgment of which buildings qualify for loans.
"Eventually, there will have to be some give," said Ms. Rothman. "I think we will see lenders that will be willing to distinguish between buildings that are sound but have a high percentage of sponsor-owned apartments, and the few that are not so healthy. It is in their best interest to find ways to make the distinction."
Meanwhile, the conversion of rental buildings into co-ops or condominiums has slowed dramatically. According to the Attorney General's office, the peak year for conversions was 1987, when the office accepted 556 co-op and condominium plans for filing. Last year the number dropped to 127 and so far this year 23 plans have been submitted, but none has been declared effective.
The vast majority of converted co-ops and condominiums, Mr. Mehlman said, remain sound investments. And he characterized as "questionable" the plans filed for the two failed conversions that have reverted to rentals. Those plans never should have taken effect, he said.
The Depression years saw scores of co-ops, including some on Park and Fifth Avenues and Sutton Place, converted to rental buildings after shareholders, unable to support operating losses, walked away from their investments.
Until 1989, the possibility of sponsor defaults caused little concern for lenders or buyers in the market for converted apartments. The notion of defaults was almost unheard of, even in buildings where sponsors kept a high percentage of the shares. As long as sales were strong, most sponsors could count on profits from those transactions to cover the gap between what rent-regulated tenants paid in rent and the maintenance payments due on their unsold apartments.
But seams in the system -- which permit the conversion of a building with as few as 15 percent of the units sold -- began to show when the demand for converted apartments dropped sharply in 1987 and 1988. With the stream of income from sales dried up, some sponsors fell into arrears. A broad crisis emerged as more and more buildings had to struggle to cover their bills with reduced income from maintenance fees.
In response to the situation, Attorney General Robert Abrams imposed new financial-disclosure rules on co-ops and condominiums early in 1990. All builders and sponsors holding more than 10 percent of the shares in their co-ops or condominiums were required to file annual reports providing details of their ownership positions and financial status.
Scrutiny of the disclosure documents showed most sponsors were overly optimistic in their projections of sales and were victims of the recession and the downturn in the real estate market. In some cases, evidence of fraud emerged.
Last month, the Attorney General's office brought its first criminal case against a defaulted sponsor, Vlas Stevens of Mount Vernon, who was charged with grand larceny and real estate fraud. The complaint asserts he willfully jeopardized the investments of the residents of Hudson View Estates in Yonkers, "looted" the building's reserve fund and collected enough in rents to cover his maintenance payments but did not make them.
Mr. Stevens's attorney, Stanley N. Kutcher, said his client pleaded not guilty. "This is not a criminal matter," said Mr. Kutcher, "but a real estate deal that went bad."
MR. MEHLMAN, who left for private law practice after heading the Real Estate Financing Bureau since 1985, said there will be more criminal cases against defaulted sponsors. His successor is Gary R. Connor, bureau chief for enforcement and litigation since 1984.
The Attorney General's office has a civil case pending against the Resolution Trust Corporation -- the Federal savings-and-loan bailout agency -- about the rights of rent-regulated tenants in buildings now in its hands. Seeking to sell unsold units in buildings it had taken as a result of bank failures, the R.T.C. tried to evict their occupants. The Attorney General has challenged those evictions as violations of the state's rent-regulation law.
The initial case concerned eight apartments in a building on East 57th Street in Manhattan. But the potential impact of the decision is broader now that more bank and thrift failures have put nearly 1,000 occupied units under R.T.C. control.
The consensus among bankers, lawyers and others involved with co-ops and condominiums in distress is that, for now, workouts are the best hope for financial recovery.
These deals can take many forms. In many instances, the lender restructures the mortgage by lowering the interest rate, stretching out the payment period or letting the co-op make interest-only payments for a period. In other cases the co-op is given control of the unsold units by either the lender, if there has been a foreclosure, or the sponsor. When this arrangement is part of a workout plan, the units often are reoffered for sale to their occupants at rock-bottom prices.
An ongoing effort to unravel the tangled finances of a 10-unit co-op on West 103d Street in Manhattan shows how delicate these negotiations can be. With assistance from the Attorney General's office, the four resident owners are trying to work out a solution.
IF the plan the agency has proposed holds up, it will put six unsold units, a $69,492 cash payment and back maintenance from defaulted sponsors' investors in the hands of the corporation. The co-op would take control of the apartments -- two of which are now empty and could be sold or rented -- and gain control of the corporation's business.
But the resident owners are wary.
"We want to work out this situation," said Susan Mancuso, one of the resident shareholders, "but we see potential problems in the settlement. If the deal goes through we inherit the complete liability of the sponsor, including a shortfall of almost $4,000 a month that is not covered by the rents. Given the state of the market, sales are unlikely. Who would buy an apartment with maintenances as high as ours?"
Ms. Mancuso said that the shareholders could not afford an increase in the maintenance charge, now more than $950 a month on their one-bedroom units. The other worry is the potential burden of assuming total responsibility for the $465,000 mortgage, privately financed, which comes due on Aug. 1.
"We think there were serious problems with the conversion plan," Ms. Mancuso said, "so we want some assurance that we won't be left holding the bag when the sponsors get off the hook."
A spokesman for the Attorney General said the agency could act only as a facilitator in the negotiations and not impose a settlement.
In many financially pressured buildings, the lenders holding loans taken by sponsors on their unsold shares foreclose, taking control of the collateralized units. Such foreclosures turned out to be boons for many buildings; they obliged the lenders to pick up the sponsors' portion of the maintenance.
Even when a bank steps in to cover a shortfall, problems often remain.
A CASE in point was the situation at the Kimberly, a 400 unit co-op conversion in Yonkers. According to a member of the board, in August 1990 Coronet Properties, the sponsor of the conversion plan there, stopped paying its share of the maintenance on the apartments it owned. Coronet put a second mortage on the building using unsold shares as collateral. Union Savings Bank of Patchogue, L.I., held the second mortgage and paid Coronet's share of the bills until it foreclosed earlier this month.
While Union Savings' contributions relieved the corporation of a short-term financial crisis, for the long term it left the building in limbo.
"Coronet's problems became our problems," said Amie Reinhertz, a member of the board of directors. "The taint of the sponsor's troubles and the bank's delay was very hard on owners because no one was able to sell because banks would not give mortgages for our building."
Ms. Reinhertz said that an additional worry for some owners is that their own mortgages are held by Coronet, which offered to finance inside purchases as a sales incentive. The board hopes the recent foreclosure by Union Savings will lead to fresh start.
"When Coronet moves out of the picture," she said, "we can start solving some of the problems here. Until then, things are sort of frozen."
Some feel a lasting solution to the risk of sponsor default can come only when the laws are changed to make it harder to convert a rental building into a co-op or condominium.
For more than five years, Attorney General Abrams has been urging legislators to amend the conversion laws to increase from the present 15 to 25 percent the percentage of apartments that must be sold for a noneviction conversion to take place. Measures passed by the State Assembly have stalled in the Senate.
Claire Shulman, Borough President of Queens, which has many troubled buildings, has been among those in New York City who have called for stiffer conversion requirements.
"We are still taking distress calls," said Andrew Kelman, an aide to Mrs. Shulman who has set up a task force to help troubled co-ops. "It may be that overall the picture is getting better, but we have not seen a significant diminution of the problem. There have to be changes in the laws."

Survey Finds Support for the Arts

BYLINE: By ROBERT SHERMAN

 BODY:
THE recession has taken its toll on the arts. Public and private donations are way down, and one organization after another has been forced to cut back operations. Many have been forced to shut down.
But there is a brighter side to the artistic picture, delivered in a nationwide survey conducted for the American Council for the Arts by Louis Harris and Associates and underwritten by Philip Morris Companies Inc. 
 The American people, the report found, do care about the arts, and in far greater numbers than one might have supposed. They attend concerts, support artistic training in the public schools and are even willing, up to a point, to pay higher taxes for government financing of arts programs. The telephone poll, conducted in February, surveyed 1,500 adults nationally. The sampling margin of error is plus or minus 3 percent.
"This survey has been conducted in the middle of what the vast majority of Americans feel is one of the deepest recessions that has gripped the country in some time" Mr. Harris said. "It is striking that all regions of the country, all strata of education, all races and all income levels support Federal funding of the arts. The results are clear-cut and decisive, the majorities are significantly high."
Despite the controversy swirling about the National Endowment for the Arts's support of specific artists and arts programs, the public vote on separating government financing from government control was also decisive, with nearly 80 percent of the sample opposed to artistic restrictions.
More than 90 percent of those who responded to the poll confirmed that the arts should be required as part of the public school curriculum; 6 of every 10 adults interviewed said that the arts are just as important to a youngster as math and science. And 8 of every 10 respondents maintained that in studying the arts, children could learn skills that would be useful in a job.
The Harris survey looked at music specifically and found that 28 percent of the respondents play a musical instrument; 17 percent sing in a choir or other vocal group, and 35 percent are involved with the dance (although that figure may be misleading since it includes aerobics). It also reported that 20 percent listen "frequently" to classical music, 21 percent attended four or more classical concerts last year, 9 percent are "frequent" purchasers of classical tapes or records, 24 percent have attended live opera or musical theater performances and 21 percent have attended live dance programs.
"We took the name 'Friends of Music' from the 'Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde,' started in Vienna by Beethoven and his pupil and patron Archduke Rudolf," said Ruth Steinkraus Cohen, the pianist who founded the Friends organization with two colleagues, the violist-conductor Frank Brieff and the composer-critic Artur Holde. "The idea in 1813 was to mingle composers, performers, patrons, presenters and audience together: before the performance to study, afterwards to enjoy conversation and refreshments. That is still our idea, which makes us unique among chamber music series."
As the Friends' 35th anniversary season comes to a close, it has continued to follow a distinguished path. On Wednesday evening at 8:15, the violist and arts consultant William Selden will give a lecture and ademonstration, "Listening to Fugues," at his home in Westport; the final concert of the season will be Saturday at 8:30 P.M. in the Unitarian Church, followed by refreshments. The performers, all from Connecticut, are Viviane Bertolami, a violinist and the director of the "Adventures in Music" series at the Burndy Library in Norwalk; Sadao Harada, a cellist in the Tokyo String Quartet, and David Korevaar, a pianist and founding member of the Hexagon Ensemble. They will present Trios of Dvorak and Tchaikovsky (227-3345 or 227-2253).

HEADLINE: Talking: Eviction;
Facing Up To Arrears In the Rent

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

 BODY:
AFTER being laid off and having problems getting unemployment compensation, a medical technician at St. Raphael's Hospital in New Haven found herself threatened with eviction from her $550-a-month apartment a few months ago.
Such tales are becoming common as the recession touches the lives of a growing number of people, many of whom never dreamed of facing such a predicament. And landlords, worried about cash flow, are taking action as fast as possible. 
 Housing Court in New York City is so backed up with eviction cases resulting from nonpayment of rent that lawyers say a legal eviction can now take six months.
"Only the permanent underclass used to have trouble meeting rent payments," said Glenn Falk, managing attorney of the housing unit at New Haven Legal Assistance, a federally funded legal-aid office that helped the technician. "Now we're hearing from all sorts of people."
Though it may seem at first that there is little tenants can do when their money runs out, they usually have more options than they realize. These include: working out a delayed payment plan to slowly make up the arrears, negotiating for a lower rent, temporarily tapping the funds being held as a security deposit, filing for bankruptcy to wipe out or lower the arrears, taking in a roommate, subletting to someone who can afford to pay or negotiating with the landlord for a transfer to a less costly unit.
Mr. Falk's office discovered a defect in the way the eviction papers had been served on the medical technician. This helped delay the case until her unemployment checks started coming in.
A landlord might be willing to strike a deal because it can cost more to replace than to work with a delinquent tenant, especially if the tenant is normally reliable and likely to find another job soon.
"The landlord has to consider the loss of rental income while he finds someone else," said Robert A. Jacobs, a Manhattan lawyer. "He has to paint and fix up and pay a broker's commission." The only exception would be a rent-regulated apartment where a vacancy would permit a rent increase.
Moreover, even if the landlord decides to get rid of the delinquent tenant he might be stuck with that person -- and no rent coming in -- for six months until the case could be heard. If the tenant chose to contest the eviction, the case could drag on even longer.
A reason for the tenant to negotiate is that just ignoring dunning notices could make it hard to be accepted elsewhere. "Once you get a bad reputation you could find it hard to get another landlord to take you," said Mr. Falk.
Also, a callous disregard for a landlord tends to anger a judge. Ignoring the court papers also keeps tenants from offering evidence in their own defense.
The other common mistake, said Mr. Falk, is to panic and run away after getting the first notice from the court. Instead, the troubled tenant should seek advice from the clerk of the court (named in the papers), a legal aid office or a private lawyer.
It's normally best to begin negotiations before arrears pile up to a point where the landlord is enraged and eviction seems inevitable. The strategy selected should be based on whether the financial crisis is likely to be temporary or long-lasting.
If the cash crisis is temporary -- say there was a layoff and the tenant now has another job -- it is worth trying to reach a settlement.
Walter Jennings, a Manhattan lawyer who has been representing tenants for 21 years, favors starting with an informal offer to set up a plan that permits the arrears to be paid off gradually. If the tenant would have great difficulty paying off the arrears, Mr. Jennings recommends seeking relief from the city's One Shot Deal program.
Available since 1989 from the New York City Department of Social Services, it will -- under certain circumstances -- provide tenants facing eviction for nonpayment of the rent with a grant to cover arrears. Over 3,000 families have received such grants.
OTHER municipalities and states have similar grant programs. In New Haven, for example, it is called the Rent Bank (details can be obtained from any local social service or legal-aid agency). Each case is judged individually, with grants most often approved when the tenant would otherwise lose the apartment, has no other assets but now has a job and an income to meet current and future rent obligations.
Mr. Jennings recently represented a divorced woman who had been diverting rent money to cover medical expenses for her teen-age daughter. A year later, with eviction inevitable, Mr. Jennings said he was able to get $7,500 towards the arrears paid by the One Shot Deal program because the woman had a steady job as a receptionist and her ex-husband agreed to pay the daughter's expenses.
If a grant or compromise cannot be obtained and the landlord refuses to consider a payment plan, a third option would be to file for personal bankruptcy. Doing so should temporarily halt a pending eviction, said Mr. Jennings, and force the landlord to accept a compromise settlement -- say, 30 percent of of the arrears.
But it will not eliminate the tenant's obligation to pay ongoing rent. Lowering that figure can be done, said Mr. Jennings, only when it is clear that comparable rents have declined.
John Griffin, president of Griffin Realty, a Manhattan company that manages and rents market-rate apartments, said he has worked out deals in which the security deposit is temporarily used to cover missing rent. But a landlord will allow that, he said, when the tenant is without income only temporarily and willeventually be able restore the deposit to its original level.
Another way out is to take in a roommate. In New York State a single tenant has an automatic right to bring in another individual under the state's 1983 Roommate Law. In other states it will depend on local law and the terms of the current lease. Rights to temporarily sublease an apartment also are based on local law and lease terms.
Yet a further way out would be to find a cheaper apartment. But before rushing to look elsewhere the tenant should ask the landlord if he has a less expensive apartment in the same or a nearby building, said Mr. Jacobs. This could prevent the loss of the deposit money that often accompanies a broken lease.
If the apartment is rent regulated and the rent is low, the tenant might even get the landlord to cover the moving costs, said Mr. Jacobs, because a vacancy in such an apartment can entitle an owner to a substantial rent increase."

HEADLINE: Streetscapes: The Fred R. French Building;
Refurbishing 'Mesopatamia'

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY

 BODY:
THE highly colored terra cotta of the 1927 Fred F. French Building at 551 Fifth Avenue, at 45th Street, has been wrapped in scaffolding for two years. This fall, as a $9 million facade restoration is completed, it will reappear. A fresh look at the building's ancient styling and skyscraper modernity should give anyone a start.
Fred Fillmore French, developer of the building, began his real estate career in 1908. In 1921 he hit on the "French plan" to finance his development activity -- each project was sold as common stock to small investors. By avoiding traditional bank financing he was able to maximize both control and profits, a goal he furthered by organizing his own departments for architecture and property management. 
 By the mid-1920's French had built a dozen good-sized apartment houses this way. In 1925, he began the project bearing his name.
The 38-story building was unusual in many respects. According to "New York 1930," by Robert A.M. Stern, Gregory Gilmartin and Thomas Mellins, it was an early example of the new rectangular skyscraper at a time when towers were usually square. This allowed more flexible layouts and opened up more sites for development.
Its style, according to French's house architect, H. Douglas Ives, is "Mesopotamian," Working with John Sloan as consulting architect, Ives produced a tall slab, rather ungainly, but with dazzling decoration. At the lobby, a coffered bronze portal with rams' heads and other Near Eastern elements leads to brilliant ceiling murals in archaic styles and what is probably the only Assyrian Revival mailbox in New York City.
On the exterior, the middle of the tower is trimmed in bands of bright terra cotta, red, black and other colors. At the top is surely one of New York's signature architectural elements: Facing north and south are giant, brilliantly colored faience panels with sunburst designs. According to Ives, they are sunrises indicating progress and the flanking, Assyrian-style griffins represent integrity and watchfulness.
Panels on the east and west facades carry heads of Mercury "spreading the message of the French plan," according to Ives. They are high above street level but, once spotted, they make the building hard to forget.
George S. Chappell, architectural critic of The New Yorker, ignored the color and styling and criticized the "rows of dreary factory windows," adding: "Can't the Fifth Avenue Association do something about this?" The 1939 "W.P.A. Guide to New York City" called the faience work "of questionable taste."
As he moved his real estate firm into 551 Fifth Avenue, French was also moving ahead with his giant Tudor City complex and would assemble his employees every morning for inspirational sales talks. Much of his Tudor-style office still survives on the 12th and 13th floors.
In 1986, the Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the building a landmark a year after it was bought by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. The facade restoration began in 1990 and is being supervised by Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates.
If the large tile panels look like small bursts of color from afar, they are cascades close up. Glazes of plum, orange, yellow, gold, tropical green and other colors cover "some of the biggest pieces of terra cotta I've ever seen in my life, some four feet long," says Diane Kaese, senior architect on the job.
SHE believes French paid close attention to the economics of building. He used limestone sills throughout the facade, except where setbacks rendered them invisible from the street, where he used less expensive precast concrete.
The large faience panels are in excellent shape; it is the terra cotta banding in other locations that has required massive replacement, because it is next to steel shelf angles. These were designed without flashing to protect them from water and they have rusted and expanded, cracking the terra cotta. Kimball Beasley, an engineer with the firm, says the lack of such a detail is common in the period. "Architects just didn't realize that some water would inevitably get inside a building," he said, and they supposed interior steel work required little protection.
The work is to be completed and the scaffolding removed in September, when the rich sunbursts will shine out again. Until then, there is an additional reward for the few fortunate enough to prowl the temporary boards around the top. The limestone coping at this level was not as highly controlled for uniformity. There are a dozen or more pieces that would never be used at street level. They are "spoiled" by a riot of fossilized plant life, shells and marine animals, elements of an ancient sea floor brought to the top of this skyscraper inspired by antiquity.

HEADLINE: Contest Introduces Students to Wall Street Risks

BYLINE: By TOM TOOLEN

 BODY:
THE red brick elementary school in East Orange may seem an unlikely place to run across the trappings of Wall Street, but for 10 weeks more than 200 students at the school, the Jackson Academy, were engaged in managing stock portfolios worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Each of the participating classes received a theoretical $100,000 to invest in any stock listed on the New York, American or NASDAQ stock exchanges. And at the end of April, their results were compared with those chalked up by some 20,000 students across the state -- all players in a competition called the Stock Market Game. 
 A total of 1,900 New Jersey teams, from fourth grade through college, participated in the game, including 7,000 high school students and several hundred college students. Nationwide, 400,000 students took part. The game has been sponsored in the state for seven years by the New Jersey Council on Economic Education, which is associated with the New York-based Securities Industries Association.
"The game really helps the students gain insights into math and logic," said Gladys Calhoun, principal of the Jackson Academy, "as well as giving them an insight into how the American economic system works. Many of the students did not know what a stock was before they started playing the game."
 
First Place, for a While
 Though the entire student body of the Jackson Academy participated in the Stock Market Game for the 10 weeks that ended in the last week of April, the clear stars at the school were in Adele Braswell's fourth-grade class.
For two golden weeks in March, the 22 fourth graders in Ms. Braswell's class were in first place among all fourth graders in the state. A banner quickly went up in their classroom, and it read: "This is the home of the Wall Street whiz kids."
"The students couldn't wait to get to school to see how their stock was doing," Ms. Braswell said.
At the start of the competition, the students chose only one stock, CBS Inc. "They liked watching the Olympics and some of the children's shows on CBS, so they went with their hearts," Ms. Braswell said.
It worked for a while. The CBS stock they bought at $141 a share jumped to $161. Then the students decided to get out of CBS, figuring that it had gone as high as it was going to, and bought I.B.M. shares.
"If we had held it a bit longer, it would have been better because eventually CBS climbed into the 180's," said Ms. Braswell, a former fashion editor who has been teaching for three years. The class ended up in 23d place in the state.
 
Effect on Self-Esteem
 Ms. Braswell said the game had worked wonders with the students' self-esteem. "The children became winners," she said, "and they came to school excited about what they were doing as they looked at the financial pages of the paper to see where their stock was. It also opened up the possibility of a new world, Wall Street."
Mrs. Calhoun, the principal, said the contest fitted perfectly with the goals of the school. "We tell the students that they can do anything and accomplish anything if they keep trying," said Mrs. Calhoun, who has taught for 24 years in the East Orange school system.
"We know that there is often trouble outside our doors, but when the students walk into this building in the morning, we shut all that out," she said. "The only aim here is to learn and achieve."
The Wall Street game has changed some plans among Ms. Braswell's students. "I want to be a stockbroker when I grow up," said Tatteera Sampson, 10, as she bounded to her feet to answer a question.
Did she know about stockbrokers before the game? "Well, no, not really, but it was fun," she said, a smile breaking across her face. "Besides, you can make money playing this game."
 
Doing 'Something Better'
 But Renai Field, 11, has resisted Wall Street's lure. "I want to be a teacher like Ms. Braswell," Renai said. "I like the game, but Ms. Braswell does something better. She helps us."
Contestants were divided into four categories based on age. In the category for grades four to six, the winner was the Memorial School of Union Beach, which made $128,551 on its paper portfolio. The Jackson Academy's 23d-place finish was accomplished with a figure of $103,062.
The competition for grades seven to nine was won by students from the Yayneh Academy of Paramus with a portfolio of $155,011.
The largest portfolio and the grand prize winner was in the high school category, where a two-student team from Northern Valley Regional High School in Old Tappan ended up with $168,928.
The winners, Scott Soussa and Brian Havbas, both of Old Tappan and both juniors, divided their $100,000 between two stocks, Walt Disney Company and Digital Equipment Corporation. After some buying and selling, they took on a major stake, 10,000 in shares, in College Bound, an educational testing company.
 
'Definitely a Big Break'
 Then they heard on a television program that College Bound was in trouble. They sold their shares at $18, and the stock plummeted to $8.
"It was definitely a big break," Brian Havbas said. Both youths said they were considering a career on Wall Street.
The college category was won by students from Gloucester County Community College with a portfolio of $107,565.
In the Stock Market Game, said Dr. Robert L. Stout, president of the New Jersey Commission on Economic Education, "the students also learn communication skills and most importantly learn the value and limitations of money."

HEADLINE: A New Strategy For Luring Vacationers

BYLINE: By HELEN PIKE

 BODY:
EUGENE DILBECK, the state's travel and tourism director, stood before an easel in the interpretive center at Liberty State Park in Jersey City, describing for the benefit of the State Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee the national advertising campaign his office started this spring. Its slogan is "New Jersey: You Should See Us Now!"
The ads carry images of history, seafood, amusements, casinos and the outdoors, and they are part of a major new strategy to convince out-of-state travelers that New Jersey's image as a polluted, crime-ridden stepchild of a state is out of date. 
 A tall, ebullient 49-year-old with a pronounced Midwestern drawl, Mr. Dilbeck took his post two years ago as the first professional -- as opposed to political -- appointee to head the New Jersey Division of Travel and Tourism. He has presided over the division's first study of the travel and spending habits of vacationers to the state and over a strong move to unify a traditionally fragmented tourism industry.
But the Office of Legislative Services recommends trimming $2.6 million from Mr. Dilbeck's proposed fiscal 1993 advertising and promotion budget of $5.1 million. On May 13, Mr. Dilbeck was calling upon all his considerable selling skills to convince the appropriations committee that his $5.1 million ad budget proposal should remain intact.
It was not Mr. Dilbeck's first experience with the budget ax. The division's budget over all, which reached a high of $9 million in 1988, has been steadily cut back. Last year it dropped to $6.3 million, and his total proposed budget for 1993 is $6.2 million.
Mr. Dilbeck was showing an ad that featured a colorful blur of an amusement park ride and a headline, "New Jersey at 75 M.P.H.," when Senator John H. Ewing, Republican of Bedminster, interrupted. "Don't you think that ad gives the impression young people can go 75 miles an hour on our highways?" the Senator asked. Mr. Dilbeck hesitated, slightly thrown off balance, then responded, "I'm sure the Department of Public Safety would tell us if there is a correlation between our ads and speeding on the roadways." Senator Ewing shrugged, and Mr. Dilbeck continued.
Later, Senator Dick LaRossa, Republican of Ewing Township, spoke up. "Has anyone ever heard of Trenton, home to eight million people?" he asked, noting that the State House, subject of a multimillion-dollar restoration completed earlier this year, appeared nowhere in the ads.
"I assure you, Senator, next year we'll do that," Mr. Dilbeck said.
In his campaign to hold on to his budget, Mr. Dilbeck has the benefit of a new study commissioned by his office indicating that tourism plays a much larger role in the state's economy than previously believed. Estimates of annual tourism revenue had ranged from $10 billion to $13 billion, while the new figure for 1991 is $17.8 billion -- making tourism second in revenue to the pharmaceutical-chemical industry.
That was a 2.4 percent drop from 1990's revenue, but Mr. Dilbeck says this result was a tribute to the division's 1991 multimedia advertising campaign in light of the adverse effects that the Persian Gulf war and the severe recession had on travel.
Last year's $4.5 million campaign sought to raise the awareness level of the state's varied tourism offerings, with particular attention to weeklong travelers, who typically spend more money than day-trippers or vacationers visiting relatives.
 
Commissioned a Study
 Mr. Dilbeck also commissioned Longwoods International, a travel market research company in Toronto, to conduct a comprehensive study of the state's tourism potential and tourism industry. Interviews were conducted with focus groups in Toronto, Boston, Atlanta, Dallas and Chicago. The groups, said William Siegel, president of Longwoods, were made up of people "who had had some kind of experience in New Jersey and those who wouldn't reject it outright."
"The real surprise," Mr. Siegel said, "was that people do respond positively when they find out what New Jersey has to offer."
An even more dramatic surprise was the 264 percent rise in requests for travel literature in 1991 over 1990 in response to the new advertising. "I've never seen this kind of response before," said Mr. Siegel, who has been studying travel and tourism trends since 1985.
"New Jersey was being passed by because it never marketed itself as a touring destination," Mr. Siegel said. He added that few states seriously market their tourism or even have professionals in the job.
Mr. Dilbeck, who hails from Cassville, Mo., was hired by Gov. Jim Florio after 15 years in the industry, including stints in Texas and Oklahoma. A three-day car trip from the Delaware River area through Princeton to Cape May and the Wildwoods convinced him there was more to New Jersey than negative headlines.
 
'A Lot Is Going On'
 "A lot is going on in New Jersey," said Mr. Dilbeck, who talks enthusiastically of the state's mountain ranges and recreational opportunities, its historic sites and culture. "I never had the opportunity to sell beaches and skiing at the same time," he said about the chance to do year-round promotions.
Tourism in New Jersey has historically been viewed as a summer-only shore-area industry. Mr. Dilbeck has sought to change that view. "Marketing a destination is very scientific," he said. "Research gives us perspectives."
The Longwoods study found that certain areas promoted themselves as single destinations, divorced from any identity with the rest of the state. The result, Mr. Dilbeck said, is that travelers have little awareness of what exists beyond any of the major highways they use to get to those destinations.
Atlantic City, for example, had been promoting only its casinos and entertainment, primarily to bus tours that never detoured from the Garden State Parkway. This kind of narrow focus had left the public with the perception that the city was "small, kind of seedy and not very safe" when compared with other gaming spots in the country.
"Even Atlantic City had a lot to offer in the way of charm and history when it was presented differently," Mr. Siegel said.
 
Change Seen in Promotion
 Paula Williams, operator of the Whistling Swan Inn, a bed-and-breakfast in Stanhope, said, "Tourism used to be every person for himself." Now, she said, all the regions are more equally promoted. Mr. Dilbeck, she said, has brought planning, documentation, objectives and specific business applications to the state's tourism industry.
"The political appointees were sincere, wanting to do the right thing, but they had no specific plans," she added. "We never came together before."
Mr. Dilbeck has established committees representing a cross section of the tourism industry: airlines, convention centers, hotels and motels, restaurant associations and bed-and-breakfast inns.
The travel and tourism director has also created groups whose members are drawn from the ranks of both tourism and state government. Representatives from the Department of Transportation monitor the state's traffic infrastructure, while representatives of the Department of Environmental Protection and Energy monitor beach pollution.
 
Handling News on Beaches
 News of any instance of beach pollution, for example, has the net effect of keeping people away from the 127-mile shoreline, Mr. Dilbeck said, while only a quarter of a mile might be affected. "We have to get the word out that all the rest of the beaches are still open," he said.
Senator Joseph M. Kryillos Jr., Republican of Middletown Township and chairman of the State Senate Committee on Coastal Resources and Tourism, said of Mr. Dilbeck, "He can see our strengths and weaknesses from an outside perspective" and praised his "real understanding" of the state industry.
 
'He's a Tourist'
 Steve Richer, president of the Atlantic City Convention and Visitors Bureau, added that Mr. Dilbeck had another advantage:
"He's a tourist. He's an 'aw shucks' person from America's heartland. Golly, if he likes it, then others are bound to like it, too."
The Longwoods data showed that in 1991 travelers spent $5.5 billion on food, $4.4 billion on retail purchases, $2.5 billion on gambling and $1.8 billion on lodging.
Overnight visitors generated $10.2 billion in revenue, and day-trippers, $5.1 billion. Tourists spent more than $5.9 billion in Atlantic County last year, and $5.2 billion in the Gateway region, which includes the counties of Bergen, Essex, Hudson, Middlesex, Passaic and Union. The Delaware River region, including the counties of Burlington, Camden, Gloucester, Mercer and Salem, brought in $2 billion. And in the Skylands region, including Hunterdon, Morris, Somerset, Sussex and Warren Counties, the total was $1.6 billion.
The state collected $2.2 billion in taxes from the tourism industry last year and sustained a total of 353,000 jobs.

HEADLINE: Ye Olde Inferiority Complex

BYLINE: By ELISABETH GINSBURG

 BODY:
THERE are times when thoughts of New Jersey bring a tear to the eye -- times when trash fires spew forth enough airborne contaminants to cause widespread weeping on both sides of the Hudson. Or when mayors of various communities are under investigation for various forms of corruption. Or when headlines tell of the latest roundup of New Jersey-based mobsters or the State Health Department declares war on eggs "over easy."
A rich compost of negative images applied over three centuries has given rise to one of the state's hardiest crops, the collective inferiority complex. 
 Radio, television and movies have contributed to the problem by coming up with thousands of throwaway lines, but New Jerseyans themselves seem strangely compelled to assist in the process. The New Jersey joke thrives in part, said a Rutgers sociologist, Dr. Karen Cerulo, because "people who are insecure about themselves develop a self-deprecating humor."
Dr. Margaret Snyder, a clinical psychologist in Upper Montclair, agrees. Because the state is associated with so many negative images, she said, an insecure individual is not likely to live in New Jersey voluntarily. "People who are insecure are more concerned about addresses," she said.
Children whose parents praise their accomplishments are less likely to grow up to be the kind of adults who suffer from the New Jersey inferiority complex, Dr. Snyder said. But she added that the problem did not rank high on her patients' neurosis scale.
"The New Jersey inferiority complex is a pervasive attitude," she said, "but not a treatment issue."
The sense of collective inferiority may stem from the fact that New Jersey received insufficient nurturing as an infant. England, the mother country, paid much more attention to New Jersey's more boisterous siblings, New York and Pennsylvania. From 1703 until Lewis Morris became governor in 1738, New Jersey was even forced to share a governor with New York.
William Penn was the first public figure to rise to New Jersey's defense: "It is not right in any to despise or dispraise it." Unfortunately, the "despising and dispraising" continued.
Though many travelers found the state beautiful and inspiring, complaints about predatory mosquitoes and bad roads were numerous. Bad or not, the roads were well used.
 
Benjamin Franklin's Line
 Benjamin Franklin's frequently quoted aphorism -- that New Jersey is "a keg tapped at both ends" -- neatly sums up another major cause of the state's identity problem. Long before the New Jersey Turnpike smoothed the bumps out of travel, New Jersey was known primarily as a conduit between New York City and Philadelphia.
"In order for human beings to develop an identity, they must become separated from things outside themselves," Dr. Cerulo said. From pre-Revolutionary times, New Jerseyans have been hard pressed to establish the degree of separation needed to form that distinct identity.
Dr. Angus Gillespie, co-author of "Looking for America on the New Jersey Turnpike" (Rutgers University Press, 1989) and professor of American studies at Rutgers, says New Jersey's image has a lot to do with the behemoth across the Hudson.
"In the 19th century, Manhattanites looked down on Brooklyn," said Dr. Gillespie, who noted that Manhattan's censorious gaze began focusing on New Jersey at the turn of the century, around the time Brooklyn was incorporated into the City of New York.
 
Changes After World War II
 Dr. Cerulo thinks that commuters who live in New Jersey and work in New York are particularly susceptible to a feeling of inferiority because "they have to take so many jokes from co-workers."
The volume of New Jersey jokes increased exponentially after World War II when the suburbanization of northern New Jersey took place. The spurt in road building, including the completion of the turnpike, brought millions of additional nonresidents barreling through the state, seeing the ugliest, most blighted parts of the landscape rather than more bucolic vistas.
The poet Robert Burns wrote that it is a gift "to see ourselves as others see us." For New Jerseyans, such a gift may have dubious value.
Dr. Gillespie contrasts New Jersey with Connecticut, a state he says is similar in size, level of industrialization and infrastructure. In Connecticut, he said, many of the highways run through rolling countryside, whereas in New Jersey they go by tank farms. That explains why Connecticut has a pastoral New England image, he said, while New Jersey is viewed as a soulless expanse of rusting industry.
New Jersey joke fodder continued to pile up at an impressive rate in the 1960's when the Federal Government began investigating municipal corruption. In the 70's and early 80's, more unsavory images presented themselves as state and Federal officials began unearthing toxic dump sites.
 
Embracing the Negative
 If, as Dr. Cerulo suggests, the New Jersey joke is a result of insecurity, then New Jerseyans have some of the highest amounts of insecurity anywhere. "In a perverse way, New Jerseyans embrace the negative image," Dr. Gillespie said.
Residents of Buffalo may equate blizzard survival with machismo, but New Jerseyans have grafted an almost heroic collection of beliefs and attitudes onto their gritty industrial roots. In his book, the Rutgers educator writes of seeing T-shirts at Newark International Airport emblazoned with the slogan: "New Jersey -- Only the Tough Survive."
By the mid-1980's, New Jersey's image seemed to be emerging from decades of gloom. Bruce Springsteen, whose songs celebrated New Jersey's grittiness, was riding a mammoth wave of popularity, and the Meadowlands and the Garden State Arts Center gave the state its own focal points for entertainment and culture.
In late 1984, the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University conducted an extensive opinion poll, concluding that New Jerseyans "are beginning to identify more strongly with their home state and to take pride in New Jersey."
 
Fewer New Jersey Jokes
 And what of the 90's? This year, the Nets were in the playoffs for the first time since 1986. The Devils slapped the puck from New Jersey into the Stanley Cup playoffs. The New Jersey Symphony enjoyed a national prominence. And Eric Magnusson, manager of Rascal's Comedy Club in West Orange, said the comedians he saw were not spending much time on New Jersey jokes anymore.
Yet a smaller-scale Eagleton Institute poll released in July 1990 suggests that the state's residents have become somewhat less satisfied with the quality of New Jersey life. Poll takers found that 59 percent of respondents rated New Jersey an "excellent" or "good" place to live, as opposed to 78 percent in February 1988 and 80 percent in December 1984.
Dr. Gillespie said the sour economy had made a difference. "We're not as ebullient as in the mid-80's, but we're still making a comeback," he said.
Is there a more permanent cure for the inferiority complex that can withstand the vagaries of economic fluctuations? Dr. Cerulo held out hope.
She suggested an increase in the amount of attention given to New Jersey history and culture in elementary and secondary school curriculums: "Just as more inclusive history curriculums have boosted ethnic pride, an increase in New Jersey-centered education could boost pride in the state."
 
A Lack of Totems
 New Jersey's quest for a positive image is also hampered by its lack of totems, she said. After three centuries there is still no state song, and the Meadowlands is probably too new to be identified as a cultural icon. "New Jersey has no Liberty Bell, no Empire State Building," she said, "and people bond to symbols."
What symbols could New Jerseyans bond to? Celebrating the traffic cloverleaf, a notable New Jersey first, conjures up thoughts of those notorious toll roads. Saltwater taffy is primarily associated with the Shore. Hymns of praise to the New Jersey tomato might be open to all kinds of interpretations. And the blueberry is tasty and nutritionally correct, but it lacks charisma.
"Take images which have no previous meaning," Dr. Cerulo advised, "and elevate them to public consciousness." The European Community has done very well with its new flag and anthem, she said.
What is required above all, Dr. Cerulo said, is a widespread resolution to change the negative image behind the inferiority complex -- an all-out, statewide effort. Even then, she warned, "it doesn't happen overnight."

HEADLINE: The View From: Mount Vernon;
Celebrating 100 Years of Struggling Toward a Better Life

BYLINE: By JAMES FERON

DATELINE: MOUNT VERNON

 BODY:
WHEN Ronald A. Blackwood arrived in Mount Vernon from Jamaica in 1955 "to bunk in with a friend" while he looked for work, the 28-year-old Caribbean immigrant was following a path that others had traveled -- and would continue to travel -- for a century.
"There was an apartment waiting for me in Brooklyn, but I liked what I saw in Mount Vernon," he said. "So I stayed." Thirty years later he became the city's first black Mayor, and this year he will preside over Mount Vernon's centennial. 
 "I still like Mount Vernon," he said, after reviewing its strengths and weaknesses in a lengthy interview. "We have people from 92 nations, and they continue to arrive." Next Saturday, in what is likely to be the highlight of its 100th-year ceremonies, Mayor Blackwood will preside over Mount Vernon's Centennial Ball.
The ball is listed as a black-tie affair, but attendees are also welcome to come in native or period clothing as part of the city's effort to promote its ethnic diversity. They will pay $60 a plate for the five-course dinner and dance, which is to be held in a decorated cafeteria at Mount Vernon High School.
 
Metal Detectors Approved
 It is perhaps a sign of the times that the school has been the focus of less celebratory news in recent months. Responding to the fatal shooting of three Mount Vernon teen-agers, the Board of Education voted on April 3 to install walk-through metal detectors at the high school.
The Superintendent of Schools, Dr. William C. Prattella, said, "We're still considering whether to install them." He noted that none of the shootings took place inside the high school and that metal detectors, the first outside of New York City, would be a precautionary move.
The century that followed Mount Vernon's incorporation as a city on April 1, 1892, has produced an uneven profile and an uncertain future. Some of the most dramatic changes have come in the last half-century, when Mount Vernon became the first step for lower-middle-income families leaving New York City as well as a refuge for families displaced by urban renewal projects elsewhere in Westchester.
Mayor Blackwood said that when he arrived in Mount Vernon a decade after the end of World War II, minority groups represented 15 to 20 percent of the population. Since then "it has changed significantly," he said, "to about a 50-50 mix, with the school population about 75 percent minorities."
The black population, which rose from 7 percent in 1945 to 30 percent by the mid-1960's, stands today at 55 percent; the city's population is 40 percent white and 8 percent Hispanic. Minority members make up 84 per cent of the school population: 76 percent black and 8 percent Hispanic.
It was in the 1960's that Mount Vernon began to cope with a problem that was to affect other Westchester cities, changing from a middle-class residential suburb with strong buying power to a city that began to resemble New York City in its economic and social aspects.
While blacks who flocked to Mount Vernon in the postwar years included many professionals and semi-professionals who integrated easily, the city was becoming segregated -- with whites taking up residence north of the Metro-North railroad tracks and blacks clustering south of the tracks. It became difficult, and finally impossible, to achieve racial balance in the schools as blacks became the majority.
 
School System Improvement
 But the public school system -- 2 middle schools and 11 elementary schools in addition to the high school -- has improved over the past two decades. "In the 1970's, we had 75 percent of our students scoring below the state reference point in pupil reading and math evaluation tests," Dr. Prattella said. "Now we have fewer than 2 percent scoring below that state level." Both middle schools are magnet schools: one offers performing arts, mathematics and science; the other global studies, business and law.
The 1990 census, meanwhile, tends to support Mayor Blackwood's optimism over the future of Mount Vernon. The number of professionals increased from 21 percent in 1980 to 27 percent in 1990, the percent of high school graduates increased from 64 to 71 percent and the percentage of residents holding bachelor degrees increased from 14 to 20 percent.
Median household income more than doubled, from $16,000 to $35,000, as did median family income, from $20,000 to $41,000. The percentage living below the poverty line dropped from 14.6 percent to 11.8 percent and 31 percent of Mount Vernon's residents reported incomes of $50,000 or more in the 1990 census.
The number of housing units owned and occupied by residents increased over the decade, from 4,600 to 5,100 for whites and from 3,180 to 3,900 for blacks. Rentals by whites dropped sharply from 8,700 to 6,500 while rentals by black families rose marginally, from 8,200 to 8,700.
The median value of owner-occupied housing soared from $63,000 to $227,000 over the decade, in part a result of the housing boom in the 1980's. This startling increase in the value of Mount Vernon real estate lends some credence to an assertion made by Mayor Blackwood that "you can buy an excellent house for sometimes 75 percent of the asking price."
"Some places you pay for the name," he said, "like when you buy certain name brand goods they are sometimes no better than the house brand. You don't get a better buy, but you pay for the name. You pay for Scarsdale, you pay for Bronxville, because people want to live in those communities -- they're on top of the world."
"But you can live the same way in Mount Vernon," Mayor Blackwood added, "at much less cost with equivalent services. Would you believe we have people who move from Broxnville to Mount Vernon?"
There are other statistics, however, that paint a less positive picture. Crime is increasing, as indicated by a 6 percent increase from 1990 to 1991 in the number of calls for police assistance. The Fire Department responded to 4,159 alarms in 1991, 16.7 percent more than in 1990, and 42.6 percent of them were false alarms.
But parents, students and elected officials see the city's crime problems in more graphic terms. So far this year three Mount Vernon 16-year- olds -- Andre Frank, Kasiem Merchant and Cleavon Johnson -- were gunned down in street shootings. Police believe the shootings were committed by other teen-agers.
Mayor Blackwood initiated a gun amnesty program, but only four weapons were turned in. A crisis intervention center was established in the high school, where students had said gun possession was widespread.
Youngsters attending a rally at the high school on March 31, in the aftermath of the shootings, criticized the city for spending millions of dollars for a new police and court building while refusing to invest in recreational programs.
Mayor Blackwood acknowledged the existence of disruptive students "who don't settle arguments verbally anymore." He said: "People used to settle arguments by fighting -- you'd punch out a guy and that would be the end of it. Now you don't punch him, you shoot him."
Mount Vernon's economic status provides a somewhat rosier picture. Although unemployment, at 8 percent, is at the highest rate since the mid-1970's and nearly twice the 3.7 percent level of 1990, Mayor Blackwood attributes the figure to the recession rather than to local conditions. "A lot of our people work in New York City and therefore suffer the city's problems," he said.
 
Spending Reduced by $770,000
 Meanwhile, the city has pulled in its financial reins in the wake of the recession, approving a 1992 budget that will reduce spending by $770,000. Twenty-five unfilled jobs have been eliminated and appointments of some city officials delayed. Services have not been cut, however, and spending on library books and magazines continues at previous levels.
City employees have been working without contracts since Jan. 1, and the outlook for 1993 is bleak. Residents who stormed City Hall last year demanding a reduction in the proposed 18.9 percent property tax increase, and got city officials to reduce spending, can be expected back this year if property taxes go up again.
There have also been some economic losses: Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports, moved from Mount Vernon to Yonkers recently, and Lillian Vernon Corporation, a national mail order company, announced last month that after 41 years here it plans to move its headquarters to New Rochelle.
But Mayor Blackwood sees economic conditions improving, pointing to a $10 million supermarket that is planned for a five-acre site in a commercial district of south Mount Vernon as well as development of a transportation center in the eastern end of the city.

Despite Continued Cuts, Arts Remain a Priority

BYLINE: By ROBERT SHERMAN

 BODY:
THE recession has taken its toll on the arts. Donations -- personal, corporate and governmental -- are way down, and one organization after another has been forced to cut back operations. Many have gone out of business. On this Memorial Day weekend, however, let us look at the brighter side of the picture, which comes from a nationwide survey prepared for the American Council for the Arts and underwritten by Philip Morris.
The American people, the report said, care about the arts in far greater numbers than one might have supposed. They attend concerts, support artistic training in public schools and are willing, up to a point, to trade higher taxes for government financing of arts programs. 
 The telephone poll, conducted in February by Louis Harris, the public-opinion analyst, questioned 1,500 people over the age of 18 nationwide. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus 3 percent.
"This survey has been conducted in the middle of what the vast majority of Americans feel is one of the deepest recessions that has gripped the country in some time," Mr. Harris said. "It is striking that all regions of the country, all strata of education, all races and all income levels support Federal financing of the arts. The results are clear-cut and decisive, the majorities are significantly high."
Despite all the controversy swirling around the National Endowment for the Arts' support of specific artists and arts programs, the public vote on separating government financing from government control was equally decisive, with nearly 80 percent of the respondents opposed to artistic restrictions.
"These heavy majorities," Mr. Harris said, "spell out a clear-cut mandate for the government that Federal control of the substance of what the artists create should not be a condition of Federal funding."
An even greater number -- more than 90 percent -- felt that the arts should be a required and regular part of the public school curriculum. By a 3-to-1 ratio, the respondents said arts training should be part of the regular school budget; 6 in 10 said the arts were just as important to a youngster as math and science.
Mr. Harris said that it was significant that 8 in 10 adults were convinced that in studying the arts, children can learn skills that can be useful in a job. Thus the arts, viewed as esoteric and even an indulgence by some, "are seen by the vast majority of Americans as a crucial and central experience in education," Mr. Harris said.
In an article last month in the Lincoln Center magazine Stagebill, James Wolfensohn, chairman of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, echoed that sentiment and added a note of urgency. "This is a national responsibility," he wrote. "If we do not infuse the arts into the entire educational experience at all levels, it will be our children -- and ultimately our society -- who will suffer."
The Harris report yields other interesting statistics. Twenty-eight percent of the respondents, for instance, said they play a musical instrument; 17 percent sing in a choir or other vocal group; 35 percent are involved with dance, although that figure may be misleading because the category includes aerobics. Twenty percent listen frequently to classical music on radio or recordings, and another 20 percent said they listen to it every once in a while.
Obviously, these figures are modest compared with those for sporting events or pop music attractions, but they do indicate a deep awareness that children should not be deprived of the higher quality of life that music, painting and literature can bring them. In Westchester, there are many public and private organizations working toward that purpose; but individual support, too, is needed for local orchestras, choirs and chamber ensembles to thrive, as well as for a return to significant music education in school curriculums and making sure children are exposed to music, dance and theater events.
"Taken together," Mr. Harris concluded, "the levels of participation in the arts and commitment to the arts reinforce previous findings."
"To link those who participate and those who attend is a significant issue for the future," he added. "There is an enormous potential here -- in terms of involvement, but even more important in terms of building a constituency. How to bring the two together is a fundamental challenge to the arts community."
A booklet containing highlights of the poll is available for $3 (the complete survey is $20) from the American Council for the Arts, Publications Department, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, New York, N.Y. 10019, or by calling (212) 245-4510.
The Rosenthal Y.M.-Y.W.H.A. of Northern Westchester in Pleasantville and the Hoff-Barthelson Music School of Scarsdale have announced summer programs for school-age youngsters.
In the Y's classrooms, theater, gymnasium and playgrounds, the Summer Center for the Arts plans a variety of experiences for boys and girls in kindergarten through sixth grade, including workshops in songwriting, sculpture, dance, music and more, leading to a Festival Production and Art Show in the final week of the program. The number to call for more details is 741-0333.
For Hoff-Barthelson, the Summer Arts Program enters its 20th year with a new option for afternoon sports at Concordia College in Bronxville. The mornings, however, will be filled with music at the school, with classes in singing, eurythmics and sight reading, individual lessons on any instrument and group performance opportunities in orchestral, choral, wind and jazz ensembles. The telephone number at Hoff-Barthelson is 723-1169.

BIKING FOR DIABETES
 About 500 bicyclists are expected to take part in the Tour de Cure next Sunday, sponsored by the Lower Hudson Valley Chapter of the American Diabetes Association. Riders may choose from three scenic courses of 25, 50 or 100 kilometers, all beginning and ending at the Stouffer Hotel in Harrison.
Registration at $25 will begin at 6:30 A.M., and cycling will start at 8 A.M. Each rider will be required to have a minimum of $50 in pledges, and winners will receive merchandise from Sharper Image or, as a grand prize, a four-day cruise for two to the Bahamas. 
 All the routes will be monitored by marshals and served by volunteers at rest stops and water stops. At the finish line all riders will be treated to food, drink and entertainment.
Proceeds will be used for research projects, programs and services of the American Diabetes Association. The number to call for more information or a registration packet is 345-9300.
 
ART QUILTS ON DISPLAY
 Ann Trusty began making quilts as an art form 20 years ago. Since then she has developed skills that involve more than the piecing together of store-bought fabric. She dyes her own materials, silk-screens her own prints, paints fabric by hand and has perfected a series of complex stitches.
Her work has been exhibited in Europe, Japan and throughout the United States, and a collection of her quilts will be on display in the Art Workshop Gallery at the Westchester County Center in White Plains from Thursday through June 25.
She will present a lecture and seminar on the art quilt on Friday in the Art Workshop. The talk will begin at 9:30 A.M. and end at 11:30 A.M. Those who participate in the seminar and hands-on workshop may remain until 3:30 P.M. Admission to the lecture will be $10; the lecture and seminar will cost $36.
Visiting hours at the gallery are 10 A.M. to 8:30 P.M. Monday through Thursday, 10 A.M. to 3:45 P.M. Friday and 10 A.M. to noon Saturday. The number to call for more information or to register for the seminar-workshop is 684-0094.
 
FROM THE RAIN FOREST
 A replica of a herbal healer's house, typical of those in the world's rain forests, replete with tools and equipment for making medicines from plants, is part of an exhibit opening Saturday at the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx.
The display, "Green Treasures: Useful Plants of the Tropical Rain Forest," will acquaint visitors with the research done by the botanical garden's scientists in Belize, Central America, since the late 1980's.
Examples of more than 100 medicinally useful plants will be bedded in the lush vegetation surrounding the healer's house. Among them are cowfoot, used as an anti-swelling agent; avocado, whose leaves are effective in treating coughs, and annatto, a food coloring and a treatment for fever.
Herbal healers of Belize assisted Dr. Michael J. Balick, director of the garden's Institute of Economic Botany, and Prof. Robert Mendelsohn of Yale University in their research on harvesting medicinal plants in rain forests. The findings showed that such harvests yield rich rewards economically as well as scientifically, exceeding revenues from clear-cutting forests or from cultivation. Both practices have led to widespread loss of species, deforestation and environmental damage.
The exhibition will run through Oct. 25 on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. and weekends and Monday holidays from 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. Admission is $3, $2 for children age 6 to 16, students and people 65 and older. Children under 6 are admitted free, and admission is free to everyone on Saturdays from 10 A.M. to noon. The number to call for directions or more information is (212) 220-8777.
 
ANTIQUES APPRAISALS
 For a $15 donation to the Pound Ridge Arts and Antiques Appraisal Committee, visitors to the first Pound Ridge Arts and Antiques Appraisal Day and Festival on Saturday may have two items appraised by an expert from Sotheby's. They will also become contributors to the Pound Ridge Historical Society and Museum.
The festival will be held in the Scott's Corners business district in Pound Ridge from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M.
Appointments must be made with a Sotheby expert in advance by calling 764-4949 or 764-1247, specifying the type of object to be appraised -- furniture, decorative pieces, accessories, paintings, prints, jewelry, silver, crystal or china. Anything too large to carry may be appraised from a recent photograph.
Sotheby's appraisers and a number of skilled artisans will be stationed in various antique and arts shops. Among demonstrations will be restoration of antique furniture, brass and bronze, lacquering, restoration of oil paintings, trompe l'oeil and faux finish painting techniques, gilding and restoration of antique lamps and chandeliers.
A shopping guide, walking map and listing of the day's events will be available at the information booth in front of the Arts Center Building on Westchester Avenue (Route 124). More information may be obtained by calling 764-4477.
 
EGG TEMPERA SHOW
 Egg tempera is a medium seldom used by modern artists, with the notable exception of Paul Cadmus, because the process is extremely time consuming and considered somewhat old-fashioned.
Adrienne Riso apparently is undaunted by the required meticulousness and patience employed by Renaissance painters in their widespread use of egg tempera. She has completed a series of paintings called "Human Nature," on view at the Mamaroneck Artists Guild, which echo the detailed genre paintings of centuries ago, telling stories and recording important family events.
A companion exhibition of natural vine basketry and sculpture by Diane Heiman carries out the theme of the human form in semi-abstract and naturalistic techniques.
The guild, at 2120 Post Road in Larchmont, is open Monday through Saturday from noon to 4 P.M. A reception for the two artists will be held on Saturday from 2 to 4 P.M., and the exhibition will remain through June 14.
 
FOLK MUSIC IN PAWLING
 Walt Michael & Company will be on stage at the Towne Crier Cafe in Pawling tonight at 8:30, featuring Evan Stover and Frank Orsini on fiddles and Tom Wetmore playing string bass.
Mr. Michael, a folk and bluegrass virtuoso, is an extraordinary technician on the hammered dulcimer and a formidable singer and guitarist. Performing as a quartet, the ensemble will present a program of southern Appalachian, Celtic, Gospel and original compositions.
The admission fee is $12.50. The cafe is at 62 Route 22. The number to call for reservations is 855-1300.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
The Very Careful British Market

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
Is the British stock market too efficient? That might seem an odd notion, since the market took off after the Conservative Party victory in national elections on April 9. The Financial Times index of 100 leading stocks is up 13.5 percent and has set new highs, closing at 2,715.0 on Friday.
Moreover, many analysts contend that the market will rise even more, making it a good bet even after the 322 point rally so far. Paul Walton, the British strategist at James Capel Inc. in London, is so bullish he thinks the F.T. 100 can reach 3,000 by the end of the year and even 3,500 by mid-1993. Goldman Sachs in London also sees it at 3,000 by the end of the year. 
 But some investors are not sharing in the enthusiasm, and this is where the efficient market question enters. Teton Partners in Boston, a hedge fund manager that takes both long and short positions in stocks, thinks the British market is too efficient because too many stocks are followed by too many analysts and investors. This makes it very difficult to find bargains. So Teton prefers mostly looking elsewhere.
"Britain is never really on the top of our list," said Susan Boland, the Teton partner who covers Britain. "It is harder for us to find stuff that everyone else has not picked over. I prefer the Continent. The markets are much less efficiently researched."
In one sense, nothing has changed since the British elections -- the Conservatives, led by Prime Minister John Major, remain in power. But that was a surprise. As election day approached, the City had moved toward the conclusion that there would be a hung Parliament, with no clear victory for either Labor or the Conservatives.
In the detailed outlooks that many investment firms produced then, the Conservative victory scenario, although downgraded as a possibility, predicted an immediate rally and forecast that the F.T. 100 would rise to 3,000 by the end of the year.
Developments in the rest of Europe have added to the bullish fervor since then. In France, for example, the Socialists have dumped one prime minister and suffered setbacks in regional elections. The Italian Parliament cannot agree on choosing the new president needed to begin the process of forming a new government because the ruling coalition was rebuffed in recent elections.
Germany has been troubled by public workers' strikes and concerns about the stability of the coalition led by the chancellor, Helmut Kohl. Some of these fears receded after surprise union agreements in the metalworking and construction industries early last week and two more agreements for shopworkers and printers on Friday. This sent the Dax index in Frankfurt up more than 4.5 percent last week, though the political problems still remain.
All this seems to mean that Britain, the island, is one spot with political stability. There can be five years of a Conservative Government before another election. Moreover, the pound has demonstrated a reassuring stability to foreign investors since its entry into the European Monetary System. So Britain is increasingly seen as a magnet for large institutional investors and portfolio managers looking for Europe's best bets.
But at Teton Partners in Boston, led by George Noble and Tom Niedermeyer, the British market's magnetism does not have the same attraction.
Ms. Boland has only a few stocks in Britain. Two of her picks are small companies that are not in the center of the blue chip bull's-eye. One is Kwik-Fit, a small company that should benefit from new regulations requiring thicker treads on tires in Britain. The company sells tires and has fast repair muffler outlets.
In the Institutional Brokers Estimate System, which follows earnings projections on companies around the world, the forecasts for Kwik-Fit's earnings are for a rise of 13.3 percent in the fiscal year ending next February. And there is close agreement among the individual analysts on this outlook. Since the election, Kwik-Fit is up 27.6 percent.
Ms. Boland's second company -- of those she would name -- is a small homebuilder in southeast England, Berkeley Group, which will get a lift from the turnaround in the British economy that appears to be under way. She said Berkeley's owner has a lot of cash on hand because he stopped building near the top of the housing market.
The estimate system's median forecast for Berkeley Group earnings in the fiscal year ending next April is for a 69 percent increase. While there is a wide variation in the individual projections of analysts, they are all up substantially on Berkeley, except one, which shows no increase. Since the election Berkeley has risen 55.7 percent.
"We are willing to put the time in to do the homework," Ms. Boland said of what might seem obscure picks. "If you are willing to stretch your horizons a bit, you can make money."
But Ms. Boland also is not loath to chase after some of the biggies -- sometimes. In this case, the stock is Powergen, a utility listed in the F.T. 100. "We will still buy the big ones when they look like they are being undervalued in the market," she said. But she sold Powergen in the past week. "We owned it for a while because utilities were cheap before the election. But it has done its thing."
That's the efficient market for you.

HEADLINE: Making a Difference;
Hewlett Tries Some Mainframe Magic

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
The list of minicomputer manufacturers that have entered the mainframe market is a short one, and with good reason: most that have tried have failed. Undaunted, the Hewlett-Packard Company announced its first mainframe-class machines last week.
Lewis E. Platt, Hewlett-Packard's executive vice president and general manager of the computer systems organization, said the new machines offered performance comparable to an I.B.M. 3090, but for one-tenth the cost and at one-tenth the size. The machines achieve this performance breakthrough with the use of reduced-instruction-set computing, or RISC, which speeds things up by relegating many common tasks to software. 
 "RISC technology has allowed us to do some very compelling things," said Mr. Platt, who is 51 and considered a leading candidate to succeed John A. Young as chief executive at the company, which is based in Palo Alto, Calif.
Mr. Platt said the new machines were aimed primarily at traditional mainframe customers who are considering "downsizing," industry jargon for moving applications to smaller, more cost-effective computers.
According to Dataquest Inc., a market research firm in San Jose, Calif., more than 46 percent of mainframe users are considering downsizing. Because the new machines can run all the software written for Hewlett-Packard minicomputers and work stations, current customers are also a major market opportunity, Mr. Platt said.
That software base is a significant reason that Hewlett-Packard can succeed where others failed, Mr. Platt said. The Digital Equipment Corporation "made a big mistake because it rolled out a piece of hot hardware, but there was no networking capability, no software," he said.
Priced from about $335,000 to $925,000, the new computers will begin to be shipped in August. Contrasted with a room-filling, liquid-cooled mainframe, the Hewlett-Packard machines are about the size of a refrigerator and are air-cooled. Companies that have already begun moving applications from mainframes to Hewlett-Packard's machines include 3M, GTE Telephone Operations and ITT Sheraton.

HEADLINE: Wall Street;
Congress Stops, the Dow Goes Up

BYLINE: By Diana B. Henriques

 BODY:
In today's quiz, the answer is: "A place full of greedy, selfish people who are oblivious to the damage they inflict on the real world." The correct question is: a.) How would an investment banker define Congress?, b.) How would a legislator describe Wall Street?, or c.) Both of the above.
Unfortunately, you should choose "c." Now that the cold war is over, the world offers few ideological divisions as wide or as deep as the one that yawns between the nation's capital and the nation's marketplace. 
 At Washington dinner tables, legislators sneer at overpaid investment bankers rushing off in limousines to do deals that will put people out of work. In Wall Street bars, any query about Congress produces angry war stories about profits lost and deals killed by legislative bungling.
One such story is told by Eric Singer, an investment banker with Gerard Klauer Mattison & Company, a New York financial boutique known for its in-house research. On Oct. 19, 1987, as Mr. Singer was trying to negotiate a lucrative corporate acquisition, the target company's owner sensibly walked out rather than sell in the middle of a panic -- a panic Mr. Singer blames on Congressional proposals to change the tax treatment of interest costs in corporate takeovers.
But Mr. Singer has done more than gripe about how Congress hurts Wall Street. He has researched it, comparing stock market performance and legislative activity from V-J Day 1945 to the end of 1991. His conclusion: The stock market performs better when Congress is not in session.
Historians generally credit Gideon J. Tucker, a New York surrogate in the 1860's, with the observation that "no man's life, liberty or property are safe while the legislature is in session." But Mr. Singer's study suggests that one's portfolio is in peril as well. He found that, between mid-1945 and the end of 1991, the gain in the Dow Jones industrial average in the periods when both houses of Congress were closed was 17 times as great as when both houses were open.
For the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, the results were less dramatic but still notable. Mr. Singer found that the increase in the S.&P.-500 index while Congress was closed was almost four times as great as when Congress was open.
Last year was a case in point. The Dow gained 558.16 points between Dec. 31, 1990 and Dec. 31, 1992. But Mr. Singer calculates that 492.17 of those points were added while at least one house of Congress was closed, and 421.27 points were gained while both houses were closed. Only 65.9 points were gained while both houses were in session.
Over time, the Senate has been somewhat kinder to the market than the House, said Mr. Singer. "But when both the House and the Senate are closed is the best time for the market," he added. Indeed, he suggested -- not entirely in jest -- that a profitable investment strategy would be to buy S.& P. futures when Congress shuts down and sell them when it opens again.
Of course, rather than Congressional activity causing weak markets, it may be the other way around. After all, when the national economy is troubled, lawmakers might feel obliged to stick close to their desks. Similarly, when the market is strong, legislators are probably more likely to leave well enough alone, using the time to do a little campaigning among their constituents.
But with those caveats, several Wall Street veterans who have served inside the Beltway found it quite understandable that Wall Street might cringe whenever Congress springs into action. "Washington basically doesn't understand economics," said Mark Melcher, director of Washington research for Prudential Securities. "So the typical lawmaker views the markets not as one of the country's greatest assets, a place where capital is honestly priced, but as a gambling institution, where a lot of fat cats are playing sophisticated games. Their ignorance on the importance of the markets is pretty profound."
On the other hand, he noted, "Wall Street is often very naive about how this town works, too." As a result, when it comes to distinguishing a genuine threat from a legislator's random musings, Wall Street may panic first and ask questions later.
Mr. Singer acknowledged that Wall Street might be too quick to react when Congress indulges in its habit of "negotiating in the newspapers." But he argued that the market's skittishness is the only logical response to decades of disastrous legislative initiatives, dating back at least to the Smoot-Hawley tariffs that helped usher in the Depression. "The only smart thing to do is be very cautious when Congress is in session, because you never know what they'll come up with next," he said.
Mr. Singer's argument drew a bemused nod of recognition from J. Chester Johnson, a Treasury Department official in the Carter Admininstration and now the head of Government Finance Associates, a public finance advisory firm in New York. The enmity between market-maker and lawmaker has grown so deep, he said, "that I'm not very optimistic that there will ever be a rapprochement." He added, "And frankly, I'm not sure there should be."
However upsetting this public-private tension is to the markets, he continued, it may be just what the country needs to stay on an even keel. "Wall Street's hostility toward Congress puts pressure on Washington to be less facile about reaching into its citizens' pockets," Mr. Johnson said. "And Washington's hostility puts pressure on Wall Street to be a little more sensitive to the social needs and the public agenda. So each side helps restrain the worst tendencies in the other."
Mr. Melcher of Prudential agreed that a truce between Wall Street and Washington was unlikely, even if peace might be reassuring to the market. "These are antagonistic animals," he said. "And as Woody Allen would say, the lion may lie down with the lamb, but the lamb won't get much sleep."

HEADLINE: The Executive Computer;
More Home Workers and More Machines in Their Offices

BYLINE: By Peter H. Lewis

 BODY:
Talked on the phone recently with the chief executive of a small prosperous company? You may never have suspected that the calm, assured voice at the other end belonged to a man in his underwear, interrupted while searching under the desk for an escaped hamster.
Ah, the joys of the home office. 
 While most home office do not have hamsters, the latest figures from the Link Resources Corporation, a market research company in New York, show that most do have personal computers. For the first time, the percentage of home offices that use a computer has topped 50 percent.
"I see it as a significant milestone," said Thomas E. Miller, a vice president at Link Resources. Mr. Miller said that final numbers from his company's 1991 work-at-home survey were being tabulated but that more than 39 million people appeared to have done all or part of their paid work at home last year.
Put those two calculations together and 20 million people are using personal computers at home to do some or all of their paid work -- running a primary or secondary business, working at home a day or two each month, or simply catching up on correspondence at night or on weekends.
One subset of home office workers is called "corporate home workers," people on the payroll of a company outside their home, and nearly 60 percent of them use a computer, said Mr. Miller, who is also an example of this. He works from his home in upstate New York and "commutes" to the city electronically.
Because of the recession, the heady growth in the number of home offices appears to have slowed, Mr. Miller said, but the adoption of computers and other information technologies in those offices is increasing. People are relying more on telephones, modems, facsimile machines and scanners as well as computers to help them with their jobs.
Beyond the mere statistics, the broader message is that the personal computer has become a standard tool in even the smallest businesses in America. The Small Business Administration says these smallest businesses -- all the way down to one-person pet-sitting services, window washers, gardening consultants and moonlight word processors -- collectively generate as much of the country's gross national product as the 500 largest multinational corporations.
And businesses that do not use computers are officially in the minority for the first time.
"It is a milestone, and it was a long time in coming," said Paul Edwards, who with his wife, Sarah Edwards, has written several books and lectured widely on the work-at-home phenomenon. "In the big- and small-business sector it was passed quickly, but it was more slow to develop in the home. It is a recognition that the computer, as an extension of the brain, has become as indispensible to operating a business as the telephone is as an extension of our voices."
"People who are not computerizing are not able to compete as well," said Sarah Edwards. "They're struggling, or just hanging on."
The Edwardses are authors of "The Best Home Businesses for the 90's" and "Making It On Your Own" (each $10.95, from Tarcher Books, a division of Putnam Publishing Group of New York) cited the recent example of a woman who ran a bookkeeping service from her home.
The message for any business, Paul Edwards said, "is that personal computers are now integral as opposed to supplemental," adding: "Now it's no longer a matter of gaining a competitive edge. It's a matter of keeping up."
In the electronic forums that on-line information services provide, home office and small business workers are asking a lot of questions. Many home office workers rely on these forums for their technical information, because they do not have the technical support staffs that are common in larger businesses.
"I need to know how much RAM my system has," writes Fran, of Margate, Fla., in the home business forum on Prodigy Information Services. "Also, where do I find how much MG I have?" She gets replies from a self-described "old lady" named Jane; Mark in Norman, Okla., and others who guess that Fran means megabytes of disk storage space rather than monosodium glutamate or machine guns. They tell Fran to use the DOS CHKDSK and MEM commands.
"About 35 percent of our members work at home," said Brian Ek, a spokesman for Prodigy Information Services Inc. of White Plains, which is a joint venture of the International Business Machines Corporation and Sears, Roebuck & Company.
David, in contrast, asks other musicians for more technical advice. "I have a Roland CM-32L synthesizer with the MPU IMC card. When I try to initialize the Win 3.1 driver for MPU-401 . . ."
Frank uses the computer to ask where he can get more information about a balloon-decorating business. Michael asks about the availability of facsimile machines for use in his car and gets replies from across the country. Another Michael uses his computer to inquire about starting a mobile oil-change business for people who don't have time to wait at the 10-minute lube shops. A baseball-card collector in Fort Worth asks about the profitability of opening a sports card shop and receives some rather bleak replies along with a report on the return-on-investment of 1989 Ken Griffey Jr. rookie cards ($2 to $3 then, now $45 each).
The recession and subsequent layoffs of thousands of mid-level business managers nationwide has changed the dynamics of new home office ventures, Mr. Miller of Link and the Edwardses agreed. Many executives who lost their jobs are starting home-based businesses, using computers and other information technologies to re-create their former office environment.
Rapidly falling prices, as well as career decisions, are driving computers deeper into the home office.
"When I started in this field in 1983, I paid nearly $5,000 for a fully loaded Apple II," Mr. Miller said, chuckling at the thought. Today, $5,000 will equip a home office with a computer many times more powerful than the Apple II, along with software, a couple of telephones, an answering machine, a fax machine, a modem and other equipment -- with enough left over for a nice desk and lamp.

HEADLINE: At Work;
Is the American City Obsolete?

BYLINE: By BARBARA PRESLEY NOBLE

 BODY:
There seems to be very little good news coming out of America's cities these days. First, a flood in Chicago, then fire in Los Angeles, events that seemed to bring the prophecy from an old slave song -- "God gave Noah the rainbow sign, no more water, the fire next time" -- perilously close to reality. Cities, some social critics contend, are obsolete -- vestigial remnants of an era earlier in this century when proximity was critical to commerce. New York, for example, was a hub through which money and people, immigrants, for example, were sped into the flourishing national economy.
At the very least, goes the argument, cities are now a reminder that the country has lost its edge in manufacturing and has been unable to solve the problems of structural poverty. Urban jobs have flowed offshore and to places with more enticing, dependable infrastructure. The future is in a white-collar service economy that can be conducted in so-called "edge cities" far from an urban core.
 
 Whenever he hears another knell sounded on behalf of the late-20th-century American city, Elliott Sclar, professor of urban planning at Columbia University, tends to want to reach up and grab the clapper. "If you look at societies through history, when they are growing and dynamic, their cities are vital and dynamic," he said in an interview last week. "In the Dark Ages, cities were walled and people were fearful." Professor Sclar sees ominous signs in what he regards as the abandonment of the cities, both literally and in the American imagination. "In the future, people may look back at us and see a fearful society that is closing down," he said.
If Professor Sclar were philosopher-king, he would put cities in the center, not of a social agenda, but of an economic and industrial agenda. Late last year, he and two colleagues, Joseph Persky, an economist at the University of Illinois, and Wim Wiewel, the director of the Center for Urban Economic Development at Illinois, posed the question "Does America Need Cities?" in a report for the Economic Policy Institute. In that report and in an update written by Professors Persky and Wiewel two weeks ago as Los Angeles and the rest of the nation cooled off, they answered the question with an impassioned affirmative.
"The cities of the nation, for all of their social problems, play host to the country's most productive activities," the authors wrote, flinging a pot of paint in the face of conventional wisdom that "productive activity" is most profitable far from the demimonde of, say, Manhattan, Chicago or San Francisco.
"Right now we are writing off 20 to 25 percent of our population and 50 percent of our most valuable real estate," said Professor Persky of the trend toward situating industry a long freeway or turnpike ride away from city centers. "That's just a wastefulness we can't afford as a society."
The utility of the traditional city lies in what the authors call "agglomeration," the concentration of a high-density population of workers with diverse, leading-edge specializations. Corporations can move their routine "back office" chores out into the countryside where employees do a good job at less pay than in the city. "But the work force in the command and planning part of a corporation doesn't have routine work to do," Professor Sclar said. "They have to evaluate and analyze information and make decisions."
Telecommunications and technology like modems and fax machines are never likely to replace the face-to-face encounter. Fortunes can rise and fall on the simple business lunch. "It's no accident that financial firms don't leave the city," Professor Sclar said. "They lend billions of dollars, and they do it almost intuitively. Some things involve being together and making judgments."
The authors believe the nation is at a crossroads in allocating its resources. As the edge cities mature into settled population centers, they have the same infrastructural needs as the older cities, which will require outlays for roads, sewers, school systems, public transportation and other necessities of life. The growth of edge cities is already beginning to slow as they reach the limits of their usefulness as isolated centers of industry. "They are looking for a more urban, high-density base over the next 10 to 15 years," Professor Persky said. "Those areas will continue to grow, and we will have to increase connections between them. That will be expensive."
The vast expenditures necessary to diversify the edge could go to helping the center cities hold. The authors don't expect much help from the current troika of Presidential candidates. America's deep ambivalence about its urban areas could too easily render any truly pro-city politician obsolete.
 
 
 
COLLEGE EDUCATION NOT REQUIRED
 The argument raised most frequently against trying to revive cities is the complexity of remedies needed. Concern is endemic among executives that young people in general and big-city young people in particular are poorly prepared for the demands of work in the 21st century.
One of the authors of a report arguing in favor of salvaging the cities questions the accepted wisdom that college degrees will become prerequisites for even modest entry-level employment. "It's as if people have accepted the notion that high school can be written off," said Joseph Persky, an economist, "that people either go to college or drop out of high school." Professor Persky says the key question is not how long people go to school but what they learn. "There's no reason someone coming out of high school could not have the skills to become a skilled technician," he said. "We are getting an overcredentialed work force."
An educational revolution is not necessary, Professor Persky argues: "Basic literacy skills, basic math and a little awareness of the world. That's not too much to ask."

HEADLINE: An Alternative to Seawolf

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Washington helpless? Hardly. The problem in Washington is not a lack of funds but a lack of imagination throughout the system, which includes both political parties. 
 Why is it that we can find $300 billion for defense but nothing for substantial manufacturing training in civilian production? Surely Government subsidies now given out as military contracts to build such products as Seawolf submarines could be devised to go to the same companies in the same communities to build other more useful products. High-speed rail transportation systems, commuter transportation, airport improvement, civilian aircraft and the like all have real value and can serve multiple purposes in regenerating our inner cities as well as our national economy.
Why is it that McDonnell Douglas must go to Taiwan for capital when the United States needs its production capabilities and may someday need its military production capabilities? Why not a direct Government program to produce civilian transport that will keep it here and prosperous?
Washington has the money, the country has the need and it is absurd to suggest that Washington is helpless in the face of this type of challenge. No one in either party appears to have spent any time thinking about how to make the transition from a war economy (albeit mostly cold war) to a peace economy. Why not encourage the military industry to become the peace industry?

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
The Frozen President

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

 BODY:
Something has happened to President Bush. In recent weeks and months he has ducked and vacillated on issues, seemingly unwilling to take decisive positions, unable to lead. It is as if he were immobilized.
His supporters have noticed. They are more and more openly expressing concern, discontent, bewilderment at his performance. They are starting to look elsewhere for leadership. 
 The most striking example of his indecisiveness, and very likely the most damaging to Mr. Bush, has been his response to the jury verdict and riots in Los Angeles. After the verdict he urged people to await a nonexistent "appeals process." Since then he has alternated between calls for law and order and sympathetic talk about urban needs.
The country urgently wanted leadership after Los Angeles: a sense of direction, a sense of hope. President Bush temporized, heard conflicting ideas from his advisers, came up with a tired little package of old proposals. There has been no sense of the White House as a beacon in hard times.
But the phenomenon is not limited to domestic issues. A President who made his mark in foreign affairs and used to revel in taking strong stands abroad has become weak and indecisive there, too.
Look at Yugoslavia. The Persian Gulf war is only a little more than a year old. Could any of us have imagined then that George Bush would be whimperingly unable to respond to brutal aggression by a Serbian Communist? That he and his foreign-policy aides would stand mute while the Serbs mimicked Nazi tactics by pulling non-Serbians out of their homes in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the cause of "ethnic purification"?
The question of help to post-Communist Russia is another puzzling example. Mr. Bush came forward with no proposals to help save the budding Russian democracy from economic disaster until he was shamed into doing something by former President Nixon.
Then there was his trip to Japan. He first canceled it so he could look more like a domestic President. Then in January he went, and the proclaimed supporter of free trade used the trip to act as a Willy Loman for U.S. auto manufacturers.
The pattern reached a comic height last week in the incident of Dan Quayle and Murphy Brown. The Vice President attacked the TV character for "mocking the importance of fathers by bearing a child and calling it 'just another life style choice.' " This threw Mr. Bush and the White House into a tizzy.
"I don't know what it's about," Mr. Bush said. "Where's Marlin on this?"
Marlin Fitzwater, his spokesman, first condemned "the glorification of the life of an unwed mother." A few minutes later he corrected himself, praising Murphy Brown's "pro-life values." The President himself came out strongly for "families with a mother and father."
What is going on? The one thing that George Bush has not been during most of his life is reluctant to act or decide.
He was the youngest Navy pilot in World War II, a gung-ho character. As President he ordered the invasion of Panama: an adventure that did not help Panama's problems of drugs and poverty, as it turned out, but that was surely bold. And then there was the war on Iraq.
In personal style, too, Mr. Bush is the opposite of idle. He is Mr. Kinetic, constantly in motion, a man whose idea of a restful seaside holiday is to zoom around in a noisy speedboat.
How, then, can we explain the immobilism that has crept over George Bush the President? I think the reason is politics: politics of a particular kind.
In this election year Mr. Bush is trying to avoid doing things that may upset people. He is trying to finesse hard issues.
Thus he tries to mollify the doctors and scientists who want to use fetal tissue as it is used in every other country, to cure human diseases, without roiling the anti-abortionists. He proposes a fetal-tissue bank that will be forbidden to benefit from voluntary abortions -- and hence will be useless.
The whole strategy, if that is what it is, is useless. The country will not wait for action until November. The world will not wait. And the voters will not wait.

HEADLINE: U.S. Acts the Spoiler in Global Climate Talks

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Last week delegates from 143 countries reached tentative accord on a Framework Convention on Climate Change after marathon debates during their final negotiating session at the United Nations in New York.
As it stands, the convention requires that industrialized countries look to "return by the end of the present decade to earlier levels of anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases" but includes no specific reductions or timetable. While the convention has been criticized as being too weak, a second criticism must be directed not to the result but to the process. 
 The group began the negotiating process more than 15 months ago, pursuant to a United Nations resolution. During the third session, held in September 1991, the European Community surprised many delegates by endorsing the specific commitment of stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000. Japan, Australia, Canada and the Scandinavian countries soon followed suit. Virtually all developed countries also supported the proposal. Only the United States stood its ground, and the stalemate lasted through the next two sessions.
Shortly before the start of the final session, the chairman of the group, Jean Ripert of France, consulted with a handful of member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, including the United States and Britain, to develop language substantially the same as that adopted last week. During the session Mr. Ripert in essence admitted he had bowed to the U.S. position so that the U.S. would be a party to the proposed convention.
While practical, Mr. Ripert's action lacked courage. Many arguments exist for structuring a treaty palatable to the United States. As both the world's largest greenhouse-gas emitter and the world's deepest pocket, the U.S. must be a party to make the treaty meaningful, so the argument goes. Even without the United States, however, the treaty's effectiveness might not have suffered greatly. Furthermore, as industrialized countries party to the convention develop new energy-saving technology, U.S. companies would be obliged to keep pace with their foreign competitors. In bowing to the U.S., Mr. Ripert sacrificed the willingness of many for the obstinacy of one.
It is unfortunate for the other delegates, the negotiating process and the global environment that the treaty to be signed at the Earth Summit next month in Rio de Janeiro is the anti
climactic (and anti-climatic) result of the long, arduous negotiations that preceded it.

HEADLINE: L.A. Police Were Tried by a Jury of Their Peers

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I am writing to correct a small but critical error that continues to appear in discussions concerning recent events in Los Angeles. 
 "The Jury Said, 'I'm White, and You're Wrong' " (letter, May 10) asks the rhetorical question, "White suburban juries as peers of black urban citizens? By what measure are they peers?" By the same measure, apparently, the writer himself employs: race and economy.
What he and others fail to note is that the jury in question was hearing the case against four white Los Angeles police officers; they were not hearing a case against Rodney King, who never appeared in court. If we judge parity by race and economy (class), then the Los Angeles police officers most certainly were tried by a jury of their peers.
On the one hand, this "error" should be understood as the legitimate call for justice for Rodney King that it is. The tendency to describe the jury as "non-peers" reveals a strong desire that his beating be seen for what it was, a racist attack. It reveals the concern that it be seen from the perspective of the African-American community, which experiences the justice system quite differently from whites.
However, the deeper question -- What is a peer? -- continues to be answered in terms of race by both blacks and whites. We must understand, though, that while the answer may be similar, the rationale is much different for whites than it is for blacks. And that a "better" answer waits on a more fundamental change in how we as a society understand and regard racial differences.

HEADLINE: An Election-Year Amendment;
Would the Budget Deficit Be Constitution-Proof?

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE proposed constitutional amendment to balance the budget is in many ways a gamble, and the debate about it boils down to whether the gamble is worth taking.
Senator Paul Simon, the Illinois Democrat who is the chief sponsor of the leading proposal, says that only something as weighty as a constitutional amendment can force the White House and Congress to get serious about eliminating the deficit. Since the President and Congress must swear to uphold the Constitution, he asserts that they would not dare shirk their duty to implement a new amendment. 
 But opponents say the proposed amendment is a gamble that will not pay off. They argue that there is no way the amendment, well-intentioned as it may be, will force the White House and Congress to take the painful, possibly traumatic, steps needed to erase the deficit. Convinced that such an amendment will prove as worthless as an overdrawn check on the House Bank, opponents say it would be an insult to the hallowed Constitution to add an amendment on the mere hope that it might prove effective.
Mr. Simon's amendment would require the President to propose a balanced budget to Congress, which could waive the requirement with a 60 percent vote in each house or in the event of war. The Bush Administration has repeatedly backed a balanced budget amendment, although conservatives generally prefer a version offered by Senator Robert W. Kasten Jr., Republican of Wisconsin. His version, which is given less chance of passing, would require a 60 percent vote in each house to increase taxes.
Mr. Simon said an amendment would stop Congress and the President from burdening future generations with debt. "Right now we don't have to do anything except build up an enormous tab that we won't be around to have to pay," he said. The deficit is expected to soar to over $350 billion this year.
Mr. Simon likes to point out that several prominent economists who opposed such an amendment in the mid-1980's now support it. Admitting that the amendment is heavy-handed, these economists have still seized upon it in the desperate hope that it might work where nothing else has.
 
A Convert Explains
 "I used to think it was unnecessary," said Barry Bosworth, a Carter Administration economics official who is a fellow at the Brookings Institution. "But deficits have now gone on for a decade and a half. We may need some institutional change because we have this continual practice of a government split between Republicans and Democrats, and no one is taking any responsibility for the deficits."
He fears that lawmakers and the public fail to recognize how harsh the steps would be.
Robert Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office, laid that out very clearly in recent testimony. One formula to balance the budget by 1997, he said, would be to raise overall taxes by 4 percent, cut projected spending on entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security by 3 percent, and cut discretionary programs like Head Start, highways and medical research by 20 percent. If discretionary programs were left alone, he said, taxes could be raised by 7 percent and entitlements cut by 10 percent.
Another package, he suggested, could erase the deficit over 10 years without tax increases: cut the military budget by 40 percent, other discretionary spending by 16 percent, farm payments by 70 percent, veterans benefits by 13 percent, federal retirement programs by 7 percent, programs for the poor by 1 percent and discretionary spending by 16 percent. It would also hold growth in Medicare and Medicaid spending to 10 percent a year, not the projected 12 percent, and index Social Security benefits to rise each year by 1 percent less than inflation.
Knowing how painful these spending cuts would be, he sketched an alternative: raise personal tax rates from 15, 28 and 31 percent, to 16, 30 and 33 percent, respectively; lift the corporate income tax by one point to 35 percent; limit itemized deductions to those in the lowest tax bracket; and place a 5 percent value-added tax on all goods and services except food, housing and medical care.
Mr. Reischauer said a balanced budget is desirable because deficits hold down investment, productivity and growth -- although he said a balanced budget requirement could prolong recessions by preventing countercyclical spending. The problem, he said, has not been getting a consensus for a balanced budget. "Rather, the problem has been agreeing to the specific spending cuts and tax increases that could bring this about. A balanced budget amendment, in and of itself, does little to force such an agreement."
Critics worry that if Congress and the President cannot agree on a balanced budget, the unelected Federal judiciary might be called to intervene and might end up managing the budget.
The morning betting line is that Congress will pass the amendment this year. Opponents say it is a cheap vote. In an election year when incumbents face charges of fiscal irresponsibility, lawmakers will be able to boast that they wholeheartedly support a balanced bud get. But they will not have to take any of the nasty steps to balance it. That will wait until 38 states ratify the amendment.
Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, a Maryland Democrat opposed to the amendment, hasn't given up hope. "As people begin to see things more clearly, they will begin to understand more of the amendment's implications."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Across Southeast Asia, Awakenings to Democracy

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AN announcer on an army-run television channel in Bangkok tried to explain last week why several hundred thousand Thais were in the streets demanding that an unelected Prime Minister resign. Evildoers, the announcer said, had "planted time bombs in the minds of the people."
Time bombs have indeed been going off with some regularity over the last decade in minds in much of Southeast Asia, but there are more credible causes than "evildoers." In areas of rapid economic growth, political liberalization has not in general kept pace; in other countries, autocratic regimes have thwarted economic growth. 
 So it is not just in Thailand that large groups of people are asking if economic progress will be accompanied by democratic reforms, as supporters of democracy throughout the area grow disdainful of the argument that Asians are somehow different, that they prefer the stability of even corrupt authority over the uncertainties that come with free expression and elections.
In 1986, the Philippines felt the effect of this when its "people power" revolution sent the late President Ferdinand Marcos into exile. In the same year, violence racked Sabah, a Malaysian state where an elected administration was under siege from Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and his dominant political party. Then a short-lived challenge to General Suharto's choice for vice president was mounted in Indonesia, where even military officers were beginning to chafe under the general's virtual presidency-for-life. And in 1988, gentle Burma erupted in rage when the military crushed a pro-democracy movement.
Each time such things happen, Southeast Asians, part of a coalescing community of nations despite their cultural differences, plunge into introspection about what Asians really want. And each time, the answers become clearer. Although the circumstances and settings are different, the aims of popular movements are pretty much the same as in other parts of the world. These people want the right to conduct business in an environment reasonably free of stifling corruption, and they want real power in choosing their leaders.
When middle class Thais joined the ad hoc revolution on Bangkok's streets last weekend, they challenged the assertions made by Southeast Asia's many intolerant governments that order and consensus are more important there than freedom.
 
A Widely Held Notion
 "The popular outrage against Suchinda and demand for democracy indicate that the notion, widely held in Administration circles, that Asians are somehow more comfortable with authoritarianism is utterly false," said Sidney Jones, executive director of the human rights group Asia Watch. "The Thai pro-democracy movement should also send a warning signal to Indonesia and Malaysia, who say that the developed countries focus too much on civil and political rights when the real priority of Asians is economic development."
Not all Southeast Asians argue that the philosophical underpinnings of the region dictate that societies will be essentially passive. When tensions were rising in Singapore a few years ago, the Confucian scholar Wu Teh Yao said in an interview that individualism may not rank high in his philosophical system, but that this did not mean an acceptance of authoritarianism, especially amid prosperity. "In all human societies, once the tummy is full, the mind begins to think," he said. "So whoever is going to rule, even in Japan or China, will have to pay attention to the people's needs and wishes."
The argument that there is a Southeast Asian way of interpreting democracy is another matter, and it has some validity -- as shown last week by the longing of the Thai people for King Bhumibol Adulyadej to intervene in the crisis to calm it. He did so a manner rich in symbolism, making the antagonists kneel at his feet. The concept of a ruler acting in the best interests of the people has been part of political life from Vietnam to Java. There is also a genuine desire for consensus and a talent for smoothing away potential clashes. But big problems arise when these natural or traditional instincts are appropriated by politicians or military strongmen and twisted to justify their unwillingness to allow pluralism to develop.
Evelyn Colbert, a former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Asia and the Pacific, said in an interview last week that she was struck by trends in the Philippine election. "The influence of the church on people's voting patterns has been much less than one might have expected," she said. Also, she noted, "in both the Philippines and Thailand, the issue of corruption has been very potent politically."
Ms. Colbert added that success by the Thais in forcing the military-dominated government to make concessions "in some constructive way" would encourage democrats in Burma to continue their campaign.
 
A Jolt to Neighbors
 James Clad, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said: "What happened in Thailand has jolted Indonesia and the region far more than the Philippine revolt in 1986, far more than Burma's savagely repressed riots." The Philippines and Burma "were seen as places that were failing in many ways," he said in a telephone interview from Singapore. "Thailand is different. It was a place that had everything going for it."
In Indonesia, where the military has wielded great political influence since independence in 1949, Mr. Suharto has been in power with army backing since 1965; now word has slipped out in Jakarta that he will more than likely seek another five-year term next year, after parliamentary elections choose his indirect electors in June. Many Indonesians are tired of this closed system, though, and several parties have begun to explore ways of pushing the limits of the carefully controlled process.
In Indochina, the prospects for democracy seem more distant; it is hard to know what odds to give the United Nations' efforts to build representative democracy in Cambodia, and Vietnam is fighting to keep Communism alive. In Vietnam, in fact, what one hears from the leadership has a familiar ring: that Asians are simply not enamored of messy multiparty political systems.

HEADLINE: Federal Environmental Oversight Is Limited;
The Oil Industry Likes to Keep Regulation Close to Home

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO

DATELINE: HOUSTON

 BODY:
WHEN drilling rigs were plentiful across America's oil patch, state governments fought to keep revenues and regulatory control close to home, minimizing Washington's role. Even as domestic oil and gas production are at the lowest levels in decades, Congress will soon decide whether this fading industry should be compelled to pay more for environmental cleanup or continue its longstanding exemption from Federal environmental laws.
At issue is a delicate calculation applicable to many environmental dilemmas at a time of scarce government resources and a stalled national economy. If an industry is not pushed hard enough, environmental damage piles up, but if it is pushed too hard, businesses simply shut down, abandoning polluted sites. 
 Until now, state agencies, many of which were created to promote the oil industry, have tended to make this calculation for oil and gas fields, the largest generators of wastes still exempt from the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.
The principal complaint against the states is that even when their rules are adequate, enforcement is uneven. After oil-field waste polluted water-supply lakes, Oklahoma set up a prevention unit. Lowell Brown, its sole agent, said, "I have no directives and no work plans. I have been sitting here essentially doing nothing because I don't have any authority."
Under legislation proposed by Representative Dennis E. Eckart, Democrat of Ohio, the Federal Government would set minimum standards, stricter than many now imposed by any state. The states would retain considerable say over enforcement.
The proposals have met resistance. "To legislate such unnecessary changes at a time when we have the lowest rig count in history," said Denise A. Bode, president of the Independent Petroleum Association of America, "the lowest level of oil production in 30 years, the lowest natural gas prices at the wellhead in more than 15 years and when we have lost over 350,000 jobs in the production end of the business is irresponsible."
With Congress more likely to limit than expand the scope of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Mr. Eckart acknowledges the difficulty he is having in trying to push through his legislation. "When an industry has a blanket exemption and someone suggests the most modest regulation, they see it changing the universe in which they do business," he said.
Pumping oil, especially in America's substantially depleted fields, produces briny water, the most significant oil-field waste. It's as much as four times saltier than the oceans and contains a variety of heavy metals, organic toxins and low levels of radioactivity. Nearly 80 percent of the wells in Texas draw less than nine barrels of a oil a day and as much as 50 barrels of brine.
Often this brine is forcibly pumped back into the ground to maintain pressure in oil-bearing formations, a process subject to some Federal rules. A few states have tightened regulations on disposal methods like pouring it into open pits or dumping it in waterways. Nationwide, however, the laws are inconsistent.
"How do we make them realize that if these same substances were found anywhere else they would be regulated?" says Mr. Eckhart. "They feel they are entitled to this free ride, when in fact the days of entitlements for the oil industry are over."
The oil industry counters that it is already adequately regulated by the states and can't afford to do more.
Last year, the American Petroleum Institute calculated that under a hypothetical Federal regulatory program tougher than any proposed thus far, some 80 percent of all domestic oil and gas wells would be rendered unprofitable and would halt production, eliminating more than 40,000 industry jobs.
Melinda Taylor, an attorney for the National Audubon Society, which supports the Eckart bill, dismisses such numbers as the kind of lobbyists' doom-saying that confronts many new regulations. Insisting there's no intent to shut down marginal operators, Ms. Taylor complains, "They don't want to even talk about things like market incentives that have worked with other industries."
Governments of 29 oil-producing states have already closed ranks with the industry by stating their unanimous opposition to eliminating the oil field exemption.
Lena Guerrero, chairwoman of the Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates the oil industry, said, "I resent the idea that somebody in Washington will protect our environment better than we can. The geology, the industry and the environment is different in every state."
Proponents of the Eckart bill insist states would have the flexibility to deal with these differences, but also, as Ms. Taylor put it, "Federal standards give states backbone."
Texas adopted the most aggressive oil field cleanup program of any state, she noted, and yet could still take up to 50 years. Under the Eckhart bill, those same objectives would have to be met in just 10 years.
Martin V. Melosi, a history professor at the University of Houston, argues that state governments in the oil patch are now resisting Federal intrusion out of fear for their economic future. In 1981 Texas drew 28 percent of its state revenues from severance taxes on oil production; a decade later it was less than 9 percent. Every Texas budget now sparks dreaded talk of imposing income taxes for the first time.
"Texas has not readjusted its tax structure or altered its relationship with the oil industry ," said Professor Melosi. "Oil is still an important part of the fiscal mix, so it is easier to keep believing that prices will go up again someday, solving all the problems."
As Governor of Louisiana, Buddy Roemer imposed tough regulations on oil field wastes. Last year he was defeated for reelection, with much of the industry backing his successor, Gov. Edwin W. Edwards. Now there's a move to undo some of his efforts.
"Just turning an environmental problem over to the Feds won't solve it," Mr. Roemer said. "That's no substitute for an informed public looking after its own backyard. But the danger of leaving it to the states is that the track record is so uneven. Their history is often driven by personalities, not policies."

HEADLINE: IDEAS & TRENDS;
A Political Movement Blends Its Ideas From Left and Right

BYLINE: By PETER STEINFELS

 BODY:
HERE'S a barely noticed fact that could augur a serious change in the political landscape: not everyone who agrees with Dan Quayle about Murphy Brown is a conservative.
On the same day the Vice President complained in California that the popular television series was contributing to the woes of the poor by rendering single motherhood glamorous and derogating the importance of fathers, two speakers at a largely liberal gathering in New York City made exactly the same point. 
One was William A. Galston, a political philosopher at the University of Maryland, who occasionally advises Bill Clinton. The other, David Blankenhorn, heads the Institute for American Values, a Manhattan-based research center dealing with family issues. Both referred to a critique of Murphy Brown's motherhood by Barbara Dafoe Whitehead, a scholar who is a colleague of Mr. Blankenhorn's, that appeared in The Washington Post two weeks ago. The meeting was a "Communitarian Teach-In," and Mr. Galston, Mr. Blankenhorn and Ms. Whitehead all signed a "Communitarian Platform" that was issued last November.
Communitarianism is the new kid on the political block, staking out territory somewhere between the liberal advocates of the welfare state and civil liberties entrenched on one corner, and conservative devotees of laissez-faire and traditional values on the other. Communitarians generally line up with liberals as defenders of individual rights, equality and democratic change. But none of these things, they argue, can be preserved unless the nation's basic communities and institutions -- families, schools, neighborhoods, unions, local governments and religious and ethnic groups -- succeed in building character and instilling the virtues of citizenship.
"Strong rights presume strong responsibilities," said Amitai Etzioni, a George Washington University sociologist and one of the founding fathers of a movement he compares to the environmental movement.
Just as Americans could once take the quality of their air and water for granted, he explained, they could once concentrate on spelling out rights while assuming that citizens were endowed with a well-developed sense of obligation and responsibility. Where environmentalism focuses on the degradation of nature, communitarianism concentrates on the social environment.
Communitarians fault liberals for reflexively blaming economic and political forces for poverty, drug abuse, crime and urban and environmental blight while neglecting the importance of personal responsibility and the forces that have traditionally nurtured it. They also fault conservatives for exalting the free market and the pursuit of self-interest as remedies for social problems while ignoring the corrosive effect of economic pressure and a competitive ethos on family life and community spirit.
Communitarianism's leading concern is the family, "where each new generation acquires its moral anchoring," according to its platform. Most communitarians unabashedly endorse the two-parent family as the norm for society, although they acknowledge that some single parents succeed.
They also want to put the issue of widespread divorce back on the public policy agenda. Divorce laws, they argue, should be changed to ensure the economic support of children.
If that sounds conservative, communitarians sound liberal when proposing European-style child benefits, extended paid and unpaid parental leaves and flexible working hours.
From kindergarten to college, the communitarians argue, schools should make moral education and character formation leading priorities, rejecting the idea that Americans are so divided over basic values that moral education is impossible. Classroom instruction, they add, is less effective than the personal example set by educators and the atmosphere of the institutions.
An increased sense of public safety and order, stronger local government and renewed public spiritedness are other communitarian interests.
 
No 10-Point Program
 To achieve these ends, the group considers ideas from both liberal and conservative toolkits: informal social pressure on personal behavior, government funding of political campaigns and access to television, national service for young people and strict limits on gun ownership. But there is no 10-point program to which all communitarians agree. Some people view it more as a mood than a movement. "I see it simply as "a fresh way of talking and listening," said Mary Ann Glendon, a professor at the Harvard Law School, "an effort to break out of well-worn mental grooves and get a conversation going about things that aren't being addressed."
Professor Glendon helped formulate the group's platform, published in The Responsive Community, a quarterly journal founded -- "with some reluctance," Dr. Etzioni said -- to explore communitarian notions.
The signers of the platform include educators, feminists, former presidential advisers -- Republican and Democratic -- economists, theologians and a least one pollster. Democratic Senators Daniel P. Moynihan of New York and Al Gore of Tennessee and Republican Senator David Durenberger of Minnesota joined in a teach-in on Capitol Hill last year. Secretary of Housing Jack Kemp has also signaled his interest.
Like Ross Perot, the communitarian impulse appears to have surfaced out of a dissatisfaction with the alternatives. And like Mr. Perot, this neophyte movement has yet to define itself on many tough issues.
Its amorphousness has led critics on the right to dismiss communitarianism as merely warmed-over Great Society, while critics on the left fear it as the thin edge of the Moral Majority or a retreat to the 1950's.
"A lot of communitarian rhetoric appears to emphasize voluntary measures," said Nadine Strossen, president of the American Civil Liberties Union. "But that rhetoric is very slippery," she added, when it involves government in creating legal obstacles to divorce, indoctrinating through the public schools or giving police more leeway to search suspects.
Joan W. Konner, dean of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, puzzled over communitarianism at a dinner preceding last week's teach-in. It appeared to be one part church sermon, one part reassertion of old values, one part political campaign message and one part social movement, Dean Konner said.
The implicit criticism left Dr. Etzioni unfazed. "I couldn't have said it better myself," he replied.

HEADLINE: Conversations/Sergio Munoz;
An Invisible Presence Grows In the Barrios of Los Angeles

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
THE only decoration on the wall of Sergio Munoz's new office as executive news director of KMEX television is a color-coded map showing the density of the Hispanic population of Los Angeles by zip codes.
"This is the real story, as shown on this map," he said the other day, starting to speak before a visitor had time to take a seat. "You can see it very clearly. The growth of the Latino population is a fact of life. But if you look at the power structure, look at the social structure, look at the government, it's not there. From the outside, it's some sort of ghost, and it frightens people." 
Los Angeles has just passed through a social convulsion, a riot that shouted the message of economic inequalities in its inner city, but even now the huge Hispanic population remains something of a ghost as public attention is focused on the anger and the needs of the black community. Yet the focus of the recent rioting, Los Angeles's South Central section, is home to an almost even mix of black and Hispanic residents.
"Yes, the spark was black. It was the failure of the justice system to serve minorities, which is something Latinos can identify with," Mr. Munoz said, taking his seat at last. "The trigger was black. But the underlying reality was the interracial, inter-ethnic tensions of life in the inner city."
As an administrator and executive editor of La Opinion, the city's largest Spanish-language daily, for 12 years until last January, and as executive news director of its largest Spanish-language television station for the last four months, Mr. Munoz has observed the fast and silent expansion of the city's Hispanic population. Over the decade beginning in 1980, it swelled by 70 percent, from 816,000 to 1.4 million, and now comprises approximately 40 percent of the city's population of 3.7 million.
"There was a transformation we went through from an invisible community to a problem community, because we were either causing the problems or we were the victims of the problems, or both," Mr. Munoz said. "This fight for recognition has been very tough; very, very tough. Many people would say we haven't been as discriminated against as blacks, though if you go through the barrios you hear a lot of horror stories. The problem is how to gain access to institutions, how to become known as anything else but problem people."
 
Rapid Growth
 The first step is for the Hispanic community to know itself, but its rapid growth, intertwining a number of national histories, has outpaced the capacity of even its own leaders and public figures, like Mr. Munoz, to take its measure. In addition to the massive influx from neighboring Mexico, which has mushroomed in the last decade and a half, the growth since the 1970's has included a continuing wave of refugees from war and economic dislocation throughout Central America.
"I was once asked how it was to be the editor of a newspaper that is trying to cater to so many groups, to Nicaraguans, Salvadorans, Mexicans," Mr. Munoz said. "My answer was, that's not the worst part. The worst part is trying to please a community that is fragmented even within these groups. On the newspaper itself there were Sandinistas and Contras, and all the Argentinians that were for the Sandinistas and all the Chileans on the other side."
Drawn first to the traditional Mexican-American neighborhoods of East Los Angeles, the various national groups have radiated outward through the center of the city, their progress traced in the red, purple and green that show their density on Mr. Munoz's map. Many of them displaced and mingled with the black population of the South Central area.
When the rioting exploded, Mr. Munoz said, he was among the leading Hispanic figures who gathered to call for calm, only to discover that they did not know the names of any Hispanic community leaders in the South Central area. "What we learned was that there are all these people who are not represented anywhere," he said. "So now we are going to have to go down to the streets and talk to the people and see who they are, what they want, where they come from, who represents them and how they are planning to make their lives there."
A conversation in Mr. Munoz's small, spare office is interrupted constantly as he turns to speak on the telephone, gets up to make coffee or takes "just three minutes, please," to explain an assignment to one of his reporters. Born and raised in Mexico, educated in Mexico, Great Britain and the United States, Mr. Munoz, who is 50 years old, was a student of philosophy, then of film, then of literature before joining La Opinion as a journalist. At KMEX, he is the West Coast bureau chief of the nation's largest Spanish-language network, Univision, which is based in Miami. In the aftermath of the riot, he has been called upon to join the Ad Hoc Unity Coalition, political and community leaders gathered together to represent the needs of the Hispanic community in the city's economic recovery.
Today he took three minutes to discuss with a reporter a series of interviews with political candidates in which they would be asked, on behalf of the station's Hispanic audience, what difference the race for state Senate would make in their lives. For much of his audience, which can be as large as 300,000 viewers, political enfranchisement is a question that seems to lie well beyond their daily concerns. But in fact, Mr. Munoz said, it is at the heart of the pressures that exploded in the violence of the riots.
 
Explaining the Fires
 For the most part, the more established residents -- the homeowners, the extended families, the tight-knit neighborhoods -- of East Los Angeles stayed out of the rioting that swept through the South Central area.
"How do you explain the fires?" Mr. Munoz said, leafing through figures from the 1990 census. "Let's see how many of these people in South Central own their own homes: 62 percent of the houses in South Central are rented. Of this same population, 28.5 percent have less than a ninth grade education. You have 32 percent of the population under the poverty line, and what is really terrifying, 44 percent of the very poor people are children under the age of 18."
Many of these are the poor immigrants and their children who make up the bulk of the city's Hispanic population -- people Mr. Munoz described as sleeping in crowded rented garages, speaking little English and working for the mimumum wage or below.
People like this, he said, had little incentive to protect their communities from destruction and little to motivate them to preserve a social order in which they play little role. "You see all these people coming into stores and getting mattresses and getting Pampers. Are you going to hold onto your ethics and say, 'I'm not going to participate in this?' I really doubt it."
But as the red areas at the center of Mr. Munoz's map spread outward from East Los Angeles through the purple and into the green, and as the varied Hispanic communities put down roots and find their leaders, the little-noticed ghost will take more tangible form. "It seems that people on the East Coast, and many here in the West, still do not understand that things are no longer black and white here," Mr. Munoz said. "This is now a very complex interracial economic war."

HEADLINE: Teen-Age Murderers: Plentiful Guns, Easy Power

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER

 BODY:
Andre, who was 15 years old at the time, remembers the bang of the .32-caliber revolver and the little red spot that blossomed on the cheek of the boy he shot.
He remembers dodging traffic in Brooklyn to get away from the boy's friends and, finally, crouching on the floor of an abandoned apartment and listening to the scream of police sirens. 
 "I didn't intend to kill him," Andre said in a visiting room at the Harlem Valley Secure Center, a prison for teen-agers in the rolling hills north of New York City. "I just wanted to scare him. I didn't know it would go off so easily."
Tall and fleshy with a loping, insouciant walk, Andre is one of a growing number of American teen-agers who have murdered with guns.
A decade ago, when an exchange of punches was a probable outcome of two boys' facing each other down, 10 to 15 percent of the teen-agers who got into serious trouble in New York were carrying guns. Now, state officials estimate, it is 60 to 65 percent, and researchers at the Federal Centers for Disease Control say that shootings by teen-agers are contributing significantly to the nation's rising homicide rate.
With the calm detachment of spectators, Andre and two other young killers talked recently about their experiences with guns and crime, how they got the weapons, what led them to shoot and how they felt afterward.
Their stories yield a rare, intimate glimpse into a kind of thought and behavior that lie at the core of the violence eating away at the nation's cities.
The boys, who are serving life sentences with parole possible after as little as five years, their parents and the Division for Youth, which runs Harlem Valley and three other maximum-security prisons for teen-age boys, insisted that they not be fully identified.
For all three boys, who now live behind razor-wire-topped fences at the center in Wingdale, N.Y., a gun was easier to get in their rough New York neighborhoods than a new pair of sneakers. Yet they never bothered to learn much about guns or how to handle them. Psychologists say that just having a gun provides a sense of security and power and that many youths never visualize using it.
Neither Andre nor the other boys seemed to have thought about the consequences of pulling the trigger and they seemed surprised at the results. But they also did not seem to care much, one way or the other. Their initial reaction after the shootings was not sorrow or remorse, but survival: How do I get out of this?
 
'When They Feel Threatened'
 Liz Giordano, the director of Harlem Valley, sees a lot of boys like these. They are not good at sorting out life's everyday problems. "They are easily threatened," she said, "and when they feel threatened they pull the trigger."
That was precisely how it was for Andre. He fired, he said, when he thought he was going to be beaten up. One of the other boys, Jamel, felt humiliated by a 14-year-old girl. When he failed to impress her, he got flustered and shot her. The other boy, Dwayne, said he figured it was kill or be killed by rival drug dealers.
Guns are so plentiful in New York these days that teen-agers don't even have to buy them. Andre and Jamel didn't. Andre merely told a friend -- a crack dealer -- that he was being menaced by boys from another neighborhood, and the dealer handed him the .32-caliber revolver.
"The guy said: 'Take this for protection. If they don't have guns, scare them by shooting in the air. If they have guns, shoot back.' "
 
'15 Minutes to Get One'
 A crack dealer also gave Jamel the .25-caliber semiautomatic he used to kill the girl. But Dwayne paid $600 for his 9-millimeter semiautomatic.
His supplier, he said, was a neighborhood man of about 30 who had turned his basement into an armory, with shelves of guns and ammunition. The other boys said there always seemed to be someone around who knew where you could buy or borrow a gun. "It wouldn't take no more than 15 minutes to get one," Jamel said.
Andre and Dwayne grew up in homes in New York City in which marriages had failed. Jamel's father was disabled, his mother unemployed. There was never much money and the boys spent much time fending for themselves. Andre and Dwayne could get good grades in school when they tried. But none of the boys found their classes engaging.
Instead, they hung out, dreaming impossible dreams. Jamel saw himself as a wide receiver in the National Football League. Dwayne imagined he was a businessman or a professional basketball player. Either way, he had lots of money. None ever tried to get a legitimate job.
 
Andre
Avenging Beating With a Chrome .32
 Andre tried selling crack when he was 12, but he said it seemed "too dangerous." He was big for his age so he went into mugging.
"I would go up to somebody and tell them to give me their money," Andre said. "If they tried to hit me, my friends would jump in. We hardly ever used a weapon. Sometimes my friends had a razor."
He figures he had pulled off more than 120 muggings by the time he was 14. "It was fun," he said. "It's like getting away with something. It's like a high, excitement."
Did he understand it was wrong? "Not really," Andre said. "I didn't think much about it. It was like I was going through a stage."
Andre first held a gun when he was 13. He had cut class and ducked into a hallway in an apartment building with a classmate. "He had it in his waist," Andre said. "I examined it, took the clip out and put it in. When I was 14 I fired a .38 once in the air. It was somebody's birthday. There was a party in an apartment and we went up on the roof."
One afternoon, Andre was talking with two girls on a stoop when a dozen boys he had been feuding with rode up on bicycles. One swung a bat at him, he said, and another punched him in the face. The next morning he went to see his friend, a crack dealer, and got a chrome-plated Smith & Wesson .32.
 
Bumped Into Assailants
 After cowering on a roof most of the day, he decided, toward evening, to take a walk. Almost immediately he bumped into the boys from the previous day. One boy, 16, accused him of roughing up a cousin months earlier and started dancing like a prizefighter, jabbing a hand in his face, Andre said.
"I had the gun behind my back, but he could see it," Andre said. "I'm telling him to back away or else I'm going to have to shoot. I was petrified I was going to get jumped. The guy said, 'If you shoot me, you better kill me, because I'll get you.' "
Suddenly, as if unleashing a looping right hook, Andre swung the revolver up, tucked his face into a shoulder and squeezed the trigger. "When I looked up he was falling forward," Andre said, "and I started to run."
Andre insists he saw a knife partly concealed in the boy's hand. The police said no knife was found, but Andre says the victim's friends took the weapon and told the police he was empty-handed.
 
Jamel
Ignored by Girls, 'So I Got Mad'
 On a warm night in August, Jamel, who was then 13, and an 11-year-old friend were hanging out at the parking lot at their housing project. Jamel called out to two girls, but they ignored him. "So I got mad," he said.
He ran into a hallway where an older friend, a crack dealer, had been watching. "I was going to ask him for the gun," Jamel said, "but he just gave it to me. He said, 'Yo, go rob 'em.' "
Jamel said he and the younger boy chased the girls. With the chrome-plated pistol glinting in his hand, Jamel ordered the girls to turn over their earrings. One girl, the police said, replied mockingly: "They're fake, and that's a play gun."
That was it for Jamel. He fired a single shot and the girl collapsed with a chest wound. He didn't stick around.
Two days later a friend came up to him and said, "Yo, remember that girl you shot? She died."
Despite Jamel's youth, it was a minor miracle that he had not killed someone sooner. He'd been in several shootouts with other teen-agers, he said, and wielded guns in muggings.
 
'Put the Gun in His Mouth'
 Once, he said, as he and a friend walked away from a drug dealer, the friend said, "Yo, I don't like that guy."
Jamel had a .38 special bouncing lightly in the front pouch of his hooded sweatshirt. He suggested they rob the dealer. "I put the gun in his mouth," Jamel said, and the dealer handed over $600. As Jamel ran away, the dealer called out, "I'll kill you." The boy pivoted and emptied his gun, all six shots flying wild. "He threatened my life," Jamel explained. It was irrelevant, he said, that the dealer had been unarmed. Maybe next time he wouldn't be. Why take chances?
With his mugging profits, the 13-year-old bought 50 pairs of fancy sneakers, which he said he kept neatly stacked in boxes in his closet. His mother noticed the shoes, Jamel said, but accepted his story that they had been gifts from his big brother, an uncle or just friends.
 
Dwayne
Dealer Fears Little But Grandmother
 Dwayne is a small boy who, along with two friends, ran a prospering crack and heroin distribution business. The partners had lots of street salesmen working for them, and, Dwayne said, they built up an arsenal of two shotguns, three submachine-gun-style semiautomatic TEC-9's, a somewhat similar MAC-10, a Soviet-designed AK-47 assault rifle and an array of pistols.
"When you've got a gun," Dwayne said, "you just feel untouchable. You feel if you get into problems, you could always solve it with a gun."
Dwayne, who walked the streets like a prowling tiger, said he never took his guns home because his grandmother, with whom he lived, wouldn't allow it. He thought nothing of backing someone into a corner with a gun, but, like so many 15-year-olds, wouldn't confront the old woman.
Dwayne said he even obeyed her 11 P.M. curfew. But he said he made up stories when she asked him where he got the money to buy his bright red Jeep, the 10 gold caps he wore on his front teeth and the gold chains around his neck.
 
Just Like Dirty Harry's
 His first gun, he said, was a .357 Magnum known as a Desert Eagle, an enormous long-barreled pistol, only slightly smaller than the cannon in the hands of Clint Eastwood in the Dirty Harry movies. He never shot at anyone with the gun, he said; the mere sight of it was enough to clear a path.
One cold night in December, Dwayne said, three teen-age drug dealers with guns tried to rob him. But he made a commotion that attracted passers-by and got away.
The next day Dwayne and his partners spotted two of the boys. As Dwayne remembers it, he and his partners were ambushed and began shooting to save themselves. Bullets sliced the air, blowing out the windows of a white Jeep the other boys had dived behind and killing one of them, a 16-year-old.
In a different version, the police report says Dwayne and his partners saw two boys staring at them, took offense and, without any "apparent motive" started pumping lead. All three were charged with murder.
Dwayne vividly recalled the shootout, but he had to think a minute about how he felt on the street that night. "I didn't really feel nothing," he said finally. "I was very angry."

HEADLINE: Jury Deliberates in Racketeering Case Against Sect

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., May 23

 BODY:
From its start five months ago, the twin themes in the murder and racketeering trial of Yahweh ben Yahweh and 15 disciples have been race and religion.
That was especially apparent today as Judge Norman C. Roettger Jr. of Federal District Court gave the case to the jury today, with these instructions: 
 "Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this case involves, at least tangentially, or perhaps more stronger than that, very sensitive issues," Judge Roettger said.
Then, referring to racial composition of the jury -- nine of the jurors are white and three black -- he said: "The majority of the jury is not the same race as the defendant. Please, if you have any biases in that area, rise above them and deliberate in this case truly objectively. Put aside any biases you might have. It's critically important. Be impartial."
Yahweh ben Yahweh, who took the Hebrew name meaning "God, Son of God" when he founded the Nation of Yahweh in the early 1980's in Miami, preaches that blacks are the original Jews. He tells his followers that blacks should be aware of "white devils" seeking to enslave them economically, spiritually and socially and that blacks should be self-sufficient.
He and his disciples are accused in 14 murders and two attempted murders, and in the firebombing of a block of houses in Delray Beach, about 50 miles north of Miami.
Yahweh ben Yahweh and 10 followers face up to 40 years in prison if convicted of racketeering and conspiracy. Five others face only a conspiracy charge carrying a maximum 20-year term.
Prosecutors say eight of the 14 victims were chosen randomly as "white devils" and killed in retribution for wrongs committed by whites against blacks. Another victim, the Government says, was a black man who the sect considered a "blasphemer" because he had chased followers seeking donations away from his home. Prosecutors say Yahweh ben Yahweh also ordered the firebombing in 1986 in retaliation for an attack on disciples in the area.
Defense lawyers say some of the prosecution's witnesses, among them former followers of Yahweh ben Yahweh, are admitted liars and convicted murderers. Defense lawyers have criticized prosecutors as trying to inflame jurors by heightening issues about race and religion to gain convictions in the case.
"Prosecutors probably feared, 'Hey, we've got 15 black guys wearing white robes who believe a black man is God,' " one defense lawyer, Steven H. Kassner, said in his closing arguments. " 'We should be able to convict these guys just by reading the indictment.' "
Yahweh ben Yahweh's lawyer, Alcee L. Hastings, said that his client was guilty only of preaching self-sufficiency for blacks and that prosecution witnesses had something to gain by bringing down Yahweh ben Yahweh.
 
'Ain't Guilty of Racketeering'
 "He's guilty of preaching," Mr. Hastings said in his closing arguments. "He's guilty of teaching. He's guilty of saying he's the son of God, but he ain't guilty of racketeering."
Mr. Hastings himself has been the object of interest in the trial. A former Federal district judge, he was impeached by Congress in 1989 after questions were raised about his involvement in a bribery conspiracy. He has denied the charges and was acquitted in a criminal trial. He has also announced plans to run for Congress.
Earlier this week, a distraught juror in the case was replaced. The white female juror expressed fears for her safety and said a black male juror had made sexual advances. She also suggested that the Government had failed to prove its case against Yahweh ben Yahweh.
Judge Roettger replaced her with one of four alternate jurors after meeting with her.
The jurors had not been sequestered since the trial began in January. But today, after giving instructions to the jury, Judge Roettger ordered that they be sequestered until they delivered a verdict to insure that they did not read or see news accounts of the case.

HEADLINE: A Bank Shows It Can Profit And Follow a Social Agenda

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Nearly 20 years after the South Shore Bank in Chicago started an ambitious plan to revive an economically depressed black neighborhood, it has proved that a determined lender can reverse the process of urban decay and simultaneously make a profit.
The formula sounds simple: buy a local bank, create a for-profit real estate development company and a nonprofit community development company that works closely with the bank. The bank provides an opportunity for people to support the program's social goals without risk, by investing in federally insured deposits. The real estate company offers the possibility of profits, with some risks; the community development company seeks government and private grants. 
 With the South Shore neighborhood thriving to such a degree that other Chicago banks are competing to make loans there, South Shore Bank, which is owned by charitable groups, is pondering how its success can be exported. The founders are seeking money to expand in Chicago while helping similar projects in Arkansas, the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and Kansas City, Kan.
 
Limited Applications
 The need to provide economic opportunity in inner cities has been heightened by the riots in Los Angeles, and civic leaders are casting about for ideas that work. But South Shore's managers say their formula may not work everywhere.
"Our organization is applicable to lots of areas, but it is not a cure-all for the most depressed places in America," said Ronald Grzywinski, a founder of the bank and now chairman of its parent company, the Shorebank Corporation. "Our strategy relies on being able to cultivate a group of private individuals who are working in their own self-interest, which happens to be the best interest of the community. What we do would not work in the South Bronx, or other areas so distressed that the neighborhoods have gone to demolition."
The bank began in the South Shore area in Chicago, 250 square blocks and home to 78,000 people that is not far from Lake Michigan. By now it has provided financing for a third of the area's housing stock.
Once a well-to-do white residential area that became predominantly black in the 1960's and was decaying rapidly by the 1970's, South Shore is now a black middle-class neighborhood with a mixture of tidy single-family homes and small apartment buildings.
"One of the great strengths of Shorebank is that by affiliating a bank with a for-profit real estate developer and a nonprofit development company they can attract different kinds of support from organizations who have different appetites for risk," said Judith F. Samuelson, a director at the Ford Foundation, a big investor in Shorebank.
In southern Arkansas, Shorebank was asked by the Winthrop Rockefeller Foundation to organize a community-development banking company, and it created the Southern Development Bancorportion in its image. But rather than concentrate on real estate, which is the main business in the residential Chicago neighborhoods Shorebank serves, Southern Development concentrates on creating businesses and jobs to replace the factory jobs lost in the area around Arkadelphia and Pine Bluff in the 1980's.
 
Facing the Problem of Failing Business
 That strategy goes face to face with one of the hardest aspects of community development -- how to finance small businesses when most small businesses fail. It is a conundrum Shorebank faced early on.
"We would make a loan to help open a wonderful new shop, but next door and elsewhere on the block there was nothing going on, no synergy and nothing to create a shopping experience," said George P. Surgeon, a loan officer at South Shore in the 1970's and now president of the Elk Horn Bank and Trust Company in Arkadelphia, Ark. Elk Horn is the banking arm of Southern Development .
"Small-business lending is just plain tough, and it does not seem to matter in what neighborhood the business is located," said Mark A. Willis, president of the Chase Community Development Corporation, an affiliate of the Chase Manhattan Bank that lends in poor communities.
While Shorebank and its Arkansas sister grapple with the problems of small-business lending, Shorebank's past successes have caught the eye of social scientists and some politicians. David Osborne, author of "Laboratories of Democracy," a study of six state governments, has described Shorebank as "the perfect model for the 90's: inexpensive, market-oriented and entrepreneurial."
Shorebank is often mentioned by Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the front runner for the Democratic Presidential nomination, as a prototype for a network of community development banks he would encourage. Mr. Clinton, whose wife, Hillary, is on the board of Southern Development, directed state agencies to provide $300,000 of the $13 million of financing raised by the banking company.
Bruce Reed, a senior aide to Mr. Clinton, said the Governor's endorsement of community development banks was linked to a desire for tougher enforcement of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, which requires banks to invest in their community. Mr. Reed said Mr. Clinton would offer banks some kind of incentive to satisfy the act by channeling money to community development banks.
"Government needs to step in and spread the word that community development banks are a good idea, but most of the money can come at the local level from banks who ought to be investing locally anyway and from nonprofit organizations," Mr. Reed said.
 
Seeking Incentives To Foster Lending

Mr. Grzywinski, Shorebank's chairman, said he knew Mr. Clinton well but had not advised him on a national policy for community development banking. He has long advocated such policies.
"We should offer them new privileges like selling insurance or nationwide branching in exchange for a greater commitment to community development," he said. "Right now, in my judgment there is just not sufficient economic incentive for them to do it."
A proposal that would encourage more lending in low-income areas was part of the banking legislation passed last year but has not received the estimated $60 million a year it would cost. The rule, proposed by Representatives Thomas J. Ridge, Republican of Pennsylvania, and Floyd H. Flake, Democrat of Queens, offers a 5 percent cut in banks' payments for Federal deposit insurance if they increase lending in poor neighborhoods and a 50 percent cut in insurance payments on new deposits in low-fee checking accounts offered to the poor.
In Kansas City, Shorebank is spreading its ideas through the minority-owned Douglass State Bank. The bank was on the verge of failure last year but was saved with a $3 million grant from the Hall Family Foundation, which enlisted support from Shorebank to improve the bank's business practices and eventually make it a significant community development lender.
In the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, Shorebank has a plan for a business lending program. The project, which has the backing of the state and has raised more than $9.5 million of financing, is expected to start later this year.
 
Founders Wanted a Bank Revolution
 But the scarcity of Shorebank imitators is a disappointment to the bank's founders, three whites and one black, with ideals developed in the civil rights movement and community development efforts of the 1960's. They are wary of government programs that substitute regulations and bureaucracies for the discipline imposed by running a profitable bank, but bemoan the lack of effort by other banks in poor neighborhoods.
"When we were drinking beer 20 years ago and talking about our plans, we thought if we could be a success in the traditional business sense and impact the neighborhood, we would by now have started if not a large revolution, at least a small revolution, and banks like us would have grown up all over," said James Fletcher, a black who was a founder of South Shore Bank and is now its president.
Today, Mr. Fletcher is looking for more capital to allow Shorebank to grow, and says he would consider a public stock offering using a securities firm. But although Shorebank has been consistently profitable since 1975, its returns to its owners have been lower than average for banks its size, and a new share offering might not hold much appeal except for investors who share its social goals.
A key ingredient in Shorebank's success has been the ability to attract deposits from outside the bank's home market, reversing the normal pattern of banks collecting deposits in poor communities and making loans in other areas. The bank pays regular interest rates on the federally insured deposits, which totaled $104.2 million at the end of 1991, or more than 55 percent of all deposits.
The bank has used the deposits to rapidly increase its real estate lending, particularly in Austin, a more run-down neighborhood in western Chicago that the South Shore Bank entered six years ago. Its willingness to finance purchases and rehabilitation of small apartment buildings created dozens of entrepreneurs and a much improved stock of housing.
 
Poor Areas, Good Business
 Now, as other bankers are learning that real estate lending can be a good business even in poorer neighborhoods, Shorebank is taking another look at lending to small businesses.
Recent results have not been good and losses from business loans in Chicago increased sharply in the last two years.
Shorebank plans to cut back on business lending where it is vulnerable to loss and to compensate by sharply increasing loans that are guaranteed by the Small Business Administration. Last year it made $8 million of S.B.A. loans, the most of any bank in Chicago.
At Southern Development, the company is continuing with a business lending program that since mid-1988 has issued about $10.8 million of loans to borrowers who would not otherwise have received credit.
To handle loans too risky for a bank that accepts deposits, Southern Development uses a subsidiary called the Good Faith Fund. The fund, with 66 loans totaling $145,000, offers loans of $500 to a few thousand dollars to low-income people trying to start a business. Larger businesses are financed by the Elk Horn Bank or Southern Ventures, which makes long-term investments not allowed for banks.
James Bringley, senior vice president in charge of real estate lending, says the typical customer for the small-apartment-building loans that are the backbone of South Shore Bank is a handyman -- the bank lends to about 30 Croatian janitors -- or black couples in their 40's with some savings and ambition.
"These are not sophisticated real estate investors, but they know how to get rid of a bad tenant; they are handy at repairs, and they know how to get good value for their dollar," Mr. Bringley said. He noted that the bank now has about three dozen customers for whom managing apartments and rehabilitating buildings has become a full-time business.
David Dorsey and his wife, Ann, for example, started borrowing from Shorebank in 1973, when they fixed up a four-family house. Since then, Mr. Dorsey, a former electrician, has tackled bigger jobs and recently renovated a 16-unit apartment building.

HEADLINE: John Gates, 78, Former Editor of The Daily Worker, Is Dead

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
John Gates, who quit as a top American Communist official and chief editor of The Daily Worker after losing a campaign to democratize the party and free it from Moscow's control, died yesterday at the Miami Heart Institute in Miami Beach. He was 78 years old and lived in North Miami Beach.
He died of heart disease and a stroke, his family said. 
 Mr. Gates broke from the party in 1958 after much soul-searching, which began while he served a five-year prison sentence. He and other party leaders were convicted of advocating the overthrow of the Government, which they denied.
 
A Turning Point
 After his release in 1955, new revelations came of the abuses of Stalinism. In 1956, Nikita Khrushchev denounced Stalin and the Soviets crushed the rebellion in Hungary.
"For the first time, I feel ashamed of the name Communist," Mr. Gates said. He led a faction in intense infighting to change the party, but lost.
He quit with a rebuke. "The ideals that attracted me to socialism still motivate me," his resignation said, but "the Communist Party has ceased to be an effective force for democracy, peace and socialism."
 
Helped Workers With Claims
 After writing a book on his experience, he became a senior research assistant at the International Ladies Garment Workers Union.
At the union, He helped members with workers' compensation, unemployment and Social Security claims. He retired in 1987.
He felt vindicated by the recent collapse of Communism and the Soviet Union, "but it was an unhappy vindication, because it took so long and so many people suffered," his wife, Lillian, said.
Mr. Gates remained concerned about the issues that led him to Communism: poverty, discrimination, homelessness, hunger and inadequate schools and health care.
He criticized capitalism for placing profit above the public welfare and keeping power in the hands of a few, but he grew wary of ideological prescriptions.
"After being so certain and dogmatic," he wrote after quitting the party, "I do not profess to have all the answers."
 
Moved to Ohio
 Mr. Gates was born in Manhattan and reared there and in the Bronx. He joined the Communists at the age of 17 as an outgrowth of a protest at City College.
In the early 1930's, during the Depression, he left his college studies to mobilize jobless youths in Ohio. He ran for the Youngstown City Council and was jailed on a charge of making a loud noise without a permit.
He fought in the Spanish Civil War, becoming the commissar of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade at the age of 24, the highest-ranking American in the war.
During World War II, he enlisted in the United States Army and volunteered as a paratrooper in Europe.
Resuming his Communist work after the war, he became one of seven national secretaries and the editor of the Worker. Despite his conviction in the nation's first Communist trials, he always maintained his loyalty to America.
Mr. Gates said he favored peaceful, democratic change to socialism, and opposed force, violence and espionage.
 
A Final Judgment
 In prison, he later wrote, "We talked endlessly, of what we might have done better in the past, what we could do in the future." His discussions and introspection eventually led him to say: "Today, the Communist Party has become irrelevant."
Surviving are his wife of 47 years, the former Lillian Schwartz; a brother, Nat Regenstreif, of Hollywood, Fla., and three sisters, Blanche Smiles of the Bronx, Irene Travis of Charlotte, N.C., and Marlene Seml of Boca Raton, Fla.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Personal Finances;
Perot Reneged on Pledge to Reagan

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KELLY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 23

 BODY:
A little more than a year after pledging $2.5 million to support President Ronald Reagan's official library, in thanks for the President's "years of outstanding leadership and service," Ross Perot reneged on most of the pledge in 1987 because he apparently was angry over what he saw as a lack of interest in American servicemen missing in Southeast Asia.
The episode suggests the importance of Mr. Perot's experiences with the prisoner-of-war and missing-in-action issue in changing his feelings toward the Reagan Administration and then Vice President George Bush, whom Mr. Perot now seeks to replace in the White House. 
 Mr. Perot's financial involvement with the $60 million Ronald Reagan Presidential Library began March 6, 1986, when he wrote a letter to President and Mrs. Reagan at the White House, saying that his family had decided to support the privately financed library because Mr. Reagan had been "such a great President."
 
A Letter of Superlatives
 His family, Mr. Perot wrote to Mr. Reagan, had asked him to:
"Thank you for making us proud to be Americans again.
"Thank you for your leadership in lifting our nation's sense of destiny above the day-to-day problems that surround us.
"Thank you for reminding us that we are our brothers' keeper, and that we must help one another.
"As the leader of the free world, thank you for keeping us at peace.
"Thank you for stabilizing the economy, dramatically reducing inflation, and interest rates and creating an environment where most Americans have secure, stable jobs."
Mr. Perot went on to thank Nancy Reagan for her "great work in caring for the families of the men who were prisoners of war in Vietnam and for mobilizing the nation to protect children from drugs."
He then wrote that "the Perot family pledges $2.5 million to the Reagan Library to thank and honor both of you for your years of outstanding leadership and service to our nation and the world,"
 
Pressing Interest in P.O.W.'s
 Mr. Perot donated $500,000 as an initial payment toward his pledge, James Squires, the spokesman for Mr. Perot Presidential drive, said today and left $2 million outstanding.
At the time, Mr. Perot was passionately concerned with the P.O.W.-M.I.A. issue. For years he had held a strong view that American servicemen, perhaps hundreds of them, were secretly held prisoner in Southeast Asia and that American officials knew this but were unwilling, for various reasons, to act on it.
Mr. Perot discussed the matter with Vice President Bush, and he has said, in interviews, that Mr. Bush asked him to conduct a study of Government P.O.W.-M.I.A files, to determine if American officials were doing a good job. His search led him into confrontations with Federal officials over the best strategy for negotiating with Vietnam to win the release of any Americans still held captive and the remains of those American prisoners who had died in North and South Vietnam.
 
Crucial Visit to Hanoi
 In March 1987, Mr. Perot went to Hanoi, Vietnam, to continue his work on the issue, a trip he has said in previous interviews that he undertook with the blessing of the White House.
That trip, and his disappointment in the Government's reaction to it, was the turning point in Mr. Perot's relationship with the Reagan Administration and led directly to the cancellation of his pledge to the Reagan library.
"Perot came back convinced that we could deal effectively with the Vietnamese," Mr. Squires said, "but he found when he returned that the Reagan Administration would not take the trip seriously. He gave a report to the Reagan Administration criticizing its policies and soon after that he canceled his pledges."
Mr. Perot could not be reached today to discuss the issue. According to an account in The Washington Post last month, he has said he reneged on the pledge because of his disgust over the Iran-contra affair, which began to come to light in November 1986, and not because of the P.O.W-M.I.A. issue
Mr. Squires said Mr. Perot "became unhappy with Reagan and Bush" for several reasons, including the matter of arms sales to Iran and undercover aid to the Nicaraguan rebels. But he added that Mr. Perot's anger over the Administration's handling of the P.O.W.-M.I.A. issue and its response to his trip to Hanoi were central to his turning against the President he had so highly praised the year before.

HEADLINE: Dealer Sues U.S. Over Seized Tyrannosaur Bones

BYLINE: By MALCOLM W. BROWNE

 BODY:
In the latest twist in a tortuous legal battle for custody of a 65-million-year-old dinosaur skeleton, a South Dakota fossil dealer has filed a lawsuit against the Federal Government that lawyers believe might eventually reach the Supreme Court.
The suit was filed in a United States District Court on Friday by the Black Hills Institute of Geological Research to recover a priceless Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton that was seized from the company on May 14 by about 50 National Guardsmen and agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
 The issues involve not only the largest and most complete tyrannosaur skeleton ever found, but an ill-defined and contentious body of laws applying to American Indian lands.
The tips of bones belonging to the dinosaur, named "Sue" for its discoverer, Susan Hendrickson, were spotted protruding from a cliff face near Faith, S.D., in 1990. The Black Hills Institute, a highly regarded commercial fossil dealer in Hill City, S.D., bought the right to excavate the skeleton for $5,000 from the land owner, Maurice Williams, a member of the Cheyenne River Sioux tribe.
The huge fossil was eventually unearthed, cleaned and moved about 140 miles to Hill City, where Peter Larson, president of the company, announced that he would build a non-profit museum to display Sue and other fossils of the Cretaceous period.
 
10 Tons of Sue
 Then came the May 14 raid in which Justice Department employees, under orders from United States Attorney Kevin Schieffer, loaded 10 tons of Sue, plus other fossils, documents, photographs, scientific records and other "criminal evidence," aboard tractor-trailer trucks and shipped them about 25 miles to Rapid City for storage.
Mr. Schieffer announced that he had seized the fossils on behalf of the United States because they had been illegally excavated, perhaps even stolen, from what he said was Federal land. In an interview, Mr. Schieffer said he had ordered the raid after tribal lawyers requested a Federal investigation.
And that, as one lawyer put it, "reopened the old can of worms." The laws applying to Indian reservation lands are so tangled, contradictory and charged with social, economic, political and emotional issues that they have never been definitely sorted out.
 
A Scattershot Lawsuit
 In an effort to come to grips with the confusion, Patrick L. Duffy, a lawyer for the Black Hills Institute, filed a scattershot suit on Friday, in which he named as defendants the United States, the Department of Justice, the Secretary of the Interior, the Cheyenne River Sioux tribe and the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, in whose vaults the F.B.I. has stored Sue.
Ambiguities arise from the fact that Mr. Williams, the owner of the land where Sue was found, is a registered member of the tribe and lives on land within the reservation. Although Mr. Williams is the land owner, since 1969 the title to his property has been temporarily held in trust by the Department of the Interior.
Mr. Schieffer, the United States attorney, says this means that the land is federal property, that Sue is therefore Government property, and that crimes have been committed by "stealing" an antiquity from Federal land.
Mark Van Norman and other lawyers for the Indian tribe regard the fossil as Indian property and "part of our cultural heritage." They said they feared it might be sold, and the tribe might be deprived of any benefits.
The Black Hills Institute claims that the excavation site is not tribal land but is owned by Mr. Williams, and that his contract with the institute was legal.
 
Seizure Called 'Absurd'
 Scientists, meanwhile, hope Sue's remains are not damaged in the uproar. Dr. Robert Bakker, a prominent paleontologist at the University of Colorado, praised Mr. Larson's close cooperation with scientific institutions, and described the Government's seizure as "absurd."
"It's the action of Federal grandstanders who have neither understanding of nor sympathy for the objectives of science," he said.

HEADLINE: European Nations Preparing for Penalties Against Serbia

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LISBON, May 23

 BODY:
European nations prepared today for a crucial meeting this week on the crisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with Germany's new Foreign Minister saying he favored the toughest possible economic sanctions.
The German, Klaus Kinkel, told reporters after a meeting with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d that he would back trade and oil embargoes against the new, smaller Yugoslavia as well as a ban on air traffic to and from Belgrade, the capital. He said Europeans should "shut down" Yugoslavia economically. 
 From the beginning of old Yugoslavia's dissolution a year ago, the Germans have actively supported the breakaway republics and critical of the Serbs. Germany first pressed for recognition of Slovenia and Croatia when the United States argued for restraint.
Now the Germans and the Bush Administration find themselves on the same side of the debate over sanctions against Yugoslavia, under President Slobodan Milosevic, a Serbian nationalist as well as an old-line Communist.
 
Now a Matter of the Details
 As the European Community searches for a common approach on a response to Serbian attacks in Bosnia and Herzegovina, a Portuguese spokesman for the community's rotating presidency declared here today that new sanctions were coming. "But we must now choose which ones," he said.
France and Greece have been reported reluctant to treat the truncated Yugoslavia -- the former republics of Serbia and Montenegro -- too harshly.
Mr. Baker returned to the Bosnian matter in a speech he delivered here today at the opening session of a 62-nation meeting on aid to the former Soviet republics. "I call upon every state and organization at this conference," he said, "to use whatever influence you have to make known that there is a cost for aggression and that the world demands safe passage for humanitarian convoys and the opening of Sarajevo airport immediately."
He asked those present to "join in a collective effort to mobilize our political, diplomatic, economic influence to make it plain there's a price to be paid for blocking peace and terrorizing innocent peoples."
On Friday, the United States announced that it was expelling a number of Yugoslav diplomats and closing two of three Yugoslav consulates. Mr. Baker also said that he had decided not to send back the American Ambassador, Warren Zimmermann, who is in Washington for consultations. Links with the Yugoslav military will be broken, too, Mr. Baker said.
The European foreign ministers met over lunch today to discuss the Bosnian crisis, but deferred decisions on their response until the meeting Tuesday.
The leader of ethnic Serbs in Bosnia who have joined the Yugoslav military in opposing the independence of the republic is also in Lisbon, urging Europeans to think twice about sanctions.
The official, Radovan Karadzic, has been taking part in the community's discussions with all the Bosnian ethnic groups. He told reporters today that the Americans and Europeans were risking "a total Balkan war" if they instituted more crippling economic measures against Belgrade.

HEADLINE: Data Shows Fall in Giving by Rich, Even as Ranks of Millionaires Grow

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 23

 BODY:
While the incomes of the rich rose in the 1980's at a pace unmatched since the 1920's, on the average they gave a far smaller share of their income to charity, new studies show.
In 1979, people making more than $1 million (as measured in constant 1991 dollars) gave more than 7 percent of their after-tax income to charity; by 1991 the figure had declined to less than 4 percent. 
 Although the millionaires gave less on average, their numbers increased so greatly over the decade that the overall total of actual charitable giving reached record levels.
The latest figures, in a draft study presented by three Treasury Department economists at a symposium of the National Tax Association here this week, tracked charitable giving over the decade.
For all wage groups who itemized deductions on their tax returns, the average charitable contributions increased by 9.2 percent over the decade; for those with pretax incomes above $1 million, measured in 1991 dollars, such deductions decreased by 38.6 percent, according to the draft study by Gerald E. Auten and two colleagues in the Treasury Department.
 
'Very Disheartening Facts'
 "My personal view is that these are very disheartening facts," said Larry Katz, a professor of economics at Harvard University. Cautioning that he must reserve judgment until he had seen the statistics on charitable giving, he put them in the context of the increase in income disparity in the United States in the past decade. "Not only did the top end get more, the need at the bottom increased," he said.
The decline in individual donations by the rich seems at odds with data showing that the very wealthy provided an increasing share of the nation's charity, which rose to $122.5 billion in 1990.
But Virginia Hodgkinson, research director for Independent Sector, a Washington-based association of not-for-profit groups, said that while the millionaires' share of total charitable giving more than doubled from 1980 to 1990 the increase in the number of millionaires in that time outstripped the increase in giving by at least 4 to 1.
The data on charitable giving by the rich are still somewhat undigested and are subject to different interpretations. Lawrence A. Kudlow, the chief economist at Bear Stearns, rejected the notion that the newly rich were less altruistic than their predecessors.
 
'Decade of Greed Is Unproven'
 "There was significant giving in the 1980's," Mr. Kudlow said. "This notion it was a decade of greed is unproven by the data. Individual giving rose 3.1 percent annually between 1955 and 1980; it rose 5.1 percent annually between 1980 and 1990."
Contributions from living people made up half the $10 billion total contributions of the wealthy in 1989. The remainder came from bequests from estates. But the total share of such estates given to charity was stagnant for most of the decade, economists say.
Two studies by the Internal Revenue Service, in 1976 and 1986, showed that 4 out of 5 Americans who left estates of at least half a million dollars gave nothing to charity, said Barry Johnson, an I.R.S. economist. Charitable bequests represented 10 percent of all such estates in 1976; 10 years later the amount had dropped to 6.3 percent.
As for donations by other income groups, the data showed that those earning $25,000 to $30,000 gave a larger percentage of their income to charity in 1989 than did those earning $50,000 to $75,000.
The figures leave important questions unresolved, including the extent to which changes in tax law in 1981 and 1986 discouraged philanthropy. Although cuts in marginal income tax rates to 28 percent from 70 percent left the wealthy with more of their earnings, the changes simultaneously reduced tax breaks for charitable giving.
The decreasing tax benefit for lifetime giving may have led the wealthy to forms of giving that were less visible on tax returns, the basis of the studies.
 
Short-Term Millionaires
 In addition, the Treasury economists' work fails to distinguish the long-term rich from the temporary millionaires, who vaulted into the million-dollar income group on a one-time basis through hefty stock or real-estate profits. Because of such limitations, economists say, the figures do not provide conclusive evidence that the country's top money-makers grew less altruistic as they grew richer.
Nonetheless, some experts find the trend disturbing. "You have a lot of new wealthy," Mrs. Hodgkinson said. "I'm not sure they're stingier. They may not have the habit of how to use their wealth. The primary motivation among the wealthy, especially the new wealthy, is accumulation. That's a powerful motivator.
"Among those who do give, there are some who are truly generous. These are people who have a commitment to causes and or institutions. The money isn't as important to them as their commitment."
Mrs. Hodgkinson cautioned that the dip in per-capita giving among the millionaires might reflect a temporary lag. But Internal Revenue Service data analyzed by one economist, Gabriel Rudney, a member of the board of the American Association of Fund Raising Counsels Trust for Philanthropy, raises doubts about the willingness of the average millionaire to make large charitable bequests.
"Large gifts reported in the news support the stereotype that 'as a rule' wealthy individuals give a substantial part of their income and wealth to charity," Mr. Rudney and his wife, Shirley, wrote in an article in upcoming issue of "Giving USA," the association's newsletter. "But such reports mask the actual lack of generosity among such persons."
 
Split Personality in Giving
 Mr. Rudney said the rich have what he called a "split personality" in their giving habits. Some give remarkable amounts, he said, and others give nothing, a pattern he saw reflected both in giving by the living and in charitable bequests in the wills of the wealthy.
The 1980's did see the birth of more foundations than any earlier decade. In 1988, David Packard, co-founder of Hewlett-Packard, announced he would give $2 billion to the David and Lucile Packard Foundation. The Philadelphia publishing magnate, Walter H. Annenberg, gave $252 million to the United Negro College fund in 1990. Henry A. Kravis, a man who came to symbolize the vast wealth made in leveraged buyouts, donated $10 million for a wing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
Mr. Auten, the Treasury Department economist, declined to comment on the draft paper. But a summary of his discussion at the symposium was published this week by the Bureau of National Affairs, a daily compendium of government-related events in Washington. It noted Mr. Auten's assessment that the decline in the average donations of the wealthy was less than some had feared it would be as a result of the tax modifications.
But what about the increased money available to the wealthy as a result of these tax changes? Charles Clotfelter, a Duke University professor of economics and public policy, said, "If nothing else had happened, you could explain these developments in these terms: a rich person saying, 'Yes, my income went up and that stimulated me to give more, but the price of giving went up so high that on balance my giving went down.' "

HEADLINE: Striving for Balance

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS

 BODY:
Weak and wobbly though it may be in some ways, the treaty on preserving the world's biological species adopted on Friday in Nairobi, Kenya, is being characterized by some conservationists as a bona fide breakthrough in dealing with the central problem to be addressed at next week's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro: how to accommodate economic development without damaging the planet's life support system.
As the global economy expands and the population of developing countries soars, humans are destroying natural ecosystems and habitats at a rate that some biologists fear will result in the extinction of perhaps a quarter of the world's plant, animal and microbial species in the next 50 years. The organisms are part of the interdependent web of life vital to all species, including Homo sapiens. 
 Now, for the first time, 98 nations have taken formal steps to deal with the situation. The United States, Japan and perhaps other countries object to some aspects of the agreement and may not sign it, but if 30 or more countries ratify the treaty it will take effect and be binding on them.
 
'Breaks New Ground'
 The treaty aims to reconcile the twin imperatives of economic development and the protection of species and ecosystems. It "is the first attempt to marry the two concepts in practice," said Richard Mott, the treaties officer of the World Wildlife Fund, who attended the Nairobi talks. "It is a treaty that truly breaks new ground. It will not put an end to the extinction of plant and animal species overnight, but it is the first attempt by governments to tackle the problem at its root causes in a systematic manner."
The treaty, he said, also institutionalizes a new concept that many conservationists are beginning to embrace: conservation will fail unless it is integrated with human activity.
The agreement was reached after two weeks of talks that turned chaotic near the end because of pressure to have the treaty ready for heads of state to sign in Rio. The biodiversity treaty is one of two pillars of the summit; the other, a treaty committing its ratifiers to stablize emissions of gases believed to cause global warming, was negotiated earlier this month.
Critics say both cases represent a lowest-common-demoninator approach to the problem and therefore fall far short of the ideal. But many experts, including some critics, also say that each nevertheless establishes a framework that could provide the basis for dealing with the two global problems over the long term.
 
Commits Nations to Act
 The biodiversity treaty commits nations that ratify it to take actions aimed at preserving species and ecosystems while pursuing economic development and attacking poverty.
The nations would develop national strategies to integrate conservation into their planning in the hope that species and ecosystem protection would become an everyday component of economic and social policy. They would also set up protected areas, promote the protection of whole ecosystems as well as individual species, manage biological resources with the aim of protecting them both inside and outside formal preserves and restore degraded ecosystems.
The treaty requires countries to inventory and monitor their biological assets and calls for signers to meet periodically to assess progress. They could take further action if necessary.
While most of the concern about species protection has been voiced by the rich industrialized nations, most of the species themselves are found in the developing countries of the tropics, where economic survival is by far the top preoccupation. So the specific conservation actions required are hedged about with qualifiers like "as far as possible" and "as appropriate."
 
Helping Poor Countries
 The treaty says conservation should take fully into account that economic and social development and the eradication of poverty are the first priority of the developing countries. It says that any conservation efforts they undertake will depend on the flow of money from rich nations. And it calls for the poorer, species-rich countries to reap a fair share of the profits when enterprises in rich countries exploit their biological resources.
"There will be those who will say the convention is too weak, barely addressing the magnitude of the threat to the global web of life," said Dr. Mostafa K. Tolba, executive director of the United Nations Environment Program, under whose auspices the treaty was negotiated. But, he said, "the process of international environmental law requires us, for better or for worse, to walk before we can run and to crawl before we walk."
As precedent, he cited the 1985 Vienna treaty -- "not strong in itself" -- that established a process and framework for dealing with depletion of the earth's protective ozone layer. That treaty later led to a series of later measures that have culminated in the banning the production of ozone-destroying chemicals.
The United States, which had pressed for strong conservation measures in the talks, would have preferred stronger measures than those that emerged, said E. U. Curtis Bohlen the Assistant Secretary of State for the Environment. But it is on other grounds that the United States is expressing serious doubts about whether it will sign the treaty.
 
Worries on U.S. Patents
 For instance, he said, it fails to give adequate patent protection to American companies that transfer biotechnology to developing countries, it leaves unclear the long-term mechanism for transferring money to the poor nations and it tries to regulate genetically engineered materials, a competitive area in which the United States leads.
Historically, conservationists have set aside nature preserves and let nature take its course. Despite this, species loss and ecosystem damage have continued apace. The new treaty, Mr. Mott of the World Wildlife Fund said, makes it incumbent on the signers to develop and promote conservation projects that combine both conservation and development goals. Such measures might include, for instance, the environmentally friendly and potentially lucrative exploitation of forests for medicine, food and tourism.
Dr. Tolba of the United Nations said described the treaty as a "two-way street." If either the rich countries or the poor countries renege on their part of the bargain, he said, it will fail.
How well it is carried out, Mr. Mott said, "is part of a great experiment in finding ways to bring human activity into balance with nature."

HEADLINE: Airport's Ill Winds

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON

 BODY:
In the wreckage of an ambitious but ill-fated plan to rebuild Kennedy International Airport lies at least $100 million in waste, a handful of half-finished and now mostly useless construction projects and plenty of attempts to lay blame at someone else's door.
In a report to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo last week, Stanley Brezenoff, the executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs the airport, places responsibility for the plan on his predecessors, who began the program and eventually killed it. 
 The Governor has also blamed the Port Authority, expressing alarm when the first reports of the waste appeared in Newsday, and calling on the authority to come up with a plan to avoid such waste in the future.
But Stephen Berger, who was in charge of the authority at the time the plan was adopted and instituted, has pointed a finger back at the Governor, saying he had veto power over the plan and had been kept abreast of its progress. Mr. Berger has defended the rebuilding program and says that it eventually will be proven valid.
The footwork in this dance of mutual recrimination is as much about politics as it is about policy or planning. And it is complicated by the framework of the 1980's, when the airport plan was put together and when planners' forecasts were skewed by economic optimism.
"Who is to blame? That's a tough question," said Richard C. Leone, chairman of the authority's commissioners. "I am a strong believer in accountability and I think people at the Port now feel that pressure.
"But I think you can only judge people on what they knew at the time. I don't fault the original optimism even though I didn't share it. We cut our losses much earlier than some others did in those days."
Mr. Leone, then a member but not chairman of the board, was an early skeptic of the $3.2 billion airport plan called J. F. K. 2000, which was adopted in 1987. He was responsible for limiting the project's spending to $150 million until the airlines agreed to pay their share. The airlines' growing resistance to the cost eventually led to the plan's being scrapped.
 
'Responsibility,' Not 'Blame'
 Mr. Brezenoff's report to the Governor does not specifically name Mr. Berger, only Port Authority "planners" and "staff." Asked whether he believed Mr. Berger was to blame, Mr. Brezenoff said: "Blame is a word I tend to shy away from. I think responsibility is a better word."
But he added, "All of us who run public agencies are ultimately responsible for those particular judgements and decisions that were made in a particular context, and need to be understood in that context."
The context of the mid-80's led to optimistic forecasts showing passenger loads growing by half again as large as the 25 to 30 million travelers Kennedy was handling annually. But instead of growing, the number of passengers has fallen, from slightly more than 31 million in 1988 to 26.3 million last year.
Mr. Berger maintains that the forecasts will be proven sound in the long run, and that a rebuilt airport will eventually be needed if the city's flagship airport is to maintain its position as the country's premiere international gateway.
 
How Much Cuomo Knew
 At the same time, Mr. Berger has insisted that the Governor's staff was briefed in detail about all Port Authority projects, particularly because Mr. Cuomo frequently criticized the agency as being aloof and having an extravagant management style. Others then inside the agency have supported Mr. Berger's position.
The Governor's senior advisers have responded that he knew of the broad policy on the rebuilding plan, but that its execution was the responsibility of the Port Authority.
Last Sunday, Mr. Cuomo asked the authority to detail by June 15 how it would "avoid waste and ill-conceived capital investments in the future" and how it would use airport projects already finished.
But Mr. Berger said Mr. Cuomo's staff had been doing that all along.
"We paid $200,000 a year for his staff to watch what we were doing," Mr. Berger said in an interview. "We had lots of his staff who were fully informed of what was going on at the authority, I spoke to his senior staff on a regular basis about J. F. K. 2000 and on the entire capital program."
Until now, Mr. Berger said, the Governor has shown scant personal interest in the agency's plans.
"He never met with the board," Mr. Berger, who is now an investment banker, said. "I was at the Port four and a half years, and I think I spoke to Cuomo on policy issues twice. All of the communicating was done by intermediaries, who, depending on their feeling about his mood, would or would not take difficult issues to him."
 
'Gives Me a Curious Feeling'
 Peter C. Goldmark Jr., the president of the Rockefeller Foundation and Mr. Berger's predecessor as executive director of the Port Authority, also defended the agency's role.
"In the second half of the 1980's the Governor's office was involved intensely and in detail with very capital decision the Port Authority made," Mr. Goldmark said. "The Governor's office said, 'Hey, the Governor has to approve the minutes of every meeting and we want to be a full partner in all decisions.' So as someone who knows this, it gives me a curious feeling to see a statement saying, 'Well, we ought to review how these decisions were made.' "
Mary Ann Crotty, the Governor's director of policy management, said that while the Governor could veto the authority's actions, neither he nor his staff could be expected to second-guess its execution.
"We get involved in broad policy questions with the Port Authority," she said. "We might say we don't want to put money into an airport, we want to put it into bridges, or ask, 'Is it really worth spending this money?' But when it comes to actually implementing a decision and making sure all of the agreements are in place, it is reasonable to expect the agency to be responsible for that."

HEADLINE: PENTAGON DROPS GOAL OF BLOCKING NEW SUPERPOWERS

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 23

 BODY:
The Pentagon has revised a draft of its post-cold-war strategy, dropping language from an earlier document advocating the perpetuation of a one-superpower world in which the United States would work to prevent the rise of any "competitors" to its primacy in Western Europe and East Asia.
The new document, approved by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney on Friday, sharpens the American commitment to collective military action as a "key feature" of United States strategy and looks forward to the decline of military investment as the principal means of balancing power among nations. 
 With far more diplomatic language than in an earlier draft, the new document forsakes any goal of preventing the emergence of "any potential future global competitor" and stresses the importance of strengthening international organizations like the United Nations for resolving disputes.
 
Input From Cheney
 The elimination of what was a dominant theme in the earlier draft reflects high-level input from both Mr. Cheney and Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, senior Pentagon officials said. The new language represents a significant retrenchment and appears to have discredited the idea, expressed in internal Administration foreign policy discussions, that the United States should focus its energies on containing German and Japanese aspirations for regional leadership.
The nearly final draft has been circulating in the Pentagon since April 16. A copy was provided to The New York Times by an Administration official who believes the debate on post-cold-war strategy should be conducted in public.
 
Earlier Draft Criticized
 The earlier draft, dated Feb. 18, was roundly criticized in the White House and in foreign capitals after its contents were disclosed in The New York Times in March. Prepared under the supervision of the Pentagon's Under Secretary for policy, Paul Wolfowitz, the earlier draft implied that a competing power or alliance of nations, bolstered by surging economic strength in Germany or Japan, could arise from these nations and eventually express their rivalry with America through military competition.
To keep this from happening, the earlier draft proposed that the United States build a new order based on "convincing potential competitors that they need not aspire to a greater role or pursue a more aggressive posture to protect their legitimate interests."
The new draft reflects an American foreign policy establishment far less threatened by ascending roles for important allies, even leadership by those allies when their interests are more directly affected. Yet a goal of the new draft is to seek to preserve a leading American role in strategic deterrence and regional alliances that will, by their demonstration of military cooperation, deter hostile and non-democratic powers from seeking to dominate important regions.
On Friday, Germany and France announced the formation of an all-European military corps and invited other nations to join. The new security alliance would work with NATO in crises where NATO'S 16 member nations declared an interest, but would also respond independently in crises where NATO interests were not involved.
The later Pentagon draft substantially softens the earlier document's expressed opposition to emerging security alliances in Europe while also emphasizing the need to preserve a key role for NATO, where American power and influence have been pre-eminent.
 
Striking Change of Tone
 With a striking change of tone, the later draft states, "One of the primary tasks we face today in shaping the future is carrying longstanding alliances into the new era, and turning old enmities into new cooperative relationships."
For the first time in the memory of military officials who have drafted policy, the new draft states that while a strong defense to deter potential foes will continue to be an important concept in American security, a leveling of military investment coupled with greater economic and security cooperation will create a more stable world.
"It is not in our interest or those of the other democracies to return to earlier periods in which multiple military powers balanced one another off in what passed for security structures, while regional, or even global peace hung in the balance," it said.
The new document places greater emphasis on international military cooperation, with a special emphasis on cooperation with Russia, Ukraine and the other republics of the former Soviet Union, as a means of providing "security at lower costs with lower risks for all."
The document, known as the Defense Planning Guidance for the 1994-99 fiscal years, has never been made public and parts of it are classified. It is a policy that is an internal planning guide for the Pentagon and prepared every two years. As such, it represents "guidance" from the President and the Secretary of Defense to the four military services on how to prepare their budgets and forces in the future.
 
Additional Refinements Made
 A senior Pentagon official, commenting on the April 16 draft, said that it "more carefully reflects" the thinking of Mr. Cheney, but that additional refinements and editing changes have been made since that version was circulated. He said the major elements remain.
Though Mr. Cheney signed the document Friday, it was not clear whether it would be subject to additional comment or revision after circulating to the White House and State Department.
The new draft continues to make the case for the Bush Administration's concept of a "base force" military of 1.6 million uniformed troops and rejects calls in Congress for a greater peace dividend that could be derived from deeper military cuts. And while it strengthens the Administration's commitment to act in concert with allies and through international bodies like the United Nations, it preserves a commitment "to act independently, as necessary, to protect our critical interests."
A central theme of the later draft, which echoes Mr. Cheney's and General Powell's public testimony, is that a precipitous decline in military spending could "break" the organizational competence of the American military and tempt adversaries like Iraq to seek to dominate critical regions.
 
Commitment to Israel
 The later draft also makes a specific commitment to the security of Israel and to providing Taiwan with modern military equipment.
The later version of the planning document, like its predecessor, calls on the four military services to be prepared to fight two major regional wars simultaneously while maintaining sizable military presence in Europe, where the old Soviet-led Warsaw Pact threat has disappeared.
"We must recognize what we are so often told by the leaders of the new democracies -- that continued U.S. presence in Europe is an essential part of the West's overall efforts to maintain stability even in the midst of such dramatic change," it states.
Even with significant adjustments, the later draft is likely to have little impact on the military services. The battle over the document's tone, emphasis and language is more a struggle of ideas about the future of American foreign policy and military strategy.
 
Potential Threats Reformulated
 The later draft, in stating potential threats, retreats to a more narrow formulation, which calls for the United States to prevent "any hostile power from dominating a region critical to our interests." It adds that such "consolidated, non-democratic control of the resources" in a region "could generate a significant threat to our security."
The February draft had stated that while the United States could not become the world's policeman in the future, "we will retain the pre-eminent responsibility for addressing selectively those wrongs which threaten not only our interests, but those of our allies or friends, or which could seriously unsettle international relations."
The later draft abandons the broad sweep and unilateral tone of the earlier draft and stresses a more narrow point that where possible, the United States will act in concert and cooperation with allies, "but we must maintain the capabilities for addressing selectively those security problems that threaten our own interests."
A specific goal of restraining India's "hegemonic aspirations" in South Asia also was dropped in the later draft in favor of language promoting a reduction of tensions between India and Pakistan.
 
Some Fine Nuances
 In some cases, the nuances of change in the new draft seem to draw distinctions without a difference. For instance, the new document drops the claim of an allied "victory" over the Soviet Union, a claim that former President Mikhail S. Gorbachev had criticized after the earlier document was made public. Instead, the new draft characterizes as a "great success" the overall discrediting of Communism as an ideology and the collapse of the Soviet empire.
But other changes in emphasis appeared to be driven by a more fundamental recognition that in the post-cold-war era, diplomatic and economic tools will become more effective instruments in international relations while military tools will recede to a lower status.
"Our tools include political and economic measures and others such as security assistance, military-to-military contacts, humanitarian aid and intelligence assistance, as well as security measures to prevent the emergence of a non-democratic aggressor in critical regions," the new draft states.
While the role of the United Nations was left unrecognized in the earlier draft, it is prominently mentioned in the new document, which says, "In this more secure international environment, there will be enhanced opportunities for political, economic, environmental, social and security issues to be resolved through new or revitalized international organizations, including the United Nations, or regional arrangements."

Chart: "Superpower Notion Gives Way to 'Collective' Approach"
 
Key Sections of Pentagon Document on Post-Cold-War Strategy
 
Initial Draft (Feb. 18, 1992)
 1) Our first objective is to prevent the re-emergence of a new rival, either on the territory of the former Soviet Union or elsewhere, that poses a threat on the order of that posed formerly by the Soviet Union. This is a dominant consideration underlying the new regional defense strategy and requires that we endeavor to prevent any hostile power from dominating a region whose resources would, under consolidated control, be sufficient to general global power.
 2) The U.S. must show the leadership necessary to establish and protect a new order that holds the promise of convincing potential competitors that they need not aspire to a greater role or pursue a more aggressive posture to protect their legitimate interests. In non-defense areas, we must account sufficiently for the interests of the advanced industrial nations to discourage them from challenging our leadership or seeking to overturn the established political and economic order. We must maintain the mechanism for deterring potential competitors from even aspiring to a larger regional or global role.
 3) Like the coalition that opposed Iraqi aggression, we should expect future coalitions to be ad hoc assemblies, often not lasting beyond the crisis being confronted, and in many cases carrying only general agreement over the objectives to be accomplished. Nevertheless, the sense that the world order is ultimately backed by the U.S. will be an important stabilizing factor.
 4) While the U.S. cannot become the world's policeman, by assuming responsibility for righting every wrong, we will retain the preeminent responsibility for addressing selectively those wrongs which threaten not only our interests, but those of our allies or friends, or which could seriously unsettle international relations.
 5) We continue to recognize that collectively the conventional forces of the states formerly comprising the Soviet Union retain the most military potential in all of Eurasia; and we do not dismiss the risks to stability in Europe from a nationalist backlash in Russia or efforts to reincorporate into Russia the newly independent republics of Ukraine, Belarus, and possibly others....We must, however, be mindful that democratic change in Russia is not irreversible, and that despite its current travails, Russia will remain the strongest military power in Eurasia and the only power in the world with the capability of destroying the United States.
 6) In the Middle East and Southwest Asia, our overall objective is to remain the predominant outside power in the region and preserve U.S. and Western access to the region's oil.
 
Latest Draft (April 16, 1992)
 1) Our most fundamental goal is to deter or defeat attack from whatever source. . .. The second goal is to strengthen and extend the system of defense arrangements that binds democratic and like-minded nations together in common defense against aggression, build habits of cooperation, avoid the renationalization of security policies, and provide security at lower costs and with lower risks for all. Our preference for a collective response to preclude threats or, if necessary, to deal with them is a key feature of our regional defense strategy. The third goal is to preclude any hostile power from dominating a region critical to our interests, and also thereby to strengthen the barriers against the re-emergence of a global threat to the interests of the U.S. and our allies.
 2) One of the primary tasks we face today in shaping the future is carrying long standing alliances into the new era, and turning old enmities into new cooperative relationships. If we and other leading democracies continue to build a democratic security community, a much safer world is likely to emerge. If we act separately, many other problems could result.
 3) Certain situations like the crisis leading to the Gulf War are likely to engender ad hoc coalitions. We should plan to maximize the value of such coalitions. This may include specialized roles for our forces as well as developing cooperative practices with others.
 4) While the United States cannot become the world's policeman and assume responsibility for solving every international security problem, neither can we allow our critical interests to depend solely on internation mechanisms that can be blocked by countries whose interests may be very different than our own. Where our allies interests are directly affected, we must expect them to take an appropriate share of the responsibility, and in some cases play the leading role; but we maintain the capabilities for addressing selectively those security problems that threaten our own interests.
 5) The U.S. has a significant stake in promoting democratic consolidation and peaceful relations between Russia, Ukraine and the other republics of the former Soviet Union.
 6) In the Middle East and Persian Gulf, we seek to foster regional stability, deter aggression against our friends and interests in the region, protect U.S. nationals and property, and safeguard our access to international air and seaways and to the region's oil. The United States is committed to the security of Israel and to maintaining the qualitative edge that is critical to Israel's security. Israel's confidence in its security and U.S.-Israel strategic cooperation contribute to the stability of the entire region, as demonstrated once again during the Persian Gulf War. At the same time, our assistance to our Arab friends to defend themselves against aggression also strengthens security throughout the region, including for Israel. (pg. 14)

HEADLINE: Official Summer Outlook Calls for Clean Shores and Big Crowds

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON

 BODY:
From Mystic to Cape May, from Fire Island to the Thousand Islands, the New York region is approaching the summer of 1992 with an optimism unseen in recent years, anticipating clean beaches and big crowds.
Just as a blast of hot weather this week quickly burned off the chill of a cold spring, officials are hopeful that their expanding fight against ocean pollution will result in a second straight trouble-free beach season, further dimming memories of the beach closing in 1987 and 1988 prompted by the washup of medical waste and other pollution problems. 
 The tourism industry, meanwhile, sees signs that people are shaking off the recession and taking more vacations. Many campgrounds are full this Memorial Day weekend, state park officials say. A survey of New Jersey resort rentals and hotel reservations show bookings are ahead of last year's pace, and New York City, buoyed by the upcoming Democratic National Convention and other events, is expecting a strong rebound from a bad 1991.
"There's a pent-up demand for travel," said Eugene Dilbeck, director of the New Jersey Division of Travel and Tourism. "I don't think there's any doubt we'll have excellent numbers. But the key will be how much they contribute to the economy on their trips. People are still budget-minded."
 
Heading for the Beach
 As the three-day holiday weekend began yesterday, temperatures climbed into the 90's, and hundreds of thousands of people jammed the highways and flocked to beaches, parks and shady retreats.
The temperature reached 92 in New York yesterday afternoon, short of the 94 degree record for the date set in 1964, but still hot enough for Gene Salerno, a National Weather Service meteorologist, to call it the best beach day of the weekend. Today was expected to be mostly cloudy, with a high in the 70's, and tomorrow's forecast called for a high in the low 60's.
After a drizzly spring, yesterday was like a light-speed jump to the middle of summer, and thousands of people seemed eager to get off to a fast start to the do-nothing season.
"It's Fourth of July weather," Milton Berger said as he looked out over vast crowds sprawled on the beach and strolling on the boardwalk and in the amusement areas at Coney Island, where he promotes the heart-stopping roller coaster known as the Cyclone and other attractions. "It's hot, but it's comfortable," he added. "It's air-conditioned by the Atlantic Ocean."
At Jones Beach, on the South Shore of Long Island, the Long Island State Park Commission estimated that more than 100,000 people were on the sand and in the surf. Scores of other Long Island beaches were open and crowded yesterday, though numbers were not available.
New Jersey's 127 miles of ocean beaches were also jammed yesterday, and the Greater Atlantic County Convention and Visitors Bureau estimated that two million people would be on the shore beaches during the three-day weekend.
In New York City, Parks Commissioner Betsy Gotbaum pronounced the city's 15 miles of freshly cleaned beaches "fabulous." And Dr. Margaret Hamburg, the city's Health Commissioner, said water quality had improved enough to permit swimming at Midland and South Beaches on Staten Island for the first time in 20 years.
Along the Jersey Shore, there is a resurgent confidence about ocean waters that only a few years ago evoked suspicion and fear in many people as sewage spills closed some beaches and dolphins died of a mysterious infection.
"I've been surfing here for 12 years, and this year it looks better than ever," Glenn Hamill said as he and his 7-year-old daughter, Amy, braved the cold surf in Seabright, N.J., on Friday. "It's the cleanest I've ever seen it."
Officials warn, however, that much of their hope for a successful summer depends the weather. The season got off to a slow start because the cold spring kept ocean temperatures under 50 degrees, and a summer of rain could ruin hopes for both clean beaches and crowded resorts.
Environmental officials are proud of their efforts to prevent or quickly clean up pollution from sewage-treatment plants and floating debris, whether spilled garbage, carelessly discarded syringes or rotting pier timbers.
Helicopters patrol New York Harbor and the shoreline south, watching for slicks of debris, and cleanup crews are sent out after moon tides and rain, which wash trash from the shore into the water.
 
Reducing Garbage Spills
 New York City has greatly reduced garbage spills by covering barges on their way to the Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island, laying booms around docking areas and sending out skimmer boats to pick up what does spill.
The Army Corps of Engineers is continuing to remove rotting piers from the Arthur Kill and New Jersey has continued a shoreline cleanup in which prison inmates, in their first two months this year, picked up 1,600 tons of timbers and other trash along 18 miles of waterfront.
In March 1991, New Jersey stopped dumping sewage sludge at sea, meeting its own deadline, and New York City is taking steps to end its sludge dumping by a June 30 Federal deadline.
As a result of these efforts, only one beach in New York and New Jersey was closed last summer because of washed-up debris.
 
More Difficult Tasks
 But officials say the easiest, most obvious steps to prevent pollution have been taken. Continued progress, they say, depends on two difficult long-term tasks: spending billions of dollars to separate sewer lines and storm drains so that rainwater can no longer overwhelm sewage-treatment plants; and educating the public that even flicking away a cigarette butt on a city street can result in a dirty beach.
Margaret Randol, a spokeswoman for the regional office of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, said a study done for New York City estimated that as many as 1.2 million "floatables" -- anything from a cigarette butt to a log -- may enter New York Harbor each month.
More than 80 percent of that debris, she said, comes from sewer overflows or is flushed out of storm drains by rain runoff. The runoff can also carry animal feces, oil, chemicals and other pollutants.
Environmental agencies have begun a campaign to tell the public how litter and other waste can be flushed out to sea and end up on beaches.
"Back in 1987 and 1988, a lot of people thought much of the beach wash-ups were materials dumped illegally," Ms. Randol said. "But our research showed that was not the case. Much of it was just stuff from the streets."
 
Shorter Trips
 A relatively dry summer will help beaches by limiting the rain that can overwhelm sewage-treatment plants and flush out storm drains.
Despite the recession, officials say, people are determined to take vacations, and if they continue a trend toward more day trips and shorter, though more frequent, vacations, that should mean good business for resorts surrounding the New York area, with its 20 million people.
"The indications are that people will travel more by car, take shorter trips, and are going to be thrifty," said Joseph Cohen, a spokesman for the Connecticut Department of Economic Development. "That works extremely well for Connecticut tourist attractions, but it does mean that some parts of the industry will have to work harder."
A New Jersey survey of shore resorts found summer rentals and hotel reservations as much as 10 percent to 15 percent ahead of last year. Rental agents on Long Island also report an improvement over 1991.
This optimism comes even as New York, New Jersey and Connecticut have cut back on their promotion of tourism because of budget problems.

HEADLINE: Inflation Outpaced Doctors' Income in '90

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: CHICAGO, May 23

 BODY:
Doctors' average income rose $8,500 in 1990, to $164,300, according to a study by the American Medical Association.
The 5.5 percent increase over the 1989 average of $155,800 was less than the 6.1 percent rate of inflation that year. 
 Surgeons had the highest salaries, averaging $236,400, and radiologists were next, at $219,400. Lowest-paid were general practitioners and family practitioners, who averaged $102,700 and $106,500, respectively.
As in previous years, rural doctors earned less than their urban colleagues, averaging $130,500, compared with $163,300 for doctors in areas with more than a million residents. Doctors in metropolitan areas with less than a million people earned an average of $172,700.
The study also found that doctors in the depressed New England region averaged $142,500, $21,800 less than the national average. Doctors fared best in the region comprising Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas and Oklahoma, where pay averaged $178,800.
The figures were issued Wednesday in the A.M.A.'s Socioeconomic Monitoring System Report. The A.M.A. monitors, based in Chicago, surveyed more than 4,000 doctors practicing at least 20 hours a week, but excluded those employed by the Federal Government.

HEADLINE: Nautical Question Decides Geography Bee

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 23

 BODY:
With a perfect record in two days of competition, 13-year-old Lawson Fite of Vancouver, Wash., won the National Geography Bee on Thursday.
Lawson, an eighth grader at Shumway Middle School, won after a tight battle with Geoffrey Hatchard, 13, of Cresco, Pa. 
 The deciding match came when the boys were asked to identify the initials E.E.Z., described as the areas that extend 200 nautical miles from the shore of many coastal countries that claim sovereign rights over those areas for resource exploration.
Lawson said "Exclusive Economic Zone." Geoffrey, who had already missed an earlier question, said "Environmental Economic Zones."
Nearly six million students in the sixth through the eighth grades competed in the various levels of the 1992 National Geography Bee. The 57 finalists, who began the last round of competition here on Wednesday, represented the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Defense Department schools and five American territories.
The Geography Bee's sponsors are National Geographic World, the National Geographic Society's magazine for children, and Amtrak, the nation's intercity passenger railroad.
As the winner, Lawson gets a $25,000 college scholarship and round-trip, first-class tickets for four to any Amtrak destination.

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, May 23

 BODY:
The Bush Administration's move to increase pressure on the Yugoslav Government was met with official silence here today. But continued fighting by Serbian forces in Bosnia pointed to a determination not to yield to the threat of tightening sanctions.
Mr. Milosevic's Government appeared to be watching closely to see how far the European Community's members would go in pressing new economic sanctions. 
 A senior adviser to Mr. Milosevic, Zeljko Simic, described the latest American moves as "undemocratic," because the United States, ge argued, had singled out Serbia for punishment and taken no action against Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia or Slovenia.
Although the American steps have a deep resonance here, their effect seems to be largely political, as they focused on increasing Serbia's diplomatic isolation.
If sanctions are to have a major practical effect, diplomats here in Belgrade say, they will have to come from the European Community, since it is with Europe that Serbia and Montenegro have the bulk of their trade.
The only new American measure that had a direct effect on the Serbian economy was the decision to suspend flights by the Yugoslav national airline, JAT, to New York and Chicago, And the effect of that was likely to be small, as long as Canada permitted the airline to continue twice-weekly flights to Montreal and Toronto.
If the European nations adopt any of the measures that have been discussed by senior European Community officials in recent days, including a trade embargo, a freeze on assets, or an oil embargo, the effect would be more severe. But few diplomats here believe that economic sanctions are likely to decisively change the Serbian Government's course on Bosnia.
They say that the Serbian economy was severely damaged by the fighting last year in Croatia and Slovenia, and more so by the more recent Bosnian warfare. Despite this damage, they say, Mr. Milosevic has shown no sign yet of subordinating his Serbian nationalist goals to economic considerations.

HEADLINE: MAY 17-23: Dropouts;
Truant Officers or Jobs Are Keeping Them in School

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
So much fretting goes on over the state of the nation's schools and the ignorance of American students that it's easy to miss the good news that sometimes comes along.
Last week, New York City, the nation's largest school system, reported a sharp drop in its dropout rate. And the Council of Great City Schools, comprising the 47 largest systems, said New York was leading a nationwide revival; two-thirds of its members also kept more students in school. New York did particularly well in comparisons of how many students quit last year: 6.8 percent versus 16 percent in Los Angeles and 13.2 percent in Chicago. 
 Many educators, including New York's Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez, believe high schools are learning how to hang on to youngsters for up to seven years until they graduate. Expensive programs that chase and counsel truant and failing students are finally paying off -- some schools even have machines that dial students' homes with taped messages saying they are absent. Diane Ravitch, an Assistant United States Secretary of Education, also thinks more rigorous academic requirements have shown students that they are being taken seriously.
But even Mr. Fernandez credited part of his success to the scarcity of jobs luring students away. The painful paradox is that if a revived economy were to give Mr. Fernandez the money to improve schools it might also beguile more students to drop out.

HEADLINE: A Blueprint of the Future Along the Hudson River

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
In the three decades since the West Side piers bristled with waterborne commerce, New York City has been trying to revive the decaying Hudson River shoreline. For the most part, the efforts have produced one failed plan after another, seemingly as numerous as the stark pilings that mark the voids where piers once stood.
But in the last few weeks, a series of proposals and decisions have come forth that have the potential for remaking much of the West Side waterfront, from Battery Park City to West 72d Street. 
 As a result, it is possible to sketch a conceptual tour of Manhattan's future Hudson River shoreline, where parks and recreational piers may someday alternate with massive low-rise structures and tall towers.
None of these visions may come to pass, since complicated political and financial obstacles must be crossed. And any of the projects that get built will almost certainly have been altered by the time the ribbons are cut.
But there has been movement.
 
A Series of Announcements
 On Monday, city planners certified that Donald J. Trump's proposal for a new riverfront neighborhood from 59th to 72d Street, called Riverside South, was ready for public review.
Then Gov. Mario M. Cuomo signed an agreement with Mayor David N. Dinkins on a plan to redevelop the shoreline from Battery Park City to 59th Street. The prime agent would be the Hudson River Park Conservancy, a subsidiary of the state Urban Development Corporation and successor to the West Side Waterfront Panel, which drew up the redevelopment plans. The director-designate is Tom Fox, executive director of the Neighborhood Open Space Coalition.
And on Friday, three bids were accepted by the state Transportation Department for the redevelopment of the Chelsea Piers, with proposals that included ice-skating rinks, studios, a marina and a yachting school.
Earlier this month, the State Court of Appeals cleared a major legal obstacle from the path of a proposed development by Larry A. Silverstein on the waterfront at 42d Street. And early next month, the North Park at Battery Park City is to open to the public, creating a pedestrian route along the water's edge from the financial district to TriBeCa.
 
Many Questions Raised
 Imagining the future of the West Side waterfront, Barbara J. Fife, the deputy mayor for planning and development, said: "You would have a ribbon of green going all the way up. It will probably be the most spectacular waterfront in the world. It will certainly be the most significant."
Critics and skeptics abound, however. There are also fears that the commercial and residential development could have significant unwanted impacts on the environment and on existing neighborhoods.
"We're very, very much for the ribbon of green," said Marcy Benstock, executive director of the Clean Air Campaign. "Instead, what's being proposed is to defer the park into the 21st century while holding the waterfront for real-estate speculation."
And Ruth W. Messinger, Borough President of Manhattan, said, "To be talking too terribly seriously about which elements do or do not belong on the waterfront, meet current housing needs or fit with the ambience of the West Side begs the big-ticket question: What the hell are they going to do with the sewage?"
The debate has only begun. But if the projects are to happen as now envisioned, a trip up the West Side might unfold like this:
 
BATTERY-FINANCIAL DISTRICT
 Battery Park, at the tip of Manhattan, would be given new life under a $22-million reconstruction that would, among other things, extend the greenery closer to the water's edge and expand it to and across adjacent streets. But there is no money budgeted for this project.
Another plan calls for the conversion of the historic Pier A into restaurants and a visitor's center.
At the tip of Battery Park City, a design team has been hired to plan South Park. The proposed Living Memorial to the Holocaust-Museum of Jewish Heritage would be nearby.
The eight-acre North Park, with lawns, basketball courts and handball courts, a continuation of the esplanade, a lookout pavilion, a playground and a lily pool, is to open June 4. Stuyvesant High School nearby is to open in September.
 
TRIBECA
 Between Stuyvesant High School and Pier 25, the waterfront panel has proposed an area for court games such as basketball and tennis. Piers 25 and 26 would be open to the public.
An "ecological" park would stretch from Pier 26 to Canal Street. This park would be bordered at the north by a new pier running to the ventilating shaft for the Holland Tunnel.
 
GREENWICH VILLAGE
 The waterfront panel has designated Pier 40, at Houston Street, a 16-acre structure with a awarehouse and garage, as one of three major building sides. The panel specified a maximum development of 1.775 million square feet -- 1.535 million square feet residential and 240,000 square feet commercial -- and a maximum building height of 85 feet (eight or nine stories). But it left open the question of whether Pier 40 would be best used commercially or residentially. Under the densest residential scenario, there would be about 1,700 apartments.
A park, punctuated by four public recreation piers, would stretch from Leroy to Gansevoort Street.
CHELSEA
The second major development site proposed by the waterfront panel involves three of the four Chelsea Piers. On June 15, the state is to announce the winner of Friday's auction, which involves a 10-year lease. The longer-term future could hold a rehabilitation of the existing structure or large-scale construction involving 720,000 square feet of new residential space (about 800 units) and 110,000 square feet of renovated commercial space.
To the north the panel has proposed an eight-acre Chelsea Waterside Park, which it called the "largest and most active recreation area" between Battery Park City and Riverside South. The park would be bounded roughly by 11th Avenue and the river, 21st and 24th Streets, and bisected by Route 9A. Piers at the north and south ends of the park would be open to the public.
 
CONVENTION CENTER-CLINTON
 Pier 66, at the foot of 26th Street, would be used as a heliport, under the panel's plan. A waterfront park would follow, to 35th Street. East of this park is the Caemmerer West Side Yard, used by the Long Island Rail Road, above which the Metropolitan Transportation Authority has envisioned office and apartment towers and a hotel, in a project now dormant.
On Pier 76, now a tow pound, a development team headed by Julien J. Studley has proposed the Hudson River Center, a hotel of approximately 40 stories, linked by bridge to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. Those plans, too, seem moribund.
The third of the development sites proposed by the waterfront panel would be Piers 81, 83 and 84, where a commercial complex might be built, offering berths for cruise and charter boats, as well as dining and entertainment. There would be an amphitheater between Piers 83 and 84.
To the east of this site is a full block owned by Silverstein Properties, which has been devising a 1.6-million-square-foot commercial, residential and institutional project. The required rezoning was upheld by the state's highest court May 5 against an environmental challenge by neighborhood residents.
Mr. Fox said that no more than two of the three piers of the New York City Passenger Ship Terminal complex are needed today.
The Clinton waterfront park would run between Piers 94 and 97, with the two intervening piers demolished.
 
UPPER WEST SIDE
 With that, Mr. Trump's Riverside South project would begin. At the southern end of the site would be an enormous commercial structure, two blocks wide, with 1.8 million square feet of studio space and two 30-story office towers at the eastern end.
Sixteen apartment buildings, up to 49 stories tall, would stretch from 59th to 72d Street. All told, there would be 5,700 housing units and a population of about 10,550.
A 22-acre park is the centerpiece of this proposal, which Mr. Trump undertook with six civic organizations. But the park depends on the relocation of the West Side Highway from its elevated riverfront viaduct to a curving inland route. That, like so many assumptions behind the visions of the waterfront, is eagerly awaited but far from a sure thing.

Kathy Phillips and Jake Daehler

BYLINE: By Lois Smith Brady

 BODY:
WHEN Jake Daehler, a 33-year-old actor, met Kathy Phillips, a 31-year-old actress and bike messenger, it was not love but fear at first sight.
"We met four years ago in an acting class," Mr. Daehler said. "Kathy was this totally wild person. She hitchhiked. She went hang gliding. She ran with the bulls in Spain. I remember I saw her on the street once: She was on her bike, smoking a cigarette and wearing this nutty Mary Poppins hat and a cat suit. I thought, 'She's cute but probably criminally insane.' " 
 Mr. Daehler is the opposite: a self-described Felix Unger type who always uses a place mat at dinner and drove a station wagon when he was a teen-ager. "I love his manners and his control," Mrs. Daehler said. "He loves my out-of-control."
Last Saturday they were married at the Biodome, a loft-and-rooftop space in a brownstone on East 34th Street in Manhattan. The Rev. Claire North performed the rooftop ceremony, which was written partly by Mr. Daehler and included lines like: "Your journey together has often been bumpy, especially in the last couple of weeks" and "This marriage is truly a testament to the effectiveness of the psychoanalytic process." (Both Mr. and Mrs. Daehler are in couples therapy, group therapy and psychoanalysis.)
After they were pronounced "wife and husband," most of the guests headed down to the loft, but Patricia Scanlon, a playwright, lingered. Wearing a black-velvet dress and lavender boots, she said: "That was such a funny, unpretentious ceremony. It was so Jake and Kathy. They didn't hide the fact that having a relationship is tough stuff."
The bride, who was also on the roof, suddenly lifted her Victorian dress to reveal brown lace-up boots, neon-green socks, a garter belt and a snake tattoo on her right thigh.
In the loft, many of the guests were under 40 and simpatico -- man or woman -- with the Julia Roberts or Darryl Hannah philosophy of dressing: mismatched skirts and tops, cowboy boots, thrift-shop jackets and retro eyeglasses.
Guy Veryzer, a ceramics artist, wore six medallions picturing Greek gods around his neck. "They're my past lives," he explained. Several people introduced themselves using slashes, as in "I'm a stand-up comic slash photographer slash aerobics instructor."
At one point, Mr. Daehler gave a speech in honor of his new wife. He quoted a J. D. Salinger story in which the narrator advises the reader, "Never marry no ordinary dame. . . ."
During dinner -- vegetarian lasagna and Caesar salad -- most of the guests gathered in the kitchen, where there was the kind of camaraderie you might find in the smoky back room of a small-town cafe. Everyone drank wine out of plastic cups and used paper plates.
"This is a very Bush, very recession, no-frills wedding," said Ben Dimmitt, a photographer. "It's just a bunch of people sitting around seeing each other."
Before the carrot cake was cut, the bride and groom's psychotherapists each delivered toasts. The groom's therapist began: "When I first met Jake, he used to dream he was bald. This obviously did not correspond with any reality."
She added: "But Kathy is perfect for Jake. He is now a guy who no longer feels bald."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Personal Finances;
Perot Reneged on Pledge to Reagan

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KELLY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 23

 BODY:
A little more than a year after pledging $2.5 million to support President Ronald Reagan's official library, in thanks for the President's "years of outstanding leadership and service," Ross Perot reneged on most of the pledge in 1987 because he apparently was angry over what he saw as a lack of interest in American servicemen missing in Southeast Asia.
The episode suggests the importance of Mr. Perot's experiences with the prisoner-of-war and missing-in-action issue in changing his feelings toward the Reagan Administration and then Vice President George Bush, whom Mr. Perot now seeks to replace in the White House. 
 Mr. Perot's financial involvement with the $60 million Ronald Reagan Presidential Library began March 6, 1986, when he wrote a letter to President and Mrs. Reagan at the White House, saying that his family had decided to support the privately financed library because Mr. Reagan had been "such a great President."
 
A Letter of Superlatives
 His family, Mr. Perot wrote to Mr. Reagan, had asked him to:
"Thank you for making us proud to be Americans again.
"Thank you for your leadership in lifting our nation's sense of destiny above the day-to-day problems that surround us.
"Thank you for reminding us that we are our brothers' keeper, and that we must help one another.
"As the leader of the free world, thank you for keeping us at peace.
"Thank you for stabilizing the economy, dramatically reducing inflation, and interest rates and creating an environment where most Americans have secure, stable jobs."
Mr. Perot went on to thank Nancy Reagan for her "great work in caring for the families of the men who were prisoners of war in Vietnam and for mobilizing the nation to protect children from drugs."
He then wrote that "the Perot family pledges $2.5 million to the Reagan Library to thank and honor both of you for your years of outstanding leadership and service to our nation and the world,"
 
Pressing Interest in P.O.W.'s
 Mr. Perot donated $500,000 as an initial payment toward his pledge, James Squires, the spokesman for Mr. Perot Presidential drive, said today and left $2 million outstanding.
At the time, Mr. Perot was passionately concerned with the P.O.W.-M.I.A. issue. For years he had held a strong view that American servicemen, perhaps hundreds of them, were secretly held prisoner in Southeast Asia and that American officials knew this but were unwilling, for various reasons, to act on it.
Mr. Perot discussed the matter with Vice President Bush, and he has said, in interviews, that Mr. Bush asked him to conduct a study of Government P.O.W.-M.I.A files, to determine if American officials were doing a good job. His search led him into confrontations with Federal officials over the best strategy for negotiating with Vietnam to win the release of any Americans still held captive and the remains of those American prisoners who had died in North and South Vietnam.
 
Crucial Visit to Hanoi
 In March 1987, Mr. Perot went to Hanoi, Vietnam, to continue his work on the issue, a trip he has said in previous interviews that he undertook with the blessing of the White House.
That trip, and his disappointment in the Government's reaction to it, was the turning point in Mr. Perot's relationship with the Reagan Administration and led directly to the cancellation of his pledge to the Reagan library.
"Perot came back convinced that we could deal effectively with the Vietnamese," Mr. Squires said, "but he found when he returned that the Reagan Administration would not take the trip seriously. He gave a report to the Reagan Administration criticizing its policies and soon after that he canceled his pledges."
Mr. Perot could not be reached today to discuss the issue. According to an account in The Washington Post last month, he has said he reneged on the pledge because of his disgust over the Iran-contra affair, which began to come to light in November 1986, and not because of the P.O.W-M.I.A. issue
Mr. Squires said Mr. Perot "became unhappy with Reagan and Bush" for several reasons, including the matter of arms sales to Iran and undercover aid to the Nicaraguan rebels. But he added that Mr. Perot's anger over the Administration's handling of the P.O.W.-M.I.A. issue and its response to his trip to Hanoi were central to his turning against the President he had so highly praised the year before.

The park would be bounded roughly by 11th Avenue and the river, 21st and 24th Streets, and bisected by Route 9A. Piers at the north and south ends of the park would be open to the public.

 Pier 66, at the foot of 26th Street, would be used as a heliport, under the panel's plan. A waterfront park would follow, to 35th Street. East of this park is the Caemmerer West Side Yard, used by the Long Island Rail Road, above which the Metropolitan Transportation Authority has envisioned office and apartment towers and a hotel, in a project now dormant.
On Pier 76, now a tow pound, a development team headed by Julien J. Studley has proposed the Hudson River Center, a hotel of approximately 40 stories, linked by bridge to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. Those plans, too, seem moribund.
The third of the development sites proposed by the waterfront panel would be Piers 81, 83 and 84, where a commercial complex might be built, offering berths for cruise and charter boats, as well as dining and entertainment. There would be an amphitheater between Piers 83 and 84.
To the east of this site is a full block owned by Silverstein Properties, which has been devising a 1.6-million-square-foot commercial, residential and institutional project. The required rezoning was upheld by the state's highest court May 5 against an environmental challenge by neighborhood residents.
Mr. Fox said that no more than two of the three piers of the New York City Passenger Ship Terminal complex are needed today.
The Clinton waterfront park would run between Piers 94 and 97, with the two intervening piers demolished.
 
UPPER WEST SIDE
 With that, Mr. Trump's Riverside South project would begin. At the southern end of the site would be an enormous commercial structure, two blocks wide, with 1.8 million square feet of studio space and two 30-story office towers at the eastern end.
Sixteen apartment buildings, up to 49 stories tall, would stretch from 59th to 72d Street. All told, there would be 5,700 housing units and a population of about 10,550.
A 22-acre park is the centerpiece of this proposal, which Mr. Trump undertook with six civic organizations. But the park depends on the relocation of the West Side Highway from its elevated riverfront viaduct to a curving inland route. That, like so many assumptions behind the visions of the waterfront, is eagerly awaited but far from a sure thing.

HEADLINE: FOCUS;
A Downtown Started for Rural Retirees

BYLINE: By LYN RIDDLE

DATELINE: SANTEE, S.C.

 BODY:
Like many rural areas around the nation, this town of 650 people has seen hundreds of retirees move in in recent years, not only to specially designed retirement communities, but also to scattered houses beside Lake Marion or one of three championship golf courses.
Now the town, halfway between Charleston and Columbia, wants to give something special to its new residents: a downtown. Because Santee was built up first as a resort and only later as a retirement community, it has never had what is commonly considered a downtown. 
 So last month, in a cornfield not far from the existing town hall, Santee began grading roads around what will become a village green. The first building in a project that is expected to cost $3 million will be a 3,500-square-foot town hall, which will rise later this year financed by a loan and an expected grant from a South Carolina utility company.
A police station, library, literacy center and a dozen commercial buildings will be built as public and private money becomes available. They will be similar in design to those in Colonial Williamsburg, Va.
While a downtown built from scratch is a rarity, multimillion-dollar projects, from shopping malls to nursing homes to hospitals, have been rising in the nation's small towns to serve the increasing number of retirees now making their homes there.
From Kingstree, S.C., to Guntersville, Ala., to Crossville, Tenn., the Southeast has become especially popular. Its low cost of living, especially for housing, has lured retirees, not only from the North and Middle West, but also from the traditional retirement areas of Florida and Arizona and Hawaii.
"Nobody expected this," said Peg Thompson, whose Huntsville, Ala., consulting firm helps market retirement areas. "Many towns would have drifted away, but these retirees bring the needed energy and intelligence to a dying town."
Analysts say 32 million people in the United States are 65 or older and about 7 percent of retirees move after quitting work. Mrs. Thompson said a large percentage of them are moving to the "sticks," either to a retirement community centered on some sort of leisure activity, like Santee, or to a small town, like Kingstree, S.C..
Bill Irish, who retired in 1984 after a career selling railway supplies, came here from Franklinville, N.J., looking for good fishing and occasional golf, but has since become the principal fund-raiser for Santee's downtown project.
"I recall getting up one morning and seeing snow and I thought it was time to get away from all that," he said. He and his wife, Catherine, paid about $90,000 for a 1,200-square-foot house in Bradford Village, a retirement community with a pool, clubhouse and tennis courts. The 110 houses there, all sold, were priced from $85,000 to $110,000.
There are two other housing developments. Santee Resort with 244 one-family houses and a golf-course was built and sold over the last two decades; Chapel Creek Plantation, with a mix of 350 one-family houses and patio homes, is now under construction. Eleven houses and 40 lots have been sold. Its golf course has been completed, but houses are being built only after the lots are sold.
Nevertheless, the town remains little more than an interchange on Interstate 95, about halfway between New York and Miami. Long home to cotton and wheat farmers, its development began in the 1940's with a handful of small motels and some restaurants designed to cater to the New York-to-Miami travelers. Fishermen trying to snare the landlocked striped bass, a freshwater game fish, from Lake Marion brought more development, then, later, the retirees brought still more.
Because growth was unplanned, it became a "hodgepodge commercial area," including an outlet shopping mall, some stand-alone small stores and restaurants, said Bill Clark, a local architect who donated the plans and part of the land for the downtown and is chairman of the Main Street Project. He broached the idea of fixing up the old town hall several years ago after seeing how seedy it looked on a local television report.
"Now the plans have turned into something that is right big and grand," said Mr. Clark, who built Chapel Creek Plantation as well as Santee National Golf Course.
Added Mr. Irish: "The growth possibilities are enormous once we get the downtown built." A state study showed that once the downtown is completed it will draw even more tourists and retirees and create 5,000 jobs and $110 million in new revenue. Already, a million tourists come here each year.
All the developments here have been built by local companies, but some national firms, among them Cooper Communities of Bella Vista, Ark., have grown into lucrative businesses by building retirement villages in rural areas with scenic attractions.
Cooper Communities built three resorts in the Ozarks in Arkansas and one in Tennessee and its newest development is now rising in McCormick, a small town in southwestern South Carolina. There, nearly 50 homes have been built over the last two years on the Lake Thurmond shore. When finished, the development will have 6,000 lots, ranging in price from $7,000 to $136,000.
Mrs. Thompson said this type of development has probably reached its peak as a result of lenders' misgivings about real estate projects in general. Large companies with the ability to finance their own projects will be the only ones developing in the 90's, she said.
"There will be no large-scale resort development until the baby boomers hit 50," she said.
Small towns, meanwhile, have been equally successful in luring retirees, even without specially designed retirement communities.
Pat Mason, the executive director of the South Carolina Retirement Association, said one of the main necessities cited by retirees is not golf, tennis or high-living, but walking paths.
"And what do small towns offer?" he said. "Sidewalks. Small towns are not going to get much industry, that's just a fact, but retirement can be one of the things that can add magnetism to a town's growth."
With 4,000 residents, Kingstree remains a quaint Southern town with antebellum homes and a bustling Main Street. It's newest citizens are retirees, many of whom discovered the town through an advertisement in Modern Maturity, the magazine of the American Association of Retired Persons.
About 550 inquiries were received, and perhaps 10 people moved to the town, which was settled in 1732 by makers of ship's masts who found in the Black River basin stands of tall, straight pine trees. Kingstree is about 45 miles due west of Myrtle Beach.
Mr. Mason's group says 10 retirees have the same effect on the economy as a company employing five people. Surveys show that the average retiree spends $135,000 on a house and deposits $22,000 into the local bank.
Other towns have had similar success. In Guntersville, population 7,000, about 25 retirees have moved in to take advantage of low housing costs. A typical house on Lake Guntersville, about 35 miles south of Huntsville, costs $65,000, although much larger lakefront homes sell for as much as $300,000.
And in Crossville, four retirement communities have been built over the last two decades on a mountain plateau in the center of the state. The town of 7,000 people offers mountain scenery, mild weather and low taxes, according to the Chamber of Commerce.
"There's not a state in the nation without a resort area that has attracted a fair amount of retirees," said Mrs. Thompson. "The big asset is the real estate."

HEADLINE: Returnees' 'Stuff' Overflows Houses

BYLINE: By JUDY GLASS

 BODY:
WHEN Janet Kranik's son, a college student from Northport, arrived home for the summer with a van loaded with a roomful of furniture, a stereo, books, supplies and boxes of clothes, his mother would not let him into the house.
"Don't even stop," Ms. Kranik told her son, instructing him to deposit everything at a nearby storage warehouse. Ms. Kranik recalled how she had spent the prior summer tripping over his things and vying for room. 
 "When they leave home, you get used to having everything in its place and having it stay there," she said. "We had a much more enjoyable visit this time."
Andy Cadel's graduation from the University of Virginia Law School this month was the first in a series of moves that he expects to make in the next few months. Rather than clutter his parents' house in Oceanside with the contents of his apartment at school, he had the mover go directly to GLG Mini-Storage in Island Park, where he rented a 5-foot-by-15-foot space for $76 a month, and "everything fit perfectly," he said.
Mr. Cadel is moving into a studio in Greenwich Village for the summer while he studies for the bar and will then take off on a cross-country motorcycle trip before starting a job at the law firm of Weil, Gotshal & Manges in Manhattan.
"I can peel things out of the bin as I need them," he said, "without dumping onto my parents." On his own for four years, Mr. Cadel said he expected to make one more move, to a larger apartment, in New York City, and "this arrangement gives me a lot of flexibility."
Temporary self-storage warehouses, springing up in many parts of Long Island, are intended to meet the needs of an increasing number of residents who are squeezed for space in their houses or who have become part of the mobile society that relocates frequently. Their use also reflects changing styles of life and real-estate patterns.
Every summer college students coming home to Long Island when they are out of school or leaving local colleges to fly home, use storage centers for temporary safekeeping, said Thomas Hinck, manager of GLG and County Seat Storage in Mineola.
The arrangement is particularly popular with families on the Nassau-Queens border, where cooperatives and condominiums often cannot accommodate additional furniture, said Mark Trifon, owner and manager of Store More in New Hyde Park, who charges $81 a month for a 5-foot by 10-foot space.
Storage warehouses are "a mini-real estate situation," said Janet Kranik, project manager for Public Storage in Northport, part of a nationwide chain with 10 centers in Suffolk County. The renters represent a cross-section of people and adapting to changing circumstances.
Years ago people's lives and living arrangements were more stable and predictable, said Barbara Roberts, a broker at Flynn Realty in Kings Park and a director of the Long Island Board of Realtors.
But traditional ownership cycles have changed in the last 10 years. "In the past," Mrs. Roberts said of housing in her area, "a young couple bought their first three-bedroom home in a development when their children were young. As their income rose and they needed more room for the growing family, they'd move to a four-bedroom colonial north of 25A and sell the small home to another young family. If they really prospered, they'd move up to Fort Salonga, until their teen-agers left the nest."
People nearing retirement who wanted to "downsize" without leaving Long Island often bought smaller houses on the North Fork, Mrs. Roberts said, rather than move to places like Florida, so that they could stay near their adult children and their families. Today, she said, young people cannot afford to buy houses on the Island or, because of high taxes, have to find smaller housing, consolidate their assets or move away.
Faced with the loss of thousands of jobs on the Island, Mrs. Roberts said, younger families are putting job opportunities first and leaving without knowing whether the move is temporary or permanent.
 
Those Overflowing Closets
 For families who move to smaller houses when the children go to college, a major problem may be what to do with closets full of trophies, toys, records and other memorabilia amassed over the years. The children may say, "Dump it," but their parents often refuse. The entire collection is likely to wind up in a warehouse, which will usually accept almost any items that are not hazardous or risky to other renters, said Ms. Kranik, who is a project manager for Public Storage, a year-old warehouse in Northport with 800 units. But storage is not a place for treasures. Insurance is limited.
Some people, although contemplating an ideal retirement home or savoring a future without responsibilities, find that they cannot leave the homestead, after all.
For a variety of reasons, grown children are returning to the family houses with their own children, and many families on Long Island, Mrs. Roberts said, are combining households because they cannot afford to maintain separate houses.
A college graduate would rather spend a low salary on recreation than rent, she said, and married children transferring to out-of-state jobs or dividing assets in divorces often return for weeks, months or years.
Sometimes the surviving spouses of parents who have just died go to live with the families "temporarily," but cannot bear to part with family treasures. "I can't tell you how many houses we inspect that have another full house in the basement," Mrs. Roberts said.
 
Demand for Space
 "What can you do with furniture for two living rooms, two sets of appliances and duplicates of pots, pans and dishes?" asked Joanne Hendricks, an agent for Storage Masters, a warehouse in Huntington.
Storage Masters is expanding its two-year-old site.
"Statistics on consolidation, downsizing and upsizing in the Long Island real-estate market don't exist," Mrs. Roberts said. "It's strictly anecdotal, but the fuel companies and electrical utilities keep track, and we are observing it."
Years ago people may have rejected consolidating or sharing their large houses. But now having done so with family members or noting the increasing number of rentals on Long Island, such moves become more viable solutions.
Prospective tenants who are divorced or were formerly homeowners may deposit their half of the property in a warehouse and move a house. They are not ready to part with their belongings permanently.
Downsizing, or moving to a smaller house, is increasingly a choice for those who want to stay on Long Island and relish their privacy, but no longer want high maintenance costs, said Mrs. Roberts, who moved to a smaller house between marriages.
"I felt independent," she said, "because I could handle the work and still have a home of my own."
"Warehouse space costs a lot less than buying a new home or renting more office space," said Lisa Crane, a marketing manager for Public Storage. The California company has more than 1,000 sites nationwide.
"There was opposition to the facility on Route 25A and Fort Salonga Road in Northport when it was first proposed because it's in a residential neighborhood," Ms. Crane said. "Now it's being used by doctors, dentists and businesses to store inactive files and equipment, as well as by families. Executors of estates sometimes use it as a central location for family members who want access to the effects at almost any time."
 
Few Comforts of Home
 THE rooms for rent have no heat, no light and no ventilation, but there is so much demand for them on Long Island that two buildings with about 1,000 units have been constructed within 15 miles of each other in the last two years.
The storage warehouses in Northport and Huntington can be a practical economical solution for an increasingly migratory population that is moving around on and relocating to the Island, breaking up large family homes to move to smaller residences and coping with the effects of divorces, deaths and departures of the young.
Professionals and businesses use them to store inactive files, and executors use them to centralize effects for visiting family members.
The classified telephone directory lists about 50 public-storage warehouses on the Island, not counting storage at moving companies.
At Storage Masters in Huntington, video cameras scan the long black corridors of metal doors with locks, and no one gains access without a photo-identification card. At Public Storage in Northport, renters enter the gates with cards that register on a computer. If the card is stolen, there will be a record of entry.
Managers live at the site to "keep a high profile," warehousers say. Renters are responsible for locks and access to their units.
A 5 x 10 x 8 room can be rented at Storage Masters for $67.60 a month. At Public Storage, that approximate space rents for about $50 a month. With little variation in price, renters usually choose locations closest to home.
"You can cram a lot in a small space if you're a good stacker," one manager said.
Renters cannot store chemicals, paints or other potentially dangerous materials, but the warehouses do not inspect the items unless there is a suspicious leak or odor.
Warehouses are not places for items that belong in safe-deposit boxes. The warehouses are insured only for damages caused by their negligence. Some homeowners' policies cover possessions off-site. Renters can also purchase insurance.

HEADLINE: Realtors Say the 90's Mood Is Sober

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

DATELINE: HASTINGS-ON-HUDSON

 BODY:
IT began with a wrong turn off a highway. With that and what they have come to call "the souring of their romance with city life." David Nelson and Jazan Higgins, executives with publishing concerns in Manhattan, were driving in the county one Sunday afternoon last spring when they found themselves on Main Street here. The couple recalled coming upon a sleepy village with the charm of a bygone era -- a quaintness, they said, that no amount of money could buy in New York City.
They also remembered looking at pictures of houses for sale in the windows of Peter J. Riolo Inc., a Hastings real-estate concern, and asking each other, "Why not?" 
 That "Why not?" led, they said, to a river view, a five-minute walk to the train station and a 33-minute commute to Grand Central Terminal. Now, after months of renting, they are ready to buy their first home. The couple's price range is in the neighborhood of $300,000, Mr. Nelson said.
 
A Distinctly Different Mood
 But like many other first-time buyers, Mr. Nelson, who is 44, and Ms. Higgins, 36, are gingerly approaching a real estate market that has fluctuated wildly in the last several years and is showing the first signs of stability since the late 1980's.
As previously reluctant sellers put their homes on the market and buyers obtain the lowest interest rates in 18 years, brokers countywide are reporting brisk sales activity. This, they say, is some of the best news the industry has had since the recession began.
But even with signs that the real estate market is heading for a recovery, the mood is distinctly different from what it was in the 1980's. It is more sober, brokers say, and there is a marked change in attitude on the part of both buyers and sellers.
"Buyers are shopping smarter this time around," said Louis J. Calcerano, a salesman at Janet Nold Realty in Irvington. "They are more cautious now. Everything was so wild in the 80's." As Mr. Nelson described it: "We're not rushing into anything. We want something with charm and character but also a house with a modern kitchen and modern bathrooms -- something with a good sense of design, something that is priced well and something that is going to be right for a long time."
Buying a house "is a big commitment of money," he said. "One never knows with the job market what the future will bring. We're taking a 90's approach -- more conservative."
Mr. Nelson and Ms. Higgins are typical of the customers many realtors are seeing in their offices. At the Westchester County Board of Realtors, a trade association in White Plains, P. Gilbert Mercurio, the executive vice president, reports a high proportion of first-time buyers who are looking for one-family houses in the $250,000 to $325,000 range.
 
Potential Buyers at Exposition
 At a trade association exposition in the Westchester County Center in White Plains in March, Mr. Mercurio said that many of the estimated 6,000 who attended were first-time buyers -- "couples, some with strollers, who had come out from New York City."
Sellers, also cautious and trying to understand the dynamics of the 1990's real-estate market, are at last adopting what realtors call "proper price strategies."
At Weichert Realtors in Croton-on-Hudson, the sales manager, Renee Goldman, said: "This is already 1992. People aren't thinking about the peak anymore. They have come to terms with the changes, and they are just glad things are moving again."
It has taken sellers about four years to adjust, Mr. Mercurio said, "but they have finally made their peace with the lower prices."
That, however, does not appear to be the case in some areas. At Cleveland E. Van Wert Inc., a realty concern in Scarsdale, a saleswoman, Norma Roberts, said homeowners with more expensive properties still cling to their asking prices.
"They really believe values never sink in Scarsdale," Mrs. Roberts said. "And in some sense that's true, especially at the upper end."
 
Three High-Value Areas
 Not only in Scarsdale but also in Bronxville and Irvington, properties have held their values for the most part, said Nancy L. Chen, an independent appraiser working throughout the county.
In the majority of areas in the county, however, sellers just a year ago were pricing their homes 10 to 15 percent above what the market would support, realtors reported. And now they are pricing the houses, on average, only 5 to 7 percent above what they eventually will sell for.
"What we are seeing," Mr. Mercurio said, "is that there is a deeper appreciation that even with the slippage in the market in the last few years, anyone who held on to their properties for eight or nine years is still realizing an enormous gain."
"There comes a point," he said, "when you take the profit that was fairly realized and don't get greedy."
But greed, Janet Nold, the owner of Janet Nold Realty, is not the sole reason some sellers refuse to scale down their expectations.
 
Some Sellers Are in a Bind
 For example, on the surface it may appear that someone who bought a home 30 years ago for $20,000 is making a substantial profit by selling that house now for $350,000. But in reality, Mrs. Nold said, the owners may have taken out additional loans on the house, when it was worth more, to send their children to college or to start a business.
"Both that kind of seller and the one who purchased a home during the boom period of the 1980's are in a bind," she said. "It would be very difficult for them to come down in price."
For the first quarter of this year, the median sale price of a single-family house in Westchester was $270,000, which means that half of the houses sold for more than that amount and half sold for less. The first-quarter figure of $270,000 was $5,000 higher than the median for the first quarter of 1991.
A peak was hit in the second quarter of 1988, when the median price of a single-family home in the county reached the $320,000 mark.
 
Some Gains in the First Quarter
 There were 903 completed residential real estate transactions in the first quarter of this year, with a total dollar volume of $256.9 million, according to figures released by the Westchester Multiple Listing Service. The number of closings was 22 percent higher than in the same period a year ago, and the dollar volume was 28 percent more.
When seasonally adjusted, however, the first quarter of 1992 reflected a yearly rate of about 4,840 sales, which is 3 percent below 1991's sales and 1 percent below the annual average of 4,887 sales for the last four-year period. The first quarter of 1991 was one of the lowest quarters since the mid-1980's. Total sales in 1991 were 4,988.
Selling time in the county, from the date of listing to the date of closing, averaged 199 days during the first quarter of 1992, compared with 180 days two years ago and 160 days in the mid-1980's.
"There's no fast action," Mr. Mercurio said. "And it doesn't mean sellers are taking a beating. It's just taking time."
Westchester, according to figures from the National Association of Realtors, remains one of the most expensive areas in the country, with only Honolulu, where the median price of a single-family home for the first quarter of this year was $342,000, being more costly. San Francisco was less costly, recording a median price of $243,900. The median price for the New York City area was $169,300 for the first quarter of the year.
 
Co-ops Are 'Down to a Trickle'
 If realtors are cautiously optimistic that this time the market is truly on a track toward recovery, without hitting the peaks and valleys that characterized the late 1980's and the first two years of the 1990's, they are less confident about the market for cooperatives, which appears mired in a slump, Mr. Mercurio said.
Sales of co-ops, Mr. Mercurio said, are "down to a trickle," and the median price is $82,000.
But in a county that has had a lack of affordable housing, co-ops may provide lower-income buyers with "a wonderful opportunity," he said.
Sales have been hurt, in part, by policies set by the cooperative boards, which often prohibit owners from renting their units. This is seen as restricting one's ability to move on to something else.
With the exception of the co-op market, realtors are seeing slow, steady growth.
"It is not going to come back in one fell swoop," said Peter J. Riolo Jr., president of the realty company here that bears his name. "We are not seeing a quick fix, which is good. Growth appears to be heading in a healthy and slow and deliberate direction, and frankly, I think that is what we all prefer."

HEADLINE: Name That Decade

BYLINE: By DAPHNE MERKIN

 BODY:
A DECADE is a decade is a media construction.
Just try getting into the Park Avenue Cafe to discuss the earnest, penitential 90's with a friend and you'll see what I mean. A phone call to the restaurant to book a table produced the same results on three separate occasions in the last two weeks: nothing available until 9:30. So much for everyone sitting at home, munching on terra chips and watching the latest video release. 
 Everywhere you look -- from Charivari's fey new ad campaign knocking the 90's credos of "nesting" and "basics" along with such non-cutting-edge fashion items as ripped jeans and T-shirts, to the booming business in eating out -- there are indisputable signs that some of the superficial, high-spending 80's is creeping back into the reflective, austere 90's. Not quite two years into the new decade, it seems some of us not only have tired of everything it's supposed to be about but are already pining for the styles and influences left behind.
What's in a decade, anyway? And how is it that this arbitrary and slim crosscutting of time, a mere 10 years, has grown and flourished to the point that we all walk around in a self-conscious haze about what a new decade represents even before the previous one has tolled its last?
This imposed sense of short-lived generational identity makes for a curious kind of awareness, and it prompts one to wonder if other periods were similarly burdened by predictive assessment. Did people in the Lost Generation, for instance, walk around thinking of themselves as the Lost Generation? Did people coming of age in the 30's realize they were meant to be Radical? And what if you were saddled with an obstreperous nature but doomed by dint of your birthdate to grow up in the pliant 50's?
The writer Tom Wolfe, himself no mean gauger of shifts in the Zeitgeist, and one of the few culture-watchers whose coinages, including the "Me Decade," have stuck, says there's nothing new about the effort to label epochs. When pressed for examples before this century, he pointed to the "Gay 90's" (1890's, that is), to the term "fin de siecle" and to "the Mauve Decade" (which he's read about in the work of one Thomas Beard but is not sure what span of years this refers to). Mr. Wolfe went on to ponder the impure science of which he is a master: "What does it mean to capture a decade? It means you're hitting on something that resonates with other people's impressions."
Lest one think that coming up with catchy monikers is as easy as this description would make it sound, keep in mind that it helps to take a long hard look before you leap into phraseology: "I waited until 1976," Mr. Wolfe admitted, "before I opened my big mouth about the 70's. Hindsight is easier."
Calling a decade before it happens, however, is another matter. For clues as to how the New Earnestness, or whichever hastily concocted media definition of the 90's you prefer, has lost its sheen so quickly, one has to look to the contemporary practice of forecasting, with its reliance on buzzwords (like "downscaling") and tags ("baby boomers").
Faith Popcorn, chairwoman of Brain Reserve, a trend-research firm in New York, is retained by Fortune 500 companies for her and her staff's ability to spot trends. "We predicted 'cocooning' in 1981," she crowed. "It's already in its second decade of use." When I suggested that I saw evidence that "cocooning" might not be holding quite the sway over the 90's that it was supposed to, she blithely predicted that even more mole-like activity was in the wings. "Cocooning will become burrowing," she said with great assurance. "People will stay at home and hang out in 'virtual reality' rooms for good." (For those who have been too busy making dinner reservations to keep up, "virtual reality" is shorthand for ordering in the world.)
Of course, the complex welter of impulses that go into the making of subtle shifts in the social landscape don't really lend themselves to a marketing executive's demographic approach. There's fame and fortune to be had in naming fads for a living, but one can't help thinking the people who do it are perched at a safe distance from reality, like the golden bird in W. B. Yeats's "Sailing to Byzantium" who sits on a golden bough and sings "of what is past, or passing or to come."
If you believed the trendmeisters' version of it then, this was what was prognosticated for the American psyche and wallet as we moved out of the 80's and into the 90's: Glazed and repelled by the wanton spending of the wild capitalists, with the economy roiling from too much schlag and not enough basic nutrients, we were all supposed to retreat behind our white picket fences, there to bring up our children on Gap clothes and Recycling 101, sipping Clearly Canadian and munching on newly reclaimed home-style values.
The 90's, in other words, were to be the 60's but without the hallucinogens and with more character built in. Goodbye, Bright Lights, Big City. Hello, Fresh Air, Snug Houses.
For a while, at least in the universe that is governed by the laws of consumerism, it seemed true. The merchandising atmosphere that had prompted one advertising company's house publication to state in 1985 that "what has increased so dramatically in recent years is not household income, but the number of households with a taste for lavish living" was banished along with Wall Street's Bad Boys. Glamour and sophistication (Lacroix's poufs and top-of-the-line Mercedeses) were ushered out as the hallmarks of the good life; low-key sincerity (the fresh-faced parents and tot gathered round the tub in this year's Liz Claiborne ads, shot in understated black and white) was ushered in.
The trouble with this smoothly executed about-face is that what worked so well for the mercantile imperative -- for Giorgio Armani, say, who introduced his soft-shouldered "schlep" suit just in time for the humbled posture of the new decade -- worked less well for real humans, whose morals and outer garb don't so easily mix and match. "Trends like casual dressing and nesting," said Richard Kirshenbaum, 31, the creative director of the New York agency that has handled the Charivari account for the last four and a half years, "take the wind out of people who want to have a good time. You're not a terrible person if you want to buy a Yohji Yamamoto blazer."
Kirshenbaum & Bond's much-discussed farewell-to-the-90's ad campaign, with its "wake us when it's over" tag line, was generated by a round-table discussion with Jon and Barbara Weiser, who run Charivari. "There was a shared sense," he said, "that people in general seemed to be depressed and understated, that they wanted the 90's to be over and were waiting for the next thing."
What of the person who yearns to paint the town red in an age of staying home and curling up with a good book?
It is tempting to construe decade-bucking as no more than a failure to fit in with the clothes of the times, as though life itself comes down to a War of the Labels, a matter of siding with expensive foreign designs and against moderate native shapes. And there may be something in the very nature of trying to codify tiny segments of history -- with the instant exhaustion of events and responses that inevitably goes with it -- that runs counter to making serious claims upon our attention.
"What we do when we 'decadize,' " said Marshall Blonsky, who teaches semiotics at the New School, "is to substitute nostalgia for history. And nostalgia means that what is produced is an idealized version of what was. What you've done is to open up a new market -- for Golden Oldies, or 60's tie-dyed clothing or whatever. You've commodified the decade. It's all part of the incessant fashion game in the States. Time itself becomes a matter of fashion."
Still, underneath the carping about clothes and cars lie deeper anxieties. These include the increased perception, with each succeeding decade, of ourselves as the objects of a proliferating and bewildering taxonomy, as cogs in the vast hype machine that has come to dominate the late-20th-century landscape.
"Decadology," said the writer Barbara Probst Solomon, "ought to be outlawed. When I got through college I was told I was a member of the Silent Generation, yet all my friends were very political. It was a press-agent's gimmick then and it's one now."
A small but crucial aspect of the emerging collective resistance to the quick-change personifications that are thrust upon us faster than you can say thirtysomething is, simply, this: Upbeat, expansive versions of our forthcoming lives are inherently more appealing than dour, contracted ones.
The yen for glitz is undoubtedly not one of the more mature human characteristics, and yet it continues to thrive, if only because life is not, bottom line, a glamorous proposition. What seems unlikely is that such an appetite, irresponsible or unprofound as it may be, can be denounced as unfashionable. Or that recasting the daily round of one's life as glamorous, which is what all the 90's-speak of hearth and home has tried to do, will fool anyone for long. The uninhibited spirit of ostentation that prevailed while the bronco bankers were in the horse's seat may well have gone undercover, but at the end of a hard-working day people still want to have fun. Drew Nierporent, proprietor of New York's Montrachet and Tribeca Grill, noted: "As long as there are baby sitters, there'll be eating out."
The question, finally, to be posed about the passing of the climate of excess is whether the cold shower of the economic recession has genuinely spilled over into other areas; that is, whether Americans have rethought their values so much as cut back on them.
Tom Wolfe, while conceding that "there's been a lot of ethical and moral questioning on all sides," has his doubts as to whether there have been any cataclysmic shocks to the underlying acquisitive ideology. "I don't see any great movement," he said, "that's going to change anything. Nobody wants to admit that all that went wrong in the 90's is that the money stopped flowing. It's much easier and more satisfying to think in cosmic terms, that God had something to do with it."
The Marxist critic Frederic Jameson has suggested that consumer society, by transforming American experience into a pretext for glossy images, has left us "bereft of all historicity." In "Postmodernism" he writes, "We seem increasingly incapable of fashioning representations of our own current experience." Where that leaves us is in an uneasy limbo, clutching after the future even as it is being wheeled offstage, and searching among the discarded props of the recent past for something that corresponds to our memories of it. "Who was Hitler anyway?" Jameson asks, with deadly irony. "Who was Kennedy? Who, finally, was Nixon?"
A decade is a decade is a media construction. When I asked William Phillips, founding editor of Partisan Review and a man who has observed many an intellectual fad come and go, to characterize the decades as he remembered, he had no trouble except when it came to the 40's. What happened to the 40's, stuck between the "radical" 30's and the "quietist" 50's? Mr. Phillips shrugged his shoulders. "They were the post-30's."
The 40's, of course, were the War Years, also known as the Duration. It appears that when something big is going on -- when a nation has to pull together to fight a common enemy -- the urge to "decadize" (at least in the sense of characterizing spending habits) falls away. If entire decades get lost in the shuffle, others exist only in truncated form: The 60's, Mr. Wolfe said, existed only from '65 to '69. So if you can't find a decade to label, half a decade will do nicely.
Even the wrong pronunciamiento will pass muster, if the right person utters it. With a twinkle in his voice, Mr. Wolfe recounted how he was asked on a TV program sometime in the late 70's to name the 80's. Too vain, by his own account, to resist, Mr. Wolfe announced that it would be known as the Purple Decade. (Given the royal spending that was about to begin, he wasn't far off.) "You can look back at any decade and hope it was mauve," he concluded, somewhat inscrutably.
Pick a color, any color, and wake me when the contest is over. Or perhaps it's time, as we scramble toward the end of the second millennium, to stay wide awake and start thinking in terms of the long haul. Anyone got any suggestions as to what color the next thousand years will be?

PACIFIC RIFT
By Michael Lewis.
128 pp. New York:
W. W. Norton & Company.
$14.95. 
 Each spring, like a variety of mutant cherry blossom, books that provide devastating analyses of Japan seem fated to bloom over the New York literary landscape. Following Michael Crichton's "Rising Sun" and a host of economic exposes, Michael Lewis now gives us "Pacific Rift." At 128 pages it is, mercifully, a short book, though it manages to include more sweeping judgments, definitive statements and blanket assurances than many a 500-pager. Fortunately for the reader, it is nicely written and amusing. Indeed, "With Divining Rod and Grin Through Darkest Tokyo" might have been a more accurate title. I am sad to make this judgment because I much enjoyed Mr. Lewis's earlier books, "Liar's Poker," his best-selling account of the bond market, and his collection of essays, "The Money Culture."
Retaining his chatty style here, Mr. Lewis explains that since "most of what has been written" about the tensions between Japan and the United States has had to do with politics, he will now write about businessmen and their problems -- "real people in the midst of the fray." What he has been reading about the "relationship" I don't know, but I do know from personal experience that by far the greatest portion of the tonnage written has dealt not with politics, but with business or the economy.
The conclusion of Mr. Lewis's book, he attempts to tell us, is: "I'll bet the question in America will no longer be 'How do we open Japan?' Instead it will become 'How can our capitalism beat their capitalism?' " This is hardly an earthshaking revelation. Peter Drucker, Lester Thurow, Chalmers Johnson, Robert Reich and others have been saying much the same thing for many years. About the only people who still believe that Japan's version of the free enterprise system is just like ours are the neoclassical economists who have apparently been advising the White House.
Mr. Lewis chooses two "real people" to report on -- Robert J. Collins, an American who worked in Tokyo for some years selling insurance to the Japanese for the American International Group (A.I.G.), and Shuji Tomikawa, a Japanese who lives in New York and sells American real estate to his fellow countrymen for Mitsui Real Estate. Both seem to be nice fellows, and we are vouchsafed amusing glimpses of their business activities. But it is difficult to perceive what Mr. Lewis is trying to prove with their stories -- other than to reaffirm the obvious fact that Japanese and American ways of doing business are often very different.
On the way, however, the author makes a variety of overstatements and conclusions that hardly seem justified. He maintains, for example, that A.I.G.'s success in Japan could never have been achieved if it had not got a toehold there during the American occupation of the country following World War II. Quite possibly so. But it is inaccurate to generalize from this example that the foreign businessman in Tokyo is doomed because of what Mr. Lewis calls the "Japanese Defense," a combination of cartels, distribution practices, government surveillance and the like.
He quotes the president of A.I.G., Buck Freeman: "We have learned to survive in the Japanese jungle, and it is a jungle." This can be said of almost any business society -- Wall Street, for example -- especially when visitors don't know very much about local practices and overconfidently expect them to be like their own. Japan, a country where cartels are not illegal but merely good business and where Government "guidance" has the force of law, is a very difficult country to do business in -- no doubt about it. But many foreign companies set up shop in Tokyo long after the occupation ended and did quite well by paying close attention to local ground rules.
Part of Japan's business success has come from its executives' ability to adapt. To do so they need no prompting. It is highly debatable -- to put it mildly -- whether "every important American-style change in Japan has been made while staring into the barrel of a gun or under the threat of American trade sanctions."
For the rest, Mr. Lewis is appallingly superficial in some of his comments. History he ignores. To describe the Meiji Restoration, Japan's great self-started 19th-century cultural revolution, as "a coup d'etat politely known as the Meiji Restoration" is laughable. He oversimplifies the beginnings of Japanese industry and the impact of the American occupation on Japan. Modern Japan is handled in a similarly casual way. "Here in Japan, no bankruptcies," he quotes an insurance guild official as saying. In fact, not only do large numbers of middle-sized Japanese companies regularly go into bankruptcy, but in recent years some rather big enterprises have been allowed to bite the dust.
On a more mundane level, to call the small neighborhood around the Roppongi crossroads "the Western quarter of Tokyo" is like describing the Japanese restaurant belt in Manhattan's East 40's as the "Eastern quarter of New York." On a trip to a Tokyo nightclub -- now virtually obligatory in such books -- we are introduced to "Kiko, Miko, Yuko, and a couple of others with equally improbable names." How ethnocentric can you get? And Mr. Lewis's voyage through the Japanese economy is not made easier by his single-minded reliance on the semiconspiratorial view of history advanced by such current revisionist patriarchs as Karel van Wolferen, who is fast becoming a kind of fangs-bared Lafcadio Hearn for modern critics of Japan who don't have the time to read on their own.
There are real difficulties in Japan's dealings with the United States. But not the least of these is American ignorance of Japanese economic and social realities -- not to mention our failure to devise better ways of producing and competing on our own. As an admirer of Michael Lewis's journalism, I only wish he had taken a good bit more time to examine and discuss the real issues.

CHINA
A New History.
By John King Fairbank.
Illustrated. 519 pp. Cambridge, Mass.:
The Belknap Press/
Harvard University Press.
$27.95. 
 SLIGHTLY before the midpoint of John King Fairbank's latest and last book -- the eminent Harvard historian of China died last year at the age of 84 -- appears the only overtly autobiographical passage in the volume. It was in the early 1930's, Fairbank writes in "China: A New History," that he and his wife settled into Beijing life, and three things at once impressed the young newlywed graduate students as unusual. First, there was the extraordinary extent of their privilege as foreign residents; they were treated as members of the ruling-class elite from the first moment in China and were left unbothered by the ubiquitous police. Second, because of the incredible surplus of Chinese manpower the easiest form of transportation around the ancient city was by rickshaw: you lay back against the seats of the two-wheeled vehicle while the "intelligent human horse between the shafts" trotted and sweated his way to your destination. Third, in both city and country, all women of early middle age and over had bound feet, which left them "stumping about awkwardly on their heels as though the front sections of their feet had been amputated."
Why had this last practice in particular, Fairbank muses, been so little studied or discussed by either Chinese or Western scholars? For close to a millennium, hundreds of millions of Chinese women had had the toes of their feet systematically bent under their arches, and the arches themselves strapped, tilted and broken, and then the women had performed the same protracted and agonizing ritual deformation on their own daughters. Why had no one tried to assess the "social and psychic repercussions" of this nightmare practice, reputedly performed for the sensual delectation of men, even though the physiological, esthetic or erotic effects of foot-binding were far from clear?
Perhaps, Fairbank concludes, Chinese scholars had dodged the topic because it would have forced them to confront the whole problem of women's subjugation; and perhaps the Westerners had dodged the topic as well because they were eager to avoid giving offense to Chinese sensitivities. Few scholars "are muckrakers by temperament," notes Fairbank, and since foot-binding was unique to China it was not a convenient topic for comparative sociological study. Furthermore, he observes, there is an "occupational quirk of sinologists, a secondary patriotism or sinophilia that may lead otherwise hard-headed scholars to want to say no evil of the object of their researches."
This last sentence is starred to a footnote on the same page, almost the only time in this entire history that Fairbank uses such a device, and the purpose of the starred note is clearly to deepen the autobiographical reflection further, and to carry it forward in time into another kind of dangerous psychic terrain. "For an outstanding example of sentimental sinophilia," Fairbank adds, "see my statement in Foreign Affairs, October 1972, that in a certain context the Maoist revolution was 'the best thing' that had happened to the Chinese people in many centuries."
In these brief passages we have a distillation of the historical stance that Fairbank adopted in the last years of his long and formidably productive scholarly life -- a stance that sought to present itself as both frank and skeptical, tackling the difficult questions and suggesting directions for new research, while making the author himself disarmingly vulnerable by his admission of past mistakes. Fairbank, this century's foremost promoter of Chinese studies, chose to bow out with a show of modesty.
I say show of modesty not with any intention to belittle this extraordinary man, but rather to underscore the incredible ambitiousness of his final work. "China: A New History" sets out to cover, in 432 pages of text, the entire span of China's history from the paleolithic cultures of 400,000 B.C. to the Tiananmen massacre of 1989, and it does so with a brisk and sprightly air but also with an awesomely thorough overview of the current scholarly work of scores of historians. The book is indeed a kind of reprise not only of Fairbank's life as a reader and teacher, but also of his long years as editor or co-editor of the many volumes of the monumental "Cambridge History of China," Volume 15 of which, on the People's Republic and Taiwan between 1966 and 1982, was published last year. Perhaps most surprisingly, for those who have followed Fairbank's extraordinary range of studies in the fields of Chinese-United States foreign policy, institutional history and missionary history, "China: A New History" is dedicated in large part to social history, to the infrastructures and daily life of the Chinese, and to the elusive world of "civil society" that obviously existed and flourished at many levels under the watchful eyes of the purportedly omnipresent autocratic state.
Despite Fairbank's attention to social movements in this volume, his intellectual energy seems still to be most concentrated on the problems of state power and dissonance that led -- among other things -- to those three aspects of exploitive hierarchy that he highlighted in the book's autobiographical musings. In one passage, arresting to the historian at once for its concision and for the vastness of the ideas tackled, Fairbank reflects on how a kind of unifying theory does seem to emerge from his lifetime's reading and research on China's long history, a theory that makes sense because it incorporates the rhythms of China's periods of fragmentation and conquest by others along with its own enduring institutional forms. In Fairbank's words:
"The hypothesis may be stated as follows: (1) that early China created a politicized state organized for purposes of central control both by bureaucratic methods of philosophic persuasion and by the imperial autocrat's use of violence; (2) that non-Chinese invaders from Inner Asia became integral participants in the Chinese polity by their military prowess and administrative skill; and (3) that the resulting Sino-nomadic imperial power continued to maintain the primacy of central political control over the subordinated processes of economic growth and cultural diversification."
Elsewhere in the volume, Fairbank produces a rather different formulation that he felt contrasted China succinctly with the main lines of Western development. Where the main line of Western national "style" had been "industrial-military-entrepreneurial," that in China had been "agrarian-nomadic-bureaucratic." In many ways, as Fairbank's chapters on modern China show, both Chiang Kai-shek and Mao Zedong were caught in this cycle of values. Fairbank is distinctly unsympathetic to both these central leaders of 20th-century China, consistently with his earlier views in the case of Chiang, and perhaps seeking to bury the ghost of those 1972 "sentimental" deviations in the case of Mao.
Though the economic, educational and industrial reforms of Chiang's Kuomintang years are discussed fairly and thoroughly, Chiang himself emerges as a "vigorous Dr. Jekyll" who "metamorphosed" into a "sordid Mr. Hyde," and lost the civil war of 1946-49 through "stupidity" and "incompetence." Similarly, though Communist attempts at national and rural reconstruction get their due, Fairbank writes that Mao's basic "organizational principle" was that of any traditional Chinese "bandit" who used "force and guile . . . to curry favor with the local people," before he emerged at last as an "updated emperor" whose final acts were to lead his people "up a mountain and into a volcano."
The only man to get an equally bad press is the leader of the massive mid-19th-century Taiping Rebellion, Hong Xiuquan, whose "bizarre and irrational" theocracy prompts Fairbank to search for parallels that range from Napoleon to Hitler. The invoking of such parallels is a device that Fairbank enjoys, and like his invocation of echoes from China's past it can be effective and arresting. Occasionally it illuminates the instant with a zany humor similar to that which did indeed bubble just beneath Fairbank's own often formidable public persona. One of my favorites is Fairbank's aside that the closest equivalent he can think of to Mao's massively publicized swim across the Yangtze River in 1966 would be "the news that Queen Elizabeth II had swum the Channel."
SUCH asides may not be good history, but they are good-humored and make a point. On other occasions, the aside can trivialize the moment. Thus to summarize the archeological finds of Stone Age Chinese skeletons with smashed-in skulls as showing that "Peking Man was a small-time cannibal or at least a head-hunter who savored brains" strikes me as a little tacky; to equate Han dynasty neo-Confucian imperial rituals with White House "foto-ops and sound-bites" is erratic; and to call the terrible famine that followed the Great Leap Forward "first-class" is truly odd.
Such ruminations aside, this book is an admirable achievement. And even if one cannot accept the idea that this history is entirely new, Fairbank has filled the analytic narrative with intelligent ideas and original contributions: on the long-term effect of the absence of early maritime trade in China, on frontier appeasement policies, on the inherent problems of translation of foreign texts into Chinese characters, on Confucian attitudes to the military, on the development of popular religion, on sweated labor, on the failures of democratic experimentation and the other quests of China's new elite of "Sino-liberals," on the politics of repression and the role of sycophancy. Fairbank dominated the field of China studies in the West for 50 years. In this volume, we see that even on the edge of death his hand had not lost its cunning.

HEADLINE: New York's Carriage Drivers Are Getting an Unfair Rap

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Everyday when I go to work, driving my horse-drawn carriage, I meet people with hate-filled faces who scream at me how cruel I am to my horse. They have probably never brushed a horse in their lifetime, and dare to tell me how to work with it.
I brush my horse every day, assure myself that it has no sore, give it a shower after every hot summer day, massage its legs and shoulders with alcohol, feed it, water it, call the vet if it's sick, give it a day off if it's tired. The horse is my partner not only in my economical subsistence but also emotional: it is a friend. 
 I pick up fliers issued by "animal rights activists" that tell the people of New York City how cruel and irresponsible the carriage drivers are toward their animals.
For instance, one stated that during the winter the stables were not heated, and that during the summer they had no air conditioning. Well, during the cold months, horses grow thick fur coats. If the stable were heated, the horses would lose their coats and then get pneumonia from working outside.
On the other hand, if the stables had air conditioning during the hot season, the horses would grow fur coats and then suffocate under the summer heat. Such blatant ignorance is constantly fed to people of good will who care about animals. It gives these people the illusion that the horse and carriage industry is insensitive and purely exploitative of the animals.
I drove a horse once that had been sent to the country to recover from a sore. I took it out in the streets for the first time after three weeks' convalescence. This horse was so happy! It was trotting in the streets, tail up, neighing to the other horses. Pulling a carriage is good exercise for them. It keeps them healthy and happy.
I agree with certain laws to protect them, such as those mandating only one shift or the temperature under which they can work. But other laws are just completely ridiculous and prevent carriage drivers from making a decent living.
For instance, the hours limiting the day shift are too short. The hours from 4 to 7 P.M. are hours when people are finishing their day of work and are willing to take a ride. Those hours are crucial to our business and should be given back to us.
The city should also give us back the streets at night, as soon as the rush hour is over, and during the weekends when the traffic is not as heavy. This would make the business more prosperous and would diminish the competition among us (we are all crowded in one area, and with the recession, times are very hard).

HEADLINE: The Road To Rio -- Setting an Agenda for the Earth;
Difficult Algebra for China: Coal = Growth = Pollution

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, May 24

 BODY:
China's economic revolution may be dotting the countryside with new factories and electricity plants, but it may also be having an unintended effect: its contribution to global warming may be rising more quickly than that of any other major country.
Most countries have become increasingly aware that warming of the earth could cause climate changes and rising sea levels. Even the United States, which many scientists say contributes more to the greenhouse effect than any other country, is considering curbs on gases thought to cause global warming.
 
The Centrality of Coal
 But here there is little awareness of the problem. China burns increasing amounts of coal and is expected to surpass the United States and the former Soviet Union to become the single greatest contributor of greenhouse gases in coming decades. 
 "China will probably become the No. 2 emitter within the next 10 years," said Christopher Flavin, a climate specialist at the Worldwatch Institute, an environmental research group in Washington, D.C. "The rate of growth in China's carbon dioxide emissions is far, far greater than any major emitter anywhere in the world."
Burning coal produces carbon dioxide, the most significant greenhouse gas, but coal is China's main source of energy and thus an essential element of its strategy to catch up with the industrial world.
Next month at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, world leaders will try to persuade countries, particularly developing nations like China, to use less coal and to spend more on the environment.
But there is no doubt that China will continue to rely on coal well into the next century, so the crucial question environmentalists are asking is, Will China be willing to curb the country's release of threatening gases, even at the possible cost of economic growth?
For now, the answer is no.
"China must develop, and its people must enjoy a better life, but we can't make it without energy," said Bai Xianhong, a senior official at the State Science and Technology Commission, which oversees environmental work. "You can't say that for the sake of lowering carbon dioxide emissions, China shouldn't burn coal anymore. This is impossible. In winter, people wouldn't be able to keep warm. They'd have no electricity or lighting."
In wintertime, plumes of black smoke rise from millions of homes that burn coal for warmth. In major cities, where few use gas heating, a typical family may burn nearly half a ton of coal during winter. Three-quarters of China's energy comes from coal, and power generators and industrial boilers pump hundreds of thousands of tons of carbon dioxide into the air each day.
"Every morning a dense black smoke streams out of the smokestack right behind our house," said a young worker who lives in Beijing. "Who's thinking of global warming, when we can barely even breathe?"
Each year, China mines more than a billion metric tons of coal, more than any other country in the world. By the end of this century, the country plans to produce 1.4 billion tons each year, almost all of which it will burn at home, and by 2020, it could mine 2 billion tons a year, half the world's production.
Chinese leaders say they are well aware of the pollution that unrestrained coal-burning can cause, aside from the risks of global warming. But the Government has made its position clear: It will not sacrifice development for the environment.
 
'Above All, Development'
 "You can't even talk about economic sacrifice," said Jing Wenyong, director of the Environmental Engineering Institute at Qinghua University. "Above all, we must have economic development."
At last count, in 1989, China produced 9.1 percent of the gases that contribute to global warming, ranking third in the world, according to World Resources Institute, a nonprofit research group in Washington, D.C. The United States produced the largest amount, 17.8 percent; the Soviet Union followed, with 13.6 percent.
On a per-capita basis, China does not even rank in the top 50 countries, the institute says; each American released nine times as much greenhouse gas as each Chinese.
But if China's gross domestic product grows 8.5 percent a year for the next three decades -- unlikely but not impossible, since China's economy grew by 9.7 percent a year in the 1980's -- then by 2025, the amount of carbon dioxide released could be three times the amount released by the United States, according to estimates by the Stockholm Environment Institute.
 
Growing More, Burning Less
 Scientists both here and abroad say China must improve the efficiency of its steel mills, its factories and all energy consumption if it wants to continue growing while limiting its contribution to global warming. Energy use by China's industry is among the least efficient in the world, said William U. Chandler, senior scientist at Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratories, an environmental management and consulting group in Richland, Wash.
"The United States is the greatest concern because it is the largest emitter now," Mr. Chandler said in a telephone interview. "But the lines will cross in the future in terms of their emissions versus ours, and they will become the largest emitter. If they do that without becoming energy efficient, they will suffer the wrath of the rest of the world the way the United States does now."
While United States environmentalists take an active role in proposing measures to curb global warming, many critics say the United States as a nation has left the largest trail of pollution and done little to clean up after itself. Chinese specialists argue that it is unfair to impose constraints on China when Western countries have been polluting the atmosphere for more than a century and China has only recently become a significant offender.
"It's not good enough to calculate total emissions of a year, but for the last 200 years," said Wang Mingxing, an atmospheric physicist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. "If you calculate the emissions for 200 years, China's concentration is very small."
Critics of this view argue that global warming and its causes have become a concern only in recent years.
To be sure, China is somewhat sensitive to environmental issues and natural resources constraints. Some experts say that China is among the most environmentally enlightened of the developing countries, and Beijing is collaborating with Western advisers to develop strategies to protect its soil, water and air.
In its current five-year plan, to 1995, China sharply raised spending on the environment, but the amount still remains about nine-tenths of 1 percent of gross national product. Environmental spending in the United States runs 1 percent to 2 percent of G.N.P.
China only recently acknowledged that on balance it would be hurt by global warming. It says that if the overall temperature were to rise one to two degrees, some colder agricultural areas would benefit because the extra heat and sunshine would extend the growing season. But warming could dry up crops more easily and cause droughts and hot winds in many other areas, leading scientists to say that China could lose 5 percent of its agricultural production.
A warmer climate would also shrink water supplies. And a rise in sea levels could seriously damage coastal areas, the backbone of the national economy; Shanghai, the nation's biggest city, could be flooded. On parts of the Tibetan plateau in northwestern China, highways, railways and housing could tumble as the permafrost they are built on melted.
Partly because of these concerns, China has set aside about $15 million for research on global warming. The Government also sees the issue as a way to broaden its role in the world, and so it has held international conferences on the environment and a special international council to examine environmental issues.
"China is playing both sides of the sword," said a Western environmental specialist. "The Ministry of Foreign Affairs wants to reassert its role in the developing world. It also knows it can endear itself to the developed countries by showing it is doing a lot on the environment."
China has also called upon Western countries to finance environmental improvements in developing countries, including China.
While China has recently run articles and television specials on the environment in preparation for the Earth Summit, awareness of environmental problems in general is much lower than in the West.
When "green" movements in the West were beginning to blossom in the 1970's and 80's, most of China had not even seen plastic. Now, in offices, conference rooms and meeting halls across China, slogans focus on developing the economy as quickly as possible.
"Most people here simply don't care about the environment, especially in the township and village enterprises," said a Chinese reporter who used to cover the environment. "They don't realize it will affect their future."

HEADLINE: Russian Says Communists Still Resist Reforms

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LISBON, May 24

 BODY:
Russia's Foreign Minister warned today at an international conference on aid to the former Soviet republics that a determined Communist resistance movement was threatening economic reforms.
In remarks that appeared to be aimed in part at the other republics, the Foreign Minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev, said hard-line Communists bent on revenge often allied themselves with nationalist movements to obscure their true goals. 
 "The resistance to reform makes even more important the political solidarity we see here at this conference," Mr. Kozyrev said. Seated around him at the news conference were ministers or high-ranking officials of other new nations, including Ukraine, which is locked in a tense dispute with Russia over the future of the Crimea.
Officials at the meeting, which was organized by the European Community to follow up on a conference convened by the United States in January, heard reports on immediate food, medical, energy and other needs of the nations that emerged from the breakup of the Soviet Union in December.
 
October Session Planned
 Another session of the aid conference, which was attended this time by more than 60 nations and international organizations, is tentatively planned for October in Japan.
At the news conference, Mr. Kozyrev appeared to be responding to charges that Russia's decision to ban the Communist Party of the former Soviet Union was a violation of political rights, a criticism heard occasionally in the West. The ban is to be tested next week in a constitutional court in Moscow, the Foreign Minister said.
He said that while people were free to believe in Communism or join other parties espousing it, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was an undemocratic and "illegal" organization.
The United States proposed several projects at the weekend aid meeting, including technical assistance to improve safety at 37 nuclear plants in the former Soviet republics and to convert military industries to civilian use.
The initial American contribution will be a $25 million expansion of advisory work already being provided by the Energy Department and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The centerpiece of the expanded program will be two regional centers, in Russia and Ukraine, for training on the principles and methods of nuclear safety management.
Another Administration grant of $20 million will be used to help convert military industries to civilian production. The money will pay for the assignment of resident American advisers in Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan. Trade and investment centers will also be established, backed by promises of low-cost loans to small businesses.
 
Surveys by I.M.F.
 Today Mr. Baker said that the international aid and economic support package pledged to the new nations had already had tangible results. He said that 103,000 tons of food and millions of dollars in medical aid had been delivered and that half a million children had been vaccinated in a joint project by the World Health Organization and Unicef, which also surveyed the medical needs of the region.
Michel Camdessus, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said that his organization had completed comprehensive surveys of the economies of the new nations and that policy and technical assistance was already in place. The I.M.F. and World Bank accepted most of the former Soviet republics as members in April.

HEADLINE: Baker Puts Pressure on Europeans For U.N. Penalties Against Serbs

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LISBON, May 24

 BODY:
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d called today for United Nations sanctions against the Serbian nationalist Government of Yugoslavia, using his toughest language yet in criticizing European nations for not trying to stop the fighting or punish Belgrade.
"Anyone who is looking for reasons not to act, or arguing somehow that action in the face of this kind of nightmare is not warranted at this time, I think in the view of all of us in the civilized world is on the wrong wavelength," Mr. Baker said. 
 His remarks appeared to be directed at some European countries, especially France and Greece, that seem to be holding up any European consensus decision on sanctions against Serbia in the civil war engulfing Yugoslavia. Mr. Baker's actions also were the latest steps by Washington to try to take the initiative after a period of apparent inaction as the Yugoslav and Bosnian crises became worse.
The Security Council is likely to approve mandatory, step-by-step sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro this week, including a ban on civilian air links and then an oil embargo, according to diplomats and United Nations officials. [Page 6.]
The statements and discussions at the Lisbon meeting, which had been called to discuss aid to the former Soviet republics, revealed the different approaches of the major countries concerned with security of Europe in the post-cold-war world. The approaches appear to be diverging because of a complex mix of domestic and international policy goals, traditional attitudes toward the Serbs or Croats and new fears about the precedents that could be set by intervention.
 
Warning From German
 Joao de Deus Pinheiro, Portugal's Foreign Minister and current president of the European Council of Ministers, said it was a European principle to invoke sanctions "gradually." A meeting on Tuesday in Brussels of European experts to consider sanctions against Serbia would discuss only the "possible identification of sanctions," he said.
But Germany's Foreign Minister, Klaus Kinkel, warned members of the European Community that "people have the impression we are groping in the dark while the killing is going on in Yugoslavia."
Mr. Baker raised the specter of the Persian Gulf war, saying discussions had been opened at the United Nations on the possibility of invoking Chapter 7 of the United Nations Charter, which allows collective action, including economic sanctions and military intervention, against a renegade nation.
Referring at a news conference to action against the Serbian Government, Mr. Baker said: "I can't predict for you when that might or might not be possible. But I can predict for you that we intend to continue those discussions, and push them as forcefully as we know how because of what's taken place in Bosnia and Herzegovina."
Drawing a parallel to the campaign that led to the imposition of sanctions and finally a war against Iraq in 1990-1991, he said he did not rule out support of an international force for Yugoslavia, but repeated that all other methods should be tried first.
 
Allusion to the Nazis
 He also alluded to Nazi Germany in his remarks, which were made as he sat at the same table with Mr. Kinkel. "The ethnic purification of certain portions of Bosnia and Herzegovina is all too reminiscent of something that we sat back and witnessed a number of years ago," Mr. Baker said.
He said he was encouraged to hear that European Community experts would meet to discuss sanctions on Tuesday in Brussels at the European Community headquarters. But he said he would be "even more encouraged if, coming out the meeting on Tuesday, there were a willingness on the part of our European colleagues to act."
After attending the meetings here today, the Russian Foreign Minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev, flew off to Yugoslavia tonight on a personal mission to try to negotiate the reopening of the airport at Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina. He also said it would be a grave mistake to withdraw United Nations peacekeepers from the former Yugoslav republics.
The setting for the exchanges was an international meeting on aid to the former Soviet republics. But in the corridors and at the news conferences, the subject being discussed was the assault on Bosnia and Herzegovina and how Europe and its North Atlantic partners were performing in their new task of insuring security in the post-cold-war era.
 
Speculation on Motives
 Mr. Baker's tough new line on Yugoslavia has been variously interpreted by European and American anaylsts. Some see it as a negative reaction to the French and German decision to create a 35,000-man joint military corps that American officials have feared would be the beginning of a wider European force that could undermine the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
Others say Mr. Baker risked a policy embarrassment if the Bush Administration continued to say it is following the European lead on Yugoslavia if the Europeans are in fact not leading the alliance anywhere near a solution to the Yugoslav crisis.
There are also Europeans who regard the sudden switch to a high-profile policy as an attempt by the United States to reassert a pre-eminent position in the Western alliance. Still others note that President Bush is running for re-election.
The remarks of the outspoken Mr. Kinkel also came under scrutiny today. At a news conference, the German Foreign Minister said that while Europe was grateful for the interest of Mr. Baker in the Yugoslav crisis, "it will be the task of Europe to conquer this problem."
But he challenged his fellow Europeans to take a more realistic view of the problems of Bosnia -- or a view more in line with Germany's traditional support of Croats against Serbs.
"What is happening in Yugoslavia is atrocious," he said. "As I see it, it should be stated clearly who is responsible for this. The Serbians are responsible."
The French, who did not send a minister to today's news conference, have fought shy of this view, as have the Greeks. Both are thought to be stumbling blocks to concerted European action on sanctions.
Mr. Kinkel, on the other hand, backed Mr. Baker's calls for more European action by saying a consideration of sanctions was "indispensable."
The negative effects on Russia of an oil embargo may be part of Moscow's reluctance until now to support tougher action against Belgrade in the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, which failed to suspend Yugoslavia two weeks ago because of Russian obstruction. Russia has just signed a contract to sell or barter $3.5 billion in oil and gas to the Serbs.
Today Mr. Kozyrev supported sanctions as a last resort when speaking to reporters at a separate news conference with Mr. Baker after the two had discussed further weapons cuts and the impending visit of President Boris N. Yeltsin to Washington.

Canada Recalls Envoy
 MONTREAL, May 24 (Reuter) -- Canada recalled its Ambassador from Belgrade today and suspended landing rights for the Yugoslav airline, JAT, to protest continuing violence in Bosina and Herzegovina, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney announced. The Canadian Government also called for an urgent meeting of the United Nations Security Council to impose economic, trade and oil sanctions against the Belgrade Government.

HEADLINE: U.N. May Widen Yugoslav Sanctions

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, May 24

 BODY:
The United Nations Security Council is likely to approve mandatory, step-by-step sanctions on Serbia and Montenegro on Wednesday or Thursday, according to diplomats and United Nations officials.
Diplomats said that the new measure was being drafted by the United States, Britain and France, and that while details were still being worked out, the first step would probably be a call to follow the United States example by cutting civilian air links by banning all flights by JAT, the Yugoslav national airline. 
 A second stage probably would involve an oil embargo, diplomats said, but a general trade ban is likely to be held in reserve as an ultimate step because Security Council members are reluctant to add to ordinary people's privations.
 
Who Speaks for Yugoslavia?
 The Security Council has already forbidden all arms deliveries to the former Yugoslav federation, of which Serbia and Montenegro are the remaining members. The other four, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia, have declared themselves independent.
The United States is also pressing Serbia and Montenegro over membership in the United Nations. Last week, Washington told Serbia and Montenegro, which declared themselves the successor to Yugoslavia, that they must reapply for membership. That would give Washington the chance to veto the application when it comes before the Security Council.
Earlier this month, United Nations Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali irritated European Council members by saying that continued tension and fighting made it impossible for the organization to expand its peacekeeping role in Bosnia and Herzegovina and might even force it to pull out of Croatia as well.
As a result, the Security Council adopted a resolution that reaffirmed its peace plan for Croatia and Slovenia.
The council members are also under growing pressure from Islamic countries, which complain that Serbia has expanded the Christian area of Bosnia and Herzegovina at the expense of its Muslims, which are the largest single group. This weekend Iran, which provides about 15 percent of Serbia's oil, said it would not send supplies until Belgrade stops mistreating the Muslims.
Sanctions would be imposed under the rarely used provisions of Chapter 7 of the United Nations Charter, which were also invoked when the council authorized the war 15 months ago to dislodge Iraq from Kuwait.
Chapter 7 says that if efforts to resolve a dispute peacefully fail, the Security Council may impose mandatory trade and economic sanctions on a country that is threatening international peace and security, and may resort to armed force if that country still refuses to obey the council's orders.
 
Counting Votes
 Russia is reported to be anguishing over the proposed resolution because it does not like moving against a former ally and because Russia swaps oil for farm materials and building supplies from Yugoslavia. But Western diplomats believe Russia will agree in the end because Moscow cannot afford to be seen rescuing President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia.
China, which is Serbia's largest oil supplier, also faces economic losses from an embargo. But diplomats note that China traditionally goes along with any course of action agreed to by the other four permanent Security Council members -- the United States, Britain, France and Russia.
Officials say it is unclear whether the European Community will be willing to impose a complete trade ban. For one thing Greece, a community member, might suffer from any general embargo because much of its trade with the other 11 members goes by road across Serbia and Montenegro.

HEADLINE: Haitians Still Determined to Get Out

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PETIT-GOAVE, Haiti, May 24

 BODY:
Despite new measures aimed at discouraging Haitians from fleeing, this town's beaches, like the bays and coves elsewhere in the south, are teeming with Haitians determined to leave their country and builders readying boats to carry them.
Citing increasingly heavy repression by the military and the suffocating grip of a hemisphere-wide trade embargo imposed on Haiti last October in the hope of reversing a military coup against the elected President, Haitians said that nothing could dissuade them from leaving. 
 Comments like these were offered hours before President Bush authorized the Coast Guard to start picking up all fleeing Haitians at sea and returning them directly to their country.
But those who had heard of measures adopted last week by the United States to limit the exodus, like pulling Coast Guard ships further from the Haitian coast and rescuing only the refugees whose boats were in imminent danger of sinking, expressed some impatience.
"We don't just want to go to Miami, we want to get out of Haiti," said Gerald Labarre, a 28-year-old unemployed painter, who said beatings at the hands of soldiers and policemen had already twice driven him to set sail from this small town in the hope of reaching another country.
 
'People Beaten and Killed'
 "It doesn't matter where we land," Mr. Labarre said. "Things are not right here. Every day people are being beaten and killed.
Mr. Labarre, whose bruises were still visible around one eye, said his companion from two previous attempts to escape Haiti on a small boat had set out again Saturday. "As for me, I fled once, and they returned me," he said. "I fled a second time and they sent me back. I've got to get out, and as soon as we have enough people for a boat, I'll try again."
Others in this one-street town of dilapidated gingerbread houses and tin-roofed shacks 40 miles southwest of the capital cited the crushing weight of the embargo as their principal reason for fleeing.
Unlike people in the drought-stricken northwest, no one starves here along Haiti's verdant southern peninsula. But for weeks now residents say they have not had enough to eat regularly. And many complain that with the economy virtually shut down by the embargo, they no longer have any work.
"All we can do is sit around and wait for change or leave," said Pauline Jean-Baptiste, one of a handful of women who stopped to talk with a visitor on the shores of a small cove where four boats were being readied for the journey toward the United States. Asked how many of them hoped to get aboard the boats, the women shouted in unison, "We all do!"
Like others, Miss Jean-Baptiste said the measures taken by the United States, including the decision on Thursday to stop only the most unseaworthy boats leaving Haiti, would have no effect on her calculations. For these people, the only driving concern is how to get out.
Despite the vigilance of the Coast Guard, which has picked up more than 30,000 Haitians at sea since October and returned most of them to their country, Haitian builders were busily completing dozens of boats, both large and small, for yet more risky voyages in bay after bay along this coast.
People who have made repeated efforts to reach the United States only to be returned said that so many boats were becoming available that the price of the trip had declined. At the start of the Haitian refugee crisis last fall, prospective passengers said they were being asked as much as $500 a seat , a huge amount of money in the hemisphere's poorest country.
 
Fare Now Around $100
 Interviews with travelers today suggested that the common fare is now hovering between $100 and $150.
"There are literally hundreds of boats out there all over the country now just waiting to be launched," a diplomat who has access to reconnaissance information said. "We have spotted one on La Gonave that is being called Noah's Ark. Its hold is as least 40 feet deep. And it appears to be as long as the village where it is being built."
La Gonave is a Haitian island off of the main body of Hispaniola that has long been a staging point for boat trips toward the United States.
In one cove after another, and in parishes and on street corners, Haitians openly shared their motivations -- typically a mixture of crushing hardship and terror -- for wanting desperately to leave.
 
Military Repression Cited
 The Rev. Jean Woudy Louis, a Roman Catholic priest in Petit-Goave, sees brutal military repression of suspected supporters of the overthrown President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, as been the main factor.
"There are roundups all the time, and young men are either forced to go underground or set out to sea to survive," Father Louis said. "Even possessing the picture of Aristide can get you in trouble. Here at our church we have even been threatened by the soldiers."
"We are living in a permanent, unofficial curfew," said Lionel Jocelyn, a 35-year-old unemployed seaman in Petit-Goave who also hoped to find a boat out of the country. "Every night there is a blackout here. The police tell us to stay out of the streets. Meanwhile there are armed bandits who circulate freely committing organized robberies."
Though the signs of repression are multiplying, many other Haitians said it was first and foremost economic misery that had tempted them to leave their homeland.
 
Prices Increase Rapidly
 Coffee and mangos sit stockpiled or spoiling because the embargo has closed off export markets. The price of peasant livestock, another important source of income, has plummeted because of a lack of feed. Meanwhile, prices for transportation, kerosene, cooking oil, milk and many other basic consumer items have increased rapidly, making even a rudimentary living unaffordable for many.
"Prices have gone up so much that people who could normally afford to buy their food are now in trouble," said Virginia Ubick, director of the aid group Care in Haiti, which is feeding more than 300,000 people a day. "They have rice and beans in smaller portions, forget meat, and they just stretch things out as far as they can."
Although admirers of Father Aristide boldly proclaimed their support for the embargo until recently, conditions have deteriorated to the extent that many people are now publicly pleading that it be lifted.
"It's the embargo that has done this to us," said a visibly angry woman in Petit-Goave, pointing to a small child on her lap who she said was hungry. "If you don't lift the embargo soon, we are all going to leave this country. You'll see."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Senate Races;
Women's Issues Draw Attention In Two Contests

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 23

 BODY:
Californians will elect two United States Senators this year, and increasingly it appears that one, possibly both, will be a woman.
There are only two women in the 100-member Senate -- Barbara A. Mikulski, a Maryland Democrat, and Nancy Landon Kassebaum, a Kansas Republican. But if the latest statewide polls here are on the mark as the June 2 Democratic and Republican primaries draw near, Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat and former Mayor of San Francisco, is well on her way to becoming a Senator. 
 At the same time, the polls indicate that Representative Barbara Boxer, a Democrat from Marin County, outside San Francisco, also has a solid shot at becoming a Senator, though her political strength at this point does not equal that of Ms. Feinstein.
The racial violence in Los Angeles has become the most important factor in the two Senate contests. Candidates are arguing bitterly over the causes and cures and pouring in huge amounts of television money in an effort to make their cases and grab the attention of a bored, cynical electorate that knows few of them by name other than Ms. Feinstein.
 
Importance of Women's Issues
 But though racial violence, along with California's faltering economy, are the dominant issues in the two contests, both Ms. Feinstein and Ms. Boxer are being closely watched for indications of where women and women's issues are headed in national politics in the aftermath of several major rape trials, developments in the abortion rights debate and the Senate's widely publicized hearings on sexual harassment.
And because the elections are taking place in California, the nation's most populous state and often its political cutting edge, the importance of women's issues is increased.
Earlier this year, in Democratic senatorial primaries in Illinois and Pennsylvania, little-known female candidates pulled off major upsets. In both of those states, women's issues were major campaign factors, just as they are here.
"Whatever else 1992 is, it's the 'Year of the Woman' when it comes to politics," Ms. Feinstein says repeatedly as she tours the state. "Two percent may be good for fat in milk but it's bad for women in the United States Senate."
 
Hoping to Replace Wilson
 Ms. Feinstein is one of six candidates -- three Democrats and three Republicans -- running in a special election to fill the remaining two years of Pete Wilson's term. Mr. Wilson was elected Governor in 1990 and appointed John Seymour, a fellow Republican, to fill his seat until a special election was held.
Mr. Seymour, a former State Senator, appears likely to win the Republican nomination.
In the other race, for a full term, Ms. Boxer is one of six candidates seeking to replace Alan Cranston, a Democrat who is retiring after four terms. There are also three Democrats and three Republicans in this contest. Like Ms. Feinstein, Ms. Boxer is the only woman in her race.
Though the contest for Mr. Cranston's seat is at first glance the more important, since it involves a full Senate term, it is a political muddle at this point, with the outcome of both primaries in doubt.
 
Clear Leaders in Race
 By contrast, the contest for Mr. Wilson's old seat appears to have sorted itself out for the most part.
True, some of the television advertising provocatively promotes a law-and-order theme by featuring scenes of violence from the Los Angeles riots. True, the latest anti-abortion commercial includes pictures of an abortion in progress.
And this is not inexpensive stuff, not at $10,000 or more for a 30-second advertisement, with some of the candidates planning to spend more than a million dollars on television advertising over the next 10 days.
But despite such costly, hard-edged campaigning, polls published in the last two weeks showed little has changed since surveys of a month or so ago.
According to the new surveys, Ms. Feinstein, a moderate, is headed for an easy victory in the Democratic race, in which her two opponents are State Controller Gray Davis, a liberal, and Joseph M. Alioto, a lawyer and son of a former San Francisco Mayor. She leads Mr. Davis by a 2 to 1 margin and Mr. Alioto by a margin of 8 to 1.
Trying to catch up, Mr. Davis took an uncharacteristic turn to the political right this week by broadcasting one of the law-and-order advertisements about the Los Angeles violence, prompting Ms. Feinstein to accuse him of "pandering."
Mr. Davis countered that Ms. Feinstein was "unelectable" because state authorities were investigating her handling of money in previous campaigns. The recent polls disagreed, indicating she would win handily in a two-person race with Mr. Seymour in the fall.
In the Republican primary, the new polls showed Mr. Seymour, a moderate, holding a comfortable lead over his closest opponent, Rep. William E. Dannemeyer, a conservative from Fullerton, and over his other opponent, William Barclay Allen, a conservative who was a chairman of the Federal Civil Rights Commission and is the only black running for either Senate seat.
Mr. Allen has recently drawn more notice because of his anti-abortion advertisement, which he said he intended to "advance public understanding" for the need to stop abortions.
Mr. Seymour stuck with the racial violence issue, urging legislation that would provide Federal aid to clean up and restore the part of Los Angeles destroyed by rioting. Mr. Allen and Mr. Dannemeyer opposed such help, saying it would "reward" lawlessness.
 
Feinstein on Women
 In emphasizing women's issues, Ms. Feinstein mostly speaks generally, leveling few anti-women charges at her opponents.
Polls indicate her positions attract more votes from women than from men, but she nevertheless has strong support among men.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Campaign Finances;
Lobbyists Favor Senator By Financing Son's Race

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 23

 BODY:
Tens of thousands of dollars of political donations are pouring in to Bennett Johnston from lobbyists for the energy, pipeline, utilities and nuclear power industries, according to reports at the Federal Election Commission.
That would not be surprising if the donations were to Senator J. Bennett Johnston, the chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, who has solicited and received political donations from these groups for years. But Senator Johnston, a Louisiana Democrat, is not up for re-election this year. 
 The donations are going instead to his 32-year-old son, J. Bennett Johnston 3d, who is running for Congress from Marin County, Calif. With the enthusiastic help of his father, the younger Mr. Johnston has so far raised a handsome campaign fund of $324,000, outpacing all his opponents.
 
Senator Pushes Son
 Much of it is from lobbyists in Washington who have business before his father's committee. The senior Mr. Johnston has herded many of these lobbyists into his office or to lunches with his son. In those meetings, Senator Johnston said, he has strongly urged them to support his son's candidacy.
Almost all of them have obliged.
Some of the lobbyists, who refused to be quoted by name, said they were giving to the younger Mr. Johnston's Congressional campaign to keep on the good side of the Senator. And therein lies an irony: the younger Mr. Johnston is an ardent environmental advocate who strongly disagrees with many of his father's views about the industries that are rushing to support his candidacy.
Mr. Johnston is the national director of land conservation for the Trust for Public Land, a not-for-profit organization that tries to acquire and preserve open spaces. He opposes offshore drilling and exploration for oil in the Arctic, positions supported by his father. He also strongly favors abortion rights, while his father takes the opposite view.
 
Addressed Environmental Rally
 Daniel F. Becker, a lawyer who works on energy matters in Washington for the Sierra Club, said that when his organization held a rally last summer in San Francisco to denounce an energy bill sponsored by Senator Johnston, the younger Mr. Johnston appeared and asked to be allowed to address the crowd.
"It was quite amazing," Mr. Becker recalled. "He took the microphone and said, 'Dad, I love you, but it's time we stopped this kind of special-interest legislation.' "
Among the donors to Mr. Johnston's campaign are the Alabama Power Company Employees Political Action Committee; Arkla, a pipeline company, and Southern Nuclear Operating Company Employees PAC.
Also giving to the younger Mr. Johnston are a slew of lobbying organizations representing other industries and professions.
The younger Mr. Johnston, who is one of nine candidates seeking the Democratic nomination in California's Sixth District in the June 2 primary, said in an interview that people give to candidates for many reasons.
"There are people who are contributing to my campaign who have met me through my father," he said. "But the suggestion that they are doing so to gain influence with my father is nonsense."
 
Refuses Oil Money
 He said he has refused to accept certain kinds of contributions, notably those from oil companies and weapon manufacturers. A donation from the Occidental Petroleum Company listed on his campaign records is a mistake, he said, probably a result of a mix-up between his and his father's political committees.
Mr. Johnston cheerfully acknowledges his differences with his father.
"I'm an intense environmentalist," he said. "That's my principal identity." His father's principal identity, on the other hand, is as an advocate of the energy industry, which plays a major role in Louisiana's economy.
Senator Johnston said it was unfair of environmentalists to characterize him as "the Darth Vader of the environment," but he acknowledged profound policy differences with his son.
 
Distasteful but Necessary
 Asked about the fund-raising, Senator Johnston said, "It's certainly true that I'm helping him as much as I can with my friends." He characterized the business of raising campaign money as distasteful but necessary.
Father and son share the same principal fund-raiser, Cheryl Shelby. When Ms. Shelby is not raising money for the Johnstons, she is an aide on Senator Johnston's staff.
Mr. Becker of the Sierra Club said there was little mystery about why many of the lobbyists donated to the younger Johnston's campaign. "Every piece of energy legislation is either written by or has to pass through Bennett Johnston," he said. "If he asks you for a donation to his son, you give it."
Michael Hogan, the director of the PAC for the American Chiropractors Association, which gave the maximum $5,000 donation to Mr. Johnston, said he did so after being invited to lunch by the Senator to meet his son. Also invited to that lunch was a lobbyist for the concrete industry.
Lobbyists for the insurance, health and energy industries said they, too, had been invited to Senator Johnston's office in the Capitol to meet his son. One who spoke only on the condition of anonymity said Senator Johnston asked for support for his son. When the Senator disclosed that his son worked as an environmental advocate, the lobbyist said, one representative of an energy group "looked as if he'd been whacked in the head."

HEADLINE: Las Vegas's Hopes Leave Blacks Bitter

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS, May 22

 BODY:
When gambling boomed in the 1980's, this flamboyant city dangled the promise of thousands of jobs for those without college diplomas or special skills, as factory towns once did, but with a lot more glitter.
If any place in America could lend hope to the jobless of its inner city, it seemed to be Las Vegas, which led the nation in job and population growth through the decade. 
 But as casinos and the sun nurtured handsome new subdivisions on every edge of the city, the poor, overwhelmingly black neighborhoods a few miles from The Strip remained mired in decay and hopelessness.
For most Las Vegans, it was a forgotten world -- until the gunshots and fires erupted.
 
Looters and Snipers
 A wave of violence hit the city's black neighborhoods after the April 29 acquittal of four white police officers in the beating in Los Angeles of Rodney G. King, the black motorist. In a handful of troubled nights since the acquittals, looters raided and burned several stores and offices, snipers rained gunfire on intersections, a man suspected of looting a burning building died in the flames and one white motorist was pulled from his car and beaten.
The violence occurred about seven miles from the Strip, and officials emphasize that the city is by and large calm, with no major incidents reported in the last six days. "This in no way, shape or form comes close to what has happened in Los Angeles," Lieut. Charlie Davidaitis said.
But to many residents in a city that thrives on unlimited opportunity, the woes in the midst of plenty underscore a missed chance to heed a desperate call.
"Things could be so different here," said the Rev. Jesse Scott, the leader of the local National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. "The potential for our people should be so great in Las Vegas. But we've only gotten just a little bit of the pie. And our people feel hopeless."
 
Isolation in Growth
 After a decade of growth, Las Vegas now has 300,000 residents, 11 percent of them black. But the growth has done little for the section of the city that has historically been black, except to make its name, the West Side, something of a geographic misnomer. The city's sprawling corporate limits now extend much farther to the west.
If anything, the black neighborhoods have become even more isolated, more than 25 blocks bereft of commerce and marked by rows of identical, low-slung, cement-block housing projects, which give it the uniform look of a military base.
The city has grown around the West Side, and the riots only made it worse. Fires destroyed a job training center, a medical center, a black-owned gas station and the local headquarters of the N.A.A.C.P. City officials say the riots caused $6 million in property damage and eliminated more than 200 jobs.
"This has set us back 20 years," said Yvonne Atkinson Gates, a black former school board member who is running for a post on the Clark County Commission. "I stood in my backyard and watched the flames and heard the gunshots. It makes me so angry."
 
Years of Discrimination
 But the anger that fed the riots was fueled by more than despair at not finding a job. Years ago, black people in Las Vegas called the city the "Mississippi of the West" for its racism.
Lured west in the 1930's by the construction of the Hoover Dam and the emergence of the hotel industry, blacks for generations were kept from living anywhere in Las Vegas except the West Side. But today the number of blacks living in more integrated neighborhoods surpasses the number on the West Side, and after the riots, Mr. Scott said, people from all over the city helped clean up the debris.
Still, the acquittal of the Los Angeles police officers had a familiar ring here. A black casino dealer was choked to death by three Las Vegas police officers two years ago, and a jury acquitted them of murder charges last year.
The astonishing rate of growth in Las Vegas has slowed a bit in the last year, as the recession dampened the casino business. Unemployment, which had dipped below 5 percent in 1990, rose to 6.5 percent in March, though it was still under the 7.3 percent national rate. But the economy has started to rebound, and three new casinos, which are scheduled to open next year, will provide 20,000 jobs.
But people on the West Side say the hotel and casino jobs have not been going to black workers. "You go into the hotels and see who's working," said Gene Collins, a former State Assemblyman. "People from Asia, Mexico, South America."
Hotel officials say the work force on The Strip has indeed become much more international in recent years. "At any given casino, there are workers who speak 40 or more languages," said Van Heffner, the president of the Nevada Hotel and Motel Association.
Mr. Heffner said black workers have not been excluded but rather forced to compete with the changing makeup of the job market. The population in Clark County grew by nearly 40 percent in the 1980's, to about 700,000, 9.5 percent of it black. The foreign-born population doubled in that time, and now almost one in every seven people in the Las Vegas area has a native language other than English.
Rosa Mayorga, a 24-year-old immigrant from Guatemala, came to Las Vegas in 1989 for a job as a maid at The Residence Inn. "I make $8 an hour here," said Ms. Mayorga, who was named Employee of the Year last year. "I have television, VCR, telephone. It's very different than Guatemala."
 
Crime Rate Is Low
 Though the city's crime rate remains far below that of other major cities, the police say Los Angeles gangs have established outposts here, leading to 17 gang-related homicides last year, up from 11 the year before.
West Side residents say violence is an everyday fact of life. "There's always someone getting shot," said Bessie Braggs, who runs a food bank on the West Side. "We have bars on our windows, bars on our doors."
As fires burned other buildings in the recent violence, a black-owned restaurant, Chez's, went untouched. But one recent morning only a few customers had ventured inside for breakfast.
"Usually we'd be packed," said Tarisha Hughes, a 24-year-old waitress, whose tips have dwindled since the riots. "But people are afraid to come outside."
Ms. Gates, the county commission candidate, was born to a bricklayer and hotel maid and has lived all of her life on the West Side. Her brother, Eddie, was stabbed to death while he was walking down the street a few weeks before the riots.
"The police have witnesses, but nobody is willing to talk," she said. "These young punks threaten your life if you talk."
The everyday violence has left her son, Brian, too frightened to play outdoors. "He's 9 years old, and he's too scared to play outside," she said, shaking her head.
Her husband, Lee Gates, is a district judge, and they can afford to live in the safest, most prosperous neighborhood in town. But she said she would stay on the West Side.
"If I left, people would say I'm deserting them," she said. "And they would be right."
She added: "But I take my son to a tutor for Spanish and art classes. I want him to know there is something outside of this world of violence."
