HEADLINE: California Democrats Revive Universal Health Plan

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
Democrats in California revived a bill on Thursday that would create a single-payer, universal health care system in the state.
 While the move came as questions arose over the prospects of Congress adopting national health care legislation, the author of the California bill, State Senator Mark Leno, said that the timing was coincidental. Mr. Leno said it was basically a long-planned reintroduction of a 2009 proposal that was effectively tabled because of its potential cost. But he did concede that Tuesday's special Senate election in Massachusetts, in which Democrats lost their filibuster-proof 60-vote majority, was not completely lost on him.
 ''Scott Brown did not push me to do this,'' said Mr. Leno, referring to the newly elected Republican senator from Massachusetts. But, he said, ''as a result of Tuesday's election, there is ever greater need for leadership in state legislatures to reform health care.'' 
 Regardless of its relation to the debate in Washington, Republicans in Sacramento jumped at the opportunity to slam the Democratic plan, which would establish a statewide health care system to cover all residents, using a new state agency to negotiate and set fees for services and pay claims. 
 ''California Democrats are either tone-deaf or delusional,'' Ron Nehring, the California Republican Party chairman, said in a statement. ''They're determined to double down on a $200 billion health care plan that voters don't want and taxpayers can't afford.''
 Christine Kehoe, a San Diego Democrat and the chairwoman of the State Senate appropriations committee, which revived Mr. Leno's bill, said the costs to the state would be $1 million in the next fiscal year because the bill would only initially create a commission to find ways to pay for expanded health care. 
 And while Ms. Kehoe said a single-payer system could cost ''tens of billions a year,'' she added that the state was already paying significant amounts for other publicly financed health care programs. She said Mr. Leno's bill -- which would also expand eligibility for Medi-Cal, California's Medicaid program -- would eventually result in the state saving money. 
 ''The cost of health care insurance in California is a major hindrance to our economy,'' said Ms. Kehoe, citing large numbers of uninsured and people paying high rates. ''If we could begin to trim some of those costs, there would be billions of dollars going into the economy for more productive use.''
 The bill is not the first attempt to set up a single-payer system in California, which has some 6.5 million uninsured. Two previous single-payer bills were passed by the legislature in recent years, only to be vetoed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who tried and failed to establish his own universal health care plan at the start of his second term in 2007. On Thursday, Mr. Schwarzenegger, a Republican, again expressed his displeasure with a single-payer proposal, calling it at odds with fiscal reality, including a looming $20 billion budget gap in the state.
 ''The governor continues to oppose any single-payer government run health care system,'' said Rachel Arrezola, a spokeswoman for Mr. Schwarzenegger. 
 Mr. Schwarzenegger is in his final year in office, and Democrats seem willing to wait for the fall election. Even if the bill passed and was signed by a new governor, Mr. Leno said he fully expected that health insurance companies would lobby to have any such plan overturned via a ballot measure. 
 ''The voters get the final word,'' he said. ''And we know it.''

HEADLINE: City Bids to Save Housing Imperiled by Investors

BYLINE: By CARA BUCKLEY

 BODY:
New York City has launched a new plan to rescue moderate-rent apartment buildings that were swept up by private equity firms during the financial boom, then left to deteriorate as they drifted toward foreclosure when the new owners were unable to repay their loans.
 Under the program, the city's housing agencies will have $750 million to lend over five years, to enable new, responsible owners to buy and repair buildings that are in the most financial and physical distress. 
 About $150 million will go toward quickly providing capital for new owners to acquire such buildings; $600 million in New York City Housing Development Corporation bonds and city capital go toward buying and repairing distressed buildings. The New York City Housing Development Corporation will issue mortgages itself. 
 The city, through the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, plans to concentrate on the most beleaguered apartment complexes in the city -- 267 buildings containing 3,564 apartments that are deep in a state of disrepair and in or close to foreclosure. Roughly 100,000 apartments citywide are in buildings that are carrying too much debt, with the money owed on them greater than their current worth, according to the department.
 The former New York Mets player Mo Vaughn will be among the first developers to participate in the new initiative. Last month, Mr. Vaughn's company, Omni New York, made the winning bid at a foreclosure auction for 14 buildings in the Bronx that had been abandoned by their owner, the Ocelot Capital Group, and had fallen deep into disrepair. 
 Rafael E. Cestero, the city's housing commissioner, would not estimate the number of buildings that might be rescued by the program. But he said his agency planned to focus first on repairing and repopulating the most imperiled buildings. 
 ''Tenants are living in conditions that are unacceptable and need to be corrected,'' Mr. Cestero said. ''And buildings in that kind of physical deterioration have destabilizing impacts on other neighborhoods.''
 He said that after identifying distressed buildings, his agency would work with lenders and with experienced owners with good track records who are interested in buying the properties. The old, delinquent, owners would be pressured to sell because of housing code violations and tax liens issued if emergency repairs were made. 
 Tenants' advocates praised the city's rescue program, which was announced on Wednesday by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg in his State of the City address.
 ''They're being strategic and forward-thinking,'' said Benjamin Dulchin, executive director of the Association for Neighborhood and Housing Development, a consortium of nonprofit housing and community development groups. 
 Mr. Dulchin's agency has tracked the fallout of the financial crisis on moderate-cost apartment buildings throughout the city. During the boom, private equity investors bought many such buildings in anticipation of pushing out some existing tenants, renovating the vacant apartments, then drastically raising the rents. But they let the buildings fall into disrepair when the economy crashed and higher-paying tenants failed to materialize. 
 ''It's a chance to rein the private market back in,'' Mr. Dulchin said, of the city's new program, ''and pull the buildings out of the speculative cycle.''
 Yet Howard Husock, vice president for policy research of the Manhattan Institute, a conservative policy group, questioned whether the $750 million would be money well spent in such lean times. It would be better, he said, to let the buildings go through bankruptcy proceedings, which he said would best determine what they were really worth.
 ''If owners aren't given an expectation of a bailout,'' he wrote in an e-mail message, ''they will take their losses now and get buildings into hands of new long-term management.''

HEADLINE: Campaigns Walk the Invisible Tightrope

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
EVERY January, Madison Avenue gets into the betterment business, unleashing a flood of advertising that seeks to take advantage of the impulses among consumers at the start of a new year to improve themselves.
 Scores of millions of dollars are spent on campaigns for weight-loss plans, diet pills, low-calorie foods, gyms and fitness centers, smoking-cessation drugs and exercise equipment. Almost always, the pitches are upbeat and positive, seeking to instill feelings of empowerment and encouragement in those who want to effect change in their behavior and appearance.
 The typical approach is ''to say, 'You can do it,' 'Be the best you can be,' '' said Allen P. Adamson, managing director of the New York office of Landor Associates, a brand and corporate-identity consultancy that is part of the Young & Rubicam Brands unit of WPP. 
 That is in keeping with a marketing truism that ''people want to be optimistic,'' Mr. Adamson said. ''They want to feel good about things and believe in things.''
 But just as with so many other aspects of marketing, the stumbling economy and the muddled national mood are changing the ways advertisers are appealing to Americans who made resolutions for 2010.
 '' 'Don't Worry, Be Happy' is not a tune people can hear right now,'' Mr. Adamson said, adding that advertisers taking that tack ''run the risk of being considered out of touch, of being asked, 'Where have you been?' ''
 Reflecting that, the tone of many campaigns is less cheerful than in previous Januarys. For instance, ads for the Nicorette gum sold by Johnson & Johnson, which helps people stop smoking, repeatedly use a particularly blunt streetwise word that has become a synonym for ''lousy.'' 
 In one Nicorette ad, the word and its variations, none of which can be published here, appear in the headline and the tag line as well as eight times in the text. The word is used to convey a frank message: although trying to quit smoking is lousy, Nicorette makes the process less lousy.
 Some ads are assuming a more confrontational attitude, even starting fights with brands they compete against in the same product category. For example, the Promise line of spreads sold by Unilever ran newspaper ads this week attacking by name a rival, Smart Balance, sold by GFA Brands.
 The ads mocked a slogan used by Smart Balance, ''We think natural tastes better.'' The headline read: ''Smart Balance is natural? The ingredients disagree.''
 Some category battles are being waged in court. Weight Watchers International filed a lawsuit this week in a federal district court in New York against the Jenny Craig division of Nestle, charging that Jenny Craig was making deceptive claims against Weight Watchers in a commercial featuring Valerie Bertinelli. The court granted Weight Watchers a temporary restraining order, which prohibits Jenny Craig from making claims of superiority in ads.
 The new style for new year's advertising reflects the ''increasing cantankerousness'' of the country, said Marc E. Babej, president of Reason Inc. in New York, a brand and corporate strategy consulting company.
 ''You also have to wonder to what extent it is the result of pressure on marketers themselves to produce results,'' Mr. Babej said. ''If you're under pressure to produce, you're going to be more irritable, more likely to lash out, and go places where in better times you may not think to go.''
 When ''the mood is more ornery'' among consumers, Mr. Babej said, advertisers must ''strike a balance between being attuned to the mood of the audience and keeping their focus on the benefit of their products, which is an inherently positive message.''
 Mr. Adamson agreed. ''It's a tightrope to walk,'' he said. ''There's a place for a more realistic, tell-it-like-it-is attitude even though in the long run, a more optimistic tone will be more successful.''
 The answer, according to Mr. Adamson, is to run campaigns that are ''not too negative, not too much of a downer,'' or in other words, ''more realistic, but not so realistic you rub people's noses in it.''
 Some marketers are trying to steer that course. A campaign from General Mills for a restaged version of its venerable Wheaties cereal, renamed Wheaties Fuel and aimed at men, carries a theme, ''Prepare to win,'' that is optimistic without making Pollyannaish claims of guaranteed victory.
 Similarly, a campaign for Equinox fitness clubs, owned by Equinox Holdings, asks potential members to ''start the journey'' in a campaign that carries the theme ''My body. My biography.'' 
 The campaign, with a budget estimated at $3 million, is created by a New York agency named Yard and includes a microsite, or special Web site (mybodymybiography.com), where people can share stories about the role fitness plays in their lives.
 ''It's not 'I lost 10 pounds' or 'I look better in this dress,' '' said Stephen Niedzwiecki, creative director at Yard. ''It's more about a long-term partnership'' between members and Equinox ''than about short-term results,'' he added.
 Ruth Bernstein, head of strategy at Yard, said the goal was to present the Equinox brand ''in a way that's more authentic and emotional,'' compared with ads not too long ago that were more about happily ever after. 

CORRECTION-DATE: January 30, 2010

 CORRECTION:
The Advertising column on Jan. 22, about a changing approach in campaigns for self-improvement products, misidentified the company running a campaign for Nicorette gum. It is GlaxoSmithKline, not Johnson & Johnson. (Johnson & Johnson owns Nicorette, but licenses it to GlaxoSmithKline for sale in the United States market.)

HEADLINE: Air America, the Talk Radio Network, Will Go Off the Air

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

 BODY:
Air America, the long-suffering progressive talk radio network, abruptly shut down on Thursday, bowing to what it called a ''very difficult economic environment.''
 The chairman of Air America Media, Charlie Kireker, said in a statement that the company would file under Chapter 7 bankruptcy ''to carry out an orderly winding-down of the business.'' 
 In a troubled time for advertising-driven media businesses, ''our painstaking search for new investors has come close several times right up into this week but ultimately fell short of success,'' Mr. Kireker said.
 The closing did not come as a surprise. Air America, which began six years ago and has 100 affiliated stations, cycled through a number of owners and never found its financial footing. It first filed for bankruptcy protection in 2006 but managed to stay on the air.
 ''The fact of the matter was, it was always a very challenging business proposition, and it never had the right management,'' said Sam Seder, who hosted programs on Air America until last year.
 Although it lacked a substantial audience, the network catapulted a number of progressive media personalities into stardom, most notably Rachel Maddow, who now anchors a prime-time program on the cable news channel MSNBC. 
 Al Franken, now a Democratic senator from Minnesota, hosted an Air America show from 2004 to 2007, before running for office.
 Several other prominent talk radio personalities who worked at Air America, including Randi Rhodes and Thom Hartmann, remain on the radio, but without the network affiliation. ''It would be a shame if the world sees the failure of Air America as representing the failure of progressive talk radio,'' said Michael Harrison, the editor of Talkers Magazine, a talk radio publication.
 Mr. Kireker noted in his statement that advertising revenue in the radio industry had fallen for several years now. ''Signs of improvement have consisted of hoping things will be less bad,'' he said, adding that ''our company cannot escape the laws of economics.''
 Air America started to play rerun programming rather suddenly Thursday evening. The company said it would sign off completely next Monday night.

HEADLINE: Unexpected Rise in Jobless Claims Hints at a Bump in the Recovery

BYLINE: By REUTERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The number of new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose last week and regional manufacturing activity slipped in January, hinting at some slowing in the economic recovery.
 The Labor Department said on Thursday that initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 36,000 last week, to 482,000, as a backlog of applications from the holidays was processed. It was the third consecutive week that claims rose. 
 Analysts had expected new claims to slip to 440,000.
 Separate data showed that factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region slowed in January to a three-month low, while a gauge of economic prospects set a record high last month.
 ''The recovery of the U.S. economy continues, but it's at a slower pace than we have seen at the end of 2009. The biggest problem is companies remain reluctant to expand their capacities, which is weighing on the labor market,'' said Harm Bandholz, an economist at Unicredit Research in New York.
 Analysts say they believe the economy grew at an annual rate of 4 to 5 percent in the fourth quarter, accelerating from the 2.2 percent rate in the July-September period.
 The Labor Department said the jump in initial claims for jobless aid last week was administrative and not economic.
 At least one analyst, however, interpreted the data differently.
 ''That implies claims in previous weeks were understated, so the reduction in new jobless claims between December and January is not as extreme as had been thought,'' said Pierre Ellis, senior economist at Decision Economics in New York. ''But with layoffs diminishing, the labor market is still gradually healing.''
 Analysts were not too troubled by the drop in the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank's business activity index, which fell to 15.2 this month as orders declined.
 The index, which measures factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region, hit a four-and-a-half-year high of 22.5 in December. Markets had expected the index for January to come in at 18. A reading above zero indicates growth in the region's manufacturing sector.
 The survey's employment index rose to its highest level since February 2008.
 ''The data still point to growth in activity this month, and we don't see any need to significantly alter our view that the factory sector is shifting from being on the mend to steady expansion,'' said Omair Sharif, an economist at RBS Securities in Stamford, Conn.
 Bolstering views that the recovery remains intact, the Conference Board, a business research group, said its index of leading economic indicators rose 1.1 percent last month, to a record high of 106.4.
 Although the Labor Department report also showed that the four-week moving average of new jobless claims, a measure of underlying trends, ended 19 weeks of declines last week, it remained below the 450,000 level analysts consider to indicate stability in the labor market.
 The number of workers still collecting benefits after an initial week of aid fell to the lowest since January 2009.
 The drop probably reflected people exhausting their unemployment benefits rather than a pickup in hiring. There were 5.9 million people receiving extended benefits under special programs at the beginning of January.

HEADLINE: Economy In Shock Struggles To Restart

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO; Marc Lacey contributed reporting.

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti 

 BODY:
The price of candles in the teeming La Saline market here has climbed 60 percent since last week's earthquake. A box of matches is up 50 percent. A package of Perdue Chicken Franks has gone up 30 percent. 
 As Haitians begin to turn their attention to rebuilding a crippled economy, the rapid surge in prices of crucial products is just one of the many challenges they face. 
 The port here was also knocked out of operation, hobbling exports. The banking system, largely shut down because of fear of robberies, is struggling to restart. The earthquake destroyed the finance ministry and part of the central bank, and killed senior financial officials including Jean Frantz Richard, director of the tax collection agency.
 ''The shock to the economy is huge, affecting perhaps 50 percent of our G.D.P.,'' said Daniel Dorsainvil, a former finance minister. ''Banks are afraid to reopen because of security fears, and we may have to go through the Dominican Republic to start importing and exporting again. ''Catastrophe is almost too kind a word for our predicament.''
 The disaster's devastating blows landed on an economy about one-tenth the size of New Mexico's that was already feeble and struggling before the quake. 
 Still, some of the most immediate economic problems may be starting to ease. Gasoline is more readily available than in the first days after the earthquake, helping to relieve a thriving black market in which some street dealers were selling the fuel for as much as $8 a gallon. Remittances from Haitians living abroad have begun flowing here again after Western Union reopened some of its branches in the capital.
 Foreign and government officials here are seeking to address a number of other problems, starting with the lack of money in the economy. Eric Overvest, the Haiti director for the United Nations Development Program, said that a new program would pay Haitians $3 a day to work for two-week periods to infuse cash into the economy. Almost 400 people began the work this week, and with about $4 million to disburse the program is expected to grow into the thousands.
 The work involves clearing roads, ridding public areas of rubble and collecting corpses, some of which were being burned Thursday. 
 ''The economy is totally stalled,'' Mr. Overvest said. ''Giving a cash infusion means shops will open. The $3 will go to the shopkeepers, who will buy more supplies and the money will be passed along. It will have a tremendous catalytic effect on the entire economy.''
 Haiti's economy was on rough footing before the quake, with more than 70 percent of the population surviving on $2 or less a day. But it was also showing signs of improvement, growing 2.9 percent in 2009, one of the hemisphere's highest rates. Higher public spending, debt forgiveness by rich nations and an expanding textile industry, which provides more than 90 percent of export revenues, contributed to the growth.
 The earthquake effectively shut down most textile companies, many of which are in the capital to be close to the port. In what may have been the earthquake's largest loss of life in a single location, at least 500 people were killed at a Palm Apparel T-shirt factory near the airport, hitting the business empire of Alain Villard, one of Haiti's largest manufacturers.
 The quake also put into motion distortions like price gouging and an unexpected strengthening of the currency, the gourde, by more than 25 percent to a rate of about 30 to the dollar for some transactions. Fritz Jean, a former governor of the central bank, said the surge in the gourde's value could be explained in part by the sharp drop in oil imports since the earthquake, keeping more dollars in Haiti's economy.
 Haiti's huge informal sector reacted faster to the quake than did established companies and banks. Outdoor markets like La Saline are already filled with goods from the countryside, including salt, cornmeal, fruits like mangoes and used clothing from the United States.
 Economists here said that skyrocketing prices for some items, notably ice, which has doubled in price in some parts of the city, are related to the continuing lack of electrical service and efforts to extract quick profits amid uncertainty over what lies ahead.
 ''People want candles because they have no electricity or fuel for their generators,'' said Manouchka Wendiwou, 21, a vendor in La Saline who raised her candle prices by 60 percent and made no apology for charging what the market would bear.
 Charles Castel, the governor of the central bank, said in a telephone interview that such distortions should ease as services returned and the banking system started functioning again. Banks were expected to open their doors again in the interior on Thursday and in the capital by Friday or Saturday, he said.
 Still, major economic challenges remain, including the damage to critical infrastructure like the port here, which is expected to partially resume operations in the coming days, and the displacement of as many as one million people in Port-au-Prince. 
 The Inter-American Development Bank said it planned to finance as much as $300 million in recovery projects, focusing on constructing thousands of new homes, putting up new government buildings and creating industrial parks. 
 The World Bank said Thursday that it would waive payments on Haiti's debt for the next five years, and the International Monetary Fund proposed an interest-free loan of $100 million.
 ''Right now people have to eat, and then they have to be able to find work,'' Eduardo Almeida, a Brazilian who is the development bank's Haiti representative, said. ''We need to start creating opportunities for the population as soon as we can.''

HEADLINE: City's Jobless Rate Rises to 10.6%, Exceeding Nation's

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
The unemployment rate in New York City jumped in December to 10.6 percent, its highest level in nearly 17 years, as hotels, museums and builders eliminated jobs and hiring remained weak in most other businesses, the State Labor Department said Thursday. 
 Last month marked the first time since the recession began two years ago that the city's unemployment rate was significantly higher than the nation's. The city's rate rose from 10 percent in November, while the national rate held steady at 10 percent last month, according to the Labor Department. 
 Nearly 425,000 city residents were unable to find jobs in December, easily the highest total in the 33 years those records have been kept. The numbers were announced a day after New Jersey officials said that their state's unemployment rate hit a 33-year high of 10.1 percent in December. New York State's unemployment rate also rose, to 9 percent from 8.6 percent in November.
 ''The city's rate is obviously the most disturbing one in the mix,'' said M. Patricia Smith, the state labor commissioner. ''What this shows is that the economy is still volatile. People are still nervous about the economy.''
 Analysts said the unemployment rate could continue rising and was not likely to reverse direction before midyear. After the last two recessions, employment in the metropolitan area did not begin to rise for at least 10 months, said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University.
 ''We're not going to see a return to job growth before the middle of 2010 -- if we're lucky,'' Dean Hughes said. ''The small-business sector still has severe credit problems. Banks simply aren't lending to them. If they don't get credit, they certainly aren't going to be able to start hiring again.''
 The numbers reflected the damp blanket the long recession cast over the city during the holidays. The city's restaurants and catering operations shed about 2,000 jobs in December, a month when the hospitality industry usually adds to its payroll. 
 Stores in the city added about 4,500 jobs in the month, but for the entire holiday season, retail hiring still lagged behind its usual pace, said James Brown, a Labor Department analyst. Still, Mr. Brown said, ''Christmas '09 as a whole was actually an improvement from last year's disastrous holiday season.''
 Mr. Brown said one bright spot in the data was an apparent turnaround on Wall Street.
 Financial-services companies had been among the first to make sharp cuts in employment as the recession deepened. Those layoffs reverberated throughout the regional economy because the jobs paid so highly and supported so many workers in other service businesses. 
 Now, with some of the big investment banks racking up huge profits again, they have begun to hire selectively. Wall Street firms added about 1,000 jobs in December, though total employment in finance was still down by more than 16,000 positions from the end of 2008, the data showed.
 ''It looks like they might be bottoming out,'' Mr. Brown said. 
 Statewide, more than 610,000 residents were collecting unemployment insurance at the end of the year. More than half of them had been collecting benefits for more than six months.
 ''The fact that we have so many more people on unemployment is evidence of the fact that they need the benefits longer,'' Ms. Smith said. 
 Signaling that the worst is not over, state labor officials are about to start contacting employers in the city and on Long Island that they fear might soon resort to layoffs. Using emergency federal funds, they will offer to help the companies avert or minimize job cuts, Ms. Smith said. 
 Those efforts apparently will not save the jobs of 228 workers at a bakery in the Morris Park section of the Bronx that makes Melba Toast and other snacks. The bakery's owner, Old London Foods, notified the state that it planned to move the operation to North Carolina by summer.

HEADLINE: Entrenched Monarchy Thwarts Aspirations for Modernity

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SLACKMAN; Mona El-Naggar contributed reporting from Dubai.

DATELINE: CAIRO 

 BODY:
In the heady days of the Dubai gold rush, when real estate sold and resold even before a shovel hit the ground, the ambitious emirate was hailed as the model of Middle Eastern modernity, a boomtown that built an effective, efficient and accessible form of government. 
 Then the crash came and revealed how paper-thin that image was, political and financial analysts said. That realization, not just in Dubai but also in Abu Dhabi, the oil-rich capital of the United Arab Emirates, has cast a harsh light on an opaque, top-down decision-making process, not just in business but in matters of crime and punishment as well, political and financial analysts said.
 The financial crisis and now two criminal cases that have generated critical headlines in other countries have demonstrated that the emirates remain an absolute monarchy, where institutions are far less important than royalty and where the law is particularly capricious -- applied differently based on social standing, religion and nationality, political experts and human rights advocates said. 
 ''I think what we learned here the last four months is that the government, at least on a political level, is still very undeveloped,'' said a financial analyst based in Dubai who asked not to be identified to avoid compromising his ability to work in the emirates. ''It's very difficult to read or interpret or understand what is going on. The institutions have not shaped up to people's expectations.''
 The most recent of the criminal cases occurred Dec. 31, when a British tourist, a Muslim, reported to the police that she was raped in a public bathroom of a luxury hotel in Dubai. Instead of being consoled, she and her fiance, who had gone with her to report the attack, were arrested and charged with having illegal sex because they were not yet married, and with drinking alcohol in an unauthorized location. 
 ''Scandal Under Arab Law,'' said a headline in The Sun, a British tabloid.
 Then, in another case that had already provoked widespread outrage, a court acquitted a member of Abu Dhabi's royal family, Sheik Issa bin Zayed al-Nahayan, of charges of torturing an Afghan merchant. In May, ABC News broadcast portions of a 45-minute video that showed Sheik Issa beating the man with a whip, a cattle prod and a wooden plank with a protruding nail, and firing bullets at him before driving over his legs with a sport utility vehicle. 
 The case went to trial under pressure from the international community, including the United States Congress, which had threatened to hold up approval of a deal that would allow the emirates to receive advanced civilian nuclear technology. The controversy eased when the emirates arrested Sheik Issa and agreed to put him on trial. The nuclear deal was signed in December.
 While international human rights groups expected a conviction, residents of the emirates did not. Sheik Issa's brother, Sheik Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahayan, is the emir of Abu Dhabi and the president of the United Arab Emirates.
 The local residents proved prescient.
 On Jan. 10, the judge in the case said that Sheik Issa had ''diminished liability'' because he had been on prescription drugs when he took the man to his farm, shoved sand in his face and mouth, pulled his pants down and beat him. The sheik was set free.
 ''This reminds us we are dealing with a ruling monarchy,'' said Christopher Davidson, a senior lecturer at the University of Durham in England who has written several books about the emirates. ''We are dealing with the deification of this one branch of the ruling family. Any son of the family is a god.''
 The acquittal was especially troubling, human rights groups said, because the court sentenced to prison three others seen in the video aiding Sheik Issa. It also handed out five-year prison sentences (in absentia) to the two men who made and distributed the video, saying they were guilty of meddling with the sheik's medication and recording and distributing an unauthorized video. The men, who live in the United States, have denied the charges.
 ''If the U.A.E. thinks that it is going to address the international outrage with a hush-hush trial that acquits him, they are in for a big surprise,'' said Sarah Leah Whitson, director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. ''There is going to be a great deal of focus on what is wrong with the U.A.E. justice system and what is wrong with impunity in the U.A.E. itself.''
 A spokesman for Abu Dhabi said the ruling family had no comment on the court case.
 The case of the British tourist added fuel to the fire that was already burning through the emirates' image in the West. It was reported widely in the British news media, stoking outrage. 
 The couple had traveled to Dubai to celebrate New Year's Eve. The woman was 23, Muslim and of Pakistani descent, the man 44. No other details of their identities have been made public.
 The woman told the police that she was raped by a Syrian waiter who worked in the hotel. When she and her fiance went to the Jebel Ali police department the next day to report the attack, they found themselves being questioned about their own relationship and arrested.
 They were put in a holding cell, charged and released on bail. Their passports were taken, and they are being forced to remain in the emirates pending the outcome of an investigation. The National, a daily newspaper based in Abu Dhabi, reported that the police now doubt a rape occurred at all. They say hotel security video supports the suspect's contention that he did not enter the bathroom after the woman. 
 ''This sort of a prosecution, as a response to a claim of rape, besides striking me as grossly unfair and cruel, also is indicative of the arbitrary way in which the U.A.E. enforces its laws,'' Ms. Whitson said. 
 Mr. Davidson, the university lecturer, said the decision to charge the couple also illustrated an old truth about Dubai's social structure: that there were different rules for different nationalities and religions, especially on questions of morality. The woman and her fiance probably received that treatment because she was Muslim, he said. 
 During the boom years, Mr. Davidson said, Westerners in particular could normally violate morality laws without fear of arrest, and prostitution was widespread, though there were exceptions. In one such case, a British couple was arrested and faced prison after having sex on a beach, but only after ignoring an earlier warning to stop. They were eventually deported, after receiving suspended three-month sentences. Lt. Col. Abdul Qadir Al Bannai, director of the Jebel Ali police station, when reached by telephone said that he had no time to speak about the couple in the rape case. But in an interview published recently in Gulf News, a newspaper in the emirates, he defended his department's actions, saying: ''Our rules are clear in the U.A.E.; illegal drinking and sexual intercourse is considered an offense, so a case was filed against the couple as well. But we didn't ignore the rape report.'' He told the newspaper that the Syrian accused of rape was in custody now.
 The couple faces up to six years in prison if the case is brought to trial and they are convicted.
 ''It's awful,'' Mr. Davidson said, ''but it's extremely predictable.''

HEADLINE: Conference of Mayors Stresses Need for New Round of Stimulus Money

BYLINE: By IAN URBINA

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Saying that last year's $787 billion economic stimulus plan has failed to ease urban unemployment, the nation's mayors are asking the federal government for a second wave of stimulus money. 
 ''We need another stimulus infusion, something that most economists say is the only thing that may turn the unemployment rate around,'' said Joseph P. Riley Jr., the mayor of Charleston, S.C., and a Democrat.
 More than 230 mayors are in Washington for the winter meeting of the United States Conference of Mayors, and many said they had been forced to impose layoffs, furloughs, service reductions and fee increases to deal with falling municipal revenue. The next fiscal year looks even worse, they said.
 ''We are in the middle of a 'jobs emergency' that demands decisive and swift action,'' said Elizabeth Kautz, the mayor of Burnsville, Minn., and president of the conference. ''We need the Senate to pass a Main Street jobs package now.'' 
 Mayor Kautz is a Republican, and while many Republicans in Congress oppose a second stimulus package, many of the Republican mayors here support it.
 President Obama spoke before dozens of the mayors on Thursday, promising ''a continued, sustained and relentless effort to create good jobs.''
 In November, the latest month for which data is available, the jobless rate was up in all 363 of the cities surveyed by the conference, compared with the previous year. More than 105 metro areas have unemployment rates above 10 percent.
 Even as recovery in the labor markets picks up steam in the next three years, unemployment rates will not return to pre-recession levels during that period for any metro area, the conference predicted.
 ''In the Great Depression they let up too soon and there was further recession,'' Mayor Riley said. ''Right now the president needs to avoid making that same mistake.''
 Mayor Richard M. Daley of Chicago called for long-term tax breaks for companies that hire new workers. 
 ''We're competing in a global economy. They're paying people $3 an hour in some places,'' he said. ''So, how do we compete in the quality of life we want to give somebody? We give them tax advantages for the life of that employee.''
 Instead of receiving the help they need, cities are being deprived of the federal aid owed to them, the mayors said.
 The nation's top 85 metro areas are not receiving their appropriate share of federal stimulus spending in the form of surface transportation funds allocated by the states, the conference said. 
 A June 2009 study conducted by the conference found that only 48 percent of approved surface-transportation financing was allocated by states to metro areas, even though these metro areas represented about 63 percent of the states' total populations and produced about 73 percent of the states' gross domestic product.
 The conference's annual report found regional discrepancies in the impact of the recession. The West, Upper Midwest and Southwest regions of the country have been particularly affected.
 ''Unemployment has skyrocketed in these areas because they have been hit particularly hard by the correction in the real estate market and/or are heavily dependent on the manufacturing sector,'' the report said.

HEADLINE: A State With Less to Lose

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
In hindsight, it should probably come as little surprise to Democrats that voters in Massachusetts, a state with universal access to health insurance, would not feel all that motivated to rescue President Obama's efforts to provide similar benefits nationwide. 
 Massachusetts has the lowest proportion of uninsured residents of any state in the nation -- just 5.2 percent, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation -- thanks to the state's 2006 universal health care law, which the winner in Tuesday's special election, Scott Brown, supported as a Republican state senator and which was signed by Gov. Mitt Romney, also a Republican.
 So while health economists say Massachusetts, which is still struggling to control its health care costs, has much to gain from a nationwide overhaul, the voters in Massachusetts have far less to lose than residents of other state if the bill dies.
 Texas, for instance, has the highest percentage of residents without health insurance in the country: 25.2 percent.
 Texas also happens to be home to Senator John Cornyn, below, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, who is getting a lot of credit for aiding the victory in Massachusetts and effectively stalling the Democrats' health bill.
 Mr. Cornyn, however, saw no contradiction between his party's political needs and the policy needs of many of his constituents. Like other Republicans, he has argued that the Democrats' bill is the wrong way to expand insurance coverage, in part because it would force the state to spend billions of dollars to expand Medicaid. 
 ''Rather than expanding government programs -- like Medicaid -- that taxpayers can't afford and that aren't working for patients, Congress needs to take meaningful, targeted steps to make coverage more affordable,'' said Kevin McLaughlin, a spokesman for Mr. Cornyn.

HEADLINE: Hard Work, Not Miracles, Ahead for City

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN. 
E-mail: haberman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Right after Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg delivered his State of the City address last year, a miracle occurred. That's what people instantly called the wondrous landing of US Airways Flight 1549 on the Hudson River -- a miracle -- though maybe, just maybe, the skill of the pilots, the design of their Airbus A320 and the swift response of New York rescue crews had something to do with everyone getting out alive.
 On Wednesday, the mayor gave his latest State of the City talk. There were no miracles, not after his speech and certainly not during it. 
 This was a speech of lowered expectations. If it were a baseball game, it could be described as dominated by singles, not home runs. It was a speech that essentially told New Yorkers to forget about miracles and just try to get through tough times with as little pain as possible. Mr. Bloomberg, who has never been mistaken for Demosthenes, raced through much of his text with all the enthusiasm that one might devote to a cafeteria menu.
 A possible reason for the lack of much hoopla was that it was his first such address in a while that did not double as a campaign speech. Two Januarys ago, the mayor was fantasizing about an independent run for the White House. Last January, he had a suddenly possible third term at City Hall on the brain. This year, the imperative for lots of bells and whistles was far less powerful.
 The setting on Wednesday was pleasant enough: a handsome building in Astoria, Queens, that is the new home of the Frank Sinatra School of the Arts. Until this academic year, this high school had been in temporary quarters since it came into being a week before the attacks of September 2001.
 Sinatra was undoubtedly less familiar with Astoria than with the Waldorf-Astoria. But he was a friend of the school's founders, a husband and wife who know the music business, and they wanted the school to be named for him. The husband, Anthony Benedetto, grew up in Astoria. You probably know him better as Tony Bennett.
 It fell to him on Wednesday to introduce the speaker. Mr. Bloomberg may sound as if he left his native Massachusetts barely a month ago, but there was no mistaking Mr. Bennett's roots as he welcomed ''the 108th mayuh of the City of New York.''
 Before the speech, songs from the vast Sinatra repertory filled the school's auditorium -- great numbers like ''In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning'' and not-so-great ones like ''My Way,'' whose title sums up the basic philosophy of most New York mayors (only their version tends to be ''My Way or the Highway'').
 And, yes, inescapably, there was the shopworn ''New York, New York.'' Mr. Bloomberg's speechwriters didn't even try to aim higher than obvious references to the city as king of the hill, top of the heap, yada yada yada.
 There were a few bold passages, though. Perhaps none was more gutsy than the mayor's appeal to New Yorkers to ''face some very sobering facts about who is succeeding and who is not'' in this city. The ''not'' category was a specific reference to young black and Hispanic men.
 Most politicians dance around this sad reality, retreating into the safety of generalities about ''troubled youth.'' Not Mr. Bloomberg, not this time.
 HE proposed programs intended to rescue endangered black and Hispanic young men. Their poverty, unemployment and school dropout rates, he noted, are all vastly higher than those of whites and Asian-Americans. More must also be done to end a culture of gun worship, he said, a theme emphasized lately by some prominent African-Americans, including the Rev. Al Sharpton.
 ''If we're going to continue driving down crime, we must help more black and Hispanic youth reject guns and gangs,'' the mayor said. ''We must.''
 Other than to suggest efficiencies that might save a few million here or there, Mr. Bloomberg had little to say about his dominant headache of the moment: how to resolve a budget deficit of about $4 billion. Solutions were left for another day. Of course the budget will be balanced. By law, it has to be, no matter who is mayor. The question is how.
 That's where skill and determination will enter the picture, along with good fortune, perhaps in the form of surprisingly higher tax revenues. A Sinatra song played on Wednesday spoke to that matter. It was ''Luck Be a Lady.'' For city budget makers, luck may be as close as they will ever get to a miracle.

HEADLINE: Senator Aims to Keep E.P.A. From Limiting Emissions

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
In a direct challenge to the Environmental Protection Agency's authority, Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, introduced a resolution on Thursday to prevent the agency from taking any action to regulate carbon dioxide and other climate-altering gases. 
 Ms. Murkowski, joined by 35 Republicans and three conservative Democrats, proposed to use the Congressional Review Act to strip the agency of the power to limit emissions of greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. The Supreme Court gave the agency legal authority to regulate such emissions in a landmark 2007 ruling.
 The agency has declared carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to be a threat to human health and the environment and is moving to write regulations to restrict emissions from vehicles, power plants and other major sources. The action could impose significant costs on the economy but would also rein in production of the heat-trapping gases that most scientists link to worrisome changes in the global climate.
 ''Make no mistake,'' Ms. Murkowski said in a floor statement, ''if Congress allows this to happen there will be severe consequences.'' She said businesses would be forced to close or move overseas, domestic energy production would be curtailed, housing would become more expensive and agricultural costs would rise.
 Her resolution requires a majority vote in the Senate, a remote possibility because of the strong opposition of the Democratic leader, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, and most other Democrats. It faces even longer odds in the House. And then it would require the signature of President Obama, who is all but certain to veto it because it would rob him of a critical regulatory tool.
 Ms. Murkowski said that the Obama administration was using the threat of E.P.A. regulation to force Congress to move quickly on broad energy and climate-change legislation, including a complex cap-and-trade program to limit carbon-dioxide pollution.
 Ms. Murkowski, the senior Republican on the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, has nearly unanimous Republican support in addition to the backing of the three Democrats: Senators Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and Ben Nelson of Nebraska.
 Her effort was applauded by a broad swath of industry, agriculture and energy lobbies, which fear the prospect of what they consider capricious and heavy-handed regulation by the E.P.A.
 An aide to Mr. Reid said that the measure was unlikely to come to a vote before March because of a crowded legislative calendar. He also said that while Mr. Reid believes that legislation to address climate change is preferable to E.P.A. regulation, the agency must retain the authority to act if Congress does not.
 ''There is no disagreement that it would be better than E.P.A. regulation for Congress to pass bipartisan comprehensive clean energy and climate legislation that creates jobs, improves our energy security and invests in making our economy and businesses more efficient and globally competitive,'' the aide, Jim Manley, said. ''But, thus far, very few Republicans have shown any willingness to work with us to get that done.''

HEADLINE: Virginia Governor to Respond

BYLINE: By BERNIE BECKER

 BODY:
Robert F. McDonnell, the newly sworn-in governor of Virginia, will deliver the Republican response to President Obama's first State of the Union address Wednesday. 
 Mr. McDonnell was a Republican star in 2009, as the party bounced back to capture the governors' mansions in both Virginia and New Jersey after disastrous elections in 2006 and 2008. He was sworn in on Saturday.
 The top Republicans in the Senate and the House -- Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio -- announced the choice of Mr. McDonnell on Thursday, complimenting the governor as someone who backs common-sense economic policies. 
 ''Governor McDonnell understands that the American people are more interested in shrinking unemployment than expanding government,'' Senator McConnell said. BERNIE BECKER

The party's over for Naomi Brilliant. The social butterfly whose rock 'n' roll events at Roshambo, her Sonoma winery, attracted droves of San Francisco hipsters -- typically in silly costumes -- is plowing under the vines she inherited from her grandfather to grow vegetables. She's sold the last of her Roshambo wine. 
 After 10 years in overdrive trying to convince her generation that wine is a blast, ''I realized I wasn't having any fun doing this any more,'' Ms. Brilliant, 37, said in an interview. 
It's a head-snapping move for the saucy, tattooed hostess who last June drew 700 fans to her tasting room in the Carneros region of Sonoma for her annual Rock-Paper-Scissors Tournament, the most famous of Roshambo's attempts to reach beyond the confines of the traditional wine industry.
 In part she's a victim of the recession that's threatening dozens of small wineries. 
 The profits at Roshambo (a name for the children's game rock-paper-scissors) evaporated as sales dwindled from a high of 10,000 cases in 2005. Last year, Ms. Brilliant reduced production to 1,000 cases and decided to make no wine during the 2009 harvest, selling all the grapes.
 But her biggest problem was that Roshambo wines never found their market. For the sort of folks who attended her events, the wines were expensive, $15 to $30. And she never positioned them as anything other than party quaffers. 
 ''I was never a huge fan of the wines,'' said Russel Thompson, a San Francisco salon owner who was one of her regulars. ''But we were fans of the culture.''
 Alder Yarrow, who writes the wine blog Vinography, called Roshambo wines ''decent, nothing special.'' (Others thought more highly of them.) But, he said, Ms. Brilliant was a barrier-breaker. Wearing a miniskirt and a feather boa at wine industry events, she made up for all of the business's stodginess.
 ''In an industry that takes itself too seriously,'' he said, ''she was a breath of fresh air.''
 As she puts it: ''I am an artist. My art is to bring people together.'' While she enjoyed the grand gesture -- flying performers in from New York City for her Drag Queen Brunch -- she made Roshambo the highlight of Sonoma County wine events by cranking up the live music and encouraging her friends to forgo the sober sipping and spitting and simply drink her wine. 
 ''We had a lot of success getting people to dress up,'' she said. ''I always tried to be fabulous.''
 Ms. Brilliant, who grew up in Chico, Calif., spent summers with her father's parents at their Sonoma vineyard. Her grandfather, Frank Johnson, bought the vineyard in 1971, a year after selling his orthodontics company. He died in 1993; after his wife died in 1997, Ms. Brilliant was left with an inheritance and the vineyard.
 ''My grandfather always wanted to have a winery,'' she said, and she set out to realize his dream in her own way. 
 ''I wanted to rock the wine world,'' she said.
 She opened an eye-popping modern winery in 2001 designed as much as an art gallery and performance space as a practical winemaking facility. 
 Her events were packed. ''Everyone was always in costume, sort of a punk, '80s rock thing,'' said Kendall Johnson, a publicist who was 24 when she started going to the events, in 2006. ''It was where everyone ended up after a day of winery visits.''
 But when the parties ended, Ms. Brilliant faced the day-to-day operations of a winery she described as a financial drain. 
 Her business plan? There wasn't one. The Roshambo events, where tickets typically sold for a modest $10 to $15, lost money. She rationalized the expense as long as the wines were selling. ''If all of the people who say they love my wine and support me would have bought my wine,'' she said, ''things would have been a lot easier.'' 
 By 2005, the cost of running the winery overwhelmed her and she sold the facility to Twomey Cellars. She took her party on the road in the Roshambus, an RV with party lights and the facilities to broadcast a radio show. In 2007, she leased a 1,200-square-foot tasting room in Carneros.
 She believed that her thumb-to-the-nose attitude would endear her to the industry, but she remained an outsider.
 Pitching her wines to retailers was like ''selling my soul,'' she said. ''There is always someone else who can make wine for less and offer it to stores at a lower price. It would have been insanity to keep lowering the price.''
 She said that big corporations own many of the wineries that are perceived as family businesses, and control the means to distribute wine. ''They make it very difficult for the real start-ups,'' she said.
 A recently planted one-acre garden on her Westside Road property is her first step toward her next incarnation, as a full-time organic farmer. She has uprooted 40 acres of vines and plans to pull up at least another 10 acres of vines this year.
 Her ''future sanity,'' she says, will come from digging in the dirt, thinking about the seasons and learning the process of growing food. ''What I want to do with my life is to share things,'' she said. ''It was through wine. Now it is through my vegetables.''

HEADLINE: Trains to Silicon Valley Get an Old-Fashioned Send-Off

BYLINE: By SCOTT JAMES. 
Scott James is an Emmy-winning television journalist and novelist who lives in San Francisco.

 BODY:
The Bay Area might be the envy of the world for its technological prowess, but when it comes to the railroad that serves Silicon Valley, it all comes down to an unprepossessing piece of wood and a long stick.
 That is the primitive communication system at the Caltrain terminus at Fourth and Townsend Streets in San Francisco. No flat screens. No clickety-clack flap display. Not even an electronic readout that would have been state of the art in 1981. Passengers who want to know where and when a train departs rely on technology from a Restoration comedy.
Station workers use the stick to lift into place wooden ''dog bone'' boards denoting departure times above entrances to the 12 tracks. Then they unlock glass cabinet doors and use their hands to change the boards listing the stops. 
 It is an anachronistic ritual in what is otherwise a temple to modernity. Tickets are sold at computerized kiosks, and gleaming glass windows reach up two stories. The station won a design award from the American Institute of Architects in 2001.
 The building's architect, Eli Naor of VBN Architects in Oakland, said the labor-intensive signs were required as part of the design. ''No one wanted to invest in an electronic system,'' Mr. Naor said.
 Christine Dunn, a spokeswoman for Caltrain, said the setup was ''a reminder of the station's historic past.'' Ms. Dunn said old signs were brought over from the previous station at Third and Townsend to make riders feel comfortable. She also said Amtrak, which operates stations and trains for Caltrain, insisted on it.
 Caltrain increased ticket prices in recent years, and the decision to avoid automation comes with a cost. To cover all sign-changing shifts year-round requires a staff of three. 
 Both Caltrain and Amtrak declined to say how much those workers were paid, or if union rules required those jobs. Renee Graham, an Amtrak spokeswoman, said the agency was a contractor and considered the information private. Ms. Dunn said Caltrain did not have access to Amtrak's personnel costs.
 SimplyHired.com, a Web site that aggregates salary information to estimate how much people make, put the average yearly pay for an Amtrak employee in San Francisco at $79,000. With Social Security and benefits Amtrak describes as ''competitive,'' the cost of each sign worker approaches $100,000 per year, assuming they are average workers. Over the course of a decade, the personnel costs for changing signs by hand might reach an estimated $3 million.
 Ms. Dunn bristled at such analysis. ''That's not correct,'' she said, adding that the sign crew also had other duties, including running the lost and found.
 Even though the station has security officers, the sign crew also locks the doors to the tracks to protect passengers from moving trains. Such precautions are not taken at other Caltrain stations. Ms. Dunn said the effort was warranted by the number of tracks in San Francisco. 
 ''There's a lot of tradition and hubris in the way we operate trains in this country,'' said Michael Kiesling, a transportation expert who just stepped down after years on the Citizens Advisory Committee of the Peninsula Corridor Joint Powers Board, the agency that manages Caltrain. ''There's a lot of stuff we need to get rid of.''
 Ms. Dunn said a plan to change to digital signs was being considered for 2011. Preliminary estimates put the cost at $900,000, although with the economic downturn there is no money for it yet.
 And while digital signs are standard and reliable at railways around the world, getting them to work reliably in the Bay Area has been a problem. Riders of San Francisco's Muni subway know the information screens in stations under Market Street often contain more fiction than the best-seller list. Digital displays along Amtrak's Capital Corridor service to Sacramento have encountered ''occasional blips,'' Ms. Graham said.
 A piece of wood and stick, by comparison, are solidly reliable. But at the world's tech crossroads they seem outmoded in ''the city that knows how.''
 Why keep such a tradition in the 21st century? Mr. Naor considered, then said, ''Why do they still have the changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace?''

HEADLINE: To Heal Haiti, Look to History, Not Nature

BYLINE: By MARK DANNER. 
Mark Danner is the author, most recently, of ''Stripping Bare the Body: Politics, Violence, War,'' which chronicles political conflict in Haiti, the Balkans, Iraq and the United States.

 BODY:
HAITI is everybody's cherished tragedy. Long before the great earthquake struck the country like a vengeful god, the outside world, and Americans especially, described, defined, marked Haiti most of all by its suffering. Epithets of misery clatter after its name like a ball and chain: Poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. One of the poorest on earth. For decades Haiti's formidable immiseration has made it among outsiders an object of fascination, wonder and awe. Sometimes the pity that is attached to the land -- and we see this increasingly in the news coverage this past week -- attains a tone almost sacred, as if Haiti has taken its place as a kind of sacrificial victim among nations, nailed in its bloody suffering to the cross of unending destitution. 
 And yet there is nothing mystical in Haiti's pain, no inescapable curse that haunts the land. From independence and before, Haiti's harms have been caused by men, not demons. Act of nature that it was, the earthquake last week was able to kill so many because of the corruption and weakness of the Haitian state, a state built for predation and plunder. Recovery can come only with vital, even heroic, outside help; but such help, no matter how inspiring the generosity it embodies, will do little to restore Haiti unless it addresses, as countless prior interventions built on transports of sympathy have not, the man-made causes that lie beneath the Haitian malady.
 In 1804 the free Republic of Haiti was declared in almost unimaginable triumph: hard to exaggerate the glory of that birth. Hundreds of thousands of enslaved Africans had labored to make Saint-Domingue, as Haiti was then known, the richest colony on earth, a vastly productive slave-powered factory producing tons upon tons of sugar cane, the 18th-century's great cash crop. For pre-Revolutionary France, Haiti was an inexhaustible cash cow, floating much of its economy. Generation after generation, the second sons of the great French families took ship for Saint-Domingue to preside over the sugar plantations, enjoy the favors of enslaved African women and make their fortunes. 
 Even by the standards of the day, conditions in Saint-Domingue's cane fields were grisly and brutal; slaves died young, and in droves; they had few children. As exports of sugar and coffee boomed, imports of fresh Africans boomed with them. So by the time the slaves launched their great revolt in 1791, most of those half-million blacks had been born in Africa, spoke African languages, worshipped African gods. 
 In an immensely complex decade-long conflict, these African slave-soldiers, commanded by legendary leaders like Toussaint Louverture and Jean-Jacques Dessalines, defeated three Western armies, including the unstoppable superpower of the day, Napoleonic France. In an increasingly savage war -- ''Burn houses! Cut off heads!'' was the slogan of Dessalines -- the slaves murdered their white masters, or drove them from the land. 
 On Jan. 1, 1804, when Dessalines created the Haitian flag by tearing the white middle from the French tricolor, he achieved what even Spartacus could not: he had led to triumph the only successful slave revolt in history. Haiti became the world's first independent black republic and the second independent nation in the Western Hemisphere.
 Alas, the first such republic, the United States, despite its revolutionary creed that ''all men are created equal,'' looked upon these self-freed men with shock, contempt and fear. Indeed, to all the great Western trading powers of the day -- much of whose wealth was built on the labor of enslaved Africans -- Haiti stood as a frightful example of freedom carried too far. American slaveholders desperately feared that Haiti's fires of revolt would overleap those few hundred miles of sea and inflame their own human chattel. 
 For this reason, the United States refused for nearly six decades even to recognize Haiti. (Abraham Lincoln finally did so in 1862.) Along with the great colonial powers, America instead rewarded Haiti's triumphant slaves with a suffocating trade embargo -- and a demand that in exchange for peace the fledgling country pay enormous reparations to its former colonial overseer. Having won their freedom by force of arms, Haiti's former slaves would be made to purchase it with treasure.
 The new nation, its fields burned, its plantation manors pillaged, its towns devastated by apocalyptic war, was crushed by the burden of these astronomical reparations, payments that, in one form or another, strangled its economy for more than a century. It was in this dark aftermath of war, in the shadow of isolation and contempt, that Haiti's peculiar political system took shape, mirroring in distorted form, like a wax model placed too close to the fire, the slave society of colonial times. 
 At its apex, the white colonists were supplanted by a new ruling class, made up largely of black and mulatto officers. Though these groups soon became bitter political rivals, they were as one in their determination to maintain in independent Haiti the cardinal principle of governance inherited from Saint-Domingue: the brutal predatory extraction of the country's wealth by a chosen powerful few.
 The whites on their plantations had done this directly, exploiting the land they owned with the forced labor of their slaves. But the slaves had become soldiers in a victorious revolution, and those who survived demanded as their reward a part of the rich land on which they had labored and suffered. Soon after independence most of the great plantations were broken up, given over to the former slaves, establishing Haiti as a nation of small landowners, one whose isolated countryside remained, in language, religion and culture, largely African. 
 Unable to replace the whites in their plantation manors, Haiti's new elite moved from owning the land to fighting to control the one institution that could tax its products: the government. While the freed slaves worked their small fields, the powerful drew off the fruits of their labor through taxes. In this disfigured form the colonial philosophy endured: ruling had to do not with building or developing the country but with extracting its wealth. ''Pluck the chicken,'' proclaimed Dessalines -- now Emperor Jacques I -- ''but don't make it scream.''
 In 1806, two years after independence, the emperor was bayoneted by a mostly mulatto cabal of officers. Haitian history became the immensely complex tale of factional struggles to control the state, with factions often defined by an intricate politics of skin color. There was no method of succession ultimately recognized as legitimate, no tradition of loyal opposition. Politics was murderous, operatic, improvisational. Instability alternated with autocracy. The state was battled over and won; Haiti's wealth, once seized, purchased allegiance -- but only for a time. Fragility of rule and uncertainty of tenure multiplied the imperative to plunder. Unseated rulers were sometimes killed, more often exiled, but always their wealth -- that part of it not sent out of the country -- was pillaged in its turn. 
 In 1915 the whites returned: the United States Marines disembarked to enforce continued repayment of the original debt and to put an end to an especially violent struggle for power that, in the shadow of World War I and German machinations in the Caribbean, suddenly seemed to threaten American interests. During their nearly two decades of rule, the Americans built roads and bridges, centralized the Haitian state -- setting the stage for the vast conurbation of greater Port-au-Prince that we see today in all its devastation -- and sent Haitians abroad to be educated as agronomists and doctors in the hope of building a more stable middle class. 
 Still, by the time they finally left, little in the original system had fundamentally changed. Haitian nationalism, piqued by the reappearance of white masters who had forced Haitians to work in road gangs, produced the noiriste movement that finally brought to power in 1957 Francois Duvalier, the most brilliant and bloody of Haiti's dictators, who murdered tens of thousands while playing adroitly on cold-war America's fear of communism to win American acceptance. 
 Duvalier's epoch, which ended with the overthrow of his son Jean-Claude in 1986, ushered in Haiti's latest era of instability, which has seen, in barely a quarter-century, several coups and revolutions, a handful of elections (aborted, rigged and, occasionally, fair), a second American occupation (whose accomplishments were even more ephemeral than the first) and, all told, a dozen Haitian rulers. Less and less money now comes from the land, for Haiti's topsoil has grown enfeebled from overproduction and lack of investment. Aid from foreigners, nations or private organizations, has largely supplanted it: under the Duvaliers Haiti became the great petri dish of foreign aid. A handful of projects have done lasting good; many have been self-serving and even counterproductive. All have helped make it possible, by lifting basic burdens of governance from Haiti's powerful, for the predatory state to endure. 
 The struggle for power has not ended. Nor has Haiti's historic proclivity for drama and disaster. Undertaken in their wake, the world's interventions -- military and civilian, and accompanied as often as not by a grand missionary determination to ''rebuild Haiti'' -- have had as their single unitary principle their failure to alter what is most basic in the country, the reality of a corrupt state and the role, inadvertent or not, of outsiders in collaborating with it. 
 The sound of Haiti's suffering is deafening now but behind it one can hear already a familiar music begin to play. Haiti must be made new. This kind of suffering so close to American shores cannot be countenanced. The other evening I watched a television correspondent shake his head over what he movingly described as a ''stupid death'' -- a death that, but for the right medical care, could have been prevented. ''It doesn't have to happen,'' he told viewers. ''People died today who did not need to die.'' He did not say what any Haitian could have told him: that the day before, and the day before that, Haiti had seen hundreds of such ''stupid deaths,'' and, over the centuries, thousands more. What has changed, once again, and only for a time, is the light shone on them, and the volume of the voices demanding that a ''new Haiti'' must now be built so they never happen again.
 Whether they can read or not, Haiti's people walk in history, and live in politics. They are independent, proud, fiercely aware of their own singularity. What distinguishes them is a tradition of heroism and a conviction that they are and will remain something distinct, apart -- something you can hear in the Creole spoken in the countryside, or the voodoo practiced there, traces of the Africa that the first generation of revolutionaries brought with them on the middle passage.
 Haitians have grown up in a certain kind of struggle for individuality and for power, and the country has proved itself able to absorb the ardent attentions of outsiders who, as often as not, remain blissfully unaware of their own contributions to what Haiti is. Like the ruined bridges strewn across the countryside -- one of the few traces of the Marines and their occupation nearly a century ago -- these attentions tend to begin in evangelical zeal and to leave little lasting behind.
 What might, then? America could start by throwing open its markets to Haitian agricultural produce and manufactured goods, broadening and making permanent the provisions of a promising trade bill negotiated in 2008. Such a step would not be glamorous; it would not ''remake Haiti.'' But it would require a lasting commitment by American farmers and manufacturers and, as the country heals, it would actually bring permanent jobs, investment and income to Haiti. 
 Second, the United States and other donors could make a formal undertaking to ensure that the vast amounts that will soon pour into the country for reconstruction go not to foreigners but to Haitians -- and not only to Haitian contractors and builders but to Haitian workers, at reasonable wages. This would put real money in the hands of many Haitians, not just a few, and begin to shift power away from both the rapacious government and the well-meaning and too often ineffectual charities that seek to circumvent it. The world's greatest gift would be to make it possible, and necessary, for Haitians -- all Haitians -- to rebuild Haiti.
 Putting money in people's hands will not make Haiti's predatory state disappear. But in time, with rising incomes and a concomitant decentralization of power, it might evolve. In coming days much grander ambitions are sure to be declared, just as more scenes of disaster and disorder will transfix us, more stunning and colorful images of irresistible calamity. We will see if the present catastrophe, on a scale that dwarfs all that have come before, can do anything truly to alter the reality of Haiti.

HEADLINE: If Bills Fail, A Quandary For Insurers

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON

 BODY:
With the possible collapse of the Congressional health care effort, health insurers might seem to have reason to celebrate. The legislation threatened to remake much of their business, with the prospect of burdensome government regulation and less profit from selling coverage to individuals and small businesses. 
 Indeed, some insurance stocks initially rose on expectations that the Massachusetts Senate vote might have derailed the Democrats' health overhaul. But more of the same might not actually be such good news for insurers, some health policy experts and Wall Street analysts say. 
 ''In the longer term, reform would have been better for them,'' said Les Funtleyder, the health care strategist for Miller Tabak & Company, a New York investment firm. He acknowledged that insurance stocks might benefit in the short run as investors expressed their relief over the diminishing odds of a health care bill. 
 The health care legislation under construction in Congress would force the insurers to conduct business very differently, but the companies had already agreed to some of the most fundamental changes. One was their pledge to offer coverage to everyone, regardless of medical status, if the government could ensure that people, even the young and healthy, would have to sign up. 
 In return, Mr. Funtleyder noted, Congress was potentially delivering as many as 30 million new customers to the insurance market -- many of whom would be able to afford coverage because the government would subsidize the cost of premiums. 
 ''That's real revenue, even for Wall Street,'' he said. 
 But now, in the possible absence of forced change to their business, the insurers still face the daunting challenge of selling a product that is increasingly out of reach for more Americans as the cost of medical care -- and thus premiums -- continues to climb. 
 Moreover, the industry's main business of selling coverage through employers has largely stalled, while the weak economy has speeded the loss of customers as people lose their jobs and their health insurance. 
 ''People are still being crowded out of the market because they can't afford it,'' said Sheryl R. Skolnick, a health care analyst for Pali Capital in New York.
 If the health overhaul is indeed dead, she said, the critical question becomes ''how do you grow these businesses?''
 The insurers say they understand the need for change in their business, particularly so they can offer more affordable coverage to people who must buy insurance on their own and are in poor health. 
 ''There are legitimate, real issues that aren't going away that we need to address,'' said Ronald A. Williams, the chief executive of Aetna, one of the big for-profit insurers. 
 But Mr. Williams expressed frustration that the effort so far in Washington had been focused on how to overhaul the insurance market, rather than looking at ways of improving the health care system as a whole -- so as to deliver better care at lower prices. ''We have to get at the factors that are driving health care costs,'' he said. 
 Despite its often vociferous opposition to specific elements of the bill, the insurance industry says it is still in favor of many of the changes it embraced well before the current health care bill began to evolve. 
 ''We strongly support reform,'' said Robert Zirkelbach, a spokesman for America's Health Insurance Plans, the industry trade group. ''We do believe there are reforms that can be done that produce greater health security and more affordable coverage to the American people.''
 Industry analysts say insurers may end up having to adopt some of the changes that the legislation envisions, either on their own or as state regulators demand changes. To be sure, not everyone agrees that the health care legislation would be worse for the industry than the current situation. Some analysts say it is unclear how many of the tens of millions of people without coverage would have actually become customers under the legislation, given the weak federal financial penalties if they did not enroll and questions over how generous the government subsidies would eventually be. 
 Many analysts also predicted that insurers would have sharply lower profits under the legislation, which would restrict how much more they could charge to cover older, sicker people. 
 One concern of insurers and others was that the legislation would simply expand coverage without addressing the other fundamental problems of the health care system and make the problem of rising costs even worse. 
 If coverage were expanded without cost controls, it would only ''accelerate a crisis that people already knew was coming,'' said Michael A. Turpin, a former insurance company executive who is now a senior executive at USI Holdings, an insurance brokerage.
 Policy analysts say many insurers realize that even without legislation they might have no choice but to try to come up with more successful ways to keep costs under control and, therefore, be able to offer coverage that remains affordable. 
 ''I think these companies are going to be very aggressive,'' said Paul H. Keckley, the executive director for the Deloitte Center for Health Solutions, a research arm of the consulting firm Deloitte. 
 But without the aid of the government through some provisions of the legislation, some policy analysts say the insurers might be hard pressed to rein in the fees charged by hospitals and doctors. 
 ''They've lost all the leverage reform would have given them,'' said Len Nichols, a health care economist for the New America Foundation, a policy research organization that supports an overhaul. 
 And the insurers say they know they cannot fix many of the problems in the health care system without the support of the government. ''This should be a public-private partnership to achieve the type of reform people are looking for,'' said Mr. Zirkelbach of the insurance trade association. 
 For insurers, the largest risk may be that without a government-led overhaul, their industry faces an even bleaker future should medical costs and premiums continue to soar, perhaps eventually prompting draconian changes from the government. 
 By the time Congress dares to try again to overhaul health care, some analysts predict, the problems with the system might be so acute that Washington might regulate the insurers more heavily than has been considered for the current legislation -- or flirt even more with the idea of the federal government becoming directly involved in providing insurance.
 ''It's going to come back to the forefront again,'' predicted Matthew Borsch, an analyst at Goldman Sachs who follows the industry and says the insurers face an increasingly daunting environment. ''When it comes back to the forefront, is it going to be an even scarier proposition?''

HEADLINE: Wal-Mart Struggles to Expand in City

BYLINE: By DAN MIHALOPOULOS and KATIE FRETLAND

 BODY:
In the room behind the City Council chambers during the Jan. 13 meeting, a high-ranking Wal-Mart official asked Mayor Richard M. Daley if he was committed to the company's plans to expand beyond its only store in Chicago. 
 Mr. Daley replied with a curt profanity and walked away, according to a source who witnessed the exchange but did not want to be identified for fear of angering the mayor.
The mayor's response at that meeting revealed his frustration over a rare instance in which he has been unable to get the council to support his position. Although Mr. Daley has voiced support for more Wal-Mart stores in the city for years, the world's largest retailer is still unable to break ground on more outlets. 
 Before walking out of the back room encounter with Rolando Rodriguez, Wal-Mart's regional general manager for Illinois and northern Indiana, Mr. Daley urged the company to do a better job of swaying public opinion, the source who witnessed the conversation said. 
 Citing the recession and the need to create jobs, Mr. Daley in recent months has encouraged Wal-Mart to make another push for the city's approval. But those efforts have stalled, with neither the mayor nor a majority of aldermen willing to expend the political capital to overcome organized labor's opposition to nonunion Wal-Mart. 
 While Wal-Mart's allies say new stores could help combat high unemployment, critics want the company to promise higher wages and health insurance for all workers. They also say the retailer's arrival swamps competitors, destroying as many jobs as it creates.
 Wal-Mart officials are so confounded by their lack of success in Chicago that they plan to bus people from inner-city neighborhoods to shop at their stores outside the city, said Alderman Anthony Beale and other council members who want the company to build stores in their wards. 
 Mr. Beale is pushing to win over reluctant aldermen to Wal-Mart's side. ''We are losing billions of dollars a year to suburban area stores,'' said the alderman, who hopes to have a Wal-Mart as part of a 270-acre development in his Ninth Ward on the Far South Side. ''How do you in good conscience vote against any type of job in this economy?''
 Wal-Mart's store in the Austin neighborhood on the West Side employs 430 people, said John Bisio, a company spokesman. Mr. Bisio also said the store inspired other new retail outlets in the neighborhood since it opened in September 2006. 
 Efforts to broker a deal for a new store in the Chatham neighborhood failed again on Jan. 11. The council had rejected the Chatham plan in 2004 at the same time that aldermen approved the West Side Wal-Mart.
 Almost six years later, the issue remains divisive, especially in the predominantly black neighborhoods where Wal-Mart wants to open five Supercenters that sell groceries as well as other retail items. 
 Mr. Daley could merely instruct his top planning aide to sign off on the new Wal-Mart in Chatham, but he has balked at doing so. ''We're leaving it up to the aldermen,'' Jacquelyn Heard, the mayor's spokeswoman, said this week. 
 For Mr. Daley, allies say, forcing the issue would feed criticism that he rules Chicago like a monarch. But he has unapologetically decided other controversial issues by fiat -- for instance, he ordered the midnight bulldozing of runways at Meigs Field in 2003. 
 By deferring to the aldermen, Mr. Daley also avoids a direct confrontation with the unions. They did not support his re-election bid in 2007 and spent millions of dollars to help unseat several of his council allies in that election. 
 With another election a year away, many aldermen are also not eager to make themselves targets of the unions. In the 2007 election, labor's financing and manpower for council challengers dwarfed the support provided by the mayor and pro-business groups for their allies. 
 More than a dozen black churches and labor unions countered Wal-Mart's newest lobbying effort by creating a group called Good Jobs Chicago. The organization has placed advertisements on billboards in the 9th and 21st Wards demanding that large retailers provide ''living wages'' and ''affordable health care.'' 
 The racially charged nature of the issue was evident at an event on Monday to celebrate the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday. Speakers at the rally in Hyde Park noted that Dr. King was killed while fighting for workers' rights and derided Wal-Mart's unwillingness to negotiate with its critics, according to a news release from Good Jobs Chicago. 
 ''You should have seen them wheeling and dealing to build five plantations in Chicago,'' the Rev. Booker Vance said in the release. 
 Besides promising more jobs, Wal-Mart officials said their Supercenters would address the problem of ''food deserts'' -- neighborhoods without places to buy fresh fruit and vegetables. 
 Pat Dowell, an alderman in the Third Ward, was first elected in 2007 with union support and said she would prefer a Roundy's grocery store at 39th and State Streets over a Wal-Mart. 
 ''I'm going to address the issue of the food desert by bringing in a company that is responsible,'' she said, noting that Roundy's is a union employer. 
 But some aldermen said the economy had become so bad that they should re-consider their opposition to Wal-Mart. 
 Alderman Sandi Jackson of the Seventh Ward, who was once a Wal-Mart critic, said this week that she had recently switched sides. In 2007, she campaigned with union support and said she backed an ordinance requiring ''big box'' retailers to pay higher wages and offer benefits. Mr. Daley had used his veto power for the only time in his 21-year tenure to defeat that ordinance in 2006, setting off the election battle with the unions. 
 ''I still believe paying a decent wage is appropriate, but now is not the time to be taking action that would keep out the jobs that five Supercenters would bring,'' Mrs. Jackson told the Chicago News Cooperative this week. ''Not one person has told me to vote against Wal-Mart coming into Chatham, the 9th Ward, the 34th Ward or any of the other food deserts in the city.'' 
 She predicted that thousands of people would line up for a shot at one of approximately 400 jobs available at any new Wal-Mart. 
 ''People are willing to take any job,'' she said. ''To get money to put food on the table is more important than dickering over a dollar here or there.'' 
 The alderman is the wife of Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr., Democrat of Illinois, and the daughter-in-law of the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who loudly criticized Wal-Mart when it first tried to enter the Chicago market. Alderman Jackson said she had not discussed the issue with her father-in-law; he did not return calls seeking comment. 
 Even some union leaders seem weary of the battle and reluctant to engage in another confrontation with the mayor. ''We're in a different time,'' said Dennis Gannon, president of the Chicago Federation of Labor. ''There should be some resolution so we can move ahead as a city. We don't want to go through what we went through. We really kind of divided the city.'' 
 But Mr. Gannon expressed frustration at Wal-Mart's unwillingness to sit down with labor leaders to come to a compromise. 
 Ms. Heard, the mayor's spokeswoman, and Mr. Bisio, the Wal-Mart spokesman, declined to comment when they were asked about Mr. Daley's abrupt termination of his discussion with Mr. Rodriguez. 
 ''Our passion and conviction to better serve Chicago customers has not diminished,'' Mr. Bisio said. ''We remain hopeful.''

HEADLINE: How to Deal With China

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Your Jan. 12 editorial ''It Isn't Working for Anyone Else'' about China's currency manipulation shows that conventional free trade theory has little in common with the realities of today's international trade. 
 The orthodoxy simply cannot account for or suggest responses to sustained outlier behavior. Even Alan Greenspan has recanted the theory that markets are self-correcting, but free trade theorists have not, putting themselves in an intellectual and policy bind.
 They use the term ''protectionist'' to describe any common-sense effort to deal with Chinese market-distorting policies: forced technology transfer, intellectual property theft, lavish government subsidies, value-added-tax export rebates, tax holidays, dumping and so on, in addition to currency manipulation.
 The financial imbalances created as a result of China's actions are at the root of the current recession, as American production and wealth-creating ability have become victims of Beijing's policies. The Times urges China to police itself. But what didn't work on Wall Street won't work in Beijing.
 Trade theory encompassing reality and new responses to China are urgently needed.

HEADLINE: Do The Right Thing

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
A message to House Democrats: This is your moment of truth. You can do the right thing and pass the Senate health care bill. Or you can look for an easy way out, make excuses and fail the test of history. 
 Tuesday's Republican victory in the Massachusetts special election means that Democrats can't send a modified health care bill back to the Senate. That's a shame because the bill that would have emerged from House-Senate negotiations would have been better than the bill the Senate has already passed. But the Senate bill is much, much better than nothing. And all that has to happen to make it law is for the House to pass the same bill, and send it to President Obama's desk. 
 Right now, Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, says that she doesn't have the votes to pass the Senate bill. But there is no good alternative.
 Some are urging Democrats to scale back their proposals in the hope of gaining Republican support. But anyone who thinks that would work must have spent the past year living on another planet. 
 The fact is that the Senate bill is a centrist document, which moderate Republicans should find entirely acceptable. In fact, it's very similar to the plan Mitt Romney introduced in Massachusetts just a few years ago. Yet it has faced lock-step opposition from the G.O.P., which is determined to prevent Democrats from achieving any successes. Why would this change now that Republicans think they're on a roll?
 Alternatively, some call for breaking the health care plan into pieces so that the Senate can vote the popular pieces into law. But anyone who thinks that would work hasn't paid attention to the actual policy issues. 
 Think of health care reform as being like a three-legged stool. You would, rightly, ridicule anyone who proposed saving money by leaving off one or two of the legs. Well, those who propose doing only the popular pieces of health care reform deserve the same kind of ridicule. Reform won't work unless all the essential pieces are in place. 
 Suppose, for example, that Congress took the advice of those who want to ban insurance discrimination on the basis of medical history, and stopped there. What would happen next? The answer, as any health care economist will tell you, is that if Congress didn't simultaneously require that healthy people buy insurance, there would be a ''death spiral'': healthier Americans would choose not to buy insurance, leading to high premiums for those who remain, driving out more people, and so on.
 And if Congress tried to avoid the death spiral by requiring that healthy Americans buy insurance, it would have to offer financial aid to lower-income families to make that insurance affordable -- aid at least as generous as that in the Senate bill. There just isn't any way to do reform on a smaller scale.
 So reaching out to Republicans won't work, and neither will trying to pass only the crowd-pleasing pieces of reform. What about the suggestion that Democrats use reconciliation -- the Senate procedure for finalizing budget legislation, which bypasses the filibuster -- to enact health reform? 
 That's a real option, which may become necessary (and could be used to improve the Senate bill after the fact). But reconciliation, which is basically limited to matters of taxing and spending, probably can't be used to enact many important aspects of reform. In fact, it's not even clear if it could be used to ban discrimination based on medical history. 
 Finally, some Democrats want to just give up on the whole thing.
 That would be an act of utter political folly. It wouldn't protect Democrats from charges that they voted for ''socialist'' health care -- remember, both houses of Congress have already passed reform. All it would do is solidify the public perception of Democrats as hapless and ineffectual.
 And anyway, politics is supposed to be about achieving something more than your own re-election. America desperately needs health care reform; it would be a betrayal of trust if Democrats fold simply because they hope (wrongly) that this would slightly reduce their losses in the midterm elections. 
 Now, part of Democrats' problem since Tuesday's special election has been that they have been waiting in vain for leadership from the White House, where Mr. Obama has conspicuously failed to rise to the occasion. 
 But members of Congress, who were sent to Washington to serve the public, don't have the right to hide behind the president's passivity.
 Bear in mind that the horrors of health insurance -- outrageous premiums, coverage denied to those who need it most and dropped when you actually get sick -- will get only worse if reform fails, and insurance companies know that they're off the hook. And voters will blame politicians who, when they had a chance to do something, made excuses instead.
 Ladies and gentlemen, the nation is waiting. Stop whining, and do what needs to be done.

HEADLINE: Basking In Islands Of Legalisms

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and economics in his blog at nytimes.com/norris.

DATELINE: The Cook Islands have a smaller population 

 BODY:
-- about 20,000 -- than one apartment complex in Manhattan, and an economy with little to offer except tourism and pearl exports. The country contracts out its national defense to New Zealand, which is four hours away by plane.
 But sand and sun are not the attractions for some Americans who have sent their money to the Cook Islands. 
 Under Cook Islands law, foreign court orders are generally disregarded, which is helpful for someone trying to keep assets away from creditors.
 In fact, getting an American court order can make it harder to get money out of the Cook Islands. If someone who stashed funds in a Cook Islands trust asks for the money back because a court ordered him to do so, Cook Islands law says that person is acting under duress, and the local trustee can refuse to return the money. 
 Over the years, a number of less-than-upstanding Americans have found the islands attractive for that reason, among them former corporate raiders, penny stock promoters and telemarketers who defrauded customers.
 The latest to use that tactic is the wife of Jamie L. Solow, a former broker in Florida who evidently has a silver tongue and certainly has a lot of angry former customers. In one year, he earned more than $3 million in commissions selling a form of collateralized debt obligations known as ''inverse floaters'' to individual investors who claim he never warned them of the risks.
 The investments proved to be disastrous, and the Securities and Exchange Commission persuaded a jury in West Palm Beach, Fla., that he had committed securities fraud. 
 Now a federal judge has ordered Mr. Solow to go to prison on Monday for civil contempt for failing to come up with a large part of the $6 million he was ordered to pay in disgorgement, interest and penalties.
 Mr. Solow claimed he had virtually no assets, since his wife owned everything in the family and had put most of it in a Cook Islands trust. A couple of months after the jury verdict, but before the final judgment was issued, she put an undisclosed amount of cash and jewelry in a safe deposit box in a Swiss bank in Zurich.
 Mr. Solow did sell all the assets he acknowledged owning -- an old pickup truck and some office furniture -- and sent $2,639 to the court. The family Rolls Royce was also sold, for $205,000, but the Solows say it was actually owned by Mrs. Solow, even though her husband had put up the money to buy it and signed the sale documents. 
 This week, Mr. Solow asked that his incarceration be delayed, on the grounds that he and his wife were now willing to ask the Cook Islands trustee to return the money. They have not actually made that request, and in the past, Cook Islands trustees have refused to honor such requests. In ordering Mr. Solow to prison, Judge Donald M. Middlebrooks, of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, said his inability to pay was self-created, and thus no excuse.
 Nor was the judge impressed by Mr. Solow's contention that the S.E.C. itself was to blame for his inability to pay, since it had won an order barring him from the securities industry, and thus prevented him from working.
 ''Mr. Solow's 'chosen profession' consisted of committing fraud against his investors,'' the judge wrote. ''That being the case, an opportunity to do different work, outside his 'chosen field,' may better serve his ability to satisfy the disgorgement order.''
 In setting up the trust, Mr. Solow's wife, Gina, followed a blueprint laid out in a 2005 article in an accounting publication, written by Howard D. Rosen, a lawyer in Florida whom she hired a few days after the jury verdict in early 2008.
 The Solows own a waterfront home in Hillsboro Beach, Fla., which they view as their permanent residence even though they have not lived in it for several years because of hurricane damage. ''It has been condemned due to the roof falling in,'' Mr. Solow's attorney, Carl F. Schoeppl, said Thursday, adding that he did not know how much repairs would cost.
 The house was already encumbered by $2.4 million in mortgages, but a Cook Islands bank lent $5.2 million more secured by the house. The money from that was immediately placed in a Cook Islands trust to benefit only Mrs. Solow. 
 The judge noted that the mortgage could not have been taken out without Mr. Solow's consent. 
 The house is now listed for sale for $6.1 million, far less than the combined mortgages, but the bank in the Cook Islands was taking no real risk. The proceeds from the mortgage were deposited in the Cook Islands, and the interest earned is used to pay the interest on the mortgage.
 Mrs. Solow also took out a $1.2 million mortgage on the Fort Lauderdale condominium she owns, and in which the couple live.
 Mr. Rosen, the lawyer who set up the trust, said in the article that it was a challenge to protect real estate from American courts, since the property obviously could not be moved overseas.
 ''The only effective method available to protect an immovable asset,'' he wrote, ''is to make the asset unattractive to a creditor by removing its value -- make the asset not worth going after. (Think about it: Would you spend your time and money to sue someone if all they had was a piece of real property worth $1 million encumbered by a $950,000 mortgage?) This technique is implemented by pledging the asset as collateral for a loan and by then protecting the loan proceeds with the client's other liquid assets in the offshore trust.''
 In a telephone interview, Mr. Rosen, who had testified in the case on behalf of Mr. Solow, told me that Judge Middlebrooks ''simply does not understand the laws of the United States'' and voiced confidence that an appeals court would overturn the ruling. 
 In an e-mail message, he compared the use of an offshore trust to a company's decision to incorporate in Delaware rather than some other state. ''Establishing a trust in the Cook Islands or other suitable asset protection jurisdiction in order to gain a protective advantage is no different,'' he wrote. ''It is a choice-of-law matter.''
 Of course, Delaware law does not say companies can ignore judgments issued by judges in other states.
 Even if Judge Middlebrooks's order is upheld on appeal, the S.E.C. could be in for a long battle to get the money. More than a decade ago, the Federal Trade Commission persuaded a federal court to jail a married couple, Michael and Denyse Anderson, for civil contempt after they violated a court order to return funds to the United States that had been put into a Cook Islands trust. The commission said the two were involved in a telemarketing Ponzi scheme.
 After several months, Mr. and Mrs. Anderson agreed to direct the trustee to release the money, and were released from jail. But the trustee refused, citing the United States court order as a form of duress, and the Cook Island courts upheld that decision.
 Eventually, the F.T.C. was able to recover most of the money, which went to a fund to repay victims of the fraud, because the trustee agreed to settle. That happened after the commission threatened to file contempt charges against ANZ, the Australian bank in which the Cook Islands bank had deposited the money. ANZ, which has offices in the United States, evidently persuaded the trustee to agree to a settlement.
 Promoters of Cook Island trusts learned from that case, and now make sure to use banks that have no American operations. It seems likely that a request from Mrs. Solow now would be similarly refused by the trustee.
 It is worth noting that nearly all of the asset-moving activities in this case came after the S.E.C. notified Mr. Solow that it intended to file suit, and many of them came after the jury rendered its verdict. Perhaps it could have been avoided if there had been an asset protection freeze in place.
 The S.E.C. says it has been seeking more such freezes. Mary L. Schapiro, the commission's chairwoman, said last week that the commission ''sought 82 asset freezes to preserve assets for the benefit of investors'' in fiscal year 2009, ''an increase of 78 percent compared to 46'' in the previous year.
 But it did not seek such an order in the Solow case, and probably would have had a difficult time getting one. It most often does so in insider trading cases, where it is preserving the apparently ill-gotten gains from being sent abroad, and in cases where it can persuade a judge that there is reason to fear the defendant would move assets and that it is highly likely the S.E.C. will win the case.
 The S.E.C. has now filed a follow-up case against Mrs. Solow, who was not a defendant in the original case, and is seeking to garnish any bank accounts she has. But the money is long gone.

HEADLINE: Swedish Bank Fee Sets Example for America

BYLINE: By MATTHEW SALTMARSH

 BODY:
When it comes to rescuing banks, the Swedes are earning a reputation as trendsetters. First they set a standard for recovering from disaster; now they want to export their idea for how to pay for it.
 The country went through its own crippling banking crisis during the early 1990s, after the bursting of a domestic credit bubble. It rebounded relatively smoothly through an aggressive bailout policy built around nationalization and carving the troubled assets of banks off into a so-called bad bank.
 That blueprint was followed to varying degrees over the last year or so in the United States, Japan, Britain, the Netherlands and other countries. 
 Now, others are looking at Sweden's latest idea to protect its lenders, enacted at the end of 2009 -- a ''stability fee,'' or direct tax on banks so that they pay for their own bailouts. 
 The Swedish idea appears to have resonated in Washington. United States Treasury officials phoned their Swedish counterparts in December, requesting details of the fee. Last week, the Obama administration announced plans for a financial crisis responsibility fee, aimed at its biggest banks and intended to complete the recovery of the cost to taxpayers of the American bank bailout program.
 ''We can so far be proud,'' the Swedish minister for financial markets, Mats Odell, said in a telephone interview from Stockholm. ''Our support so far is in profit; we avoided a crisis like the 1930s and we have a stable system to ensure that taxpayers will be protected in future crises.''
 The American proposal, which is expected to face a fierce fight in Congress, works along similar lines as the Swedish program, but has a different goal. The plan aims to recover for the taxpayer the billions in government funds spent bailing out giant lenders like Citigroup and Bank of America. 
 It would remain in place for at least 10 years and would be applied to all financial institutions with more than $50 billion in consolidated assets -- at 0.15 percent of covered liabilities. 
 Swedish officials say their program aims to ensure that when another banking crisis occurs, as it surely will, the tools are in place to manage and pay for it. 
 According to Swedish officials, the stability fee has been welcomed by the banks that dominate the financial system. Smaller credit and financing companies complained bitterly, though, arguing that they would never be helped by the government in the event of a failure. 
 In the United States, the reverse is happening. The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, representing Wall Street and big banks, is considering a lawsuit against the administration on the grounds that ''a tax so narrowly focused would penalize a specific group.'' Sweden did not suffer as much as some other countries during this financial crisis. The government, however, did guarantee that the major Swedish banks would not fail, and participated in a rights issue last year for Nordea Bank, in which it holds a 20 percent stake. It also took over Carnegie, a small investment bank.
 Two Swedish banks -- SEB and Swedbank -- ran into trouble from their aggressive expansion in the Baltic states of Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia. While the lenders were not bailed out, they benefited from state guarantees, avoiding damaging runs.
 But Stockholm went further, introducing a permanent stability fee on banks and other credit institutions that some now see as a model for other countries. 
 The levies are allocated to a stability fund, managed by the National Debt Office. The government plans to keep the tax until it hits a total of 2.5 percent of gross domestic product in 15 years. The Swedes estimate that to be the amount that a full-blown banking crisis would normally cost the economy.
 The fee will be due annually, starting at 0.018 percent of each institution's liabilities, excluding equity capital and some junior debt securities, based on audited balance sheets. 
 The first payments have not been made because the 2009 reports of the banks have not been completed. But the government has already started the fund with 15 billion kronor ($2.1 billion). Sweden has also parked its shares in Nordea, which have increased in value, in the fund; when conditions are right, Mr. Odell said, the government plans to sell its stake. The fund now stands at about 30 billion kronor, or about 1 percent of Swedish gross domestic product. The bank levy will rise to 0.036 percent of liabilities in 2011, when the government is planning to introduce a weighted charge as well. Companies with riskier balance sheets would pay more. 
 The money will initially be used by the agency in its own operations -- which potentially means the government could use it to pay down its debt. When the money is needed for bank support, the agency would raise money by issuing new debt securities. 
 Sweden has learned from some of the mistakes it made during the crisis of the 1990s. At that time, it introduced a levy on transactions, but trading activity then migrated to London, where taxes were more favorable, the Swedish finance minister, Anders Borg, said Tuesday at a meeting in Brussels.
 Having established and tested the new policies, Mr. Borg urged his European partners, in a letter released Tuesday, to follow his country's lead and introduce a similar program.
 Finance ministers from the Group of 20 world economic powers are scheduled to meet in February and are expected to discuss the issue. At the request of the G-20, the International Monetary Fund is working on proposals for a crisis levy and it plans to deliver a report to G-20 ministers in April. Leaders will examine the issue in June.

HEADLINE: A Skeptical Reception

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN and ERIC DASH; Sewell Chan reported from Washington, and Eric Dash from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama wants to cut down to size those too-big-to-fail banks. But his vow on Thursday to rewrite the rules of Wall Street left many questions unanswered, including the big one: Would this really prevent another financial crisis?
 The president's proposals to place new limits on the size and activities of big banks rattled the stock market, but banking executives were perplexed as to how his plan would work. Indeed, many insisted the proposals, if adopted, would do little to change their businesses. 
 Moreover, it was unclear if the twin proposals -- to ban banks with federally insured deposits from casting risky bets in the markets, and to resist further consolidation in the financial industry -- would have done much if anything to forestall the crisis that pushed the economic system to the brink of collapse in 2008.
 Mr. Obama appeared to be leaving crucial details to be hashed out by Congress, where partisan tussling has already threatened another reform the president supports -- the creation of a consumer protection agency that would have oversight over credit cards, mortgages and other lending products.
 Wall Street figures, many caught off guard by the news, reacted cautiously.
 ''I am somewhat skeptical about how much the federal government can actually regulate,'' said John C. Bogle, the founder of Vanguard, the mutual fund giant. ''We need to try, but all the lawyers and geniuses on Wall Street are going to figure out ways to get around everything.'' 
 Indeed, Mr. Obama acknowledged that ''an army of industry lobbyists'' had already descended on Capitol Hill, but vowed, ''If these folks want a fight, it's a fight I'm ready to have.''
 Shares of big banks -- potentially the biggest losers should the proposals be enacted -- fell sharply, dragging the broader market down by about 2 percent. Even as the markets stumbled, Mr. Obama -- still stinging from the Democrats' loss on Tuesday of the Massachusetts seat formerly held by Senator Edward M. Kennedy -- ramped up his populist approach, one week after he proposed a new tax on large financial institutions to recoup projected losses from the 2008 bailout. 
 Mr. Obama said the banks had nearly wrecked the economy by taking ''huge, reckless risks in pursuit of quick profits and massive bonuses.'' 
 The administration wants to ban bank holding companies from owning, investing in or sponsoring hedge funds or private equity funds and from engaging in proprietary trading, or trading on their own accounts, as opposed to the money of their customers.
 Mr. Obama called the ban the Volcker Rule, in recognition of the former Federal Reserve chairman, Paul A. Volcker, who has championed the proposal. Big losses by banks in the trading of financial securities, especially mortgage-backed assets, precipitated the credit crisis in 2008 and the federal bailout.
 It was not clear, however, how proprietary trading activities would be defined. 
 Officials said that banks would not be permitted to use their own capital for ''trading unrelated to serving customers.'' Such a restriction would most likely compel banks that own hedge funds and private equity funds to dispose of them over time. Officials said, however, that executing trades on a client's behalf and using bank capital to make a market or to hedge a client's risk would be permissible. 
 Federal regulators have already leaned hard on banks to curb pure proprietary trading, and the banks expect that regulators will demand more capital if they keep making risky bets, making the practice far less profitable. 
 Some of the biggest firms, applying a narrow definition, say that pure proprietary trading constituted less than 10 percent of their revenue, and in some cases far less. Morgan Stanley, for example, already abandoned all but two proprietary trading desks last year. 
 The Buckingham Research Group estimated that the new rules would reduce revenue at Citigroup, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase by less than 3 percent. Goldman Sachs, which typically derives a tenth of its revenue from such trading, said it would be able to contend with the new rules.
 ''I would say pure walled-off proprietary-trading businesses at Goldman Sachs are not very big in the context of the firm,'' David A. Viniar, the firm's chief financial officer, said in a conference call. 
 Mr. Obama also is seeking to limit consolidation in the financial sector, by placing curbs on the market share of liabilities at the largest firms. Since 1994, the share of insured deposits that can be held by any one bank has been capped at 10 percent. 
 The administration wants to expand that cap to include all liabilities, to limit the concentration of too much risk in any single bank. Officials said the measure would prevent banks at or near the threshold from making acquisitions but would not require them to shrink their business or stop growing on their own. 
 The Obama administration said the new proposals were in the ''spirit of Glass-Steagall'' -- a reference to the Depression-era law that separated commercial and investment banking, which was repealed in 1999. 
 Economists have debated whether the repeal of that act contributed to the crisis. The two big investment banks that imploded, Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, were not commercial banks, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley converted to bank holding companies only after the system started to come unglued.
 The industry was left buzzing with questions about timing and scope. Officials said the new restrictions would apply to overseas firms, like Barclays and UBS, with large American operations, but it was not clear how -- or whether -- foreign governments would go along. Officials also said the proposal called for a ''reasonable transition period'' for firms to comply with the rules, but the timetable was not specified. 
 Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, and Lawrence H. Summers, the president's chief economic adviser, developed the proposals at the request of the president and worked closely with Mr. Volcker, according to White House officials. The plan was completed over the holidays and submitted to the president with a unanimous recommendation from the economic team.
 While Mr. Geithner and Mr. Summers debated concerns that proprietary trading was not at the heart of the recent crisis, they concluded that reforms needed to address potential sources of risk in the future.
 Reaction on Capitol Hill also was muted, partly because neither party wanted to be seen as beholden to unpopular banks. The House bill passed last month would consolidate oversight, require stronger capital cushions for the largest banks and impose regulation of some derivatives. In many ways, the new White House proposal amplifies provisions in that bill that would have left regulators discretion over proprietary trading and excessive liability.

HEADLINE: Obama's Political Challenge

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 In ''What Didn't Happen'' (column, Jan. 18), Paul Krugman argues that President Obama's political problems do not stem from an overly ambitious agenda, but from wrong judgments on policy and politics. 
 I would point to President Obama's choice of warmed-over ''inside the Beltway'' triangulators as advisers who counseled him to be modest, nonconfrontational and compromising in his policies -- and thereby alienate his political base.
 We should have had a more vibrant stimulus package, a more progressive (and meaningful) health care proposal and far more pointed communication to the public to rebut the Republicans. Vice President Joe Biden should have been set loose to make the progressive case!
 I agree that President Obama needed to do what President Ronald Reagan did: continue his campaign into his presidency to argue more forcefully for the changes he promised during his campaign.
 Unless the message and tone out of this administration change very soon, we will have wasted a tremendous opportunity to move the country forward.
 James Ponsoldt Athens, Ga., Jan. 18, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Paul Krugman tells us that much of President Obama's trouble arises from his failure to spend adequate time blaming his predecessor, as he says President Ronald Reagan did.
 While it's true that the economy was in bad shape early in Mr. Reagan's presidency, people were instinctively supportive of his policies of lower taxes, less spending and smaller government, and were confident that these ideas would ultimately prove successful.
 President Obama's policies are the polar opposite: the government running car companies, vastly expanding its involvement in health care and spending money we clearly don't have. This instinctively makes people nervous.

HEADLINE: Clinton Makes Case for Internet Freedom as a Plank of American Foreign Policy

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER; Brian Knowlton contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Declaring that an attack on one nation's computer networks ''can be an attack on all,'' Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton issued a warning on Thursday that the United States would defend itself from cyberattacks, though she left unclear the means of response.
 In a sweeping, pointed address that dealt with the Internet as a force for both liberation and repression, Mrs. Clinton said: ''Those who disrupt the free flow of information in our society or any other pose a threat to our economy, our government and our civil society. Countries or individuals that engage in cyber-attacks should face consequences and international condemnation.'' 
 Her speech was the first in which a senior American official had articulated a vision for making Internet freedom a plank of American foreign policy. While the details remained sketchy, her remarks could have far-reaching consequences, given the confrontation between Google and the Chinese government over the company's assertion that its networks had been subject to a sophisticated attack that originated in mainland China.
 Mrs. Clinton called for China to investigate Google's accusation and be open about its findings. She said that the United States supported Google in publicly defying the Chinese government's requirement that it censor the contents of its Chinese-language search engine. 
 ''Censorship should not be in any way accepted by any company from anywhere,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''American companies need to take a principled stand. This needs to be part of our national brand.''
 This month Google announced that it was ''no longer willing to continue censoring'' search results for its Chinese users, pointing to breaches of Gmail accounts held by human rights activists in China. Several other companies had also been targets of hacking, the company found. Google has avoided placing direct blame on the government in Beijing, which has sought to describe the situation as strictly a business dispute.
 The Obama administration has been similarly cautious. Last week, a senior administration official said the United States would issue a ''demarche'' -- a diplomatic move often used to lodge a protest -- against China in the coming days. An official said Thursday that the administration would hold off to see whether the Chinese responded to Mrs. Clinton's call for an explanation of the Google allegations.
 The administration's dealings with China are further complicated by the American debt held by the Chinese government and issues like climate change, on which the United States is seeking its cooperation. Though Mrs. Clinton said the administration would air its differences with Beijing, she said it would be in the context of a ''positive, cooperative, and comprehensive relationship'' -- a clause added to her speech at the last minute.
 Mrs. Clinton also identified Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Tunisia, Vietnam and Uzbekistan as countries that constrain Internet freedom or persecute those who use the Web to circulate unpopular ideas. She pointed to an Egyptian blogger, Bassem Samir, who was in the audience at the Newseum in Washington for Mrs. Clinton's speech and had been imprisoned by Egyptian authorities.
 Human rights groups applauded the speech, though some questioned how the United States would enforce the warnings.
 Tom Malinowski, the Washington advocacy director for Human Rights Watch, said the United States should treat China's forced censorship as an unfair trade practice, which could be confronted through the World Trade Organization or raised in future trade negotiations. 
 Still, Mr. Malinowski said: ''I really thought this was groundbreaking. She showed no hesitation in naming countries, including U.S. allies, for suppressing speech on the Internet. She made a very strong case for connecting Internet freedom to core American national security interests.''
 As secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton has elevated the role of the Internet and digital technology in American diplomacy. She named Alec Ross, a technology entrepreneur who advised the campaign of President Obama, as her senior adviser for innovation. 
 Mr. Ross has assembled a team that is pursuing programs like a social network for young people in Pakistan and a service that lets people in Mexico file electronic reports on drug-related activity.
 Mrs. Clinton announced a new $15 million effort to help more young people, women and citizens groups in other countries communicate on the Web. None of the proposals she mentioned focused on China or Iran, and the financing is relatively modest. 
 For Cameran Ashraf, 29, an Iranian-American information technology worker who has helped Iranian protesters circumvent government filtering of their messages, Mrs. Clinton's tone was enough. ''I didn't expect such strong, forceful language,'' he said. ''I was beyond pleased.''

HEADLINE: Lobbies' New Power: Cross Us, And Our Cash Will Bury You

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Supreme Court has handed a new weapon to lobbyists. If you vote wrong, a lobbyist can now tell any elected official that my company, labor union or interest group will spend unlimited sums explicitly advertising against your re-election.
 ''We have got a million we can spend advertising for you or against you -- whichever one you want,' '' a lobbyist can tell lawmakers, said Lawrence M. Noble, a lawyer at Skadden Arps in Washington and former general counsel of the Federal Election Commission. 
 The decision seeks to let voters choose for themselves among a multitude of voices and ideas when they go to the polls, but it will also increase the power of organized interest groups at the expense of candidates and political parties. 
 It is expected to unleash a torrent of attack advertisements from outside groups aiming to sway voters, without any candidate having to take the criticism for dirty campaigning. The biggest beneficiaries might be well-placed incumbents whose favor companies and interests groups are eager to court. It could also have a big impact on state and local governments, where a few million dollars can have more influence on elections.
 The ruling comes at a time when influence-seekers of all kinds have special incentives to open their wallets. Amid the economic crisis, the Obama administration and Congressional Democrats are trying to rewrite the rules for broad swaths of the economy, from Detroit to Wall Street. Republicans, meanwhile, see a chance for major gains in November.
 Democrats predicted that Republicans would benefit most from the decision, because they are the traditional allies of big corporations, who have more money to spend than unions. 
 In a statement shortly after the decision, President Obama called it ''a green light to a new stampede of special interest money in our politics.'' 
 As Democrats vowed to push legislation to install new spending limits in time for the fall campaign, Republicans disputed the partisan impact of the decision. They argued that Democrats had proven effective at cultivating their own business allies -- drug companies are spending millions of dollars to promote the administration's health care proposals, for example -- while friendly interest groups tap sympathetic billionaires and Hollywood money. 
 After new restrictions on party fund-raising took effect in 2003, many predicted that the Democrats would suffer. But they took Congress in 2006 and the White House two years later.
 While Democrats pledged new limits, some Republicans argued for bolstering parties and candidates by getting rid of the limits on their fund-raising as well. Several cases before lower courts, including a suit filed by the Republican National Committee against the Federal Election Commission, seek to challenge those limits.
 Thursday's decision, in Citizens United vs. the Federal Election Commission, ''is going to flip the existing campaign order on its head,'' said Benjamin L. Ginsberg, a Republican campaign lawyer at the law-and-lobbying firm Patton Boggs who has represented both candidates and outside groups, including Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, a group formed to oppose Senator John Kerry's 2004 presidential campaign. 
 ''It will put on steroids the trend that outside groups are increasingly dominating campaigns,'' Mr. Ginsberg said. ''Candidates lose control of their message. Some of these guys lose control of their whole personalities.'' 
 ''Parties will sort of shrink in the relative importance of things,'' he added, ''and outside groups will take over more of the functions -- advertising support, get out the vote -- that parties do now.''
 In practice, major publicly held corporations like Microsoft or General Electric are unlikely to spend large sums money on campaign commercials, for fear of alienating investors, customers and other public officials. 
 Instead, wealthy individuals and companies might contribute to trade associations, groups like the Chamber of Commerce or the National Riffle Association, or other third parties that could run commercials.
 Previously, Mr. Noble of Skadden Arps said, his firm had advised companies to be wary about giving money to groups that might run so-called advocacy commercials, because such activity could trigger disclosure requirements that would identify the corporate financers.
 ''It could be traced back to you,'' he said. ''That is no longer a concern.'' 
 Some disclosure rules remain intact. An outside group paying for a campaign commercial would still have to include a statement and file forms taking responsibility. If an organization solicits money specifically to pay for such political activities, it could fall under regulations that require disclosure of its donors. 
 And the disclosure requirements would moderate the harshness of the third-party advertisements, because established trade associations or other groups are too concerned with their reputations to wage the contentious campaigns that ad hoc groups like MoveOn.org or Swift Boat Veterans for Truth might do.
 Two leading Democrats, Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York and Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, said that they had been working for months to draft legislation in response to the anticipated decision. 
 One possibility would be to ban political advertising by corporations that hire lobbyists, receive government money, or collect most of their revenue abroad. 
 Another would be to tighten rules against coordination between campaigns and outside groups so that, for example, they could not hire the same advertising firms or consultants. 
 A third would be to require shareholder approval of political expenditures, or even to force chief executives to appear as sponsors of commercials their companies pay for.
 The two sponsors of the 2002 law tightening the party-fundraising rules each criticized the ruling.
 Senator Russ Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin, called it ''a terrible mistake.'' Senator John McCain of Arizona, the Republican presidential nominee in 2008, said in a television interview on CNN that he was ''disappointed.''
 Fred Wertheimer, a longtime advocate of campaign finance laws, said the decision ''wipes out a hundred years of history'' during which American laws have sought to tamp down corporate power to influence elections.
 But David Bossie, the conservative activist who brought the case to defend his campaign-season promotion of the documentary ''Hillary: The Movie,'' said he was looking forward to rolling out his next film in time for the midterm elections. 
 Titled ''Generation Zero,'' the movie features the television host Lou Dobbs and lays much of the blame for the recent financial collapse on the Democrats.
 ''Now we have a free hand to let people know it exists,'' Mr. Bossie said.

HEADLINE: Record Profit At Goldman, But Bonuses Will Shrink

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY; Zachery Kouwe contributed reporting.

 BODY:
No one was crowing about their big paychecks at Goldman Sachs headquarters in New York on Thursday. Despite a record 2009, the bank announced that it had set aside only $16.2 billion to reward its employees. 
 Only? 
 If you have never worked on Wall Street, it is hard to grasp how 11 figures could be anything less than an enormous payday. But for Goldman, the financial and political calculations used to tally that number also added up to an uncharacteristic show of restraint. 
 In a surprising concession to the public outcry over big Wall Street bonuses, Goldman broke with the longtime industry practice of earmarking roughly half of its annual revenue for compensation. Indeed, the bank did the unthinkable for the final months of 2009: It subtracted about $500 million from its pay pool, rather than add more money to it, even though the bank earned a healthy $4.95 billion for the quarter, above Wall Street expectations. 
 Granted, Goldman's employees are still well paid by any measure. If compensation were spread evenly among its 32,500 employees, each would collect about $498,000. That's less than the $700,000 some had predicted several months ago. But in practice, pay at Goldman, as at other banks, is skewed heavily toward top producers, who stand to earn many millions while others collect much less. 
 But after the anger over big bonuses for bankers and, in particular, moves in Washington to clip Wall Street's wings, Goldman moved to deflect criticism of its resurgent profits and pay. Its bonus pool news was released on the same day that President Obama proposed legislation to limit the scope and size of large financial institutions and declared that banks nearly brought down the economy by taking ''huge, reckless risks in pursuit of quick profits and massive bonuses.''
 Within Goldman, employees grudgingly accepted the news Thursday, although some said they expected to be rewarded -- and soon -- for playing along with what they characterized as a temporary public relations exercise. The share of revenue being devoted to bonuses, 35.8 percent, was the lowest since the bank became a public company a decade ago. One employee in the Manhattan office said he believed Goldman would tack on extra money for pay during the first quarter and thus make up the difference. Another said he reserved judgment until he learned how much Goldman's top executives were being paid. 
 They and other Goldman employees spoke on the condition that they not be named, for fear of running afoul of their bosses. 
 ''It all depends on what Lloyd gets,'' said one midlevel Goldman employee, referring to Lloyd C. Blankfein, Goldman's chairman and chief executive. He said Mr. Blankfein's bonus had become a popular water-cooler topic. ''If Lloyd takes home a big bonus, even if it's all stock, and everyone else receives less, there will be some concern,'' he said. 
 In a tense conference call with journalists, David A. Viniar, Goldman's chief financial officer, repeatedly said the bank was showing restraint in its pay policies while trying to be fair to employees. ''We are not blind to the economic environment and the pain and suffering still going on around the world,'' Mr. Viniar said. 
 In an earlier concession to the public mood, Goldman announced in December that its top 30 executives would be paid only in deferred stock, with no cash component. Now, nearly everyone on Wall Street is waiting to see how much stock will be awarded to Mr. Blankfein. 
 In 2007, he was paid $68 million, a Wall Street record. He did not receive a bonus in 2008, but his bonus check for 2009 is expected to include several zeros, especially given Goldman's record year in 2009.
 Details of Mr. Blankfein's stock award are expected to emerge as soon as the Goldman board approves it, probably next week, and now everyone on Wall Street is waiting to find out who gets what from Goldman's bonus pool.
 Mr. Blankfein made no public appearance on Thursday as Goldman disclosed its 2009 financial results. Instead, in a terse statement, he referred to the full-throated outcry under way from Washington against Wall Street's big paydays while the rest of the economy was still suffering: ''Recognition of the broader environment,'' he said, had prompted the firm to moderate what it could have paid its employees. 
 Some critics doubted whether such temperance would be enough to puncture public criticism of Wall Street bonuses. ''The bonuses just add insult to injury,'' said Representative Dennis J. Kucinich, Democrat of Ohio, who has proposed a 75 percent bonus tax on Wall Street banks. ''If they want to regain public confidence, they should reduce or eliminate their bonus pool. You are going to see a backlash developing against Wall Street.''
 Lynn A. Stout, a professor of securities law at the University of California, Los Angeles, said the bank was ''parasitical,'' since it earned most of its profits from trading, not lending: ''Goldman Sachs needs to become a socially productive member of society,'' she said. ''At the moment, they don't have that claim.''
 Goldman's move undermined banks' claims that they could never cut bonuses because they would lose talent, said Lucian A. Bebchuk, a professor of finance at Harvard and an adviser to the United States Treasury on compensation. ''This announcement suggests that firms have flexibility in setting pay levels,'' he said.
 Mr. Viniar, meanwhile, who had one eye on his own employees and another on the political mood in Washington, refused to be drawn into whether the moderation in bonuses was a longstanding commitment to lower pay or a short-term measure that would be reversed next year.
 It should be regarded ''not as a one-time thing and not necessarily not as a one-time thing,'' he said.
 As it disclosed its results for 2009, Goldman said it made a record profit of $13.4 billion for the whole year on revenue of $45.2 billion.
 After a period in which the federal government devoted billions of taxpayers dollars to bailing out the banking industry, Mr. Viniar admitted that the bank had been ''clearly helped by government actions and policies.'' 
 But he quickly pointed out that Goldman had repaid its federal bailout aid -- with interest -- and rebuffed ideas that the firm benefited from all government policies. Goldman did not especially gain any advantage from the current low interest rates, he said, because it used financial hedging to thrive in both low and high interest rate environments. 
 ''It was not the only thing that drove our performance,'' he said in an interview, referring to government programs supporting the banking industry. ''Our people, I think, did a really good job.''
 Mr. Viniar said Goldman's rebound in 2009 from its single quarterly loss in the final three months of 2008 had been led by its strong trading activities.
 That activity dropped off in the fourth quarter of 2009, he said, but revenue was made up by a strong showing in investment banking activities, like equity and debt underwriting. The steep slowdown in trading, however, had already begun to reverse itself in 2010, he said.

HEADLINE: Treasury Weighs Fixes to a Program to Fend Off Foreclosures

BYLINE: By PETER S. GOODMAN

 BODY:
The Obama administration plans next week to revamp its $75 billion program aimed at sparing homeowners from foreclosure, streamlining the documents required of borrowers seeking lowered payments, according to financial industry executives and others who have met in recent days with Treasury officials.
 The latest effort to accelerate the Making Home Affordable program -- now widely viewed as a disappointment -- comes as the administration faces growing pressure to do less for banks and more for households struggling with double-digit unemployment. 
 The changes by the Treasury Department are expected to include greater assistance for homeowners no longer able to make mortgage payments because their paychecks have shrunk, said banking industry representatives privy to the department's deliberations who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of alienating government officials.
 The Treasury was still debating the method, these banking representatives said, looking at either direct cash assistance or a grace period in which borrowers could postpone payments. That component may not be announced next week, but would follow soon after. 
 Housing experts said the anticipated changes would probably cause mortgage companies to move more quickly to lower payments for borrowers, though perhaps at the cost of prolonging the foreclosure crisis. Requiring less documentation of borrowers' incomes carries a risk of lending to people who simply cannot afford their homes, increasing the likelihood of subsequent delinquency.
 ''They are turning this from a legitimate program to try to save people who have the ability to hang on their homes into one that says, forget the willingness and ability to pay, let's just postpone foreclosures,'' said Edward Pinto, a mortgage industry consultant who served as chief credit officer at Fannie Mae in the late 1980s. 
 While declining to provide details, the Treasury confirmed its plans to alter the program at a meeting next week with mortgage companies -- servicers, in industry parlance.
 ''We expect to issue guidance to servicers next week to expedite conversions of current trial modifications and provide guidance on documentation,'' the Treasury's assistant secretary for financial institutions, Michael S. Barr, wrote in response to a reporter's questions. ''We are continually reviewing our housing plan to ensure that it promotes stability.''
 The changes to be introduced next week are unlikely to address what has emerged as a potent factor propelling a wave of foreclosures: the roughly 15 million borrowers who are said to be underwater, meaning that they owe more than their homes are worth. But the Treasury is actively considering ways to attack this problem, financial industry representatives said.
 Many economists and mortgage experts have concluded that banks must ultimately forgive loan balances to restore equity to underwater borrowers. Otherwise, growing numbers will walk away from their homes and accept foreclosure rather than make payments on properties in which they no longer own a stake.
 The Treasury has resisted calls to push lenders to write off loan balances, concerned that such a course would either threaten the health of banks by forcing them to swallow billions of dollars in write-offs or cost taxpayers additional money. 
 The administration has instead focused on ramping up its existing program, which pays mortgage companies that lower mortgage payments. The vast majority of loan modifications to date have lowered payments by dropping interest rates while leaving balances untouched. 
 When President Obama outlined the program nearly a year ago, he said it would prevent three million to four million foreclosures by 2012. As of December, mortgage companies had modified 759,000 loans on a trial basis, typically lasting three to five months. But only about 31,000 homeowners had received so-called permanent loan modifications, which lower payments for five years.
 ''There's a great degree of frustration about how this has been going,'' said Alan M. White, a professor at Valparaiso University Law School.
 The changes expected next week are intended to alleviate one roadblock: the voluminous paperwork mortgage companies must process to qualify borrowers for lower payments.
 Homeowners complain that mortgage companies routinely lose their documents, forcing them to repeatedly resend files. Mortgage companies have acknowledged problems, while also blaming homeowners for failing to provide required documents.
 The Treasury is likely to alter the program by making pay stubs an acceptable means of verifying income, rather than requiring tax documents, said the people close to the deliberations. 
 One reason that mortgage companies are having such difficulty processing paperwork, they acknowledge, is that they lack adequate experience. During the housing boom, major institutions like Countrywide (now part of Bank of America) and Washington Mutual (since folded into JPMorgan Chase) marketed themselves as easy lenders motivated to approve mortgages with little fuss. They specialized in mortgages that required little or no documentation, sometimes called liar loans, which led borrowers and mortgage brokers to exaggerate incomes and assets. 
 Some experts fear that the Obama administration is now so eager to slow foreclosures that it is willing to employ the same sorts of loose lending standards that delivered the crisis.
 ''It definitely does lead to the question, are they substituting liar loan modifications for liar loans?'' Mr. Pinto said.
 Consumer advocates welcomed the prospect of a new effort aimed at accelerating loan modifications, while questioning whether the proposed changes would be significant.
 ''The results are dismal so far,'' said Julia R. Gordon, senior policy counsel for the Center for Responsible Lending in Washington. ''We need a game changer.''
 Throughout the financial system and within government, a sense is taking hold that the only effective way to stem foreclosures is to write off loan balances.
 ''We realized early on that if we don't include principal treatment, you just don't get the buy-in from the borrower to stay with it,'' said Paul A. Koches, general counsel for Ocwen Financial, a major mortgage company that claims conspicuous success in converting trial loan modifications to permanent arrangements.
 As of mid-December, Ocwen had turned about 40 percent of its trial modifications into permanent arrangements, according to the Treasury. By comparison, JPMorgan Chase had converted only 4 percent of its trial loan modifications into permanent status; the rate was less than 2 percent at Bank of America.
 Servicers merely collect mortgage bills for a fee. Most loans are owned by investors. They are increasingly inclined to accept losses by writing down loan balances in exchange for greater assurance that borrowers will be able to make payments. 
 ''Investors are willing to put real money on the table toward refinancing borrowers from bad mortgages into good mortgages,'' said Micah S. Green, a partner based in Washington at the law firm Patton Boggs, who represents a consortium of institutional mortgage holders. 
 The Obama administration has begun to consider a new push to reduce loan balances, while debating the proper mechanism, according to banking officials.
 ''They are looking at equity forgiveness,'' said a financial industry executive who speaks regularly with Treasury officials. ''There have been a lot of meetings on that.''
 But the details are messy, requiring a complex balancing of competing interests. Not least, the owners of first mortgages are unwilling to accept losses by writing down loan balances unless the pain is shared by the owners of second mortgages.
 Many second mortgages, including home equity loans, are owned by the very banks that are in the middle of determining whether and how to modify first mortgages -- servicers like Bank of America and Chase. For them, taking losses on second mortgages would entail stripping away billions of dollars in assets from their balance sheets.
 ''The banks are kind of in denial that second mortgages aren't going to get paid in full,'' said Professor White of Valparaiso. ''Treasury has to find a way to compel the banks to take a hit.''

HEADLINE: A Good Place for Google's Cash

BYLINE: By ROBERT CYRAN and MARTIN HUTCHINSON

 BODY:
Cash, not China, is Google's biggest conundrum. More precisely, where should the search giant point its gusher of greenbacks? The online advertising market recovery and increasing efficiency pushed free cash flow up 44 percent, to $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter. Adding that to the company's $24 billion cash hoard doesn't make sense. But giving it to shareholders does.
 Google's warning that it may shut down its operations in China in response to online attacks on its business has gained all the attention over the last few weeks. While investors might fear the potential impact of pulling out of one of the fastest-growing search markets, in reality Google's problem in China is relatively small potatoes compared with the challenge of spending its money wisely. 
 The company, led by Eric Schmidt, the chief executive, says it will invest heavily. Fair enough -- revenue increased 17 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, and such growth calls for some extra capacity. But adding capacity won't take that much cash. Capital expenditure was just $289 million in the quarter and even spending twice as much every three months, as Google did in 2007 and 2008, would hardly make a dent in the company's bank balance. 
 Of course, Google also sees lots of potential business opportunities it can justify spending money on. Cellular data traffic is going through the roof, and the mobile search market will boom as more consumers buy smartphones. Online software services and social networks are two other high-growth areas rightly highlighted by Google. 
 Yet even these initiatives are inadequate to answer the question of what Google should do with its cash. It is already pursuing them. But free cash flow is still rising. It can buy other companies, but Google's largest acquisition so far was YouTube for $1.7 billion, and that was in stock. So it is unlikely the company can find enough good candidates to justify holding on to so much cash for acquisitions. Handing a chunk of it to shareholders, through dividends or buybacks, is overdue. 
 America the Buoyant
 Those betting on an end to American economic hegemony may need to wait longer than they expect. Thanks to flexible labor markets, the productivity of the American worker actually rose 2.5 percent in 2009, according to the Conference Board's Total Economy Database updates released on Wednesday. Productivity in the euro zone declined. Emerging market productivity is continuing to catch up, but on these figures, European rather than American living standards look more immediately vulnerable.
 The increase in productivity was painful, coming in a year when gross domestic product declined 2.5 percent, employment slid 3.6 percent and hours worked per employee were 1.5 percent lower. Nevertheless, the gain in productivity improves the nation's competitive position against Europe and Japan, both of which suffered larger decreases in G.D.P. but reduced employment less.
 Indeed, 2009 had the world's first overall drop in productivity since 1991. The measure declined by 1 percent compared with a decline of 0.1 percent 18 years earlier. Declines in the developed world were offset in major emerging markets, where productivity increased by 3.6 percent. China had the strongest productivity growth at 8.2 percent, followed by India at 3.9 percent.
 In the long term, rising living standards and continued competitiveness depend on rising productivity. Other factors, like lower hours worked per week and lower labor force participation, make living standards in France and Germany significantly below those in the United States, in spite of almost equal productivity.
 That is a trade-off that those societies make, mostly voluntarily. But an economy in which productivity growth persistently underperforms its competitors can find both its living standards declining and its international competitiveness reduced. 
 Looked at from this perspective, America's productivity performance in 2009 was encouraging, as has been the case since 1995. Should such growth continue, the predicted relative economic decline will be postponed -- perhaps indefinitely.

HEADLINE: With Populist Stance, Obama Takes On Banks

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The tougher approach to financial regulation that President Obama outlined on Thursday reflected a changed political climate, the rebound in big banks' fortunes after their taxpayer bailout and a shift in power within the administration away from those who had been seen as most sympathetic to Wall Street.
 In calling for new limits on the size of big banks and their ability to make risky bets, Mr. Obama was throwing a public punch at Wall Street for the third time in a week, underscoring the imperative for him and his party to strike a more populist tone, especially after the Republican victory Tuesday in the Massachusetts Senate race.
 In announcing his proposals Thursday at the White House, Mr. Obama said if the financial industry wanted a fight over new restrictions, it was a fight he was ready to have. 
 The new approach was welcomed by the White House political team and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., and delivered by a less enthusiastic economic team on orders last month from Mr. Obama. 
 It was also a victory for Paul A. Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman and outside adviser to Mr. Obama. 
 Until Thursday, when he stood beside the president at the White House announcement of the new policy, Mr. Volcker truly had been on the outside of administration decision-making. And, in frustration, he had been increasingly vocal about the need for the administration to clamp down on what he described as the casinolike operations at the big banks that nearly destroyed the financial system in the first place.
 In adopting the tougher line, Mr. Obama set aside a more limited approach to regulation that had been championed since last year by his economic team, led by Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner. 
 Yet even Mr. Geithner of late has been moving toward a tougher stance on Wall Street, in part out of anger that big banks, having ridden a taxpayer bailout back to comfortable profitability, are now rewarding themselves with big bonuses and fighting harder in Congress against the administration's initiative to tighten regulation of the financial system. 
 The issue reignited speculation, common in the administration's early months, that Mr. Geithner and perhaps Lawrence H. Summers, the senior White House economic adviser, were not long for the Obama world given broad public perceptions that they remained too close to the financial industry. 
 But numerous administration officials said that both men had earned the trust and confidence of Mr. Obama, who believed they had not received credit for stabilizing a financial system that by all accounts was on the verge of collapse when the president took office.
 His pique on that score came through in his televised interview with ABC News on Wednesday, after the loss in Massachusetts, even as Mr. Obama empathized with Americans' anger about the bailout effort, the Troubled Asset Relief Program, that he inherited from George W. Bush.
 ''Now if I tell them, 'Well, it turns out that we will actually have gotten TARP paid back and that we're going to make sure that a fee's imposed on the big banks so that this thing will cost the taxpayers not a dime,' that's helpful,'' Mr. Obama said. ''But it doesn't eliminate the sense that their voices aren't heard and that institutions are betraying them.'' 
 To change that, he added, ''We're about to get into a big fight with the banks.''
 That fight is sure to continue testing Mr. Geithner, as well as Mr. Summers and lesser-known members of the economic team who are seen by others in the West Wing as politically tone-deaf. Yet Mr. Geithner, in an interview, said he foresaw no problems.
 ''Just because things seem populist doesn't mean they're not the right thing to do,'' he said. 
 The administration's new tack suggests just how much big banks have miscalculated Americans' intensified resentment against the bailout -- anger stoked by persistent high unemployment, banks' stinginess in lending to small business and the revival of Wall Street's bonus culture. 
 They have become the perfect foil for the White House as it tries to lead the Democratic Party out of its post-Massachusetts morass -- and to change the channel from the seemingly unending debate over health insurance. As the White House hopes to define the fight, the enemy is not big government but big money.
 One problem for the Obama team, as some Congressional Democrats lament, is that its moves of late look poll-driven and overly reactive to the Democrats' implosion in the Bay State race. To be sure, worse for the White House than Scott Brown's win is the fact that the Republican won as an agent of change just as Mr. Obama did in 2008 -- only this time, of course, the change was not from Bush administration policies but from Mr. Obama's.
 Despite the timing, however, all three of Mr. Obama's recent policy stands have been in the works for some time. That is not to say they were not politically motivated; for some months, the administration has been concerned about Mr. Obama's slipping support in the polls and many Americans' perception of his administration as too cozy with Wall Street.
 The president's proposal last week for a tax on about 50 of the nation's biggest banks to recoup any losses from the bailout began taking shape at the Treasury last August for inclusion in the budget that Mr. Obama will send to Congress in February, administration officials said. 
 Aside from its value as a way to raise $90 billion over 10 years, a time frame in which Mr. Obama is eager to cut deficits, the bank tax helped mute long-running criticism of Mr. Geithner for his opposition last summer to European leaders' calls for taxing bank bonuses and transactions.
 Earlier this week, with action heating up in the Senate over legislation for regulating banks, administration officials spread the word that Mr. Obama's proposal to create an independent consumer protection agency was ''non-negotiable.'' Industry lobbyists have made killing the agency a priority, while liberal groups have made its creation a test of Mr. Obama's leadership. 
 Mr. Obama personally weighed in with a lengthy meeting at the White House on Tuesday with the panel's chairman, Senator Christopher J. Dodd, a Democrat from Connecticut. 
 Until now, the president has had a low profile on the banking bill, though the House debated its version most of last year before passing it in December. 
 Some Democrats complain that the White House was too absorbed by the health care issue, but they acknowledge the banking issue was widely seen as an insider's game over arcane issues like derivatives trading that have little resonance with the public.
 Now that has changed. As Thursday's call for new bank limits showed, the president personally is taking the lead as First Populist. 
 ''Never again,'' he said, ''will the American taxpayer be held hostage by a bank that is too big to fail.''

HEADLINE: Politics in the Age of Distrust

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
In November 2008, William A. Galston and Elaine C. Kamarck wrote a report called ''Change You Can Believe In Needs a Government You Can Trust.'' Galston and Kamarck, who served in senior positions in the Clinton administration, threw up some warning flags for the incoming Obama administration.
 Despite the Democratic triumph that month, they noted, public distrust of government remains intensely high. Historically, it has been nearly impossible to pass major domestic reforms in the face of that kind of distrust. Therefore, they counseled, the new administration should move cautiously to rebuild trust before beginning a transformational agenda. 
 The Obama administration interpreted the political climate in an entirely different way. As John F. Harris and Carol E. Lee wrote in a smart piece in Politico on Wednesday, the administration interpreted the 2008 election as a rejection of not only George W. Bush-style conservatism, but also Bill Clinton-style moderation. The country was ready for a New Deal-size change. It had a leader in Barack Obama who could uniquely inspire a national transformation.
 As happens every four years, hubris defeated caution, and the administration began its big-bang approach.
 As always, it backfired. Instead of building trust in government, the Democrats have magnified distrust. The country already believed Washington is out of touch with its core concerns. So while most families were concerned about jobs, Democrats in Washington spent nine months arguing about health care. The country was already tired of self-serving back-room deals, so the Democrats negotiated a series of dirty deals with the pharmaceutical industry, the unions and certain senators. Americans already felt Washington doesn't understand their fears and insecurities. So at the moment when economic insecurity was at its peak, the Democrats in Washington added another layer of insecurity by threatening to change everything at once.
 Instead of building a new majority, the Democrats have set off a distrust insurrection (which is not the same as a conservative insurrection). Republicans are enraged. Independents are furious. Democrats are disheartened. Health care reform is brutally unpopular. Even voters in Massachusetts decided it was time to send a message.
 The Democrats now have four bad options. The first is what you might call the Heedless and Arrogant Approach. A clear majority of Americans are against the Congressional health care reform plan. Democrats could say: We know this is unpopular, but we think it is good policy and we are going to ram it through and you voters can judge us by the results.
 The second route is what you might call the Weak and Feckless Approach. Democrats could say: We have received and respect the message voters are sending. We are not going to shove the biggest social transformation in a generation down the throats of a country that has judged and rejected it. We are not going to concentrate immense new powers in a Washington the country detests.
 Instead, we will regroup and reorganize. Perhaps we will try incremental reforms. Perhaps we will use federal money to support a series of state reform efforts -- like the one in Massachusetts -- which are closer to the people. (In 2007, Russ Feingold, a Democrat, and Lindsey Graham, a Republican, co-sponsored the State-Based Health Care Reform Act to spark this kind of local experimentation.)
 The third approach is the Dangerous and Demagogic Approach. This begins with the presumption that what Americans really want is a bunch of pseudopopulists to tell them they can have everything for free. This would mean stripping the health bills of anything that might be unpopular -- like Medicare cuts and tax increases -- and passing the rest regardless of the cost.
 The fourth approach is the Incoherent and Internecine Approach. This would involve settling on no coherent policy but just blaming each other for cowardice and stupidity for the next month. Liberals, who make up 20 percent of the country, could complain because they didn't get their version of reform. The Senate and the House could bash each other. The intelligentsia could bash the public.
 Right now, Incoherent and Internecine is winning, but the hard choice is between the first two approaches. Galston, ironically, now supports Heedless and Arrogant. It was a mistake to rush into health care, he believes, but now that the party is down the road it would be suicide to turn back. Democrats should stand for what they believe in. If the policy works, then public trust will follow.
 I support the Weak and Feckless Approach. Trust is based on mutual respect and reciprocity. If, at this moment of rage and cynicism, the ruling class goes even further and snubs popular opinion, then that will set off an ugly, destructive, and yet fully justified popular rebellion. Trust in government will be irrevocably broken. It will decimate policy-making for a generation.
 These are the choices ahead. Have a nice day.

HEADLINE: G.E. Profit Drops 19%, But Beats Predictions

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
General Electric's profit fell 19 percent in the fourth quarter, the company said on Friday, a better result than Wall Street had expected. But mounting commercial loan losses and dwindling demand for items like jet engines raised some concerns among analysts, even though the company said it was on track for growth this year.
 G.E. was hurt by lower revenue on some of its signature products -- locomotives, for instance -- and persistent troubles in commercial lending. Earnings at its financial unit were down 67 percent compared with the period a year earlier, and profit at NBC Universal, which the company is selling to Comcast, fell 30 percent. 
 Still, the company's backlog of orders for a range of equipment, including hospital sonograms and water filtration systems, reached a record $175 billion, indicating potential for growth.
 In total, G.E.'s profit was $3 billion, or 28 cents a share, in the last quarter of 2009, compared with $3.7 billion, or 35 cents, in the period a year earlier. Analysts had expected profit to be $2.77 billion, or 26 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters. 
 Jeffrey R. Immelt, G.E.'s chief executive, predicted that earnings would remain flat in 2010 before climbing in 2011. 
 ''The world we look at really has improved,'' Mr. Immelt told investors in a conference call on Friday. He cautioned, however, that ''we continue to operate the company with discipline.''
 Completed orders remain slightly below their levels a year ago, dragging down revenue. Businesses are reluctant to spend money to service their equipment. G.E. said, for instance, that 5,000 locomotives remained out of use in the United States. Over all, revenue fell 10 percent in the fourth quarter, to $41.4 billion. In 2009, revenue was down 14 percent, at $156.7 billion, compared with $182.5 billion in 2008. 
 For the year, G.E. said it had net income of about $11 billion, a 38 percent drop from $17.47 billion in 2008. The company also said it took a 9-cent charge, some of it related to restructuring, that was mostly offset by 6 cents of gains.
 G.E. is in the midst of reshaping its business after a steep drop in global demand and large losses on loans. Analysts say they believe it is well positioned to profit this year, particularly on industrial goods in emerging markets, as governments use stimulus dollars for public-works projects and businesses expand.
 But G.E.'s status as a behemoth -- its activities are as varied as issuing mortgages and managing a media unit -- has left it vulnerable to weaknesses across all parts of the economy. The company's financial unit, G.E. Capital, for instance, has been pummeled by the collapse of the commercial real estate market and a steady rise in consumers who are unable to pay their bills.
 Still, even G.E. Capital has been able to turn a profit -- its earnings totaled $336 million in the fourth quarter -- largely because of tax credits. Commercial real estate was the only part of G.E. Capital not to make money in the fourth quarter: it lost $593 million, for a total of $1.5 billion in 2009.
 Mr. Immelt said on Friday that commercial real estate losses would increase this year, even as delinquencies on mortgages and credit cards eased. To shield itself against further losses, G.E. is gradually reducing the size of the unit's portfolio and imposing stricter lending standards. 
 ''We think losses in capital finance will stabilize in 2010 and start to decline,'' Mr. Immelt said.
 Steven E. Winoker, an analyst at Bernstein Research, said the country's high jobless rate -- 10 percent in December -- could cause losses on loans and drag the company's earnings down more than expected.
 ''Unemployment remains stubbornly negative, and the impact of that on a longer-term basis could be worse than people are saying,'' Mr. Winoker said. 
 Managing such a large, diverse business has proved difficult for G.E. executives. In the third quarter of 2009, the company said profits were down 44 percent from the previous year. G.E.'s credit rating was downgraded last year, and its dividend was cut by two-thirds. 
 The company's stock remains far from the highs of the 1990s, when G.E. was one of the Dow Jones industrial average's best performers. It is now one of the worst, and rose 0.56 percent to close at $16.11 on Friday, up from $7 in March. 
 Richard Tortoriello, an analyst at Standard & Poor's, said the company recognized the need to consolidate its business.
 ''They've gotten the message they need a more streamlined company,'' Mr. Tortoriello said. ''What G.E. would like to do is focus more on what they see as their core business, which is industrial equipment.''
 Adding to the distractions are the travails of NBC Universal. G.E. is negotiating a $30 billion deal to shift control of the network to Comcast, but the deal faces regulatory hurdles in the United States and Europe. Analysts said that even if the sale ran into turbulence, the company's finances would not suffer because cash flow remained abundant.
 On Friday, executives said some of the decline at NBC was the result of worse-than-expected DVD sales, which fell about 36 percent. Revenue from online advertising was also weak.

HEADLINE: Most U.S. Union Members Are Working For the Government, New Data Shows

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
For the first time in American history, a majority of union members are government workers rather than private-sector employees, the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced on Friday.
 In its annual report on union membership, the bureau undercut the longstanding notion that union members are overwhelmingly blue-collar factory workers. It found that membership fell so fast in the private sector in 2009 that the 7.9 million unionized public-sector workers easily outnumbered those in the private sector, where labor's ranks shrank to 7.4 million, from 8.2 million in 2008. 
 ''There has been steady growth among union members in the public sector, but I'm a little bit shocked to see that the lines have actually crossed,'' said Randel K. Johnson, senior vice president for labor at the United States Chamber of Commerce. 
 According to the labor bureau, 7.2 percent of private-sector workers were union members last year, down from 7.6 percent the previous year. That, labor historians said, was the lowest percentage of private-sector workers in unions since 1900.
 Among government workers, union membership grew to 37.4 percent last year, from 36.8 percent in 2008.
 Gerald W. McEntee, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, voiced dismay that government employees now represented a majority of union members.
 ''It's a very bad sign,'' he said. ''We've been banged around some, but when you see what's been happening to the industrial base of this country, to the steelworkers, to the autoworkers, they're been hammered much more.''
 After rising the two previous years, overall union membership fell by 771,000 in 2009, to 15.3 million, largely because employment declined over all. But the rate of private-sector unionization fell because two sectors where unions are especially strong -- manufacturing and construction -- suffered especially large job losses. Construction lost more than 900,000 jobs last year, falling to 5.9 million, while 1.3 million factory jobs were lost, declining to 11.6 million. 
 The overall unionization rate edged lower, to 12.3 percent last year from 12.4 percent in 2008. 
 Damon A. Silvers, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s policy director, said the decline in private-sector unionization ''tells us that good jobs are disappearing faster than bad jobs.''
 According to the labor bureau, median weekly earnings for full-time unionized workers were $908 last year, compared with $710 for workers not represented by unions. The bureau attributed this difference not just to unionization but also to variations by occupation, industry and company size.
 Notwithstanding the recession, government employment grew last year, inching up 16,000, to 22,516,000, according to the bureau.
 Fred Siegel, a visiting professor of history at St. Francis College in Brooklyn and a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative research organization, said, ''There were enormous political ramifications'' to the fact that public-sector workers are now the majority in organized labor. 
 ''At the same time the country is being squeezed, public-sector unions are a rising political force in the Democratic Party,'' he said. ''They depend on extra money for the public sector, and that puts the Democrats in a difficult position. In four big states -- New York, New Jersey, Illinois and California -- the public-sector unions have largely been untouched by the economic downturn. In those states, you have an impeding clash between the public-sector unions and the public at large.''
 Several labor officials and scholars said private-sector workers could regain their majority in a year or two because of potential large-scale layoffs of government workers in the face of the budget squeeze faced by so many cities and states. 
 Assessing the drop in private-sector unionization, Paula B. Voos, a labor relations professor at Rutgers, said, ''It's a sad commentary on the ability of private-sector workers to unionize.''
 ''Unions have less strength when they represent a lower percentage of workers,'' she said. ''Nonetheless, unions have strength in those sectors of the economy where they are organized. Workers who are in the entertainment industry, workers who are on the docks of the Port of New York and New Jersey still have the strength of their labor organizations.''
 Noting that union members generally have higher earnings, Labor Secretary Hilda Solis said in a statement: ''As workers across the country have seen their real and nominal wages decline as a result of the recession, these numbers show a need for Congress to pass legislation to level the playing field to enable more American workers to access the benefits of union membership. This report makes clear why the administration supports the Employee Free Choice Act,'' a bill that would make it easier to unionize.''
 But J. Justin Wilson, managing director of the Center for Union Facts, a corporate-backed group opposing that legislation, had a different response to the report.
 ''Labor union membership is an outdated concept for most working Americans,'' he said. ''It is a relic of Depression-era labor-management relations.''

HEADLINE: Haiti's Aftershocks Felt at a School in New York

BYLINE: By ANNE BARNARD; Jano Tantongco contributed reporting.

 BODY:
To make sense of the earthquake, the eighth-grade science class analyzed plate tectonics, used computer animation to simulate tremors of different magnitudes, and browsed satellite images to zero in on their family villages in Haiti. Down the hall, a kindergarten teacher took a lower-tech approach: piling Legos on two cardboard squares and bumping them together until the toy buildings crashed down.
 In the fourth grade, a skinny, bright-eyed boy, dressed up for his first day back at his old school in a sweater-vest, tie and jeweled cross, needed no simulation to visualize the catastrophe. Joshua Joseph, 10, was playing Twister at his aunt's house in Port-au-Prince when the world shook, sending him on an odyssey -- sleeping outside, riding through streets that reeked of corpses, flying on an Air Force plane -- that brought him back to SS. Joachim and Anne, the parish school he left two years ago when his parents sent him to Haiti to get to know their home country. 
 Last week's earthquake has devastated Haiti, and prompted a massive relief effort. In a smaller but almost equally intense way, the disaster has pervaded every part of the school day for the 510 students -- 80 percent of them Haitian -- at SS. Joachim and Anne, the Roman Catholic elementary school in Queens Village, Queens, a hub of New York's Haitian community.
 They pray. They scrounge up donations. The quake informs class discussions about politics, about helping the poor, about the afterlife. And when the children are not talking about it, their teachers suspect, they are thinking about it. 
 As classmates played with cubes on Wednesday, learning to add, Michael Constant, 6, squirmed in his seat. His mother had just left for Haiti that morning to bury his father. 
 As 250,000 Haitian-Americans in the New York area mourn, children bear their own burdens. Many feel as much at home in Haiti as in New York. They struggle to picture the houses where they spent summers now in rubble, grandparents and cousins dead, missing, homeless. For others, Haiti exists in tales parents tell -- a place they long to visit and now wonder if they will ever see. 
 And, as three days this week at the school make clear, a subtle but evident role reversal is under way, as child after child feels responsibility to take care of parents bewildered by grief. 
 Sitting on kindergarten-size chairs in the library, one seventh grader told a counselor she felt ''wrong inside'' when, for the first time, she heard her mother cry. Another said that in a culture where mourning often means wailing, what most terrified her was her grandmother's quiet, insistent prayer.
 ''We do the best we can to make them feel safe,'' said Sal Violo, the counselor. But, he said, with aftershocks still hitting Haiti, he cannot promise them that nothing like the disaster will happen again. 
 SS. Joachim and Anne is an old-school school, with towering ceilings, school uniforms, an ancient public-address system, and a principal, Linda Freebes, who acts as a kind of air-traffic controller not just for the school but for the neighborhood. 
 On Tuesday, the sense of chaos was growing as more families got bad news; one boy said he lost 30 cousins. Mrs. Freebes's toy Yorkie, Faith, trotted the hallways in a pink barrette, cheering people up. Outside the principal's office sat James Augustin, a 12-year-old altar boy in trouble for talking back. ''It's very unlike James,'' she said. His grandmother, who cooks him chicken and rice after school when not wintering in Haiti, was still missing.
 Mrs. Freebes sent money to Michael Constant's mother for the funeral trip; two alumni had already called wanting to help newly strained families pay the $3,400 tuition.
 One was Brian Simon, 28, a Congressional aide with a Haitian mother. The other was Rich Winters, 58, whose wife, Cecilia, an economist, studies the roots of Haitian poverty. Both said the school fostered discipline, morality and lasting bonds. It is unchanged since his childhood, Mr. Winters said, ''just now everyone's a different color.'' 
 The first Haitians to join the parish were political refugees, some leaving behind servants and mansions. Then came the ''boat people,'' desperately poor.
 Wednesday morning, Mrs. Freebes assigned the daily sacrifice for Haiti: Say ''Glory Be to the Father,'' then do something special for your teacher. Then she had good news: James's grandmother had been found. 
 In a kindergarten classroom plastered with cheerful posters -- ''L is for Lollipop'' -- Yariela Thomas talked through the disaster. ''A lot of people died. But who is always taking care of people?'' she asked. ''God,'' the children answered. 
 They drew pictures to comfort their parents. Sierra Griffin drew a house. Inside were three people, one of them lying down, with x's for eyes. That one was dead. 
 Sniegouca Laconte drew her mother and baby brother. Visa problems have separated them for most of her life. She dictated a caption: ''My mommy is in Haiti but she is O.K.''
 Sniegouca's cousins, Naila and Andy Zephyr, had had a stressful week. ''My mom, she's really dramatic,'' said Naila, 12, and so is her little sister. ''So me and my brother have to comfort both of them.'' 
 Naila spoke dreamily of summers in Haiti, eating spicy seafood from street vendors, going to beaches that are ''blue and clear and nice.'' Now her mother's best friend was dead. Naila remembered the woman, who sang a beautiful dirge at her grandfather's funeral.
 Now, she said, her mother screams that she cannot live without her.
 ''We tell her that she's in a better place,'' Naila said.
 ''And we bring her tea,'' said Andy, 11. 
 In the science class, Rod Beauplan, 13, pointed the satellite map to his village, Belle Fontaine, relatively unscathed, where his relatives -- except an uncle -- had been. 
 ''Have you heard from your uncle?'' the teacher asked. 
 ''He's dead,'' said Rod.
 ''How can you hear from him if he's dead?'' a classmate scoffed.
 It was still eighth grade. 
 Joshua Joseph, just airlifted from Haiti, told his story in a rapid-fire patter, as though if he kept talking, he could ward off the experience. ''My whole body was shaking,'' he said. ''My aunt was yelling, 'Joshua, come!' and she had a baby in her hands.'' 
 They stood under an archway as a wall tumbled down. Downtown, buildings fell all around Joshua's young cousin. 
 ''He saw people die. He saw blood,'' Joshua said. And, he believed, the cousin saw the hand of God: when a nearby house teetered, ''God holded the house for him.''
 Most of all, Joshua feared for his mother in Queens. The disaster was so enormous, he said, ''I thought the earthquake was in New York too.''

HEADLINE: When N.F.L. Ruled Airwaves With Blackouts

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR. 
E-mail: sandor@nytimes.com

 BODY:
In the dark days of silly, anti-fan blackouts, Jets fans had to travel at least 75 miles outside the New York City market to watch their team beat the Oakland Raiders in the 1968 American Football League championship game. 
 If the same restrictions were still in effect, fans in the Indianapolis market would not be able to watch their Colts play the Jets in the American Football Conference championship game on CBS on Sunday at 3 p.m. Eastern. 
 The blackout rule enforced for years before and after 1968 by the A.F.L. and the N.F.L. prohibited viewers from watching their teams play at home for fear that giving away the games on television would hurt attendance.
 It did not matter whether the game had sold out.
 On that late December day, Jets fans could not tune in Channel 4 at 1 p.m. to see the game at Shea Stadium; the station was carrying a movie, ''The Prince and the Pauper.''
 So fans escaped to bars, friends' homes and motels in Schenectady, N.Y., Hartford and Philadelphia to watch the Jets' 27-23 victory. Or they waited until 11:30 p.m. for the tape-delayed NBC broadcast on Channel 4. 
 Elliot Baron was 19, but strep throat prevented him from going to the game with his father. 
 ''My mother wouldn't let me go,'' he said. ''It was very cold that day, and Shea was very windy.''
 He recalled that he did not listen to the game on the radio or watch other media coverage, and he asked his father not to tell him what had happened when he returned from the stadium. 
 He wanted to see it, as if it were live, on TV.
 ''We were at the first game at Shea,'' he said, ''so it was so exciting to watch, especially when Ralph Baker picked up the lateral.'' In the fourth quarter, a lateral (intended as a swing pass) from Oakland quarterback Daryle Lamonica rolled off Charlie Smith's hands, and Baker, a Jets linebacker, recovered the fumble.
 Paul Farash knew even at age 10 that if you did not go to a Jets home game, you could not see it on TV. He and his father attended the A.F.L. championship game, seated in Section 17 in the upper deck. 
 When they returned to South Jamaica, Queens, local TV news reported that the taped broadcast would be on at 11:30. 
 ''I couldn't wait to watch a game from Shea,'' Farash said. ''You never saw one before.'' 
 So he took a nap at 8:30 and was awakened in time to watch the game again. ''I have indelible memories of plays from certain camera angles,'' Farash said.
 He went to sleep satisfied, sometime after 2 a.m.
 The Jets then beat the Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III in Miami; the NFL Network is replaying NBC's coverage of that game at 8:30 Saturday night. 
 But a copy of the Jets-Raiders title game -- shown before networks routinely preserved tapes and well before home VCRs were common -- has not been found by the league or NBC. 
 ''We filmed it,'' said Steve Sabol, the president of NFL Films. The film was used recently in an episode about the 1968 Jets in the NFL Network's ''America's Game'' series.
 The league's blackout rule was challenged unsuccessfully in various lawsuits. The N.F.L. vigorously defended the blackout; Commissioner Pete Rozelle regarded it as a bedrock of the league economy. Although the A.F.L. was more progressive in many ways than the older league that it merged with, it also believed in the blackout.
 Michael MacCambridge, the author of the book ''America's Game,'' a history of the N.F.L., said in an e-mail message that ''A.F.L. owners had survived the early '60s when crowds were relatively small, and they understandably viewed the home gate as their lifeblood, even when the TV money was growing.''
 The blackout policy was on the enemies list of one prominent fan: President Richard M. Nixon. His opposition led one of his former speechwriters, William Safire, to criticize him in his column in The New York Times. ''Even the president, who does not ordinarily favor government intrusion and economic controls,'' Safire wrote, ''has let his fervor as a fan outweigh his somewhat battered economic conservatism.''
 Congress overwhelmingly passed anti-blackout legislation in September 1973, forcing the league to alter the policy to the version that still exists: the home market is blacked out if the game is not sold out 72 hours before kickoff. The legislation expired in 1975, but the league has complied with it voluntarily ever since. 
 This season, amid fears that there could be as many as 50 blackouts because of slow ticket sales in some markets, there were 22, including seven apiece in Jacksonville, Fla., and Oakland, Calif., and four in Detroit.

HEADLINE: Filmmaker Seeks to Temper the Message of 'An Inconvenient Truth'

BYLINE: By MICHAEL CIEPLY

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
At the Sundance Film Festival four years ago, the global-warming debate took center stage with the premiere of an alarming work, the director Davis Guggenheim's documentary ''An Inconvenient Truth.''
 This year Ondi Timoner, a judge in the festival's United States documentaries competition -- in which Mr. Guggenheim's ''Waiting for Superman,'' about the failures of public education, is an entry -- is taking a break from a directing project of her own. Titled ''Cool It,'' Ms. Timoner's partly completed film, based on the work of the environmental writer Bjorn Lomborg, aims to quiet the global-warming alarm bells that Mr. Guggenheim and his narrator, Al Gore, set ringing.
 The documentary world, rife with impassioned advocacy, may now be poised for some genuine debate.
 By and large, the most prominent issues-oriented documentaries have leaned left, as filmmakers like Michael Moore (''Capitalism: A Love Story''), Alex Gibney (''Taxi to the Dark Side'') and Eugene Jarecki (''Why We Fight'') lined up behind progressive causes and points of view. 
 ''Historically, yes, that's the voice,'' said Deirdre Haj, who was recently named the executive director of Full Frame, an annual festival in Durham, N.C., devoted to documentaries.
 But if ''Cool It'' is now threatening to complicate the picture with an alternative and perhaps more conservative viewpoint, the festival circuit should ultimately embrace films like it, Ms. Haj said. That assumes that they are as effective, for instance, as Ms. Timoner's past documentary work, including ''Dig!,'' about the Dandy Warhols and the Brian Jonestown Massacre, and ''We Live in Public,'' about the Internet's impact on human interaction. Both films won major awards at Sundance.
 ''We should own that dialogue,'' Ms. Haj said.
 Alice Zou, a publicist for Mr. Guggenheim, said this week that he was not available to discuss Ms. Timoner's involvement with Mr. Lomborg on a film that challenges his own, or to say whether he thought she could judge ''Waiting for Superman'' fairly. In the festival's first major deal, ''Superman'' was acquired this week by Paramount Vantage, which distributed ''An Inconvenient Truth.''
 Ms. Timoner, about to leave Los Angeles for Park City, Utah, where the Sundance festival takes place, said she was a fan of Mr. Guggenheim's work, and looked forward to his new film. ''I hear it's wonderful,'' she said.
 ''Cool It,'' Ms. Timoner said, was intended not so much to correct ''An Inconvenient Truth,'' which raises the specter of devastation caused by climate change, as to temper its message with an appeal for practical solutions. Mr. Guggenheim's climate film left in its wake ''a certain amount of hysteria that is not realistic,'' Ms. Timoner said.
 That a Sundance award winner is making a movie that questions core assumptions of a festival hit -- ''An Inconvenient Truth'' went on to win an Oscar for best documentary feature, and took in $50 million at the worldwide box office -- is partly the work of Terry Botwick and Ralph Winter.
 The two are partners in a production company, 1019 Pictures, that is named for the longtime Beverly Hills street address of Mr. Botwick's mother-in-law, the singer Rosemary Clooney.
 Mr. Botwick has a history in television production, including years as a programming executive for the Family Channel. Mr. Winter, with a background in film production, made his mark as a producer of the ''X-Men'' films, including ''X-Men Origins: Wolverine.'' He is also a producer of religious-theme films like ''Left Behind: The Movie,'' which starred Kirk Cameron, and has served as a mentor for aspiring Christian screenwriters.
 After encountering Mr. Lomborg at a Los Angeles lecture in 2008, Mr. Botwick persuaded Mr. Winter to join him in producing a documentary that would advance that environmental writer's message.
 Mr. Lomborg has opposed demands for what he calls devastatingly expensive reductions in carbon emissions. He has also advocated an array of engineering feats and technological fixes to hedge against problems like rising sea levels in the short haul, and to make green energy an economically attractive alternative in the long run.
 Interviewing children in the slums of Kenya, Mr. Lomborg said he found that an almost universal dream among them was to own an automobile.
 ''They're not going to let go of that dream,'' Mr. Lomborg said in a telephone interview on Wednesday. ''We have to allow them good lives.''
 Ms. Timoner was not an obvious choice for a project that wades into the climate change debate. Her previous works are noted more for their intimacy than for their sweep. ''We Live in Public,'' for instance, chronicled an attempt by the Internet pioneer Josh Harris to live under 24-hour surveillance. 
 And by her own description, Ms. Timoner is a liberal Democrat who worked as a page for former Senator Tom Daschle, Democrat of South Dakota, and at 16 was happily photographed with Mr. Gore, then a Democratic senator from Tennessee.
 Still, Ms. Timoner said, an initial four-hour conversation with Mr. Lomborg left her convinced that Mr. Gore's bleak narrative in Mr. Guggenheim's documentary had overstated the immediacy of the global-warming threat, without proposing practical solutions. 
 ''If he were absolutely correct, we'd be frying on the sidewalk by now,'' she said.
 In search of solutions, Ms. Timoner has been shooting in various parts of the world, including low-lying cities like Rotterdam, the Netherlands, and New Orleans, and some of the poorer parts of Africa. She plans to finish with sequences about Mr. Lomborg's personal story, which has involved ferocious challenges to his academic work as a statistician in Denmark and his writings in books like ''The Skeptical Environmentalist,'' as well as validation by the likes of Time magazine, which named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world.
 Mr. Botwick and Mr. Winter said they expected ''Cool It'' to be ready by September, in time for the Toronto International Film Festival -- and also in time to provoke discussion in the fall's Congressional campaigns. ''Hopefully, we can stir the pot,'' Mr. Winter said.
 Reached by telephone on Wednesday, Lawrence Bender, a producer of ''An Inconvenient Truth,'' said he was not sufficiently familiar with the new project or with Mr. Lomborg's work to judge them.
 ''If it's something that's going to help us figure out how to combat global warming, I'm all for it,'' said Mr. Bender, who has helped lead a campaign to reduce carbon emissions by using energy-efficient fluorescent light bulbs.
 ''But if it's going to say carbon reduction isn't something we should do, they're working against the good of the whole world,'' he added. (Mr. Bender's latest documentary, ''Countdown to Zero,'' about nuclear arms proliferation, is showing at Sundance but is not in competition.)
 Ms. Timoner said she expected her documentary to end with a call to action -- though its proposals might not entirely please Mr. Bender. ''Changing a light bulb is not a plan,'' she said.

HEADLINE: They Still Don't Get It

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
How loud do the alarms have to get? There is an economic emergency in the country with millions upon millions of Americans riddled with fear and anxiety as they struggle with long-term joblessness, home foreclosures, personal bankruptcies and dwindling opportunities for themselves and their children.
 The door is being slammed on the American dream and the politicians, including the president and his Democratic allies on Capitol Hill, seem not just helpless to deal with the crisis, but completely out of touch with the hardships that have fallen on so many. 
 While the nation was suffering through the worst economy since the Depression, the Democrats wasted a year squabbling like unruly toddlers over health insurance legislation. No one in his or her right mind could have believed that a workable, efficient, cost-effective system could come out of the monstrously ugly plan that finally emerged from the Senate after long months of shady alliances, disgraceful back-room deals, outlandish payoffs and abject capitulation to the insurance companies and giant pharmaceutical outfits.
 The public interest? Forget about it.
 With the power elite consumed with its incessant, discordant fiddling over health care, the economic plight of ordinary Americans, from the middle class to the very poor, got pathetically short shrift. And there is no evidence, even now, that leaders of either party fully grasp the depth of the crisis, which began long before the official start of the Great Recession in December 2007.
 A new study from the Brookings Institution tells us that the largest and fastest-growing population of poor people in the U.S. is in the suburbs. You don't hear about this from the politicians who are always so anxious to tell you, in between fund-raisers and photo-ops, what a great job they're doing. From 2000 to 2008, the number of poor people in the U.S. grew by 5.2 million, reaching nearly 40 million. That represented an increase of 15.4 percent in the poor population, which was more than twice the increase in the population as a whole during that period.
 The study does not include data from 2009, when so many millions of families were just hammered by the recession. So the reality is worse than the Brookings figures would indicate. 
 Job losses, stagnant or reduced wages over the past decade, and the loss of home equity when the housing bubble burst have combined to take a horrendous toll on families who thought they had done all the right things and were living the dream. A great deal of that bleeding is in the suburbs. The study, compiled by the Brookings Metropolitan Policy Program, said, ''Suburbs gained more than 2.5 million poor individuals, accounting for almost half of the total increase in the nation's poor population since 2000.''
 Democrats in search of clues as to why voters are unhappy may want to take a look at the report. In 2008, a startling 91.6 million people -- more than 30 percent of the entire U.S. population -- fell below 200 percent of the federal poverty line, which is a meager $21,834 for a family of four.
 The question for Democrats is whether there is anything that will wake them up to their obligation to extend a powerful hand to ordinary Americans and help them take the government, including the Supreme Court, back from the big banks, the giant corporations and the myriad other predatory interests that put the value of a dollar high above the value of human beings.
 The Democrats still hold the presidency and large majorities in both houses of Congress. The idea that they are not spending every waking hour trying to fix the broken economic system and put suffering Americans back to work is beyond pathetic. Deficit reduction is now the mantra in Washington, which means that new large-scale investments in infrastructure and other measures to ease the employment crisis and jump-start the most promising industries of the 21st century are highly unlikely.
 What we'll get instead is rhetoric. It's cheap, so we can expect a lot of it.
 Those at the bottom of the economic heap seem all but doomed in this environment. The Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University in Boston put the matter in stark perspective after analyzing the employment challenges facing young people in Chicago: ''Labor market conditions for 16-19 and 20-24-year-olds in the city of Chicago in 2009 are the equivalent of a Great Depression-era, especially for young black men.''
 The Republican Party has abandoned any serious approach to the nation's biggest problems, economic or otherwise. It may be resurgent, but it's not a serious party. That leaves only the Democrats, a party that once championed working people and the poor, but has long since lost its way.

HEADLINE: Dealing With the Financial Burden of Autism

BYLINE: By WALECIA KONRAD

 BODY:
WHEN Jeff Sell's twin sons were found to have autism 13 years ago, he, like so many other parents in the same situation, found himself with a million questions: Will my children be able to function? What are the best treatments and where do I find them? How will this affect the rest of my family? 
 And besides those monumental worries, Mr. Sell kept asking himself another fundamental question as he began the long string of doctor and therapist visits with his sons: ''How in the world am I going to pay for all this?''
 Autism trends, treatments and therapies routinely make headlines. Often overlooked, though, is the financial burden for many families with autistic children. 
 Treatment is extremely expensive. Direct medical and nonmedical costs can add up to as much as $72,000 a year for someone with an extreme case of the disorder, and even $67,000 a year for those on the lower end of the spectrum, according to a study from the Harvard School of Public Health. 
 That figure includes medical costs like doctor visits, prescriptions and occupational and speech therapy, as well as expenses for things like special education, camps and child care, said Michael Ganz, the author of the study, who is now a health care consultant. 
 ''It can cost $3.2 million to take care of an autistic person over the course of his or her lifetime,'' the study said.
 More families are grappling with the disorder than ever before. One of every 110 8-year-old children in the United States has been diagnosed with autism -- and one of every 70 boys, according to the latest survey from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, released last fall. That is up from one in 150 children in a comparable report released in 2007. 
 ''The numbers are just amazing,'' said Pat Kemp, executive vice president of the advocacy group Autism Speaks, ''Unless we attack this like a national health crisis, we're going to have a huge economic crisis on our hands.'' 
 Certainly families feel the financial strain. Many health insurance policies do not cover autism treatments, while those that do often have severe limits. And there is very little government or private financial assistance available. 
 In many cases these children will need assistance all their lives, Mr. Ganz points out. Making sure there is money for the future is something else parents worry about. 
 When his sons received their diagnosis, Mr. Sell was practicing personal-injury law in Texas, and he began paying for many of their treatments from his own income and savings. In 2005, as he became more involved in autism issues, he joined the staff of the Autism Society of America in Bethesda, Md., where he is now a vice president.
 His sons are now 15. One, Joe, is talkative and considered ''high functioning.'' The other, Ben, is nonverbal with profound autism. 
 ''What works for one child doesn't necessarily work for the other,'' Mr. Sell said. ''So we're talking about finding and paying for twice as many treatments.'' 
 In the early years, the Sell family had some autism coverage under Mr. Sell's health insurance. But claims for certain therapies, tests and treatments were often denied. ''I was very aggressive about appealing those denials, and I often won,'' Mr. Sell said. 
 But even with coverage, Mr. Sell found he needed to pay enormous amounts out of pocket to come close to giving his sons the 20 to 40 hours of behavioral therapies each week that were often recommended. (Eventually, as discussed below, Mr. Sell was also able to obtain financial assistance through a special part of the Medicaid program.) 
 Although direct financial support may be scarce and hard to obtain, there are several autism information and advocacy groups that routinely help parents navigate financial hurdles. Here is a road map parents can use to get started. 
 CHECK YOUR INSURANCE Coverage for autism treatments is still far from common, but it is improving. Some large employers offer policies that cover treatment, and 15 states have passed laws mandating at least some autism-related coverage. The Autism Society's Web site lists the relevant states. (That section of the site is still under construction, but you can scroll down to see the states.)
 In addition, Maine and New Hampshire both have legislation pending that could pass soon, Mr. Kemp said. 
 If you do have coverage, watch for limitations. Because treatment for autism is so individualized, there are few uniform standards or protocols for insurance companies to follow. That means parents often have to argue that a certain therapy or treatment is necessary. Also, be sure to check any caps on treatment, Mr. Sell warns. What may look generous -- say $36,000 a year -- can be spent quickly. Or there may be limits on how many sessions of a particular type of therapy will be paid for each year. 
 And you will want to coordinate your insurance coverage with the services you may be receiving from your child's school. If an occupational therapist sees your child regularly in school, for example, you may want to save your insurance dollars for social interaction therapies. 
 In addition, you may need to be especially aggressive about coverage for some medical conditions. Gastrointestinal problems, for instance, are extremely common in autistic children. 
 Mr. Sell found himself fighting for such coverage for Ben, his nonverbal son. The insurance company had denied the claim for gastrointestinal testing, saying that because Ben's behavior problems were related to autism, the testing was not covered. 
 Mr. Sell, convinced Ben was in pain and could not tell anyone what was wrong, appealed and won. The tests showed that Ben had ulcers and lower-intestine problems that still occasionally flare up and require treatment. 
 MEDICAID WAIVERS Some states offer Medicaid coverage for children with autism without taking the family's income into account -- only the child's diagnosis. This is usually reserved for fairly serious cases but is worth exploring, Mr. Sell said. 
 ''This was a godsend for us,'' he said. The waiver, he said, allows families access to services that private insurance won't cover and that they wouldn't be able to afford otherwise. 
 With the waiver, Mr. Sell was able to get more home-based speech and occupational therapies for his sons to supplement the sessions they receive at the public school they both attend. Medicaid also covers recreational therapy during which a specialist takes Ben and Joe on hikes and other outings, giving the parents some downtime. 
 To see if your child is eligible for a Medicaid waiver, go to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Web site and click on your state. 
 Because Medicaid is one of the few government lifelines available, waiting lists for waivers can be extremely long. Mr. Sell, for example, waited nine years to get waivers for his sons. 
 ''Just go ahead and get on the list and try not to be too discouraged,'' advised Mr. Sell. ''Many states are moving faster now.'' 
 GO LOCAL Many autism advocacy organizations, including Autism Speaks and the Autism Society of America, are affiliated with local chapters throughout the country. In addition, most states, counties, towns and cities provide lists of local autism resources and support groups. 
 It is people in the local groups who will know all the resources available. They can also help you keep up with the latest research, so you don't spend time and money chasing the many unsubstantiated ''cures'' out there. They will also have lots of practical advice, like which dentists, optometrists and even barbers are good with autistic children. 
 ''You think going to the barber is no big deal?'' Mr. Sell asked. ''Just try it with an autistic child.'' 
 OTHER RESOURCES A handful of organizations like Easter Seals and the National Autism Association offer financial help to struggling families. Autism Family Resources and United Healthcare Children's Foundation also offer grants to pay for autism treatments.

HEADLINE: Jobless Rates Rose In 43 States Last Month

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Unemployment rates rose in 43 states last month, the government said Friday, painting a bleak picture of the job market and illustrating nationwide data released two weeks ago. The rise in joblessness was a sharp change from November, when 36 states said their unemployment rates fell. Four states -- Delaware, Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina -- reported record-high jobless rates in December. New Jersey's rate rose to a 33-year high of 10.1 percent while New York's reached a 26-year high of 9 percent. Analysts said the report showed the economy is recovering at too weak a pace to generate consistent job creation.

HEADLINE: Debt Burden Now Rests More on U.S. Shoulders

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and economics in his blog at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
THE United States government borrowed more money than ever before in 2009, but its largest lender -- China -- sharply reduced the amount it was willing to lend. 
 The United States Treasury estimated this week that during the first 11 months of last year China raised its holdings of Treasury securities by just $62 billion. That was less than 5 percent of the money the Treasury had to raise.
 That raised its holdings to $790 billion, leaving it the largest foreign holder of Treasury securities -- Japan is second at $757 billion and Britain a distant third at $278 billion. But China's holdings at the end of November were lower than they were at the end of July.
 Not since 2001, when China was still a relatively minor investor in Treasury securities, had the country shown a decline in holdings over a six-month period.
 During the full year of 2009, the volume of outstanding Treasury securities owned by the public -- as opposed to United States government agencies like the Federal Reserve or the Social Security Administration -- rose by $1.4 trillion, a 23 percent gain, to $7.8 trillion. In dollar terms, that was the largest annual increase ever, but as a percentage increase it slightly trailed 2008.
 With this week's release of the November estimate of foreign holdings, China is on course to lend just 4.6 percent of the money the government raised during the year. That compared with 20.2 percent in 2008 and a peak of 47.4 percent in 2006.
 The falloff in Chinese purchases did not necessarily cost the American government a lot of money, as interest rates did not soar during the year. Short-term rates actually fell. The yield on 10-year Treasuries rose to 3.6 percent, from 2.2 percent, a substantial increase but still a low rate by historical standards.
 Some economists have feared what could happen if China ever decided to unload the Treasury securities it owns, but the reduction of Chinese purchases probably did not result from any decision to do that, said Robert Barbera, the chief economist of ITG, an investment advisory firm.
 Instead, he said, China's main determination now was to prevent the rise of its currency against the dollar, and the country needed to buy fewer dollar-denominated securities to accomplish that goal, as the Chinese trade surplus with the United States declined.
 The figures on foreign holdings estimated by the Treasury Department include both official and private holdings. In China, that is mostly official, but in some other countries many of the holdings are owned by investors or money managers who could be managing portfolios on behalf of people from yet another country. It is possible that some Chinese purchases appear to be from other countries.
 Other countries took up part of the slack left by the reduction in China's purchases. Hong Kong, which is counted separately, took up more than 5 percent of the increased borrowing by the American government, and Japan provided nearly 10 percent. 
 But total foreign purchases in the 11 months financed only 39 percent of the borrowing, leaving American investors to purchase the remainder. As recently as 2007, foreigners were buying more Treasuries than the government was issuing, enabling Americans to reduce their Treasury holdings even as the government borrowed hundreds of billions of dollars.

HEADLINE: A Stubborn Problem

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
Here's what has not changed about the health care system in America.
 According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, by 2019 there will be 54 million people in the United States without health insurance. The chief actuary of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services says it will be even worse: 57 million people without insurance. 
 In 2017, just seven years from now, the Medicare hospital insurance trust fund will be exhausted. Empty. 
 Total national expenditures on health care will continue to soar, according to the chief actuary, to $4.7 trillion in 2019 from $2.6 trillion today.
 The average cost of an employer-sponsored family health insurance policy will rise to $20,300 in 2019, or about $10,000 more than today, consuming an ever-growing portion of family income and continuing to put downward pressure on wages.
 The results of the special election in Massachusetts may have permanently shifted the health care debate, but the inescapable reality facing both Democrats and Republicans is that the steep rise in the cost of health care is the single biggest threat to the nation's economic security that policy makers can both predict and, to some degree, control.
 Democrats and Republicans alike say they want to fix the problem. 
 But even some lawmakers who seemed intent on addressing the issues are now wavering. Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine, for instance, has said there is little choice but to start over and think smaller.
 Two men in Congress with the knowledge and expertise to lead the way on a compromise are Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, and Senator Michael B. Enzi, Republican of Wyoming, who spent months working on the health bill as part of a bipartisan group in the Senate.
 But Mr. Grassley is up for re-election this year, and in any event it is not clear that the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, sees any political advantage in letting Mr. Grassley and Mr. Enzi proceed with any sort of comprehensive proposal.
 At the same time, Democrats are looking to Mr. Obama to call the next play, and he is likely to do so during his first State of the Union speech. At a town-hall-style meeting on Friday, Mr. Obama may have offered an early preview of his strategy. ''This is our best chance to do it,'' he told the crowd. ''We can't keep on putting this off.''

HEADLINE: Chairman in House Proposes Replacing Freddie and Fannie

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Barney Frank, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, called Friday for a new system for providing money for home loans and the elimination of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 
 ''I believe this committee will be recommending abolishing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in their current form and coming up with a whole new system of housing finance,'' Mr. Frank said at a hearing on executive compensation issues. ''That's the approach, rather than the piecemeal one.''
 His comments show how much the financial crisis has upended the relationship between lawmakers and the two companies. Mr. Frank, a Democrat from Massachusetts, was long one of the staunchest supporters of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
 The two companies, which have been run by the government since they almost collapsed in September 2008, have been kept afloat with $112 billion in federal aid. Late last year, the Obama administration pledged to cover unlimited losses through 2012 for both companies, lifting an earlier cap of $400 billion.
 Regulators announced last month that the chief executives of Fannie and Freddie could be paid as much as $6 million for 2009. That has outraged Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill.
 ''We are paying these people bonuses to lose tens of billions of dollars,'' said Representative Jeb Hensarling, a Republican from Texas, at Friday's hearing. ''What people do with their money is their business. What they do with the taxpayer money is our business.''
 Fannie Mae, based in Washington, and Freddie Mac, based in McLean, Va., provide cash to the mortgage industry by buying home loans from lenders and selling them to investors. 
 Together, they own or guarantee almost 31 million home loans worth about $5.5 trillion, or about half of all mortgages in the United States.
 Shares of both companies sank on the news. Fannie Mae closed at 99 cents, down 7.5 percent. Freddie Mac closed at $1.17, down 10.7 percent, but added a penny in after-hours trading.

HEADLINE: Bernanke's Bid For a 2nd Term Hits Resistance

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
The Obama administration struggled on Friday to secure confirmation of Ben S. Bernanke to a second term as chairman of the Federal Reserve, underscoring the political upheaval as both parties tried to find their footing amid a powerful wave of populism.
 Two Democratic senators who are up for re-election this year announced that they would oppose Mr. Bernanke, whose four-year term as head of the central bank expires at the end of this month. Their decisions reflected a surge of opposition among some Democrats and Republicans to Mr. Bernanke, a primary architect of the bailout of the financial system and a contributor to policies that critics contend put the economy at risk in the first place. 
 With no vote scheduled and Capitol Hill abuzz with the possibility that more senators would use the nomination to show voters they understood the anger about bailouts and economic hardship, the uncertainty about Mr. Bernanke's fate spread to Wall Street. 
 It contributed to another day of losses for investors at the end of a three-day slide that drove the markets down almost 5 percent. The Dow ended the week at its lowest close since early November. 
 By the end of the day, the White House had extracted a statement of support for Mr. Bernanke from the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, who had been noncommittal. Mr. Reid's statement, issued after the markets closed, was intended to signal that Democrats, backed by some Republicans, could come up with the 60 votes necessary to break a deadlock and reconfirm Mr. Bernanke.
 But even then Mr. Reid's statement was remarkably unenthusiastic. After meeting with Mr. Bernanke on Thursday, Mr. Reid warned: ''The American people expect our economic leaders to keep Wall Street honest and level the playing field for middle-class families.'' 
 And in his statement Friday, Mr. Reid said he had decided to support Mr. Bernanke with trepidation and only after he received a commitment that the Fed chairman would take additional steps to increase the flow of credit to middle-class Americans.
 While some Republicans were certain to oppose Mr. Bernanke, the minority leadership had its own strategic calculations to make. 
 Rejecting Mr. Bernanke, a Republican economist who was named chairman by President George W. Bush in 2005 and took over in 2006, could lead Mr. Obama to appoint someone from the ranks of Democratic economists that Republican lawmakers find less appealing. And if markets swooned, Republicans would share in the blame. 
 But even if the nomination is approved, the spasm of anxiety surrounding it will have highlighted how members of both parties are reassessing their stands on many issues as they try to understand the strain of anger toward the government, Wall Street and other institutions. 
 In the days since the Democrats lost a crucial Senate seat in Massachusetts, Mr. Obama has struck a tougher tone toward big banks. In the process he signaled a shift away from less aggressive regulatory policies backed by another architect of the bailout, Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary. On Friday in Ohio, Mr. Obama took a combative approach on health care reform and banking regulation.
 But Mr. Obama cannot afford a failed nomination -- the Senate has never before rejected a president's nominee for Fed chairman -- and he has publicly and privately backed Mr. Bernanke and Mr. Geithner for their roles in stabilizing the financial system and averting what could have been a wholesale collapse. 
 Opposition to Mr. Bernanke has emerged from both the left and the right, as anger has mounted over the Fed's extraordinary interventions in the market in 2008 -- which have been lumped together with the huge bailouts of big financial institutions -- and over its regulatory failings before the crisis. Mr. Bernanke has also been criticized for backing an easy money policy earlier in the decade that critics say fueled the housing bubble. 
 ''The anger at the Treasury has been spilling over to the Fed,'' said Frederic S. Mishkin, a former member of the Fed's board of governors and a close friend of Mr. Bernanke. 
 ''My view is Chairman Bernanke helped save the world from depression,'' said Mr. Mishkin, an economist at Columbia University. ''Whether you agree with every policy he's pursued or some of the ways the bailouts were done, the outcome here, given the severity of the shock, is a good one. But that's hard to explain to the American public when we're sitting with 10 percent unemployment.''
 The two Democratic senators to come out against Mr. Bernanke on Friday, Barbara Boxer of California and Russell D. Feingold of Wisconsin, called for a chairman more attuned to the suffering of ordinary Americans.
 ''It is time for Main Street to have a champion at the Fed,'' Ms. Boxer said. ''Our next Federal Reserve chairman must represent a clean break from the failed policies of the past.''
 Mr. Feingold was unsparing in his criticism: ''Under the watch of Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve permitted grossly irresponsible financial activities that led to the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.'' 
 By day's end, other Democratic senators had rallied around Mr. Bernanke. Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, the chairman of the Banking Committee, warned that a no vote would ''send the worst signal to the markets right now in the country and send us in a tailspin.''
 Senator Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana announced qualified support, saying that ''failing to reappoint Mr. Bernanke would only add turmoil to markets that are just beginning to recover.''
 The White House chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, and Secretary Geithner were both making calls to senators on Mr. Bernanke's behalf, administration officials said.
 At least 11 senators have said they would oppose Mr. Bernanke, including four Democrats, Ms. Boxer, Mr. Feingold, Byron L. Dorgan of North Dakota and Jeff Merkley of Oregon; one independent, Bernie Sanders of Vermont; and six Republicans. 
 ''Especially since the election in Massachusetts, Democrats are waking up to the fact that Americans are profoundly disgusted with the behavior on Wall Street that led to the disaster we're currently in,'' Mr. Sanders said. ''In the last week the president has decidedly changed his tone on Wall Street -- in my view, quite appropriately. He would be well served to have an ally at the Fed who shares those concerns.''
 Senate Democratic leaders had contemplated a vote this week on the nomination, but were forced to hold off after encountering opposition at their caucus's weekly luncheon on Wednesday. The leaders asked for a show of hands and, though aides would not provide a precise count, Mr. Reid was said to be surprised at the number.
 And in a sign of such uncertainty, Mr. Reid asked the minority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, to count the votes on the Republican side. Mr. McConnell has not said how he will vote, but some influential Republican senators, including Judd Gregg of New Hampshire and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, have said they will back Mr. Bernanke.
 If Mr. Bernanke's term as chairman expires, he would still remain a member of the board of governors, where he holds a separate 14-year appointment that does not expire until 2020. It is also possible he could continue on as chairman pro tempore. The Federal Reserve Act states that the vice chairman -- Donald L. Kohn now -- acts as chairman in the chairman's absence, but how an absence is defined is not clear.

HEADLINE: Here's How to Help

 BODY:
President Obama promised this week to reconnect to the concerns and needs of Americans who are suffering from the recession. One important way to do that is to help hard-pressed families hang on to their homes. 
 It's not just the moral thing to do. It also would help avoid the spillover effects of the next expected round of defaults. Coupled with high unemployment, a coming surge in foreclosures is likely to further depress house prices. That would hurt an already fragile recovery and, in a worst case, could provoke a double-dip recession.
 Unfortunately, advance word of coming changes to the antiforeclosure effort are not encouraging. 
 When the effort was announced nearly a year ago, the administration said it would help as many as nine million at-risk families keep their homes by the end of 2012 -- by lower payments through loan modifications, mainly lower interest rates, or by refinancing loans for borrowers who have little or no equity.
 Yet recent tallies show that through 2009, only 66,465 loans had been successfully modified, and through last November, 155,700 loans had been refinanced. That's abysmal. An estimated 2.4 million borrowers are expected to lose their homes this year alone because of joblessness, negative equity and, in many cases, unaffordability as teaser rates expire on adjustable mortgages. 
 It would take 100,000 successful modifications a month, starting now, to significantly counter the threat that so many foreclosures would pose to the economy, according to estimates by Moody's Economy.com. 
 As early as next week, the administration is expected to ease up on the paperwork requirements for a loan modification and to announce temporary assistance -- probably low-cost loans or grants -- to help unemployed people pay their mortgages. A loan would likely be tacked on to the mortgage, for repayment over time.
 Those changes, however, would not correct the program's biggest flaw: the current preferred way to modify a loan -- reducing the interest rate -- is of limited use to millions of so-called underwater borrowers, those who owe more than their homes are worth. Reducing the loan's principal balance is more valuable because it lowers monthly payments and restores equity. Various studies show that having equity also reduces the likelihood of redefault on a modified loan. 
 Administration officials, however, have been unwilling or unable to persuade lenders to reduce the principal on underwater loans. One obstacle is that many troubled borrowers have two loans on their home, and conflicts exist between the first and second mortgage holders over who gets how much out of a loan whose principal has been cut. Several months ago, the Treasury Department detailed a plan aimed at resolving the conflicts, but lenders have yet to cooperate. 
 It is less clear why the refinancing arm of the antiforeclosure program has flopped. But for many borrowers, refinancing may not be worth the cost unless mortgage rates drop and stay low, which is not likely.
 Treasury officials say that they continually review the antiforeclosure effort and consider changes. It's hard to see what they need to convince them that it's time to restore some equity to drowning borrowers.

HEADLINE: Mobs Rule

BYLINE: By CHARLES M. BLOW

 BODY:
Welcome to the mob: an angry, wounded electorate, riled by recession, careening across the political spectrum, still craving change, nursing a bloodlust.
 There is a scene in the movie ''Gladiator'' where two Roman senators are discussing the games that the emperor has revived. One laments: I think the emperor ''knows what Rome is. Rome is the mob. Conjure magic for them and they'll be distracted. Take away their freedom and still they'll roar. The beating heart of Rome is not the marble of the senate. It's the sand of the coliseum. He'll bring them death. And they will love him for it.'' 
 That was America during the dawn of W. -- too many too easily manipulated. But people grew wiser and restless. And they revolted. As they did, a young crowd-pleaser in Chicago, cloaked in hope, sprang up, won them over and shaped the mob into a movement. 
 That was then.
 Unfortunately, many now see Barack Obama as a left-leaning version of George W. Bush: just another out-of-touch emperor. It seems as if Obama and the Democrats made the mistake of believing that a heart once won was forever won, that people would be patient, and that the mob would accept their reasoning for lack of results.
 They were wrong. The mob is fickle. And it's back with a vengeance.
 While the left slept, the right saw a void and leapt in. They feted the fearful to a steady stream of dread and circuses, and now the pendulum of enthusiasm has swung in the other direction. 
 According to an NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey conducted last week, the percentage of people who view President Obama ''very negatively'' has more than doubled since he was elected. Over the same time period, the number of those who view the Democratic Party ''very negatively'' has increased by three-quarters, while the number of those viewing the Republican Party ''very negatively'' has dropped slightly.
 The most recent manifestation of the shifting landscape is the election of Scott Brown, a Republican in reliably Democratic Massachusetts, which shattered the Democrats' filibuster-proof Senate majority and their sense of security. 
 In an interview with George Stephanopoulos of ABC News this week, Obama acknowledged as much: ''The same thing that swept Scott Brown into office swept me into office. People are angry, and they're frustrated.'' 
 It's smart to acknowledge this, but can he get out in front of it?
 Obama continued, ''If there's one thing that I regret this year, is that we were so busy just getting stuff done and dealing with the immediate crises that were in front of us, that I think we lost some of that sense of speaking directly to the American people about what their core values are.'' 
 He underestimated the mob, and his agenda will suffer now that the emperor has no cloture.

HEADLINE: The Bottom Line: Why Paterson's Anti-Obesity Soda Tax Might Drive Some to Drink

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
Let them drink beer.
 It does not have the je ne sais quoi of the infamous words that Marie Antoinette apparently never spoke (that is another story). But Nelson Eusebio says it is the message that Gov. David A. Paterson is sending with his proposed penny-an-ounce tax on soft drinks made with sugar. 
 Mr. Eusebio wears two hats, both firmly cocked against a soft-drink tax. He is the chairman of New Yorkers Against Unfair Taxes, which describes itself as a coalition that opposes ''unfair and misdirected beverage tax increases.'' Its members include soft-drink bottling companies, vending machine trade groups and supermarket chains. He is also the executive director of the National Supermarket Association, which represents more than 400 supermarkets in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.
 While the governor is taking aim at obesity, to which sugary drinks contribute, Mr. Eusebio worries that the proposed tax would slim down the beverage industry, which he said pays $6.7 billion in wages statewide and generates billions more for the economy.
 But he also mentioned some far smaller numbers that startled a soft-drink drinker. 
 ''A six-pack of soda is going to cost you approximately $4.99'' if the penny-an-ounce tax goes through, Mr. Eusebio said, ''where you can pick up beer from $2.99 to $3.99.''
 Off to the neighborhood supermarket, where it turned out that Mr. Eusebio's math was not far off. With the tax, a six-pack of Coca-Cola or Pepsi would cost 2 cents more than a six-pack of the cheapest beer in the store.
 The store was the Pioneer supermarket at 289 Columbus Avenue, at West 74th Street. Near the front door is a sign promoting its reputation as a beer connoisseur's paradise. The sign quotes Good Housekeeping magazine, which mentioned the store's beer inventory back in 1986.
 Its coolers are still crammed. It sells four brands of beer for $5.29 a six-pack: Old Milwaukee, Schaefer, Schlitz and Pabst. (Old Milwaukee's nonalcoholic malt beverage also costs $5.29.)
 A six-pack of Coca-Cola -- in 12-ounce cans -- costs $4.59. The governor's proposed tax would add 72 cents, bringing the price to $5.31, or 2 cents more than the beer. Of course, the state's 5-cent-a-can container tax adds another 30 cents to the beer and the soda.
 The store manager, Anthony Scerri, said he was not much of a soda drinker (though he is partial to rum-and-Cokes). But he said a soda tax would cause headaches and disagreements with customers at the checkout lanes.
 ''It's just another nuisance tax,'' he said. ''It's an imposition. Why should you be taxed on something you like?''

HEADLINE: A Weekend to Deal With Ifs, Ands and Buts

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and economics in his blog at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
People on Wall Street are in a state of shock today. It shows in the stock market, which is down 5 percent in three days.
 The last time the market went down that fast, it was hitting bottom in March. But this feels very different from that.
 Until now, it appeared that the big banks, having been rescued, could go on more or less as always. The argument that really hurting the banks would cause too much damage to the economy had been persuasive at the top levels of the Obama administration. 
 Congress -- especially freshman Democrats from Republican-leaning districts who did not want to appear to be antibusiness -- seemed willing to back the banks on the kinds of details of regulatory reform that few voters understand.
 The administration's regulatory proposals, by no means hostile to the banks but including some real changes, were being quietly amended to take out a lot of the teeth. Paul A. Volcker, who wanted to scale back bank trading activities, was the odd man out among President Obama's advisers.
 Then came Massachusetts, and the interpretation that the Democratic Senate candidate was defeated in large part because of populist anger.
 The first shock for Wall Street was the president's sudden conversion to Volckerism. But that seemed to be spent by Friday morning. At 11 a.m., the Dow Jones industrial average was virtually unchanged from Thursday.
 Then came reports that Ben S. Bernanke's renomination as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board might be in trouble. That is something that nobody on Wall Street had thought possible. Stocks plunged again.
 Who would we get if Mr. Bernanke were forced to step aside? Who would the Senate confirm? What promises might it extract from a new chairman, and would those promises severely restrict the independence of the Fed? Nobody knows.
 This is going to be a very interesting weekend. Back in 1987, a stock market shock on Friday turned into a crash on Monday in part because the Sunday morning talk shows heard an administration official picking fights with Europe. For whomever goes on the shows this weekend, it will be difficult to sound the right notes to pacify the public anger without totally scaring investors, both in the United States and abroad.
 Until now, the consensus conventional wisdom went something like this: The banks deserve worse than they are getting, but the rest of us would suffer too much if they got it. So we bailed them out, and did not force bank shareholders to lose everything, or bank creditors to take large losses.
 That wisdom may still be correct. But it may not matter. If people are angry enough, they may want to damage the bankers and then figure out what to do to get over the problems that causes.
 Could this have been avoided? Yes it could. If.
 If the Fed had shown a lot more contrition for its errors of monetary policy and regulation.
 If the banks had shown similar contrition, and accepted the idea that people who -- as a group -- almost sank the financial system did not deserve to return quickly to mega bonuses.
 If Goldman Sachs, in particular, did not insist that it never needed a bailout and was never in danger of collapse.
 If the Obama administration had chosen to exclude people with ties to the past errors.
 Since that March bottom in stocks, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is up 61 percent, even after the sell-off this week. Junk bonds, as shown by the Merrill Lynch High Yield index, have done even better. And the leading index of financial stocks is still more than twice as high as it was in March.
 Those soaring prices came as people concluded that fears of Great Depression II were overdone, and that the economy would recover.
 The events of this week have called into question many of the assumptions that lay behind that conclusion -- assumptions about regulatory policies and monetary policy, as well as the assumptions about who would be leading Obama administration policy.
 The events have not proven any of the assumptions wrong, but it may be worth remembering that the stock market rose before any economic improvement was visible. It may also decline before there is proof that the new populist fervor will cause serious damage.

HEADLINE: Depth of School Cuts Depends on Who Gets Them

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

DATELINE: ALBANY 

 BODY:
When Gov. David A. Paterson proposed this week cutting more than $1 billion in school aid to help address the state's financial crisis, the critics quickly pounced. Mr. Paterson's cuts would cripple New York's schools, they charged, hurt children and undermine the state's economic recovery.
 ''The governor's proposal in essence pries open our schoolhouse doors and extracts every dollar from children's education that Albany can put its hands on,'' Billy Easton, the executive director for the Alliance for Quality Education, said in one widely quoted statement. 
 But looked at more closely, Mr. Paterson's cuts -- likely to be the most bitterly fought-over, most fiercely resisted portion of his budget plan -- may not be quite as dire as some education advocates make them appear.
 The discrepancy between rhetoric and reality is clearest when it comes to the state's wealthier and more politically connected school districts, especially on Long Island and in Westchester County, where suburban lawmakers have long flexed their muscle to ensure that their districts receive a disproportionate share of state money. Wealthy districts have also piled up significant cash reserves in so-called undesignated accounts, to be used for emergencies. 
 All told, the state's 50 richest districts have about $100 million in such reserves, according to state budget officials. Their total combined cut under Mr. Paterson's plan: $12.6 million.
 The state's most affluent district, the Bridgehampton School District on Long Island, would have its state aid reduced under Mr. Paterson's plan by 24 percent, a striking cut in percentage terms. In dollars, however, that comes to $170,588 -- 1.7 percent of the district's annual budget.
 But in politics, few cows are more sacred than schools, and that is especially true in Albany, where school spending has largely escaped the budget ax until now. Mr. Paterson's last budget essentially froze state school aid, while sharply cutting the health care budget, the other big pot of state spending. New York spends about $15,500 per pupil every year, second only to New Jersey, and nearly $6,000 more than the national average. 
 Though Mr. Paterson's proposed education cuts this year would be the largest year-to-year cuts in at least two decades, those cuts amount to just 5 percent of the money Albany sent to schools last year. And because schools get most of their money from local property taxes, the actual effect on each district's bottom line is even less than that. Under Mr. Paterson's proposal, amid the worst financial crisis in generations, school districts would have to give up about 2 percent of their budgets on average.
 Statewide, according to an analysis by the Citizens Budget Commission, a business-backed group that generally favors lower spending, the cuts work out to roughly $160 per pupil. ''It seems to be a reasonable request at this point in time,'' said Elizabeth Lynam, the commission's deputy research director.
 Of course, not all school districts are created equal. Even after a 2006 court decision that mandated more state money be devoted to historically shortchanged schools in New York City, suburban lawmakers made sure that each region's share of state aid remained unchanged. 
 To balance that, Mr. Paterson has proposed progressive cuts, with poorer school districts taking a significantly smaller percentage hit than larger ones. Still, Mr. Easton and other advocates say any cuts are damaging, especially to poorer districts, which rely on the state for a much greater share of their budgets than rich ones.
 ''If you take a poor school district where students are already lacking challenging curricula that they need to raise their graduation rates, instead of moving forward, you're going to move backward,'' Mr. Easton said. ''When programs are cut, it's going to be the margin of difference for individual children between success and failure, between mediocrity and excellence.''
 But are the cuts catastrophic? The Salmon River district in Franklin County, the state's poorest school district, is getting extra state money this year for capital expenses, so the district's total education aid will actually rise 4 percent. 
 Even absent that bump, however, the district would be forced to cut only 3 percent of its total budget under the governor's proposal.
 ''Each district's situation is going to be different,'' Ms. Lynam said. ''But it seems like there ought to be room to be able to withstand that without too much panic. There's no way to balance the budget and not address schools.''
 Still, districts do face financial challenges. Because the state pension fund lost so much money when the stock market crashed in 2008, school districts and municipalities are being required to pay significantly higher pension contributions. And union contracts give officials little authority to cut salaries or benefits.
 Jane Collins, the school superintendent in Salmon River, pointed out that the district relies on the federal and state governments for 95 percent of its budget. The loss of any aid, she said, affects ''students in my districts harder than it does other students in other districts. It's not fair and it's not right.'' 
 School officials also argue that they should not tap into their reserves to cover operating expenses, a step Mr. Paterson himself has avoided taking with the state's own reserves. They fear endangering their bond ratings or being caught unprepared for unexpected expenses. Many are bracing themselves for next year, when they will run out of education aid distributed through the federal stimulus bill.
 ''You can legally tap into it, but you'd be a fool to do it,'' said William H. Johnson, superintendent of the Rockville Centre school district in Nassau County. ''You have expenses every year you can't anticipate. A single child moving into the district who requires a special education placement could cost us over $100,000.''
 But Mr. Paterson and his aides point out that most districts could cover the cuts with only a relatively small portion of their reserves. 
 ''We believe that the vast majority of school districts should be able to manage this reduction without adversely impacting property taxpayers or educational quality,'' said Matt Anderson, a spokesman for Mr. Paterson. ''The reduction was targeted progressively based on district wealth and student need, represents a relatively small percentage of overall district budgets, and came after years of rapid state funding increases that far outpaced the rate of inflation.''

HEADLINE: Hopes Rest on Comeback By a Rejuvenated Cohen

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN

DATELINE: SPOKANE, Wash. 

 BODY:
Desperate to restore a pulse to a flatlining sport, U.S. Figure Skating and NBC built their promotions for the national championships around the resuscitation of Sasha Cohen.
 It might have seemed a curious strategy, considering that Cohen, 25, had not performed in Olympic-style competitions in four years. On the other hand, she might be the only current American skater whom most people could name without a program or a Twitter message from Dick Button.
 So far, the approach has been prescient, even if the scheduling has been awkward. 
 In her return to Olympic-style skating after taking a silver medal at the 2006 Winter Games in Turin, Italy, Cohen finished second to Mirai Nagasu in the short program late Thursday night. Two American women will qualify for the Vancouver Olympics next month.
 ''I wasn't quite ready to say goodbye,'' Cohen said.
 Oddly, though, after promoting Cohen so heavily, NBC and the skating federation made it difficult to watch her perform or read about it in the morning paper. It is a curious way to elevate a sport, having the short program end at 2 a.m. Eastern time. Even Michelle Kwan, who is in graduate school at Tufts in the Boston suburbs, texted a friend to say she could not stay awake to watch.
 What Kwan and others missed was a restorative effort from Cohen, who struggled with tendinitis in her calf through the fall and early winter, withdrawing from two Grand Prix events. Only in the last two or three weeks did she grow confident and fit enough to compete at these championships.
 ''She's very deceptive,'' said John Nicks, Cohen's longtime coach. ''She looks like a petite little China doll, but you've got a very tough young lady there. She had some very bad falls, some very hurtful falls, and got up like it was nothing and did it again and fell again and got up.''
 During Thursday's warm-ups, Cohen fell on a double axel, but righted herself as she began to skate to a Pasodoble tempo. She took off on the wrong -- inside -- edge on her triple lutz and landed shakily on a double toe, then settled down and drew the crowd into her enchanting grasp.
 Since the 2006 Olympics, Cohen has been touring as a show skater. That, along with her age, has given her a presence, refined artistry and maturity that many younger performers still lack. Rachael Flatt, 17, uses pep to disguise her lack of speed and artistry. Nagasu, 16, jumped and spun mesmerizingly Thursday, but she is still given to bouts of crying and lapses of self-assurance.
 ''It's women and girls,'' Scott Hamilton, the 1984 Olympic champion, said of the difference between Cohen and her competitors. ''I don't want it to sound cruel. But what she has is a maturity and a confidence that other skaters are acquiring.''
 According to rules of the skating federation, Cohen could still make the Olympic team without finishing among the top two after Saturday's long program. Such a decision might be tempting, given her achievement and reputation, but Nicks said he thought it would be ''very unusual'' to pick anyone who did not finish first or second.
 And there is no guarantee that Cohen will remain composed.
 She is a renowned short program skater who has often become distracted during the long program. Never has she skated two clean performances in the same competition. And it remains to be seen whether she still has the endurance for a demanding, four-minute routine.
 As Nicks said, Thursday was a start but only a start. Linda Leaver, who coached Brian Boitano, said that returning to competition is like ''being thrown into a cold shower.''
 ''On tour, you still have your job; the next night you get another chance,'' Leaver said. ''In this, you don't get another chance.''
 At 25, Cohen said she felt wiser. Her upper body is also rippling with muscle, which presumably helps her jump and spin more powerfully.
 ''One of my friends said, You need to be lighter, faster, stronger and have better endurance than you ever did before,'' Cohen said. ''I was like, All right, ramp it up a level.''
 The new scoring system has left her head full of numbers, Cohen said, as she makes sure that she spins the proper number of revolutions and holds her spiral for the required number of seconds. It's something she does not like, counting instead of simply performing. But she also appears more relaxed, believing that her real accomplishment is simply showing up here.
 ''I've been to two Olympics and I would love to go a third time, but it's not the end all of my life,'' Cohen said.
 Still, many are counting on her to succeed. Women from South Korea and Japan have come to dominate skating, and the United States risks not winning an Olympic medal in women's competition for the first time since 1964, three years after 18 members of the American team died in a plane crash.
 ''The sport is always looking for new stars, and right now they're in short supply,'' said Shep Goldberg, Kwan's agent. ''If Sasha makes the Olympic team, she'll be the biggest American star in the Games, including Lindsey Vonn, given the popularity of figure skating.''
 Stars on Ice, the tour that Cohen headlines, could also use her renewed Olympic credentials to help boost ticket sales in a struggling economy.
 ''She silenced the doubters tonight,'' said Byron Allen, the producer of Stars on Ice. ''I think Sasha is the biggest star at this competition. The higher her profile, the higher the ratings, the better it is for Stars on Ice, the better it is for all of skating.''

HEADLINE: Historical Society to Open a Children's Museum

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE

 BODY:
When thinking of ways to spend a rainy Saturday afternoon, studying history is not high on the list for most families. Now, in a bid to make history more vivid, alluring and accessible for the Wii generation, an interactive ''museum within a museum,'' focusing on the lives of young New Yorkers, will open in November 2011 on the lower level of the New-York Historical Society, museum officials said.
 The DiMenna Children's History Museum, as it will be known, is part of the $60 million renovation of the historical society building on Central Park West, Louise Mirrer, the president and chief economic officer of the museum, said this week. The roughly 4,000-square-foot museum has been designed by Lee H. Skolnick Architecture & Design Partnership with a $5 million donation from Joseph A. and Diana DiMenna. 
 The new museum will focus on the stories of children, from famous figures like Alexander Hamilton, who came to New York as a teenage orphan to attend college, to the boys and girls who hawked newspapers on city streets 100 years ago. 
 ''In schools, history tends to be about figures once they have matured and become important,'' Ms. Mirrer said. ''But if we want history to become alive for children, what better way to teach them than showing them children from other periods? We want to be on the permanent agenda of children and families in New York.''
 Kenneth T. Jackson, a history professor at Columbia University who is also a senior historian at, and a past president of, the historical society, said: ''It's an unusual effort to make a serious attempt to engage young people with the past. Generally, children's museums are not about history, and history museums are not about children.'' 
 The mini-museum's artifacts, some of them never exhibited before, will be drawn from the historical society's vast collections, said Valerie Paley, the society's historian for special projects. Aimed at roughly a fourth-grade level, the information in the exhibits will nevertheless be intended to appeal to all ages, she said, adding that educators helped select a diverse group of historical figures to illuminate different aspects of history.
 A pavilion about newsboys and newsgirls, some as young as 7 when they hawked newspapers for pennies in the early part of the 20th century, will also contain documents showing the extent of the child-labor problem at the time. 
 Information about the ''orphan trains'' that took thousands of destitute children from New York to families in rural and farm communities across the country will be accompanied by a huge archive from the Children's Aid Society: journal entries from social workers, children's artwork, photographs and letters. Children will also be able to sit next to a cutout of a composite orphan on a three-dimensional train, listen to train noises and see a map of places along the routes.
 Most of the exhibits will focus on individuals, like the young Hamilton or Esteban Bellan, who came to New York from Cuba at about 13 and was the first Latin American baseball player in a major league, about 1870. A ''talking'' portrait of a young Cornelia van Varick, daughter of a 17th-century female textile merchant, is meant to show what life was like for a girl of about 10 in 1700.
 There is also the story of Dr. James McCune Smith, a little-known but influential New York native who in the 1830s was the first black university-trained physician in the country. His exhibit will include rare documents showing how he learned math and spelling at the African Free School, an institution for black New Yorkers. 
 Smith, forced by discrimination to receive his medical training in Scotland, established a practice and a pharmacy in lower Manhattan; was an abolitionist who founded an orphanage for black children; and wrote widely about many topics. 
 Though the number of children's museums around the country has grown tremendously in recent decades -- there were 243 of them in 2007, with another 78 in the planning stages, according to one study, compared with 38 in 1975 -- the DiMenna museum will be one of very few history museums for children. Since becoming president in 2004, Ms. Mirrer has sought a new prominence for the historical society, and the children's museum is part of that effort. 
 The ''Slavery in New York'' exhibition, which began in 2005, broke attendance records for the society, which opened in 1804. Total attendance has risen 156 percent since Ms. Mirrer's tenure began, according to society figures, with attendance by school groups up 429 percent. 
 The DiMenna museum will also have interactive features like touch screens, a place where children can videotape their own histories, and a ''historical facebook'' about contemporaries of the historical figures. Visitors will be able to use maps and other documents to solve historical mysteries and to see toys from other periods. Most elements of the exhibitions will be permanent. 
 ''The unifying architectural design is that you'll feel like you're inside a cabinet of curiosities,'' said Lee Skolnick, who has designed about 50 children's museums around the country. ''Names and dates and old etchings are not the way you reach kids. Kids are sophisticated, so we don't do greeting cards. These are intense places with a lot of exciting information.'' 
 Children 12 and under will continue to receive free admission to the society and will have free admission to the new museum.

HEADLINE: Jobless Rates Rose in 42 States in November

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Unemployment rates rose in 43 states last month, the government said Friday, painting a bleak picture of the job market and illustrating nationwide data released two weeks ago.
 The rise in joblessness was a sharp change from November, when 36 states said their unemployment rates fell. Four states -- Delaware, Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina -- reported record-high jobless rates in December. 
 New Jersey's rate, meanwhile, rose to a 33-year high of 10.1 percent while New York's reached a 26-year high of 9 percent.
 Analysts said the report showed the economy is recovering at too weak a pace to generate consistent job creation. A lot of states that had started to add jobs in November gave up the gains in December, Sophia Koropeckyj, managing director at Moody'sEconomy.com, said.
 Texas and Georgia lost more jobs in December than they had gained the previous month, Ms. Koropeckyj noted, while Arizona and South Carolina lost nearly as many as they had gained.
 That is consistent with nationwide trends. Employers shed 85,00 jobs in December, the government said earlier this month, after notching a small gain of 4,000 jobs in November.
 In another nationwide trend, long-suffering states like California and Michigan saw their jobless rates stabilize even as they continued to bleed jobs. That was because thousands of frustrated workers gave up hunting for work and dropped out of the labor force, which means they are not included in the unemployment rate.
 California lost 38,800 jobs, the most of any state. But its unemployment rate was unchanged at 12.4 percent, the fifth-highest in the nation. That was because 107,000 people, or 0.6 percent of the state's work force, stopped job-hunting.
 Michigan shed 15,700 jobs, but 31,000 people left the labor force. That caused the state's jobless rate to fall slightly, to 14.6 percent from 14.7 percent. Michigan has the nation's highest unemployment rate.
 Still, Michigan has actually gained about 10,000 jobs over the past three months, as automakers and other manufacturers have bolstered production to restock inventories depleted over the summer and early fall.
 ''That's a positive thing for a state that has been doing so terribly for so long,'' said Dave Iaia, an economist at IHS Global Insight.
 Texas lost the second-most jobs: 23,900. That sent its jobless rate to 8.3 percent in December from 8 percent. The next-largest job losses were in Ohio, Illinois and Michigan.
 Many states saw sharp drops in restaurant, hotel and other leisure employment, a sign that consumers are still holding back on their spending. Nationwide, the United States lost 25,000 leisure and hospitality jobs in December.

HEADLINE: U.S. Sales Continue to Weigh on McDonald's

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
McDonald's Corporation, the fast-food restaurant chain, reported a higher quarterly profit on Friday as sales in the international markets offset its weak American business, which is grappling with high unemployment and rampant discounting. 
 The company said in its earnings report that sales trends remained positive in January.
 Sales at American stores open at least a year, or same-store sales, rose 1 percent in December, after two months of declines. The company has faced competition from fast-food chains like Burger King and Taco Bell, which are using low prices to lure diners.
 McDonald's said fourth-quarter profit was $1.22 billion, or $1.11 a share, up from $985.3 million, or 87 cents a share, a year earlier.
 Excluding one-time items, McDonald's earned $1.03 a share. On that basis, analysts' average forecast was $1.02, according to Thomson Reuters.
 Revenue, which includes sales from company-owned restaurants plus royalties from franchisees and other fees, rose 7 percent to $5.97 billion, topping analysts' forecast of $5.94 billion.
 Globally, same-store sales rose 2.3 percent for the quarter and 2.7 percent in December.
 McDonald's and some other fast-food restaurants had benefited when the global economic downturn sent customers to lower-priced fare, including McDonald's Dollar Menu items.
 But some consumers recently have returned to more upscale chains like the Panera Bread Company and the Starbucks Corporation -- leading some analysts to say that fast-food chains are in for a period of sinking sales and rampant discounting, two trends that hobbled pricier restaurants for much of the recession.

Peter Facinelli assumes a ghostly pallor as Carlisle, Edward's doctor father and the head of a picture-pretty, well-behaved clan (played by Ashley Greene, Nikki Reed, Jackson Rathbone and Kellan Lutz) that, but for occasional hunting sprees, likes to think of itself as, uh, vegetarian. Manohla Dargis, writing in The New York Times, called the film ''a deeply sincere, outright goofy vampire romance for the hot-not-to-trot abstinence set.''

HEADLINE: Letters: The Consumer vs. the Producer

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 In ''Credit Cards and Reluctant Regulators'' (Fair Game, Jan. 17), Gretchen Morgenson noted how critics of a new consumer protection agency see it as an example of a ''nanny state.'' 
 Regulation of business, however, has long been a function of the state and hardly falls into the category of babying the public. The question has always been this: Whose interest will the state serve -- that of the consumers or that of the producers? 
 Before modern democracy, the state almost invariably served the interests of producers and sellers of services. If it was good for the East India Company, for instance, it was good for the state. Yet even in modern times, this cozy relationship has flourished, despite setbacks like the Great Depression. And since 1980, the conservative movement has rolled back consumer protections while extolling the virtues of an unregulated free market.
 In ''The Wealth of Nations,'' Adam Smith asserted that the purpose of economic activity should be to serve the consumers' interest. This idea, and not some bogus concern about a ''nanny state,'' is what our public servants should be focusing on.

HEADLINE: Ready to Spend, But Not to Boast

BYLINE: By LAURA M. HOLSON

 BODY:
LAST year, investment bankers and their spouses kept their wallets shut during bonus season, first, out of panic, and later, fearing mobs with torches would descend upon their gated estates. 
 Now, after a year of self-imposed austerity and in what is shaping up as a spectacular bonus season, the Wall Street crowd is shaking off what one luxury retailer called its ''frugal fatigue.'' Unlike earlier spending sprees, however, the consumption will be a lot less conspicuous.
 On Wednesday, Morgan Stanley said it was setting aside $14.4 billion for salary and bonuses, or $235,000 per employee. A day later Goldman Sachs said it would pay an average of $498,000, with top producers at each of the two banks earning in the millions. 
 More than in past years, this year's bonus numbers are stirring deep resentment in a nation staggering under 10 percent unemployment. 
 Yet there is another class of individuals, beside the fortunate few receiving Wall Street windfalls, who celebrate bonuses: purveyors of goods and services to the wealthy, from Greenwich, Conn., to Gramercy Park, who stand to see their own fortunes improve. In the New York area's own kind of trickle-down, real estate agents, high-end car dealers and luxury retailers are all welcoming this bonus season as if it were their own. 
 In the Hamptons, where real estate agents court bankers looking for summer homes, the sales are also expected to be a boon for contractors, movers and groundskeepers. ''A community like the Hamptons depends on house trades,'' said Diane Saatchi, an agent with Saunders and Associates who just sold a home to a banker for $4.9 million. 
 ''Don't ask to talk to him about it, because he won't,'' Ms. Saatchi said of the buyer, deflecting a reporter. ''They don't want anyone to know they are buying.'' That includes the banker's extended family, she explained, because he is worried they will ask him for money. 
 No one, she said, ''is bragging about anything.''
 At the heart of Wall Streeters' anticipated splurge is pent-up demand after a year dominated by fears of a new depression, retailers and cultural observers say. ''For whatever reason, people feel the need to reward themselves for doing something good even if that just means surviving,'' said Alexandra Lebenthal, an investment manager and creator of a fictional column about financial high jinks for NewYorkSocialDiary.com.
 At the same time, investment bankers want to avoid the wrath of a fed-up public that continues to blame them for the nation's recessionary ills. On Jan. 13, the chief executives of the nation's four largest banks took a drubbing in hearings from Congressional leaders, who criticized their pay practices as being out of whack with the rest of the country. The Obama administration is channeling that populism with proposals to further regulate and tax banks. 
 As such, the prevailing wisdom on Wall Street is less show and no tell. 
 ''Bankers are being told by their bosses to be careful,'' said Janet Hanson, who was an executive at Goldman Sachs for 14 years and is a founding member of 85 Broads, a professional women's networking organization. ''I mean, how does it look if you got a $1 million bonus from Goldman Sachs and you are sporting around in a new Audi TT? People will hate you.'' (To deflect criticism, Goldman announced last week it would pay its top 30 executives in stock only.) 
 Few Wall Street executives or their spouses contacted for this article were willing to discuss how they planned to spend or invest their bonuses, expressing a fear of public scorn combined with the silence about personal rewards that bankers usually observe. 
 One banker's wife, who did not want to be named, said she and others like her felt more financially secure these days. ''There is the sense in the community that the world is not coming to an end,'' she said. Of bonus critics, she added, executives like her husband work hard and are unjustly singled out as greedy. ''Everybody wants someone to blame,'' she said, ''and rich people are an easy target.''
 She and her husband have earmarked his bonus for two purposes. First, they want to set aside enough money for their four children's college funds. But they are also shopping for a vacation home -- perhaps from a buyer forced to sell. ''It is a good time to buy,'' she said. A friend of theirs, another financial executive, recently bought a house in Vermont weeks before it was to be foreclosed upon. 
 As much as Wall Street executives are seeking value, decisions are also based on whether they (and their new possessions) can hide in plain sight. A case in point: Manhattan Motorcars offered two lease programs in December, each costing about $100,000. The first was a one-year lease for a Rolls-Royce Phantom Drophead Coupe with embroidered headrests and a brushed steel hood. The second was a three-year lease for a Bentley Flying Spur or GT convertible, both of which are more understated than the Rolls.
 Brian Miller, the owner of Manhattan Motorcars, said the Bentleys were more popular with Wall Street executives, not because they were less expensive, but because they attracted less attention. ''They said they wanted to tone down their exposure and get something more staid and sedate,'' Mr. Miller said. ''Later on they said they could come back and get something flashy.''
 New York's wealthiest families have always had money to spend whether they received bonuses this year or not. But it might have been seen as insensitive last year to parade down Madison Avenue, shopping bags in hand, while so many other Americans were losing jobs. Even those who had money didn't spend it, retailers said. But many high-end retailers said they began seeing a shift in November, as news of Wall Street's spectacular profits circulated. 
 Art sales were brisk in the fall, said Barbara Gladstone, who owns a gallery in Chelsea. She anticipates an even better spring as the dark mood that prevailed in Manhattan through much of last year begins to brighten. Simply put, shoppers, like teenage girls at a high school dance, move in packs. Once a few high-end buyers emerge, the rest will follow.
 ''A lot of clients' hesitation was psychological,'' Ms. Gladstone said. ''They were waiting until they felt better. And then they got tired of waiting.''
 Suzanne Johnson, the general manager of Saks Fifth Avenue's flagship store, said many wealthy customers were suffering from what she called ''frugal fatigue.'' After a year of looking, they are ready to treat themselves. Next month, Saks is holding an event at its Kiton men's wear boutique where made-to-order suits can cost as much as $21,000. It will feature Kiton's craftsmen and is timed to bonus season, she said.
 She recalled, too, a couple -- the husband was a banker -- who came in last month and looked at a pair of earrings from the Roberto Coin Cento collection that cost about $5,000. Days later he returned and bought them for his wife. ''They are turning 'looking' into an 'impulse buy,' '' Ms. Johnson said. ''It is about inner self-gratification rather than letting people know how rich you are.''
 At the same time, however, luxury merchants predict it will take at least five years to return to 2007 spending levels. One reason is that some bankers are getting restricted stock that they won't be able to sell for years, instead of cash.
 ''It's not like they are running around screaming now,'' said Frederick Anderson, president of the fashion designer Douglas Hannant's company, which opened a boutique in the Plaza last summer. ''But they are making their appointments and keeping them. Last year, they used to make an appointment and cancel it. It got to be a joke. After the fourth time you're like: 'I get it. You aren't coming in.' ''
 ''A lot of people are scared to go out because they are afraid of being criticized,'' he added. ''How you spend your money now is a social comment. Everyone is looking.''
 In a striking twist on how the have-a-lots see themselves, social distinctions seem to have developed regarding who can flaunt what and where. It is in poor taste, for example, for employees of investment banks that were bailed out using taxpayer dollars to show off much of anything. But that is not the case among hedge fund managers whose companies didn't receive federal assistance.
 Ms. Lebenthal, the investment manager and columnist, recalled being at a party recently and getting on an elevator with a hedge fund manager's wife who was wearing a $10,000 white fur jacket paired with faded jeans. Surprised at the display, Ms. Lebenthal stared.
 ''They feel much less a sense of propriety because they didn't get government money,'' Ms. Lebenthal said of employees at hedge funds. ''They don't feel as if they have to spend less.''
 But spring is not far off -- and that means more opportunities for financiers and their spouses to reward themselves: paintings bought at art auctions, summer homes in Sag Harbor and silken gowns to wear to the season's gala parties. Will Wall Street restrain itself as it seeks to repair its damaged image?
 ''I think it will be interesting to see what big houses go up for sale or who buys the first big necklace,'' Ms. Lebenthal said. ''Even when there is still so much populist anger.''

HEADLINE: New Guidelines Could Make Co-op Renovations Tougher

BYLINE: By TERI KARUSH ROGERS

 BODY:
IF they had a theme song, the new co-op renovation guidelines from the New York City Bar Association might be set to the rock anthem ''We're Not Gonna Take It.''
 Responding to a decade of renovations-gone-wild, the model alteration agreement, as it is known, which will be posted on the association's Web site next month, is in many respects a bill of rights for neighbors, and a headache for renovators.
 ''As the price of real estate shot up this past decade,'' said Eva Talel, the chairwoman of the bar association's co-op and condominium committee and a real estate partner at Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, ''it was more economic price wise and tax wise to buy the two-bedroom next door and combine it with your own apartment. These megarenovations created new challenges that volunteer co-op boards just weren't quite papered up for. We were seeing more litigation and more contentiousness and a general state of unhappiness within buildings.'' 
 In general, such guidelines are meant to be customized by lawyers representing individual co-op boards, so their members -- forewarned about the full range of possible renovation calamities -- make wise decisions about which parts of an owner's proposal they will allow and which they won't. As for the would-be renovators, they must agree to adhere to these dos and don'ts in exchange for board approval.
 Why update the guidelines now? Because a better balance needs to be struck between permitting renovations and minimizing trouble for neighbors, Ms. Talel explained. Also, it has been 10 years since they were last revamped. (Another set of guidelines, by the Real Estate Board of New York, has been widely customized but was last updated in 2003, before the full brunt of the renovation frenzy bore down on co-ops and condos.)
 As boards phase in the new templates, Ms. Talel added, unit owners may find themselves paying more than they are currently accustomed to, starting with several thousand dollars for a reviewing architect or engineer hired by the board to provide ''much closer review of the proposed plans and specifications before they're approved by the building.'' 
 Significantly, in an attempt to thwart the ''bait-and-switch'' renovations that so bedevil co-op boards, these outside consultants will also monitor construction to ensure that what gets built matches what was actually approved. 
 ''As the market was going crazy,'' said Jeffrey S. Reich, a partner in the law firm Wolf Haldenstein Adler Freeman & Herz in Manhattan, ''you had people creating bigger and bigger apartments and more grand types of renovations. You were seeing things that really pushed the envelope.''
 These included complex vertical and horizontal apartment combinations, the enclosure of hallways and other common spaces, and a profusion of wet-over-dry (e.g. one resident's Jacuzzi over another's bedroom) and living-room-over-bedroom configurations that did not aid restful slumber below.
 Indeed, even after the market fizzled, the pace and intensity of renovations did not slow in tandem, according to at least one prominent manager of luxury buildings, Mitchell S. Gelberg.
 ''The volume of the renovations and their extent and complexity have been tremendous in existing and even new buildings as people have decided not to move,'' said Mr. Gelberg, a managing director of residential management at Rose Associates, which specializes in high-end co-op and condominium buildings. 
 Meanwhile, an evolving understanding of the ramifications of secondhand smoke and excessive noise, and of renovations' impact on the building itself -- along with a new noise code and other constantly changing requirements in the city's administrative code -- has kept boards and their lawyers scrambling to update alteration agreements.
 The revised guidelines for renovation projects will also call for increases in minimum insurance coverage and security deposits. Ranges under discussion for deposits alone run from $5,000 to $100,000 or, using another scale, a hefty percentage (say 10 to 20 percent) of the project.
 In addition, renovators will face tougher standards on sound and odor transmission, both during and after construction -- starting with limits on certain noise- and dust-producing tools and the length of time they may be used.
 ''There is a clear statement of responsibility both during and after the renovation to not adversely impact neighbors,'' Ms. Talel said. That covers everything from dust and construction noise produced during a project, to sound and odors (a la secondhand smoke and roasted cauliflower) produced afterward. 
 Leak prevention is another area of reform. Renovations that call for cutting into a building's facade (by installing through-wall air-conditioners, for instance) will engender more scrutiny under the new guidelines. 
 Likewise, Ms. Talel said, rooftop projects including terraces and greenhouses are now known to be a ''huge potential problem'' when it comes to wayward water. 
 ''They may be doable,'' she said, ''but as a board you've really got to make sure appropriate protections are taken.'' 
 The model agreement not only imposes standards for roof projects but also assigns the renovator responsibility for ongoing maintenance and troubleshooting. 
 This responsible-ever-after theme is carried forward into just about every other facet of renovation. Maintenance of any ''altered condition'' would be thrust squarely on the shoulders of the renovator, as well as full responsibility for any legal fees paid by a building in connection with the project.
 Indeed, under the new guidelines there are no free rides.
 ''Heavy-duty alterations can abuse and monopolize service elevators,'' Ms. Talel said, ''so there's another issue about making sure the building is compensated for this.'' She was referring to the monthly so-called facilities fees tacked onto a renovation to cover wear-and-tear and staffing expenses. Though the agreement may not include a specific range, fees already being levied by some buildings range from $500 to $15,000 a month, depending on the size of the renovation and the relative wealth of a building's shareholders.
 Renovators whose projects drag on too long will need to sign new alteration agreements with their boards that would impose daily fees intended to discourage such delays. Ms. Talel predicted that depending on the building, these fees would range from $200 to $2,000 a day.
 As real estate lawyers and managing agents hastened to point out, a portion of these updates have already been written into agreements that have over the years been customized on a per-building (or per-lawyer) basis.
 The new guidelines are meant to be tweaked. ''It's important not to just rely blindly on the form,'' Mr. Reich said. ''You need to tailor it to a building's unique requirements.'' 
 The new guidelines, which apply only to co-ops (a condo version should follow late next year) are meant to set minimum standards.
 Ms. Talel said she expected higher-end buildings to add more bells and whistles. ''They want stricter requirements,'' she said, ''and their shareholders can afford to do more.''

HEADLINE: On Liberia's Shore, Catching a New Wave

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER. 
HELENE COOPER, a White House correspondent for The Times, is the author of ''The House at Sugar Beach: In Search of a Lost African Childhood'' (Simon & Schuster).

 BODY:
WE were less than 30 minutes from our destination of Robertsport, home to Liberia's nascent surfing scene, and gliding along what one local had accurately described as ''the best dirt road in the country,'' when my driver, Andrew, and I got into a loud and boisterous fight. 
 ''Whooo? People live on that mountain?'' Andrew said incredulously, after I'd idly commented that it might be nice to have a vacation house on Grand Cape Mount. He whistled at the Western nonsense I was spouting after living 25 years in the United States. ''No way,'' he said. ''Not in Liberia. You've been in America too long. People will only go to the mountain to make witch or talk to their ancestors.'' To drive home his point, Andrew pulled over to ask a man walking along the road his opinion. 
 Sigh. Next to us stretched Lake Piso, the 40-square-mile, drop-dead beautiful oblong lake that dominates western Liberia, near the Sierra Leone border. Just ahead loomed the lushly green -- and in Andrew's eyes, ominous -- Grand Cape Mount, the last natural landmark between us and the big waves at Robertsport. The waves that I would be examining to see whether Liberia, my birth country, could transform itself from poster child for West Africa's wretched civil wars to travel posters for West Africa's best surfing. 
 It was, I'll grant you, a far-fetched thought. This is a country that introduced itself to my generation during the 1980s and '90s with horrific images of child soldiers and rebel soldiers dressed in wedding gowns and blond wigs. But that was before the strongman Charles Taylor was hustled out of town in 2003, before Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf became the first woman ever elected president of a country on this still patriarchal continent. 
 Liberia has been war-free for six years now. A fledgling tourism industry is taking shape. There are a handful of nice hotels -- and even a couple of luxe ones -- in the capital of Monrovia now, with more under construction. There are tour companies offering trips to see chimpanzees and hippos in wildlife sanctuaries up country. And there are a few hearty souls finally trying to take advantage of the country's 350 miles of lush, white shoreline.
 I wasn't coming to surf myself. I barely swam until I was out of high school and living in the United States, and though the thought of surfing always seemed exhilarating, Robertsport was out of my league.
 When we finally arrived at Nana's Lodge there -- think safari camp on the beach -- the rain was pouring down so hard that I, surfing novice that I am, was sure all the surfers would be taking shelter and drinking Club Beer at the beachside bar and restaurant that serves as the only real gathering spot. To be sure, there were the usual scraggly California, Hawaii and South Africa types digging into a buffet lunch of chicken stew with rice, cabbage, potato salad and the hot pepper sauce that Liberians use as a seasoning for everything. West African highlife music, steel drums and all, filtered from speakers.
 I could be in Jamaica, I thought. But then I looked at the sea.
 Jamaica didn't have waves like this. 
 About a hundred feet away, the Atlantic was hurling itself at the shoreline in surging swells that crested in arc after arc. A trio of surfers -- two Liberian, one Western -- were riding a wave that started to break at a point called Shipwreck, before cresting directly across from the historic cottonwood tree where freed American blacks, including my great-great-great-great-grandfather, had carved their names in 1829 after their ship, the Harriet, arrived on the Liberian shore from Norfolk, Va.
 My mouth dropped open. I'd known that I would find white surfers at Robertsport, and I'd heard that a few Liberians had taken up the sport, too. 
 But I hadn't really believed it. It's just not something that Liberians do. In the same way that, for all my Americanized pretensions, I knew that Andrew was right -- Liberians wouldn't really live on a mountain -- I knew we didn't go into the ocean much either. I grew up in a house 200 yards from the Atlantic just outside Monrovia, and we never went into the sea; we left that to the tourists. We were willing to venture into the many lagoons that collected near the country's beaches, but there was no way we were going to brave the Atlantic, with its rough waves and fierce undertow. Not to mention the underwater neegees -- or spirits -- waiting to take you off to be eaten by sharks.
 Apparently, two civil wars and the march of time had changed all that. ''When I first saw this guy surfing, it was like magic to me,'' said Benjamin McCrumada, 21, a Liberian fisherman turned surfer. The rain had finally stopped, and he was drying off at a beachside table, reminiscing about the day that changed his life. It was 2005, and the country was slowly getting back on its feet, postwar. The only tourists in Liberia at the time were relief workers taking weekend breaks. One of them, Magnus Wolfe Murray, a Scottish ecologist and aid worker, had come to surf at Robertsport, where the angle of the coastline created ocean swells from the south that came in a wrapping form, making the waves, up to 20 feet high, peel along the coast rather than just dumping straight on. 
 The result: long, gorgeous waves that you can ride for 200 yards or more. ''To just see someone riding like that on top of the water, with his hands up,'' he said, his wonder still palpable four years after the fact. 
 If there is one thing Liberians are not shy about, it is approaching strangers. Benjamin went up to Magnus and asked to try his board. With his new friend tutoring him, he tried three times, falling into the surf each time. 
 But on the fourth try, as a gentle wave was breaking at Loco Point, Benjamin managed to stand on the board, for 10 seconds. And that was all it took. For those 10 seconds, he said, he forgot he was living in a postwar zone. He was gliding on top of the Atlantic, wave crashing, heart bursting with the freedom of it. ''I felt like I was on a motorcycle,'' he said, smiling. ''I was so happy. I didn't know you could do this.''
 Now Benjamin, along with a growing -- but still small -- number of Liberian surfers, and a much-faster-growing number of world-class surfers always on the lookout for the next big wave, are slowly carving out this country's embryonic surfing scene. Right now, that scene is strictly Robinson Crusoe: surfers camp in tents underneath the now enormous cottonwood tree and cook meals over an open fire, or stay in the raised wood-floored structures -- there are 11 in all -- at Nana's Lodge, eating in the seaside restaurant and listening to highlife music late into the night. One of the lodge's owners, Joseph Richards, a South African mining executive, conducts charter fishing trips in search of barracuda, mackerel and marlin (to eat) and humpback whales (to watch). 
 And always, there are the waves to ride. It's the kind of tropical, laid-back vacation -- with a tinge of magic and the occult provided by Grand Cape Mount -- that leaves many of the Western surfers who come here looking for property to rent. 
 ''The whole experience in Robertsport felt like living inside a classic book about an African adventure,'' said an e-mail message from Shayne McIntyre, who spent 17 days taping an ''On Surfari'' episode for National Geographic television in September and never had a flat-wave day. ''We were staying on the water in wood-decked safari tents, watching fishermen dodge absolutely perfect waves while pulling in their catch from hand-carved dugout canoes, while ladies with their children wrapped to their backs in beautiful print clothes crossed the sand. And behind us an immensely thick, impenetrable jungle rich with the sounds of singing birds and dew dripping on the leaves.''
 Or, if you listen to Andrew, medicine men up to God-knows-what. But hey, clearly times are changing. If Liberians are now surfing, who knows? Maybe we'll soon be building mountaintop chalets on Grand Cape Mount. Already, Nana's Lodge is organizing hikes into the rain forest for tourists, with Liberian guides escorting. Just don't expect any of them to camp overnight with you in the bush.
 SURFING, ROBINSON CRUSOE STYLE
 GETTING THERE
 Probably the best way to fly to Liberia from New York is via Brussels. Brussels Airlines (www.brusselsairlines.com) has flights to Roberts International Airport in Monrovia, the capital. A Web search for a flight in February found a round-trip economy ticket from Kennedy Airport starting around $1,900. 
 MONROVIA
 Lodging and restaurants commonly give prices in U.S. dollars. 
 There are several new -- as in postwar -- hotels in Monrovia. The most luxe and expensive one is RLJ Kendeja Hotel (231-22-100-100; www.rljkendejaresort.com) just outside the capital. It has ocean-view double rooms and suites that start at $200, including breakfast.. 
 In Mamba Point, near downtown Monrovia, at the Cape Hotel (231-77-006-633; thecapehotel.com.lr), double rooms start at $200 a night.
 Monrovia has a number of restaurants that serve both Liberian food -- spicy -- and Western fare. N'yla Cafe (231-5-516-500; www.ro-zi.com), on Bestman Road in the Airfield section in Sinkor, has Liberian fusion food like goat soup and grilled pepper pork; entrees start around $10. 
 Evelyn's Restaurant, Bar and Grill on Broad Street (231-77-053-104) has daily Liberian specials like fried potato greens and palm butter starting at $8, along with a full complement of Western dishes, including burgers.
 IN ROBERTSPORT
 There are plenty of big waves at the beaches just outside Monrovia, but the best surfing is in Robertsport, a three-hour drive, and getting there means hiring a car and driver. (You can rent a car without the driver, but the price isn't that much different.) The above hotels in Monrovia can arrange car rentals for around $100 a day, but if you ask around, you can find much cheaper rates from budding entrepreneurs. 
 In Robertsport, raised tents at Nana's Lodge (231-6-668-332) with two double beds are $100 a night. 
 Robertsport Community Works (231-77-339-647; campsite@robertsportcommunityworks.org) also offers tents, next to Nana's Lodge, for $10 to $15 a night. Nana's Lodge offers breakfast, lunch and dinner for residents and nonresidents alike, and Robertsport Community Works will also arrange to cook for campers on request.
 Information on lodging in Robertsport and other helpful information for surfers can be found at www.surfliberia.com/home.html.

HEADLINE: For Richer or for ... Not Quite as Rich

BYLINE: By DAVID SEGAL; Alain Delaqueriere contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
EVERY era needs an emblematic tycoon, and for the age of the Great Recession, you couldn't do better than Peter M. Brant.
 Never a figure of national renown, Mr. Brant has for years loomed large in that slender niche of American culture where vast wealth meets good taste and winter tans. In Savile Row suits and with plenty of alpha-male style, he spent the last decade quietly expanding his newsprint manufacturing empire, borrowing hundreds of millions of dollars and gobbling up mills until his company, White Birch, was the second-largest player in North America.
 By 2008, he seemed, like our economy, to be a spectacularly efficient money-making machine -- a billionaire with a vast art collection and his very own polo team. His personal life appeared just as charmed. In 1995, the former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour became his second wife, and the couple and their four children shuttled to homes in Greenwich, Conn., Sagaponack, N.Y., and Palm Beach, Fla. It all looked pretty glamorous.
 It looks different today. 
 There is no telling which is now costing Mr. Brant more -- his business or his marriage. But that is only because his business is privately held, whereas his marriage is exploding in a way that could hardly be more public. ''Seymour-Brant Divorce Mayhem,'' read a headline in June in The New York Post.
 So what we have here is a portrait of love and leverage gone wrong, a reversal of fortune that -- like so many stories of our economic cratering -- would have been hard to imagine a little more than a year ago.
 In May, Brant v. Brant began to feed the tabloids one plate of hors d'oeuvres after another, piled high with gossipy morsels of news. There were accusations of theft (he accused her of misappropriating $700,000 worth of clothing, furniture, draperies and sconces; she said he sold a fortune's worth of her jewelry), a fight over urine tests (he's made frequent references to her history of drug addiction and two stints in rehab) and a custody battle so brutal that a judge prohibited both parents from standing in the same room when one of their children calls the other. 
 Mrs. Brant and her lawyers did not respond to interview requests.
 Beyond the cage-match particulars, court filings in the contest have begun to crowbar some light onto the finances of a closely held, one-man conglomerate. Few careers have caromed between such highs and lows -- Mr. Brant served time in prison for tax problems in 1990 -- and few portfolios are so colorful and varied. Mr. Brant owns an immense trove of contemporary art, including scores of pieces by Andy Warhol, whom he befriended in the 1970s, as well as work by Jeff Koons and Jean-Michel Basquiat. 
 Mr. Brant also publishes three magazines: Art in America, The Magazine Antiques, and Interview, the last of which Mr. Warhol created. There are real estate developments, a share of a private jet and a working farm that his financial affidavit says once cost $500,000 a month to run.
 For years, the financial foundation of all these ventures has been the newsprint company, which Mr. Brant's father co-founded in the 1940s. But these are dismal days for anyone selling paper to the print media. Several White Birch rivals have filed for bankruptcy, and White Birch missed an $18 million interest payment due in late September.
 Mr. Brant's creditors -- a group of hedge funds -- might be running out of patience. Last year, they hired a law firm, Latham & Watkins, and an investment bank, Rothschild, both of which have expertise in bankruptcy. This and other tea leaves have a number of analysts and trade reporters contending that White Birch may be on the verge of a major restructuring or worse.
 ''Information leaks out here and there, but the company is not very transparent,'' says Jim Rowland, an analyst who tracks the newsprint business. ''But we're talking about a private company in an industry staring at an abyss of plummeting demand.''
 PETER BRANT isn't talking about defeat.
 He is sitting in the library on the fifth floor of a Manhattan office building he owns at 575 Broadway in SoHo. Its ground floor is occupied by a Prada store. Dressed in a charcoal pinstripe suit with a purple knit tie and a white hankie in the breast pocket, Mr. Brant, 62, radiates baronial wealth and walks with the slightly bowlegged gait of a man who has spent years on a horse. His gravitas is leavened by a warm smile and a bulbous nose that seems borrowed from a vaudeville comedian.
 He has agreed to discuss his life and career, with one very reasonable caveat: his divorce is off-limits. The proceedings reached such a level of vitriol that in June both sides, weary of the gruesome headlines, signed a detente in which they agreed to stop discussing the subject with the news media. Everything else, though, is on the table -- his love of competition included.
 ''My whole life I've hated to lose, no doubt about it,'' he says at one point. ''I've been guilty of that since I was 6 years old, at camp. I have always played to win. That's who I am. But I never hurt anybody. The problem is when you're perceived as being too aggressive where you hurt somebody or do something improper.''
 Naturally, there is no hint in this two-hour interview of his competitiveness or his legendarily hot temper, which, in 1986, led him to challenge an umpire in a polo match to a fistfight. (Mr. Brant says the ump threw a whistle at his head.) Nor is there any sign of his sometimes pitiless approach to deal making. One person in the art market who has negotiated with Mr. Brant described him as a rather exasperating customer.
 ''Even if you've done a bad deal with him before, the stuff he's got is usually so good that you have to listen to him,'' this person said, requesting anonymity because nobody wants to poison a relationship with a major buyer and seller. ''You figure it out. And you hope you have your fingers left when you're done.''
 Friends describe Mr. Brant as charming, loyal and, his public reputation notwithstanding, a sensitive guy who is first and foremost a family man. He is a father of nine children, five from his first marriage (to Sandy Simms Brant) and three with Stephanie Seymour Brant, as well as a stepson from Stephanie's first marriage. Four of his children work for him: his son Chris is president of White Birch; Ryan is director of Brant Publications, where Kelly is the online director; and Alison is the director of the Brant Foundation, which oversees part of his art collection.
 ''We think things are getting better,'' he says, ignoring a cellphone ringing in his pocket as he discusses White Birch's future. ''This isn't a situation where there's a company that's badly managed. This is a situation where the price of newsprint went from 700 and some odd dollars a ton to $420 a ton pretty quickly.''
 He deflects any talk of an imminent bankruptcy and seems unbowed and upbeat for a man who says he personally has lost $1 billion in the span of two years. In a recent court filing, he said the ailing newsprint market and the recession had slashed his net worth to less than $500 million today from $1.4 billion in 2007.
 That's still enough to underwrite not just his own extravagant lifestyle, but his soon-to-be former wife's, too. The court ordered him to pay her $270,000 a month in temporary alimony and child support -- or about $9,000 a day. Mr. Brant has appealed that decision but he may have only himself to blame. Breaking the cardinal second-marriage rule in the multimillionaire's handbook, he wed without a prenuptial agreement.
 ''He was basically head over heels in love with her,'' said a person close to Mr. Brant, who requested anonymity because he didn't want to be publicly linked to the divorce case. ''He's more of a romantic than one would give him credit for at first glance, and it was very much a function of that. There was no discussion of a prenup. He thought this would last forever.''
 It might be the most costly error of Mr. Brant's life. And it has at least one close friend scratching his head in consternation.
 ''It's called sign on the dotted line,'' says Donald Trump, a classmate and childhood buddy of Peter Brant, having grown up with him in the Jamaica Estates section of Queens. ''Being the king of prenups, I'm pretty good at that stuff. You have to have it. You're dealing with huge finances and you need some certainty in your life and a prenup will hold up 100 percent if it's properly drawn.''
 All of which leaves Mr. Trump a tad puzzled about his old pal. ''I'm surprised at Peter. But women can do things to men that are very unusual.'' 
 MR. BRANT was drawn to money and art early on. He attended the University of Colorado, but school was no match for his love for the stock market, and he sometimes skipped class to trade at a nearby brokerage house. His family had given him about $8,000, which he says he parlayed into several hundred thousand dollars as an undergraduate. (''Convertible bonds of Occidental Petroleum,'' he says when asked for one of his greatest hits.)
 He used the money to buy his first pieces of art, which included a couple of Warhols and, later, what he called ''a major Franz Kline.''
 He left college without a diploma during his senior year and went to work at Brant-Allen Industries, a paper conversion company co-founded by his father, Murray Brant, an immigrant from a small town near the border of Romania and Bulgaria. Murray Brant spoke 13 languages and prompted his son's interest in art, film and the newsprint business.
 In the early '70s, Mr. Brant and a cousin, Joseph Allen -- the son of Murray Brant's business partner -- led the company into the manufacturing side of the business, acquiring a stake in a mill in Riviere-du-Loup, Quebec. Later, the company became partners with The Washington Post and Dow Jones, publisher of The Wall Street Journal, in a mill in Ashland, Va.
 Flush with cash, Mr. Brant began collecting art in earnest, eventually buying so many Warhols that the artist asked to meet him. The two would have a somewhat complicated relationship. Mr. Brant was awed by Mr. Warhol and says he felt an instinctive urge to protect him. Mr. Warhol was impressed with Mr. Brant's business acumen -- he was the rare corporate success story in Mr. Warhol's circle -- but found him a little overzealous.
 ''It got to the point where Andy was a little worried that Peter owned too much of his work,'' says Bob Colacello, a former editor of Interview. ''He would say, 'Peter wants everything.' Andy was a control freak, and Peter can be quite controlling, too.''
 Mr. Brant stuck with Mr. Warhol, collecting his work through the '70s and '80s, when the artist was unfashionable and best known for commissioned portraits of well-heeled patrons and a cameo on ''The Love Boat.'' 
 Mr. Brant's dedication paid off. Prices for Mr. Warhol's work have soared since his death in 1987. Mr. Brant says that over the last year, his art collection has been more lucrative than his newsprint business.
 Mr. Brant's business trajectory hit some snags along the way -- most traumatically, a misdemeanor conviction in 1990 for failure to keep adequate tax records. He had billed more than $1.5 million in personal expenses -- including silk sheets, scalp treatments and massages -- to two of his companies. Ultimately, he spent more than 80 days in a federal penitentiary in western Pennsylvania.
 He says the experience was wrenching, humbling and ultimately positive, though he's a little vague on the upsides. He also says that he was probably punished to set a high-profile example -- serving time for a misdemeanor is unusual, he notes -- but adds that he doesn't mean he thinks his sentence was unfair. What irks him most, he says, is the ''scarlet letter'' that the sentence seems to have left on his reputation.
 ''There are people who say, 'Oh, he's a crook.' But I'm not a crook,'' he says. ''And I've basically proven that in my life going forward.''
 Yet Mr. Brant ran afoul of the tax gods again several years ago. In 2003, the Internal Revenue Service sued him and others in a case involving what prosecutors called $26.5 million in unpaid capital gains taxes and interest on the sale of 58 artworks acquired through a shell company in the early '90s.
 In 2004, Mr. Brant contributed to a $9.1 million settlement in the case. Paul Berg, a lawyer for Mr. Brant, said that there was no finding that his client was liable for the taxes, but ''to avoid the uncertainties and costs of litigation, Mr. Brant reached a compromise with the government and the case against him was dismissed with prejudice.''
 ECONOMIC crises have a way of making bold decisions seem, in hindsight, like folly, and the last six years of Mr. Brant's career in the newsprint business are a case in point. With Wall Street asserting a need for consolidation in Mr. Brant's industry, the pace of his mill acquisitions picked up sharply in 2004.
 That year, his company spent $205 million for a second manufacturer in Quebec (this one formerly owned by Enron). Two years later, it spent $135 million for yet another manufacturer in the same province.
 By 2008, he had bought out his partner, Mr. Allen, changed the name of the company to White Birch and put another pile of chips on the table with his largest purchase to date: $305 million for SP Newsprint, a company with operations in Oregon and Georgia.
 When this four-year buying spree was over, Mr. Brant controlled roughly 22 percent of North America's newsprint market, second only to AbitibiBowater, which has 43 percent, according to John Maine, an economist at RISI, which provides information services to the forest products industry. 
 Unfortunately for Mr. Brant, he bought SP Newsprint just as a downturn in the advertising market was starting to crush print media, already battered by competition from the Internet. Magazines and newspapers shrank page sizes, reduced run rates, eliminated sections and, in more than a few cases, ceased publishing. 
 Newsprint use dropped 14 percent in 2008 and an additional 24 percent in 2009, according to Mr. Maine. With capacity outstripping demand, prices fell and mills were closed temporarily to reduce capacity. In some cases, the mills kept running but operated at a loss.
 Early last year, AbitibiBowater filed for bankruptcy. In late December, a smaller company, Blue Heron, followed suit. White Birch's own prospects are difficult to divine; as a private company, the particulars are known only to the principals and a handful of debt holders.
 There are, however, occasional peeks behind the curtain. In November, Debtwire, a news service, reported that the company had renegotiated terms for that missed $18 million interest payment and was working out a restructuring agreement with holders of its $653 million credit facility.
 ''It could be that White Birch and the creditors have a prearranged plan,'' says Andrew Ragsly, who covers White Birch for Debtwire. ''The company could do something out of court where they say, 'Lenders, you guys can take all the equity and own the company.' That happens sometimes and a company avoids bankruptcy proceedings, but the result is the same.''
 All murmurs to the contrary, Mr. Brant says that he likes his odds and that his relationship with his creditors is very good. ''They understand the situation,'' he says. ''We think things are getting better -- we're seeing advertising come back; prices are going up again.''
 For obvious reasons, Mr. Brant would like to persuade his business creditors that he's in robust shape. On other the hand, in a contentious divorce, the goal is typically to poor-mouth your personal balance sheet as much as possible.
 Mr. Brant has been highlighting his financial woes in divorce filings in a state court in Middletown, Conn., but among those who believe he might be overstating his travails is Elaine Gordon, a judge handling his case. In an October ruling, she seemed to cast some doubt on Mr. Brant's financial affidavit, noting that the only material way that he has scaled back his lifestyle is the dismantling of his polo team and the curtailing of some travel. 
 After reviewing the numbers, she decided that Mr. Brant's monthly income was closer to $1.5 million than the $679,000 he claimed.
 STILL, an exact accounting of Mr. Brant's wealth is hard to come by and seems to confound even the mogul himself. A lawyer for Mrs. Brant, Tom Colin, discovered that in a deposition last year.
 Mr. Colin: ''What was your income in 2008, using the same definition of 'income' that you utilized on the financial affidavit that your lawyer says I cannot have?''
 Gaetano Ferro (lawyer for Mr. Brant): ''Objection as to form. But you can answer that.''
 Mr. Brant: ''I don't know.''
 Mr. Colin: ''More or less than 10 million?''
 Mr. Brant: ''I don't know. It's a complicated -- it's very complicated. There are a number of factors that go in, a number of expenses, a number of entities. I cannot answer the question without the documentation.''
 Mr. Colin ultimately tried a variation of the old ''Price Is Right'' technique, citing figures and asking Mr. Brant if his income was higher or lower. Ultimately, the best he could do was to determine that the number was greater than $20,000 and lower than $25 million.
 What's clear is that Mr. Brant's budget is very lush. He spends $30,000 a month on household supplies, which, he told the court, could be anything from ''toothpaste to towels.'' There's an additional $12,500 a month for miscellaneous personal expenses, and $15,199 a month for personal entertainment expenses.
 An additional $216,000 a month is spent on the Brant Foundation, which maintains a museum for his collection; it opened last year across the street from his 200-acre estate in Greenwich. (During the interview, he jokingly calls the museum the only thing he's ever done that won positive reviews.) 
 Among the museum's treasures is a Maurizio Cattelan sculpture cast in wax of a lifelike, and nude, Stephanie Seymour Brant; the sculpture hangs on a wall. Commissioned by Mr. Brant in 2003, well before the hostilities began, it was inspired, Mr. Cattelan has said, by the animal heads that Mr. Brant has mounted on his living room wall as safari souvenirs. The piece is informally known as ''Trophy Wife'' and Mr. Brant says he has no plans to part with it.
 ''It's a work of art,'' he says.
 Of course, the divorce proceedings suggest that this is one of the rare instances when the trophy has outfoxed the hunter. Not that Mrs. Brant is going to leave her future ex-husband destitute, or even force him into a different tax bracket. Nor is it likely that Mr. Brant's life will be substantially different if, in fact, creditors bounce him from White Birch and his perch atop the newsprint business.
 And this, finally, is what makes Peter Brant the prototypical multimillionaire for our not-so-splendid age: He has made what in hindsight look like disastrous financial decisions, but the guy will live in splendor, come what may.

HEADLINE: Tax Increase For the Rich Is at Issue In Oregon

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

DATELINE: CENTRAL POINT, Ore. 

 BODY:
Few places have felt the twin challenges presented by Oregon's broken state budget and its knotted tax system the way this old farm town has. 
 Facing $3 million in state cuts and no way to raise money, the school district here cut back to a four-day week last fall. Teachers cram in curriculum. Parents juggle child care. Students sleep in on Mondays.
 ''The three-day weekends are nice,'' said Joe DeFranco, who teaches at Mae Richardson Elementary School here, ''but academically, we're strapped.''
 Still more cuts will come unless revenues rise. On Tuesday, voters here and across Oregon will have the chance to make that happen when they decide the fate of two ballot measures that would raise taxes on higher-income residents and on businesses to help pay for public education and other services. Known as Measures 66 and 67, the votes are referendums on $727 million in tax and fee increases that were approved last year by the Democratic-controlled Legislature. 
 Yet if the measures pass, it will probably not be because of support here in largely conservative southwest Oregon. Too many times the state has proposed too many taxes, many residents here say, and this is no exception, never mind the school troubles. 
 Instead, experts say, if the measures pass it will be because Oregon lawmakers found a way to narrowly focus a tax increase that more liberal parts of the state could tolerate, even at a time when a tax increase could not be harder to digest. 
 What happens here may be closely watched elsewhere. While tax increases are probably coming in plenty of other states, most by executive or legislative action, Oregon will be the first this year to ask voters to raise taxes on themselves -- or at least on some of themselves. 
 ''What's the saying? 'Don't tax me. Don't tax thee. Tax the man behind the tree?' '' said Tim Hibbitts, a longtime independent pollster in Oregon. ''The measures were designed and have been sold with the idea that somebody else is going to pay, people who are high-income earners and businesses.''
 Mr. Hibbitts added, ''They were crafted pretty cleverly politically.''
 Supporters, led by teachers and public employees' unions, point out that the income tax increase affects less than 3 percent of the population: individuals who earn more than $125,000 a year. They say the state's wealthier residents should pay more to help those with less. They also say that state businesses enjoy a relatively low tax burden and that most small businesses will pay only $140 more in fees.
 Opponents say the proposals are the wrong fix at the wrong time. State income taxes for wealthier Oregon residents are already among the highest of any state. But the most notable opposition may have come from powerful business groups and prominent executives like Phil Knight of Nike, which is based near Portland. 
 Oregon unemployment is at 11 percent and new taxes will make it even harder to hire, opponents say. They say that supporters are underestimating how many people would be affected, and that while some of the increases are scheduled to fade out, some are not. 
 Complicating matters further, the Legislature has essentially already spent the $727 million in projected revenue by incorporating the anticipated tax increases into the current budget. If the measures fail, lawmakers will have to make new cuts or find another way to raise revenue.
 What many people on each side agree on is that, recession or not, Oregon's tax system is flawed and that passing Measures 66 and 67 is not a long-term solution.
 Oregon is one of only five states with no state sales tax, and voters have repeatedly rejected ballot initiatives to create one. In addition, a statewide cap on property taxes limits how much local governments can raise rates each year. 
 Here in heavily forested Jackson County and in several others, there is another wrinkle. Property taxes were historically low here in part because the counties received payments from the federal government for timber production on federal lands. Yet timber production has declined substantially, and subsequent federal subsidies have not compensated for the decline. That aid, too, is set to phase out.
 John W. Tapogna, a former economist with the Congressional Budget Office who now leads an economics consulting firm in the Pacific Northwest, said the situation facing counties in this part of Oregon could soon become a crisis that might help force the state to look more broadly at its tax structure.
 If that happens, Mr. Tapogna is among many people who believe that the first order of business should be to do away with Oregon's so-called kicker law, a unique instrument among states and one that underscores Oregon's distaste for taxes.
 When times are good, the state sends kicker refunds to residents from revenue that exceeds forecasts by state economists. In December 2007, just as the country was entering the recession, Oregon returned $1.1 billion to residents, bounty from the previous boom year, because of the kicker law. By the spring of 2009, as Oregon's unemployment rate was on its way to becoming one of the highest in the nation, the Legislature was voting to raise taxes by $727 million, the increase now before voters.
 ''On the one hand, we are handing big checks back, and then we're saying we don't have enough to pay for services,'' Mr. Tapogna said. ''It's an absurd process.'' In 2007, the checks averaged about $600 per taxpayer, substantially more than previous kickers had averaged.
 He added, ''The point is, regardless of what happens on Jan. 26, the system is broken, and there's an awful lot of work left to do.''
 Charles Sheketoff, executive director of the Oregon Center for Public Policy, which advocates for lower-income people and helped shape the tax proposals, said he also wanted to do away with the kicker and build a rainy day fund. But he said the state also needed to close more of what he called corporate tax loopholes. 
 Asked about the wisdom of raising taxes in a recession, Mr. Sheketoff pointed to a widely circulated paper co-written several years ago by Peter R. Orszag, now the White House budget director, that said focused tax increases on higher-income earners do less overall economic damage than steep spending cuts.
 While the measures on the ballot Tuesday are not long-term solutions, Mr. Sheketoff said, they are a ''first, important and necessary step.'' 
 ''It only asks a little bit more from the fortunate few who did well during the last upturn and are still doing well today,'' he said. ''If you're going to raise taxes, do what's fair and equitable and right.''

PERSON: Bob Noorda 

HEADLINE: Bob Noorda, 82; Designer Took Modernism Underground

BYLINE: By STEVEN HELLER

 BODY:
Bob Noorda, an internationally known graphic designer who helped introduce a Modernist look to advertising posters, corporate logos and, in the 1960s, the entire New York City subway system, died on Jan. 11 in Milan, his adopted city. He was 82.
 The cause was complications of head trauma suffered in a fall, said Duska Karanov, a designer in the Noorda Design studio in Milan. 
 ''Don't bore the public with mysterious designs,'' Mr. Noorda once said, and he put that dictum into practice. He was a master of spare, elegant and logical designs that caught the eye, from minimalist corporate logos for the Italian publishing house Feltrinelli and the ENI Group of Milan to impressionistic posters for Pirelli, the Italian tire maker. 
 Mr. Noorda's best-known work in the United States was for the Metropolitan Transit Authority, which in 1966 commissioned his firm, Unimark International, to modernize and unify the look of the subway system's signs. The firm had been recommended by Mildred Constantine, an influential design curator at the Museum of Modern Art.
 At the time, Mr. Noorda was based in Milan overseeing the firm's European projects. But the M.T.A. commission lured him to New York, where his design partner Massimo Vignelli had opened a Unimark office. 
 ''I remember when Bob came to New York and spent every day underground in the subway to record the traffic flow in order to determine the points of decision where the signs should be placed,'' Mr. Vignelli said in an interview. 
 The existing signs they encountered were cluttered with various typefaces of different sizes. 
 ''Their system was a mess,'' Mr. Noorda was quoted as saying in ''Unimark International: The Design of Business and the Business of Design'' (Lars Muller), a recently published book by Jan Conradi. ''Sometimes pieces of paper taped to the wall were the only indication for the station.''
 He and Mr. Vignelli set about standardizing the type family to make sure that the signs were cleaner and clearer; they settled on Helvetica, originally a Swiss design known for its sans serif economy and sterility, against a white background. Mr. Noorda worked on every detail, from typeface selection to color coding. 
 He ''had a very systematic mind,'' Mr. Vignelli said, adding that ''his work was extremely civilized.'' 
 Yet the project proved disappointing to the designers. The M.T.A. was responsible for executing the designs and producing the signs in its own sign shop, and Mr. Noorda's directives were not always followed. The sign makers, for example, at first chose to use Standard Medium, a typeface from their own shop. ''They did not want to invest in Helvetica,'' Ms. Conradi wrote.
 Mr. Noorda's black-on-white signs also got dirty quickly, so the M.T.A. switched to white on black. 
 Still, though they have been modified over the years, the signs New York subway riders see today are essentially the work of Mr. Noorda and Mr. Vignelli, from the bold, clean type to the color coding used to identify the system's many train lines.
 Mr. Noorda had helped found Unimark in 1965, teaming up with a group of American and European designers, including Mr. Vignelli, who initially set up shop in Chicago and Milan. 
 Theirs was among the first international design firms to base their work on the Modernist principle that a good design could have a positive effect on all aspects of life, not just on business. An early proponent of unified branding -- the consistent use of distinctive type and imagery to identify a company -- Unimark has been credited with awakening the corporate world to Modernist design thinking. 
 Unimark became identified with the austere Helvetica typeface. ''For better or worse,'' Ms. Conradi wrote, the firm became ''a prime contributor to Helvetica's ubiquitous appearance in corporate identities around the world.''
 Born in Amsterdam in 1927, Mr. Noorda served in the Dutch army in its former East Indies colonies before leaving Holland in 1954 for Milan, where he began his career. He never returned to live in Holland.
 His colorful posters for Pirelli tires, where he was briefly the art director, wed the simplicity of Bauhaus typography to vibrant graphic styling. Yet it was his economical signage system for the Milan subway that opened doors to the corporate world. (Mr. Noorda also worked on the underground transit systems in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and Naples, Italy.) 
 It was in Milan where Mr. Noorda met Mr. Vignelli and established a long business partnership and friendship. They went on to teach together at the School of Industrial Design in Venice before starting Unimark, which eventually opened offices in Switzerland, Germany and Holland as well as in Italy and the United States. It closed in the 1970s.
 Afterward Mr. Noorda opened his own design studio in Milan with his wife, Ornella Vitali Noorda. She survives him, as does their daughter, Catharin, of Milan.
 For his contributions to Milan, Mr. Noorda was given a sepulcher in the city's historic cemetery, the Famedio del Cimitero Monumentale, where some of its most famous citizens are buried.

HEADLINE: It's Not Supposed to Work Like This

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP. 
E-mail: generationb@nytimes.com

 BODY:
LIKE a lot of boomers, Allan Goldstein, 60, has mixed feelings about the online world he inhabits. As a college teacher -- he's the assistant director of the writing program at the Polytechnic Institute of New York University -- he works with young people and feels pressure to keep current. He uses an electronic blackboard system to post his syllabus, class assignments and grades online, but he doesn't trust it. ''There are glitches,'' he said. ''The school's system has crashed a few times. They want us to use it, but I back everything up on paper.''
 While Mr. Goldstein will go online to check the balance and activity for his bills, he will not link to a credit card for automatic payment. ''I'm suspicious -- a lot of friends my age are,'' he said. ''I just don't want to open up bank accounts to these guys.'' 
 Partly, his caution stems from being a victim of credit card fraud several years ago. He lives in Manhattan and believes strangers sifted through his building's trash and found receipts. He discovered they had changed the mailing address on his credit card account. At one point, he received a call from an auto dealership in the South checking whether he was seeking credit approval to buy a car. He wasn't, but he did buy a shredder. ''I'm on my third one,'' he said. ''It does credit cards, staples and eight sheets of paper at a time.''
 Last summer, when T-Mobile announced it would charge customers who continued to pay bills via paper a $1.50 monthly penalty -- an effort to stampede fogies like Mr. Goldstein into modern, greener pastures -- he was successfully stampeded and opened his first account to pay online. And even though so many fogies complained that T-Mobile subsequently reversed its policy, Mr. Goldstein stayed online. ''I figured here's a baby boomer finally getting comfortable with paperless bills,'' he said.
 When his bank, HSBC, offered a higher interest rate for online savings, he seized the moment.
 In mid-December, to increase his frequent-flier miles, he opened a new online American Express business credit card account.
 Then on Dec. 21 he logged in for the first time to check the new account. He put in his user name and password, and up popped someone else's Amex account -- a woman in Florida.
 ''I could see all her personal information,'' said Mr. Goldstein, who was both transfixed and fearful that he had instantaneously become a criminal. ''I could see her name, address, e-mail. I could see what banks she's with. I saw her recent shopping activity, recent payments, where she'd rented a car. She had an affinity account with a hotel chain, Starwood. I could see how to order an additional card. I could add an authorized user: me. I could change her billing address.''
 Mr. Goldstein immediately called American Express's customer service. ''I got a woman in India,'' he said, ''I explained I've hacked into someone's private account by mistake. She said she needed to hear from my wife -- my wife's the first name on the card. I said, 'Don't you at least want the information?' ''
 She didn't. When Mr. Goldstein's wife returned, they called back, reached a second person in India, who also didn't want the information but did transfer them to a representative in the United States. She didn't seem to grasp the situation, either, Mr. Goldstein said, but at least gave them a confirmation number to show that they'd reported themselves. ''I was getting testy,'' Mr. Goldstein recalled. ''I said this is serious, hacking into someone's account.'' He threatened to go to the news media. ''At that point she suggested maybe I needed to speak to a supervisor.'' Instead of a person, they got voice mail. ''I said: 'You want to call me back immediately. I mistakenly hacked into an account.' Never heard back.''
 Mr. Goldstein waited a week, went online again and was still able to gain access to the Florida woman's account. The Goldsteins then spoke to their fifth Amex customer rep, a man who, Mr. Goldstein said, did seem to grasp the seriousness. ''He said this could be criminal,'' Mr. Goldstein recalled. ''We said, 'Exactly.' '' When the Goldsteins commended him for his efforts, he asked if they would repeat that to his supervisor. ''In these times, maybe he was trying to hold on to his job,'' Mr. Goldstein said.
 The supervisor, their sixth Amex rep, said she could see that the technical people were all over it.
 The Goldsteins went on vacation to St. Croix, returned Jan. 8 and, on Jan. 9, Mr. Goldstein could still hack into the account. ''I could see all the shopping she'd done while we were gone,'' he said. ''I also saw she didn't pay her last balance and it was a lot -- over $4,000.''
 He wondered whether anyone had told this woman what had happened.
 That weekend, Mr. Goldstein laid out the saga for me (he said we had met years ago, though I had no memory of it) and on Monday morning -- exactly three weeks after the Goldsteins first tried to turn themselves in -- I called Rosa Alfonso, an Amex spokeswoman, who immediately grasped the seriousness. ''This is all I'm working on,'' she said.
 I explained that Mr. Goldstein was eager to give her the information for the hacked account. But Ms. Alfonso said the privacy issues were so sensitive that she couldn't take it herself and needed to work through a special executive customer service rep, named Ed.
 ''I told Ed the entire story,'' Mr. Goldstein later reported to me. ''Complete silence. I don't know if he was stunned or upset I was taking up so much of his time.'' Mr. Goldstein was surprised how little information Ed seemed to need from him.
 About two hours later, at 11:55 a.m., Ms. Alfonso called Mr. Goldstein back to get the Florida woman's user name and password. ''I guess Ed didn't have everything he needed,'' Mr. Goldstein said. At 1:10 p.m., Ms. Alfonso phoned Mr. Goldstein to say the problem had been fixed. ''She called it an 'isolated incident,' '' he said. ''I mentioned that each time she called me, she sounded a little better. That's when she called me 'buddy.' ''
 Ms. Alfonso confirmed Mr. Goldstein's story for me. She called the problem ''an unusual case of two customers coincidentally having nearly identical log-in information, which led one card member to inadvertently log in to another card member's account.''
 ''Our site remains secure,'' she said.
 She apologized, saying the problem should have been solved on the first call. When asked if any of the six unresponsive Amex reps had been called to account, she said, ''We are taking the appropriate steps,'' adding, ''We have rebriefed the service representatives on the appropriate processes.''
 As for the Florida woman, Ms. Alfonso said that while discussing specific cases wasn't permitted, the policy was to notify card members of such a breach.
 The one point she disputed was that Mr. Goldstein could have tampered with the authorized user and billing information. He would have needed ''additional levels of authentication -- meaning information only the true card member would have -- to make these types of changes,'' she said.
 Ms. Alfonso predicted Mr. Goldstein would have been caught by ''our sophisticated fraud controls.''
 As for Mr. Goldstein, this has confirmed his darkest fears. While young people know only an online world, boomers remember the days when customer service meant explaining your problem to the nice woman at the bank down the street. It makes us more ambivalent about technology. 
 At some point between the time the first four Amex reps failed to take care of his problem and the last two failed to, Mr. Goldstein contacted his bank and moved almost all his money out of an online savings account to a standard account.
 The HSBC service rep warned him he was losing 1 percent in interest, and Mr. Goldstein said that was perfectly fine, he was cool with that.

HEADLINE: The V Generation

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SOLOMON

 BODY:
Your new book, ''I Am an Emotional Creature,'' is a collection of 30-plus fictional monologues in which you assume the confiding, often plaintive, voices of teenage girls -- from a Chinese factory worker to a sex slave in Africa to a schoolgirl in suburban America bemoaning her lack of purple Ugg boots. Why do you see yourself as a spokeswoman for teenage girls? I don't feel like I'm a spokesperson at all for girls. I just feel like, O.K., in the way that ''The Vagina Monologues'' was an attempt to communicate stories of women and their vaginas, this is an attempt to communicate the stories of girls on the planet right now. 
 That sounds so Girl Scout-ish. I never was a scout. But maybe we can start thinking about creating a new radical troop. Troop V-Girl. 
 Why do you think you favor the form of the monologue? Do you see it as an emblem of the times -- everyone yakking, no one listening? I feel that monologues come naturally to me. I think often women are not listened to, and the monologue forces you to listen.
 In that case, do you think of the monologue as a form of coercion or even abuse? No, I don't mean force as in controlling someone. I think the monologue allows one to take up space. 
 V-Day, your foundation, has raised some $70 million since 1998, largely through benefit productions of ''The Vagina Monologues.'' I don't think of it as a foundation, but a movement. V-Day exists in 130 countries now. This year there will be about 5,000 performances in places from Paris to Brest, France, to Greece to Tanzania. 
 What is the played called in French? ''Les Monologues du Vagin.'' In Italian, it's ''I Monologhi della Vagina.'' 
 What does the V in V-Day stand for? For vagina and victory-over-violence and Valentine's Day. A lot of beautiful words begin with V -- voluptuous, vulva, volcanic, vulnerability. 
 What about vulture? Vultures serve a positive function. They clean up the dead. 
 As a self-described activist, you've made many visits to Congo. The City of Joy sounds like the name of a church. The desire was to create a name that was not about women's victimization, but about claiming their future. We'll have a radio station (we hope). We'll have a huge field that women will plant to grow their own crops; we'll have therapy; we'll have dance; we'll have theater; and women will come for six months, everything paid.
 How does a dance workshop help someone in the midst of a civil war? Dance has a transformative effect on bodily trauma. When you've been raped, the trauma lodges itself in your being. Dance is a surefire way to release it. 
 You treat everything as a problem of self-esteem, as opposed to a complex set of political and economic problems. The City of Joy is not going to end the war. But if enough leaders come out of it, maybe they'll end the war.
 Where are you from? I was born in Manhattan and grew up in Scarsdale. Scarsdale didn't work for me as a place at all.
 Are you married? No. I'm a nomad. I have a place in New York in the Flatiron District, and I have a place in Paris in Ile Saint-Louis, and I spend a lot of time in Congo. 
 Do you ever yearn for security now that you're 56? Thank you for putting my age right out there! Security isn't what I hunger for. I hunger for change. I hunger for connection. I hunger for good sex. 
 What if you just want somebody to help you find a ladder in the basement? I don't have a basement. And actually it turns out I'm fully capable of changing a light bulb all by myself.

HEADLINE: What Could You Live Without?

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
It all began with a stop at a red light.
 Kevin Salwen, a writer and entrepreneur in Atlanta, was driving his 14-year-old daughter, Hannah, back from a sleepover in 2006. While waiting at a traffic light, they saw a black Mercedes coupe on one side and a homeless man begging for food on the other.
 ''Dad, if that man had a less nice car, that man there could have a meal,'' Hannah protested. The light changed and they drove on, but Hannah was too young to be reasonable. She pestered her parents about inequity, insisting that she wanted to do something. 
 ''What do you want to do?'' her mom responded. ''Sell our house?''
 Warning! Never suggest a grand gesture to an idealistic teenager. Hannah seized upon the idea of selling the luxurious family home and donating half the proceeds to charity, while using the other half to buy a more modest replacement home. 
 Eventually, that's what the family did. The project -- crazy, impetuous and utterly inspiring -- is chronicled in a book by father and daughter scheduled to be published next month: ''The Power of Half.'' It's a book that, frankly, I'd be nervous about leaving around where my own teenage kids might find it. An impressionable child reads this, and the next thing you know your whole family is out on the street.
 At a time of enormous needs in Haiti and elsewhere, when so many Americans are trying to help Haitians by sending everything from text messages to shoes, the Salwens offer an example of a family that came together to make a difference -- for themselves as much as the people they were trying to help. In a column a week ago, I described neurological evidence from brain scans that altruism lights up parts of the brain normally associated with more primal gratifications such as food and sex. The Salwens' experience confirms the selfish pleasures of selflessness.
 Mr. Salwen and his wife, Joan, had always assumed that their kids would be better off in a bigger house. But after they downsized, there was much less space to retreat to, so the family members spent more time around each other. A smaller house unexpectedly turned out to be a more family-friendly house.
 ''We essentially traded stuff for togetherness and connectedness,'' Mr. Salwen told me, adding, ''I can't figure out why everybody wouldn't want that deal.''
 One reason for that togetherness was the complex process of deciding how to spend the money. The Salwens researched causes and charities, finally settling on the Hunger Project, a New York City-based international development organization that has a good record of tackling global poverty.
 The Salwens pledged $800,000 to sponsor health, microfinancing, food and other programs for about 40 villages in Ghana. They traveled to Ghana with a Hunger Project executive, John Coonrod, who is an inspiration in his own right. Over the years, he and his wife donated so much back from their modest aid-worker salaries that they were among the top Hunger Project donors in New York.
 The Salwens' initiative hasn't gone entirely smoothly. Hannah promptly won over her parents, but her younger brother, Joe, was (reassuringly) a red-blooded American boy to whom it wasn't intuitively obvious that life would improve by moving into a smaller house and giving money to poor people. Outvoted and outmaneuvered, Joe gamely went along.
 The Salwens also are troubled that some people are reacting negatively to their project, seeing them as sanctimonious showoffs. Or that people are protesting giving to Ghana when there are so many needy Americans.
 Still, they have inspired some converts. The people who sold the Salwens their new home were so impressed that they committed $100,000 to the project. And one of Hannah's closest friends, Blaise, pledged half of her baby-sitting savings to an environmental charity.
 In writing the book, the Salwens say, the aim wasn't actually to get people to sell their houses. They realize that few people are quite that nutty. Rather, the aim was to encourage people to step off the treadmill of accumulation, to define themselves by what they give as well as by what they possess. 
 ''No one expects anyone to sell a house,'' said Hannah, now a high school junior who hopes to become a nurse. ''That's kind of a ridiculous thing to do. For us, the house was just something we could live without. It was too big for us. Everyone has too much of something, whether it's time, talent or treasure. Everyone does have their own half, you just have to find it.''
 As for Kevin Salwen, he's delighted by what has unfolded since that encounter at the red light.
 ''This is the most self-interested thing we have ever done,'' he said. ''I'm thrilled that we can help others. I'm blown away by how much it has helped us.''

HEADLINE: A Celebrated Scout Camp on Staten Island Is in Jeopardy

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
IN the wooded heart of Staten Island lies a rugged spread of land, crowned by a rustic lake, that has provided camping grounds for Boy Scouts and Cub Scouts from the New York area for 60 years. 
 It is called Camp Pouch, and though relatively few New Yorkers know of it, in the subculture of scouting it is celebrated. Many of the 52,000 scouts in the region visit throughout the year to pitch tents; build fires; apply their half hitches, bowlines and other knots; use a compass; apply first aid; and otherwise practice sometimes old-fashioned scouting skills.
 ''You walk up to a piece of dirt and you have to make a home and a community and live together for a week'' is how William S. Kelly, a scouting official, strips the program down to its essentials. 
 But all that is now in jeopardy. In November, the Greater New York Councils of the Boy Scouts of America, the owner of the camp, announced that financial pressure might force it to put Camp Pouch on the market.
 The group, hit hard by the recession, has been operating at a deficit, and corporate and other donations have fallen by $5 million over the past 18 months -- a colossal wound for an organization that until recently ran on a $15 million budget. 
 The staff has already been cut by 40 percent, to 60 employees, and the group's space in its Empire State Building headquarters has shrunk by 60 percent. 
 The Boy Scouts hope that a conservation organization like the Trust for Public Land will buy the development rights to most of the 140-acre property, Mr. Kelly said. The sale would provide an infusion of as much as $30 million to the Boy Scouts, and the trust, a preservation group, would see to it that the land is never developed for purposes like housing. 
 The Boy Scouts, which have had conversations in recent years with the trust, would keep the lodges and cabins and use the rest of the property just as they now do.
 Trust officials confirmed that discussions have been held. 
 ''The camp is not currently for sale,'' said Mr. Kelly, 30, an Eagle Scout who is the group's spokesman. In a later interview, however, he bluntly added that if the gambit with the trust fails, the Scouts would have to sell all or part of the property. In that event, the camp might host another sprawl of houses that, at least until the recession, were consuming the borough like Pac-Man.
 Staten Islanders are closely watching the fate of Camp Pouch because it lies in the core of the borough's Greenbelt, 2,800 acres of woodlands and meadows that wind through several neighborhoods. The land includes parks, golf courses, ball fields and Moses Mountain, a 200-foot mound of rock blasted during construction of the Staten Island Expressway, a Robert Moses project. 
 The camp, which was named after William H. Pouch, a scouting advocate, is not technically part of the Greenbelt, but it helps to create a contiguous scenic expanse and a habitat for deer, owls, snakes, turtles and herons. 
 ''It would fragment the Greenbelt,'' said Kathleen Vorwick, president of the Greenbelt Conservancy, referring to any development of Camp Pouch. ''It would lose its value to humans but also to animals and flora.'' The conservancy oversees the Greenbelt along with the city's parks department.
 The loss of Camp Pouch would be most painful for the scouts. Matthew Brown, 16, a junior at New Dorp High School on Staten Island and a scout since he was 5, told how camping regularly at Pouch had taught him to put up different kinds of tents, to whittle wood with a pocketknife to help build a fire and to tie a clove hitch to drag the heavy wood needed to sustain a fire.
 As important, doing such things with 30 members of his troop had taught him how to work cooperatively. Those skills, he said, could not be learned as well in the church hall where his troop -- Troop 37 -- meets, and he and his troop would be upset to lose a vibrant patch of the natural world like Camp Pouch. 
 ''Camping outdoors is the cornerstone of scouting,'' he said. ''And at Camp Pouch we can get more in touch with the wilderness and real outdoor scouting.''
 Many troops use it not only for camping but also as a base from which to tour New York. Rich Perrone, scoutmaster of Vista Troop 101 from Lewisboro in Westchester County, visited Camp Pouch recently with his troop to see whether they could stage a bicycle tour of the city while camping there.
 After surveying the property and the five miles of roads leading to the Staten Island ferry, they decided that they could. And if the camp were sold? ''We could go to a hotel,'' Mr. Perrone said, ''but our objective is to set up our camp and use the scouting skills we stress with the boys.'' 
 The New York Scouts also own two other camps -- Ten Mile River in the Catskills town of Narrowsburg, N.Y., and Alpine, north of the George Washington Bridge in Alpine, N.J. But those sites are far from Staten Island, whose scouts are Pouch's prime consumers.
 Camp Pouch features several spots for pitching tents and other sites equipped with cabins or open-front lean-tos. There is also an archery range and a climbing wall on the grounds, as well as Ohrbach Lake (named after the department store family), where thousands of children have learned to swim and row. A store at the camp sells scouting uniforms (about $100), camping equipment and scout insignia. 
 In the summer, there is a day camp for boys and girls that can handle 500 children.
 On the drive into the campground, 12 signs display the 12 qualities of the ideal scout -- ''trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean and reverent.'' 
 On Dec. 12, a rally to save Camp Pouch drew 1,500 people, some holding signs with slogans like, ''Scouting Without Pouch ... Ouch.'' 
 The city has also been involved in discussions about rescuing the camp, said Adrian Benepe, the parks commissioner. He pointed out, however, that with agencies required to cut their capital budgets by 30 percent this year, it was highly unlikely that the city would buy the property. Instead, he said, the city might encourage a white knight, like the Trust for Public Land, to do so.
 As they confront tough fiscal times, camp and Greenbelt officials do have one ace in the hole. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is an Eagle Scout -- a lifetime distinction.

HEADLINE: German Women Cast Off a Taboo on the Way to Work

BYLINE: By KATRIN BENNHOLD

DATELINE: NEUOTTING, Germany 

 BODY:
Manuela Maier was branded a bad mother. A Rabenmutter, or raven mother, after the bird that pushes chicks out of the nest. She was ostracized by other mothers, berated by neighbors and family and screamed at in a local store.
 Her crime? Signing up her 9-year-old son Florian when the primary school first offered lunch and afternoon classes last autumn -- and returning to work.
 ''I was told: 'Why do you have children if you can't take care of them?' '' Ms. Maier, 47, recalled. By comparison, she said, having a first son out of wedlock 21 years ago raised few eyebrows in this traditional town in Bavaria, Germany's highly Catholic and conservative southern state, she said.
 Ten years into the 21st century, most primary and secondary schools in Europe's biggest economy still end before lunch, typically around 1 p.m., a tradition that dates back nearly 250 years. It has powerfully sustained the homemaker-mother image of German lore and was long credited with producing well-bred, well-read burghers. 
 Modern Germany may be run by a woman -- Chancellor Angela Merkel, routinely called the world's most powerful woman in politics -- but it seems no coincidence that she is childless.
 The half-day school system survived feudalism, the rise and demise of Hitler's mother cult, the women's movement of the 1970s and reunification with East Germany.
 Now, in the face of economic necessity, it is crumbling: one of the lowest birthrates in the world, the specter of labor shortages and slipping educational standards have prompted a reconsideration. Since 2003, nearly a fifth of Germany's 40,000 schools have phased in afternoon programs, and more plan to follow suit.
 ''This is a taboo we just can't afford anymore,'' said Ursula von der Leyen, the German labor minister. ''The country needs women to be able to both work and have children.'' A mother of seven and a doctor-turned-politician, Ms. von der Leyen baffles homemakers and childless career women alike, not to mention many men in her Christian Democrat Party.
 For her, the spread of all-day schooling in Germany is ''irreversible,'' as women flock into the work force, whether they seek fulfillment, are single mothers or have partners whose income cannot sustain a family alone. In Germany, one-fifth of households depend on the income of women.
 This trend makes child care a question of competitiveness, notes Karen Hagemann, a professor of European and gender history at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. ''High birthrates and female employment rates tend to move together,'' said Ms. Hagemann, an expert on Germany's system. ''Child care and a school system that covers the working day is key.''
 In 1763, Prussia was the first country to make education compulsory for the lower classes. The half-day system evolved in an era that depended on child labor. By the time France and Britain set up all-day systems a century later, the German way -- which survives in Austria and parts of Switzerland -- had grown deep roots.
 Germany's middle classes long believed that they, not the state, should round out children's general culture. No school, the thinking went, could improve on a mother.
 Edith Brunner, 41, is that increasingly rare German model mother. A qualified tax adviser and mother of four, she went to part-time work after her first child and then gave up her job altogether. She spends afternoons checking homework and shuttling from flute and piano lessons to soccer training and gymnastics. Her husband is a well-paid physicist.
 But the system discouraged more highly educated women from having children; by their mid-40s, one in three German women lives in a childless household, which gives Germany, along with Austria, the highest proportion of such households in Europe.
 The old ways also were ill adapted to a Germany in which rising numbers of students were immigrants, many of whom needed more help in basic skills. In 2001, a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of the world's most developed democracies with market-based economies, of the literacy skills of 15-year-olds stunned Germany by ranking it 21st out of 27, and near the bottom in terms of social mobility. Two years later, the government made $5.7 billion available to introduce all-day programs at 10,000 of the country's 40,000 schools by 2009; 7,200 schools took part.
 Mothers have responded strongly. Wolfgang Gruber of the Bavarian education authority uses words like ''flood'' and ''avalanche'' to describe demand for afternoon schooling. Between 2006 and 2009, only 40 primary schools in Bavaria converted. This school year, the number of all-day programs rose to 150. The aim is afternoon classes in 540 of the 2,300 primary schools, Mr. Gruber said. 
 And yet, the transition is not without its difficult moments, as Ms. Maier discovered. A caregiver for the elderly, Ms. Maier jumped at the chance of afternoon school but was soon taken aback by the reaction of some other mothers. In October, as she was shopping for a washing machine, she was accosted by the mother of one of her son's friends who shouted insults.
 But she said the sneers soon turned to sheepish questions about her son's exciting afternoon activities. Several parents tried to sign up in the middle of the term, but the program was already oversubscribed. Even the angry mother has become quite friendly, Ms. Maier said.
 In 2008, 64 percent of German women were working, compared with 66 percent in the United States, according to O.E.C.D. figures. But for mothers with children under 12 the figure plunges to 38 percent, compared with 55 percent in France and 77 percent in Sweden, according to figures cited in a 2006 article by Ms. Hagemann. Only 14 percent of women with one child return to full-time work and only 6 percent of those with two. The birthrate is stuck at 1.38 children per woman.
 Berlin is the only city in Germany where every primary school offers afternoon schooling. In the former East Germany, with its Communist-era tradition of generous child care measures, 37 percent of under-3-year-olds have nursery places, compared with 3 percent in Germany's western regions.
 That history of ideological conflict held things back, Ms. von der Leyen, the labor minister, said. ''Day care and all-day schools were long synonymous with Communism,'' she said. 
 But now, those same amenities are luring westerners like Urte Dally and her husband, Ortwin, who moved to Berlin in 1994. Their daughters, ages 11 and 8, attend a school from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., and parents get child care from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday to Friday, and on holidays.
 As family minister in Ms. Merkel's first term, Ms. von der Leyen introduced tax credits for private child care, more nursery places and her signature measure, ''parent money,'' which can sound almost unfathomable to Americans, who are used to paying for private child care.
 Under parent money, mothers and fathers are entitled to a total of 14 months of parental leave at 67 percent of their salary. The months can be apportioned any way the parents want, as long as the father takes at least two. If the father takes less than two months -- one in five now do -- the government pays only for 12.
 At Siemens, the 163-year-old industrial symbol of Germany Inc., 638 employees took ''father months'' in 2008. Last year, 964 followed suit.
 The move toward all-day schooling and child care is just part of a broader shift in Germany. With demographers predicting a shortfall of 200,000 engineers in Germany by 2017, Siemens is courting women, and mothers, with reserved places in day care and high school science camps for girls.
 Currently, 21 percent of Siemens' staff in Germany is female, but among new recruits the proportion rises to 34 percent. Siemens is the only top 30 German company with a woman on its eight-person management board -- Barbara Kux, 55, unmarried and childless.
 If women's advancement to date has been accepted by men, might conflict loom as calls for next steps -- boardroom quotas and mandatory paternity leave -- grow louder?
 ''Many obstacles remain, and a backlash is always possible,'' said Ms. Hagemann, the history professor. But, in Germany and elsewhere, once unthinkable notions are now being entertained. ''All change,'' she said, ''starts with a change in the head.''

HEADLINE: She Works. They're Happy.

BYLINE: By TARA PARKER-POPE. 
Tara Parker-Pope writes the Well column for The New York Times and is the author of ''For Better: The Science of a Good Marriage,'' to be released May 6 by Dutton.

 BODY:
EVER since Betty Friedan urged women to leave the house and pursue careers, people have argued over whether women's marriages and romantic prospects would suffer for it. Was a financially successful woman a threat to her husband or a relief?
 Last week, a report from the Pew Research Center about what it called ''the rise of wives'' revived the debate. Based on a study of Census data, Pew found that in nearly a third of marriages, the wife is better educated than her husband. And though men, over all, still earn more than women, wives are now the primary breadwinner in 22 percent of couples, up from 7 percent in 1970.
 While the changing economic roles of husbands and wives may take some getting used to, the shift has had a surprising effect on marital stability. Over all, the evidence shows that the shifts within marriages -- men taking on more housework and women earning more outside the home -- have had a positive effect, contributing to lower divorce rates and happier unions. 
 ''Women no longer need to marry up educationally or economically, so they are more likely to pick men who support a more egalitarian relationship,'' said Stephanie Coontz, director of research and education for the Council on Contemporary Families and author of ''Marriage, A History: How Love Conquered Marriage.'' 
 She pointed to herself as an example. ''In my marriage, I have more education and, because he's retired, more income,'' she said. ''I picked him not because I needed a meal ticket, but because I liked the fact that he respected me and had no problem sharing the responsibilities of daily life with me. More and more women now are able to make those choices.''
 The changing roles in marriage often aren't what many couples plan, but instead are a reaction to unexpected financial pressures. That's what happened to Cynthia and Brian Walder of West Springfield, Mass., who had four children in five years. Although her first and second pregnancies were carefully planned, a surprise set of twin boys meant that their day care costs would be prohibitive if both parents kept their jobs. ''Someone had to leave their job and stay home,'' said Ms. Walder, who is 34. 
 Her marketing job with an insurance firm provided the family's health benefits, so about a year ago, Mr. Walder, a 36-year-old real estate broker and consultant, opted to stay home. ''It was stressful,'' he said. ''If you'd asked me five years ago would I be in this spot, I'd say 'No way.' ''
 While it's widely believed that a woman's financial independence increases her risk for divorce, divorce rates in the United States tell a different story: they have fallen as women have made economic gains. The rate peaked at 23 divorces per 1,000 couples in the late 1970s, but has since dropped to fewer than 17 divorces per 1,000 couples. Today, the statistics show that typically, the more economic independence and education a woman gains, the more likely she is to stay married. And in states where fewer wives have paid jobs, divorce rates tend to be higher, according to a 2009 report from the Center for American Progress.
 Sociologists and economists say that financially independent women can be more selective in marrying, and they also have more negotiating power within the marriage. But it's not just women who win. The net result tends to be a marriage that is more fair and equitable to husbands and wives.
 The changes are not without their challenges. ''With women taking on more earning and men taking on more caring, there's a lot of shifting and juggling,'' said Andrea Doucet, a sociology professor at Carleton University in Ottawa. Her study, the Bread and Roses Project, tracks couples in the United States and Canada in which women are the primary breadwinners. But the dynamic is ''not as easy as you'd think it would be,'' she said. ''You can't just reverse the genders.''
 Men, for instance, sometimes have a hard time adjusting to a woman's equal or greater earning power. Women, meanwhile, struggle with giving up their power at home and controlling tasks like how to dress the children or load the dishwasher.
 Linda Duxbury, a professor at the Sprott School of Business at Carleton University, recalls moments in her marriage when she was hesitant to give up control.
 ''My husband would dress our daughter for school, and I'd say, 'Oh my God, she looks like a clown,' '' Professor Duxbury recalled. ''He would say, 'That's your hang-up. She's happy in it. If you don't like my choice, then you do it.' '' 
 She added, ''In many ways women are their own worst enemies -- we want men to do it, but we want to tell them how they should do it.''
 Men, meanwhile, can struggle with the social expectation that husbands should always be the breadwinner. The recession, among other things, has made that expectation less realistic.
 ''Today, men need their wives' income,'' says Joshua Coleman, a psychologist in San Francisco who wrote ''The Lazy Husband: How to Get Men to Do More Parenting and Housework.'' ''There is an issue for men of: 'What is my value here if I'm not bringing in money? I understand you want a communicative, empathic guy who does housework and parenting, but how much pride can I take in that?' '' 
 A magazine editor in New York, who asked not to be named to respect her husband's privacy, said that during her 10-year marriage, her husband lost his job, and her higher income became a regular source of tension. 
 ''All of the sudden, I was bringing in all the money,'' she said. ''It was difficult to find a balance between trying to be supportive and nurturing and saying, 'But we really need cash so, honey, could you take a part-time job?' '' 
 Then he suggested she get an M.B.A. to increase her earning power. ''I remember thinking at the time, 'I'd hate that, and why does he think I need to have a dumb job just to make a lot of money?' '' she said. ''It put doubt in my mind: maybe there is a part of him very comfortable with me making the lion's share of the money long term.''
 Kristen W. Springer, a sociologist at Rutgers, has found that among men in their 50s, having a wife who earns more money is associated with poorer health. Among the highest earning couples in her study, a husband who earns less than his wife is 60 percent less likely to be in good health compared with men who earn more than their wives.
 And despite the sweeping economic changes in marriage over the last 40 years, all is not equal. Even among dual-earning couples, women still do about two-thirds of the housework, on average, according to the University of Wisconsin National Survey of Families and Households. But men do contribute far more than they used to. Studies show that since the 1960s, men's contributions to housework have doubled, while the amount of time spent caring for children has tripled.
 And the blurring of traditional gender roles appears to have a positive effect. Lynn Prince Cooke, a sociology professor at the University of Kent in England, has found that American couples who share employment and housework responsibilities are less likely to divorce compared with couples where the man is the sole breadwinner. 
 Mr. Walder, who stayed home with his four young children, said it was challenging to set up a new daily routine. ''In most instances the wife is the one who makes the decisions when it comes to the kids, and the husband follows the lead,'' he said. ''It's weird to swap that role.''
 His wife said she found it difficult to cede her role as the parent in charge. ''It took me awhile to get to that point where I didn't feel like I had to be at every doctor's appointment or supervising and laying out a specific lists of chores,'' she said. 
 But today, the Walders say the experiment has been a blessing. Most days, Mr. Walder takes the children to the library, playgroups or the museum. He handles light cleaning and laundry on weekdays and usually makes dinner. On weekends, Ms. Walder takes a bigger role with the children and does heavy cleaning, shopping and meal planning. 
 ''I think she has the harder job,'' Mr. Walder said. ''If you asked me a year ago, I had the harder job. But now that I've got it, I love it. I wouldn't want to give it up.''
 Mothers tend to shower him with praise. ''I get the same reaction from all the moms,'' he said. ''They say, 'That's great, my husband wouldn't be able to do it.' I think they're selling their husbands short. All guys could do it, just like all women can be the breadwinners.''

HEADLINE: A Buck for Your Vote, Sir? (Prove It)

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- ''There are two things that are important in politics,'' Mark Hanna, the great Republican kingmaker of the late 19th century, once said. ''The first thing is money, and I can't remember what the second one is.''
 What was true in Hanna's century remained true in the next, and since the Watergate scandal of the 1970s, Congress has imposed stricter regulations on money in politics. Advocates of those rules argue that they rein in corruption and increase public trust in government. 
 But after more than three decades, has the system made a difference?
 The question took on new urgency last week as the Supreme Court threw out regulations that prohibited corporations from buying campaign commercials that explicitly advocate the election or defeat of candidates. Democrats called the ruling a threat to democracy; Republicans cheered it as a victory for free speech.
 Legal scholars and social scientists say the evidence is meager, at best, that the post-Watergate campaign finance system has accomplished the broad goals its supporters asserted.
 Justice Anthony M. Kennedy noted in his opinion that no evidence was marshaled in 100,000 pages of legal briefs to show that unrestricted campaign money ever bought a lawmaker's vote. And even after Congress further tightened the rules with the landmark McCain-Feingold law in 2002, banning hundreds of millions of dollars in unlimited contributions to the political parties, public trust in government fell to new lows, according to polls.
 And what about the corporations that contributed so much of that money? A review of the biggest corporate donors found that their stock prices were unaffected after they stopped giving to the parties. The results suggest that those companies did not lose their influence and may have been giving ''because they were shaken down by politicians,'' said Nathaniel Persily, a professor at Columbia Law School who has studied the law's impact.
 ''There is no evidence that stricter campaign finance rules reduce corruption or raise positive assessments of government,'' said Kenneth Mayer, a professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. ''It seems like such an obvious relationship but it has proven impossible to prove.''
 It is not merely an academic question. The Supreme Court has consistently said that only fighting corruption or the appearance of corruption justifies laws that restrict political spending. Other rationales -- like leveling the playing field between the haves and have-nots -- are not enough.
 Defenders of the rules say their case for tighter restrictions on campaign money is obvious to anyone who knows Washington. Private influence-seekers shower big contributions on politicians because they want to gain access and shape policy; they would not spend the money if they got nothing in return.
 But even supporters of the rules acknowledge that the benefits can be hard to measure. ''I happen to think the campaign finance laws have done some modest good,'' said Richard L. Hasen, an expert on political law at the Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. ''How much good? We may soon find out,'' he added, in the aftermath of the Supreme Court's ruling on Thursday in Citizens United v. the Federal Election Commission.
 Supporters of the restrictions point to Britain to show that governments can police corruption without imperiling free speech. Britain started regulating political spending as far back as 1883 and has tightened the rules steadily ever since.
 Those British restrictions would violate the Supreme Court's view of the First Amendment, yet Britain's political debates are as robust as they are in the United States.
 Opponents of restrictions, on the other hand, point out that Australia barely regulates political money. Individuals and corporations can give without limit. Parties can spend freely. And there is not much disclosure about who gives what to whom. But political corruption has not threatened a vibrant democracy there.
 In the United States, studies comparing states like Virginia with scant regulation against those like Wisconsin with strict rules have not found much difference in levels of corruption or public trust, several scholars said. Jeff Milyo, an economist at the University of Missouri, has compared states with strict bans on corporate contributions to political parties against those with no limits at all. ''There is just no good evidence that campaign finance laws have any effect on actual corruption,'' he said.
 The most insistent advocates of the campaign finance laws argue that the benefits are real even if academics can't measure them. Fred Wertheimer, the dean of campaign finance ''reformers,'' pointed to the presidential campaign finance system as the best example of success. For five elections beginning in 1976, the presidential candidates of both major parties took public financing and did not receive private campaign contributions. ''You can't prove a negative,'' Mr. Wertheimer said, ''but in the Carter and Reagan presidencies there were no news stories about campaign contributions influencing presidential decisions.''
 By the 2008 election, however, that system had grown obsolete. Candidates could raise far more from private donors, and President Obama became the first major candidate since Richard M. Nixon to win election without public money.
 Polls have shown that relatively few people understand or are even aware of the campaign finance rules. Those who are aware of them usually assume that smart donors will be able to steer around the rules. But Mr. Wertheimer said that a cat-and-mouse game of election rule-makers forever trying to catch up with the latest evasions by big money donors was only natural, ''part of the ongoing battle to prevent government corruption.''
 But some politicians say reformers like Mr. Wertheimer are unrealistic about how money and politicians mix. They cite an old political maxim, attributed in a more vulgar form to the onetime California kingpin Jesse Unruh: If you can't take their money and vote against them, you don't belong in politics.

HEADLINE: A Community for Retirees of the Comfortable Class

BYLINE: By IRWIN ARIEFF

 BODY:
ROUND-THE-CLOCK NURSING? You've got it. Alzheimer's support? Ditto. Cocktail lounge and valet parking? But of course.
 Dangling such amenities as lures, the Club at Briarcliff Manor, a super-luxury retirement community, is making a play for baby boomers who have means. With entrance fees of up to $2 million and housing options that will include 3,200-square-foot ''villas,'' the club won't be for everyone. 
 Scheduled to open in 2013, the club will sit on 59 acres in affluent Westchester County, 30 miles north of Manhattan. If all goes as planned, residents will have their own tennis courts, health spa, Tudor-style clubhouse, gardens, surround-sound theater, hiking trails, indoor pool, business center and multiple restaurants -- along with that cocktail lounge. 
 Sixty-five people have already put down deposits, said Matthew K. Phillips, the chief executive officer of the Integrated Development Group of Northbrook, Ill., the firm that is leading the $350 million project.
 The club will have 325 independent-living residences -- 13 detached houses, 24 town homes and 288 apartments.
 Rather than buy a home, residents will pay entrance fees of about $750,000 to about $2 million, which will be 90 percent refundable upon leaving the community or dying. Monthly fees, starting at about $3,400, will cover amenities like weekly housekeeping, maintenance services, access to the pool and tennis courts, and property taxes. 
 Neither the entrance fee nor the monthly fees cover assisted living services. ''Thus, if you do not need care, you will not pay for the care and your monthly fee will not subsidize the care others receive,'' according to the development's Web site (theclubbcm.com).
 The assisted living center will offer an additional 60 apartments with 24-hour skilled nursing and Alzheimer's care available on a fee-for-service basis.
 The high-end club is being built as construction is near a standstill in Westchester County and as other retirement communities find themselves financially stressed by the economic climate. 
 ''It is fascinating that this effort continues to be able to move on at that financial level,'' said Elinor F. Ginzler, the senior vice president for livable communities for AARP. ''I am sure they are planning on affluent boomers, and we know that boomers are going to need as many housing options as they can possibly get a hold of, because they like to do things their own way, so the more variety, the better.'' But, she added, the $2 million entrance fee ''is the highest I have heard lately.'' 
 The residences, with their high-end finishes and appliances, along with expansive living spaces and common areas, ''are going to make us the preferred brand in this marketplace,'' Mr. Phillips said. ''One of the reasons we really like this business is we believe in the long term; over the next 10 to 20 years, that market is going to continue to grow as the baby boomers age.''
 To finance the project, Integrated partnered with the National Electrical Benefit Fund (NEBF), a pension fund with more than $10 billion in assets set up by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and the National Electrical Contractors Association. 
 ''We hope to secure a $250 million construction loan,'' said Kathryn A. Barnes, an executive of National Real Estate Advisors, an investment adviser to the fund. The balance, she said, will be an investment by NEBF and the developers, ''the vast majority of which will be coming from NEBF.''
 Plans for the community date back to more robust economic times. It took about five years for the village of Briarcliff Manor to grant the necessary zoning changes; approval of the site plan took a few more years, Mr. Phillips said. Licensing for the continuing-care facilities also had to be secured, he said.
 ''You have to have a long-term view to this,'' Mr. Phillips said, adding that part of the project's value to its developers at this stage was knowing how hard it would be for competitors to go through the same process. 
 Ms. Barnes, the adviser to the pension fund, is also taking the long view. ''There is demonstrated demand for this market segment, '' she said, ''and demonstrated limited supply, so those two things together make this a very attractive investment for us.''

HEADLINE: Three Faces Of Market Danger

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a senior editor at Money magazine. E-mail: fund@nytimes.com

 BODY:
AFTER one of the most volatile periods for stocks in decades, it's only natural for investors to wonder how risky the markets will be in 2010.
 Unfortunately, that is impossible to predict with any certainty. But investors can at least look for the types of risks the market seems most likely to face. Those perceived dangers have shifted in recent years. In 2008, for example, there was the all-too-real risk of losing big money in the global credit crisis. Last year, after the crisis seemed to subside, investors who stayed on the sidelines risked missing out on the market's huge rebound.
 Today, strategists say, investors face risks in three major categories: 
 EARNINGS RISK As the economy started to heal last year, investor expectations for corporate profits started to grow. That helped to drive up equity prices by 65 percent from March 9 to Dec. 31. 
 But after a rally of that magnitude, ''people will start to get nervous about the ability of companies to actually meet those expectations,'' said Ben Inker, director of asset allocation at GMO, an asset management firm in Boston. That is partly because corporate profit forecasts have grown so lofty.
 Wall Street analysts estimate that earnings for companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index were up 193 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009, versus the period a year earlier, according to a survey by Thomson Financial. Moreover, they expect earnings for all of 2010 to be up more than 28 percent from 2009.
 ''While we are seeing profit improvement, we think the numbers that are getting baked in are excessive,'' Mr. Inker said.
 Michele Gambera, chief economist at Ibbotson Associates, an investment consulting firm in Chicago, points out that ''it's hard to have a stable improvement of corporate profits in an environment where companies are deleveraging.'' 
 It's also difficult to see profits soaring, he said, while the employment outlook is so weak. Not only does a struggling job market threaten consumer spending, it also exacerbates continuing problems in the financial system. ''If people don't have jobs, they cannot pay off their debts,'' Mr. Gambera said. 
 VALUATION RISK When the market began to rally in March, stocks were roundly considered cheap. Back then, the price-to-earnings ratio for equities was a mere 13.3, based on 10-year averaged earnings, as calculated by Robert J. Shiller, the Yale economist.
 But thanks to the recent surge in stock prices, the market P/E has jumped to a much frothier 20.8, versus the historical average of around 16.
 ''Current market valuations are high enough that they're more or less suggesting everything is going to be fine this year,'' said Robert D. Arnott, chairman of Research Affiliates, an investment management firm in Newport Beach, Calif. But if everything isn't -- if the economy hits a speed bump, for instance, or if corporate profits come in lower than expected -- investors may start to question the prices they are paying for risky assets, he said.
 This is why James W. Paulsen, who works in Minneapolis as chief investment strategist for Wells Capital Management, says that this year, unlike 2008 and 2009, ''it will be important for people to go back to assessing valuations again.''
 POLICY RISK Government economic policies are having a huge impact, but they can be tricky to predict. For instance, investors who were banking on imminent health care reform may need to rethink their strategy after the special Senate election last week in Massachusetts.
 Health care is only one area that is up for grabs. This year, for example, the government and the Federal Reserve Board will face a big decision on whether to curtail the huge stimulus that has helped prop up the economy.
 Mr. Arnott says he believes the Fed will be forced to raise short-term interest rates this year, possibly even before the recovery gains full traction. 
 The danger is that the markets may react badly to the end of the Fed's unusually loose monetary policy. 
 ''It's not like the economy is out of the woods,'' said Duncan W. Richardson, chief equity investment officer at Eaton Vance, an asset manager in Boston. ''The patient is still in the hospital.''
 INVESTORS must also keep in mind that the tax cuts enacted under President George W. Bush -- which lowered the maximum rate on long-term capital gains taxes to 15 percent from 20 percent and the top dividend tax rate to 15 percent from 39.6 percent -- are due to expire at year-end.
 While it is unclear whether the Obama administration will extend those cuts, or at least extend them for the middle class, the uncertainty is bound to raise concerns on Wall Street.
 Because of the ''potentially big risks that may come out of Washington,'' Mr. Richardson said, ''investors need to be more diversified than ever.''

HEADLINE: Why Is A Utility Paying Customers?

BYLINE: By KATE GALBRAITH

DATELINE: BOISE, Idaho 

 BODY:
 FOUR decades ago, when Sid Erwin began his career as an inspector at the Idaho Power Company, a string of new hydroelectric plants was pumping out power faster than locals could buy it. Soon enough, Mr. Erwin recalls, the utility began sending representatives to rural areas, urging farmers to use more electricity when irrigating their crops.
 These days, Idaho's farmers are being paid to stop using power.
 Sitting at a cluttered kitchen table in his home, Mr. Erwin -- now a farmer himself -- waved a bill showing that last July he received a credit of more than $700 from Idaho Power for turning off his power-guzzling pumps on some summer afternoons. 
 ''It's a total turnabout,'' says Mr. Erwin, who lives in Bruneau, about 60 miles southeast of here. ''I'm almost 70 years old and this has been a lifelong education to me.''
 As saving energy becomes a rallying cry for utilities and the government, Idaho Power is in the vanguard. Since 2004, it has been paying farmers like Mr. Erwin to cut power use at crucial times, resulting in drop-offs of as much as 5.6 percent of peak power demand. 
 In a related program, it pays homeowners to turn off their air-conditioners briefly at times of high demand. 
 Other efficiency initiatives by the utility, including one promoting attic insulation, have saved about 500,000 megawatt-hours of power since 2002, according to the company -- roughly equal to the amount used by 5,000 gadget-filled homes over eight years. 
 To pay for these and other energy-saving measures, Idaho customers -- individuals and companies -- are charged a 4.75 percent ''energy efficiency'' rider on their electric bills, one of the highest percentage charges of this kind in the country. 
 ''It's clearly iconic in terms of a utility that's turned the corner,'' says Tom Eckman, the manager of conservation resources with the Northwest Power and Conservation Council, a planning group created by Congress. ''They have gone from pretty much ground zero to a fairly aggressive program level.'' 
 The company's efforts are especially striking given that the push for energy efficiency is generally associated with coastal states like California and Massachusetts, not with a state whose electric rates are among the lowest in the country.
 But the concept has rung true for Idaho's farmers, anglers and snowbirds -- outdoor types who have helped keep the state nearly free of coal plants. They have been largely receptive to the utility's arguments that it is cheaper to save energy than to build new power plants. 
 ''Every time they would build a plant, it would raise our rates,'' says Terry Ketterling, a farmer in Mountain Home, Idaho, who grows sugar beets, corn, wheat and alfalfa and who, like Mr. Erwin, participates in the irrigation payment program.
 Energy experts say Idaho Power's efforts can be replicated by other power companies across the country. Steve Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, an advocacy group, estimates that about half of utilities now run programs that pay customers to cut use during peak periods. And companies like Enernoc, based in Boston, have sprung up that help utilities by outfitting stores and other businesses with devices to turn off lights or reduce power in other ways during a power squeeze. 
 But most utilities spend a much lower proportion of their revenue on saving energy than Idaho Power, says Ralph Cavanagh, a senior lawyer at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group. 
 LaMont Keen, the C.E.O. of Idaho Power, acknowledges that the company, with its large cohort of farmers, has a different customer base than most other power companies. Still, he argues that the success of his programs shows that even utilities with large industrial loads can adapt.
 ''With the right incentives, people can and will modify their behavior in ways that are beneficial,'' he says.
 The utility also has its share of critics: Big businesses sometimes wince at paying the efficiency charge. And some say the utility has dragged its feet when it comes to renewable energy -- other than that generated by huge dams. Some detractors refer to Idaho as the ''hole in the doughnut'' on wind power -- because most of its neighbors, like Oregon, Washington and Wyoming, have built far more wind farms.
 ''Very little has been developed in Idaho in the past six or seven years, whereas all the states around us have blossomed,'' says Kiki Tidwell, a self-described ''Republican soccer mom'' near Hailey, Idaho. Ms. Tidwell helped push through a shareholders' resolution to urge Idaho Power to plan for a low-carbon future. 
 To the surprise of even Ms. Tidwell, it passed last May, with 52 percent of the votes.
 Mr. Keen notes that hydro is a clean resource and says Idaho Power -- a subsidiary of the publicly listed Idacorp that serves parts of Oregon as well as most of Idaho -- is working to ramp up wind production and reduce the carbon intensity of its operations. 
 IDAHO POWER has been used to getting its way: it's an old joke around Boise that Idaho is the only state named for a power company.
 Until recently, getting its way meant adding power, which was cheap and plentiful, thanks in part to several new dams completed in the late 1950s and '60s. (One of them, called Hells Canyon, was where Mr. Erwin spent his younger days checking on cables and fittings during construction.)
 A nasty shock arrived in 2000 and 2001, when peak-time energy prices on the open market rose about tenfold -- not counting steeper, temporary spikes. The Western energy crisis was under way, with market manipulation woes in California compounded by a dry stretch for Idaho's dams.
 ''Everything turned a full 180,'' Ric Gale, the utility's vice president for regulatory affairs, said in an interview in Idaho Power's blocklike Boise headquarters, which is itself undergoing a floor-by-floor green retrofit.
 Idaho Power and regulators held emergency meetings, and customers were soon hit with a temporary rate increase of about 44 percent. The utility paid big irrigators to shut down their electric pumps for the summer of 2001, figuring it would be cheaper than buying the power at high prices. An enormous phosphate plant in Pocatello was also in effect paid to temporarily shut down one of its energy-guzzling furnaces. The move hurt sales, and the company, FMC, decided later that year to close the plant permanently.
 To avoid being caught short again, Idaho Power decided to give energy-saving measures a try. Another push came from the state's Public Utilities Commission, which ordered Idaho Power in 2001 to refocus on energy efficiency -- something the utility had dabbled in during the 1990s. 
 PERHAPS more than any other group, Idaho's farmers have experienced at first hand the effects of the utility's transformation. Though Idaho's economy has diversified in recent years, more than a fifth of its land is devoted to farming -- not only to grow Idaho's world-famous potatoes, but also crops like alfalfa, triticale and oat hay, all of which Mr. Erwin grows.
 Vast amounts of energy are required to pump water up to the state's plains from the Snake River or from wells. The largest farms can use as much electricity as several thousand homes. During the summer, big farms keep their pumps on nearly 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
 Until the 1970s, many farmers used gas-powered engines to force water uphill, according to Mr. Erwin. But by offering steep discounts, Idaho Power convinced many of them to put in electric pumps and use them to move water up even taller slopes; the discounts are still in effect. Irrigation accounts for 12 percent of Idaho Power's electricity load over all -- and 23 percent during peak periods. 
 That's why, in recent years, Idaho Power decided that farmers could help it reduce the load on sunny summer days, when air-conditioners and other gadgets are on, by turning off their pumps for up to 15 hours a week.
 This concept, called demand response, has gained traction in utility circles. In essence, it involves paying users to make small sacrifices when there is an urgent need for extra power (the ''peak''). The utility can then rely on cutting some demand on its system at crucial times -- and, in theory, avoid the cost of building a new plant just to meet those peak needs. 
 Over the course of the day, Mr. Gale says, ''you can actually see the peak drop off when the program kicks in.'' 
 For farmers, however, this process isn't easy. Workers must be dispatched to turn the pumps on and off, and there is a risk of crop damage. ''I may save on power, but it may cost me some on crop,'' says Mr. Ketterling, who pumps water up more than 600 feet from the Snake River. He spends about $1.8 million a year on electricity and estimates he shaved more than 30 percent off his bill over a six-week period last year by participating in the program.
 Ordinary consumers have also been called upon to help with efficiency. These days, most utilities enclose fliers with monthly bills that offer energy-saving tips for appliances and light bulbs, but Idaho Power seems to have taken the campaign to an extreme.
 Just before Christmas, the utility bought ads in newspapers flagging ''naughty or nice'' holiday gifts: an electric charger for a mobile device, for example, was ''naughty,'' but a solar charger was ''nice.'' Last October, Idaho Power offered free classes to Boise residents featuring energy-saving tips for cooking (ever tried a solar oven?) and demonstrations on sealing ducts.
 Another program, begun last June after a yearlong pilot version, pays individuals 15 cents for each square foot of insulation they put in their attics. ''That was a no-brainer,'' said Courtney Washburn, a Boise resident who works for the Idaho Conservation League and who received a letter from Idaho Power promoting the insulation rebate. 
 Ms. Washburn also participates in the utility's ''demand response'' program for air-conditioners. More than 32,000 Idaho Power households (out of nearly 407,000 total) have allowed the utility to control their air-conditioners at crucial times. 
 On a hot summer day, Idaho Power can in essence push a switch that causes devices installed on participating air-conditioning units, like Ms. Washburn's, to cycle on and off for intervals as long as 15 minutes. Ms. Washburn says she has noticed no difference in temperature, even though a sweltering day is exactly when people want their air-conditioning most. Executives say the program lowers use during peak periods by about 1 percent. Participants are paid $7 a month during the summer. 
 Ms. Washburn says her electric bill has dropped by about 30 percent as a result of the attic insulation and the $7 credit.
 FACED with a fast-growing population, Idaho Power has been unable to avoid building new power plants altogether; a new natural gas plant is in the works. But executives are pressing ahead with efficiency measures. The utility is asking regulators to make permanent a pilot program started in 2007 that allows Idaho Power to raise rates to make up for selling less power.
 (This concept is known as decoupling and is celebrated by energy-efficiency advocates; Idaho was one of the first states to adopt it, after California, though Idaho Power's large industrial customers are so far exempt from the rate adjustments.)
 But the aggressive pursuit of efficiency has prompted concerns in some quarters. Ray Stark, senior vice president of the Boise Metro Chamber of Commerce, says that not long ago a few companies, including a chemical producer, that had been considering operations in the state were told by Idaho Power that there was insufficient capacity to accommodate their power needs. 
 ''That concerns us a great deal because we want to be competitive for economic development projects,'' said Mr. Stark, adding that he supports the efficiency push. 
 Mr. Gale said that capacity constraints were unrelated to the drive to save energy and that utilities can't always quickly accommodate a big new customer. 
 The rising efficiency charges have also raised corporate eyebrows. Don Sturtevant, the energy manager for the J. R. Simplot Company, the potato processor, said he cringed when Idaho Power raised the charge last June to 4.75 percent from 2.5 percent, though he said the company benefited from the program.
 If the utility raises the charge again, Mr. Sturtevant said, ''it's going to be a challenge.''

HEADLINE: From a Dutch Painter, Works With Much to Say

BYLINE: By BENJAMIN GENOCCHIO

 BODY:
 As the Hudson Valley has celebrated the 400th anniversary of its discovery by Henry Hudson in a Dutch expedition, art exhibitions focusing on contemporary Dutch culture have been especially rich. ''Fendry Ekel -- The Witness,'' a show of a dozen works in its final week at the Hudson Valley Center for Contemporary Art, is among them. 
 Born in Jakarta, Indonesia, in 1971, Mr. Ekel, who has never exhibited before in this country, lives in Amsterdam, where he belongs to an artists' collective that includes the sculptor Folkert de Jong. Mr. Ekel is primarily a painter, producing colorful works on paper that mix media and techniques, including gouache, acrylic painting and drawing.
 Each of the paintings being shown here is well crafted and attractively presented in the mezzanine gallery. While there is nothing especially innovative about the style -- a loose expressionistic realism -- the content gives you pause for thought, and the economical use of symbolic imagery gives the pictures raw visual force.
 As a starting point for viewing the exhibition, I would encourage visitors to dip into the excellent, informative catalog. It helps explain the social, political and cultural underpinnings of the works. Mr. Ekel has a great deal to say about the world we live in, not much of it positive.
 Take ''The Dutchman Willem Oltmans as George Washington'' (2008), a cartoonish painting of a middle-aged white man with blond hair dressed up as the first president. It is at a glance an innocuous-looking portrait, reminding you a little of an Andy Warhol screen print. 
 But this work has a political message. Reading about the painting in the exhibition catalog, we learn that Mr. Oltmans, who died in 2004, was a Dutch journalist with political connections to the Sukarno regime in Indonesia. In Mr. Ekel's eyes, he was a powerful figure who helped change the destiny of a nation.
 ''Willem Oltmans'' is one of the show's few portraits. The artist mostly paints late-20th-century buildings and architectural interiors, conveyed with a minimum of detail and information. This makes them seem oddly simple but mysterious.
 Several paintings here depict the Century 21 department store and the nearby Millennium Hilton hotel in Lower Manhattan. They were done in 2006, based on snapshots. They are impressionistic night scenes, denuded of people, capturing reflections and the play of light.
 The paintings are linked to the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center, once located across the street from Century 21, for the memory of what happened on 9/11 continues to resonate in the stone and glass of surviving buildings nearby. Mr. Ekel's blurry, weirdly depopulated night scenes are all about memory and loss.
 ''Fendry Ekel -- The Witness,'' Hudson Valley Center for Contemporary Art, 1701 Main Street, Peekskill, through Jan 31. Information: (914) 788-0100 or hvcca.org.

HEADLINE: Underwater, but Will They Leave the Pool?

BYLINE: By RICHARD H. THALER. 
Richard H. Thaler is a professor of economics and behavioral science at the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago.

 BODY:
MUCH has been said about the high rate of home foreclosures, but the most interesting question may be this: Why is the mortgage default rate so low?
 After all, millions of American homeowners are ''underwater,'' meaning that they owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth. In Nevada, nearly two-thirds of homeowners are in this category. Yet most of them are dutifully continuing to pay their mortgages, despite substantial financial incentives for walking away from them. 
 A family that financed the entire purchase of a $600,000 home in 2006 could now find itself still owing most of that mortgage, even though the home is now worth only $300,000. The family could rent a similar home for much less than its monthly mortgage payment, saving thousands of dollars a year and hundreds of thousands over a decade. 
 Some homeowners may keep paying because they think it's immoral to default. This view has been reinforced by government officials like former Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr., who while in office said that anyone who walked away from a mortgage would be ''simply a speculator -- and one who is not honoring his obligation.'' (The irony of a former investment banker denouncing speculation seems to have been lost on him.)
 But does this really come down to a question of morality? 
 A provocative paper by Brent White, a law professor at the University of Arizona, makes the case that borrowers are actually suffering from a ''norm asymmetry.'' In other words, they think they are obligated to repay their loans even if it is not in their financial interest to do so, while their lenders are free to do whatever maximizes profits. It's as if borrowers are playing in a poker game in which they are the only ones who think bluffing is unethical. 
 That norm might have been appropriate when the lender was the local banker. More commonly these days, however, the loan was initiated by an aggressive mortgage broker who maximized his fees at the expense of the borrower's costs, while the debt was packaged and sold to investors who bought mortgage-backed securities in the hope of earning high returns, using models that predicted possible default rates. 
 The morality argument is especially weak in a state like California or Arizona, where mortgages are so-called nonrecourse loans. That means the mortgage is secured by the home itself; in a default, the lender has no claim on a borrower's other possessions. Nonrecourse mortgages may be viewed as financial transactions in which the borrower has the explicit option of giving the lender the keys to the house and walking away. Under these circumstances, deciding whether to default might be no more controversial than deciding whether to claim insurance after your house burns down.
 In fact, borrowers in nonrecourse states pay extra for the right to default without recourse. In a report prepared for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Susan Woodward, an economist, estimated that home buyers in such states paid an extra $800 in closing costs for each $100,000 they borrowed. These fees are not made explicit to the borrower, but if they were, more people might be willing to default, figuring that they had paid for the right to do so.
 Morality aside, there are other factors deterring ''strategic defaults,'' whether in recourse or nonrecourse states. These include the economic and emotional costs of giving up one's home and moving, the perceived social stigma of defaulting, and a serious hit to a borrower's credit rating. Still, if they added up these costs, many households might find them to be far less than the cost of paying off an underwater mortgage. 
 An important implication is that we could be facing another wave of foreclosures, spurred less by spells of unemployment and more by strategic thinking. Research shows that bankruptcies and foreclosures are ''contagious.'' People are less likely to think it's immoral to walk away from their home if they know others who have done so. And if enough people do it, the stigma begins to erode.
 A spurt of strategic defaults in a neighborhood might also reduce some other psychic costs. For example, defaulting is more attractive if I can rent a nearby house that is much like mine (whose owner has also defaulted) without taking my children away from their friends and their school. 
 So far, lenders have been reluctant to renegotiate mortgages, and government programs to stimulate renegotiation have not gained much traction. 
 Eric Posner, a law professor, and Luigi Zingales, an economist, both from the University of Chicago, have made an interesting suggestion: Any homeowner whose mortgage is underwater and who lives in a ZIP code where home prices have fallen at least 20 percent should be eligible for a loan modification. The bank would be required to reduce the mortgage by the average price reduction of homes in the neighborhood. In return, it would get 50 percent of the average gain in neighborhood prices -- if there is one -- when the house is eventually sold.
 Because their homes would no longer be underwater, many people would no longer have a reason to default. And they would be motivated to maintain their homes because, if they later sold for more than the average price increase, they would keep all the extra profit. 
 Banks are unlikely to endorse this if they think people will keep paying off their mortgages. But if a new wave of foreclosures begins, the banks, too, would be better off under this plan. Rather than getting only the house's foreclosure value, they would also get part of the eventual upside when the owner voluntarily sold the house.
 This plan, which would require Congressional action, would not cost the government anything. It may not be perfect, but something like it may be necessary to head off a tsunami of strategic defaults.

HEADLINE: Are Bargain Hunters Replacing the Bears at Scottsdale?

BYLINE: By ROB SASS

DATELINE: SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. 

 BODY:
 In January, when the triple-digit heat of summer is on vacation, central Arizona is left with surprisingly decent professional hockey, the winter lettuce harvest and bearable daytime high temperatures. But for those who are bigger fans of classic cars than of hockey or salad bars, it means only one thing -- the feeding frenzy caused by a week of five major collector car auctions.
 By now, even the most bearish and pessimistic pundits in the collector car world have stopped predicting a free fall in values, seemingly replaced by those speculating on when the market will return to its high of late 2007. The general consensus is that if that happens, it won't be until the economy is once again as fit as Lance Armstrong. No matter, buyers have been out in force at the auctions, which began last Tuesday, despite high winds and torrential rains that are highly unusual here. 
 By the time the last gavel comes down on Monday evening, well over $100 million in collector cars will probably have changed hands at five very different sales. 
 The oldest of the auctions here, Barrett-Jackson, started the sellathon last week in its usual overwhelming style -- its sales tent is seemingly larger than several Sam's Clubs and a Costco put together, with 1,200 cars offered and 39 hours of coverage on Speed TV. The cars on the block this year are less ethereal and less expensive than in recent years, but certainly more in keeping with today's economic reality. 
 Two high-end sales will undoubtedly vie for the highest average sale prices of the weekend: RM Auctions, which has the fanciest setting by far, at the historic Arizona Biltmore, and Gooding & Company, which camps out at an upscale shopping mall not far away. As their auctions last August in Pebble Beach, Calif., illustrated, the very top of the collector car market seems the least affected by the sluggish economy.
 This year, RM is holding a special Thursday night sale of nothing but British cars. 
 Russo & Steele's Scottsdale sale occupies the middle ground of the collector car market -- roughly $100,000 to $500,000 -- offering mainly American muscle cars and European sports cars. That part of the market seemed to be under the most stress last year. ''For those looking to buy genuine collectible cars, as opposed to novelties, the current market offers some real opportunity'' said Drew Alcazar, the founder and owner of Russo & Steele.
 But the Russo & Steele auction, which began on Thursday, was interrupted that night by one of the most severe storms the area has experienced in years. Winds tore at two of the tents the company was using to house cars going to auction, collapsing one of them and sending parts of the other blowing onto the nearby 101 Freeway.
 Several hundred vintage cars suffered at least minor damage, and no sales were made on Friday as fire officials kept the area cordoned off, saying it remained dangerous. Mr. Alcazar said Friday afternoon that he hoped to gain access on Saturday and to resume the company's auction on Sunday.
 Offering perhaps the most diverse and affordable group of cars is Silver Auctions, whose four-day sale takes place at a casino in Fort McDowell, Ariz., some 40 minutes away. Silver's sale is really the only place where a collector on a budget can hope to drive home in something interesting for under $10,000. 
 Of some 2,500 cars on the block in Arizona, here are five of special note.

GRAPHIC: PHOTOS: 1967 SHELBY COBRA 427: (RM Auctions) During the last run-up of collector- car values, big-block Shelby Cobras seemed on the cusp of joining the million- dollar club. Perhaps another day. Big, powerful and tough -- like this one's previous owner, Otis Chandler, the onetime Los Angeles Times publisher -- the auction company estimated that it would bring $650,000-$770,000. (PHOTOGRAPH BY SIMON CLAY/RM AUCTIONS)
1956 JAGUAR D-TYPE: (Gooding & Company) Long before Jaguar shifted its focus from sporting machines to soft luxury cars, it raced with considerable success -- and the D-Type, a repeat winner at Le Mans, was the ultimate racing Jaguar. Real D-Types with a racing history rarely come to market, and when they do collectors take notice. Gooding declined to publish a presale estimate. (PHOTOGRAPH BY PAWEL LITWINSKI/GOODING & COMPANY)
1960 FERRARI 250 GT SERIES II PININFARINA CABRIOLET: (Russo & Steele) Bidders seeking a deal in Arizona will notice this car's superficial similarity to long-wheelbase Ferrari California Spyders worth more than $1 million. But the ''PF Cab'' is a lovely car in its own right, and the presale estimate of $350,000- $400,000 seemed to be in the ballpark in today's market. (PHOTOGRAPH BY RUSSO & STEELE)
1962 PORSCHE 356 CARRERA 2 COUPE: (Gooding & Company) Vintage Porsches were little affected by the recent downturn in the collector car market. And ultrarare four-cam 356 Carreras -- powerful, complex and extremely expensive to maintain -- are blue-chip investments in any market. The presale estimate on this one was $200,000- $250,000. (PHOTOGRAPH BY PAWEL LITWINSKI/GOODING & COMPANY)
 1967 CHEVROLET CORVETTE 427/435 CONVERTIBLE: (Barrett-Jackson) Some collectors scorn big-block Corvettes as cases of overkill -- though often not those with the means to buy one. Prices are down considerably from the market peak, but it still takes at least $150,000 to buy a car that passes muster with the many opinionated Corvette experts who seem to be at every car show.

PERSON: Hasib Sabbagh 

HEADLINE: Hasib Sabbagh, 90, Co-Founder of a Big Middle East Builder

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Hasib Sabbagh, a founder of the Consolidated Contractors Company International, one of the largest construction companies in the Middle East, died on Jan. 12 in Cleveland. He was 90.
 His death was announced by the company. 
 Established in 1952 by Mr. Sabbagh and his brother-in-law, Said Khoury, Consolidated Contractors thrived in some of the world's most volatile regions, helped by Mr. Sabbagh's contacts with a wide range of business executives and politicians. 
 The company built the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, which was completed in 1969, a decade before Saddam Hussein became president. It also built a terminal extension at Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington.
 Hasib Sabbagh (pronounced SAB-ah) was born in 1920 in Tiberias, Palestine. He graduated from the Arab College of Jerusalem in 1938, and in 1941 earned a civil engineering degree from the American University of Beirut.
 His company moved its headquarters to Athens from Beirut after civil war broke out in Lebanon in 1975. It then benefited from the economic construction boom in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and provided offshore services to the oil and gas industries in the Persian Gulf.
 The magazine Arabian Business listed Mr. Sabbagh as one of the 50 most powerful people in the Arab world and ranked him 19th on its 2009 list of the richest Arabs, with a net worth of $4.3 billion.
 Mr. Sabbagh was also a member of the Palestine National Council and a donor to the Carter Center, founded in 1982 by former President Jimmy Carter, which promotes respect for human rights and fights global poverty. Mr. Carter said in 2005 that Mr. Sabbagh was ''one of my earliest and strongest allies in pursuing peace in the Middle East.''

HEADLINE: White House Is Confident Of Bernanke Confirmation

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
After a full-scale mobilization, White House officials expressed confidence on Saturday that they had contained a populist uprising among Democratic senators that had threatened President Obama's nomination of Ben S. Bernanke to a second term as the Federal Reserve chairman.
 Hoping to quell fears in the financial markets that Mr. Bernanke could become a casualty of rising anti-Wall Street sentiment, Senator Christopher J. Dodd, the Democrat from Connecticut who is chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, and Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, a Republican who is a member of the panel, said in a statement that ''based on our discussions with our colleagues, we are very confident that Chairman Bernanke will win confirmation.'' 
 Also on Saturday, Mr. Obama endorsed a bill scheduled for a Senate vote on Tuesday that would create a bipartisan budget commission and require that its recommendations for slashing deficits would get a vote in Congress this year. But he remained ready to establish a panel by executive order if the vote falls short, despite his support.
 The effort to secure Mr. Bernanke's confirmation, which had intensified after two Democratic senators announced their opposition on Friday, continued through Saturday and included calls to senators by both Mr. Obama and Mr. Bernanke. By late afternoon, senators began issuing statements of support.
 White House and Congressional Democratic leaders say they now believe that they have the 60 votes needed to block a filibuster of Mr. Bernanke's reappointment. They expect some Democrats will oppose him on the confirmation vote, but that requires only 50 votes. 
 The first break in what had seemed a potential stampede against Mr. Bernanke was the statement from Mr. Dodd and Mr. Gregg. About four hours later, two Democrats -- Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts and Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois -- issued separate endorsements.
 Mr. Kerry, acknowledging many Americans' anger about the bailouts of the big banks, said, ''It's understandable why there is debate, questioning and even anger'' about Mr. Bernanke's renomination. 
 ''Still,'' he added, ''out of this near calamity, I believe Chairman Bernanke provided leadership that was urgent, nimble, strong and vital in staving off greater disaster.''
 Mr. Obama's endorsement of the deficit commission bill sponsored by the leading Democrat and Republican on the Senate Budget Committee is intended to help ease passage on Tuesday of a separate and always unpopular measure to raise the nation's debt limit so the government can continue borrowing to cover its operations. In exchange for their votes to raise the debt limit, moderate Democrats have demanded a vote on the commission bill, as a sign that the White House and Congress are serious about reducing annual deficits.
 But by signaling bipartisanship and fiscal conservatism at a time when the public is demanding both, Mr. Obama is also likely to put Congressional Republicans on the defensive for opposing any budget commission.
 Most Republicans object that a commission would inevitably lead to tax increases. But economists generally agree that projected deficits cannot be brought under control without both tax increases and lower spending for Medicare and Medicaid.
 Mr. Gregg, the senior Republican on the budget committee who sponsored the commission bill with Senator Kent Conrad, the panel's Democratic chairman, said in an interview that both taxes and spending must be on the table.
 Mr. Obama had held back from endorsing a law for a commission partly because opponents included the speaker of the House, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California. His fallback proposal was a presidential commission, which would not require Congress to vote on its recommendations as a law would. For that reason, Mr. Gregg opposed it.
 Congressional Democratic aides said they still expected the commission bill to fail. If it does, the White House hopes that Mr. Gregg and other Republicans will reconsider their opposition to a presidential commission. 
 ''I'm not closing the door to that,'' Mr. Gregg said.

HEADLINE: The Great Unalignment

BYLINE: By MATT BAI. 
Matt Bai writes about national politics for the magazine.

 BODY:
This time last winter, Democratic Washington was crackling with confident talk of a progressive re-awakening in the land and an enduring Congressional majority. ''Realignment'' was the word of the moment, as in the kind of demographic and ideological shift that shaped the nation's politics for some 60 years after the election of Franklin Roosevelt. Now Democrats are trying to figure out how they lost what was presumed to be the safest Senate seat in the country -- it belonged to Ted Kennedy for 46 years -- and how to avoid hemorrhaging others. A year after George W. Bush's chopper swung away from the Capitol and disappeared from sight, voters seem to have put his presidency behind them; they're no longer willing to blame Republicans alone for high unemployment and rising gas prices, for home foreclosures and tuition hikes. The crises that Bush bequeathed to Democrats have now officially become theirs, and the notion of a great liberal realignment seems as retro as Friendster. 
A string of Democratic lawmakers, largely from rural and contested states, the kind of places that were supposed to now be more hospitable to Democrats than they were before, recently decided to pursue other careers rather than risk being turned out by wrathful voters. Party leaders who had once hoped to expand their majorities in November are now showing signs of panic as they scramble to stave off the prospect of crippling losses.
 Having stormed the Democratic garrison in Massachusetts, Republicans might find this turn of events amusing -- if it weren't for the fact that it has nothing to do with even a hint of a resurgence on their part. The entire story line seems awfully familiar. It was only five years ago that Karl Rove, praised in Washington as a clairvoyant, was predicting his own conservative realignment, premised on a near-biblical exodus from the Democratic Party: a decisive number of black, Latino and elderly voters, persuaded by Bush's re-forms of Social Security and immigration, were going to abandon the Democrats and enable Republicans to rule Washington for decades to come. That hallelujah chorus lasted for the few months it took for a Republican-dominated Congress to scrap Bush's second-term agenda, leading to one of the more astonishing political collapses in history. Historians of the last century will note that one party -- the Democrats -- solidly controlled Congress, with only passing interruptions, for more than six decades, through recessions and wars and other challenges. The Gingrich-Bush-era Republicans, by contrast, managed to hold onto power for only 12 years; should Democrats lose their majorities in 2012 or even 2014, let alone this year, they will have ruled Washington for even less time than that.
 The lesson here for strategists in both parties isn't simply that making self-aggrandizing predictions is a sure way to make yourself look silly (though that wouldn't be a bad one to take away, either). It's more that this entire concept of Rooseveltian realignment is a wishful conceit that should be retired. The realigning swing of the pendulum is almost certainly a relic of another age, never to be replicated, or at least not in our lifetimes. One reason is that politics in the television (and now Internet) age are less transactional and more ideological than they were in the long period between the Civil War and civil rights. The old question of what a party can do for you, through patronage or populist economics, has largely been eclipsed by the question of whether a party shares your convictions -- about the role of government, the use of force, abortion and stem cells. It's probably harder to build an enduring majority based on, say, gun rights than it was to do so by doling out local jobs.
 Even more consequential, though, is the fast-growing swath of voters who can summon no affinity for either party. As in other aspects of modern American life, brand allegiance in politics is at an all-time low; more than a third of Americans (and more than half of all Massachusetts voters) identify themselves as independents rather than as members of the blue team or the red. The most prevalent ideology of the era seems to be not liberalism nor conservatism so much as anti-incumbency, a reflexive distrust of whoever has power and a constant rallying cry for systemic reform. 
 And so the fundamental mistake that Republican and Democratic strategists each made after their respective takeovers was to believe that their victories represented an ideological shift among independent voters, the kind of sweeping philosophical reassessment -- Hey, you know what? We really do need a big centralized government! -- that would empower a party for generations to come. In fact, far from swinging wildly between conservatism and liberalism, a critical mass of dissatisfied Americans cast the exact same vote in 2006 as they did in 1994 -- a vote against entrenched power in the Capitol. The only real difference between those two elections lay in which party happened to be holding the gavel at the moment of revolt. 
 On a deeper level, the fading dream of realignment also reflects our attitudes about permanence in a society that judges its digital TVs by their ''refresh rates'' -- that is, the number of times per second that the pixels on the screen rearrange themselves to create a more eye-popping picture than the one that just existed. In an accelerated culture, our loyalties toward just about everything -- laundry detergents, celebrities, even churches and spouses -- transfer more readily than our grandparents could have imagined. Now we dispose of phone carriers and cash-back credit cards from one month to the next, forever in search of some better deal. Forget the staying power of an institution like Johnny Carson; when Jay Leno starts to feels a little stale, he is shifted to prime time, then shifted back to late night. It was probably never very realistic for modern political thinkers of either party to dream of a 50-year reign. This century's tectonic realignment is more likely to last 50 months or maybe 50 weeks, depending on how long it takes voters to seek out the latest offer or the newest best deal. 
 It isn't only majority parties that will have to recalibrate their ideas of longevity in this new environment. It's the individual politicians, too. Only in Washington, where changing social attitudes from the rest of the country generally arrive with all the speed of a Pilgrim vessel, is protracted incumbency still considered some kind of ace-in-the-hole selling point. Americans who rotate through a series of jobs or even careers every decade are far less likely to want to pull the lever for the same graying senator -- or the same graying party -- for the duration of their natural lives, which means the politician-as-local-institution is probably headed for the history books. It doesn't seem likely that Scott Brown, the newest Massachusetts senator, or any of the energetic and unwrinkled senators who have recently arrived in Washington will ever be memorialized the way Ted Kennedy was, or have the chance to treat the Senate as a kind of surrogate nursing home, in the manner of a Strom Thurmond or a Robert Byrd. 
 Politics refreshes itself more frenetically now. If politicians and their parties are going to realign anything in a society that's always shopping for the next thing, it will probably have to be their expectations.

HEADLINE: In New Hampshire, An Angry Tide Swells

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

DATELINE: MILFORD, N.H. 

 BODY:
George Brown, 50, the owner of Arthur's barber shop on the Oval in this picturesque New England town, said he ''breathed a sigh of relief'' when Scott Brown was elected to the Senate last week in neighboring Massachusetts.
 To Mr. Brown, who is not related to the new senator, the election meant the welcome death of the Democratic health care legislation in Washington. 
 ''If this health care bill had gone into effect, we would all be paying 75 percent of our paychecks in taxes,'' Mr. Brown said, sitting in the barber chair and listening to Fox News on the radio.
 ''It was all about the government taking over,'' said Mr. Brown, a Republican who voted for Senator John McCain for president in 2008.
 The anger that boiled over in Massachusetts last week is bubbling up here. It is rooted in a combination of factors, including fear over the proposed health care legislation, anxiety about the flailing economy and distrust of an overreaching government.
 In interviews last week around the snow-covered Oval, shop owners and their customers said their chief concern about health care was the cost. Many also said they did not like the idea of people being forced to buy health insurance or small employers being forced to provide it.
 ''Everybody is up in arms about this,'' Stephanie Tannariello, 28 and a staunch Republican, said after buckling her 19-month-old daughter into a sport utility vehicle parked just off the Oval.
 New Hampshire, of course, is usually the first state to vote in the presidential primaries and, its contrariness notwithstanding, candidates often look to voters here for early signs about how to frame their campaigns.
 Milford, a traditional stop on the presidential parade route, often votes Republican, but like much of New Hampshire, it is dominated by independents (25 percent of Milford voters are Democrats, 32 percent Republicans and 43 percent undeclared). In 2008, both the town and the state voted for Barack Obama.
 These days, New Hampshire is better off than many states. Its unemployment rate of 7 percent is below the national average of 10 percent. And only 10 percent of the state's residents are without health insurance, compared with 15 percent nationwide.
 Still, many here echoed the anxieties that roiled Massachusetts voters, who expected that a vote for Mr. Brown would, among other things, kill the Democratic health care bills in Washington.
 Tammy Landry, 50, the manager of the Fish Bowl pet supply store here, is an independent who voted for Mr. Obama. She has health insurance through her husband's employer, but she said she was afraid that Washington would change her coverage for the worse and increase the premiums.
 ''Massachusetts was about a lot of disgruntled people trying to show they're upset with the way things are,'' Ms. Landry said, standing in the glow of a bank of gurgling fish tanks. ''I've heard people use the word 'revolution,' and I do feel that way.''
 If there were a revolution, Irving Cable, 55, the lone customer at the nearby River House Cafe just before lunchtime, said he would march on the front lines. He loathes everything about the health care bills, he said, especially the requirement that everyone buy health insurance.
 ''I won't pay it!'' he declared. ''And I'll shoot the first person that tries to make me go to jail because I will not buy health insurance.''
 Charles Burke, 55, the manager of the cafe, which his wife has owned for 38 years, also rejected the idea of forced insurance coverage. He said he paid out of pocket for his trips to the doctor.
 Mr. Burke also said he could not afford to provide insurance for his six part-time employees. ''It's never been like this,'' he said, gesturing to the empty tables. ''The only value of this business right now is in the scrap metal value of the equipment.''
 Rachel Cedras, 18, a waitress at the cafe, said she was saving her tips for college, not health insurance. Ms. Cedras said she had been put off by watching politicians piece together the legislation.
 ''If you have to bribe people to vote for it,'' she said, ''it can't be good.''
 Around the Oval at the Pasta Loft, Tara Evans, 25, the manager, said she had been worried about the health proposals because if they passed, ''I would be out of a job because of the taxes'' the restaurant would have to pay to cover its 35 employees. She said she did not have coverage herself because it would cost $200 a month. ''That's a car payment,'' she said. ''Rent. Student loans.''
 Few seemed aware that the proposed bills would provide tax breaks for small-business owners or exempt them from penalties if they did not provide insurance to their employees. Or they assumed that they would still come out losers. 
 And many admitted to being thoroughly confused.
 ''I just don't know what the heck it is,'' said Marie Mack, 69, the owner of the Fish Bowl. Ms. Mack said she was not necessarily against a health care bill, but that Democrats had done a bad job of selling the idea.
 ''They have to simplify it for the simple folk,'' she said. 
 One of the few to mention the Democrats' goal of universal coverage was J. M. Princewell, who owns an eponymously named shop that specializes in handbags and jewelry.
 Ms. Princewell is a Democrat who supported Mr. Obama but sympathizes with the voters in Massachusetts. ''They already have universal coverage,'' she said, ''so they were in jeopardy of paying twice'' to cover everyone else.
 Nonetheless, she said, the government has to find a way to make health care affordable for everyone. Otherwise there could be an uprising with ''grotesque consequences,'' she said.
 ''I'm a middle-class person, but something is going to happen,'' she said. ''I can't help but look around and be concerned about the people who need help. And more and more, it's the middle class.''

HEADLINE: Bankers' Sense of Entitlement

 BODY:
We suspect most Americans would be baffled to realize that bankers see themselves as victims of the Obama administration's financial policies. But there you go.
 Irate at the administration's decision to impose a fee on the largest banks, the bank lobby has hired a top lawyer to challenge the levy all the way up to the Supreme Court. Their case seems to rest on the perplexing argument that the fee would amount to a bill of attainder, which singles out a specific group of people and violates their right to due process. But the levy is aimed at a class -- very large financial institutions. There are other taxes, fines and fees that operate in the same sort of way. 
 The push-back against the fee underscores bankers' peculiar sense of entitlement. They feel entitled to the public support dished out by the Treasury, the F.D.I.C. and the Federal Reserve. Yet they do not believe they should be made to contribute toward the effort to save the economy from their reckless behavior.
 President Obama articulated the fee as a way to recover the $117 billion cost of the direct financial bailout. It would apply to financial institutions with more than $50 billion in assets. (Bank of America, the country's largest bank, would have to pay about $1.5 billion a year.) 
 Mr. Obama could have gone further. Government assistance to the banks went far beyond the Treasury's bailout -- large guarantees from the F.D.I.C., copious lending from the Federal Reserve, extremely low interest rates. And the damage caused by the banks exceeded $117 billion by an order of magnitude.
 A levy on big banks' assets could also be seen as a way to slow the further consolidation of a banking system that already has too many banks considered too big to fail. It fits the administration's avowed interest in limiting the size of commercial banks by tightening limits on their market shares. In any case, having spent trillions to drag the economy back from the brink of the abyss, the government needs the money.
 And the money is there. Goldman Sachs said last week that it would set aside 35.8 percent of last year's revenue to pay bonuses. That is down from the 48 percent Goldman doled out for bonuses in 2008. But it adds up to an obscene $16.2 billion, more than 10 times what the proposed levy is expected to cost the bank each year.
 Bankers would do well to stop trying to avoid this fee, and they should stop trying to block broad-based reforms intended to create a more solid financial system.

HEADLINE: The Case for a Climate Bill

 BODY:
The conventional wisdom is that the chances of Congress passing a bill that puts both a cap and a price on greenhouse gases are somewhere between terrible and nil. President Obama can start to prove the conventional wisdom wrong by making a full-throated case for a climate bill in his State of the Union speech this week. 
 Washington has been forecasting the likely death of a climate bill with renewed certainty since Massachusetts elected a Republican senator who promised to block pretty much anything Mr. Obama wants. But even before then we were hearing two reasons why a bill could not pass: The Senate won't have any strength left when it finishes with health care, and the nation cannot afford a bill that implies an increase in energy prices.
 The first reason is defeatist, the second greatly exaggerated. The climate change bills pending in the Senate would not begin to bite for several years, when the recession should be over. The cost to households, according to the Congressional Budget Office, would be small. A good program would create more jobs than it cost. 
 The list of reasons to pass a climate bill, on the other hand, is long and persuasive. 
 Start with timing. The long-term trend in greenhouse gas emissions is up (the decade ending in 2009 was the warmest on record), and the sooner emissions decline, the better. The bill passed by the House last year calls for emissions in 2020 to be 17 percent lower than they were in 2005. This is the bare minimum required to give the industrialized world a fighting chance of achieving an 80 percent reduction by midcentury, which most mainstream scientists think will be necessary to avert the worst consequences of global warming.
 Then there is the race for markets. China is moving aggressively to create jobs in the clean-energy industry. Beijing not only plans to generate 15 percent of its energy from renewable sources by 2020, but hopes to become the world's leading exporter of clean energy technologies. Five years ago, it had no presence at all in the wind manufacturing industry; today it has 70 manufacturers. It is rapidly becoming a world leader in solar power, with one-third of the world's manufacturing capacity.
 Finally there's the question of credibility: Mr. Obama said in Copenhagen that the United States would meet at least the House's 17 percent target. Success in the Senate is essential to delivering on that pledge. Failure would undo many of the good things he achieved in Copenhagen, and it would give reluctant powers like China an excuse to duck their pledges.
 The jobs argument should impress the Senate. Yet many Democrats as well as Republicans seem willing to settle for what would be the third energy bill in five years -- loans for nuclear power, mandates for renewable energy, new standards for energy efficiency. These are all useful steps. But the only sure way to unlock the investments required to transform the way the country produces and delivers energy is to put a price on carbon. 
 Some senators understand that. John Kerry, Joseph Lieberman and Lindsey Graham are trying to forge a bill with a price on emissions as its core and enough other bells and whistles to attract the necessary filibuster-proof 60 votes. They will need help. Mr. Obama is the best person to provide it.

HEADLINE: After the Massachusetts Massacre

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
It was not a referendum on Barack Obama, who in every poll remains one of the most popular politicians in America. It was not a rejection of universal health care, which Massachusetts mandated (with Scott Brown's State Senate vote) in 2006. It was not a harbinger of a resurgent G.O.P., whose numbers remain in the toilet. Brown had the good sense not to identify himself as a Republican in either his campaign advertising or his victory speech.
 And yet Tuesday's special election was a dire omen for this White House. If the administration sticks to this trajectory, all bets are off for the political future of a president who rode into office blessed with more high hopes, good will and serious promise than any in modern memory. It's time for him to stop deluding himself. Yes, last week's political obituaries were ludicrously premature. Obama's 50-ish percent first-anniversary approval rating matches not just Carter's but Reagan's. (Bushes 41 and 43 both skyrocketed in Year One.) Still, minor adjustments can't right what's wrong. 
 Obama's plight has been unchanged for months. Neither in action nor in message is he in front of the anger roiling a country where high unemployment remains unchecked and spiraling foreclosures are demolishing the bedrock American dream of home ownership. The president is no longer seen as a savior but as a captive of the interests who ginned up the mess and still profit, hugely, from it. 
 That's no place for any politician of any party or ideology to be. There's a reason why the otherwise antithetical Leno and Conan camps are united in their derision of NBC's titans. A TV network has become a handy proxy for every mismanaged, greedy, disloyal and unaccountable corporation in our dysfunctional economy. It's a business culture where the rich and well-connected get richer while the employees, shareholders and customers get the shaft. And the conviction that the game is fixed is nonpartisan. If the tea party right and populist left agree on anything, it's that big bailed-out banks have and will get away with murder while we pay the bill on credit cards -- with ever-rising fees. 
 Politically, no other issue counts. In last weekend's Washington Post/ABC News poll, 42 percent of Americans chose the economy as the country's most pressing concern. Only 5 percent picked terrorism, and 2 percent Afghanistan. Obama's highest approval ratings are now on foreign policy and national security issues -- despite the relentless hammering from the Cheney right -- but voters don't care.
 Does health care matter? Not as much as you'd think after this yearlong crusade. In the Post/ABC poll, the issue was second-tier -- at 24 percent. Obama has blundered, not by positioning himself too far to the left but by landing nowhere -- frittering away his political capital by being too vague, too slow and too deferential to Congress. The smartest thing said as the Massachusetts returns came in Tuesday night was by Howard Fineman on MSNBC: ''Obama took all his winnings and turned them over to Max Baucus.'' 
 Worse, the master communicator in the White House has still not delivered a coherent message on his signature policy. He not only refused to signal his health care imperatives early on but even now he, like Congressional Democrats, has failed to explain clearly why and how reform relates to economic recovery -- or, for that matter, what he wants the final bill to contain. Sure, a president needs political wiggle room as legislative sausage is made, but Scott Brown could and did drive his truck through the wide, wobbly parameters set by Obama.
 Ask yourself this: All these months later, do you yet know what the health care plan means for your family's bottom line, your taxes, your insurance? It's this nebulousness, magnified by endless Senate versus House squabbling, that has allowed reform to be caricatured by its foes as an impenetrable Rube Goldberg monstrosity, a parody of deficit-ridden big government. Since most voters are understandably confused about what the bills contain, the opponents have been able to attribute any evil they want to Obamacare, from death panels to the death of Medicare, without fear of contradiction.
 It's too late to rewrite that history, but it may not be too late for White House decisiveness. Whatever happens now -- good, bad or ugly -- must happen fast. Each day Washington spends dickering over health care is another day lost while the election-year economy, stupid, remains intractable for Americans who are suffering.
 On the economic front, Obama needs both stylistic and substantive makeovers. He has stepped up the populist rhetoric lately -- and markedly after political disaster struck last week -- but few find this serene Harvard-trained lawyer credible when slinging populist rhetoric at ''fat-cat'' bankers. His two principal economic policy makers are useless, if not counterproductive, surrogates. Timothy Geithner, the Treasury secretary, was probably fatally compromised from the moment his tax lapses surfaced; now he is stalked by the pileup of unanswered questions about the still-not-transparent machinations at the New York Fed when he was knee-deep in the A.I.G. bailout. Lawrence Summers, the top administration economic guru, is a symbol of the Clinton-era deregulatory orgy that helped fuel the bubble.
 The White House clearly knows this duo is a political albatross. After the news broke that 85,000 more jobs had been lost in December despite some economists' more optimistic predictions, Christina Romer, a more user-friendly (though still academic) economic hand, was dispatched to the Sundayshows. This is at best a makeshift solution.
 Obama needs more independent economists like Paul Volcker, who was hastily retrieved from exile last week after the Massachusetts massacre prompted the White House to tardily embrace his strictures on big banks. Obama also needs economic spokesmen who are not economists and who can authentically speak to life on the ground. Obama must also reconnect. The former community organizer whose credit card was denied at the Hertz counter during the 2000 Democratic convention now spends too much time at the White House presiding over boardroom-table meetings and stiff initiative rollouts instead of engaging with Americans not dressed in business suits.
 When it comes to economic substance, small symbolic gestures (the proposed new bank ''fee'') won't cut it. Nor will ineffectual presidential sound bites railing against Wall Street bonuses beyond the federal government's purview. There's no chance of a second stimulus. The White House will have to jawbone banks on foreclosures, credit card racketeering and the loosening of credit to small businesses. This means taking on bankers who were among the Obama campaign's biggest backers and whose lobbyists have castrated regulatory reform by buying off congressmen of both parties. It means pressing for all constitutional remedies that might counter last week's 5-to-4 Supreme Court decision allowing corporate campaign contributions to buy off even more. 
 It's become so easy to pin financial elitism on Democrats that the morning after Brown's victory the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee had the gall to accuse them of being the ''one party who bailed out the automakers and insurance companies.'' Never mind that the Bush White House gave us the bank (and A.I.G.) bailouts, or that the G.O.P. is even more in hock than Democrats to corporate patrons. The Obama administration is so overstocked with Goldman Sachs-Robert Rubin alumni and so tainted by its back-room health care deals with pharmaceutical and insurance companies that conservativepoliticians, Brown included, can masquerade shamelessly as the populist alternative.
 Last year the president pointedly studied J.F.K.'s decision-making process on Vietnam while seeking the way forward in Afghanistan. In the end, he didn't emulate his predecessor and escalated the war. We'll see how that turns out. Meanwhile, Obama might look at another pivotal moment in the Kennedy presidency -- and this time heed the example.
 The incident unfolded in April 1962 -- some 15 months into the new president's term -- when J.F.K. was infuriated by the U.S. Steel chairman's decision to break a White House-brokered labor-management contract agreement and raise the price of steel (but not wages). Kennedy was no radical. He hailed from the American elite -- like Obama, a product of Harvard, but, unlike Obama, the patrician scion of a wealthy family. And yet he, like that other Harvard patrician, F.D.R., had no hang-ups about battling his own class. 
 Kennedy didn't settle for the generic populist rhetoric of Obama's latest threats to ''fight'' unspecified bankers some indeterminate day. He instead took the strong action of dressing down U.S. Steel by name. As Richard Reeves writes in his book ''President Kennedy,'' reporters were left ''literally gasping.'' The young president called out big steel for threatening ''economic recovery and stability'' while Americans risked their lives in Southeast Asia. J.F.K. threatened to sic his brother's Justice Department on corporate records and then held firm as his opponents likened his flex of muscle to the power grabs of Hitler and Mussolini. (Sound familiar?) U.S. Steel capitulated in two days. The Times soon reported on its front page that Kennedy was at ''a high point in popular support.'' 
 Can anyone picture Obama exerting such take-no-prisoners leadership to challenge those who threaten our own economic recovery and stability at a time of deep recession and war? That we can't is a powerful indicator of why what happened in Massachusetts will not stay in Massachusetts if this White House fails to reboot.

HEADLINE: With Japan, U.S. May Be Losing Some Diplomatic Ground to China

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
When Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates visited Japan's new leaders in October, not long after their historic election, he pressed so hard and so publicly for a military base agreement that the Japanese news media labeled him a bully. 
 The difference between that visit and the friendly welcome that a high-level Japanese delegation received just two months later in China, Japan's historic rival, could not have been more stark. 
 A grinning President Hu Jintao of China took individual photos with more than a hundred visiting Japanese lawmakers, patiently shaking hands with each of them in an impressive display of mass diplomacy. 
 The trip, organized by the powerful secretary general of Japan's governing Democratic Party, Ichiro Ozawa, was just one sign of a noticeable warming of Japan's once icy ties with China. It was also an indication that the United States, Japan's closest ally, may be losing at least some ground in a diplomatic tug-of-war with Beijing. 
 Political experts say Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama's greater willingness to engage Beijing and the rest of Asia reflects a broad rethinking of Japan's role in the region at a time when the United States is showing unmistakable signs of decline. It also reflects a growing awareness here that Japan's economic future is increasingly tied to China, which has already surpassed the United States as its largest trading partner.
 ''Hatoyama wants to use Asia to offset what he sees as the declining influence of the United States,'' said Yoshihide Soeya, director of the Institute of East Asia Studies at Keio University in Tokyo. ''He thinks he can play China off the United States.''
 Mr. Soeya and other analysts say warmer ties with China are not necessarily a bad thing for Washington, which has long worried about Japan's isolation in the region. But some are concerned that the new openness toward China may also be driven by a simmering resentment within Mr. Hatoyama's left-leaning government of what some here call the United States' ''occupation mentality.'' Those feelings have been stoked by what many Japanese see as the Obama administration's high-handed treatment in the dispute over the air base on Okinawa.
 The White House is pressing Japan to follow through on a controversial deal to keep a base on the island that was agreed to by the more conservative Liberal Democrats who lost control to Mr. Hatoyama's party last summer after decades of almost uninterrupted power. 
 ''If we're worrying that the Japanese are substituting the Chinese for the Americans, then the worse thing you could do is to behave the way that we're behaving,'' said Daniel Sneider, a researcher on Asian security issues at Stanford University.
 The new emphasis on China comes as Mr. Hatoyama's government begins a sweeping housecleaning of Japan's postwar order after his party's election victory, including challenging the entrenched bureaucracy's control of diplomatic as well as economic policy.
 On security matters, the Liberal Democrats clearly tilted toward Washington. Past governments not only embraced Japan's half-century military alliance with the United States, but also warned of China's burgeoning power and regularly angered Beijing by trying to whitewash the sordid episodes of Japan's 1930s-1940s military expansion.
 American experts say the Obama administration has been slow to realize the extent of the change in Japan's thinking about its traditional protector and its traditional rival. 
 Indeed, political experts and former diplomats say China has appeared more adept at handling Japan's new leaders than the Obama administration has been. And former diplomats here warn that Beijing's leaders are seizing on the momentous political changes in Tokyo as a chance to improve ties with Japan -- and possibly drive a wedge between the United States and Japan. 
 ''This has been a golden opportunity for China,'' said Kunihiko Miyake, a former high-ranking Japanese diplomat who was stationed in Beijing. ''The Chinese are showing a friendlier face than Washington to counterbalance U.S. influence, if not separate Japan from the U.S.'' 
 Some conservative Japan experts in Washington have even warned of a more independent Tokyo becoming reluctant to support the United States in a future confrontation with China over such issues as Taiwan, or even to continue hosting the some 50,000 American military personnel now based in Japan.
 Despite such hand-wringing among Japan experts in the United States, Mr. Hatoyama continues to emphasize that the alliance with Washington remains the cornerstone of Japanese security. And suspicions about China run deep here, as does resentment over Japan's losing its supremacy in Asia, making a significant shift in loyalty or foreign policy unlikely anytime soon, analysts say. 
 But in the four months since Mr. Hatoyama took office, there has been an unusual flurry of visits back and forth by top-ranking Chinese and Japanese officials, including one last month to Tokyo by China's heir apparent, Vice President Xi Jinping. 
 The new mood of reconciliation is also evident in the novel ideas that have been floated recently to overcome the differences over wartime history that have long isolated Japan from the region. 
 These include a recent report in the Yomiuri Shimbun, a Japanese newspaper, based on unidentified diplomatic sources, of a Chinese initiative for reconciliation that would include a visit by Mr. Hatoyama to Nanjing to apologize for the 1937 massacre of Chinese civilians there by invading Japanese soldiers. President Hu would then visit Hiroshima to proclaim China's peaceful intentions. 
 While both countries dismissed the report as speculation, it spurred wide talk here that the report might be a trial balloon by one of the two countries that could signal a new willingness to make some sort of diplomatic breakthrough on the history issues. 
 And a week after the visit to Beijing by Mr. Ozawa and his parliamentary delegation, which Mr. Hu heralded as the start of a smoother era in Japan-China relations, Tokyo reciprocated with its own display of eager hospitality during a visit to Tokyo by Mr. Xi, the Chinese vice president. Mr. Hatoyama arranged a meeting between Mr. Xi and Emperor Akihito at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo on short notice, breaking protocol that such audiences be arranged more than a month in advance.
 Mr. Ozawa, a shadowy kingmaker whose power rivals Mr. Hatoyama's, is said to have warm feelings for China, where he has often visited, and he is widely seen as the force behind Japan's latest overtures to Beijing.
 Other members of Mr. Hatoyama's cabinet remain less convinced that any drift away from the United States is a good idea. 
 One of the skeptics is Defense Minister Toshimi Kitazawa, who has stressed the need for the American military presence to offset China and a nuclear-armed North Korea. Last month, Mr. Kitazawa brought in Yukio Okamoto, a widely respected former diplomat and adviser to Liberal Democratic prime ministers, to advise Mr. Hatoyama on security issues.
 ''The Democrats have to realize the threat we have on the Korean Peninsula, and that China is not a friendly country in military matters,'' Mr. Okamoto said.
 Mr. Soeya, of Keio University, warned that the new Japanese government should at least think hard before sidling closer to China, saying, ''Mr. Hatoyama does not have a clear sense of what relying on China would really mean, or whether it is even actually desirable.''

HEADLINE: 2010: The Year of the Renter?

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY

 BODY:
SCORES of stalled construction projects can be found scattered around New York City, but one category of building that doesn't seem to have been sidetracked by the recession is the luxury apartment rental.
 At least 16 new rental buildings are expected to open in Manhattan in coming months, ranging from small buildings to 500-unit high-rises, for a total of more than 3,500 apartments. Brooklyn will get an additional 3,500 new apartments as well, including units in some buildings that opened in late 2009.
 While 7,000 new apartments is a relatively small number for a city where 70 percent of 8 million residents live in rentals, many of the new buildings are concentrated in just three neighborhoods: Manhattan's Hudson Yards area, downtown Brooklyn and Williamsburg.
 These apartments are becoming available at a time when average rents are down by about 25 percent from the market's height in early 2008; vacancy is close to 2 percent, compared with just under 1 percent in 2007 and 2006; and the city is still losing jobs. As a result, the new buildings are offering a range of incentives to lure tenants, including one to five months of free rent, free gym memberships, American Express gift cards and even free iPods. 
 The new buildings, with all their enticements, will most likely set off another round of apartment musical chairs -- first seen in 2009 -- in which many renters with leases coming up will try to move to fancier buildings or better deals.
 Rents have already dropped to the levels they reached in 2000, and the influx of apartments is expected to keep them there. New studios in the Hudson Yards area could start at $2,000.
 ''The opening of new buildings is really going to be the keynote of 2010,'' said David J. Wine, a vice chairman at the Related Companies, which owns and manages about 5,000 rental units in New York City, but does not have a building opening this year. He said that Manhattan had not had to absorb this many new market-rate apartments in more than a decade.
 But after the surge of new buildings in 2010, Mr. Wine and other rental developers said, rental construction in the city will hit a lull. ''After these buildings are completed, there's going to be nothing, because banks stopped financing,'' he said, referring to the credit crunch that started in late 2008 and has hit developers and home buyers equally hard.
 ''Nothing''may be a slight exaggeration, since Related hopes to open a new building on 10th Avenue and 42nd Street in 2011 and has eventual plans to build some 5,000 units directly over the Hudson Yards.
 But Robert Scaglion, the managing director of residential marketing for Rose Associates, thinks the ''nothing'' assessment is about right. ''This is going to be the end of all the rental developments that were planned three to five years ago,'' he said. ''And after this group hits the market, there's not going to be much else.''
 Rose is managing two Williamsburg buildings that are to open soon -- 184 Kent, a 338-unit converted warehouse, and 34 Berry, a 140-unit building.
 As developers work to fill their new buildings in 2010, Frederick S. Harris, a senior vice president for development at AvalonBay Communities, said that ''you almost by definition have to have a pause.''
 Avalon just opened Avalon Fort Greene, a 630-unit unit building that is actually in downtown Brooklyn.
 ''We will be delivering Avalon Fort Greene through most of this year because it's such a large building,'' Mr. Harris said. ''And this will be our last delivery for a while.''
 Avalon has plans for another rental tower in West Chelsea but is not likely to break ground there until next year.
 Although new buildings will open throughout the city in the coming months, the largest concentration will be in neighborhoods that developers had pegged as the latest frontiers.
 In the Hudson Yards area, which is bounded by 30th Street, 42nd Street, Eighth Avenue and the Hudson River, four large projects have started or will soon start leasing apartments: Silver Towers, two 60-story glass towers with nearly 1,000 market-rate apartments built by Silverstein Properties; Emerald Green, a 569-unit project developed by Glenwood Management; Ohm, a 288-unit building from Douglaston Development; and 505 West 37th Street, two towers with 835 units developed by TF Cornerstone.
 The number of new apartments expected for downtown Brooklyn in 2010 is no less extensive: the 650 units at Avalon Fort Greene; 365 units at 80 Dekalb, a 36-story tower built by Forest City Ratner; 512 units at Brooklyn Gold, a project of Lalezarian Developers; and 491 units at the Brooklyner, a 51-story tower from the Clarett Group.
 Developers and brokers say that rental activity has been strong at buildings that opened in late 2009. But some community leaders are skeptical.
 Andrew Berman, a member of the Hudson Yards Community Advisory Committee, said, ''The market is simply not there for them, and the only way they're filling apartments is by doing things that they never intended to do, just to get tenants.''
 The neighborhood, Mr. Berman said, is ''not equipped to handle this flood of product.'' He pointed to ''insane traffic, lack of public schools and lack of an affordable, full-service supermarket.''
 Mr. Harris of Avalon said that while it would have been much easier to fill buildings in a stronger economy, he did not see the surge of new units in downtown Brooklyn as a problem.
 ''Having four buildings come on line at the same time can be a good thing when you're in an emerging neighborhood,'' he said. ''People won't think: 'Why is this guy here? Did he make a big mistake?' ''
 Instead, he said, there's ''a sense that the neighborhood is really changing.''
 The new buildings have amenities meant to appeal to 20- and 30-somethings -- swimming pools, expansive gyms, screening rooms, large roof decks, game rooms with pool tables or arcade games. For incentives, landlords are paying brokers' fees and offering one or two months' free rent on 14-month leases, and as much as five free months on two-year leases.
 Developers generally have already reduced their original projected monthly rents by a minimum of 10 percent. But the sales pitch often revolves around ''net effective rent,'' which takes free rent into account to bring the number down further. That could mean net rent for a studio starting at $2,000 in the Hudson Yards area and about $1,400 in downtown Brooklyn. The average rent for Manhattan studios in the last quarter of 2009 was $2,253, according to Prudential Douglas Elliman.
 ''Everybody is competitive in terms of giving incentives,'' said Clifford Finn, the managing director of new development marketing for Citi Habitats, ''but with everybody giving about the same, it puts you back in an apples-to-apples comparison, so it comes back down to location and the actual product.''
 As for free iPods, offered to people who signed leases at 60 Monitor Street, a 60-unit building in Williamsburg, they were attention-grabbers pure and simple. ''Differentiating yourself is half the battle,'' said David Maundrell, the president of aptsandlofts.com, which has the listing. Other incentives included a month of free rent and no broker's fee.
 ''Once you get them in the door, they still come prepared to negotiate,'' Mr. Maundrell said. ''If there's one or two months free, people are asking for $50 off on top of that, and in a rollout, we try to look at every deal and we'll consider it.''
 The carefully baited hooks are apparently working. The northern tower of Emerald Green offered one to two months' free rent and was 80 percent rented in the three months between Labor Day and Christmas, a traditionally slow time of year. The same offer at the much larger Silver Towers resulted in the leasing of about 400 apartments, or 40 percent, since it opened last May.
 The promotions at new buildings will undoubtedly also help keep prices down elsewhere in the city. Marc Lewis, the president of Century 21 NY Metro, estimated that rents had dropped to 2000-era levels. He said they were not likely to climb anytime soon.
 ''Landlords don't want to publicize it,'' he said. ''But if something is listed at $2,100, a tenant will offer $1,900 and maybe they'll settle on $2,000, with possibly a free month thrown in, plus the landlord pays the commission.''
 Still, Chris Albanese, a principal of the Albanese Organization, which has rental towers in Chelsea and Battery Park City, said he didn't think the new inventory would directly compete with his buildings.
 ''Are some people coming in and saying, 'I can get two months' free rent and the rent is only $2,200 over there'? Of course,'' he said. ''But we're not going to drop from $3,200 to $2,200. You can't walk into a Honda dealership and walk out with a Mercedes. And most people know there's a difference between a prime neighborhood and a secondary one.''
 Mr. Finn of Citi Habitats says the people attracted to the new developments include renters trading up from no-doorman buildings or walk-ups in the city. But he also says the new tenants are New Jersey or Queens residents who previously felt priced out of Manhattan. He said that the percentage of renters coming from outside Manhattan had increased to 30 percent from 20 percent in the last year.
 But until new jobs are created to bring in a new pool of renters, it will continue to be a renter's market, said Marisa DiNatale, a director at Moody's Economy.com. ''You won't see pricing power for landlords return until there's a strong recovery of the economy,'' she said.
 By most accounts, New York's employment outlook is better than initial predictions, but recession-generated job loss is still not expected to stop until mid-2010. The New York City Independent Budget Office has scaled back the anticipated job loss to 157,200, from 254,500, and predicts employment will start growing again this summer.
 ''But some sectors, such as finance, we don't think are going to turn positive again until 2012,'' said Douglas Turetsky, the budget office's chief of staff. ''So even though we're going to start seeing new jobs in sectors like leisure and hospitality, what those jobs pay may not quite match the rent levels for the new buildings that are coming on line.''
 Brokers and analysts have long predicted that many of the stalled construction projects around the city are condo buildings that will eventually be converted to rental buildings. But so far, few buildings have taken this step.
 Mr. Scaglion of Rose said that 184 Kent was intended to be a condominium, but that the developer, JMH Development, decided to make it a rental during construction when it became clear that condos in the area were not selling well.
 Still, Mr. Scaglion said, condo buildings for the most part are not easily turned into rentals because they have ''high-end finishes that don't wear well with rental tenants, and there's usually no back of house, no shop or staff to fix and renovate apartments.''
 Nor do most condo developers want to become rental owners; they would rather renegotiate their construction loans so that they can cut prices and sell out their projects.
 Stephen Kotler, a director of rentals for Prudential Douglas Elliman, said that many developers of stalled projects had avoided foreclosure only because they had been able to keep current on their construction loans by spending ''interest reserves'' negotiated as part of their initial loan packages. ''But a lot of those reserves are going to start running out midyear,'' he said. ''And that's when you're going to see more condo projects becoming rentals.''
 Some investors are betting that the wind will continue to blow in a renterly direction. A venture called Condominium Recovery was recently formed to buy distressed condo projects and rent them out for a minimum of three to four years before selling them as rental buildings.
 Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel and a partner in Condominium Recovery, says that the plan is to introduce about 2,500 new rental units to market starting in 2011. That is just a fraction of the city's estimated 22,000 ''shadow'' condo units: unfinished apartments in stalled buildings, or completed units not yet listed for sale.
 But if other companies also convert condos into rentals, Mr. Miller said, the new inventory could ''continue to press rental prices down.'' Even so, he said, ''the three- to four-year outlook for New York City rentals for developers is still probably more favorable than the outlook for luxury condos.''
 Move-In Day Is Not Carved in Stone
 CONSTRUCTION delays are part and parcel of any new development, so it should come as no surprise that if you're signing a lease in a brand-new rental building, a firm move-in date can be elusive.
 Developers sometimes lease apartments before they have received final permits from the city. So if a building is still under construction, potential renters should ask whether the unit they hope to move into has a certificate of occupancy. If it doesn't, they should be prepared for delays.
 At Brooklyn Gold, some renters were told that they could move in on Dec. 1, 2009, but that date has moved several times; the first move-in is now scheduled for Feb. 1. And at Avalon Fort Greene, move-in dates for about a dozen people were delayed by about a week late last year. Both buildings have compensated renters who were inconvenienced.
 Frederick S. Harris, a senior vice president for development at AvalonBay Communities, says that apartments are leased about a month in advance of the anticipated receipt of building department approval.
 ''We had to push back the first group of people because the certificate of occupancy was later than predicted,'' Mr. Harris said. ''We try very hard to time it right, but when you're leasing in advance, sometimes you get it wrong.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: January 31, 2010

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about new rental units coming online this year in New York City misstated the role Rose Associates has with two buildings in Brooklyn, 184 Kent Street and 34 Berry Street. It is marketing the buildings, not managing them. The article also misstated the title Robert Scaglion holds at the company. He is the senior managing director of residential marketing, not the managing director.

HEADLINE: Resetting The Moral Compass

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
IT was great to see President Obama renew his focus on financial reform last week, even if it looked like an attempt to distract voters from his party's stunning loss of the Senate election in Massachusetts. Even so, by promoting the ideas of Paul Volcker -- the esteemed former Federal Reserve chairman -- the White House is finally elevating the discourse on how best to rein in risky behavior at banks and protect beleaguered taxpayers from future bailouts of Wall Street. 
 Those discussions are especially important, given that Congressional efforts to overhaul the financial system have thus far done little to ensure that we will never again have to fork over hundreds of billions of dollars to rescue bankers from their own bad bets. ''Too big to fail'' turned out to be ''too hard to tackle'' for lawmakers. 
 So the proposals from Mr. Volcker, a man whom the White House has marginalized in the strangest of ways until now, are a step in the right direction. That's because they aim to keep highflying traders and other gamblers inside of banks from getting their hands on or putting at risk the old-fashioned savings of average depositors. 
 A main element to the plan would bar banks from making proprietary trades -- using their own money to place directional market bets that are unrelated to serving customers. Another change would prevent institutions from investing their own money in hedge funds or private equity operations.
 ''I think something will actually come of this proposal because, unlike health care and the environment, this is an issue that resonates on both sides of the aisle,'' said Richard Sylla, economic and financial historian at the Stern School of Business at New York University. ''The message you are sending is a good one -- that maybe we let the bankers do too much of what they wanted to do and some of it came back to haunt us. So now we are going to lay some restrictions on them going forward.'' 
 The proposal has its weaknesses. In the pantheon of risk-taking at banks, it is hard to argue that proprietary trading involves substantially greater peril than that inherent in commercial lending. Just ask the banks that are sitting, nervously, on huge loans backed by commercial real estate that were made during the mania. 
 And some may wonder why the proposal's spotlight is so trained on proprietary trading and hedge fund operations, since these were not where banks experienced their greatest losses in the crisis. The biggest money pits were a result of securities underwriting, especially in the mortgage arena. When the mortgage spree ground to a halt, firms like Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch were stuck with toxic securities they had underwritten but had been unable to persuade customers to buy.
 Moreover, the entire financial system over the last two decades became linked in a potentially viral network of derivatives contracts that won't go away simply because traders decamp to a different neighborhood than depositors. 
 Still, singling out proprietary trading, hedge funds and private equity units does make sense for a couple of reasons. First, the proposal moves us closer to resolving pieces of the ''moral hazard'' issue, that uncomfortable state of affairs that occurs when companies don't worry about bet-the-ranch risks because they know that someone (usually the taxpayer) is waiting in the wings to save them if they blow it (as they so often do).
 So reducing the number of ways in which banks can engage in morally hazardous activities is a positive move. 
 THERE is another morality problem that the Volcker plan would address: insider trading. Proprietary trading, hedge funds and private equity units are three lines of business where Wall Street firms can profit mightily on inside information and data gleaned from their customer relationships elsewhere in the company. 
 As financial firms have become more vertically integrated in the past 10 years, adding to their stable of businesses, the potential for profiting on nonpublic information has increased exponentially. Meaningful information can emerge from a client's securities holdings, from pending transactions the client wants to make or from a firm's knowledge of the customer's financial standing. 
 Of course, banks maintain that they have built impenetrable walls in their organizations to prevent seepage of material information. But suspicions remain about the effectiveness of these barriers, and with good reason. 
 Even if the so-called Volcker Rule takes effect, it won't do much to eliminate the fact that regulators and legislators will continue to see large financial institutions as too big or too interconnected to fail. Even if Goldman Sachs gave up its bank holding company status to escape new restrictions on proprietary trading, does anybody think the government wouldn't bail it out if it gambled so poorly that it landed on the precipice? 
 And even if the new rules are put in place, it will be hard for regulators to differentiate between transactions that a bank makes for its clients from those made in its own account. In addition, you can be sure that armies of Wall Street lawyers are even now studying ways to circumvent such rules if they are enacted. 
 More troubling, said Christopher Whalen, editor of the Institutional Risk Analyst, is that the Volcker Rule would do nothing to solve the most disturbing problem to have emerged in the crisis: how Wall Street created flotillas of toxic securities and sold them to investors. 
 ''We are tilting at stereotypes of what we think is the problem,'' Mr. Whalen said. ''But the bottom line is, we have prostituted our standards of securities underwriting and sales of securities to investors. When the Street starts justifying stuffing customers and saying, 'It's O.K., caveat emptor,' that requires a public policy response. We need to say to the Street, 'In all the things you do, especially if it is sold to a pension fund, you have a duty of care to every party in the transaction.'''
 This seems quaint indeed, given the prevailing view on Wall Street that if a sophisticated investor buys a pool of poisonous mortgage loans, the seller has no obligation to keep the ''big boys'' from harm. But bringing a sense of duty back into the sale of securities to customers, regardless of their sophistication, is a worthy goal. And it is one that Wall Street should welcome if it hopes to regain investor confidence anytime soon.

 BODY:
The most striking feature of Barack Obama's campaign for the presidency was the amazing, young, Internet-enabled, grass-roots movement he mobilized to get elected. The most striking feature of Obama's presidency a year later is how thoroughly that movement has disappeared.
 In part, it disappeared because the Obama team let it disappear, as Obama moved to pass what was necessary -- the economic stimulus -- and what he aspired to -- health care -- by exclusively playing inside baseball with Congress. The president seems to have thought that his majorities in the Senate and the House were so big that he never really had to mobilize ''the people'' to drive his agenda. Obama turned all his supporters into spectators of The Harry and Nancy Show. And, at the same time, that grass-roots movement went dormant on its own, apparently thinking that just getting the first African-American elected as president was the moon shot of this generation, and nothing more was necessary. 
 Well, here's my free advice to Obama, post-Massachusetts. If you think that the right response is to unleash a populist backlash against bankers, you're wrong. Please, please re-regulate the banks in a smart way. But remember: in the long run, Americans don't rally to angry politicians. They do not bring out the best in us. We rally to inspirational, hopeful ones. They bring out the best in us. And right now we need to be at our best. 
 Obama should launch his own moon shot. What the country needs most now is not more government stimulus, but more stimulation. We need to get millions of American kids, not just the geniuses, excited about innovation and entrepreneurship again. We need to make 2010 what Obama should have made 2009: the year of innovation, the year of making our pie bigger, the year of ''Start-Up America.''
 Obama should make the centerpiece of his presidency mobilizing a million new start-up companies that won't just give us temporary highway jobs, but lasting good jobs that keep America on the cutting edge. The best way to counter the Tea Party movement, which is all about stopping things, is with an Innovation Movement, which is all about starting things. Without inventing more new products and services that make people more productive, healthier or entertained -- that we can sell around the world -- we'll never be able to afford the health care our people need, let alone pay off our debts.
 Obama should bring together the country's leading innovators and ask them: ''What legislation, what tax incentives, do we need right now to replicate you all a million times over'' -- and make that his No. 1 priority. Inspiring, reviving and empowering Start-up America is his moon shot.
 And to reignite his youth movement, he should make sure every American kid knows about two programs that he has already endorsed: The first is National Lab Day. Introduced last November by a coalition of educators and science and engineering associations, Lab Day aims to inspire a wave of future innovators, by pairing veteran scientists and engineers with students in grades K-12 to inspire thousands of hands-on science projects around the country.
 Any teacher in America, explains the entrepreneur Jack Hidary, the chairman of N.L.D., can go to the Web site NationalLabDay.org and enter the science project he or she is interested in teaching, or get an idea for one. N.L.D. will match teachers with volunteer scientists and engineers in their areas for mentoring.
 ''As soon as you have a match, the scientists and the students communicate directly or via Skype and collaborate on a project,'' said Hidary. ''We have a class in Chicago asking for civil engineers to teach them how to build a bridge. In Idaho, a class is asking for a scientist to help them build a working river delta inside their classroom.''
 The president should also vow to bring the Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship, or NFTE, to every low-income neighborhood in America. NFTE works with middle- and high-school teachers to help them teach entrepreneurship. The centerpiece of its program is a national contest for start-ups with 24,000 kids participating. Each student has to invent a product or service, write up a business plan and then do it. NFTE (www.NFTE.com) works only in low-income areas, so many of these new entrepreneurs are minority kids.
 In November, a documentary movie -- ''Ten9Eight'' -- was released that tracked a dozen students all the way through to the finals of the NFTE competition. Obama should arrange for this movie to be shown in every classroom in America. It is the most inspirational, heartwarming film you will ever see. You can obtain details about it at www.ten9eight.com.
 This year's three finalists, said Amy Rosen, the chief executive of NFTE, ''were an immigrant's son who took a class from H&R Block and invented a company to do tax returns for high school students, a young woman who taught herself how to sew and designed custom-made dresses, and the winner was an African-American boy who manufactured socially meaningful T-shirts.''
 You want more good jobs, spawn more Steve Jobs. Obama should have focused on that from Day 1. He must focus on that for Year 2.

HEADLINE: OBAMA SUMMONS TEAM FROM 2008 FOR RACES IN FALL

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and PETER BAKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama is reconstituting the team that helped him win the White House to counter Republican challenges in the midterm elections and recalibrate after political setbacks that have narrowed his legislative ambitions. 
 Mr. Obama has asked his former campaign manager, David Plouffe, to oversee House, Senate and governor's races to stave off a hemorrhage of seats in the fall. The president ordered a review of the Democratic political operation -- from the White House to party committees -- after last week's Republican victory in the Massachusetts Senate race, aides said.
 In addition to Mr. Plouffe, who will primarily work from the Democratic National Committee in consultation with the White House, several top operatives from the Obama campaign will be dispatched across the country to advise major races as part of the president's attempt to take greater control over the midterm elections, aides said.
 ''We are turning the corner to a much more political season,'' said David Axelrod, a senior adviser, who confirmed Mr. Plouffe's role. ''We are going to evaluate what we need to do to get timely intelligence and early warnings so we don't face situations like we did in Massachusetts.'' 
 As Mr. Obama prepares to deliver his State of the Union address on Wednesday and lay out his initiatives for the second year of his presidency, his decision to take greater control of the party's politics signals a new approach. The White House is searching for ways to respond to panic among Democrats over the possible demise of his health care bill and a political landscape being reshaped by a wave of populism.
 Improving tactical operations addresses only part of his challenge. A more complicated discussion under way, advisers said, is how to sharpen the president's message and leadership style. 
 The reinforcement of the White House's political operation has been undertaken with a sense of urgency since Tuesday, when a Republican, Scott Brown, won the Massachusetts Senate seat that had been held by Edward M. Kennedy. The White House was caught off guard when it became clear that Democrats were in danger of losing it, and by the time alarm bells sounded from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, it was too late.
 The president summoned Mr. Plouffe to the Oval Office hours before the polls closed and asked him to assume the new role because of the implications the midterm elections hold. Mr. Plouffe built a reputation in 2008 as a master of the nuts and bolts of campaigns, and will assemble a team to provide unfiltered information that serves as an early-warning system so the White House and party officials know if a candidate is falling behind. 
 The day-to-day political operation will be run by Jim Messina, a deputy White House chief of staff, but Mr. Plouffe will coordinate the effort.
 The party is trying to become less reliant on polls conducted by candidates, which can often paint a too-rosy picture of the political outlook. The president's leading pollster, Joel Benenson, will be among those conducting research for Mr. Plouffe, aides said, along with others who will divide the country by regions. 
 Mr. Plouffe, who did not follow Mr. Obama to the White House last year, has remained in the president's tight circle of advisers and has frequently worked on projects for the party.
 The first indication of Mr. Plouffe's more prominent role came in an op-ed article he wrote for the Sunday issue of The Washington Post, presenting a blueprint for how Democrats could avoid big defeats in the fall. He acknowledged the challenges ahead, saying, ''We may not have perfect results, but November will be nothing like the nightmare that talking heads have forecast.'' 
 Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said he had ''no interest in sugarcoating'' the defeat in Massachusetts. Several party leaders said they expected Mr. Menendez to remain in his position for the rest of the election cycle, but the move by the White House had the effect of subverting at least some of the committee's authority.
 ''Our own political operation will be more rigorously in communication with the other elements, so we can compare notes,'' Mr. Axelrod said. ''What we learned from Massachusetts is that we need to be more assiduous about getting our own data and our own information so we have a better sense of where things stand.''
 The White House intends to send Mr. Obama out into the country considerably more in 2010 than during his first year in office, advisers said, to try to rekindle the relationship he developed with voters during his presidential campaign. 
 His first big chance will come when he delivers his State of the Union address. Rather than unveil a laundry list of new initiatives, advisers said, Mr. Obama will try to reframe his agenda and how he connects it with public concerns. In particular, he will focus on how his ideas for health care, energy and financial regulation all fit into the broader economic mission of creating what he calls a ''new foundation'' for the country, the key words being ''rescue, restore and rebuild.''
 While presidents typically experience rough patches, this one is particularly challenging for Mr. Obama. Liberals have grown disenchanted with what they see as his unwillingness to fight harder for their causes; independents have been turned off by his failure, in their view, to change the way Washington works; and Republicans have become implacably hostile.
 The long and messy legislative fight over health care is a leading example of how Mr. Obama has failed to connect with voters, advisers say, because he appeared to do whatever it would take to get a bill rather than explain how people could benefit.
 ''The process often overwhelmed the substance,'' said Dan Pfeiffer, the White House communications director. ''We need to find ways to try to rise above the maneuvering.''
 The discussion inside the White House includes at least two distinct debates: Should Mr. Obama assume a more populist or centrist theme in his message? And should the White House do what it takes to pass compromise legislation or should it force votes, which even if unsuccessful can be used to carry an argument against Republicans in the fall?
 It remains an open question how much new legislation will pass Congress, but the coming months will help frame the campaigns. While some form of financial regulation and job creation measures may pass, Obama aides said, larger initiatives like health care, a cap on carbon emissions and an immigration overhaul may have to wait, even though the White House denies trimming its ambitions.
 ''I wouldn't say the door is shut on trying to find some places where you can develop a strategy for a bipartisan vote in the Senate,'' said John D. Podesta, a former White House chief of staff under President Bill Clinton who advises the Obama team.
 But he said Republicans appeared determined to oppose any initiative Mr. Obama offers. ''They would try to deny him passing the Mother's Day resolution,'' he said.
 Some veterans of the Clinton White House have advised their friends in the West Wing to take a breath and not make lasting decisions in the immediate aftermath of the election, when it might be tempting to overreact.
 Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff and himself a Clinton alumnus, gave a pep talk at the senior staff meeting last week. ''These things go in cycles,'' participants recalled him saying. ''We've got a lot of work to do. Keep your head up and keep going.''

HEADLINE: Imagining a Stronger Haiti Past the Pain

BYLINE: By JAMES TRAUB

 BODY:
Until Jan. 12, Haiti was a ''fragile state'' desperate for help to develop a working economy and effective institutions. Now it is something much worse -- a charnel house with tens of thousands of corpses in a capital city laid waste. Relief has superseded development, and languid policy debate has given way to a vast and accelerating mobilization.
 Still, it may be only weeks before the bodies have been buried and much of the rubble cleared away. And then the question so urgently pressed in the weeks and months before the earthquake will return: What can the international community do to help Haiti create a future different from the generations of misery it has known? 
 Scholars, advocates and political leaders agree that to just set Haiti back on its feet and move on would restore it to a dismal status quo from which it plainly can not escape on its own. And the terrible misfortunes the Haitian people have endured have added to this logic a deep sense of moral obligation. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has promised that Haiti will ''come back even stronger and better'' than before.
 The question is: How? State-building or ''post-conflict reconstruction'' is much harder than disaster relief. Whether in Bosnia, Kosovo, Iraq or Afghanistan, nation-builders have been forced to recognize the difficulty of nurturing the institutions, norms and habits of functioning states. Haiti's own recent history offers chastening lessons to spare. Decades of despotic rule by the Duvalier family converted the state into an instrument of thievery and repression; such creatures do not disappear with their masters.
 Haitians and outsiders hoped that Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the populist priest elected president in 1990, would dismantle the Duvaliers' predatory state. When the army forced Mr. Aristide from power, President Bill Clinton, acting with the United Nations, ordered an invasion in 1994 to restore his rule. Western donors invested hundreds of millions of dollars in state-building. But Mr. Aristide and the new elite he promoted proved as contemptuous of popular welfare as their predecessors. In 1998, the World Bank reported that ''political instability, woefully poor governance and corruption'' had again frustrated hopes for reform. Six years later, the United States helped drive Mr. Aristide into exile.
 Some experts, including the economist Jeffrey Sachs, have insisted that such efforts failed because the United States and others did not care enough or spend enough. Mr. Sachs has now proposed a multibillion-dollar ''Haiti Fund'' to get it right. But the painful past experience is bound to condition the coming response. Afghanistan can be seen as a counter-model: Corruption on a vast scale has both undermined American efforts at state-building and provoked cynicism about the endeavor itself.
 But there are reasons to hope things may be different now. One is that natural catastrophes can create a sense of shared sacrifice and purpose that discredits aggressive self-seeking, if only temporarily. In Indonesia, for example, the state and local rebels reached a peace settlement in the aftermath of the 2004 tsunami.
 Such accommodations require a government concerned with the welfare of its people. And there is now widespread agreement that the government of President Rene Preval, elected in 2006, is the most honest Haiti has had in generations. Last year, it presented a two-year development plan that won broad acceptance; at a conference in April, donors pledged $350 million. Crime was falling before Jan. 12, and Haiti's police, once a source of terror, had become the nation's most trusted institution. Such progress, though modest, undermines arguments that Haiti's problems are so deeply rooted in its culture as to doom any state-building effort to failure -- a mirror image of the claim that the country bears no responsibility for its own plight.
 Relief is already shading into reconstruction: Port-au-Prince's wrecked port is being repaired, and donors will soon be paying to rebuild roads and power plants. James Dobbins, an official at the RAND Corporation who was President Clinton's special envoy to Haiti, says institutional reform must begin at the same time as physical reconstruction. He argues that in Haiti, as elsewhere, international donors have focused on building things rather than the institutions of state. ''Much of the money should be spent on the state,'' he says, through training and employing locals, rather than channeling funds through private contractors or nonprofit organizations. At the same time, he adds, donors must guard against corruption by setting up ''systems of accountability'' in exchange for loans and grants.
 State-building experts and those with long experience in Haiti generally agree that the state-building effort should not bear an American face. Haitians may not blink today at the sight of an American military helicopter landing in front of the National Palace, but the United States has been Haiti's bugbear since Woodrow Wilson sent in the Marines in 1915. (They stayed until 1934.) Mr. Dobbins suggests an enhanced role for the World Bank. Others say the United Nations should continue to lead the process.
 There are differences as well about what path Haitian economic development should take. In a report last year to the U.N., the development economist Paul Collier proposed a job-creation strategy centering on the export of garments. But manufacturing-led growth has failed in Haiti before. Robert Maguire, a Haiti expert with the United States Institute of Peace, notes that the destruction of Port-au-Prince has produced a mass exodus to the countryside; donors, he says, ''need to follow the Haitian people and find ways of supporting their exodus.'' (Post-earthquake, Mr. Collier proposes that aid money be used to help modernize agriculture as well as to promote urban employment.)
 On Jan. 11, Mr. Maguire wrote in a briefing paper that President Preval had improved ''the prospect for progress towards stability and growth,'' though ''Haiti's future remains tenuous.'' It is, of course, vastly more tenuous today; in addition to the physical wreckage, much of Haiti's governing and business class has been wiped out. The success of the state-building project will be largely determined by whether those flickering signs of progress can survive the nation's latest calamity.

HEADLINE: The Crescendo of the Rally Cry

BYLINE: By SAM TANENHAUS

 BODY:
Like so many good narratives, political stories often unfold along simple lines but invite multiple, at times conflicting, interpretations.
 And so it happened last week. First came the upset victory by Scott Brown, a Republican, in the special Senate election in Massachusetts, widely deemed a populist uprising and symbolized by the mile-weary pickup truck that became a feature of Mr. Brown's campaign.
 Only two days later, the Supreme Court, in a more sweeping ruling than many expected, undid the bipartisan campaign finance reform of 2002, freeing corporations, labor unions and other organizations to spend unlimited sums at election time.
 President Obama, taking up his own newfound populist theme, said the decision favored ''powerful interests'' that threaten to ''drown out the voices of every day Americans.'' 
 Republicans countered that Democrats also have their moneyed backers -- in Hollywood as well as in the drug companies that support Mr. Obama's imperiled health-care reform bill.
 Either way, the two surprises highlighted a widening divide in American politics, exemplified by the Tea Party brigades who helped engineer Mr. Brown's victory and also by liberals who have been voicing their disillusionment with the first year of the Obama presidency.
 The post-partisan consensus that seemed possible a year ago has given way to a curious harmony of dissent -- as both sides denounce government bailouts and Wall Street bonuses. But in fact, two different protests are under way. One, most visible on the left, is rooted in traditional populism that favors increased government. The other, on the right, springs from a purist strain in American politics that distrusts government altogether.
 During the Great Depression, populist sentiments were captured by figures like Dr. Francis Everett Townsend, who mounted a national campaign for old-age pensions; the idea helped shape the Social Security Act.
 The period's most gifted populist politician, Huey P. Long, spoke movingly of the ''criminal'' farm foreclosures he had seen as a boy in rural Louisiana, and advocated that all Americans received a ''homestead allowance'' and guaranteed annual income. Contrast this with the televised eruption by Rick Santelli, the CNBC reporter who is often said to have spawned the Tea Party movement early last year. In his widely replayed rant, Mr. Santelli vented his ire not at bailouts of Wall Street firms or the Detroit auto makers, but rather at Mr. Obama's plan to assist homeowners unable to pay their mortgages.
 ''This is America,'' Mr. Santelli said. ''How many of you people want to pay for your neighbor's mortgage that has an extra bathroom and can't pay their bills?''
 A parallel dislike of the elite animates both populism and purism. But the two find that elite in different places. Populists deplore the rich, for instance the corporate executives now reaping large bonuses. Purists dislike the governing class -- politicians who readily abandon core principles and strike deals with the other side.
 Thus, purist rebellions have repeatedly been directed at elites within the Republican Party -- whether the ''me-too'' centrists of the 1950s and 60s or the ''Republicans in Name Only'' under assault today.
 In times of disarray, Republican leaders have drawn on insurgents, who refresh the party's principles and supply it with grassroots energy. But the purists don't always reciprocate. Mr. Brown's election seemed to offer the prospect of a truce, since Tea Party activists and the National Republican Senatorial Committee had joined forces to secure his win.
 But the Massachusetts election could be a special case -- a battle whose timing may have upended President Obama's health care campaign by snatching away a seat the Democrats had held for nearly six decades. In places where conservatives are more entrenched -- in Florida and Colorado, for instance -- Tea Party insurgents and established Republicans remain at odds, quarreling over candidates and platforms.
 This conflict recalls the tensions that arose during the conservative movement's first truly successful insurgency -- the drive to nominate Barry Goldwater for president in 1964. Then, too, grassroots activists, including members of the John Birch Society -- a group as extreme in its day as the ''birthers'' are in 2010 -- declared war on the Republican establishment, ''a small group of secret kingmakers,'' as Phyllis Schlafly described them in her election-year manifesto ''A Choice Not an Echo.''
 Movement conservatives ''want to mass the nation's conservative strength in one party,'' the political scientist James MacGregor Burns observed of the Goldwater crusade. ''They do not really care which party, but at this point the G.O.P. seems the best vehicle for their hopes.''
 Goldwater lost the general election, but the insurgents gained control of the party, and their efforts at purification eventually succeeded when Goldwater's heir Ronald Reagan was elected in 1980. ''Me-too'' Republicans, many from the East Coast, either were marginalized or left the party altogether.
 The result was the more ideologically unified party still intact in 2010, most obviously in Congress, where House Republicans have formed a rigid bloc and Senate Republicans have made the threat of a filibuster their instrument of obstruction -- further honed, no doubt, by Scott Brown's victory on Tuesday.
 And yet, even though they have steadily opposed Mr. Obama, these same Republicans are now under assault. The new insurgents accuse them of complicity with the administration in big-spending, big-government ways.
 How did this happen? One explanation is that with so few moderates left, the only plausible targets for angry purists are conservatives tainted by the occasional heresy -- someone like Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who voted to confirm Justice Sonia Sotomayor, or Gov. Charlie Crist of Florida, who endorsed Mr. Obama's stimulus package.
 An added complication is that it is increasingly difficult to say precisely where private life ends and government begins. The two have become so deeply, and at times confusingly, interrelated that is now possible to be both for and against big government, sometimes at the same moment.
 A memorable example occurred last summer when Bob Inglis, a House Republican from South Carolina, drew the ire of insurgents at a town hall meeting. One voter angrily told him, ''Keep your government hands off my Medicare.'' Mr. Inglis replied, ''Actually, sir, your health care is being provided by the government.'' At the time, this incident was widely cited as a sign of public ignorance about health care. But it can be interpreted differently -- as a reflection of the helplessness many Americans feel at a time of growing dependency on a growing government: one that gives health-care coverage, and can take it away or reduce its benefits.
 The most conservative recent presidents, Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, both presided over expansions of the federal bureaucracy. Mr. Bush, in particular, angered many purists with spending programs like his massive prescription-drug bill.
 In such an environment, it is no surprise that neither party commands much loyalty. Populists are losing patience with Democrats even as purists wrangle with Republicans.
 Mr. Brown seems acutely aware of this. In his victory speech he credited the will of ''the independent majority.'' Whether such a majority exists is another question.
 Looking back at the Great Depression, Arthur Schlesinger Jr. wrote that even in that period of profound political and economic crisis, Americans held fast to ''the desperate inner conviction that somewhere an answer could be found.'' It is in that pursuit, perhaps, that populists and purists can find common ground.

HEADLINE: China Unveils Strategy For 'Stability' in Tibet

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
China's top leaders laid out a strategy last week for bringing ''leapfrog development and lasting stability'' to the Tibetan regions, the state news agency reported late Friday.
 President Hu Jintao and other leaders at a Tibet planning conference decided that ''more efforts must be made to greatly improve living standards of the people in Tibet, as well as ethnic unity and stability,'' the Xinhua news agency reported. 
 The emphasis on economic development indicates that Chinese leaders still see the solution to the problem of Tibet as one of supplying creature comforts. If the region can develop fast enough, the reasoning goes, then Tibetans will buy into Chinese rule. 
 But a vast uprising among Tibetans in 2008 and continuing tensions since have shown that even though the region's economy has been growing quickly for years, many Tibetans still feel economically disadvantaged and culturally threatened. In private conversations, Tibetans often express rage over the suppression of traditional Buddhist practice and over the influx of ethnic Han migrants to Tibetan areas. 
 Tibet remains a point of contention between China and the United States. Tensions are expected to deepen because President Obama has said he will meet with the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader, early this year.
 The Chinese government has invested $45.6 billion in Tibet since 2001, according to Xinhua. Tibet's gross domestic product, estimated to be $6.4 billion last year, has increased 170 percent since 2000, the agency said. Xinhua reported that the average income of Tibetan farmers and herders was expected to match the national level by 2020.
 Despite those numbers, ethnic nationalism remains a potent sentiment across almost all Tibetan areas of China. At the conference, which ran from Monday to Wednesday, senior leaders not only laid out policy for central Tibet, the area China designates as the Tibet Autonomous Region, but also drew up plans to develop ethnic Tibetan areas in the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, Gansu and Qinghai. 
 Tibetans in those eastern regions also took part in the 2008 protests. Until then, Chinese policies there had been more relaxed than those in central Tibet. But the meeting indicated that Chinese leaders could now be ready to make those regions follow the hard-line policies of the Tibet Autonomous Region.
 Indeed, parts of eastern Tibet have been governed with an iron grip since the uprising. Last spring, during the anniversary of a 1959 Tibetan rebellion, Chinese officials closed off huge areas to foreigners and flooded rebellious towns and villages with security forces, effectively putting those areas under martial law. Centers of protest in 2008, like the Labrang Monastery in Xiahe, were locked down for months.
 In March 2008, riots and protests broke out first in Lhasa, Tibet's capital, then throughout other Tibetan areas, as Tibetans turned on the Han, the dominant ethnic group in China. At least 19 people were killed in Lhasa, most of them Han, the Chinese government said; Tibetan rights groups said scores of Tibetans were killed by security forces and many more detained. The uprising was the largest ethnic rebellion in China in decades.
 China blamed the Dalai Lama, who lives in exile in India, for the uprising and accuses him of being a ''splittist.'' The Dalai Lama has denied involvement and has said he wants only true autonomy for Tibet, not independence. 
 At the meeting last week, Mr. Hu said, ''Tibet faces a special contradiction between people of all ethnic groups and the separatist forces led by the Dalai clique,'' according to Xinhua.
 A sign of the importance of the conference was the attendee list: besides Mr. Hu, it included Wen Jiabao, the prime minister; Xi Jinping, the vice president who is the favorite to succeed Mr. Hu; and Li Keqiang, Mr. Xi's main rival for the top leadership position in China.

HEADLINE: In a Kennedy Hometown, Warm Feelings Don't Necessarily Mean Votes

BYLINE: By A. G. SULZBERGER

DATELINE: HYANNIS, Mass. 

 BODY:
The residents of this cozy village on the southern shore of Cape Cod recollect with pride the sight of his unmistakable hefty, white-topped frame as they exchanged greetings on the street, waited together in line at the local ice cream shop, shared a church pew or returned his dogs -- those dogs! -- after they found their way into some neighboring yard. 
 And in one of those heartfelt compliments extended only to those of unusually good fortune, they consistently describe Senator Edward M. Kennedy, who died in August, as having been just a regular person. 
 ''He was a real guy,'' said James F. Munafo Jr., 49, a Republican who serves on the Barnstable Town Council. ''He was a star, but he was one of us. I think people are pleased and will always be pleased that he was part of our community.''
 But the high regard here and throughout the state was not enough to keep the seat that Mr. Kennedy held for 46 years, the seat that his brother John F. Kennedy held before him, in the hands of Democrats.
 As the owner of Hyannis Marina, Wayne Kurker, 55, developed a friendship with Mr. Kennedy, who was a devoted sailor. ''Although I'm not a liberal, I always felt like there was nobody that listened to his constituents more,'' Mr. Kurker said, explaining why as a moderate independent he had become such a strong backer of Mr. Kennedy. 
 In the special election held last Tuesday, though, Mr. Kurker eagerly cast his ballot for Scott Brown, a previously little-known Republican state senator, contributing to one of the biggest upsets in state history. ''I wish I could have voted more than once,'' Mr. Kurker said.
 The Town of Barnstable, made up of seven villages, the largest of which is Hyannis, voted 12,331 to 7,543 in favor of Mr. Brown. The precinct that encompassed the Kennedy family's Hyannis Port compound, and where Mr. Kennedy himself used to cast his vote, also rejected the Democrat, Martha Coakley, the state attorney general who had been considered a prohibitive favorite. 
 The outcome gives Republicans 41 votes in the Senate, just enough to potentially scuttle the health care legislation that Mr. Kennedy worked so vigorously to pass. And it has provoked conflicting emotions in the town that is home to gray-shingled summer residences, asphalt-lined stretches of strip malls and a year-round population of about 50,000.
 ''Even down here where he was admired and considered a friend, people, when they went to vote, were just thinking about their own fears and concerns,'' said Patrick Princi, 36, the chairman of the Barnstable Democratic Town Committee. 
 Most of those concerns have nothing to with the previous occupant of the seat.
 ''It wasn't about the Kennedy seat,'' said Deborah Converse, 63, president and chief executive of the Hyannis Area Chamber of Commerce, which oversees the John F. Kennedy Hyannis Museum. ''I think the Democrats wanted to make it that way, but it just wasn't,'' said Ms. Converse, who voted for Ms. Coakley. ''I didn't think of Kennedy at all, and I run this museum.''
 Local issues, like a controversial plan to allow a wind farm six miles off the coast -- which Mr. Brown and Mr. Kennedy opposed, but Ms. Coakley supported -- played a role, as did national issues like health care, taxes and the economy. 
 Even those who voted for Ms. Coakley said they found her campaign uninspired, and noted that her glad-handing skills paled in comparison with the famously gregarious Mr. Kennedy. Mr. Brown campaigned more aggressively in the area and was careful to praise Mr. Kennedy, calling him irreplaceable during his victory speech. 
 The results mirrored those of much of Cape Cod, in which 11 of the 15 towns backed the Republican. Registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans in Barnstable, but both are dwarfed by independent voters.
 ''I just think everyone is sick of the way everything's going,'' said Doug Brown, 39, who owns a small excavation company, is not related to Tuesday's winner and who used to regularly end up with Mr. Kennedy's runaway dogs in his yard. ''The Kennedy thing is done now.''
 The voters of Cape Cod pride themselves on being independent and have historically been more conservative than the rest of the state. Hyannis, where John F. Kennedy gave his victory speech after winning the presidency in 1960, and where a memorial and a museum to him now stand, voted against him that year. 
 And when Edward Kennedy first ran for the Senate in 1962, he lost here by more than two to one, according to the Barnstable town clerk, Linda E. Hutchenrider. Even in later years, as his reputation as a legislator who took care of voters back home grew large, he bested one opponent by fewer than 800 votes and only twice won 60 percent of the vote.
 For Democrats, the days since the election have been rife with second-guessing. Some lamented that other members of the Kennedy clan -- one of the late senator's sons and a nephew were mentioned as possible contenders, as was his widow, Victoria -- had not jumped into the race. 
 ''I would have loved to have had Victoria run, but she had to make her own decision,'' said Howard K. Penn, 78, co-owner of the Puritan Cape Cod clothing store, where generations of Kennedys have bought khaki pants and polo shirts. 
 Philip W. Johnston, a public relations consultant and friend of the Kennedys, said one member of the family, whom he declined to name, had told him that they were particularly pained by the loss of the filibuster-proof Democratic supermajority. ''The notion that health reform might die because Teddy died,'' he said, ''is very hard to deal with.''

 BODY:
FREEDOM FOR THE THOUGHT THAT WE HATE: A Biography of the First Amendment, by Anthony Lewis (Basic, $15.95.) ''Many of the great advances in the quality -- the decency -- of American society were initiated by judges,'' Lewis writes in this account of how they prohibited the government from banning offensive speech and created the modern First Amendment. In this ''passionate if discursive essay,'' as Jeffrey Rosen called it in the Book Review, Lewis discusses a range of issues from sedition and obscenity to hate speech and secret wiretapping. 
 CUTTING FOR STONE, by Abraham Verghese (Vintage, $15.95.) Twin brothers, conjoined and then separated, grow up amid the political turmoil of Ethiopia. Both go into medicine, like their adoptive parents and like their father -- who abandoned them after the tumultuous birth that killed their mother. This big, dense novel, the first by Verghese, a physician and accomplished writer, is full of vivid descriptions of surgery and of heartfelt affection for the characters. 
 EZRA POUND: POET. A Portrait of the Man and His Work. Volume I: The Young Genius, 1885-1920,by A. David Moody. (Oxford University, $19.95.) The early Pound -- editor and talent-spotter, connected to all the important little magazines in London in the teens -- comes alive in this installment of a projected two-volume biography. Moody ''knows more about Pound's poetry than probably anyone else alive,'' our reviewer, Charles McGrath, said, and he provides close readings of the first books. His theme is Pound's effort to find a suitable poetic subject and method that would transcend his academic interest in Provencal poetry and engage the world. Moody also gives us a man who was, as William Carlos Williams put it, both ''often brilliant'' and ''an ass.'' 
 JOKER ONE: A Marine Platoon's Story of Courage, Leadership, and Brotherhood, by Donovan Campbell (Random House, $16.) Campbell led a 40-man Marine platoon in Ramadi during the most violent days of the insurgency in 2004. In this remarkably detailed account of their experience, he doesn't delve into whether the Iraq war was justified or well-planned. But he describes a unit whose background, training and equipment (insufficient armor and translation services) left its members completely unprepared. 
 PASSING STRANGE: A Gilded Age Tale of Love and Deception Across the Color Line, by Martha A. Sandweiss (Penguin, $17.) Clarence King, a well-known 19th-century explorer, geologist and writer -- a blond blue blood from Newport -- passed as black for 13 years. His ''peculiarly American story,'' in Sandweiss's words, is the subject of this meticulously researched book. King met Ada Copeland, a former slave, in New York City and claimed to be a sleeping-car porter (therefore black) in order to marry her legally. King's white friends thought he was a man about town who lived in residence hotels when in New York (he was actually in Queens with Ada), and Ada believed his frequent absences were required by his job. King confessed his real identity to his wife before he died in 1901; she lived to 103, and was one of the few former slaves alive to hear King's ''I Have a Dream'' speech in 1963. 
 NOTHING TO FEAR: FDR's Inner Circle and the Hundred Days That Created Modern America, by Adam Cohen (Penguin, $16.) When Franklin Roosevelt took office in 1933, banks were closed in 38 states and unemployment was over 25 percent. In the first 100 days, the new president signed 14 major acts of legislation, remaking the banking and financial system and providing relief for farmers and the unemployed. Cohen, a member of the editorial board of The New York Times, tells the story vividly, illuminating policy discussions with portraits of some of the crucial aides through whom Roosevelt worked. 
 THE COLLECTOR OF WORLDS, by Iliya Troyanov. Translated by William Hobson (Ecco/Harper Collins, $13.99.) Sir Richard Francis Burton, a 19th-century British adventurer, linguist, archaeologist, poet, spy and mystic, moved easily among cultures and identities. He mastered Islamic ritual so completely that he was able to complete the pilgrimage to Mecca in 1853 undetected. Troyanov, a Bulgarian-born novelist who now lives in Vienna, ''has turned Burton's unbelievable life into believable fiction,'' our reviewer, Ben Macintyre, said. 
 HOW TO LIVE: A Search for Wisdom From Old People (While They Are Still on This Earth), by Henry Alford (Twelve, $13.99.) Alford set out to ''spend time with as many fascinating senior citizens as I can'' in his search for wisdom. He interviews informants over 70 years old -- including some famous ones, like Harold Bloom and Edward Albee -- and, while questioning his stepfather, precipitates a family crisis that ends his mother's marriage. 
 THE MANUAL OF DETECTION,by Jedediah Berry (Penguin, $15.) Berry's first novel manages to be both dreamlike and clever. A book of instructions is turned over to a newly minted novice detective hunting for a vanished colleague on the rainy streets of an unnamed city. As he re-examines the man's closed cases, his ''uncanny adventures make for a memorable trip,'' Marilyn Stasio said in the Book Review.

HEADLINE: Helped to Heal by a Stranger's Truth

BYLINE: By LEAH CARROLL. 
Leah Carroll lives in Brooklyn. She is writing a book about her parents.

 BODY:
I DRESSED as if preparing for a first date. I picked out a blue cotton sweater with an applique bird perched on the right shoulder. Pearl earrings, lip gloss, a touch of mascara. Jeans to balance out the makeup and the applique bird. I wanted to look as if I'd tried, but not too hard. 
 In the Hungarian Pastry Shop, waiting for him, I stirred milk into my coffee and balanced my spoon on the saucer. I picked up a book and then put it down, gazing across the street at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine. When he walked in, the sun was just beginning to set.
I felt a nervous flutter at finally seeing him, but my tension was not romantic. He wasn't a love interest but rather a journalist who had written years ago about my mother's murder, and about the men who murdered her. And about the economic decline and culture of despair in early-'80s Rhode Island that contributed to her dying as she did, at the hands of crazed drug dealers who suspected her of being a police informant instead of the mere addict she was. 
 In the journalist's articles, drawn in part from reams of disturbingly graphic grand jury testimony, he described how my mother's face turned purple as the two men twisted a towel around her neck, and how one of them, for leverage, put his foot against her face while saying: ''Come on, you rat. Give me the death rattle.'' 
 I was 4 when my mother died. My memory of her is fuzzy, though I can see glimpses of her: standing next to me on the city bus as we lurched through Providence; reading aloud to me from a picture book; in silhouette, smoking a cigarette by the front door of our tiny house in Cranston, R.I. 
 Over the following years, my father (who soon remarried, bringing me a new family) did not speak to me about my mother's death, except to lie that she died in a car accident. My questions to him and to my maternal grandparents about her ''accident'' prompted only whispers and tight smiles. They were happy to tell me of my mother's love of animals and the way her tiny frame seemed to fill a room with happiness. But the subject of her death led only to unease and silence. 
 It wasn't until I was 9 that the journalist's article revisiting her death as part of a larger article about murder, organized crime and corruption was spread across the pages of The Providence Journal, and my father thought he could no longer spare me from the truth.
 ''There is a story in the paper today,'' he said to me. ''And we have to talk about something very difficult.''
 ''You're going to tell me Mom was murdered, aren't you?'' 
 I'm not sure, even today, where the words came from -- how I knew.
 ''Yes,'' he said.
 I didn't see the article then, not necessarily out of fear of what I might learn but because the subject had been taboo for so long that I was scared I would get in trouble if I were caught reading it.
 Once I was in college, though, with access to the campus computer lab and the relatively new resource of the Internet, I realized I could probably find it online. Sure enough, after paying $6 for a week's worth of access to The Journal's archives, I found it. There on the screen was the article about my mother's death, spelled out in the starkest terms. It was horrifying. It was also liberating. 
 And now, 10 years later and some 200 miles away, here I was, shaking hands with the man who had written the article, offering to buy him coffee.
 He declined, saying he would get a cup for himself in a bit. Then he said, ''What would you like to talk about first?''
 As I always do when I'm nervous, I blurted out the worst thing. I said I wanted to know about the death rattle, and about the towel and about the motel room where my mother had died. I explained how his words had haunted my family and my childhood. I described reading them for the first time in that college computer lab and knowing that everything would be different from that point on. 
 ''Does any of that make sense?'' I asked, wishing I could reach back into that space and rearrange my words into something less desperate sounding. 
 But the journalist simply nodded. He said he had thought this day would perhaps come. And then, instead of explaining my story, my mother's story, he started with his own. He described how when he read those words -- ''Give me the death rattle'' -- in the grand jury testimony it felt as if he was encountering real evil for the first time. 
 ''But I was 29,'' he told me. ''I was knee-deep in cops and mobsters. And the story was all mine. And it was stunning.''
 In all the time I'd spent anticipating what he and I would talk about if we were ever able to meet, I never imagined he would say anything quite like that. It seemed to me a shocking display of honesty, as if he had shed all his clothes beneath a bright fluorescent light, every fold and imperfection on display, matching me ounce for ounce in vulnerability.
 I didn't know how to counter or to explain that what he had written so many years ago had jolted me into an understanding of what had happened to my mother that I would not have come to otherwise, and how important that understanding was to me.
 We talked more easily after that. I told him my father, too, had worked for The Providence Journal; he had been in charge of East Bay distribution. It was his job to be sure the red boxes on the street corners were filled with The Providence Journal in the morning and The Evening Bulletin at night. I explained how when I was young, I thought my father had the most important job in the world: making sure everyone received their newspaper, their news. 
 I described how crushed my father had been when the newspaper was sold and he lost his job, and how he descended into alcoholism and vagrancy before being found dead in a hotel room by a desk clerk seeking overdue payment. Though my father's death was not ruled a suicide, he had killed himself nevertheless, as he acknowledged in the letter he left for me in which he expressed regret about throwing his life away and not having been a better dad. 
 But he also used the letter to say that the proudest moment of his life was when I, at age 6, read ''The Night Before Christmas'' aloud to my stepmother's family the year they were married. He told me to be sure at some point in my life to hear Beethoven's Ninth performed live. And he closed by asking that I take care of my younger sister.
 I was 18 by then, living with my aunt and attending community college. The police gave me my father's possessions in a Ziploc bag. There among the change, the eyeglasses and the loose antihistamines was his long-expired Providence Journal employee identification badge. 
 ''It was too much, I think,'' I said to the journalist. ''There was Vietnam, and then everything with my mom, and then he lost his job, and that was the last thing keeping him here.'' I waved my hand to signify ''here'': the world around us, the land of the living.
 It was dark outside. The coffee shop was filled with laptops and conversation. ''You never got a coffee,'' I said.
 He looked at his watch. ''Is there anything else you want to know?''
 I couldn't think of anything else he could possibly tell me, but I asked, almost because it seemed as if he might think it was strange if I didn't, if he ever regretted writing so graphically about my mother's murder. 
 He told me then about a phone call he had received from my grandfather about the article, and how devastated he had sounded. ''He wasn't mad,'' he said. ''He didn't yell.'' He simply wanted the journalist to know he existed. He wanted it known that he was the father of a murdered daughter, this woman who had been killed with as much thought as one gives to stomping on a cockroach.
 I nearly lost all composure at the mention of my grandfather's devastation. He had been a man scarred by war and a childhood in an orphanage, and he had loved his two daughters immeasurably. He had outlived both my parents. But now he was gone, too. 
 The journalist and I shook hands, and I thanked him for his time and his candor. 
 AFTER he ducked out into the night, I stayed for a while in the coffee shop, scraping my thumbnail against the Formica tabletop and thinking of my family. For my father and my grandfather, reading the details of my mother's death had been too much -- the truth had trapped them. But for me, discovering the truth had somehow let me out.
 Maybe this was something passed on to me by my mother. From what little I had been told about her, I gathered that she, too, believed that the truth, no matter how ugly, was necessary. I hadn't been able to get that kind of truth from my family, so I turned to a man, a complete stranger, to understand. 
 My meeting with him was not a date, despite how I'd nervously smoothed my hair throughout and worried about coffee stains on my teeth. Yet it reminded me right then of a brief love affair, the kind you have when you are about to move from a familiar place to somewhere new, and you begin a romance with a built-in expiration. 
 And when the time comes for the affair to end, you are sad but grateful, because having had someone who understood you perfectly in that moment helps you make the transition, allows you to walk into the uncertain night and toward that unknown place with a clearer sense of who you are and where you've been, your heart filled with all that's gone and with everything that you will never, ever stop loving.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Street Corners vs. Cul de Sacs'' (Everybody's Business, Jan. 10) which described how homes in ''walkable'' areas might better keep their value in an economic slump: 
 Savvy homebuyers are increasingly looking at these neighborhoods not only for their convenience and location, but also for their health benefits. Having fresh-food stores and parks just a short walk from your front door is crucial for reducing your risk to chronic diseases like obesity and diabetes. But as walkable neighborhoods become ever more desirable, we must make sure low-income families are not priced out of them. All people should have access to these powerful benefits.

Shareholders Suggest
 Minimum Sale Prices
 QBecause of the economy, the sale prices in our New Jersey co-op building are falling. The thinking of some shareholders is to have the board decide on a minimum sale price for apartments. Is this allowed?
 A Donald Onorato, a co-op and condo lawyer in Hackensack, N.J., says that while there is no specific provision in New Jersey law on this issue, and though the courts have not addressed it, it is probably not a good idea. 
 ''Market forces should dictate sales prices,'' Mr. Onorato said, ''and any restrictions on price is just bad policy.'' He noted that even if a board set a ''market value'' price for an apartment, owners sometimes had to sell at ''fire sale'' prices because of their financial circumstances. ''Restricting a shareholder's right to sell may cause the shareholder to fall behind in maintenance payments, which would adversely affect the whole co-op,'' he said. 
 Surviving Partner's 
 Rights in a Co-op
 QMy partner and I bought a co-op together as joint tenants with right of survivorship. He died earlier this year. I continue to live in the apartment and pay the share-loan and maintenance. What steps do I take to get his name removed from the stock certificate and proprietary lease?
 A Allen H. Brill, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, said that when a co-op apartment is owned by joint tenants with right of survivorship, upon the death of one owner the apartment automatically is owned solely by the survivor, who need not take any action. Mr. Brill said that if the writer wanted to have the stock certificate and proprietary lease in his name alone, he would need to comply with the requirements in the co-op's governing documents for doing so and would probably have to pay a fee -- typically $500 to $1,000. 
 He noted that before making the change the co-op would most likely require the consent of the lender holding the share-loan. And because most loan documents make all parties -- and their estates -- liable for loans they take out, the writer should determine whether the lender will consent to removing the deceased partner's name from the loan. 
 When Stabilized Units
 Are Deregulated
 QI live in a rent-stabilized apartment in Manhattan. I have heard that rent-stabilized apartments become ''destabilized'' when the rent reaches $2,000 or the renter's income exceeds a certain amount. Is this correct and, if so, is a landlord entitled to know a renter's income?
 A David Ng, a Manhattan lawyer who represents tenants, said that for a landlord to de-regulate a rent-stabilized apartment under what is known as the luxury decontrol provision of the rent laws, the landlord must apply to the state's Division of Housing and Community Renewal for an order of deregulation.
 He says the law allows for deregulation if the regulated rent is $2,000 or more and the tenant's federal adjusted gross income -- as reported on the New York State tax return -- exceeded $175,000 for the two years before the application.
 ''The landlord is only entitled to ask the tenant if his federal adjusted income exceeded $175,000 for both years,'' Mr. Ng said, adding that the division can ask the state's Department of Finance to verify only whether the reported income exceeded the limit. JAY ROMANO

HEADLINE: Partners of Nolan Ryan Have Deal to Buy Rangers

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
A group led by Chuck Greenberg and Nolan Ryan said late Saturday that it had reached a deal to purchase the Texas Rangers from the Hicks Sports Group, potentially ending a nearly yearlong struggle for the team. 
 Greenberg, a lawyer from Pittsburgh, and Ryan, the team's current president, must still win approval of 75 percent of the Major League Baseball owners as well as several banks that hold debt in the Hicks Sports Group. The Greenberg-Ryan group must also finish raising the money needed.
Their announcement did not include a value for the deal. But the team, the lease on its ballpark in Arlington, Tex., and most of the property surrounding the park are believed to be worth about $570 million. Thomas O. Hicks, whose Hicks Sports Group had stacked up sizable debts, would keep a small stake in the ball club. 
 If all commitments are met, the deal could be completed by April, the two sides said.
 ''In the short term, Chuck, Nolan and I will focus our attention not only on the transaction but on making sure the club operates in a business-as-usual manner,'' Hicks said in a statement. ''Pitchers and catchers report in just 26 days.''
 The group led by Greenberg and Ryan beat out two other bidders for the Rangers. The deal was closed more than a week after the group's 30-day negotiating window closed. Officials from Major League Baseball helped keep the talks alive.
 Greenberg will become the chief executive of Rangers Baseball Express, and Ryan will continue as the president. The lead investors in Rangers Baseball Express will be Ray Davis from Dallas and the family of Bob and Janice Simpson from Fort Worth.
 The Hicks Sports Group bought the Rangers in 1998 and defaulted on $525 million in loans in March. At the time, Hicks said, ''The current situation simply does not make economic sense.''
 Hicks originally wanted to sell a minority share in the Rangers to help pay off those debts, but he ultimately had to sell a majority stake.

HEADLINE: A New Take on Refinancing

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
SEARCHING for home mortgage rates online often means submitting information to a Web site, then withstanding a flurry of calls and e-mail messages from brokers and lenders trying to sell a loan.
 Refinance.com, which made its debut this month, aims to simplify the process for those looking to refinance their mortgages, by connecting a borrower with just one lender. In seeking would-be borrowers, it maintains that they would most likely receive a lower interest rate. 
 The claim has merit, according to at least one participating lender. Industry analysts, meanwhile, said the site was worth trying. 
 ''It's a great place to go, even if you don't end up going through with the loan,'' said Jim Bruene, the publisher of the Online Banking Report. He noted, for example, that the site offers a free look at one's credit report. 
 The site, which is owned by Home-Account.com, a mortgage advisory service that started in San Francisco last year, uses a different approach in matching borrowers with lenders. 
 Borrowers first submit their Social Security numbers, and the site completes a ''soft pull,'' or borrower's inquiry, of their credit report and score, thereby sparing them any of the damage that often results from a more formal inquiry from creditors.
 Borrowers then provide an estimated value of their home, along with the size of the loan they are seeking and other basic financial information. The site also requires them to complete a brief questionnaire -- to determine, for instance, whether they would be comfortable with a fixed-rate or an adjustable-rate loan.
 Refinance.com then ranks a user's creditworthiness; if it is below an ''A,'' the site suggests ways to improve the credit profile. Next it suggests loan packages that would best suit the borrower's financial circumstances and risk preference.
 Finally, the borrower is offered a page of loan quotations from lenders, along with the option to confirm a deal with one tentatively. Closing costs are included, and assuming the borrower's information is generally accurate, the lender is required to honor those loan terms. The terms include a ''True Cost,'' which gives the entire cost of each loan for the length of time the borrower expects to stay in a home.
 Other online services require less information, but share it with many lenders.
 Keith Luedeman, the chief executive of Goodmortgage.com in Charlotte, N.C., and one of 18 participating lenders, says the terms he offers on Refinance.com are lower than those he would offer on other multilender mortgage sites. Mr. Luedeman said that Refinance.com's application process increases the chances that he will close a loan with a borrower. Also, he said, the site charges him less than other Web sites for delivering to him each prospective borrower. Marketing costs drop as a result, allowing him to make cheaper loans, he said.
 Mr. Bruene of the Online Banking Report says one of Refinance.com's chief assets is Jack M. Guttentag, a professor of finance emeritus at the University of Pennsylvania and an authority on mortgages. Home-Account.com hired Mr. Guttentag, an advocate for more transparent lending practices, to oversee the application process.
 In a telephone interview, Mr. Guttentag says one weakness in Refinance.com's approach is that it relies on borrowers to estimate their home's value, even though such estimates are frequently inflated. In the coming months, he said, Refinance.com will devise another method. 
 While Refinance.com is free, subscribers to the site's parent, Home-Account.com, pay $10 a month, for advice on finding all types of home mortgages and improving their credit scores. 
 Mark Goldstein, the chief executive of Home-Account.com, says he will most likely eliminate the subscription fee soon, if Refinance.com generates enough income. That would essentially make Refinance.com's services available to all mortgage borrowers, not just current owners.

HEADLINE: James Patterson Inc.

BYLINE: By JONATHAN MAHLER. 
Jonathan Mahler, a contributing writer for the magazine, is the author of ''The Challenge: How a Maverick Navy Officer and a Young Law Professor Risked Their Careers to Defend the Constitution -- and Won,'' which is just out in paperback.

 BODY:
 Like most authors, James Patterson started out with one book, released in 1976, that he struggled to get published. It sold about 10,000 copies, a modest, if respectable, showing for a first novel. Last year, an estimated 14 million copies of his books in 38 different languages found their way onto beach blankets, airplanes and nightstands around the world. Patterson may lack the name recognition of a Stephen King, a John Grisham or a Dan Brown, but he outsells them all. Really, it's not even close. (According to Nielsen BookScan, Grisham's, King's and Brown's combined U.S. sales in recent years still don't match Patterson's.) This is partly because Patterson is so prolific: with the help of his stable of co-authors, he published nine original hardcover books in 2009 and will publish at least nine more in 2010. 
 There are many different ways to catalog Patterson's staggering success. Here are just a few: Since 2006, one out of every 17 novels bought in the United States was written by James Patterson. He is listed in the latest edition of ''Guinness World Records,'' published last fall, as the author with the most New York Times best sellers, 45, but that number is already out of date: he now has 51 -- 35 of which went to No. 1. 
 Patterson and his publisher, Little, Brown & Co., a division of the Hachette Book Group, have an unconventional relationship. In addition to his two editors, Patterson has three full-time Hachette employees (plus assistants) devoted exclusively to him: a so-called brand manager who shepherds Patterson's adult books through the production process, a marketing director for his young-adult titles and a sales manager for all his books. Despite this support staff and his prodigious output, Patterson is intimately involved in the publication of his books. A former ad executive -- Patterson ran J. Walter Thompson's North American branch before becoming a full-time writer in 1996 -- he handles all of his own advertising and closely monitors just about every other step of the publication process, from the design of his jackets to the timing of his books' release to their placement in stores. ''Jim is at the very least co-publisher of his own books,'' Michael Pietsch, Patterson's editor and the publisher of Little, Brown, told me.
 A couple of months ago, I sat in on one of Patterson's regular meetings with Little, Brown to discuss the marketing and publicity for his coming titles. The meeting was held not, as you might expect, at the publisher's offices in Midtown Manhattan but in the living room of Patterson's Palm Beach home, a canary yellow Spanish-style house on a small island in Lake Worth. Patterson's wife, Sue, a tall, athletic-looking blonde whom he met at J. Walter Thompson, served coffee and gooey chocolate-chip cookies to the guests: Pietsch; Megan Tingley, the publisher of Little, Brown's young-readers books; and David Young, the C.E.O. of Hachette.
 Pietsch and Tingley showed mock-ups of covers and presented ideas they had been working on. From the plush, caramel-colored couch facing them, Patterson, who is a trim 62 with a habitual slouch and laconic manner well suited to his dry sense of humor, acted as creative director, a familiar role from his years in advertising. At one point, the conversation turned to the next installment in Patterson's Michael Bennett series, which revolves around a Manhattan homicide detective and widower with 10 multiracial adopted children (''Cheaper by the Dozen'' meets ''Die Hard,'' as Patterson describes it). Pietsch mentioned a possible promotional line, ''New York Has a New Hero.'' Patterson instantly amended it: ''Finally, New York Has a Hero.''
 A number of former Little, Brown employees who attended these sorts of meetings with Patterson in the 1990s and early 2000s described him to me as low-key but intimidating, more cutthroat adman than retiring writer -- a kind of real-life Don Draper. Unsatisfied with publishing's informal approach to marketing meetings, Patterson had expected corporate-style presentations, complete with comprehensive market-share data and sales trends. ''A lot of authors are just grateful to be published,'' Holly Parmelee, Patterson's publicist from 1992 to 2002, told me several weeks earlier. ''Not Jim. His attitude was that we were in business together, and he wanted us both to succeed, but it was not going to be fun and games.''
 But that was when Patterson was still making a name for himself and fighting for his publisher's full attention. Now that he is the world's bestselling author and Little, Brown's most prized possession, Patterson seemed agreeable, easygoing. Even when he shot down an idea, like Pietsch's suggestion that Patterson promote the new Michael Bennett book with a day of events in all five boroughs, he did so gently: ''I just don't want for it to be like one of those things when an athlete goes through and shakes four hands.'' Halfway through the meeting, Patterson suggested that they take a short break to listen to some songs from a musical he's developing based on his romance novel ''Sundays at Tiffany's.''
 When the meeting was over, Patterson and his wife drove everyone to lunch in their matching Mercedes sedans. On our way to the restaurant, they took us past their future home, an oceanfront mansion in Palm Beach that they bought last year for $17.4 million and are now in the midst of renovating. ''There's my little cottage,'' Patterson said as the 20,000-square-foot house came into view.
 ACCORDING TO FORBES magazine, Patterson earned Hachette about $500 million over the last two years. Hachette disputes the accuracy of these numbers but wouldn't provide me with different ones. Regardless, it seems safe to assume that Patterson, who puts out more best sellers in any given year than many publishing houses, is responsible for a meaningful portion of the company's annual revenues. ''I like to say that Jim is the rock on which we build this company,'' David Young told me in his office one recent morning.
 Like movie studios, publishing houses have long built their businesses on top of blockbusters. But never in the history of publishing has the blockbuster been so big. Thirty years ago, the industry defined a ''hit'' novel as a book that sold a couple of hundred thousand copies in hardcover. Today a book isn't considered a blockbuster unless it sells at least one million copies.
 The story of the blockbuster's explosion is, paradoxically, bound up with that of publishing's recent troubles. They each began with the wave of consolidation that swept through the industry in the 1980s. Unsatisfied with publishing's small margins, the new conglomerates that now owned the various publishing houses pressed for bigger best sellers and larger profits. Mass-market fiction had historically been a paperback business, but publishers now put more energy and resources into selling these same books as hardcovers, with their vastly more favorable profit margins. At the same time, large stores like Barnes & Noble and Borders were elbowing out independent booksellers. Their growing dominance of the market gave them the leverage to demand wholesale discounts and charge hefty sums for favorable store placement, forcing publishers to sell still more books. Big-box stores like Costco accelerated the trend by stocking large quantities of books by a small group of authors and offering steep discounts on them. Under pressure from both their parent companies and booksellers, publishers became less and less willing to gamble on undiscovered talent and more inclined to hoard their resources for their most bankable authors. The effect was self-fulfilling. The few books that publishers invested heavily in sold; most of the rest didn't. And the blockbuster became even bigger.
 Patterson has been a beneficiary of the industry's shifting economics, but he was also a catalyst for change at Little, Brown and in the world of publishing in general. When Patterson published his breakout book, ''Along Came a Spider,'' in 1993, Little, Brown was still a largely literary house, whose more commercial authors included the historian William Manchester, biographer of Winston Churchill. Patterson's success in the subsequent years encouraged Little, Brown to fully embrace mass-market fiction. But more than that, Patterson almost single-handedly created a template for the modern blockbuster author.
 There were, of course, blockbuster authors before Patterson, among them Mario Puzo, James Michener and Danielle Steel. But never had authors been marketed essentially as consumer goods, paving the way for a small group of writers, from Charlaine Harris to Malcolm Gladwell, to dominate best-seller lists -- often with several titles at a time -- in the same way that brands like Skippy and Grey Poupon dominate supermarket shelves. ''Until the last 15 years or so, the thought that you could mass-merchandise authors had always been resisted,'' says Larry Kirshbaum, former C.E.O. of the Time Warner Book Group, which owned Little, Brown until 2006. ''Jim was at the forefront of changing that.''
 The lesson was not easily learned. Publishing is an inherently conservative business. Patterson repeatedly challenged industry convention, sometimes over the objections of his own publisher. When Little, Brown was preparing to release ''Along Came a Spider,'' Patterson tried to persuade his publisher that the best way to get the book onto best-seller lists was to advertise aggressively on television. Little, Brown initially balked. Bookstores typically base their stocking decisions on the sales of an author's previous books, and Patterson's had not done particularly well. This was going to be the first of several novels about an African-American homicide detective in Washington, D.C., named Alex Cross; the prevailing wisdom was that the audience for a series built around a recurring character needed to be nurtured gradually. What's more, large-scale TV advertising was rare in publishing, not only because of the prohibitive cost but also for cultural reasons. The thinking was that selling a book as if it were a lawn-care product could very well backfire by turning off potential readers.
 Patterson wrote, produced and paid for a commercial himself. It opened with a spider dropping down the screen and closed with a voice-over: ''You can stop waiting for the next 'Silence of the Lambs.' '' Once Little, Brown saw the ad, it agreed to share the cost of rolling it out over the course of several weeks in three particularly strong thriller markets -- New York, Chicago and Washington. ''Along Came a Spider'' made its debut at No. 9 on the New York Times hardcover best-seller list, ensuring it favorable placement near the entrance of bookstores, probably the single biggest driver of book sales. It rose to No. 2 in paperback and remains Patterson's most successful book, with more than five million copies in print.
 It's not hard to understand the popularity of ''Along Came a Spider.'' It's a police procedural with an uncomplicated yet ever-twisting plot, some sex, betrayal and plenty of violence. The book's hero, Cross, is smart and tough, yet sensitive and vulnerable. He has a Ph.D. in forensic psychology from Johns Hopkins, lost his wife in a drive-by shooting -- leaving him to raise his two children alone -- plays Gershwin on a beat-up baby-grand piano and volunteers at the soup kitchen of his local parish. Still, hundreds of suspenseful, fast-paced novels are published each year; few become successful, let alone blockbusters. It's entirely possible, even quite likely, that without those ads, ''Along Came a Spider '' never would have made the best-seller list, and that James Patterson would now be just another thriller writer.
 Patterson quickly turned Alex Cross into a booming franchise, encouraging Little, Brown to unify the series with a single jacket style -- shiny, with big type and bold, colorful lettering -- and titles drawn from nursery rhymes (''Kiss the Girls,'' ''Pop Goes the Weasel,'' ''The Big Bad Wolf''), with their foreboding sense of innocence interrupted. ''Jim was sensitive to the fact that books carry a kind of elitist persona, and he wanted his books to be enticing to people who might not have done so well in school and were inclined to look at books as a headache,'' Kirshbaum says. ''He wanted his jackets to say, 'Buy me, read me, have fun -- this isn't ''Moby Dick.'' ' ''
 Patterson built his fan following methodically. Instead of simply going to the biggest book-buying markets, he focused his early tours and advertising efforts on cities where his books were selling best: like a politician aspiring to higher office, he was shoring up his base. From there, he began reaching out to a wider audience, often through unconventional means. When sales figures showed that he and John Grisham were running nearly neck and neck on the East Coast but that Grisham had a big lead out West, Patterson set his second thriller series, ''The Women's Murder Club,'' about a group of women who solve murder mysteries, in San Francisco. 
 No sooner had Patterson established himself in the thriller market than he started moving into new genres. Kirshbaum didn't initially like the idea; he was worried that Patterson would confuse his thriller fans. Patterson's first nonthriller, ''Miracle on the 17th Green,'' published in 1996, did very well. That same year, Patterson wanted to try publishing more than one book despite Little, Brown's view that he would cannibalize his own audience. In addition to ''Miracle on the 17th Green,'' Patterson published ''Hide and Seek'' and ''Jack and Jill,'' each of which was a best seller. From there, Patterson gradually added more titles each year. Not only did more books mean more sales, they also meant greater visibility, ensuring that Patterson's name would almost always be at the front of bookstores, with the rest of the new releases. Patterson encountered similar resistance when he introduced the idea of using co-authors, which Little, Brown warned would dilute his brand. Once again, the books were best sellers. ''Eventually, I stopped fighting him and went along for the ride,'' Kirshbaum says.
 Patterson's vision of a limitless empire forced Little, Brown to reorder its priorities. Publishers have finite resources, and the demands of publishing Patterson were extraordinary even for a blockbuster author. Some Little, Brown editors worried that other books were suffering as a result. ''To have one writer really start needing, and even demanding, the lion's share of energy and attention was difficult,'' Sarah Crichton, Little, Brown's publisher from 1996 to 2001, told me. ''There were times when some of us resented that. When Jim felt that resentment, he roared back. And he was too powerful to ignore.''
 Crichton says she was continually surprised by the success of Patterson's books. To her, they lacked the nuance and originality of other blockbuster genre writers like Stephen King or Dean Koontz. ''Jim felt his ambitions weren't being taken seriously enough,'' Crichton says. ''And in retrospect, he was probably right.''
 WHEN I VISITED Patterson one day in Florida this fall, his wife met me at the door in tennis whites. Patterson soon followed in a white polo shirt, pleated blue trousers and boat shoes. He stopped in the kitchen to pour himself a glass of orange Fanta and led me upstairs to his home office, an airy, uncluttered wood-paneled room overlooking a lap pool -- Sue, who is 10 years his junior, was an all-American swimmer at the University of Wisconsin in the late 1970s -- and the Intracoastal Waterway.
 Patterson's bookshelves are evenly divided between thrillers -- books by Michael Connelly and Jeffrey Deaver -- and more highbrow, literary fare like Philip Roth, John Cheever and Denis Johnson. When I asked him what he was reading now, Patterson mentioned ''Wolf Hall,'' by Hilary Mantel, the winner of the 2009 Man Booker Prize, and ''The Power Broker,'' Robert Caro's doorstop biography of Robert Moses. ''My favorite books are very dense ones,'' Patterson told me. ''I love 'One Hundred Years of Solitude,' and I'm a big James Joyce fan -- well, at least until 'Finnegans Wake.' He kind of lost me there.''
 There is no computer in Patterson's office; he writes in longhand on a legal pad and gives the pages to his assistant to type up. Hanging above the round wooden table where he works is a photograph of President Clinton taken during the Monica Lewinsky scandal walking down the steps of Marine One with a copy of Patterson's ''When the Wind Blows'' tucked under his arm. (Patterson's popularity in Washington is apparently bipartisan: the wall of one of his downstairs bathrooms is plastered with fan mail from both George Bushes.) Neatly arranged on an adjacent L-shaped desk were 23 stacks of paper of varying heights, Patterson's works in progress. 
 Patterson grew up in Newburgh, N.Y., the son of a tough man who overcame a difficult childhood. Raised in the local poorhouse by a single mother, Patterson's father earned a scholarship to Hamilton College and dreamed of becoming a writer or a diplomat but wound up selling insurance. ''He didn't have a father, and I don't think he knew how to do it,'' Patterson told me. (When his father retired, he wrote a novel and showed it to Patterson, already an established author. Patterson gave him the same advice he gives all first-time novelists: Write another one.)
 Patterson discovered books late for a man who now makes a fortune writing them. Right after his senior year in high school, his family moved to a suburb of Boston, and Patterson got a job working nights and weekends as an aide at McLean Hospital in Belmont. With nothing else to do on his overnight shifts, he guzzled coffee and read.
 At first, Patterson's literary taste ran toward the highbrow -- Jerzy Kosinski, Jean Genet, Evan S. Connell. ''I was a snob,'' he says. After graduating from Manhattan College in 1969, Patterson was given a free ride to Vanderbilt University's graduate program in English literature but dropped out after just one year. ''I had found two things that I loved, reading and writing,'' he told me. ''If I became a college professor, I knew I was going to wind up killing them both off.''
 Instead, Patterson moved to New York and got a job as a junior copywriter at J. Walter Thompson. He also started reading commercial books like ''The Exorcist'' and ''The Day of the Jackal.'' ''I always felt I could write a reasonable literary novel, but not a great one,'' he says. ''Then I thought, I can do this. I understand it, and I like it.'' Patterson set up a typewriter on the kitchen table of his small apartment on 100th Street and Manhattan Avenue and wrote after work every night and on weekends. The result was his first novel, ''The Thomas Berryman Number.''
 More than a dozen publishers rejected Patterson's manuscript before his agent, whom Patterson found in a newspaper article, finally sold it to Little, Brown for $8,500. ''I remember going up to Boston -- Little, Brown was still in Boston then -- and walking into this library with a huge fireplace,'' Patterson recalls of his first visit to his publisher. ''On the bookshelves were all of these other Little, Brown books, 'Catcher in the Rye,' 'The French Lieutenant's Woman,' 'The Executioner's Song.' I'm thinking, They're going to publish me? This is so cool.''
 ''The Thomas Berryman Number'' is the story of a newspaperman in Nashville who is assigned to cover the assassination of a local politician and ends up on the trail of his murderer, a professional killer from the Texas panhandle named Thomas Berryman. The action bounces around a lot, ricocheting between Berryman's various murders, the newspaperman's reporting and his subsequent effort to turn his articles on the case into a book. ''Berryman'' bears none of the hallmarks of Patterson's later thrillers. It's more brooding and stylized, more classically noir. The bad guy -- Berryman -- is not a sadist or a psychopathic serial killer; he's a hired gun. There is no real good guy, other than the reporter and narrator. At its best, the prose can call to mind Raymond Chandler. Here's Berryman in the book's opening pages, about to hitch a ride out of Texas with a man he would soon kill: ''Thomas Berryman shaded his sunglasses so he could see the approaching car better. A finely made coil of brown dust followed it like a streamer. Buzzards crossed its path, heading east toward Wichita Falls.''
 The book won a prestigious Edgar Award for a first novel from the Mystery Writers of America. No doubt, some of those who praised it at the time would now say Patterson has failed to live up to its literary promise. That's not how Patterson sees it. ''It's more convoluted, more bleak -- more of the sort of thing that some people will find praiseworthy,'' he says of ''The Thomas Berryman Number.'' ''The sentences are superior to a lot of the stuff I write now, but the story isn't as good. I'm less interested in sentences now and more interested in stories.''
 After ''The Thomas Berryman Number,'' Patterson wrote several more books for a number of different publishers that were neither successful nor critically acclaimed. In 1980, he tried his hand at the ''demonic child'' genre -- memorably popularized by the film ''Rosemary's Baby''-- with the horror novel ''Virgin'' (which was later retitled and published as ''Cradle and All''). In 1987, the year the movie ''Wall Street'' was released, he published a Wall Street thriller called ''Black Market.''
 Patterson is unsentimental about his early, somewhat clumsy attempts at popular fiction. ''That's an absolutely horrifying book,'' he says of his 1977 novel, ''Season of the Machete,'' the story of a sadistic husband-and-wife team who carry out a series of gory machete murders on a Caribbean island. ''I actually tell people not to read it.''
 Several weeks later, I witnessed this firsthand at one of Patterson's signings. When a woman handed him a copy of the book to autograph, he groaned. ''Not my best work,'' Patterson said. ''It's scaring me half to death,'' the woman answered. ''Don't read it,'' Patterson replied.
 WHAT IS PERHAPS most remarkable about the Patterson empire is the sheer volume of books it produces. The nine hardcovers a year are really only the beginning. Nearly all of those books are published a second and third time, first as traditional paperbacks, then as pocket-size, mass-market paperbacks. ''Scarcely a week goes by when we aren't publishing something by James Patterson,'' Young told me, only half-joking.
 This summer, Patterson will begin his fourth thriller series, ''Private,'' which centers on a detective agency with branches all over the world. In addition, he does frequent thriller one-offs, including an annual summer beach read, usually set at or near a resort.
 The thriller genre is generally not for the squeamish, but Patterson's tend to be especially graphic, and the violence often involves sociopathic sexual perversion and attractive young women. For instance, the villain in his second Alex Cross novel, ''Kiss the Girls,'' is a psychopath who kidnaps, rapes and tortures college girls in an underground bunker; at one point, he even feeds a live snake into the anus of one of his victims.
 As long as there has been mass-market fiction, it has had its detractors. In the late Victorian era, the English poet and cultural critic Matthew Arnold denounced ''the tawdry novels which flare in the bookshelves of our railway stations, and which seem designed . . . for people with a low standard of life.'' Yet even within the maligned genre, Patterson has some especially nasty critics. The Washington Post's thriller reviewer, Patrick Anderson, called ''Kiss the Girls'' ''sick, sexist, sadistic and subliterate.'' Stephen King has described Patterson as ''a terrible writer.'' 
 Patterson has written in just about every genre -- science fiction, fantasy, romance, ''women's weepies,'' graphic novels, Christmas-themed books. He dabbles in nonfiction as well. In 2008, he published ''Against Medical Advice,'' a book written from the perspective of the son of a friend who suffers from Tourette's syndrome, and last year, he took on the supposed murder of the child pharaoh King Tut.
 Patterson's fastest-growing franchise is his young-adult books. He published his first Y.A. title, ''Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment,'' in 2005, not long after the languishing genre was jump-started by blockbusters like ''Harry Potter'' and ''Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants.'' Last month, he introduced his third Y.A. series, ''Witch and Wizard,'' a dystopian fantasy about a teenage brother and sister who wake up to discover that they are living in a totalitarian regime and that they have supernatural powers that have made them enemies of the state. Despite some negative prepublication reviews, the book was critic-proof, making its debut at No. 1 on the Times best-seller list for children's chapter books.
 Each of Patterson's series has its own fan base, but there are also plenty of people who read everything he writes. His books all share stylistic similarities. They are light on atmospherics and heavy on action, conveyed by simple, colloquial sentences. ''I don't believe in showing off,'' Patterson says of his writing. ''Showing off can get in the way of a good story.'' 
 Patterson's chapters are very short, which creates a lot of half-blank pages; his books are, in a very literal sense, page-turners. He avoids description, back story and scene setting whenever possible, preferring to hurl readers into the action and establish his characters with a minimum of telegraphic details. The first chapter of ''The Swimsuit,'' a recent thriller with a villain who abducts women for pornographic snuff films, opens with the kidnapping of a supermodel on a beach in Hawaii:
 ''Kim McDaniels was barefooted and wearing a blue-and-white-striped Juicy Couture minidress when she was awoken by a thump against her hip, a bruising thump. She opened her eyes in the blackness, as questions broke the surface of her mind.
 ''Where was she? What the hell was going on?''
 TO MAINTAIN HIS frenetic pace of production, Patterson now uses co-authors for nearly all of his books. He is part executive producer, part head writer, setting out the vision for each book or series and then ensuring that his writers stay the course. This kind of collaboration is second nature to Patterson from his advertising days, and it's certainly common in other creative industries, including television. But writing a novel is not the same thing as coming up with jokes for David Letterman or plotting an episode of ''24.'' Books, at least in their traditional conception, are the product of one person's imagination and sensibility, rendered in a singular, unreproducible style and voice. Some novelists have tried using co-authors, usually with limited success. Certainly none have taken collaboration to the level Patterson has, with his five regular co-authors, each one specializing in a different Patterson series or genre. ''Duke Ellington said, 'I need an orchestra, otherwise I wouldn't know how my music sounds,' '' Pietsch told me when I asked him about Patterson's use of collaborators. ''Jim created a process and a team that can help him hear how his music sounds.'' 
 The way it usually works, Patterson will write a detailed outline -- sometimes as long as 50 pages, triple-spaced -- and one of his co-authors will draft the chapters for him to read, revise and, when necessary, rewrite. When he's first starting to work with a new collaborator, a book will typically require numerous drafts. Over time, the process invariably becomes more efficient. Patterson pays his co-authors out of his own pocket. On the adult side, his collaborators work directly and exclusively with Patterson. On the Y.A. side, they sometimes work with Patterson's young-adult editor, who decides when pages are ready to be passed along to Patterson.
 Some Patterson fans have complained in online forums that his co-written books feel too ''cookie cutter'' and lack the ''roller coaster'' feel of his previous work, but his sales certainly haven't suffered. In at least one instance, Patterson took on a co-author in an effort to boost sales: last year, after noticing he wasn't selling in Scandinavia, he invited Sweden's best-selling crime writer, Liza Marklund, to collaborate with him on an international thriller. Their novel, ''The Postcard Killers,'' is just being published in Sweden and will be out in the U.S. this summer.
 For the most part, though, Patterson draws his co-authors from the vast sea of struggling writers. A few weeks after visiting Patterson, I had lunch with one of his collaborators, Michael Ledwidge, in Manhattan. An amiable 39-year-old redhead in a black leather jacket and jeans, Ledwidge told me he grew up in a large, working-class Irish family in the Bronx. He wanted to be a cop, but when he applied in 1993, the Police Academy was oversubscribed. So he worked as a doorman and started writing a heist novel on the side. When Ledwidge learned that he and James Patterson shared an alma mater, Manhattan College, he delivered his half-finished manuscript to Patterson one morning at J. Walter Thompson. That night, his phone rang.
 ''It must be James Patterson,'' Ledwidge joked to his wife.
 It was. Patterson helped Ledwidge get his first book published and his writing career started. A few books later, Ledwidge had garnered some critical acclaim but not much commercial success. In 2003, Patterson suggested that they collaborate on ''Step on a Crack,'' his first Michael Bennett novel. Ledwidge leapt at the opportunity. The book went straight to No. 1 on the Times best-seller list. One book quickly led to another. In 2005, Ledwidge quit his day job as a cable-splicer at Verizon, left the Bronx for Connecticut and became a full-time co-author for James Patterson.
 Ledwidge told me that he and Patterson have an easy working relationship, that Patterson playfully teases him when he writes a scene that Patterson doesn't like and praises him when he's pleased with something. I asked Ledwidge if he missed writing his own books. ''Honestly? '' he asked. ''Not at all. This is much more fun.''
 ONE NIGHT IN Florida, Patterson and I met his wife and their 11-year-old son, Jack, for dinner at the Palm Beach Grill. When the maitre d' noticed Patterson entering the restaurant, she told him his table was ready. A well-dressed, white-haired woman quickly spun around.
 ''Are you James Patterson?'' she asked excitedly.
 ''Yes,'' Patterson answered.
 ''I just read your last one. What was it called?''
 Patterson hesitated, unsure which book she was talking about. 
 ''It was brutal!'' she woman continued.
 '' 'The Swimsuit'?'' Patterson ventured.
 ''Yeah,'' the woman said. ''Boy, was it brutal! I liked it, but it was brutal!''
 After dinner, Sue and Jack went home, and Patterson and I had another glass of wine and continued talking. Patterson told me that Jack, who had been working on his laptop for most of the meal, only recently started to like reading. It required a deliberate effort on Patterson's part. Beginning a few summers ago, Patterson told Jack he didn't have to do any chores; he just had to read for an hour or so every day. The first summer Jack resisted. The second summer he didn't complain. Last summer, he no longer needed any prodding. Patterson ticked off some of the books Jack had recently read and enjoyed -- ''To Kill a Mockingbird,'' ''A Wrinkle in Time'' and ''Huckleberry Finn'' -- with obvious pride.
 Patterson told me that Jack's initial reluctance to read helped inspire him to move into the Y.A. genre. He wanted to write books for preteens and teenagers that would be fun and easy to read. The young-adult realm was, in one sense, a big leap for an author known for violent thrillers. At the same time, it was a natural fit for Patterson, whose unadorned prose and fast-paced plots are well suited to reluctant readers. Promoting literacy among children has since become a pet cause for him; he has his own Web site, ReadKiddoRead.com, aimed at helping parents choose books for their children. ''There are millions of kids who have never read a book that they liked, and that is a national disgrace,'' Patterson said. ''What I'm trying to do is at least wake up several thousand of them.''
 Later, our conversation turned to Patterson's critics. ''Thousands of people don't like what I do,'' Patterson told me, shrugging off his detractors. ''Fortunately, millions do.'' For all of his commercial success, though, Patterson seemed bothered by the fact that he has not been given his due -- that unlike King or even Grisham, who have managed to transcend their genres, he continues to be dismissed as an airport author or, worse, a marketing genius who has cynically maneuvered his way to best-sellerdom by writing remedial novels that pander to the public's basest instincts. ''Caricature assassination,'' Patterson called it.
 Patterson said too much has been made of his marketing savvy. (A few years ago, a professor at Harvard Business School went so far as to do a case study on him.) To Patterson, the explanation for his success is less complicated. Whether he's writing about a serial killer, a love affair between a doctor and poet in Martha's Vineyard or a middle-aged ad executive who miraculously becomes an exceptional putter and joins the senior golf tour, his books are accessible and engaging. ''A brand is just a connection between something and a bunch of people,'' Patterson told me. ''Crest toothpaste: I always used it, it tastes O.K., so I don't have any particular reason to switch. Here the connection is that James Patterson writes books that bubble along with heroes I can get interested in. That's it.''
 Patterson considers himself as an entertainer, not a man of letters. Still, he bristles when he hears one of his books described as a guilty pleasure: ''Why should anyone feel guilty about reading a book?'' Patterson said that what he does -- coming up with stories that will resonate with a lot of people and rendering them in a readable style -- is no different from what King, Grisham and other popular authors do. ''I have a saying,'' Patterson told me. ''If you want to write for yourself, get a diary. If you want to write for a few friends, get a blog. But if you want to write for a lot of people, think about them a little bit. What do they like? What are their needs? A lot of people in this country go through their days numb. They need to be entertained. They need to feel something.''
 Shortly before we left the restaurant, Patterson brought up ''The Swimsuit'' again. ''I like 'The Swimsuit,' '' he said. ''It's nasty, but I like it. But I think I went a little farther than I needed to. I'm going to tone it down for the paperback.''
 Patterson noticed a look of surprise on my face; it's not every day that an author decides to rewrite one of his books. ''Look,'' he said, ''if you're writing 'Crime and Punishment' or 'Remembrance of Things Past,' then you can sit back and go: 'This is it, this is the book. This is high art. I'm the man, you're not. The end.' But I'm not the man, and this is not high art.''
 Whatever ambivalence once existed toward Patterson inside Little, Brown has long since been replaced by unequivocal enthusiasm and gratitude. Pietsch, who succeeded Crichton as publisher, says Patterson belongs in the same class as Chandler and Dashiell Hammett. ''Every novel of Jim's is master class in terms of plotting, pace and striking the right balance between action and emotional content,'' Pietsch told me. ''I have never read a writer who I think is better at keeping your eye moving forward and your heart moving forward.''
 Thanks in part to Patterson, Little, Brown's identity has changed considerably since he first visited the publisher's former offices in a town house on Beacon Hill in Boston. In addition to Patterson, it is now home to such thriving commercial novelists as Michael Connelly and Stephenie Meyer, author of the wildly popular ''Twilight'' vampire series, as well as consistent best sellers like Malcolm Gladwell and David Sedaris. In 2008, a year in which many of its competitors were laying off employees and shutting down imprints, Little, Brown gave out Christmas bonuses.
 In September, Little, Brown hosted an anniversary dinner in Patterson's honor -- ''20 Years of Publishing James Patterson'' -- in a private room at Daniel, one of the most expensive restaurants in Manhattan. (Patterson left Little, Brown after ''The Thomas Berryman Number'' but returned in 1989, a few years before ''Along Came a Spider,'' with a book called ''The Midnight Club.'') It wasn't the sort of party you see often in the world of publishing, particularly now, with much of the industry in free fall. In addition to a meal of crabmeat salad, beef tenderloin and warm madeleines, the 45 guests were given party favors: bottles of red wine with labels that read ''Vintage Patterson.''
 Days earlier, Hachette Book Group and Patterson's representative, the Washington lawyer Robert Barnett, hammered out the terms of a new 17-book deal. (Forbes reported that the contract is worth at least $150 million, though Little, Brown and Patterson dispute the number.) ''Don't you need to be home writing?'' I joked with Patterson. He told me matter-of-factly that he'd already started 11 of the 17 books, and even finished more than a few of them.
 Some toasts accompanied the dinner. Pietsch talked about the conflicting mythology surrounding who actually discovered Patterson. (''Not only did I know the editor who discovered James Patterson, I once ate a hamburger cooked on his grill.'') Patterson's young-adult editor, Andrea Spooner, recounted her campaign to persuade her father, an English professor, that Patterson was a worthy writer. ('' 'It's worth noting, Daddy, that Dickens was one of the most popular and successful storytellers of his time, too!' '') When Young told the crowd that Patterson ''contributes significantly'' to five of Hachette's six publishing groups, Patterson interjected: ''What am I missing?''
 ''FaithWords,'' Young replied, referring to the company's religious imprint.
 ''I can do that,'' Patterson said.
 Patterson was the last to speak. The only man in the room without a tie, he wore a black T-shirt beneath his dark suit. ''I'm sorry my good friend Stephen King couldn't be here,'' he began. ''It must be bingo night in Bangor.''
 Patterson then proceeded to tell one of his favorite stories about his mother's father, who drove a frozen-foods truck in Upstate New York. During the summer, Patterson said, he would occasionally get up at 4 in the morning to ride along with him. As they drove over a mountain toward his first delivery, Patterson's grandfather, an irrepressibly joyful man, would be singing at the top of his lungs. ''One day he said to me: 'Jim, I don't care what you do when you grow up. I don't care if you drive a truck like I do, or if you become the president. Just remember that when you go over the mountain to work in the morning, you've got to be singing,' '' Patterson went on. ''Well, I am.''
 It's no surprise that Patterson loves what he does. What's not to love? He plays golf most mornings on Donald Trump's Palm Beach course and spends the rest of the day working on guaranteed best sellers for which he is paid millions.
 But the image of Patterson as a carefree man lucky enough to make money doing what he loves is a bit misleading. Patterson is nothing if not relentlessly ambitious. At J. Walter Thompson, he rose from the lowly station of junior copywriter to become the youngest creative director in the firm's history -- along the way dreaming up such ad slogans as ''I'm a Toys 'R' Us kid'' -- and then the C.E.O. of the company's North American operations. And as Patterson is the first to admit, he didn't even like working in advertising. It goes without saying that writing was never just a hobby for him.
 Patterson's current preoccupation is Hollywood. Despite some attempts, including two Alex Cross films (both starring Morgan Freeman), which Patterson doesn't think much of, some made-for-TV movies, a failed ABC series and a lot of books that were optioned but never developed, there still hasn't been a blockbuster film or hit TV show based on one of his novels.
 A few years ago, Patterson hired a former colleague from J. Walter Thompson, Steve Bowen, to oversee the development of his various movie and television projects. In 2007, they signed a deal with Avi Arad, the producer of the ''Spider-Man'' and ''X-Men'' films, to make a movie based on Patterson's ''Maximum Ride'' young-adult series. In addition to trying to make sure that Patterson is more involved in the development process, Patterson and Bowen plan to produce some projects themselves. They have already raised the financing for a new Alex Cross movie that Patterson is helping to write.
 When I met Bowen, a good-looking ex-Marine with a trimmed, graying beard, for coffee in Manhattan several weeks after the dinner at Daniel, he told me that part of his challenge is to change Hollywood's perception of Patterson. He cited Clint Eastwood, whose name was once synonymous with ''Dirty Harry'' and spaghetti westerns, as a model for the sort of image transformation they are aiming to pull off. ''Jim's been wrongly stereotyped out there as the master of slash and gash,'' Bowen said. ''What people don't fully understand is that there's a unique talent and storytelling ability that has allowed him to do what he's done in the book world. He just knows what's going to grab people. The man has a golden gut.'' 
 IN THE MID-1960S,Jacqueline Susann, the author of ''Valley of the Dolls'' (30 million copies sold), famously demonstrated -- via hundreds of bookstore signings -- that even blockbuster books are built one reader at a time. When Patterson was still making his name, he, too, barnstormed the country, signing books late into the night and exhausting publicists. These days, though, Patterson doesn't do many bookstore events. He certainly doesn't need the publicity, and he would rather be home with Sue and Jack. But on a Monday night in mid-November, he turned up at a car-dealership-size Barnes & Noble in a strip mall on Route 17 in Paramus, N.J., to promote his latest Alex Cross novel, ''I, Alex Cross.''
 This is Patterson's 16th Cross book. Since ''Along Came a Spider,'' Cross has been through a lot. He has had several jobs and a number of ill-fated relationships; he has chased down numerous serial killers, a Russian mobster and a cult of goths; and has even written his own novel based on his late uncle's investigation of a series of lynchings in Mississippi in the early 1900s. 
 Patterson came straight from the Newark airport, arriving early to sign the store's ''I, Alex Cross'' stock in a back room. ''We haven't seen you in years,'' said Dennis Wurst, a Barnes & Noble manager of author promotions who stopped by to say hello.
 ''How's business?'' Patterson asked.
 ''It helps when you write an Alex Cross book,'' Wurst answered.
 A month before, Barnes & Noble was caught in the crossfire of a preholiday pricing war between Wal-Mart and Amazon, with Wal-Mart dropping its prices on several hardcover blockbusters, including ''I, Alex Cross,'' to $8.99, more than 50 percent off the retail price. The battle set off a panic inside an already-anxious publishing industry: such deep discounting may help move merchandise, but along with trends like the proliferation of e-readers that instantly deliver many blockbusters for $9.99 or less, it further devalues books. The days of $25 hardcovers are surely numbered. Without those revenues, publishers will be even more reluctant to devote shrinking resources to new, unproven authors, which will, in turn, limit the range of books being published.
 Whatever the future of publishing may hold, Patterson's place in it seems secure. By the time he was introduced at the Paramus store, in excess of 300 people -- more women than men, but fairly evenly divided, with a handful of children as well -- had crowded into the bookstore's large event space to see him. Stragglers were looking vainly for a spot on the wall to lean up against. Patterson, dressed casually in a sweater and slacks, delivered some brief remarks, took a handful of questions and then got down to the main event -- signing books. To avoid a crush of people at the signing table, the staff divided the audience into several groups by letter. They were told that Patterson would autograph any of his books purchased in the Paramus store and one additional title from their own Patterson collection, but that he would not personalize any copies.
 The system quickly broke down. Patterson was soon adding names and short inscriptions to books. He bantered easily with his fans as he wrote. Many asked about Jack; more than one wanted to know if he had brought any pictures.
 ''I skipped work to be here,'' one woman said as her husband snapped a picture of her with Patterson.
 ''That's always a good thing,'' Patterson said.
 ''Well, I'm a police officer, so I guess that's bad,'' the woman replied.
 ''I won't tell,'' Patterson said.
 There is something unique about the relationship between readers and their favorite authors, a sense of emotional intimacy that doesn't exist, say, between sports fans and athletes. Patterson's fans can read him virtually all year. They aren't just addicted to his books; they see him as a constant companion, a part of their lives. One woman asked Patterson to sign a book for her grandmother, who passed away a few days earlier. ''We used to read your books together, and I want to put it in her casket with her,'' she said. Another told Patterson that he got her reading again after a recent stroke. A truck driver said that he had never read any of Patterson's books but that he had listened to every single one of them on the road: ''I don't know what I'd do without them.''
 Still another woman gestured at her elderly mother, whom she was pushing in a wheelchair: ''She just had heart surgery. You make her happy, and that makes me happy.''
 ''And that makes me happy,'' Patterson said.
 After an hour of signing books without interruption, Patterson seemed to be doing fine. ''We're really cooking along here,'' he told his publicist. A half-hour later, though, Patterson was starting to tire. ''This is getting out of hand,'' he said.
 After almost two hours, a voice finally came over the loudspeaker: ''Will all remaining groups please report to the James Patterson signing area.'' Patterson signed his last books, posed for a few photographs with some of the store's employees and got ready to go. ''That was a fairly respectable crowd,'' he said as we walked to the escalator.
 On our way out, Patterson picked up on a theme he raised with me weeks earlier, during our conversation about his detractors. ''This goes to the notion we were talking about in Florida, about my critics -- people who call themselves open-minded but then make judgments about what I write,'' he said. ''Well, these people like it. They're happy. So what's the big deal?''

HEADLINE: Harry Reid Is Complicated.

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY. 
Adam Nagourney is chief national political correspondent for The New York Times. His most recent article for the magazine was a profile of Terry McAuliffe during his campaign for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in Virginia.

 BODY:
HARRY REID WAS HOARSE and hacking, drawn and more stooped than usual on a Sunday morning 12 days before Christmas. It was not yet noon, and Reid was in his second-floor corner office in an empty United States Capitol. He had arrived to bad news. Joseph Lieberman, the independent Connecticut senator, had announced on CBS's ''Face the Nation'' that he would not support the Senate health care plan, which meant that Reid did not have the 60 votes he needed. Lieberman's announcement, which torpedoed a compromise that Reid helped to midwife, caught the Senate majority leader by surprise. Reid had spoken with Lieberman two days earlier, and one of Lieberman's top aides participated in the Saturday-afternoon conference call that Reid orchestrates for Democratic senators who will be appearing on the Sunday talk shows. ''He double-crossed me,'' Reid said stiffly, associates later recounted. ''Let's not do what he wants. Let the bill just go down.'' 
 Rahm Emanuel, the president's chief of staff, arrived at Reid's office not long afterward -- casually dressed, a cup of coffee in one hand -- and after a brisk meeting, a decision was reached: Reid would abandon his compromise, which was intended to appease proponents of a government-run insurance plan. The concession would not sit well with a lot of Democrats, not to mention the powerful constituency of union voters in Nevada, where Reid is up for re-election in November. But there was little discussion. Reid and Emanuel are exemplars of the just-get-it-done style of legislating. As it turned dark outside, Reid began pulling senators aside in the lobby just off the Senate floor, speaking in a strained whisper as he presented the case in characteristically pragmatic terms. ''I'm with you; I'm for you,'' he told Tom Harkin of Iowa, one of the Senate's traditional New Deal Democrats, who was pained that the public option was dying.
 ''Harry has a very good way of sort of bringing you back to reality,'' Harkin told me a few days later, ''this wonderful way of shrugging his shoulders and saying: 'If you can get Lieberman to vote with you, fine. Otherwise, chalk it up and move on.' He calmed me down.''
 Reid looked disconsolate as he shuffled between the Senate chamber and his office, festively decorated for Christmas and bustling with senators and White House officials. The director of the White House Office of Health Reform, Nancy-Ann DeParle, waved down Reid to solicit his view on what sounded like a technical dispute about Medicare. Reid listened, nodding wearily, before drifting out the door. ''You guys figure it out,'' he said.
 Lieberman, who disputes that he misled Reid, was not the only senator in the Democratic caucus complicating the majority leader's life. Ben Nelson of Nebraska was opposing using government money to pay for coverage of abortions. Maria Cantwell of Washington was balking as well; she had been drawing Reid into long, late-night telephone conversations and pressing to make sure that longshoremen were added to the list of unions exempted from a new tax on costly health care plans. And Bernie Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont, was threatening to bolt over the discarding of the public option, a provision that senators like Lieberman refused to support. 
 A week later, Reid announced that he struck a deal with Nelson and had his 60th vote. It was a display of legislative legerdemain that if not pretty -- Nelson's vote cost a promise of millions of dollars to cover Nebraska's Medicaid expenses -- was impressive. Reid needed 60 votes to head off a filibuster, and Republicans were vowing to filibuster everything, which meant he needed all 58 Democrats and both independent senators. He had no margin for error. ''Harry has the toughest job in Washington,'' President Obama told me one afternoon last month, leaning forward in his chair in the Oval Office on the eve of the Senate vote, talking up a legislator whom Obama first met during his four-year tour in the Senate and whom he now sees as pivotal to his success as president. ''He's done as good of a job as anybody could have done. He just grinds it out.''
 The health care negotiations demonstrated Reid's command of the Senate and his sway among his fellow Democrats -- which contrasts with his perhaps equally remarkable inability to master other elements of the contemporary politician's game. Despite Reid's quiet demeanor, he has an almost pathological propensity to say things that get him in trouble. He is a model of indiscipline in a city that feasts on the errant remark. In January, he would have to apologize to President Obama after being quoted in a new book, ''Game Change,'' by John Heilemann and Mark Halperin, as saying that Obama would be able to become the nation's first black president because he was ''light skinned'' and had ''no Negro dialect, unless he wanted to have one.'' Republicans promptly demanded Reid's resignation as majority leader, seizing a chance to push Reid to the sidelines in their ongoing effort to derail health care reform -- and most of the Obama agenda, for that matter. 
 However the health care negotiations end -- with a Rose Garden signing or a last-minute debacle -- Reid has another battle waiting at home: to save his seat in the Senate. The longer Reid has served as Democratic leader, the more Nevada voters have turned against him. It's a challenge that regularly confronts politicians who have to balance the demands of being a Congressional leader with maintaining political viability back home. For the third time in 16 years, Republicans are trying to oust one of the top Democratic leaders in Congress, as they successfully did with the previous Democratic leader in the Senate, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, in 2004, and with Tom Foley in 1994, when he was the speaker of the House. If Reid loses in November, it is hard to imagine either party selecting a Senate or House leader from a competitive state like Nevada anytime soon. ''He lives in a purple state, and he is pursuing a deep-blue agenda, and that's tough,'' Lindsey Graham, a Republican senator from South Carolina, told me. ''He's shown a lot of loyalty to his party and to his caucus to his detriment, and I admire that.'' The cheers for Reid in Washington are not being heard back home: a poll conducted this month on behalf of The Las Vegas Review-Journal found that Nevadans disapproved of the health care bill. Reid's attempt to slip in financing to offset Nevada's Medicaid costs, precisely the kind of vote-getting sweetener that could display his worth to Nevadans, came under fire in Washington, so he withdrew it rather than risk having the bill unravel. 
 For all the power and the glamour -- the personal relationship with a president, the corner office in the Capitol, the place in history -- it is hard to see why anyone would want to be Harry Reid in today's Washington. Reid spent almost all of last year as a partisan leader in a partisan battle, which is pretty much what he should not be doing if he wants Nevadans to send him back for a fifth term. He as much as anyone has the burden of delivering the president's agenda through a Senate that has staggered to the brink of dysfunction. ''The atmosphere in Washington has changed dramatically,'' Reid, who was elected to the Senate in 1986, told me. By nature a pragmatic deal-cutter, Reid is viewed with suspicion by the left, which cannot understand why he has to play ball with the likes of Lieberman. He has to sate a long-deprived and lopsidedly left-leaning Democratic conference hungry to pass big legislation, anxious that its 60-vote margin will evaporate after November. ''When I took over in 2001, no one had high expectations, so everything we did was appreciated,'' Daschle told me last fall. ''Now there's an expectation that we can do everything.'' Reid goes home to Nevada to face polls showing him trailing his opponents -- polls that, if of questionable significance this early, are psychologically debilitating. ''Numbers at this point are really meaningless, but they haunt you and are an indication of the work you have to do,'' Daschle said.
 That Reid is on the line in the midterm election of Obama's first term seems appropriate. It was Obama who moved Nevada back into the Democratic column at a time when Western states had become fertile ground for the party. But the economic anxiety that has settled over the nation is perhaps nowhere more on display than in Reid's home state, which has the highest mortgage-foreclosure rate in the country and is tied with South Carolina and California for the third-highest unemployment rate. Harry Reid has two different missions to fulfill this year -- one for Barack Obama and one for Harry Reid. On many days, the two seem very much at odds.
 A SHARP WIND cut across the desert just before Thanksgiving as an S.U.V. carrying Harry Reid navigated a grid of streets lined with trailers in Searchlight, Nev., whose population of 798 includes the majority leader of the United States Senate. ''This used to be a whorehouse!'' Reid exclaimed, pointing a finger toward a ridge. ''That was one of the biggest whorehouses around. Right there -- you see the fence over there? -- we put a nice new mobile home for my mother after my dad killed himself.'' His father had worked in the gold mines and was an alcoholic; that is one reason, Reid says, that he does not drink. There was not a building (or a whorehouse) in sight as the S.U.V. rumbled over a rise and came upon a scattering of tombstones, poking out of the sand and dirt. Reid ordered the car to stop. The dropping sun threw a golden light over the desert hills. Reid was wearing jeans and had pulled a jacket over a brown knit sweater with brown leather elbow pads.''O.K., Searchlight Cemetery. It's been here since 1900. Where else can you find a place like this?'' he said. ''It's not owned by the county, not by no one. Whatever they want to put in here, they put in here.'' He wandered among the tombstones in this common graveyard, grown over and weathered by the years, pointing out a brother here, a great-grandmother there. ''As Landra knows, I'm going to be buried here,'' he said cheerfully, speaking of his wife. ''She knows she's going to be buried here.''
 By reputation and appearance, Reid, who is 70, is one of the blander elected officials in Washington. Upon closer inspection, he is deeply and deceptively interesting. He is a senator from Nevada who hates gambling (''The only people who make money from gambling are the joints and government''); a backroom deal-maker who does not drink alcohol or coffee; a Washington celebrity who sniffs at the dinner-and-party circuit. ''Senator Daschle went to dinner almost every night with someone,'' he told me. ''I go to dinner never, with anyone, during the week.''He does find time, at least twice a week, to slip on a pair of black Lycra stretch pants to do yoga with Landra at their apartment in the Ritz-Carlton. He has an intolerance for fat people, manifested in asides to aides who seem to be getting portly and an office staff that is suspiciously slim. He was born out of wedlock. He is certainly one of the few members of the Senate to have a Grateful Dead poster, signed by the band's members, hanging in a bathroom at his house. Reid has been an amateur boxer, a Capitol police officer and the chairman of the Nevada Gaming Commission, where his tenure inspired death threats and a character in Martin Scorsese's ''Casino.'' The mezuza on the right side of the doorway in Searchlight is a reminder that Landra was Jewish before they converted to Mormonism.
 Tall and slight, with rimless glasses and neatly trimmed gray hair framing a gaunt face, Reid does not cut a memorable figure. ''I have beady eyes,'' he volunteered to me one day. His voice barely rises above a mumble. ''I have always been one who recognizes my, um, shortcomings,'' he said in November as he sat with his wife in the living room of the house they built eight years ago on a remote patch of land dotted with sagebrush and abandoned gold mines, 60 miles south of Las Vegas. ''Landra and I had a conversation this morning; I hope she's not upset about me telling you this, but she won't stay upset for long if she is.'' Their discussion was about a story in The Washington Post that said, as he put it: '' 'Reid gave a rousing speech, but as usual you could barely hear him.' People are always telling me, writing, you know: 'He has bad posture. He doesn't talk very well. He doesn't look very good.' ''
 Reid is well known for his stumbles, the malapropism or the just plain weird moment like when, in a spasm of confusion and fatigue, he initially voted against his health care bill on Christmas Eve. When Reid goes before the TV cameras -- which is something he does not enjoy doing and, as he would be the first to tell you, is not particularly good at -- he often shows up with an oversize index card with remarks, typed and vetted by his aides, in anticipation of the sensitive question of the moment. He reads the card dutifully in a monotone, eyes down, and then takes a few questions before his communications director, Jim Manley, shouts out, ''Last question!'' 
 Despite, or perhaps because of, these precautions, he takes a schoolboy's delight in acting out, in breaking the rules of a scripted city. At one point last year, Reid announced that the health care vote would be delayed until January no matter what the White House thought, which led Rahm Emanuel to get into his car and arrive at Reid's office, where after a terse exchange between two terse men, Reid agreed to the White House's schedule. He referred to angry protesters at town-hall meetings as ''evilmongers.'' He called George W. Bush a ''liar'' and a ''loser.'' When Bush invited Reid for coffee in the Oval Office in the final weeks of his presidency, the president's dog walked in, and Reid says he insulted the president's pet. ''Your dog is fat,'' he said. 
 ''I'm just who I am, O.K.?'' Reid told me before Christmas. ''I didn't take lessons on how to speak on television, and I don't spend a lot of time worrying about who I am. I don't like to read stuff about me, but I've become accustomed to it: you know, 'Reid misspeaks.' I'd rather people were saying, 'Oh, that guy is a golden-tongued devil.' '' He paused. ''I have no regret over calling Greenspan a political hack. Because he was. The things you heard me say about George Bush? You never heard me apologize about any of them. Because he was. What was I supposed to say? I called him a liar twice. Because he lied to me twice.''
 Manley, who was sitting nearby in Reid's Capitol office, raised his hand to respectfully revise and extend the senator's remarks. ''Just for the record, he did apologize for the loser comment,'' he said.
 ''Yes, but not because he wasn't a loser,'' Reid countered. ''It's because I shouldn't have said that to a group of kids.'' It was a Las Vegas high-school civics class. The apology also came after his most prominent Republican supporter in Nevada, Sig Rogich, a Las Vegas businessman who was a senior adviser to Ronald Reagan, called Reid to tell him that he had crossed a line. 
 The comments about Obama's race may be more problematic, particularly as Reid confronts a bleak re-election landscape in Nevada. After Reid's aides were asked by the politics editor of The Atlantic, Marc Ambinder, on Jan. 8, a Friday night, about the passage in the book, they stayed up until 2:30 a.m., fashioning a statement of apology and drawing up a list of 35 civil rights and political leaders for Reid to call. Manley called Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, to inform him of what was happening and set up a call between the majority leader and the president. Reid telephoned Obama the next day. When Obama asked if there was anything he could do, Reid asked if the president could put out a statement of support. The White House obliged. (A few days later, a Reid aide e-mailed to remind me that Reid has a towering portrait of Martin Luther King Jr. in the foyer of his home in Searchlight.)
 For someone whose life is about discretion -- almost without exception, Democrats describe Reid as trustworthy, loyal and fierce about keeping a confidence -- Reid can sound surprisingly candid when he discusses his colleagues. He was unapologetic about his dust-up over delaying the health care plan with Emanuel, who used to hold the No. 4 leadership post in the House. ''Rahm is a House-oriented guy,'' Reid said in November, as he settled, unnoticed by the late-afternoon gamblers and diners, into a booth at the Searchlight Nugget, a lost-in-time casino where coffee goes for 10 cents a cup. ''It's hard for him and most everyone in the White House to understand how the Senate operates.''
 He said he had been shocked by the behavior of Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican, since returning from his failed bid for the presidency. ''My disappointment -- no, that's the wrong word; I'll try to find a better word. My amazement has been John McCain. I thought he'd turn out to be a statesman, work for things. He's against everything. He's against everything! He didn't used to be against everything.'' 
 He said he thought the White House erred in trying to win the support of Olympia Snowe, the Republican senator from Maine, for a health care compromise. ''As I look back it was a waste of time dealing with her,'' he said, ''because she had no intention of ever working anything out.'' And while making clear that he was not complaining, he said Obama may have been asking for too much in his first year. ''I personally wish that Obama had a smaller agenda,'' he said. ''It would be less work.'' 
 Reid is so self-demeaning and ostensibly deferential that it is easy to overlook his ambition. But it is there: in 2004, he started making calls to line up support to replace Daschle as minority leader even before Daschle officially conceded losing his Senate seat. Yet his comfort in the shadows is what has helped him manage a sea of egos and agendas in a caucus that includes Bernie Sanders on the left and Ben Nelson on the right. He said he skips the Sunday talk shows because he is an anemic television presence, but that gesture, as Reid surely knows, has earned him the loyalty of colleagues who relish the platform, like Charles Schumer of New York and Richard Durbin of Illinois, two members of his leadership team. ''He's not a showboater, and I think that probably does help,'' says David Axelrod, a senior adviser to Obama. But, he added, it ''probably doesn't help him at home.''
 Committee heads, the Senate's traditional barons who lost some power in the past two decades, have found themselves newly ascendant under Reid. ''Other leaders who I've worked with and respect, like Tom Daschle, would say, 'We need a task force; we need to bring in people who aren't chairs,' '' Durbin says. ''Harry is very respectful to committee chairs, and they are loyal to him as a result of that.'' Reid is a transactional politician, unashamed to dole out an earmark to win a vote, a bit of sausage-making that draws him condemnation in editorials. There are days, aides say, when they almost feel like concierges as Reid -- hearing that a fellow senator is going to Las Vegas, and seeing a way to build good will and promote his home state -- asks them to line up restaurant reservations, choice hotel rooms and hard-to-get show tickets. By contrast, ''I have never heard him threaten a member,'' Durbin says. Reid said he disdains the tough-guy style of one of his more famous predecessors, Lyndon Johnson. ''I don't think he'd last for five minutes today,'' Reid said. ''You can't bully.'' Besides, he added: ''I couldn't be Lyndon Johnson if I wanted to be. He was too crude and physical for me.'' 
 For the White House, Reid is a gift in a challenging year. Conciliatory, endlessly patient and pragmatic rather than dogmatic, he has different skills from those of some senators who might otherwise be in his spot -- like Schumer or Durbin -- and he seems suited to this time and this caucus. Nor is he perceived as carrying an ideological agenda. Unlike most of his colleagues, he opposes gun control and abortion, but those views are reflected only when he votes and do not color the way he manages or negotiates a bill. ''Harry by any normal criteria would be considered a moderate Democrat,'' Obama told me. ''He's someone who doesn't think in big ideological terms.'' 
 Reid's legislative skills were on display throughout the months that led to the Christmas Eve vote. By suddenly inserting a public-insurance option into his bill -- catching the White House and some of his colleagues by surprise -- he demonstrated to supporters of the public option that they did not have the votes for it. He got credit from Democrats like Harkin for doing what he could to try to pass it. Lieberman took the blame for killing it. And Reid got his 60 votes.
 THE NOTION that Reid could lose in November seems ludicrous to Sig Rogich. ''Why would we ever want to get rid of the majority leader, arguably the most powerful man in Congress, at a time when Nevada needs him at the table?'' Rogich said, sitting in his Las Vegas office with a view of four casinos: the MGM Grand, Bally's, the Paris and the Bellagio. Reid is surely the most influential senator Nevada has sent to Washington since it became a state 146 years ago. He has delivered millions of dollars in aid and almost single-handedly blocked the federal government from turning Yucca Mountain, 90 miles northwest of Vegas, into a national nuclear-waste repository.
 But of course he could lose. Independents -- whose numbers in Nevada have grown by 25 percent since Reid was last elected -- are put off by the partisan politics that are, by definition, personified by a majority leader. Yet no matter how much he has given himself to the service of Obama's agenda, Reid is not partisan enough for many liberals. And then there are conservative voters, who certainly appear motivated to come out to vote against what they see as an out-of-control big-government agenda advanced by Obama and Reid. ''You have a candidate who hasn't been the most popular elected official in the state, who is pushing an agenda that is completely at odds with the constituents in his state, and you have an economic environment that is the worst the state's ever faced,'' says Danny Tarkanian, one of a half-dozen Republicans lining up for the chance to oppose Reid. He is the son of Jerry Tarkanian, the former University of Nevada, Las Vegas, basketball coach, as big of a celebrity as you can find in Nevada. 
 Polls that show Reid trailing potential opponents may be of little meaning 10 months before an election -- before he has an opponent, much less unleashes the campaign he is preparing. ''Right now he's shadowboxing against himself,'' Emanuel told me. That said, it is significant that 52 percent of Nevadans had an unfavorable view of Reid in a poll published by The Las Vegas Review-Journal this month, before the latest controversy broke; and it's even more significant that that view did not change despite months of sunny Reid campaign advertisements on Nevada television stations. Nate Silver, the political blogger and polling expert, compared Reid's position in the polls with that of Gov. Jon Corzine of New Jersey last fall; Corzine lost with only 45 percent of the vote. What's more, nearly one-third of Nevadans eligible to vote in 2010 have registered since 2004, the last time Reid was on the ballot. The electorate he will face this November is entirely different from the one that sent him to the Senate in 1986, a consequence of representing a state that is growing so fast.
 ''He is vulnerable because he is living in a center-right state and he's lost touch with the people who put him there,'' says Sue Lowden, another prospective Republican challenger, a former television news anchor in Las Vegas who was the No. 2 runner-up for Miss America in 1973 (she was Miss New Jersey). Reid has been in public life in Nevada since he joined the State Assembly in 1968. ''I think there's Reid fatigue,'' Jon Ralston, the political columnist for The Las Vegas Sun, told me. As if that were not enough, there could be two Reids on the ballot this fall: his son, Rory, is running for governor. No one in the Harry Reid camp is happy about this; Harry Reid's voice dropped to an even more imperceptible level than usual when I inquired if he asked Rory to sit this one out. ''Well, I'll talk about anything except my son,'' he said. ''I'm not going to do that. He's been a wonderful son, great example to his brothers and sister. He didn't ask my permission to run, and I didn't think he needed to get it.''
 Reid has won and lost tight elections, and he has been arming himself for this one. He hired a campaign manager a year ago; he already has 14 people on his campaign payroll; and he gave a strategically timed interview last year to announce that he would spend $25 million to keep his seat, a staggering and utterly credible figure that helped finance those early advertisements. His staff has scoured the business and voting records of all of his potential challengers. 
 And he has done what he could to choose his opponent. Jon Porter, a three-term member of Congress, was considered one of Reid's toughest potential foes -- until he was defeated in 2008 by a Democrat, Dina Titus, who benefited from the largess of Reid's political operation. Last August, Dean Heller, a Republican member of Congress and another potentially strong challenger, called Reid to tell him that he would be sitting this one out; Nevada Democrats suspect Heller reconsidered the wisdom of abandoning a safe seat to challenge an incumbent with $25 million in the bank. That leaves a bench of second-tier candidates like Tarkanian and Lowden, who have far less campaign experience, money and institutional backing than Reid.That might be the single-best thing going for him right now.
 African-Americans are expected to make up just 5 percent of the Nevada electorate come November, and the list of people Reid called after President Obama included some of the top black officials in the state, who quickly declared their allegiance to the Senate majority leader. Even so, Reid's comments about Obama do seem likely to feed the enough-already atmosphere that is hurting Reid back home. 
 Still, the bigger and more meaningful test will be the fallout from the bill that has consumed Reid this winter. Obama said he understood why Nevadans are opposed to the health care bill now, but he says that will change. ''Well, if you've got insurance companies spending hundreds of millions of dollars scaring the daylights out of people into thinking that somehow this is a government takeover of health care, that it's unpaid for, that it means huge new taxes on them, that it's going to mean higher premiums -- if that's the information you're getting, shoot, I'd be against it, too,'' the president told me. ''Once this thing is passed and signed, then suddenly The New York Times and other newspapers are going to have a big article saying what does this mean for you, and people will take a look at it and say, 'You know what, this is a lot better deal than I thought.' And I think that will serve Harry very well.'' 
 Reid better hope so. Two days before Christmas, he sat stiffly in a straight-back red leather chair, the fireplace behind him casting a glow over his office on a cold winter morning. From here, Reid could gaze down the National Mall, white with snow, the Washington Monument on the horizon. That day, at least, had been a good day for the senator from Nevada. He had his 60 votes, the reviews were in and Reid, self-effacing or not, was eager to share them with me. He rose from his chair, walked over to his desk and picked up a clip from Politico, a collection of laudatory quotations highlighted in yellow by Reid's staff. ''Every one of these -- look, Ross Baker, a professor at Rutgers -- they all say the same thing,'' he said. ''I'm not tall, dark and handsome. But here's what it says: 'Behind the scenes, his genius really comes to the floor. He's a virtuoso, a legislative technician. Whatever else can be said of health care reform, it's Reid's finest hour.' '' This need for validation was startling, if understandable. Health care will almost certainly be the toughest legislative challenge Reid will ever face. But after this, there are more assignments from Obama in the year ahead, potentially on contentious issues like immigration and climate change. And they are again going to force Reid to balance the demands of his president with his own campaign. ''The caucus has great loyalty to Harry,'' Obama told me. ''So I want Harry there for the rest of my first term.'' 
 Reid has the fortune of carrying out what some see as the most ambitious legislative agenda that a president has handed to Congress in a generation. And that could be his undoing.

HEADLINE: Making a Healthy Lunch, And Making It a Cause

BYLINE: By DANIEL WEINTRAUB. 
Daniel Weintraub has reported on California politics and policy for more than 20 years.

 BODY:
Between them, Kristin Richmond and Kirsten Tobey have worked on Wall Street, traveled the world and taught school from East Africa to Ecuador. Now they make lunch for a living.
 Friends since they met in business school at the University of California, Berkeley, Ms. Richmond and Ms. Tobey founded Revolution Foods Inc. to ride a political and economic wave: surging support for healthier food in school cafeterias.
 Federal nutrition guidelines require subsidized school lunches to meet benchmarks on calories and fat, but they do not require that foods be whole, local, truly nutritious or good to eat. 
 As a result, the standard cafeteria fare is doing little to curb the nation's rising rate of childhood obesity and might even be contributing to it.
 That was the problem that Ms. Richmond and Ms. Tobey identified in a graduate school class and set out to solve. What began as a class project is now a growing company with headquarters in Oakland, 240 employees and operations in Los Angeles, Denver and Washington.
 ''The momentum around this issue is unbelievable,'' said Ms. Tobey in an interview this month.
 Ms. Richmond, 34, the company's chief executive, and Ms. Tobey, 31, the chief operating officer, came together in 2005 just as child obesity and nutrition were moving toward the top of the nation's health policy agenda.
 Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and his wife, Maria Shriver, had made fighting obesity a major priority. Mr. Schwarzenegger signed legislation boosting nutrition standards for school meals and limiting the sale of soda and junk food on campus. He also authorized a pilot project to increase the reimbursement for school breakfasts by 10 cents if the meal included fresh fruits or vegetables.
 Mr. Schwarzenegger is expected to propose new measures this year, and now Michelle Obama has joined the movement, announcing that she will make fighting childhood obesity a special cause in the White House. In a speech this month to the United States Conference of Mayors, Mrs. Obama called it one of the ''biggest threats'' to the American economy.
 As students at Berkeley, Ms. Richmond and Ms. Tobey saw this trend coming. They interviewed dozens of teachers, parents and school officials in the Bay Area to learn more about the school meal business and to find out what kind of change might appeal to the school community.
 ''The teachers said they were embarrassed,'' Ms. Tobey said. ''They were teaching about nutrition in their classrooms and then the kids were going into the lunch room and saying, 'Why are you serving me this?' ''
 So Revolution Foods adopted higher standards than the government requires for school meal programs. The meals are prepared fresh daily and feature foods free of artificial preservatives, colors, flavors and sweeteners. Every lunch includes fresh fruit and vegetables.
 The breakfasts and lunches contain no high-fructose corn syrup or trans fats, the milk is hormone-free and the meats are from cattle that have not been given antibiotics or hormones. Whenever possible, the food is organic and uses locally grown ingredients. Nothing is fried.
 Revolution Foods built a partnership with Whole Foods, the natural foods grocery store chain, and tapped into that company's network of suppliers. Whole Foods also prepared and packaged the first meals Revolution Foods sold to an Oakland charter school as a pilot to see if the business could be viable. 
 Even before that project ended, other local schools began inquiring about the service, and the business quickly grew and attracted capital from investment firms with a social mission, including the Bay Area Equity Fund. Today Revolution Foods is serving more than 30,000 lunches a day, mostly in low-income communities, and still growing.
 Later this year Congress and the president will most likely reauthorize the federal child nutrition program, which subsidizes school meals for poor children. Ms. Richmond and Ms. Tobey say they hope to see that bill increase reimbursements to the schools while targeting any new money to schools that buy or make meals that use whole, fresh foods and healthy ingredients.
 That would improve nutrition for children while boosting Revolution Foods' bottom line. The idea that they could do both has been at the heart of the pair's business plan from the beginning.

 BODY:
THE NEWSScott Brown, a little-known Republican state senator, won a special election to fill the United States Senate seat from Massachusetts vacated by the death of Edward M. Kennedy. 
 BEHIND THE NEWSMartha Coakley, the Democratic state attorney general, began as a heavy favorite but proved to be a weak campaigner, while Mr. Brown tapped into popular frustration with unemployment, Wall Street bailouts and the health care debate. His victory cost the Democrats the 60th Senate vote they need to break Republican filibusters meant to stall President Obama's nominations and legislative initiatives.
 THE NEWS Efforts to pass the health care overhaul bill were thrown into disarray by the upset in the Massachusetts Senate race.
 BEHIND THE NEWS House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the Senate version of the bill could not pass the House unaltered, an option that would have enabled Democrats to sidestep a threatened filibuster. President Obama signaled that he might scale back the bill to just the provisions that had some chance of bipartisan support. Olympia Snowe, the moderate Maine Republican who has backed some aspects of the bill, said it was time to start over.
 THE NEWS President Obama proposed new rules to rein in large financial institutions, limiting their market share and barring them from some risky business activities, like proprietary trading or owning a hedge fund.
 BEHIND THE NEWS ''Never again will the American taxpayer be held hostage by a bank that is too big to fail,'' Mr. Obama vowed. The plan seemed to catch executives off guard in a week when major financial firms were reporting 2009 results (record profits at Goldman Sachs, losses at Bank of America and Citigroup). Investors reacted by pushing bank stocks down sharply.
 THE NEWS The Supreme Court ruled that the government may not ban political spending by companies, unions and others to influence elections.
 BEHIND THE NEWS In the ruling, which overturned two precedents, the court wrote, ''If the First Amendment has any force, it prohibits Congress from fining or jailing citizens, or associations of citizens, for simply engaging in political speech.'' In dissent, Justice John Paul Stevens, above, called equating corporate and human speech a grave error. President Obama said the court ''has given a green light to a new stampede of special-interest money.'' 
 THE NEWS Former Senator John Edwards admitted that he fathered a daughter with a campaign videographer with whom he had an affair during his presidential campaign.
 BEHIND THE NEWS Mr. Edwards had long denied he was the father and had initially denied the affair. His acknowledgment came on the eve of the publication of a tell-all book by a former aide. ''It was wrong for me to ever deny she was my daughter,'' Mr. Edwards said. A spokeswoman could not confirm reports that Mr. Edwards has separated from his wife, Elizabeth, who is suffering from incurable breast cancer.

HEADLINE: At Sundance, New Routes To Finding an Audience

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

DATELINE: PARK CITY, Utah 

 BODY:
The starkest picture to emerge from the opening days of this year's Sundance Film Festival may be of an independent film business forced to stretch in untested directions because its old distribution model no longer works.
 Standard operating procedure over the years at Sundance, the cinematic bazaar now under way in this resort town, has been simple: show your film and hope it plays well enough to attract a theatrical distributor or, if the movie is particularly small and arty, a video-on-demand deal. 
 If no deal happens -- and this is where more than 75 percent of Sundance offerings landed last year -- you go home and try Internet downloads, DVD and foreign television sales. 
 But even that risky blueprint is being redrafted. With more art-house theaters closing and most of the big studios no longer interested in distributing specialty films, a theatrical release is becoming increasingly hard to secure. So some filmmakers are trying to turn that system on its head, using Sundance not just as a sales tool but also as a platform for immediate digital delivery.
 ''We just want to encourage people to throw the traditional model out the window,'' said Michael Mohan, the writer-director of ''One Too Many Mornings,'' a coming-of-age comedy that had its premiere here on Friday.
 Simultaneously, Mr. Mohan let users at OneTooManyMornings.com download the movie for $10 and started selling DVDs for $20. For $35, customers get a DVD, a poster and a piece of the sofa featured in the film. Mr. Mohan is also selling the theatrical rights via the Web site for $100,000. ''Forget a bidding war,'' he said. ''Whoever gets to their laptop the fastest gets it.''
 YouTube introduced its long-awaited movie rental option at this year's festival by offering five Sundance films as soon as they had their premieres. The rentals -- including ''One Too Many Mornings'' and ''Bass Ackwards,'' another film that bypassed the theatrical window -- will cost $3.99.
 And for the first time, Sundance will make films available in about 40 million homes through cable and satellite on-demand services simultaneously with premieres. The program, Sundance Selects, includes ''Daddy Longlegs,'' about being torn between adulthood and childhood.
 ''We are on a march to make more of this occur,'' said Joshua Sapan, chief executive of Rainbow Media, the subsidiary of Cablevision that owns the Sundance Channel, AMC and IFC Entertainment.
 As expected in this economy, deals at the festival have been slow to take off. But distributors started to nibble over the weekend, particularly on films like ''Catfish,'' an unconventional documentary about a photographer who is drawn into a mystery through Facebook. Also winning sales attention was ''Tucker & Dale vs. Evil,'' a Canadian comedy about college students who mistake a pair of backwoods rustics for psychotic killers.
 Mr. Sapan, who helped create Sundance Selects, called the traditional distribution system for indie films ''completely restrictive and choking'' and said digital technologies -- like his own company's video-on-demand business -- would continue to ''dramatically increase the footprint of availability for these films.''
 For filmmakers, the hope is broader than making some fast money by tapping into Sundance's publicity wave. Perhaps one of these movies will catch fire with indie fans and theatrical distributors will come calling. 
 ''There's no reason it can't go to theaters after it's already available online; they are two different groups of people,'' Mr. Mohan said. ''I know a lot of theater owners aren't into it, but maybe somebody out there is that progressive.''
 Of course, it is easy for him to take a nontraditional approach. He made ''One Too Many Mornings'' for just $50,000. While on-demand services and Web sales are becoming a substantial revenue stream, more expensive specialty endeavors continue to need theatrical distribution to have any hope of turning a profit.
 Failure to reach theaters would be a big problem for a film like ''Blue Valentine,'' a $5 million drama that had its premiere on Sunday and stars Michelle Williams and Ryan Gosling. ''If you've made a movie for $5 million and you're only doing a video-on-demand deal, your investors are getting killed,'' said Jay Cohen, head of film financing at the Gersh Agency, a Hollywood talent agency. (Luckily for the producers behind ''Blue Valentine,'' it is one of the festival's hottest acquisition targets.)
 At some point, however, anything is better than nothing. By Mr. Sapan's estimation, the average production cost of a feature film submitted to Sundance is roughly $1 million, which would put the total cost of films submitted this year at about $3.7 billion. Only about $120 million worth make the schedule, and of those less than $30 million worth will find their way to market through the traditional system.
 ''It's so competitive that specialty filmmakers really have to put their distribution caps on before they even start to shoot,'' said Reed Martin, the author of ''The Reel Truth,'' a guide to independent production.
 Specialty filmmakers are increasingly turning to companies like 42West, a public relations firm in New York, to help them navigate. ''To optimize Sundance as a theatrical release, marketing prior to the festival is crucial,'' said Amanda Lundberg, a 42West partner. 
 Perhaps this is the biggest question: if Sundance is a laboratory for the broader movie business, is mixing up the distribution cycle also the future for more mainstream releases?
 ''It probably does send Hollywood some signals,'' Mr. Sapan said. ''But remember that most of this material we are talking about -- specialty film -- doesn't have broad commerciality as a goal.''

HEADLINE: Retirees at the Mercy of the Bankers

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''How Retirees Saved the Banks'' (editorial, Jan. 18):
 Kudos to the editors for highlighting the ramifications of low interest rates. Yes, retirees have, through a laudable concern with safety, enabled the banks to obtain cheap money at the expense of not only the elderly but also of those who are starting their nest eggs.
 Are there larger issues here that need to be addressed? For example: Is the spread of bank interest rates and mortgage rates unduly wide? Are we shoring up the stock market by fostering unhealthy choices? What will be the future incentives to save? How sure are we that low interest rates always help business and in turn the economy? How much regulation is advisable? 
 Your editors should be applauded for finally bringing this well-kept secret out of the closet.
 E. Ward Herlands Stamford, Conn., Jan. 18, 2010
 To the Editor:
 A huge thank-you for airing this largely ignored problem. 
 I'm one of those innumerable seniors who depended heavily on income from investments in order to supplement Social Security, which, by itself, does not cover half of my necessary expenses. There will be no surprise estates left me, no earnings to supplement what I may lose. Thus, I have had no choice but the safest investments: CDs, T-bills and municipal bonds. 
 I cannot afford to lose any of the money I have left. Yet I am losing every day. The inflation I'm told does not exist clearly does. Inflation not only exists, but it's also eroding what resources we have. And not unlike legions of seniors, I have had no choice but to spend capital. There are no notches left on my belt.
 Last year, my total income from T-bills, one-third of my investments, was $19.
 There will be new hordes of homeless, needy people if the scales continue to swing in favor of wealthy, large institutions. I'm looking at an economy of smoke and mirrors, and through the smoke, it's my face that I see in the mirror.
 Mae B. Haynes Wayzata, Minn., Jan. 18, 2010
 To the Editor:
 I'm not just ''a retiree who relies on interest income''; I'm a retiree looking for something more than nominal interest.
 Pardon me for asking a simple question: Why are the executive ranks of the banks that are holding and using our money preparing to receive bonuses well over 100 percent of their salaries, but can't pay depositors 2 or 3 percent additional interest?
 Ed Jaworski Brooklyn, Jan. 18, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Your editorial is a long-overdue recognition of the vital fact that our loss of income has not been mentioned by any media in the great euphoria of cheap mortgages, multiple refinancing and the housing market bubble.
 It has been a singular mistake to deprive old people -- who are the one segment of the population normally able to spend money (having paid off their homes, sent their offspring to college and prudently saved for their old age) -- to the point of needing food stamps and charity when they could have afforded purchases to stimulate the economy.
 Retirees used to travel (using gasoline, hotels, tourism attractions), go on cruises, modernize their homes, buy appliances and eat out. So far, no chamber of commerce or advertising firm has ''connected the dots'' why spending is down in these categories.
 We can thank Ronald Reagan for the rise in interest rates that turned our small I.R.A. savings into sizable retirement cushions and stimulated the economy, to say nothing of a sense of security that reduced stress and its physical and social consequences. 
 It has been Alan Greenspan's and the past administration's concern for the rich to get richer that now have made senior citizens pay for the banks' billions held for the bonuses of their officers.
 Eva B. Neisser Vineland, N.J., Jan. 18, 2010
 To the Editor:
 ''How Retirees Saved the Banks'' correctly notes that with near-zero borrowing rates, banks can make money, with little or no risk and without lending to consumers and businesses, by buying Treasuries and high-grade corporate bonds, and that, while this is good for the health of the banks, it does little if anything for savers. 
 President Obama rightly wants to tax banks at the point where they engage in the kind of risky endeavors that created the financial crisis. But this would address just half the problem because taxing to disincentivize risky behavior does nothing to incentivize what is needed from the banks to bring about a robust recovery -- namely, more lending to consumers and businesses. 
 So if banks were taxed on returns from their ''investments'' in Treasuries and other bonds at a significantly higher rate than returns from real lending to consumers and businesses, such real lending would begin in earnest and the economic recovery would accelerate and strengthen. 
 In short, then, deterring risky conduct and having healthy banks is good, but adding an incentive tax to promote productive conduct and commerce would be even better.
 Eugene D. Cohen Phoenix, Jan. 18, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Along with saving the banks by leaving money on deposit at low rates, retirees also made it easy for traders to earn large bonuses.
 The bonuses this year were earned by traders who borrowed virtually free money and invested it with the assurance from the leaders of the Federal Reserve that short-term rates would not go up. This is why a one-time tax on bonuses is warranted.
 Instead of using all of the free money to support lending and strengthen their balance sheets, Wall Streeters used much of it to pay themselves bonuses under the false claim that they earned it. Hypocrites without shame.
 Joe Messinger Cedarburg, Wis., Jan. 18, 2010

HEADLINE: An Unofficial Candidate, on the Trail

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO

DATELINE: BUFFALO 

 BODY:
Harold E. Ford Jr. does not so much enter a restaurant as attack it. His eyes dart around the room as he figures out where to start. He systematically introduces himself to everyone: the waiters, the busboys, and then, the diners. 
 ''Hi, I'm Harold Ford,'' he said Sunday at Gigi's, a soul food restaurant here, extending a hand across the table. Some recognize him from his appearances as a political commentator for NBC, and seem eager to talk; others shoot him befuddled, slightly embarrassed looks. In a disarming gesture, he asks a patron's name, and then repeats it back. ''Where you from?'' he inquires. 
 He lightly rubs a back. He firmly clasps an elbow. He goes down on one knee to talk at eye level.
 Mr. Ford, a five-term congressman from Tennessee, has given himself until the end of February to decide whether to challenge Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand in New York's Democratic primary, but in the first week of a statewide tour, he is quickly revealing what kind of candidate he would be: an effortless retail politician, equally at ease in baroque restaurants and Baptist churches, who makes instant, Clinton-like connections with voters. 
 His travel schedule -- he will be in Albany on Monday, Westchester County on Thursday and Long Island next week -- is the latest indication of how seriously Mr. Ford is mulling a run. Friends who have spoken with him in recent days said that he was more likely than not to enter the race, and that they expected a decision well before his self-imposed deadline. 
 He has done little to tamp down such speculation. He has taken a 30-day leave of absence from his job at Bank of America; reserved several campaign Web sites, like FordforNewYork.com; and is in discussions about setting up an exploratory committee that would allow him to raise money while he is deciding. 
 ''I put it at 80 percent,'' said a close supporter who spoke with him during the past week; he cautioned that Mr. Ford's mind was not made up. 
 As he crisscrosses the state, advisers say that Mr. Ford's personable approach and commanding presence have emerged as his biggest assets. On Sunday morning, he attended services at the Greater Refuge Temple of Christ here. As usual, he spoke with no prepared remarks, recited Scripture (II Chronicles 7:14) and recalled a childhood in Memphis in which Sunday services were obligatory. ''If you ate breakfast,'' he said, ''you went to church.'' 
 After services, he spent 30 minutes greeting parishioners, lingering unhurried in the pews. ''Hey, baby,'' he said to an elderly woman, who smiled broadly, and leaned in for a peck on the check. 
 Savannah Farmer, after chatting with Mr. Ford outside the church about their shared roots in Memphis, called him ''wonderful.'' She added, without hesitation, ''If he runs, he has my vote.''
 Mr. Ford, 39, seems to relish the chitchat with his potential constituents -- and the airing of grievances -- that many fellow politicians merely tolerate. At the State Line restaurant, in Tappan, N.Y., the other day, he invited himself into a booth occupied by two middle-aged women and plunged into a debate about the lessons of the Massachusetts Senate race, where a seemingly safe Democratic seat was lost to a Republican, Scott Brown. 
 ''It's a serious wake-up call,'' said one woman. ''You're being kind,'' Mr. Ford shot back. ''I think it's a very serious wake-up call.'' 
 ''Where I was born,'' he continued, ''people viewed Massachusetts as the cradle of Democratic politics and liberalism.''
 One of the women pointedly asked Mr. Ford how he would ''avoid the carpetbagger issue.'' Mr. Ford smiled. ''I am just going to answer it head on,'' he said.
 ''Do you mind us asking these questions?'' the woman said, a little sheepishly. ''No, I love it,'' he said. ''You should ask whatever you want.''
 The women declared themselves charmed by the encounter. 
 But skepticism remains. In the Buffalo area, where the unemployment rate of 8.5 percent is the highest in 20 years, the patrons at Gigi's said they had met too many politicians who pass through town during campaigns, only to ignore the city once in office. 
 ''Make sure you come back here,'' said Lesile Smith, 49, who was laid off from her job at a bank, and gave Mr. Ford an earful about the difficulties of securing government assistance. 
 Mr. Ford told Ms. Smith and her friends that he would push for a payroll tax break that would encourage hiring at restaurants like Gigi's, by pumping money back into local communities. If he runs for Senate, and she is still unemployed, he told Ms. Smith, he would try to hire her to work in his upstate office. 
 Mr. Ford's amiable, everyman style, however organic, has a strategic value: It is likely to help burnish his image as an outsider who is taking on the Democratic establishment -- the same approach that Mr. Brown successfully used in Massachusetts, where he traveled across the state in a pickup truck. 
 Mr. Ford has already lashed out at ''party bosses'' who, he says, are trying to protect Ms. Gillibrand from a challenge, and has latched on to the language Mr. Brown used to describe a post in the Senate as ''the people's seat.'' 
 In his 2006 campaign for Senate from Tennessee, Mr. Ford left little of the state untouched, which his advisers cited as one reason he exceeded expectations, even though he lost by a slim margin. His aides in New York are hoping the same approach works here.
 ''I am a little old-fashioned in politics,'' he said on Sunday, after a meeting with the mayor of Buffalo, Byron W. Brown. ''I think it's important to let the real political strategists, the voters, give me some sense of what they are thinking and what their needs are, and for them to give you a sense of whether they want your kind of leadership.''
 ''As you can tell,'' he added, ''I kind of like shaking hands and listening to people.''

HEADLINE: Rivalries as Keen as on the Field

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
THERE is nothing like the big matchups at the Super Bowl as powerhouse players go head to head. For Madison Avenue, those fascinating face-offs have nothing to do with football; they pit marketers against one another in competitive categories like automobiles, credit cards, fast food and online services.
 Among the best confrontations have been those between the job-search Web sites. In the dawn of the dot-com era, Monster.com met HotJobs.com on the virtual gridiron. After HotJobs.com was acquired by Yahoo, Monster.com tackled CareerBuilder.com. 
 Both are back for Super Bowl XLIV on Feb. 7, buying commercial time from CBS on what is the biggest day of the year for advertising as well as football. CareerBuilder will make its sixth appearance on Super Bowl Sunday, with a spot scheduled for the second quarter that is to be based on an idea submitted by a consumer in a contest called Hire My TV Ad.
 Monster, owned by Monster Worldwide, is turning to professionals for its commercial, scheduled to run in the first quarter. The spot, featuring a beaver with a musical talent, was created by BBDO New York, part of the BBDO Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group. 
 The spot is part of a new campaign for Monster that carries the theme ''Get a Monster advantage,'' which replaces a theme, ''Your calling is calling,'' used for the last two years.
 The Super Bowl commercial will be the second spot in the new campaign. The first one appeared on Sunday during the American Football Conference championship game.
 Advertising during the football season's biggest game is expensive; for instance, CBS is charging an estimated average of $2.4 million to $2.8 million for each 30-second spot during the Super Bowl.
 But such sums are worth spending ''to make the biggest impact possible at this incredibly important time'' for job seekers, said John Osborn, president and chief executive at BBDO New York.
 The first new Monster.com spot told the tale of an incompetent boogeyman who is terrible at what he does. He searches Monster.com and lands his dream job -- as an accountant. The spot is being followed on Monday with elements like newspaper and online advertisements. 
 Using humorous characters like the boogeyman and the beaver reflects the results of research about the national mood, said Ted Gilvar, executive vice president and chief global marketing officer at Monster in New York.
 ''A year ago, people were down and out,'' Mr. Gilvar said, ''so we made sure people understood we felt their pain'' with a commercial from BBDO New York during Super Bowl XLIII in February 2009. That commercial showed a boss in a luxurious office seated under a moose head -- and his put-upon employee on the other side of the wall, sharing a drab office with the other end of the moose.
 ''This year people tell us they're tired of the bad news, and they're more optimistic,'' Mr. Gilvar said. ''They want two things: They want help and they want hope.''
 Of course, an unemployment rate of 10 percent can scare even a competent boogeyman. Although ''we can't create jobs,'' Mr. Gilvar acknowledged, ''we've spent two and a half years recreating and reinventing the content on our site.''
 One new feature on Monster.com is a semantic search engine named 6Sense, intended to make it easier for both job seekers to find relevant openings and employers to match job seekers to open posts. There are also new career-planning tools and a collection of 17 career communities where job seekers can form a network in fields like accounting, law enforcement, media and nursing.
 ''People are more and more frustrated over not getting the help they need'' to find work, Mr. Gilvar said. '' 'Get a Monster advantage' says we've got the tools that can help.''
 Most of the spending for the campaign will be for digital work like banner ads with embedded video clips and a special Web site where visitors can create music videos with the beaver from the Super Bowl spot. 
 There will also be direct mail, a presence for Monster.com on Facebook and Twitter, and e-mail marketing.
 Mr. Gilvar and Mr. Osborn declined to specify spending for the campaign. Mr. Gilvar said the company's ad budget would be ''essentially flat to year-ago'' with a focus as usual in the first quarter, ''our largest quarter by far, when people's psyches are in a sense of renewal'' and the impulse for self-improvement extends to new jobs along with exercise regimens and diets.
 As the economy has soured, Monster.com -- which derives its revenue from companies seeking employees -- has reduced its ad spending, according to data from the TNS Media Intelligence unit of WPP.
 Monster.com spent $66.2 million to advertise in major media in 2008, the data showed, down 28.5 percent, from $92.6 million in 2007. For 2009, TNS has data through the first nine months; in that time, spending totaled $31.7 million, down 48.6 percent, from $61.6 million in the same period in 2008.
 These are among the other category wars to be waged during Super Bowl XLIV, with the sponsors that have been identified to date:
 Automobiles. Audi, Dodge, Honda, Hyundai, Kia and Volkswagen.
 Movies. Paramount, Universal and Walt Disney.
 Restaurants. Denny's and Taco Bell.
 Snacks. Doritos, a Mars candy brand and Pop-Secret popcorn.
 Soft drinks. Coca-Cola and Dr Pepper Cherry.

HEADLINE: U.N. Aide Seeks Revision Of Terrorist List for Talks

BYLINE: By DEXTER FILKINS; Sangar Rahmi contributed reporting.

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan 

 BODY:
The leader of the United Nations mission here called on Afghan officials to seek the removal of at least some senior Taliban leaders from the United Nations' list of terrorists, as a first step toward opening direct negotiations with the insurgent group.
 In an interview, Kai Eide, the United Nations special representative, also implored the American military to speed its review of the roughly 750 detainees in its military prisons here -- another principal grievance of Taliban leaders. Until recently, the Americans were holding those prisoners at a makeshift detention center at Bagram Air Base and refusing to release their names.
 Together, Mr. Eide said he hoped that the two steps would eventually open the way to face-to-face talks between Afghan officials and Taliban leaders, many of whom are hiding in Pakistan. The two sides have been at an impasse for years over almost every fundamental issue, including the issue of talking itself. 
 ''If you want relevant results, then you have to talk to the relevant person in authority,'' Mr. Eide said. ''I think the time has come to do it.'' 
 In recent days, Afghan and American officials have signaled their willingness to take some steps that might ultimately lead to direct negotiations, including striking the names of some Taliban leaders from the terrorist list, as Mr. Eide is suggesting.
 The remarks by Mr. Eide were the latest in a series of Afghan and Western efforts to engage the Taliban movement with diplomatic and political means, even as a new American-led military effort was under way here. 
 American, Afghan and NATO leaders are also preparing to start an ambitious program to persuade rank-and-file Taliban fighters to give up in exchange for schooling and jobs. That plan, expected to cost hundreds of millions of dollars, will be the focus of an international conference this week in London.
 The plan aims at the bottom of the Taliban hierarchy -- the foot soldiers who are widely perceived as mostly poor, illiterate, and susceptible to promises of money and jobs. In 2007 and 2008, a similar effort unfolded in Iraq, where some 30,000 members of the country's Sunni minority -- many of them former insurgents -- were put on the American payroll. Partly as a result, violence there plummeted.
 Mr. Eide, who will leave his post in March, said that such efforts at reintegration would be useful but not enough. While some rank-and-file Taliban soldiers might be fighting for economic reasons, he said, the motives of most were more complex. The Taliban's leaders exert more control over the foot soldiers than they are given credit for, he said. 
 ''I don't believe it's as simple as saying that these are people who are unemployed, and if we find them employment they will go our way,'' Mr. Eide said. ''Reintegration by itself is not enough.''
 In the past, talks between the Afghan government and the insurgents have foundered on a few core issues. Afghan leaders have demanded that the Taliban forswear violence and their association with Al Qaeda before talks can begin. For their part, the Taliban have demanded that the Americans and other foreign forces leave the country first.
 But some Taliban leaders have indicated that they might be willing to engage in some sort of discussions if their names were stricken from the United Nations' so-called ''black list.'' The list contains the names of 144 Taliban leaders, including Mullah Mohammad Omar, the movement's leader, as well as 257 from Al Qaeda. Under United Nations Resolution 1267, governments are obliged to freeze the bank accounts of those on the list and to prevent them from traveling.
 Some Taliban leaders say the black list prevents them from entering into negotiations -- if they show their face, they say, they would be arrested.
 ''This would allow the Taliban to appear in public,'' said Arsalan Rahmani, a former deputy minister with the Taliban who now lives in the Afghan capital, Kabul. ''It would allow the possibility of starting negotiations in a third country.''
 Mr. Eide said he did not believe that senior Taliban leaders like Mullah Omar should be removed from the list. It was Mullah Omar, after all, who provided sanctuary to Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda, which launched the Sept. 11 attacks.
 But some second-tier Taliban should be taken from the list, he said. Those leaders are not necessarily associated with terrorist acts but might be able to speak for the movement, he said, and might be willing to reciprocate a good-will gesture. 
 The request to strike any Taliban names from the United Nations list would have to made by the Afghan government. In the past, Afghan officials have indicated that they might be willing to take some names off -- even that of Mullah Omar. But they have kept details and their ultimate intentions under wraps.
 Last week, the American envoy to the region signaled some willingness to allow the names of some Taliban to be taken off the list as long as they are not senior commanders responsible for atrocities or associated with Al Qaeda.
 ''A lot of the names don't mean much to me,'' Richard C. Holbrooke, the Obama administration's special envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan, said last week in Kabul. ''Some of the people on the list are dead, some shouldn't be on the list and some are among the most dangerous people in the world.
 ''I would be all in favor of looking at the list on a case-by-case basis to see if there are people on the list who are on the list by mistake and should be removed, or in fact are dead,'' he said.
 Mr. Holbrooke showed no willingness to ease up on the leaders of the insurgency, including Mullah Omar and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the leader of the Islamic Party, a group fighting the government and the Americans. ''I can't imagine what would justify such an action at this time,'' he said, ''and I don't know anyone who is suggesting that.''
 As for the Taliban prisoners, American officials say that they imposed a more rigorous review process several months ago, and that they are examining the case of each detainee. This month, after years of keeping the names of detainees secret, the American military released the names of 645 detainees being held in the main detention center outside of Kabul.
 Since September, when the new review process was imposed, the Americans have reviewed the cases of 576 detainees, and 66 of those have been released, Col. Stephen Clutter, a United States military spokesman, said. A review of all 645 detainees will be completed by the end of March, he added. Mr. Eide said he hoped it would go further.
 ''There needs to be a more comprehensive review of the list that has now been published,'' Mr. Eide said.
 Still, for all of that, it wasn't clear Sunday just how the Taliban would respond -- or if it would at all. 
 ''I don't know what they will do,'' Mr. Rahmani said.

PERSON: Robert A. Mosbacher 

HEADLINE: Robert A. Mosbacher, Commerce Chief And Texas Oil Wildcatter, Dies at 82

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

 BODY:
Robert A. Mosbacher, a native New Yorker whose swashbuckling career as a wildcatter in the oil fields of Texas and Louisiana paralleled and often intersected with that of President George H. W. Bush, whom he served as a fund-raiser, confidant, political adviser and secretary of commerce from 1989 to 1992, died at a Houston hospital on Sunday. He was 82 and lived in Houston. 
 The cause was pancreatic cancer, according to Jim McGrath, a family spokesman. A businessman and world-class sailor with polished political skills, Mr. Mosbacher made the most of his tenure at the Commerce Department, which had often suffered as a cabinet stepchild. He provided prominent support for American competitiveness in high technology, including HDTV, and won a role for the department in approving the export of technology with military applications, a function that had been the exclusive province of the State Department.
 He and his wife at the time, Georgette, a one-time model and cosmetics entrepreneur 20 years his junior, had entertained lavishly in Houston and New York but disappointed some Washington socialites with their more subdued social life in the capital. 
 In 1980, Mr. Mosbacher, serving as finance chairman in Mr. Bush's quest for the presidency, was one of two associates -- the other was James A. Baker III -- to advise Mr. Bush to quit the race to avoid jeopardizing his chance to become running mate to Ronald Reagan, the ultimate victor. Mr. Bush's vice presidency proved the springboard to his election as president in 1988.
 ''Without him, it's highly unlikely I would have ever been president of the United States,'' Mr. Bush wrote in a foreword to a draft of ''Going to Windward: A Mosbacher Family Memoir,'' a book by Mr. Mosbacher scheduled to be published in May.
 Mr. Mosbacher was the son of a Wall Street runner who later made a fortune as a specialist and trader on the Curb Exchange, the predecessor of the American Stock Exchange. As a teenager, he shuttled between the Choate School in Connecticut and the family's 43-acre estate in White Plains, where visitors included George Gershwin (who wrote ''Summertime'' there) and Ethel Merman.
 After graduating from Washington and Lee University in 1947 and working for a year with his father, who had oil investments in Texas, Mr. Mosbacher struck out on his own with the help of a parental grubstake of about $500,000. 
 ''I fell in love with Houston when I first arrived,'' he told The New York Times in 1975. ''I wanted to be a wildcatter. I wanted to live in the West or Southwest.''
 It took a few years of poring over land records in county courthouses before a debt-averse Mr. Mosbacher -- he said he had learned never to wildcat on capital or borrowed money -- drilled his first well. It turned out to be a dry hole.
 But in the mid-1950s he found a huge field of natural gas in south Texas and eventually drilled wells in Texas, Louisiana, Montana and western Canada. 
 He redeployed some of the family-owned Mosbacher Energy Company's assets into ranching, real estate and banking, diversifying a fortune that grew to an estimated hundreds of millions of dollars. 
 It was at a barbecue in Texas that Mr. Mosbacher met George H. W. Bush; the two shared a background as ambitious scions of wealthy and accomplished Northeastern families.
 With business success came an increasing role in politics, first by raising money for two failed Bush campaigns for the United States Senate that bracketed a successful one in 1966 for the House. In the 1970s, he served as finance chairman for President Gerald R. Ford. In 1988, he presided over a fund-raising effort that yielded an estimated $75 million and helped propel Mr. Bush into the White House. 
 Appointed to head the Commerce Department, Mr. Mosbacher said he aimed to develop closer ties between government and industry, perhaps, he hoped, with the aid of relaxed antitrust laws, so that United States factories could better compete in high technology. 
 He also complained publicly that hundreds of campaign contributors had been denied ambassadorships and other federal posts that he thought they deserved. 
 ''There's this perception,'' he told The Times, ''that fund-raisers are nice, interesting people to be sort of patted on the head when you need them and ignored the rest of the time because they don't really understand the process.''
 Away from government, Mr. Mosbacher was an accomplished sailor, though he was eclipsed on the water by his elder brother, Emil Mosbacher Jr., known as Bus, who served as State Department chief of protocol in the Nixon administration. Still, Robert Mosbacher won the 1958 Clifford D. Mallory Cup, the men's North American championship, as well as world sailing championships in the dragon class in 1969 and the soling class in 1971.
 Mr. Mosbacher married his first wife, the former Jane Pennybacker, by eloping when he was 19; he didn't tell his family for six months. He adopted her religion, saying in his memoir, ''My religion is Presbyterian, my heritage is Jewish -- and I am proud of that.'' She died in 1970.
 They had three daughters -- Diane, known as Dee, Kathryn and Lisa -- and a son, Robert Jr., who succeeded his father as head of Mosbacher Energy and who led the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, a federal agency, in the administration of George W. Bush. The children survive him, as do six grandchildren and one step-grandchild.
 Mr. Mosbacher is also survived by his fourth wife, Michele McCutchen, a Houston writer known as Mica whom he married in 2000. 
 His marriage to Sandra Smith Gerry ended in divorce in 1982. In 1984 he married Georgette Paulsin, herself twice previously married, who three years later paid $31 million for a Swiss maker of high-end beauty products called La Prairie.
 They divorced in 1998; after she wrote about their relationship in a book, ''It Takes Money, Honey,'' Mr. Mosbacher said the split had resulted mainly from disagreement over where to live, he wishing to spend most of his time in Houston, she in New York City.
 Mr. Mosbacher's memoir makes it clear that a major regret was his failure as commerce secretary to persuade the administration in the autumn of 1991 that it needed to act aggressively to spur a sluggish economy and counter damaging political accusations that the Bush White House was out of touch with the concerns of ordinary Americans.
 ''I pushed so hard on several different instances that fall I am sure people wonder why I wasn't fired -- including me,'' Mr. Mosbacher wrote. 
 Mr. Mosbacher finally persuaded a reluctant president to make a speech proposing a capital gains tax cut and allowing first-time home buyers to tap individual retirement accounts, but the resignation of John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, and attendant turmoil smothered any momentum. 
 ''Looking back now,'' Mr. Mosbacher wrote, ''I am convinced that those missteps in 1991 directly contributed to the administration's defeat a year later.''

HEADLINE: Liberal Radio, Even Without Air America

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

 BODY:
In a week of bad news for liberal causes, the announcement that Air America, the left-wing talk-radio network, was abruptly closing was greeted this way by Markos Moulitsas, founder of the Daily Kos political blog, when he asked on Twitter, ''Air America was still really on the air?'' 
 The collapse of Air America on Thursday came across as a symbolic loss for those seeking an ideological counterweight to right-wing talk radio dominated by personalities like Rush Limbaugh. But symbolic it is, little more, given that small pockets of progressive talk are flourishing on the radio dial despite Air America's misfortunes. The hosts of several progressive talk shows hastened to remind fans last week that although the format's brand-name network had folded, their shows were still on the air. 
 Air America's biggest names have been more successful after leaving the network. Rachel Maddow has a prime-time show on MSNBC, and Al Franken, the former comedian most closely associated with Air America, is a senator from Minnesota.
 Reminded of Ms. Maddow and Mr. Franken on Twitter Thursday evening, Mr. Moulitsas conceded, ''That's a pretty good legacy.'' But with so many defections and so few listeners, it is little wonder that people might think Air America had folded long ago. 
 The nearly six-year-old network, which suffered from merry-go-round management and repeated financial shortfalls, halted production on Thursday evening, only one hour after staff members were told they were losing their jobs. The network's signals will officially leave the airwaves on Monday. 
 Former hosts like Thom Hartmann credit Air America with promoting the notion that ''good talk radio can come from either side.'' Others note that the network caused some local stations to switch to left-wing talk, making more room for hosts like Ed Schultz and Stephanie Miller, who always remained independent of Air America. 
 Mr. Hartmann, who replaced Mr. Franken on Air America in 2007, is called the most important progressive host in the United States by Talkers Magazine. In an interview he said he found Air America to be ''spectacularly incompetent'' at running a radio network and gaining an audience, and left Air America last year for a lesser-known syndication company. ''We've been far more successful since we left,'' he said.
 In interviews last week a half-dozen former Air America employees cited similar complaints, namely that a series of owners and managers lacked the necessary broadcasting business expertise. They spoke to what may be Air America's other enduring legacy: that political media from either side of the aisle is more successful when run as a business rather than as a crusade. 
 Air America's problem, said Michael Harrison, editor of Talkers Magazine, was not knowing ''whether they were a political campaign or a broadcasting company.''
 ''They ended up not being terribly good at either,'' Mr. Harrison added.
 What Air America peddled was a collection of shows that it syndicated to local stations. At the outset some stations, like KKGN-AM, Green 960 in the San Francisco Bay area, carried virtually all of the programming. But ''it was a mess from almost the get-go,'' KKGN's program director, John Scott, wrote in a letter to listeners on the station's Web site, green960.com. He cited ''management screw ups'' and overspending among the reasons, and asserted that talk radio has to be entertaining, not strictly political.
 In its most recent incarnation, Air America had reimagined itself as a multimedia venture with a new Web site and hosts like Montel Williams, but that was not enough. Charlie Kireker, the chairman of Air America Media, cited the poor economy as a reason for the closing in a letter to employees on Thursday. The company had been seeking new investors up until last week. 
 Some conservatives have reveled in the network's failure. The Fox News commentator Bill O'Reilly cited Air America's demise to cheer on ''the collapse of the far-left media'' and to claim that the United States is ''moving to the right, very quickly.'' Even the biggest proponents of progressive talk admit that they have no Rush Limbaugh or Sean Hannity equivalent.
 The disparity goes back to the conservatives' ''20-year head start'' on powerful radio stations, Mr. Hartmann said. 
 Ron Hartenbaum, the manager for Mr. Hartmann, Ms. Miller and other hosts, said that the disparity also illustrated how radio stations were ''conservatively run'' by agenda-driven and risk-averse owners. 
 Other factors include listener preferences, the demographics of talk-radio listeners and the various options on the dial, like National Public Radio.
 But a number of progressive hosts have managed to stand out in recent years, thanks partly to the boost that Air America gave to the format. Mr. Hartenbaum said that the format was ''more stable and healthier than it has ever been.'' 
 The Air America alum Mike Malloy, for one, picked up new stations last week because some former Air America affiliates needed programming to fill their schedules.
 Among other former Air America personnel, Randi Rhodes, who brought her program to Air America at its founding, left it in 2008 and moved last year to Clear Channel's Premiere Radio Networks, also home to Mr. Limbaugh and a bastion of other conservative talkers. 
 With the exits of Ms. Maddow, Mr. Hartmann, Ms. Rhodes and others, Air America saw its market share diminish. 
 On the Web site of the progressive station KPTK in Seattle, am1090seattle.com, for instance, listeners were assured that ''most of your favorite shows come from variety of sources,'' meaning that the Air America closing had minimal impact. KPTK's only weekday program still provided by Air America -- ''The Ron Reagan Show,'' hosted in the evenings by the son of the former president -- will remain on the air.

HEADLINE: In a Company's Hometown, The Emptiness Echoes

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY

DATELINE: DAYTON, Ohio 

 BODY:
 Every 15 minutes the chiming bells of the Deeds Carillon mark time's passage in Dayton. Their ever-repeating song reminds the city of its deep connection to the NCR Corporation, formerly known as National Cash Register, for generations known here as The Cash.
 The carillon, a 151-foot tower of limestone and steel, was a gift from a former NCR chief executive and his wife. It sits beside a boulevard named after the eccentric man who founded NCR, not far from other NCR touchstones: an office building here, a former warehouse there, and acres and acres of land.
 As those bells tolled one day last June, the company, which specializes in automated teller machines and other self-service devices, announced a ''major investment in innovation and people,'' though not the people of Dayton. NCR stunned the city of its birth with the news that it was moving its world headquarters to suburban Atlanta.
 The decision broke a bond dating to 1884, when John H. Patterson began a cash register company here. That bond tightened as Patterson developed a reputation for ruthless dismissals and eccentric benevolence (having employees weighed, for example, to monitor their health); as NCR helped save Dayton from the great flood of 1913; as technological advances and missed opportunities led to gleeful expansion and painful reduction. 
 It's all just history now, a stipulation in a contentious divorce. 
 The company said its public goodbye from the safety of 500 miles, in Atlanta, where Bill Nuti, the NCR chief executive, and Gov. Sonny Perdue -- whose state had promised a lucrative incentive package -- posed for photographs. The images galled Dayton, given Ohio's contention that Mr. Nuti had sidestepped several invitations from its governor since 2007 to discuss NCR's needs and desires. 
 Simply put, said Lt. Gov. Lee Fisher, the company's behavior was ''shamefully irresponsible.''
 But Mr. Nuti said last week that Ohio had been given a fair chance -- or, perhaps, fair warning. He also noted that the NCR of today has 22,000 employees around the world, and that by the time of the break-up announcement it had more employees in Georgia than the 1,200 it had in Ohio. 
 As a result, Mr. Nuti said, the practicality of Dayton demanded a hard look. Transportation costs were high, and flights to and from the airport often required ''multiple hops'' for customers and employees. And attracting top talent was a struggle, he said. ''We had a very difficult time recruiting people to live and work in Dayton.''
 True, downtown Dayton is profoundly challenged. And true, its main airport simply cannot match Atlanta's vast offering of nonstop flights.
 But Dayton chafes at the backwater implication. The metropolitan region is expanding, the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base is booming, and the good quality of life might look even better from the rearview mirror of a car stuck in Atlanta traffic. 
 In addition, Dayton is within a 90-minute drive of Cincinnati and Columbus, the home of Ohio State University. To suggest that talent is not already here and cannot be attracted here is ''insulting,'' said Ellen Belcher, the editorial page editor of The Dayton Daily News.
 And by the way: Doesn't 125 years count for something?
 Mr. Fisher, who is running for the United States Senate, said NCR had a ''moral obligation'' to give its home state a fair chance. And once the company decided to relocate, he said, it had a second obligation to explain that decision to the people of Dayton -- ''to look them straight in the eye.''
 But it seems now that NCR began winking back in 2005, when its new C.E.O., Mr. Nuti, did not move to Dayton as was initially required by his contract. (''Serious family issues,'' he said.) While civic leaders did not expect Mr. Nuti to make the Monday meetings of the Rotary Club, they soon came to see him as a brash New Yorker harboring disdain for the modest Midwest.
 One example: NCR was a dues-paying member of the Dayton Development Coalition, a business-advocacy group, until Mr. Nuti took control. After that, Jim Leftwich, the coalition's upbeat president, said, ''It became difficult to reach out to them and hear back from them.''
 Another example: Mr. Fisher said that he and Gov. Ted Strickland have sought meetings with the chief executives of the state's top companies to encourage expansion and head off problems. Of the dozens he has dealt with, he said, only one never returned his calls: Mr. Nuti.
 Mr. Nuti countered that he had donated a ''substantial portion of personal money to Dayton charities.'' He also emphasized that he has responsibilities throughout the world, and does not ''involve myself in many, many locations.''
 Of course, pieces often come together after things fall apart. 
 In 2007, NCR opened executive offices in New York City, Mr. Nuti's home turf. In August 2008, as The Atlanta Journal-Constitution later reported, Mr. Nuti had a private half-hour meeting in Georgia with Governor Perdue, who presented him with a golf putter engraved with the state logo. 
 In February 2009, Lieutenant Governor Fisher and other Ohio leaders, fearing that NCR had become a ''flight risk,'' met with company executives at NCR headquarters. Mr. Fisher said the group could not get a straight answer about NCR's plans, and his repeated requests to meet with Mr. Nuti were denied. One NCR executive, he said, ''acted as if we had asked to meet with the emperor.''
 NCR officials said the meeting was about economic development in general. They also said that Mr. Nuti was waiting for the visitors, they were late, he had another meeting -- and, well, they just never connected.
 Jon Husted, an Ohio state senator, came away from the meeting feeling angry and frustrated. ''They already knew they were leaving,'' he said.
 Dayton is not alone in feeling slighted. Mr. Nuti said that he attended a renewable energy conference in New York the month after that disastrous meeting, and during lunch sat next to Governor Strickland -- who, he says, not only did not know who he was, despite his name tag, but never introduced himself.
 A spokeswoman for Mr. Strickland noted NCR's ''repeated ambivalence'' about meeting with the governor, and said he would have been happy to talk to Mr. Nuti about NCR's plans if he had been approached.
 In April, NCR officials said, they shared an independent analysis with Ohio delegates that strongly recommended relocation, and asked what the state would do to retain the company -- though, in retrospect, this did not afford Ohio much time. 
 In late May, state officials frantically tried to contact NCR about the growing rumors of the company's imminent departure; the answer was a telling silence. Ohio hurriedly offered an incentive package that was much less attractive than Georgia's, though Ohio officials say they could have matched the rival offer if given the chance.
 No matter; time was up. On June 1, Mr. Strickland and Mr. Nuti finally spoke -- by telephone, though -- and mostly so that NCR could say goodbye. 
 NCR is now settling its affairs. It is leaving its archives here, as well as a data center that some company workers will continue to run. But of the 1,200 employees who were here in June, more than half have retired, resigned or been released. The company will not say how many were offered jobs in Georgia, or how many accepted. 
 In addition, NCR sold its headquarters last month; the building will soon be home to the University of Dayton Research Institute. But there is nothing the company can do about theDeeds Carillon, or what thoughts are conjured by the song of its bells.

HEADLINE: Independent Group to Look at Ways to Reduce Debt

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Just as President Obama and Congressional Democrats are trying to create a bipartisan commission on reducing the debt, some well-known former elected officials and veterans of past administrations are announcing their own task force on Monday, underscoring the mounting concern over the nation's fiscal future.
 The timing of the group's formation is coincidental, organizers said. Yet the outside group, including prominent Democrats and Republicans, could provide pressure and political cover for the parallel effort by the administration and Congressional leaders to consider both unpopular spending cuts and tax increases. 
 The blue-ribbon group of 18 to 20 members will be led by Pete V. Domenici, a Republican former senator from New Mexico who for years was the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, and Alice Rivlin, a Democrat and former budget director for both Congress and President Bill Clinton who is also a former vice chairwoman of the Federal Reserve. 
 Their goal is to, by December, give Congress and Mr. Obama a multiyear plan to raise tax revenues and pare spending, especially for the Medicare and Medicaid programs, which are the biggest factors driving the projections of future high deficits, Mr. Domenici and Ms. Rivlin said in a joint interview. 
 That puts their task force on the same timetable as the commission that the president and senior lawmakers, including a few Republicans, are considering.
 The Senate is to vote Tuesday on bipartisan legislation that would create an 18-member commission, consisting mostly of lawmakers and administration officials, and would bind Congress to vote on its recommendations in December, after the midterm elections. 
 But the bill is expected to fail, despite Mr. Obama's endorsement on Saturday, because most Republicans say it would force higher taxes and some liberal Democrats oppose the prospect of cuts for entitlement programs.
 If the bill is defeated, Mr. Obama is poised to announce, perhaps in his State of the Union address on Wednesday, that he is establishing a bipartisan commission by executive order. While he could not require Congress to hold votes on any recommendations of a presidential commission, Democratic leaders have tentatively agreed that they would.
 House and Senate Republican leaders have indicated that they will not cooperate in any commission that considers raising taxes.
 ''Spending is the problem,'' Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate minority leader, said on the NBC program ''Meet the Press'' on Sunday. ''I do worry that if we construct this commission in the wrong way, it will be kind of an indirect way to raise taxes.'' And ''raising taxes in the middle of a recession is not a good idea,'' he added. 
 But Mr. Domenici said: ''We have to consider everything. We have to put taxes on the table.'' 
 Both he and Ms. Rivlin also emphasized that the task force would not be recommending spending cuts or tax increases that could undermine the economy's recovery and job creation. Instead, they said, it will propose long-range policy changes.
 Mr. Domenici said that some elected officials in his party mistakenly argue that ''Republicans shouldn't have to do this because Democrats accrued all the debt last year.'' In fact, most of the current $12 trillion debt results from policies adopted in the past decade when Republicans controlled the White House and Congress. 
 ''There is nothing good for America that will come out of arguing which part of the debt each party is responsible for,'' Mr. Domenici said. 
 The outside group is sponsored by the Bipartisan Policy Center, which was formed by four former Senate majority leaders -- Bob Dole and Howard Baker, Republicans, and Tom Daschle and George Mitchell, Democrats. Mr. Baker and Mr. Daschle will outline the task force on Monday.
 Other members will include two former governors, James J. Blanchard, Democrat of Michigan, and Frank Keating, Republican of Oklahoma.

HEADLINE: After Senate Race, Some Say Barrier for Women in Massachusetts Still Stands

BYLINE: By KATIE ZEZIMA

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
The defeat of Martha Coakley in last week's special election to fill the Senate seat that was long held by Edward M. Kennedy has reignited the debate over whether there is a glass ceiling for women in Massachusetts politics.
 ''Welcome to liberal Massachusetts -- we're not,'' said Mary Anne Marsh, a Democratic political consultant. ''And if you didn't believe it before, anyone who thinks that Massachusetts is liberal in light of Tuesday's results need only look at the record and lack of success women have had in Massachusetts politics. That should just put it away for good.'' 
 For decades, women have been unable to gain a solid political toehold in Massachusetts, a state long dominated by male political figures. Five women in Massachusetts's history -- including Ms. Coakley, the attorney general -- have been elected to statewide constitutional office, and four have been elected to the House of Representatives. 
 Currently, the only women to hold high elective office are Ms. Coakley, Representative Niki Tsongas and the State Senate president, Therese Murray. 
 ''Women in Massachusetts have had a hard time winning statewide office and holding it if they got it,'' said Dan Payne, a Democratic strategist. One reason, he said, is that there are not enough women running at lower political levels to move up.
 Ms. Murray, the first woman to be State Senate president and the 16th woman elected to the body since 1790, has been cultivating a network of politically involved women to run for local office or raise money for female candidates through forums and mentoring groups. And in Cambridge, the Barbara Lee Family Foundation analyzes the role of women in politics and writes guidebooks to help them get elected. 
 ''I think the guys have done a better job with having a pipeline and a team effort in the past,'' Ms. Murray said. ''We're in the process of making it strong for women, and we have to make it stronger.''
 But doing so has been particularly difficult. 
 ''Massachusetts is a place where there have been just a few groups that have defined the political field, and I've never heard of women being a concern,'' said Swanee Hunt, the founding director of the Women and Public Policy Program at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government and the United States ambassador to Austria from 1993 to 1997.
 ''For women to run, they have to break through the way things have been done,'' said Ms. Hunt, who is also the Eleanor Roosevelt Lecturer in Public Policy at the Kennedy School.
 Mr. Payne said he believed women had given Ms. Coakley a late push in her primary victory against three male opponents. But he said Ms. Coakley never mentioned her gender or that she would have been the state's first female United States senator, while Scott Brown, her opponent, ran ''a macho, testosterone campaign,'' driving around the state in a pickup. (No tallies of the vote by gender were available.) 
 Shannon O'Brien, a former state treasurer who lost to Mitt Romney in her 2002 bid to become governor, said many in Massachusetts and around the country still did not see women serving in boardrooms and executive suites or holding high political office. 
 ''When you close your eyes and think of a governor or a president, immediately a picture comes to mind -- for many people that is not a woman,'' Ms. O'Brien said. She said she remembered being judged harshly because of her gender, and recalled a man who wrote a letter criticizing her for having a baby while in office.
 ''There were reminders that you were perceived differently,'' Ms. O'Brien said. ''It's harder to hang on to those positive feelings people had once that doubt is planted. It's more difficult for women to recover. You have to work harder to credential yourself, and it's easier for women to lose support when negative attacks happen.'' 
 Kerry Healey, who served as lieutenant governor under Mr. Romney, won the Republican Party's nomination for governor in 2006 but lost the election to her opponent, Deval Patrick. 
 Ms. Healey said she found it more difficult to be a Republican than a woman in Massachusetts politics. But she added that the bruising political climate here made running for office less attractive to many women. 
 ''Politics in Massachusetts is a blood sport,'' she said, ''and that fact alone may deter many women who might consider seeking elected office in a milder political climate.'' 
 ''Women know that choosing a career in politics may damage their economic security, family or reputation,'' Ms. Healey said. ''Women need to be made more comfortable taking those risks.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: January 26, 2010

 CORRECTION:
An article on Monday about a debate in Massachusetts, following Martha Coakley's loss in last week's Senate race, over whether a glass ceiling exists there for women in politics, misstated, in some copies, the number of women that Massachusetts has sent to the United States House of Representatives through the years. There have been four, not three.

HEADLINE: For Top Economic Aides, A Shaky Week in Office

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
At a moment of financial peril in 1999, Time magazine's cover featured a Federal Reserve chairman and Treasury secretary under the headline: ''The Committee to Save the World.''
 In winter 2009, Ben S. Bernanke, the current Fed chairman, and Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, helped do just that, according to business leaders and officials from the wildly divergent administrations of Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama.
 Their reward: in different but equally embarrassing ways, each man last week became a casualty of the popular discontent terrifying political Washington. 
 Mr. Bernanke unexpectedly scraped for votes for confirmation to a second term. Mr. Geithner battled speculation about declining influence after Mr. Obama embraced new policies to restrain Wall Street. 
 Both appear set to survive. The White House reiterated confidence in Mr. Geithner, notwithstanding criticism from both ends of the political spectrum. And the Obama administration joined its most conspicuous adversaries -- leaders of the Republican Party and Wall Street -- in scrambling to rescue Mr. Bernanke.
 Such rare bipartisan teamwork shows that even broad populist anger has limited power. But as Mr. Obama prepares for the State of the Union address, neither he nor anyone in Washington can be confident of what those limits are, or when they will next be overrun.
 Ripples From a Defeat
 Both parties keep sifting for lessons from the stunning capture by Scott Brown, a Republican, of the Senate seat once held by Edward M. Kennedy. Massachusetts voters spoke more loudly than clearly.
 A poll by The Washington Post, the Harvard School of Public Health and the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation found that Tuesday's voters opposed the health care legislation in Washington 48 percent to 43 percent. But 68 percent backed the state's own system of near-universal coverage, whose core elements were the model for Mr. Obama and the Democrats.
 Mr. Brown tapped into national disapproval of swelling deficits. But he proposed tax cuts to reduce the 10 percent jobless rate -- the Republican flip side of Democratic spending to achieve the same goal.
 To some degree, his victory alarmed incumbents in both parties. But it panicked Congressional Democrats, who have long expected midterm election setbacks. 
 ''We knew this was going to be a bumpy ride,'' said Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, chairman the House Democrats' campaign committee. ''But I think one of the key lessons coming out of Massachusetts was, the message that we are moving forward on jobs and the economy has not broken through.''
 Complications for Mr. Geithner began developing late last year. Alarmed by persistently high unemployment, Mr. Obama publicly challenged bankers to increase lending and decrease resistance to new Wall Street regulations. Meanwhile, he directed Mr. Geithner and Lawrence H. Summers, the White House economic adviser, to incorporate additional regulations suggested by Paul A. Volcker, the former Fed chairman, that both officials had previously sidetracked.
 In an interview, Mr. Summers recalled ''very substantial discussions with Paul Volcker'' on his ideas for limiting the size and scope of financial firms to curb systemic risk. Mr. Obama and his advisers reached consensus on their approach last month.
 But the White House decision to unveil it with a rhetorical flourish less than 48 hours after Mr. Brown's victory gave the appearance of a drastic shift in tone and policy, undercutting Mr. Geithner's measured efforts to stabilize financial markets.
 It also fueled the brushfire heading toward Mr. Geithner's partner, Mr. Bernanke.
 White House Defense
 White House aides concluded that they had to douse that fire after the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, publicly equivocated on Mr. Bernanke, whose term expires Jan. 31. 
 The chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, upbraided Mr. Reid in a telephone call, saying the administration and sagging markets ''need something stronger from the Senate majority leader.'' A Reid aide noted that the call had included some of Mr. Emanuel's characteristic profanity. 
 By Friday afternoon, Mr. Reid had issued a statement backing the Fed chairman. Mr. Obama, Mr. Emanuel, Mr. Geithner and David Axelrod, a political adviser, leaned on others. 
 To solidify Republican support, the administration used backstage assistance from some of the very executives with whom Mr. Obama has been picking public fights, including members of the Financial Services Forum, a nonprofit policy group for major financial businesses. The investor Warren Buffett and Jeffrey R. Immelt, the chairman of General Electric, helped contact senators, a senior official said.
 Over the weekend, Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire, and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, all predicted Mr. Bernanke's confirmation. Thus a week of populist revolt ended with signs that Mr. Obama would retain, at least for now, his two highest-profile economic policy allies.
 ''Tim Geithner helped steer the financial sector and the entire economy through the worst crisis since the Great Depression,'' Mr. Emanuel said in an interview. ''He's not going anywhere.''

HEADLINE: Re-energized, G.O.P. Widens Midterm Effort

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY and CARL HULSE; Jeff Zeleny contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Republicans are luring new candidates into House and Senate races, and the number of seats up for grabs in November appears to be growing, setting up a midterm election likely to be harder fought than anyone anticipated before the party's big victory in Massachusetts last week.
 Republicans still face many obstacles, not least a number of potentially divisive primaries in coming months that will highlight the deep ideological rifts within the party. But in the days since Republicans claimed the Senate seat that Edward M. Kennedy had held for decades, upending assumptions in both parties about the political landscape for 2010, they have seen not just a jolt of energy and optimism but also more concrete opportunities to take on Democrats.
Just since Tuesday, half a dozen Republicans have expressed interest in challenging Democrats in House races in New York, Pennsylvania and potentially Massachusetts, party officials said. 
 ''I think it was inspiring and gave voice to a lot of people,'' said Mike Fitzpatrick, a former one-term Republican congressman from the Philadelphia suburbs who announced on Saturday that he would try to reclaim his old seat from Representative Patrick J. Murphy, a Democrat. 
 Representative John Boozman, Republican of Arkansas, said the results in Massachusetts had pushed him toward challenging Senator Blanche Lincoln, a vulnerable Democrat. ''If the people of Massachusetts are upset, you can imagine how the people of Arkansas feel,'' Mr. Boozman said in a telephone interview Sunday night.
 Republicans said they were soliciting high-profile candidates for Senate races in Indiana and Wisconsin, states they had been prepared to write off just weeks ago. Tommy G. Thompson, the former Wisconsin governor, is considering challenging Senator Russ Feingold, a Democrat, aides said. Even in longer-shot states like New York, Republicans said they think the political climate gives them a chance to find a strong Senate candidate. 
 ''If you live in a district with no Republican candidate, run for office,'' Representative Pete Sessions of Texas, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, wrote in a posting on RedState, a conservative blog.
 Stuart Rothenberg, a political analyst who follows Congressional races, said a report he will release Monday will count 58 Democratic House seats in play, up from 47 in December. The number of Republican seats in play has held at 14 in that period, he said. And Democrats expect more of their incumbents to retire, which could put additional seats at risk.
 Democratic officials said Sunday night that Representative Marion Berry of Arkansas was expected to announce plans to retire Monday, making him the first to quit since the Massachusetts election and opening up another competitive race.
 Republicans need a net gain of 40 seats to regain control of the House. That still seems unlikely, though hardly impossible.
 Mr. Rothenberg lists seven Democratic Senate seats and four Republican seats in play; that number will not change on Monday, though Mr. Rothenberg recently rated Republicans as likely to take over Mrs. Lincoln's seat in Arkansas.
 ''The Republicans are expanding the playing field, no doubt about that,'' Mr. Rothenberg said, describing it as a continuing Democratic deterioration that began late last summer.
 But the outlook for November remains hard to discern for several reasons. The Supreme Court decision last week overturning limits on corporate money in campaigns could alter races in ways difficult to predict, though the conventional wisdom is that Republicans will benefit most.
 President Obama and the Democrats are reorganizing to blunt any advantage Republicans might have gained from the burst of angry populism that seems to be coursing through both parties.
 The White House has not given up on passing a health care bill, and there is still time for the economy to improve in a way that could benefit the president and his party. And while Republicans are benefiting now from a wave of optimism, they also face a thicket of primary fights, starting in Illinois on Feb. 2, which could weaken their nominees.
 Democrats have not been spared primary battling. Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, who switched to the Democratic Party from the Republican last year, faces a primary challenge on the left from Representative Joe Sestak. The party also faces competitive Senate primaries in Colorado, Illinois, Kentucky, North Carolina and Ohio, reflecting, among other issues, strains between liberals and centrists.
 But the deeper intramural divisions are within the Republican Party, a sign of the intensity and unpredictability of the grass-roots conservative movement.
 Across the country, Republican candidates are running as outsiders with the backing of conservative Tea Party groups, challenging Republicans identified with the party establishment. Several analysts said the victory in the Massachusetts Senate race of Scott Brown, a Republican who ran with Tea Party support, could encourage more challenges and drive incumbents further right.
 Senator John McCain of Arizona, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee, is facing a primary challenge from former Representative J. D. Hayworth, who is seeking to exploit longstanding unease among conservatives toward Mr. McCain.
 Highly contested and potentially divisive Senate primaries are also shaping up in California, Colorado, Florida, Kentucky, Nevada and New Hampshire. 
 The Illinois primary next week is one example where a Senate candidate favored by the Republican establishment, Representative Mark Steven Kirk, has to deal with the complications of a challenge from the right. Mr. Kirk has veered right on issues like climate change, after originally voting for a Democratic bill on the subject in the House.
 In Kentucky, Trey Grayson, the secretary of state, faces a stiff challenge from Dr. Rand Paul, a Tea Party candidate and a son of Representative Ron Paul of Texas, a Republican presidential candidate in 2008. If Mr. Paul wins -- and early polling suggests he could -- a Democrat would be favored to win the seat, now held by Jim Bunning, a Republican who is not seeking re-election.
 The debate over whether the party needs to embrace conservative roots or broaden its appeal will continue this week in Honolulu, where the Republican National Committee is girding to address a so-called purity resolution introduced by conservative leaders. The resolution requires Republican candidates to support at least 8 of 10 conservative positions -- on issues including abortion, same-sex marriage and immigration -- or be cut off from party financing and support.
 Party officials said they were hopeful that they could head off the resolution, though probably not without a contentious debate.
 Republicans said that the glut of candidates was evidence of the party's robustness, and that primaries were as likely to be helpful as damaging to the party's hopes in November.
 ''There's a ton of primaries on the Republican side,'' said Curt Anderson, a senior adviser to Michael Steele, the chairman of the Republican National Committee. ''I have always been of the camp that that's a healthy thing. I know Democrats say: 'They are divided. They have primaries.' I'm like, throw me in the briar patch -- we have people who want to run for office.''
 Democrats have seized on this as evidence of the obstacles Republicans face. Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said that by his count, Republicans face robust primaries in at least 55 districts. ''The dynamic is to drive the winner way to the right,'' Mr. Van Hollen said, ''which does risk losing the moderate and independent vote.''
 Charlie Cook, an analyst of Congressional races, said these contested primaries could prove to be a plus for Republicans, in the form of increased contributions, volunteers and votes. But, Mr. Cook said, ''If it helps eccentric candidates who are not electable in a general election get the nomination, that's a problem, or if Tea Party candidates lose primaries and Tea Party supporters stay home, that's a problem.''

HEADLINE: A Playland for Apps In a Tablet World

BYLINE: By JENNA WORTHAM

 BODY:
Apple's move to open up the iPhone to outside programmers in 2008 started a software-writing frenzy. Giant companies and bedroom tinkerers alike rushed to get their applications into the App Store and onto the phone's 3.5-inch touch screen. 
 Now those developers are about to get a bigger stage -- or at least a bigger screen.
 The tablet computer that Apple is widely expected to introduce on Wednesday will run applications designed for the iPhone, judging from data that an app-tracking company is picking up from devices in use around Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, Calif.
 But the larger screen -- most likely 10 inches diagonally -- and other features of the tablet could inspire developers to create new twists on apps, like games that two or more people can easily play at once on the same device. 
 ''Given the success of the iPhone, developers are going to start devoting resources to developing for the bigger format,'' said Gene Munster, a senior research analyst at Piper Jaffray. ''The larger screen really plays to the imagination and clearly gives app developers a new kind of canvas.''
 Ge Wang, co-founder of Smule, the company behind applications like Ocarina and I Am T-Pain that turn the iPhone into a music machine, said he expected the tablet to be better than the iPhone at detecting the touch of many fingers. 
 ''On the iPhone, there are five touch points max,'' Mr. Wang said. ''You don't need much more than that because that's about all you can fit on that screen.'' 
 A tablet with a bigger and better multitouch screen, he said, ''could mean entirely new user interfaces, screen layouts, instruments, contraptions and games.'' Mr. Wang said his company was not working on anything specific for an Apple tablet but was eager to begin experimenting.
 Other developers of iPhone applications see the tablet as a way to grab a bigger share of the wider software market. Some analysts estimate that the App Store generates as much as $1 billion a year in revenue for Apple and its developers, and a larger device is likely to expand that pie.
 ''We are always competing with the television in the living room,'' said Bart Decrem, chief executive of Tapulous, a start-up in Silicon Valley that makes games and other applications for the iPhone and its phoneless cousin, the iPod Touch. ''We spend a lot of time battling with Rock Band, Guitar Hero and even YouTube for our users' time.''
 Tapulous says it is profitable, with rapid revenue growth from sales of its popular tap-to-the-music games. Its series of Tap Tap Revenge games have been downloaded more than 25 million times. ''A new form factor like a tablet that gets closer to a PC or a television screen could help get us more market share and mind share,'' Mr. Decrem said. 
 Tapulous will adapt its current lineup of applications for a tabletlike device, but will wait to see how well the tablet sells before pouring resources into developing new applications for it, Mr. Decrem added. The tablet is expected to go on sale in the spring, and it is not known what price Apple will set. 
 A few clues about what kinds of applications Apple employees are trying out on the tablet come from Flurry, a mobile analytics company that offers developers a free tool which gathers data about the use of their applications. With the data, Flurry can generate reports about the location of an application's users, for example, or how long it took a user to complete a game level. 
 Applications with the Flurry software built in also send a unique code identifying what kind of device they are running on. Flurry said its systems began detecting a new class of device last October. About 50 of the devices have been detected so far, most of them being used near Cupertino, said Peter Farago, vice president for marketing at Flurry. 
 ''We saw a lot of testing of applications that deal with daily media consumption, like news, books, streaming music and radio,'' Mr. Farago said. ''But we are also seeing so many social apps, like multiplayer games you can play with your friends.''
 While he said contractual obligations prevented him from naming specific applications, Mr. Farago said the data also showed ''a heavy emphasis on what people can do during those in-between moments and while in transit'' -- using apps for finding restaurants or keeping shopping lists, for example.
 Laura DiDio, an independent wireless analyst who keeps a close eye on Apple, said she expected the tablet to demonstrate some innovation in navigation and weather forecasts. She said she also expected to see apps that used the tablet as a teaching tool and allowed people to hold a videoconference while sharing media. 
 There are indications that Apple may want the tablet to run some business-oriented applications that require complex interactions with the screen. A former Apple designer has said programmers at the company were developing a multitouch version of iWork, Apple's equivalent to Microsoft's Office software suite. Apple has declined to discuss any plans for a tablet.
 It is not known how many of the more than 100,000 applications available for the iPhone will run on the tablet. But Flurry's data indicates that the tablet will run an upgraded version of the iPhone's operating system, possibly running older applications in a small window on the screen.
 ''Apple has just spent a year and a half training developers to program their devices,'' said Carl Howe, director for consumer research at the Yankee Group, a technology consulting company. ''I don't think they're going to break that model.''
 Mr. Howe added that while he believed most of the current App Store offerings would work, they might look a little unusual.
 ''Taking a 3.5-inch experience and scaling it up to 10 inches or so would distort things,'' Mr. Howe said. ''But the guidelines for the original iPhone apps mention planning for more device sizes, so developers have thought about how their apps translate to larger screens.'' 
 A tablet may also bring changes to the economy of the App Store, where developers who choose to charge for their applications face market pressure to keep prices low, said Marc Strohlein, an analyst at the market research company Outsell. Many of the most popular paid apps sell for 99 cents.
 ''More memory and new features will encourage the development of more sophisticated apps of higher quality, which will push up the price tag,'' he said.
 Developers' excitement over the tablet could quickly fade if the device does not catch on with the public. ''Historically, tablet computers have not been big sellers,'' Mr. Strohlein said. ''No one has quite gotten it right before.''

HEADLINE: Volatility and Politics Are Feeding Fears of a Market Correction

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Brace yourself for another wild ride on Wall Street.
 Worries about the strength of the global recovery and proposals from Washington to clamp down on banks have sent fresh jitters through financial markets, prompting chatter among traders that stocks could be poised for that rare but alarming phenomenon: a correction.
 Such a development would mean a 10 percent or greater sell-off in everything from high-powered Nasdaq technology shares to bread-and-butter Dow industrials. 
 Over three tense days last week, stocks tumbled nearly 5 percent; the Dow posted triple-digit losses on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, ending the week at its lowest level since November.
 Some analysts believe the downward momentum may continue. They say the ingredients are there: a spike in volatility (up 55 percent in the three-day period last week, according to one gauge); activism from Washington (the Obama administration's crusade against risky banks and uncertainty over the future of the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke); and concerns over the slow pace of a global recovery (worries of a default in Greece and inflation in China).
 ''A confluence of all those headwinds creates a perfect storm of uncertainty on a market that had already been a bit vulnerable to a pullback,'' said Quincy M. Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial.
 ''But obviously the question is,'' she added, ''is this going to be something more than a normal healthy pullback?''
 A severe decline in the market is far from assured. There are no certainties on Wall Street, and stocks have been known to bounce back after similarly turbulent periods.
 At the same time, investors say the discrepancy between the gung-ho stock market and the ho-hum economic recovery is a sign that some sort of adjustment is under way. The energy of the rally in 2009, when the major indexes surged more than 20 percent, is waning, analysts say, and disappointments in the labor market and elsewhere suggest stocks may be out of step with economic reality.
 For months, as trading has been heavy and volatile, analysts have warned that a correction was coming; so far, they have been wrong. The first threat came in June and July, when the Dow declined 7.4 percent. In October, talk of a downturn surfaced again when the Dow tumbled 4 percent over seven days of ups and downs. Last week, a volatility gauge rose by the largest amount since 2007, and trading volume was again heavy.
 Further uncertainty about the economic outlook, coupled with a political clampdown on banks, could lead frightened fund managers to set off a chain reaction as they lock in profits from the 2009 rally, some analysts say.
 ''The panic comes in, and the selling takes over,'' said Ryan Detrick, a strategist for Schaeffer's Investment Research. 
 Mr. Detrick and other investors look positively on corrections for several reasons. In the eyes of traders, the risk of a long-lasting market downturn in the future decreases when stocks are in sync with economic conditions. Corrections also ''clear out the weaker hands,'' as a Wall Street adage puts it, letting fearful traders make an exit so more eager buyers can move in.
 ''Once all those people get out of the way,'' Mr. Detrick said, ''the bull market can continue and the uptrend can continue.''
 In the near term, an unusual degree of uncertainty may bring more losses to the stock market. 
 President Obama's proposals, on top of rumblings in Congress to tax bonuses and curb banker pay, took Wall Street by surprise and stoked fears that the president might face new political pressure to toughen his stance on big banks.
 And lawmakers' skeptical comments about Mr. Bernanke's performance as Fed chairman, ahead of a Senate vote on his reconfirmation, stirred so much unease in the market on Friday that the White House issued a statement over the weekend reiterating the president's confidence that Mr. Bernanke would be confirmed.
 In response, financial stocks, which investors consider a possible driver of growth in 2010, fell more than 3 percent on Friday, bringing their declines to about 5 percent for the week. 
 Investors have been unnerved by the Chinese government's efforts to prevent bubbles from developing in the real estate and stock markets. Hints that banks may slow lending set off alarms late last week, and analysts said it was becoming increasingly hard to gauge how swiftly Chinese officials and those of other developing nations would move to pre-empt inflation, which could slow the global recovery.
 ''The next few months will be dominated by finding a balance between controlling inflation and maintaining growth,'' said David Riedel, president of Riedel Research Group, which provides market analysis. ''Countries have to use fairly blunt instruments around particular concerns about inflation, and that creates a lot of noise and a lot of uncertainty in markets.''
 Complicating the picture are high expectations on Wall Street for earnings season. As companies release fourth-quarter results, investors are looking for signs that businesses have moved beyond cost-cutting and found ways to increase revenues.
 So far, investors have shrugged off even stunning positive results. Shares of Google, for instance, declined 5.66 percent on Friday, even after the company reported its strongest revenue growth in a year. American Express tumbled 8.47 percent after it said its earnings tripled.
 As more companies disclose their earnings this week, investors expect skepticism to linger, potentially feeding greater volatility in major stock markets. 
 A clearer sense of market sentiment may come this week with the release of data on the frail American housing sector and a report on fourth-quarter economic output. Expectations are restrained. Still, even meeting predictions may not be enough to ward off trouble for stocks. 
 ''We've come a long way in a short period of time,'' said Howard Silverblatt, an analyst with Standard & Poor's. ''You can't keep winning. You need retrenchment.''

HEADLINE: INSURER STEPS UP FIGHT TO CONTROL HEALTH CARE COST

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS

 BODY:
A front in the national health care battle has opened in New York City, where a major hospital chain and one of the nation's largest insurance companies are locked in a struggle over control of treatment and costs that could have broad ramifications for millions of people with private health insurance.
 The fight is between Continuum Health Partners, a consortium of five New York hospitals, including Beth Israel Medical Center and St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, both major teaching hospitals, and UnitedHealthcare, which includes Oxford health plans and has 25 million members across the country, one million of them in New York. 
 While Congress has been haggling over covering as many as 15 million uninsured Americans, the prestigious hospitals and the major health insurer have been in bitter contract negotiations, not just over rates but also over UnitedHealthcare's demand that the hospitals notify the insurance company within 24 hours after a patient's admission. If a hospital failed to do so, UnitedHealthcare would cut its reimbursements for the patient by half. 
 UnitedHealthcare says the proposed rule is meant to improve the quality of care and cut costs by allowing insurance case managers to jump in right away. The hospitals say that having their reimbursement cut in half is too much to pay for a clerical error, and that the revenue drain would ultimately hurt their patients.
 UnitedHealthcare is negotiating or imposing similar rules at hospitals across the country, and often meeting fierce opposition. Tennessee passed a law saying the penalty would not apply on weekends or federal holidays, when hospitals are short-staffed. Florida hospital officials said that the new rule could play a role in coming contract negotiations there, and that the state hospital association had asked Florida's insurance regulators to monitor the situation.
 The dispute signals a ''ratcheting up'' of a long tradition of insurers trying to cut costs, said Jeffrey Rubin, an economics professor at Rutgers University. 
 But Dr. Rubin said UnitedHealthcare's approach is particularly aggressive and might be part of a wave of pressure insurance companies feel from employers to cut costs and to keep premiums lower to avoid penalties, like the ''Cadillac tax'' on expensive insurance plans.
 ''It's an example of the insurance company getting between you and your doctor,'' Dr. Rubin said.
 Disputes between insurers and providers have flared up before, and it is rare for them to ultimately part ways. But the negotiations in New York have become especially tense. UnitedHealthcare has sent letters over the last few weeks to tens of thousands of patients, warning that they could be cut off from coverage at Continuum hospitals and affiliated doctors, and advising them to start shopping for new ones. Last year, 85,000 UnitedHealthcare customers received treatment from Continuum.
 The hospital system went to court and got an injunction preventing the insurance company from cutting access to Continuum doctors until the matter could be arbitrated. And the Greater New York Hospital Association, a trade group, has complained to the state attorney general that the 50 percent penalty would be ''confiscatory.'' The attorney general's office said it was reviewing the matter.
 Health care analysts say that such battles could become more common if federal policy promotes competition among insurance companies, perhaps including insurance exchanges, as an important engine for driving down health care costs. 
 The fate of health care reform in Congress is unclear now that Democrats have lost their filibuster-proof majority in the Senate. The House and Senate have not reconciled their disparate bills, but both proposals would prevent health insurers from excluding people with pre-existing conditions, which is one way they hold down costs. 
 So the insurers will need to find other ways to control expenses, said Sean Cavanaugh, an analyst for the United Hospital Fund, a New York-based research institute. ''That means you try to negotiate price reductions and control utilization, which is the hardest way for insurers to hold down costs,'' he said.
 The UnitedHealthcare-Continuum dispute may also be a sign of the times, a showdown between corporate oligopolies reminiscent of the recent fight between Time Warner Cable and the Fox Broadcasting network, only with the spoils being doctors and patients rather than cable television subscribers and ''American Idol.'' 
 UnitedHealthcare's New York chief executive, William Golden, said in an interview that the tension had been fanned by a greedy and intransigent hospital system that had been seeking unseemly rate increases of more than 40 percent. Mr. Golden said it was the toughest negotiation he had seen in 13 years.
 ''This negotiation is really coming down to affordability,'' Mr. Golden said. ''These are kind of unique circumstances for all of us involved. It's probably not surprising in this economic climate. There are tremendous pressures on all of us to make health care more affordable.''
 Kristin Binns, a spokeswoman for WellPoint, which runs Blue Cross plans in more than a dozen states and has more subscribers than any other company, said, ''We are not enforcing any sort of penalty'' like UnitedHealthcare's, and a spokeswoman for the American Hospital Association said that it knew of no other major insurer that did so. 
 Officials from Continuum Health Partners acknowledge that they are looking for rate increases to pay for rising costs of technology, drugs, overhead and union contracts. 
 The hospital chain said that after initial tough-guy posturing -- including a demand from UnitedHealthcare for a 7 percent to 10 percent cut -- both sides have narrowed the gap in their demands. But Continuum says the crux of the standoff is its refusal to bend to UnitedHealthcare's notification rules. 
 Some plans already ask patients and hospitals to notify their insurance companies of hospital admissions, but officials at Continuum and some other hospital systems say the penalty for noncompliance is either minimal or rarely enforced. In memos outlining the new policy, UnitedHealthcare officials have said that patient compliance with notification rules is erratic.
 Dr. Sam Ho, UnitedHealthcare's chief medical officer, said the company wanted to work with hospital staff to reduce the amount of time patients stay in the hospital, which is associated with complications like infection, and to prevent readmission, a major cost.
 ''If you had a car that needed to be repaired and then it had to go back in the garage within a week, then a month, then again in two months, then perhaps the original quality of the work that was done was substandard,'' Dr. Ho said. He said that UnitedHealthcare's push for notification was not motivated by money and that it would be happy if it never had to impose a penalty. 
 ''Absolutely, honestly, sincerely, this is a genuine attempt to try to improve outcomes for patients,'' he said.
 But Ruth Levin, Continuum's chief contract negotiator, said that the hospital chain did not believe that UnitedHealthcare could do a better job of reducing readmissions than its own medical staff could. Her account of negotiations on this point shows just how caustic they have become: ''When we say, 'Show me where you went to medical school,' then they back down,'' she said. 
 ''It's the ridiculous punitive nature of this,'' she said. ''If we provide a medically necessary service, we should be paid at the medically necessary rate.''
 UnitedHealthcare has been rolling out a similar policy across the country since 2007, but has repeatedly postponed deadlines and penalties in the face of opposition. Most recently, it postponed a Jan. 19 deadline to begin imposing the 50-percent penalty. (UnitedHealthcare documents suggest that in some cases, the full penalty would kick in only after 72 hours, but Continuum officials say that UnitedHealthcare is forcing them to negotiate such terms.)
 Integris Health, an 11-hospital system based in Oklahoma City, has tried to meet the notification requirement and has been frustrated by the administrative burden, even using electronic notification, said Greg Meyers, vice president for revenue integrity. ''That doesn't feel to us like cost control, it feels like a revenue stream enhancement to the insurance companies,'' Mr. Meyers said.
 Continuum officials say that cutting reimbursement in half would mean the loss of at least $25,000 for a patient who had bypass surgery and $15,000 to $20,000 for elective joint replacement.
 Dr. Gary Burke, a doctor affiliated with St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, said the letters warning that coverage with Continuum doctors could be cut off left some of his older patients panicked at the prospect of losing a long-term relationship with a doctor they trusted.
 ''They're kind of like, 'If I get sick, does this mean I can't see you?' '' Dr. Burke said.
 Continuum says it believes that some larger hospital systems have been able to negotiate immunity from the penalty. UnitedHealthcare officials refused to say whether that was true, saying that their contracts were subject to confidentiality agreements. Likewise, several other hospital systems, including the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation, which runs its public hospitals, and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, declined to discuss the terms of their contracts with UnitedHealthcare. 
 ''When all the other hospitals are doing it, we'll do it,'' Ms. Levin said. ''If you go out there and succeed with NewYork-Presbyterian, we'll do it. Then I think it's unreasonable for me to stand out there and say, 'Well, I can't.' ''

HEADLINE: At Festival In India, Books Are The Buzz

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

DATELINE: JAIPUR, India 

 BODY:
A crowd, some members sitting on the floor, listened attentively last week as the author Amit Chaudhuri described the influence of writers from Ireland and the American South on his work. 
 Outside the tent where he was speaking, fans and photographers mobbed the Indian poet Gulzar, who shared the Oscar for the song ''Jai Ho'' in ''Slumdog Millionaire,'' blocking his exit from a hall. Elsewhere the Pakistani wunderkind Ali Sethi was fending off people who wanted to have pictures taken with him. 
 That was just the first day of the Jaipur Literature Festival, a five-day extravaganza that in only five years has become the official annual celebration of a vibrant and resurgent Indian and South Asian literary scene. By the time the festival ends on Monday, organizers estimate that some 30,000 people will have seen more than 200 authors and other speakers. 
 Indians might be known worldwide for being mad about cricket and Bollywood musicals, but they are also increasingly embracing literature in all its forms. Book sales have been rising as incomes and literacy have steadily climbed in recent years. Even the country's once insular Hindi film industry, known for its formulaic song-and-dance dramas and thrillers, is taking notice of the boom and adapting popular novels into movies.
 Vikram Chandra, the author of ''Sacred Games,'' said that when he was attending boarding school near Jaipur, few authors commanded the kind of celebrity that was on display at the festival, where schoolgirls -- some from the elite Mayo College, at which he studied -- chased him and other authors down for autographs. 
 Literature in India ''was a cottage industry confined to the university,'' he said. But in the past decade, and especially in the past five years, a booming economy has created big audiences for books, including genres like literary fiction, young women's literature and children's books, which were tiny niches earlier. Book sales here are increasing at about 5 percent a year, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers.
 ''What we see now is intimately linked to the economic growth,'' said Mr. Chandra, who teaches creative writing at the University of California, Berkeley.
 One indicator of the vibrancy of literature in India today was the presence of film stars from Mumbai and socialites from Delhi at the festival, Mr. Chandra said. ''That itself is a sign of strength, when you can get the beautiful people in any culture to connect'' with a medium, he added.
 But for all the promise and potential of India's literary scene, plenty of challenges and tensions remain.
 Chiki Sarkar, the editor in chief of Random House India, said that while book sales were growing very quickly, most books still sell just a couple of thousand copies, a fraction of what even poorly performing books sell in the United States. 
 ''Our worlds are growing, and our markets are growing, but they are just beginning to grow,'' said Ms. Sarkar, who grew up in India but studied and worked in England before returning to work at Random House's new Indian operation three years ago. 
 The same could be said of the Jaipur Literature Festival. Started five years ago as part of a broader cultural festival, it has taken on a life of its own in the past three years. 
 The festival is a product of two very different personalities: William Dalrymple, who has spent much of his professional career writing about South Asia; and Namita Gokhale, a writer of Hindi books who started an earlier literary festival to highlight lesser-known Indian writers working in Indian languages. 
 From the start, Mr. Dalrymple said, he wanted the festival to be a stage for Indian literary luminaries like Salman Rushdie, Vikram Seth and Mr. Chandra, who, though born in India, live outside the country. But Ms. Gokhale was just as determined to make it a place to showcase lesser-known authors writing in Hindi, Tamil, Bengali and other regional Indian languages. 
 At one level their different aims dovetail, bringing together different threads of India's diverse linguistic and artistic traditions. At the festival, for instance, Ms. Gokhale organized a handful of sessions with writers who are Dalit, members of the lowest rung of the caste system. Mr. Dalrymple, for his part, delivered notable and sought-after writers like Wole Soyinka, Alexander McCall Smith and Niall Ferguson.
 That literary pedigree, combined with late-night music sessions by Indian and Western performers -- and the fact that the festival is free -- was a potent draw for visitors, who swelled into the front yard of the Diggi Palace, built in the 19th century.
 But the two themes -- the global India and the domestic India -- do not always easily blend. Some authors in India said they had little interaction with foreign writers. The foreigners, for the most part, spent time with one another and with Indian writers from the West. Mr. Dalrymple and Ms. Gokhale acknowledge that their different interests often turn into heated arguments about the festival program.
 Omprakash Valmiki, one of the Dalit writers, said that he felt that his and other books written in Hindi were starting to find bigger audiences at home and abroad. (His autobiography, ''Joothan: A Dalit's Life,'' was published in English by Columbia University Press in 2003.)
 Mr. Valmiki, who has a day job as an engineer at an Indian government defense factory, said he almost turned down the invitation to attend the festival because he thought it would be too exclusive. But he said he was glad he had come after all, because the sessions he participated in were packed. Though he had few conversations with writers working in English, he said he was pleasantly surprised when a former chief minister of Rajasthan state stopped him and told him she had bought his book and was looking forward to reading it. 
 ''Things change slowly,'' he said in Hindi. ''Literature can't create a revolution overnight. It creates a base that changes society over time.''

HEADLINE: Big Food

 BODY:
As huge corporations merge and get even huger, we find ourselves yearning for some old-fashioned competition, and maybe a little diversity. 
 Banks have gotten so big that they can unleash havoc and bill us for the pleasure. Big Oil is so big that Royal Dutch Shell is the world's 25th-biggest economy, bigger than Norway. Four -fifths of the chips in the world's PCs come from Intel. In the United States, AT&T and Verizon account for over half of all cellular phone customers. Big companies are likely to become even bigger. Between 2003 and 2007, the number of big mergers reported to American antitrust regulators doubled to 2,201. Though merger activity fell during the financial crisis, it is expected to rebound sharply. There is already another behemoth lumbering toward consumers: Big Food. 
 The latest news is Kraft's planned purchase of Britain's Cadbury to create a mac-and-cheese-to-candy-bar megalith with combined worldwide sales of nearly $55 billion. It comes on the heels of Heineken's purchase of the beer operations of Mexico's Femsa to create a $25 billion megabrewer. These aren't even the dominant companies in their business. Switzerland's Nestle is almost twice as large as Kraft. Heineken will now be about the same size as the brewing colossus built in 2008 when Belgium's InBev bought Anheuser-Busch. At the end of 2008, 10 companies accounted for two-thirds of the world's beer sales, up from 40 percent in 2000. 
 Consolidation is sold by corporate gurus as rich in synergy and efficiencies that eventually trickle down to consumers. But the supposed consumer benefits are often unconvincing. Pennzoil's acquisition of Quaker State led to more expensive motor oil, Procter & Gamble's purchase of Tambrands led to more expensive tampons, and General Mills' purchase of the Chex brands led to more expensive cereal, according to one study. Despite limits imposed by antitrust regulators, the merger between Guinness and Grand Metropolitan to create the food and drink giant Diageo led to substantial increases in the price of Scotch. 
 Price isn't the only concern. Whether you quaff a Baisha in China, a Diekirch in Luxembourg or a Pacena in Bolivia, you're paying the same company that sold you that Bud. Call us pessimists, but chances are it won't be long before they all taste the same.

HEADLINE: Corporate Antagonism Goes Public

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
When Time Warner Cable was tussling over fees with the News Corporation, it did something that would have been unthinkable in the backrooms where deals were once struck: it hired a political consultant to mount a public campaign against its own client. 
 Bruce Haynes, a Republican strategist and managing director at the Washington firm Purple Strategies, helped create ads asking customers if Time Warner should ''Roll Over or Get Tough'' over fees with the News Corporation's Fox division. In November, a month before its contract with Fox expired, Time Warner Cable began running television, Internet and print ads.
 ''We said, we ought to get some political advice and frame it, somewhat, from those lessons,'' said Sam Howe, chief marketing officer of Time Warner Cable. ''Name names, and give customers some information.''
 Fox and Time Warner Cable are playing nice now -- they announced an agreement on Jan. 1. But the episode is just one example of how once-private business negotiations are spilling into public view. 
 Two weeks ago, Conan O'Brien released a statement criticizing NBC in an attempt to reach as many people as possible. The same day, Google, rather than conducting backroom negotiations with Chinese officials, posted a blog item saying it would no longer adhere to censorship policies on its Chinese sites. 
 And in another nasty cable fight that was resolved just last week, Scripps Networks recruited its stars from the Food Network and HGTV in ads complaining that Cablevision, a New York-area cable provider, had removed the channels from the service. In retaliation, Cablevision ran ads encouraging viewers to complain directly to the Scripps chief executive. 
 What's happening, according to some observers, is a shift in how business negotiations are conducted -- from closed and discreet to open and political. 
 ''There's a code of the past that we keep things in the boardroom and don't go public,'' said Bobby Calder, chairman of the marketing department at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management. ''What you're seeing is, I think, a realization that you can go outside and gain some negotiating power.''
 The campaigns play to populist sentiment, asking the public to do the right thing, an approach that also draws from politics. They create a public spectacle, a narrative that distills dull subjects like contract negotiations into a good-guy, bad-guy conflict -- a Harvard Business School case study turns into a shootout with Liberty Valance. 
 ''Customarily these kinds of decisions are business decisions that we can make rationally,'' said David A. Owens, a professor of management at Vanderbilt's Graduate School of Management. But the narrative businesses are using now ''evokes an emotional response,'' he said. ''It makes business a drama.''
 The tactics are examples of what economists call signaling: when two parties in a transaction have different information, one can transmit messages about his status or power by sending signals -- or, in this case, buying advertising meant to show that the public is on his side.
 ''You want it to be interesting enough for people to participate in the campaign,'' said Mr. Haynes, who worked on the Time Warner strategy. It seemed to work: the two companies worked out their differences. The 1.2 million visitors to the RollOverOrGetTough.com site had helped ''terrifically'' in the talks, Mr. Howe said. 
 Sunil Gupta, the head of the marketing department at Harvard Business School, said that it is difficult to measure the effectiveness of these campaigns. ''I doubt that you can do a controlled experiment of any sort to truly understand the effectiveness. The effects of such P.R. efforts are generally intangible.'' 
 And these signals can conflict, creating another hazard: by going public with customers, companies are explicitly criticizing the people on the other side of the negotiations, as Time Warner did with Fox and Conan O'Brien had been doing almost every night on NBC's own network, until his final show on Friday. 
 ''You can't do that too many times -- you destroy trust, you destroy a sense of protocol,'' Mr. Owens said. ''Negotiations have been done the way they've been done for a reason.''
 Part of the reason for the public shift is technological. With Twitter, Facebook and Web sites, companies can solicit support easily. ''If you go back 20 years, it would've been very, very hard to solicit feedback from millions of customers,'' said Chris Nelson, director of crisis management at the public relations firm Ketchum, which advised Time Warner Cable on its strategy. ''Now, it's a piece of cake.''
 On Jan. 12, Google took what spokesman Gabriel Stricker characterized as ''an unusual step,'' publishing a blog post announcing that human rights activists had been targets of computer attacks from China, and in response, Google would stop censoring search results in China. 
 ''The outcome we were hoping for here is the same thing we've always hoped for: to be able to operate securely in China and in a way that increases access to information for our users in China,'' Mr. Stricker said via e-mail.
 But another outcome was a turnaround in Google's reputation. Long criticized for acting monopolistically, Google is getting commendations from civil liberties and privacy groups and even from young people who are leaving flowers outside its offices in China.
 Though he was fighting for a television time slot and not freedom of speech, Mr. O'Brien used a similar tactic when, on Jan. 12, he issued a statement on PRNewswire. Mr. O'Brien's letter, addressed to ''People of Earth,'' discussed how long and hard he had worked for his ''Tonight Show'' hosting job, and expressed his ''enormous personal disappointment'' about NBC's decision. 
 The Internet audience came back with overwhelming support for Mr. O'Brien, with fan groups forming on Facebook, and Twitter users declaring their support.
 ''If you are in this company's negotiation, and you want more leverage, if there are hundreds of thousands of people speaking in favor of you, that certainly helps,'' said Mr. Gupta.
 Like Mr. O'Brien, companies are exploiting their direct ties to customers. Scripps Networks, in its battle with Cablevision, had been running ads with the Food Network stars Bobby Flay and Sandra Lee. The company also turned its sites ILoveFoodNetwork.com and ILoveHGTV.com into advocacy sites. 
 But Scripps did not find unanimous support there, a sign that companies run the risk of alienating not only their business partners, but their customers as well. Several respondents said Scripps ''created the situation,'' as one poster said. Others asked what fees it was charging Cablevision, or tried to calculate exactly how much Scripps was demanding.
 The companies eventually settled on Jan. 21. But Cindy McConkey, a Scripps spokeswoman, said the company had removed its ads more than a week before that. ''I think they grew weary of it,'' she said of her customers. ''And we did too.''

HEADLINE: After 10 Years, Federal Money For Technology in Education

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH JENSEN

 BODY:
More than a decade ago, Lawrence K. Grossman, former president of both NBC News and PBS, and Newton N. Minow, the former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, were asked by several foundations to explore how nonprofits like schools, libraries and museums could tap into emerging digital technologies. 
 Their bold recommendation in 2001 was to set up a multibillion dollar trust that would act as a ''venture capital fund'' to research learning technology. 
 After a tortuous journey -- ''It's been one 'starting all over again' after another after another after another,'' Mr. Minow said -- their organization, what is now being called the National Center for Research in Advanced Information and Digital Technologies, finally has Congressional appropriation through the Education Department and will be introduced Monday. It could be handing out grants by fall.
 ''It's time that education had the equivalent of what the National Science Foundation does for science, Darpa does for the national defense and what N.I.H. does for health,'' Mr. Grossman said in an interview. He and Mr. Minow, senior counsel at the law firm Sidley Austin, will be the co-chairmen of the nonprofit organization, along with Anne G. Murphy, former director of the American Arts Alliance. 
 James H. Shelton III, the assistant deputy secretary for innovation and improvement at the Education Department, has been shepherding the new center. ''We're really excited about exploring the opportunities for advanced technology in education,'' he said. ''The vision that started Digital Promise was well before its time. Its time has finally come.''
 To build support for the project, the group created three prototypes: an educational video game for biology students called Immune Attack; a game for museums, called Discovering Babylon; and a computer simulation to train firefighters in high-rise fires. They typify the projects the center will be looking to finance. 
 Mr. Minow said he was disappointed that a major component of the original plan -- to use some of the proceeds from the government auction of wireless spectrum as financing -- never came to be; the money was spent elsewhere. And the request for an initial federal appropriation of $50 million, made when the center was authorized in 2008, was reduced to $500,000; the center will also solicit private funds. 
 The project has bipartisan support, but ''the economy collapsed and you couldn't get that kind of money,'' Mr. Minow said. 
 Still, ''what we have will get us started,'' he said, adding that he was confident growth would follow a few successful projects. The National Science Foundation, Mr. Grossman said, started in 1950 with a six-figure appropriation; its fiscal year 2009 appropriation was nearly $6.5 billion.

HEADLINE: Border Tribe Feels Stuck in Middle of Drug War

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

DATELINE: SELLS, Ariz. 

 BODY:
An eerie hush settles in at sundown on the Tohono O'odham Nation, which straddles 75 miles of border with Mexico.
 Few residents leave their homes. The roads crawl with the trucks of Border Patrol agents, who stop unfamiliar vehicles, scrutinize back roads for footprints and hike into the desert wilds to intercept smugglers carrying marijuana on their backs and droves of migrants trying to make it north.
 By the bad luck of geography, the only large Indian reservation on the embattled border is caught in the middle, emerging as a major transit point for drugs as well as people. 
 A long-insular tribe of 28,000 people and its culture are paying a steep price: the land is swarming with outsiders, residents are afraid to walk in the hallowed desert, and some members, lured by drug cartel cash in a place with high unemployment, are ending up in prison. 
 ''People will knock on your door, flash a wad of money and ask if you can drive this bale of marijuana up north,'' said Marla Henry, 38, chairwoman of Chukut Kuk district, which covers much of the border zone.
 The tightening of border security to the east and west, which started in the 1990s and intensified after the Sept. 11 attacks, funneled more drug traffic through the Tohono O'odham reservation, federal officials said, and especially more marijuana, which is hard to slip through vehicle crossings because of its bulk. 
 A record 319,000 pounds of marijuana were seized on the reservation in 2009, up from 201,000 pounds the previous year, along with small amounts of cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine. 
 Hundreds of tribal members have been prosecuted in federal, state or tribal courts for smuggling drugs or humans, taking offers that reach $5,000 for storing marijuana or transporting it across the reservation. In a few families, both parents have been sent to prison, leaving grandparents to raise the children. 
 ''People are afraid that if they say no, they'll be threatened by the cartel,'' Ms. Henry said.
 If residents of remote villages tried to call the police, she said, help might not arrive for two hours or more. 
 At the same time, some residents are angry at the intrusion of hundreds of federal agents, including some who stay for a week at a time on bases in remote parts of the reservation. The surge in agents who cruise the roads has meant more checkpoints and tighter controls on a border that tribal members, 1,500 of whom live in Mexico, once freely crossed. 
 The once-placid reservation feels like a ''militarized zone,'' said Ned Norris Jr., the tribal chairman, who also says the tribe must cooperate to stem the cartels. ''Drug smuggling is a problem we didn't create, but now we're having to deal with the consequences.'' 
 Many residents say they live in fear of the smugglers and hordes of migrants who lurk around their homes, and also of being subjected to a humiliating search by federal agents. 
 The elderly avoid the desert, even in the daytime, because they might stumble upon a cache of marijuana or drug ''mules'' hiding in desert washes until dark.
 ''We can't even go out to collect wood for the stove,'' said Verna Miguel, 63, who was traumatized three years ago when a group of migrants forced her to stop on a road, beat her and stole her vehicle. 
 ''We've always picked saguaro fruits and cholla buds,'' Ms. Miguel said, using such desert products for consumption and rituals. ''But now we don't dare do that.'' 
 Until recently, the reservation's international border was porous, defended by three strands of barbed wire. Over the last two years, it has been lined with metal posts and Normandy-style barriers to stop the trucks that used to barrel through and head for Phoenix. 
 Federal officials describe the rise in drug seizures on the reservation as a sign of growing success on what had long been a vulnerable section of border. Barriers and surveillance have forced most of the smugglers to enter on foot rather than in vehicles and spend hours or days sneaking through the reservation, making them more vulnerable to detection, said Agent Robert Gilbert, chief of the Tucson sector of the Border Patrol. 
 But the large busts, here and elsewhere on the border, are also a measure of the continued trade and profits reaped by the cartels. 
 ''The cartels use the profit from marijuana to purchase cocaine in Colombia and Peru and the ingredients for meth and heroin from other regions,'' said Elizabeth W. Kempshall, special agent in charge of the Arizona office of the Drug Enforcement Administration. ''So marijuana is the catalyst for the rest of the drug trade.'' 
 The drug smugglers, mainly working for the Sinaloa Cartel, officials said, place scouts for days at a time on mountainsides, with night-vision goggles to monitor movements of the Border Patrol. The scouts communicate with Mexican or Indian guides using cellphones or two-way radios with rolling codes that cannot be intercepted, said Sgt. David Cray of the tribal police force, which has spent major amounts of money on border issues. During the day, the scouts hide in caves or under camouflage. 
 The Border Patrol has its own spotters and trucks with infrared video cameras that detect heat miles away. The tribe has agreed to electronic surveillance towers that in coming years will make a ''virtual fence'' across their lands. 
 Many agents spend their nights ''cutting for sign,'' a tracker's term, making slow drives on dirt roads in search of footprints. 
 One recent chilly night, a Border Patrol spotter detected eight white dots on his screen moving steadily north, not meandering the way cows or wild mules do. With a laser beam he fixed their coordinates at a spot five miles from his mountaintop post. 
 Two agents in four-wheel-drive vehicles set out over a rutted ranch track, then hiked through half a mile of mesquite, cholla and prickly pear to intercept the group. Six escaped, but two Mexican men were captured with seven burlap packs, each filled with 50 pounds of marijuana that sells wholesale for $500 or more per pound. 
 For the agents, it was a good night's work. ''This is what we live for, stopping drugs,'' said an agent who hiked in shortly after the bust to help bring in the smugglers and the contraband. 
 But many tribal members see the federal presence as a mixed blessing at best. 
 Ofelia Rivas, 53, of Meneger's Dam Village is an Indian rights advocate and a rare border resident who agreed to speak to a reporter. She said that most families in border villages, including her own, had had a relative imprisoned for drug offenses, but that such individuals should not be blamed for the lack of legal jobs. Ms. Rivas has criticized tribal leaders for acquiescing to what she calls an oppressive federal occupation. 
 Federal law officials praise the tribe for its cooperation, and the Border Patrol has fielded community relations officers to minimize frictions. 
 Even Mr. Norris, the tribal chairman, said he had been stopped and questioned. ''Quite frankly, the people are getting sick of it,'' he said of the heavy outside presence. But he added that the smuggling was beyond the tribe's ability to control. 
 ''I hope in my lifetime we can go back to the way it used to be,'' Mr. Norris said, ''where people could go and walk in the daylight on our own land.''

HEADLINE: Accounts, People & Miscellany

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
Accounts
 Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos, Boston, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, decided against taking part in a review for the account of the CVS drugstore chain owned by CVS Caremark, Woonsocket, R.I. CVS spends about $90 million a year on advertising and Hill, Holliday had been its main agency. When the review began this month, Hill, Holliday said it would participate; the agency said in a statement last week that ''after careful consideration'' it had decided not to take part. Hill, Holliday is among several agencies on the CVS roster that handle tasks like creative and media services. 
 Cumberland Packing Corporation, Brooklyn, named the New York office of Mother as creative agency of record for brands like Sweet'N Low, Sugar in the Raw, NatraTaste and Butter Buds. Spending for the account, which had been at Pedone, N.Y., was estimated at $6 million. 
 People
 Alex Bogusky, co-chairman at Crispin Porter & Bogusky, Miami and Boulder, Colo., part of MDC Partners, was named to a new post at MDC, chief creative insurgent, where he will oversee the creative output of all MDC agencies. Mr. Bogusky will be given a new title, founding partner, at Crispin Porter, where Chuck Porter, who had been co-chairman, becomes the sole chairman. 
 Gina Sanders, vice president and publisher at Lucky magazine, New York, part of the Conde Nast Publications unit of Advance Publications, was named president and chief executive at the Fairchild Fashion Group unit of Conde Nast. She succeeds Richard D. Beckman, who left to join e5 Global Media, New York, as chief executive.
 Sandy Grushow joined MediaLink, Los Angeles, as chief creative officer, a new post. He had recently started Filmaka, a digital entertainment company, and before that had been chairman at the Fox Television Entertainment Group, part of the News Corporation. Mr. Grushow will no longer be involved in day-to-day operations at Filmaka while continuing to hold an interest in the company, MediaLink said. 
 Scot McLernon joined YuMe, Redwood City, Calif., as chief revenue officer, a new post. He had been president at the Upstream Group, based in the Santa Cruz, Calif., office.
 Miscellany
 Interpublic Group of Companies, New York, opened Split, a boutique with 30 employees that will specialize in creative technology. Split will be led by Greg Smith, chief information officer at the McCann Worldgroup unit of Interpublic and aligned with McCann.
 The Advertising Council, New York, and the American Red Cross are introducing another public service announcement to encourage donations to Haiti earthquake relief. The commercial features Morgan Freeman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Tim McGraw, Julie Roberts, Meryl Streep and Reese Witherspoon. The spot was created pro bono by GSD&M Idea City, Austin, Tex., part of the Omnicom Group, with the help of the Creative Artists Agency Foundation. A commercial in Spanish, featuring Eva Longoria Parker, is scheduled to be introduced this week. The council previously was responsible for public service announcements featuring Michelle Obama and the former presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.

HEADLINE: Democrats, Get Down to Business

BYLINE: By HAROLD FORD Jr.. 
Harold Ford Jr. was a United States representative from Tennessee from 1997 to 2007.

 BODY:
SCOTT BROWN'S victory last week in the Massachusetts Senate race, following the Republican gubernatorial triumphs in New Jersey and Virginia, marked the third time in three months that the Democratic Party has lost the support and trust of independent voters.
 The message these voters sent was clear. With one out of five Americans unemployed or underemployed, President Obama and the Democratic Party need to shift attention away from health care and toward a bold effort to create jobs, improve the economy and rein in the size of government. 
 Here are four simple steps we must take immediately to put us, and the nation, on a better course:
 First, cut taxes for businesses -- big and small -- and find innovative ways to get Americans back to work. We can start by giving any companies that are less than five years old an exemption from payroll taxes for six months; extending the current capital gains and dividend tax rates through 2012; giving permanent tax credits for businesses that invest in research and development; and reducing the top corporate tax rate to 25 percent from 35 percent.
 America's primary job-creating machine -- the private sector -- needs to be rejuvenated. Democrats must lead now on job creation or risk forfeiting Congressional majorities in November.
 Second, we should pass a more focused health reform bill that restructures current health care costs before spending more, prohibits insurance companies from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions, enacts responsible reform on malpractice suits and extends health coverage to all children. And we must allow states to have input into the expansion of health coverage, as they will have to pay for much of the reform themselves. 
 This program isn't all that Democrats wanted from health care reform right now, but it's what the country wants. And it's what the country can afford.
 Third, we should reform our immigration policy to ensure that those who contribute to our economy, especially foreign math and science graduates of American universities, have a clear path to citizenship.
 Finally, we need to address budget deficits now rather than waiting for some ideal future economic situation. It's a good sign that the Obama administration is following the advice of Senators Kent Conrad of North Dakota, Evan Bayh of Indiana and other Democratic fiscal pragmatists who embrace the idea of a bipartisan commission to recommend spending cuts to rein in deficit growth. But we must be sure that the administration and Congress heed the commission's advice.
 By focusing on job creation and deficit reduction, we can expand our economy and balance the budget. We've done it before: When President Bill Clinton took office in 1993, he inherited a record fiscal deficit after years of Republicans in the White House. After eight years in office (and 22 million jobs created), President Clinton had balanced the budget and left his successor with a surplus. This can be done again.
 To be sure, President Obama has achieved some important successes. His policies prevented the financial system from collapsing, saved America's auto industry from extinction and avoided a depression. But that extreme crisis is over -- what our country needs now is better, not more, government.
 A Democratic Party refocused on revitalizing our economy, protecting the United States from terrorism and re-establishing itself as the party for the middle class is what Americans are demanding. If we do this, victory at the polling booths will take care of itself.

HEADLINE: Obama to Offer Aid for Families In State of Union

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama will propose in his State of the Union address a package of modest initiatives intended to help middle-class families, including tax credits for child care, caps on some student loan payments and a requirement that companies let workers save automatically for retirement, senior administration officials said Sunday.
 By focusing on what one White House official calls ''the sandwich generation'' -- struggling families squeezed between sending their children to college and caring for elderly parents -- Mr. Obama hopes to use his speech on Wednesday to demonstrate that he understands the economic pain of ordinary Americans. The proposals also include expanded tax credits for retirement savings and money for programs to help families care for elderly relatives.
 The address is still being written, but one senior official, describing it on the condition of anonymity, said its main themes would include ''creating good jobs, addressing the deficit, helping the middle class and changing Washington.'' 
 With his poll numbers down and Democrats fearing disaster in this year's midterm elections, Mr. Obama is at a particularly rocky point in his presidency and has been shifting his rhetoric lately to adopt a more populist tone. He heads into his first formal State of the Union speech in a radically reshaped political climate from even one week ago.
 His top domestic priority, a health care overhaul, is in jeopardy after the Republican victory in last week's Massachusetts Senate race -- a setback that White House advisers interpret as a reflection of Americans' deep anger and frustration over high unemployment and Wall Street bailouts.
 One advantage of the president's proposals is that they might appeal to people who are struggling financially without looking like the kind of broad expansion of the federal government that is making many Americans uneasy. They also would add little to the federal deficit at a time when Mr. Obama is pledging to reduce it. 
 Mr. Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. plan to outline the proposals on Monday when they meet with the White House task force that has spent the past year examining ways to help the middle class. 
 While Mr. Obama has been shifting his focus toward job creation in recent weeks, an official said the president also wanted to spotlight what the White House regards as ''critical areas where middle-class families need a helping hand to get ahead,'' like paying for college and saving for retirement. 
 For example, the president is calling on Congress to nearly double the child care tax credit for families earning less than $85,000 -- a proposal that, if adopted, would lower by $900 the taxes such families owe to the government. But the credit would not be refundable, meaning that families would not get extra money back on a tax refund.
 Another of the president's proposals, a cap on federal loan payments for recent college graduates at 10 percent of income above a basic living allowance, would cost taxpayers roughly $1 billion. The expanded financing to help families care for elderly relatives would cost $102.5 million -- a pittance in a federal budget where programs are often measured in tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars. And the automatic paycheck deduction program would simply be a way to encourage workers to save, and would include tax credits to help companies with administrative costs.
 Such programs are, notably, much less far-reaching than Mr. Obama's expansive first-year agenda of passing an economic recovery package, bailing out the auto industry, overhauling the health care system, passing energy legislation and imposing tough new restrictions on banks. That agenda has left him vulnerable to criticism that he is using the government to remake every aspect of American society.
 Top advisers to the president insist that Mr. Obama is not in retreat and are resisting any comparisons to the kind of small-bore initiatives that the last Democratic president, Bill Clinton, used to try to get his presidency back on track.
 ''In no way does this represent a trimming of the sails,'' one adviser said on Sunday, referring to the package.
 Instead, the White House wants to use Wednesday's address to explain how initiatives like the health care overhaul fit into his broader plan for job creation and the economy. On Sunday, as senior administration officials fanned out on the television talk shows, David Axelrod, Mr. Obama's senior adviser, insisted that the health care bill was not dead. But he did suggest that the administration was now more focused on changing insurance practices than on a broad expansion of coverage to the uninsured.
 ''There are so many elements of this -- tax breaks for small business, extending the life of Medicare, more assistance for seniors with their prescription drugs, a cap on out-of-pocket expenses, help for people with pre-existing conditions -- that are too important to walk away from,'' Mr. Axelrod said on the ABC program ''This Week.''
 With House and Senate leaders trying to figure out how to proceed legislatively, Mr. Axelrod also issued a warning to Democrats who were reconsidering their support for the health care measure. 
 ''As a political matter, the foolish thing to do would be for anybody else who supported this to walk away from it,'' he said. He added, ''The underlying elements of it are popular and important, and people will never know what's in that bill until we pass it, the president signs it and they have a whole new range of protections they never had before.''
 How Mr. Obama will address health care in the State of the Union speech, though, remains an open question. Officials on Capitol Hill and at the White House said their talks on how to proceed with the legislation might not be resolved by Wednesday. This could put Mr. Obama in the awkward position of talking about a measure that is on shaky ground. 
 Another open question is what the president will say about his program for job creation. 
 The House of Representatives has passed a $154 billion bill to encourage job creation, and during an appearance in Ohio on Friday, Mr. Obama called for a jobs bill that would include tax breaks for small businesses and for people who make their homes more energy efficient. White House officials have not said what Mr. Obama's jobs bill would cost, and they did not say on Sunday if he would mention a specific amount in Wednesday's address.
 But they did try to hit hard on the jobs theme. And Mr. Axelrod, speaking on ''State of the Union'' on CNN, said Mr. Obama's current predicament was no surprise.
 ''A year ago, I said to the president, 'A year from now, your numbers are going to be much different than they are right now because of the economic forecast that we were hearing,' '' he said. ''And we knew that even as the economy started growing, it would take time for the jobs to follow.''

CORRECTION-DATE: January 26, 2010

 CORRECTION:
An article on Monday about President Obama's planned State of the Union proposals intended to help middle-class families described incorrectly nonrefundable tax credits, like the expanded child care credit Mr. Obama is expected to propose for families earning less than $85,000. Nonrefundable credits are those that do not result in cash payments for people who pay no income tax. They reduce the tax liability, and therefore may increase the refund, of households that do pay taxes.

HEADLINE: The Bernanke Conundrum

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

DATELINE: A Republican won in Massachusetts 

 BODY:
and suddenly it's not clear whether the Senate will confirm Ben Bernanke for a second term as Federal Reserve chairman. That's not as strange as it sounds: Washington has suddenly noticed public rage over economic policies that bailed out big banks but failed to create jobs. And Mr. Bernanke has become a symbol of those policies.
 Where do I stand? I deeply admire Mr. Bernanke, both as an economist and for his response to the financial crisis. (Full disclosure: before going to the Fed he headed Princeton's economics department, and hired me for my current position there.) Yet his critics have a strong case. In the end, I favor his reappointment, but only because rejecting him could make the Fed's policies worse, not better. 
 How did we get to the point where that's the most I can say?
 Mr. Bernanke is a superb research economist. And from the spring of 2008 to the spring of 2009 his academic expertise and his policy role meshed perfectly, as he used aggressive, unorthodox tactics to head off a second Great Depression.
 Unfortunately, that's not the whole story. Before the crisis struck, Mr. Bernanke was very much a conventional, mainstream Fed official, sharing fully in the institution's complacency. Worse, after the acute phase of the crisis ended he slipped right back into that mainstream. Once again, the Fed is dangerously complacent -- and once again, Mr. Bernanke seems to share that complacency.
 Consider two issues: financial reform and unemployment.
 Back in July, Mr. Bernanke spoke out against a key reform proposal: the creation of a new consumer financial protection agency. He urged Congress to maintain the current situation, in which protection of consumers from unfair financial practices is the Fed's responsibility.
 But here's the thing: During the run-up to the crisis, as financial abuses proliferated, the Fed did nothing. In particular, it ignored warnings about subprime lending. So it was striking that in his testimony Mr. Bernanke didn't acknowledge that failure, didn't explain why it happened, and gave no reason to believe that the Fed would behave differently in the future. His message boiled down to ''We know what we're doing -- trust us.''
 As I said, the Fed has returned to a dangerous complacency.
 And then there's unemployment. The economy may not have collapsed, but it's in terrible shape, with job-seekers outnumbering job openings six to one. Nor does Mr. Bernanke expect any quick improvement: last month, while predicting that unemployment will fall, he conceded that the rate of decline will be ''slower than we would like.'' So what does he propose doing to create jobs?
 Nothing. Mr. Bernanke has offered no hint that he feels the need to adopt policies that might bring unemployment down faster. Instead, he has responded to suggestions for further Fed action with boilerplate about ''the anchoring of inflation expectations.'' It's harsh but true to say that he's acting as if it's Mission Accomplished now that the big banks have been rescued.
 What happened here? My sense is that Mr. Bernanke, like so many people who work closely with the financial sector, has ended up seeing the world through bankers' eyes. The same can be said about Timothy Geithner, the Treasury secretary, and Larry Summers, the Obama administration's top economist. But they're not up before the Senate, while Mr. Bernanke is.
 Given that, why not reject Mr. Bernanke? There are other people with the intellectual heft and policy savvy to take on his role: among the possible choices would be my Princeton colleague Alan Blinder, a former Fed vice chairman, and Janet Yellen, the president of the San Francisco Fed. 
 But -- and here comes my defense of a Bernanke reappointment -- any good alternative for the position would face a bruising fight in the Senate. And choosing a bad alternative would have truly dire consequences for the economy.
 Furthermore, policy decisions at the Fed are made by committee vote. And while Mr. Bernanke seems insufficiently concerned about unemployment and too concerned about inflation, many of his colleagues are worse. Replacing him with someone less established, with less ability to sway the internal discussion, could end up strengthening the hands of the inflation hawks and doing even more damage to job creation.
 That's not a ringing endorsement, but it's the best I can do.
 If Mr. Bernanke is reappointed, he and his colleagues need to realize that what they consider a policy success is actually a policy failure. We have avoided a second Great Depression, but we are facing mass unemployment -- unemployment that will blight the lives of millions of Americans -- for years to come. And it's the Fed's responsibility to do all it can to end that blight.

HEADLINE: The Glass Industry, Domestic and Foreign

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Another Shifting Industry'' (Business Day, Jan. 19):
 Contrary to your article, the American glass industry is not dead. Carlisle PPG, a company in the state of Pennsylvania, bid for and lost the contract for the World Trade Center site. 
 The decline of the domestic glass industry has the same root causes as the overall decline of American manufacturing: unfair Chinese economic policies that heavily favor export-led growth and a lack of political will to properly enforce our nation's trade laws. 
 For years, China has fed its unprecedented economic expansion through the undervaluation of its currency. China's pegging of its currency to the dollar has caused a surge in the United States trade deficit and has been a major factor in the loss of American manufacturing jobs. According to a report by Dr. Usha C. V. Haley of Harvard University, the domestic glass industry alone lost 40,000 jobs from 2001 to 2008.
 While I commend the Obama administration for its recent decision to impose tariffs on Chinese tires, the lack of enforcement of our trade laws over the previous decade played a key role in the loss of American jobs. That is why I have urged the Obama administration to directly address the decline of the American glass industry with the Chinese. 
 The effect of Chinese subsidies and market manipulation can't be underestimated. Bob Casey U.S. Senator from Pennsylvania Washington, Jan. 20, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Your article about China's booming glass industry is correct in one respect: the playing field is not level for world glass production. China is brazenly cheating its way to the top through vast subsidies and dumping. 
 It's no wonder, then, that American glass producers and their workers are losing ground. But the answer is not simply to walk away from manufacturing. To avoid a ''jobless recovery,'' the administration needs to enforce United States trade laws and prevent China's mercantilist policies from dismantling another American industry.

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths MOSBACHER, ROBERT ADAM SR.

 BODY:
MOSBACHER--Robert Adam Sr.,Twenty Eighth United States Secretary of Commerce in the Administration of President George H.W. Bush, an accomplished oilman and industry leader, and a champion amateur sailor, died on Sunday, the 24th of January 2010, of cancer at the age of 82. Bob was born in Mt. Vernon, NY on March 11, 1927 to Emil and Gertrude Mosbacher and was the youngest of three children. He grew up in White Plains, NY before moving to Texas in 1948. He graduated from the Choate School in Wallingford, CT and Washington and Lee University. At a very early age, he established himself as one of the premier competitive sailors on Long Island Sound winning the 1939 Long Island Sound Midget Sailing Championship, and the 1941 and 42 Long Island Sound Atlantic Class Championships. 
He went on to amass a number of national and international titles. He was the only amateur sailor to win World Championships in three different Olympic classes. His sailing exploits and those of his brother, Bus, earned them a joint photo on the cover of the May 19, 1959 issue of Sports Illustrated. At the age of 21, and on the advice of his father, Bob moved to Houston with his first wife, Jane Pennybacker, to build an independent oil and gas company. The next decade would bring four wonderful children - Diane, Robert Jr., Kathryn, and Lisa. However, tragedy struck when his beloved Jane succumbed to leukemia in 1970. In the meantime, Bob built a highly successful energy exploration and production company with interests primarily in Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. At different times over the past 50 years, the company has had profitable investments in the Rocky Mountains, Michigan, Canada, Spain, the Philippines, Venezuela, India, and more. Since 1950, Mosbacher has participated in the discovery and/or development of hundreds of millions of barrels of oil, and almost a trillion cubic feet of natural gas. The business has had the good fortune of a very dedicated and loyal group of employees who have shared in the successes, as well as the disappointments over the years. Bob is deeply grateful to his Mosbacher Energy family, both past and present, for their support. His decades of oil and gas experience, coupled with his astute business judgment, led others to seek his counsel, resulting in his heading a host of industry organizations including the National Petroleum Council, The All-American Wildcatters' Association, the U.S. Oil and Gas Association and others. Bob was long considered a consummate dealmaker who was always willing to take risk, but within acceptable parameters. Out of a deep desire to give something back to his country, he got involved in elective politics in the 1960's. Although he served as Harris County Chairman of the 1968 Nixon Campaign, it was his loyal friendship with, and devoted support of George H. W. Bush that would lead him to the national political stage. In fact, Mosbacher managed the national fundraising operations for five different GOP presidential campaigns - from Gerald Ford in 1976 to John McCain in 2008. He was regarded by friend and foe alike as one of the most effective political fundraisers in modern history, partly because of the respect he commanded as a business leader, and because he never asked others to support a candidate or cause he was not supporting actively himself. Following the 1988 election, he was asked by then President-elect George H.W. Bush to join his Cabinet as the 28th U.S. Secretary of Commerce. He was honored by the opportunity to serve his country and on February 3, 1989, he was sworn in by his close friend, Secretary of State James A. Baker, III, with President Bush looking on. His principal accomplishments while at the helm of the Commerce Department from 1989 until early 1992 included laying the foundation for the North American Free Trade Agreement, helping shrink America's trade deficit with Japan and South Korea, and aggressively promoting U.S. exports through the strengthening of the U.S. Foreign and Commercial Service of the Commerce Department. His role in helping negotiate NAFTA prompted Mexican President Ernest Zedillo to present Mosbacher with the "Order of the Aztec Eagle," the highest decoration offered by the Mexican Government to non-citizens. He was particularly proud later in life to have served as Chairman of the Americas Society and Council of the Americas; on the board of the Naval Academy Endowment; and as founder and president of the board of the Odyssey Academy Charter School in Galveston. Just recently, he was honored to learn that the Robert A. Mosbacher, Sr. Institute for Trade, Economics and Public Policy is being created within the George Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University. Bob had a quick, warm smile, a wonderful sense of humor, and a fun-loving way about him that was contagious. He was deeply devoted to his family and felt that he was one of the luckiest men in the world to have been mentored by his father "Pop" along with respected business friend Max Fisher, and to have lived such an incredible life with a family he adored and friends like fellow oilman Chesley Pruet and his dear friend and lawyer, Randy Smith. His survivors include his wife of ten years, Michele "Mica" Mosbacher; sister Barbara Susan Mosbacher; daughter Diane and her spouse Nanette Gartrell; son Rob; daughter Kathi and her spouse Michael Wheeler; daughter Lisa and her spouse Downing Mears; grandchildren Peter (and wife Lucy), Jane, and Meredith Mosbacher, Parker, Whitney (and wife Katie), and Bayly Mears; stepson Donald Cameron Duncan III and his spouse Brittanie Hoster Duncan; stepsons Robert and Lloyd Gerry; a step-grandchild; as well as numerous nephews and cousins. His older brother, Emil "Bus" Mosbacher, passed away in 1997. Services in Houston are with Geo. H. Lewis & Sons, The Funeral Directors Since 1936, www.geohlewis.com, 713-789-3005. A celebration of Bob's life is to be conducted at 10am on Wednesday, January 27, at Memorial Drive Presbyterian Church, 11612 Memorial Dr. in Houston, TX. In lieu of customary remembrances, donations may be sent to the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (mdanderson.org), the newly created Mosbacher Institute at the Bush School at Texas A&M University (http://bush.tamu.edu/mosbacher/memorial), or the Odyssey Academy Charter School in Galveston (odyssey-academy.com).

HEADLINE: Unexpectedly Weak December Home Sales Raise New Questions About Federal Aid

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD

 BODY:
Home sales plunged more than expected in December, raising fresh questions about whether the housing market can function without ample government assistance.
 Sales of existing homes in December fell 16.7 percent from November, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.45 million units, the National Association of Realtors said Monday. 
 Analysts had been expecting a weak number. Sales of existing homes were pushed up in the fall by fears that the government's $8,000 tax credit for first-time buyers would be allowed to expire as scheduled on Nov. 30. As buyers rushed to sign contracts, sales rose to an annual rate of 6.54 million units in November, the highest level in nearly three years. 
 The credit was broadened and extended in November, and potential buyers lost their sense of urgency. December sales were at the lowest annual rate since August, though still 15 percent higher than December 2008.
 Most experts expect sales in January to be equally weak, but think that activity will once again increase as the next, and supposedly final, expiration date for the tax credit draws near. Unless Congress extends the credit again, buyers have until April 30 to conclude a deal.
 What happens after that is harder to predict. 
 ''Given that the tax credit appears to account for a good deal of the improvement in the housing market,'' Paul Dales, an economist for Capital Economics, wrote in a research note, ''we're becoming increasingly concerned that the housing recovery will falter once it is removed.''
 The credit is the government's most visible means of support for the housing market but not the only one. Two of the biggest are also undergoing changes.
 The Federal Housing Administration, which has been supporting the market by insuring loans to first-time buyers, is modestly tightening its standards. And the Federal Reserve, which has been buying mortgage-backed securities in an effort to keep mortgage rates low, says it is ending that program over the next few months.
 Government programs can do only so much. Buyers are still at the mercy of lenders, which have become reluctant to make home loans.
 David Arslanian, an Internet advertising executive in Boston, was waiting Monday to find out if his loan had come through. He took a moment to marvel at the contrast between his experiences this time and his previous purchase of a house, in Philadelphia in 2001.
 The first time, the entire process -- looking, bidding, making a deal and getting a loan -- took about a month, he recalled. In that era, long before the excesses of the boom had ruined everything, home-buying was a relatively routine process, little more complicated than buying a car.
 This time, Mr. Arslanian and his wife, Anna, a doctor, looked for more than two years. Few of the houses they saw seemed to be good deals. But since the market was declining, they felt no rush.
 Finally, they found a two-family house in Belmont, a suburb, that offered potential. Their bid in the upper six figures was accepted, but getting a loan was arduous. Several banks declined to give them mortgages under any terms, despite their down payment of 25 percent. 
 In 2001, Mr. Arslanian showed his lender two pay stubs. ''This time, I've sent every bank stub for the last year, every canceled rent check, letters from my landlord,'' he said. ''Every day, I'm on the phone with the loan officer trying to reconcile another piece of information.''
 Three out of four regions of the country shared relatively equally in the December drop. The Midwest was down 25.8 percent from November; the Northeast fell 19.5 percent; and the South slid 16.3 percent. The West fared best, down 4.9 percent.
 The number of homes on the market is continuing to fall, dropping to 3.29 million. But since sales fell even faster, the supply on the market rose to 7.2 months of inventory in December, from 6.5 months in November. Larger inventories often portend a drop in prices. A normal market has about a six-month supply. 
 Distressed homes accounted for about a third of all sales in December, down from levels approaching 50 percent earlier in the year but also much higher than in a normal market.
 Another sign of poor health in housing is the continued weakness in new home construction. In many markets, builders cannot compete with the price of foreclosures. The Commerce Department reported last week that December starts were at a seasonally adjusted annual sale rate of 557,000, only about 16 percent above the record low last April.
 The real estate association said that 2009 was the first year since 2005 to record an annual sales gain. Sales in 2009 were up 4.8 percent from 2008.
 With the December drop, the release on Tuesday of the Case-Shiller home price data for November will be watched even more closely than usual. After a summer and fall of modest improvement, analysts are expecting the results to be unchanged at best from the previous month. 
 Another price index, from First American CoreLogic, reported last week that November prices dropped 0.2 percent from October.

HEADLINE: Kerrigan's Father Dies; Her Brother is Charged

BYLINE: By KATIE ZEZIMA

DATELINE: WOBURN, Mass. 

 BODY:
The brother of the former Olympic figure skater Nancy Kerrigan was charged Monday with assaulting their 70-year-old father, who died after being found unconscious by the police. 
 Mark Kerrigan, 45, pleaded not guilty to assault and battery against his father, Daniel, at an arraignment in Woburn District Court on Monday afternoon. Mark Kerrigan, who buried his head in his hands and wept during the proceeding, was ordered held on $10,000 cash bail. 
 Authorities said the case was still under investigation. An autopsy is being performed to determine Daniel Kerrigan's cause of death. 
 Middlesex County District Attorney Gerard T. Leone Jr. said in a statement that any additional charges against Mark Kerrigan would depend on the chief medical examiner's report.
 Mark Kerrigan's lawyer, Denise Moore, said her client was an unemployed plumber and Army veteran who is being treated for post-traumatic stress disorder. 
 ''Mr. Kerrigan is extremely distraught at the death of his father,'' Moore said during the arraignment.
 Mark Kerrigan was released from jail late last year after serving time for a 2005 assault conviction and was living in his parents' basement. In 2008, Kerrigan had been sued by his parents for money they provided him, but that case was dismissed. 
 Middlesex Country Assistant District Attorney Elizabeth Keeley said Brenda Kerrigan, who is legally blind, called 911 during the altercation between her husband and son. Brenda Kerrigan later told the police, who arrived at the family's Stoneham home around 1:25 a.m. Monday, that the men were arguing and shoving each other until Daniel Kerrigan fell.
 Mark Kerrigan, who was in the basement of the home when officers arrived, ''appeared intoxicated,'' was ''belligerent and combative'' toward the police and subdued with pepper spray, according to the police report. Mark Kerrigan told officers, according to the report, that he ''wanted to use the phone and his father would not let him.'' 
 The report added: ''He said he struggled with his father and put his hands around his father's neck, and his father fell to the floor. He said his father was faking it.'' 
 According to the police report, officers found Daniel Kerrigan lying unresponsive on the kitchen floor, which was stained with blood. A photograph had been knocked off the wall, and a piece of broken phone lay on the ground. 
 Daniel Kerrigan was transported to Winchester Hospital, where he died. 
 In an interview with The Boston Herald early Monday, Brenda Kerrigan said her husband died of a heart attack. 
 ''My God; he had a heart attack,'' Brenda Kerrigan told the newspaper. ''That's what it was.'' 
 Paul Wylie, a 1992 Olympic silver medalist and a close friend of Nancy Kerrigan's, said that Daniel Kerrigan was a working-class individual, coached both of his sons in hockey and bore none of the affected personality that can sometimes be found in the figure-skating community.
 ''He had a gravelly, deep voice and he was a real refreshing presence,'' Wylie said. ''He'd come to my apartment and say, 'Paul, if you did this with your windows, you could save money on your heating bills.' Or, 'Your rear tire is low; you should get it checked.' He was an eternal father type. These were heart-of-gold people.''
 In 2005, Mark Kerrigan was convicted of assault and battery on his wife, Janet, and two counts of destruction of property. According to the report, Janet Kerrigan called the police after fleeing the home during an argument. The police found Mark on the front porch if his home in Wilmington, Mass., with two hunting knives in his hands. As the police drew their weapons Mr. Kerrigan threatened ''suicide by cop.'' 
 A year later, Janet Kerrigan, who called her husband an ''angry drunk'' in the police report, filed a restraining order against Mark Kerrigan. It is unclear if they are still married.
 Mark Kerrigan served four months of a two-year suspended sentence starting in September 2005. He was ordered to serve the remainder of the full term after violating parole. 
 A number of cars sat parked in the driveway of the family's home in suburban Stoneham, about 10 miles north of Boston. The neat, beige two-story home with green shutters sits tucked off a road filled with large colonials and tidy ranches. 
 Around 2:30, Nancy Kerrigan and her husband, Jerry Solomon, exited the house in a downpour and got into a black Cadillac that another family member drove away. Two other cars then left the home. 
 Mark Kerrigan is due back in court Feb. 24.

HEADLINE: Seeking a Place at Airports

BYLINE: By SUSAN STELLIN

 BODY:
Virgin America has managed to survive skyrocketing oil prices and an economic crisis since it started in mid-2007 and even hopes to achieve an operating profit this year.
 But the airline, based in San Francisco, still faces the same hurdle that has daunted previous start-ups: getting access to scarce runway slots and terminal gates at some of the nation's biggest and busiest airports. 
 ''We've been told at Newark that we can't get in, and we've been told at J.F.K. that we can't expand,'' David Cush, Virgin America's chief executive, said, referring to negotiations with the Federal Aviation Administration, which has limited flight operations at both airports to ease delays. 
 Even if an airline can gain access to runway slots at appealing times, it must negotiate the right to use an airport's gates, which are typically controlled by the airport authority and airlines that have long-term leases. Established airlines have been reluctant to sublease their gates to low-fare competitors. Or, if they do, they demand high rents, which is why airlines like Southwest have gravitated toward secondary airports like Chicago Midway instead of O'Hare International Airport.
 Virgin America has been trying to establish service at O'Hare, where a runway built in late 2008 opened more takeoff and landing slots but has not yet opened the door to new competition.
 ''Ninety-nine percent of the departures out of O'Hare are operated by legacy carriers, and that is quite unique given the size of the market,'' Mr. Cush said, but added that he was optimistic he could negotiate access to gates at O'Hare ''in the next couple of months.''
 The battle over access to slots is also likely to intensify this year as the economy recovers and the F.A.A. revisits the issue.
 In 2008, the government tried to assert its authority and address delays, by proposing to reclaim and auction off about 10 percent of the slots at La Guardia, Newark Liberty International and Kennedy airports. That idea succumbed to challenges from the airlines and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns all three airports. But the F.A.A. is working with the current administration to develop a new plan for the slots, said Robert E. Robeson, who manages the agency's policy analysis division.
 ''I know the airlines have some disagreement with our decision on this, but the F.A.A. position is that we own the slots,'' he said.
 Nor is the issue of access solely about competition from new airlines. Aviation specialists contend that the legacy airlines have effectively hoarded their slots by scheduling small planes that pay lower landing fees. But those small planes, the specialists argue, clog runways that could be used for bigger jets carrying more people, contributing to an inefficient system of allocating scarce resources.
 ''If we let US Airways or American or Delta run 175 of these little 50-seat planes out of La Guardia and use up the runway capacity, that means JetBlue and Southwest and America West can't come in,'' said Hubert Horan, an aviation consultant who is among those supporting flat-rate landing fees, instead of fees based on weight.
 ''That doesn't solve the problem but it will break the logjam,'' Mr. Horan said, adding that the higher cost of hoarding would motivate airlines to trade slots or schedule bigger planes.
 But he conceded that such a remedy was unlikely to be adopted, for the same reason that proposals to auction off slots or charge higher landing fees at peak times, known as congestion pricing, have run aground.
 ''Every vested interest is opposed for one reason or another,'' he said. 
 While the recession pushed this issue aside, it is bound to return to the fore as the economy improves and airlines increase their schedules -- or sooner if the March 1 closing of a crucial runway at Kennedy Airport for repaving worsens delays.
 Yet the recession has also spurred some movement in the gate-slot trade. The bankruptcy of ATA Airlines enabled Southwest to buy ATA's slots at La Guardia for $7.5 million last spring -- its entry into New York City's major airports. And US Airways has agreed to swap some of its slots at La Guardia for some of Delta Air Lines' slots at Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington, in a deal some analysts predict will lead to more efficient use of La Guardia's sought-after runways.
 ''US Airways had these very valuable assets and in all candor was misusing them by flying very small planes,'' said Darryl Jenkins, a consultant who posted his analysis of the transaction at TheAirlineZone.com. These types of deals have also enabled some start-up airlines to negotiate their way into busy airports. JetBlue is now a major tenant at Kennedy Airport -- and even opposed the F.A.A.'s slot auction plan -- and will soon be the largest airline at Logan International Airport in Boston, expanding as other airlines have cut back.
 But it is still struggling to get access to other destinations, said Robin Hayes, the airline's chief commercial officer, citing Reagan National as an airport ''we still have not been able to penetrate.''
 ''In some cases, you'll find carriers hanging on to gates even when they don't need them just to stop other airlines from coming in,'' he said.
 Analysts say the success of Virgin America and other low-fare airlines suggests that competition is good for the industry and consumers. 
 ''Cities like Chicago should be working to find ways to bring airlines like Virgin America in,'' said Henry H. Harteveldt, a travel analyst for Forrester Research.
 ''The fact that Virgin America is still flying is a testament to the product, the people and the management,'' he said. ''Clearly, they're making it because they're selling something enough people want to buy.''

HEADLINE: Patient Safety: Conversation to Curriculum

BYLINE: By DANIEL BLUMENTHAL and ISHANI GANGULI. 
Daniel Blumenthal and Ishani Ganguli are fourth-year students at Harvard Medical School.

 BODY:
Two summers ago, as bright-eyed third-year medical students, we rushed into clinics and operating rooms, eager to apply our textbook knowledge at last to the daily practice of working with patients. 
 To our untrained eyes, the system in which we were expected to deploy this knowledge was often baffling, with its unfamiliar rituals of scribbled notes and morning rounds. And it was at its most baffling when things did not go according to plan: if a patient took an unexpected turn for the worse, was that because of natural causes or medical error? 
 Since the publication of the well-known Institute of Medicine report in 1999 estimating that medical errors kill as many as 98,000 people a year, the topic has become part of the national conversation. More recently, a study in The New England Journal of Medicine and a new book, ''The Checklist Manifesto,'' by Dr. Atul Gawande (Metropolitan Books, 2009), have testified to the efficacy of surgical checklists and the value of encouraging all members of a surgical team to speak up about potential sources of error. 
 But so far, the conversation has been slow to trickle down to medical schools. 
 A 2008 survey by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education, which accredits United States medical schools, reported that two-thirds of medical schools mentioned patient safety in a required course, with an average of two sessions on the topic. 
 But another survey of 391 medical students by the nonprofit Institute for Healthcare Improvement found that four out of five felt their exposure to the topics of patient safety and quality improvement had been fair at best. And Dr. David Davis, senior director for continuing education and performance improvement at the Association of American Medical Colleges, told us there was ''still some debate'' about how and when to teach this material.
 Why haven't medical schools moved faster? For one, medical education is a zero-sum game, with vast amounts of material to cover. Dr. Donald M. Berwick, president of the health care institute, said the idea that schools ''should give up the Krebs cycle or membrane transport'' -- basic biochemistry concepts -- for patient safety was hard to swallow. Further, doctors tend to put a much higher value on their own clinical skills than on communication and cross-checking. While ''medicine has historically valued disciplinary excellence -- doing your doctoring or surgery right,'' Dr. Berwick said, most errors probably ''lie at interfaces and handoffs'' from one doctor to another. 
 In 2003, deans at 10 medical schools, including Dartmouth, the University of Minnesota and the University of Illinois, formed a collaborative group to foster communication across disciplines. Each school experiments with teaching strategies, then shares the results with the collaborative. 
 At Dartmouth, for instance, students participate in debriefing sessions with teams of medical professionals trained to respond quickly to in-hospital emergencies. Courses at other schools have invited parents of children injured or killed as a result of errors to talk with students about their experiences, putting a human face on the problem.
 In a new three-week course on patient safety, fourth-year students at the University of Pennsylvania spend time at the Wharton School of Business. Among other things, they learn how Toyota's model of product reliability can be applied to health care. 
 ''The final piece is the economic analysis,'' said Dr. Richard Shannon, chairman of the Penn health system's department of medicine. ''What does this mean? What do hospital infections cost in real dollars?'' 
 Through such sessions, students can learn how medical errors are defined and how to tell an error from a negative outcome, said Dr. Melissa A. Fischer, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. As she emphasizes to her students, ''bad things can happen even when everything is done right.''
 Because curriculum change at a national level has been slow, organizations like Dr. Berwick's institute are taking another approach: reaching out to students who are eager to tackle these issues. 
 The institute's new Open School for Health Professions is a hub of free online courses, case studies and discussion forums addressing errors and other quality improvement topics. The school went live in fall 2008 and has already registered more than 20,000 students, with more than 173 school- and hospital-based chapters in 41 states and 24 countries, according to its director, Jill Duncan.
 The challenge is translating open discussion among medical, nursing and pharmacy students in online forums into open discussion on the hospital floor, and in turn, into day-to-day change in health care quality. Studies have implicated poor communication in medical errors -- especially between doctors of different ranks -- and demonstrated the role of open communication in improving patient outcomes. 
 As fresh observers of hospital dynamics across specialties, medical students are in an ideal position to effect change by speaking up. But patient safety experts question whether doctors, particularly those in hierarchical fields like surgery, are really ready to hear it -- especially, Dr. Berwick said, from medical students, who run the risk of being labeled ''troublemakers'' and ''naive.'' 
 These factors suggest a pressing need for a cultural shift, one that dissolves the secrecy surrounding medical errors and allows trainees and seasoned doctors to speak openly about their mistakes and those their colleagues have made. 
 The psychological safety of this blame-free setting can feel scarce indeed in some high-powered institutions. A classwide poll of third-year students revealed that most of us had witnessed errors by superiors or peers or had committed them ourselves -- and demonstrated our striking ignorance of what to do about them. 
 Harvard's limited coursework on this topic is by no means unique among medical schools. But as we came to realize, the tenets of avoiding medical error must be learned and enforced in real time. 
 So on the wards we did our best to develop good habits: rechecking medication flow sheets to ensure that a patient was getting the treatments we ordered, or making the trek from the on-call room to the nurses' station at 4 a.m. to confirm that he was scheduled for his early morning CT scan.
 It took a degree of humility to ask what seemed the obvious question and confidence to approach senior doctors with our own literature search on the best way to manage a patient's unruly hypertension.
 The hope is that thinking through these issues, and understanding the advantages and flaws of current practices, will help us become better doctors.
 ''What's the purpose of medical school? And what is the product we have in mind? And who ought to answer that?'' asked Dr. Lucian Leape, a patient safety researcher at the Harvard School of Public Health. ''When I go to a doctor, I should have somebody who I know is competent, who I know I can trust and who will put my interests first. Two of those three have nothing to do with science.''

HEADLINE: Bankers Return to Davos With a Bit Less Swagger

BYLINE: By JACK EWING

 BODY:
Bankers are trickling back to Davos, but they will not be strutting quite the way they used to. 
 With an economic recovery under way, the financial elite will not be in hiding as they were last year, when only a comparative handful showed up in Davos, Switzerland, for the annual World Economic Forum. But they will still be on the defensive. The prospects for tighter regulation, which seemed to be fading a few months ago, look more likely than ever. 
 Amid popular outrage about soaring profits and bonuses, political leaders and economic policy makers seem intent on making progress toward some kind of rulebook that would prevent another bank-led crisis of the financial system. 
 ''We cannot afford to have a financial system which is as fragile in the future as it has proved to be in the past,'' the European Central Bank president, Jean-Claude Trichet, said this month. 
 The world's top bankers will arrive in Davos just as the political mood in Washington and other capitals is turning against the financial industry again. Last week, President Obama called for laws to keep financial institutions from becoming too big, as well as restrictions on risky practices that include betting bank capital on securities markets.
 In Europe, leaders are responding to voter frustration at having to pay for bank bailouts even as unemployment continues to rise.
 The governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, has raised the prospect of breaking up the big financial institutions in that country. Britain and France plan to tax banker bonuses, while European Union officials are working on a regional bank regulation agency. 
 Some bankers say they support new rules, at least in principle. The chief executive of Deutsche Bank, Josef Ackermann, a co-chairman of the World Economic Forum, said in a video posted to YouTube that he favored regulations on the amount of capital banks were required to hold, as well as better mechanisms for winding down sick institutions. 
 But there is widespread suspicion that bankers are hoping, now that the risk of a collapse of the financial system has retreated, to return to business as usual.
 ''In the midst of the crisis there was a certain willingness among banks'' to accept restrictions, said Erik Berglof, chief economist of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which was involved in preventing a financial debacle in Eastern Europe. ''Now what I see is a certain forgetfulness of what happened in the crisis.''
 Expectations are high among participants that Davos could contribute to the debate. ''I am more optimistic now than I have been in recent months,'' said Barry Eichengreen, a professor of economics and political science at the University of California, Berkeley, who will moderate a panel on financial regulation featuring Mr. Trichet. 
 While all agree on the need for a sturdier financial system, the tough part will be creating uniform standards that apply around the world. Inconsistency would encourage ''regulatory arbitrage'' in which big banks set up operations wherever local rules are most comfortable, Mr. Eichengreen and others said.
 The United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen last month, widely regarded as a failure, left some Davos attendees skeptical that countries could agree on a common course when it comes to financial regulation.
 ''The decision-making process stinks,'' said Ben Verwaayen, chief executive of the telecommunications equipment maker Alcatel-Lucent and a Davos participant. ''You see national governments taking action depending on what's happening in their national theaters.''
 The World Economic Forum, which runs from Wednesday through Sunday, will have several panels on an overhaul of the financial system, which should help keep the issue on the public agenda. There will also be a series of private meetings of government representatives and bank chiefs, who will meet separately in Davos and then together.
 After avoiding Davos last year -- only months after Lehman Brothers collapsed and the financial crisis was at its height -- bankers are cautiously returning. They will number 235, forum organizers said, a 23 percent increase from 2009. 
 Prominent financial executives scheduled to attend include John J. Mack, chairman of Morgan Stanley; Robert E. Diamond Jr., president of Barclays; and Brady W. Dougan, chief executive of Credit Suisse. The chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs, Lloyd C. Blankfein, is not on the guest list, but its president, Gary D. Cohn, will be part of a Goldman delegation.
 The bankers will take a lower profile than in the precrisis days, however. That is all right with organizers of the World Economic Forum, who say that the event had become too focused on money and glamour. ''Until 2007, there was maybe an overparticipation of the finance industry in Davos,'' said Klaus Schwab, the executive chairman of the forum.
 Some bankers, like Stephen K. Green, group chairman of HSBC Holdings, are willing to take some blame for the crisis. ''The fact of the matter is that banks played a significant role in the unstable conditions, and we have to learn the lessons,'' Mr. Green said in a statement. 
 But other bankers complain that their industry is taking all of the criticism for a disaster that was also fed by easy-money policies of governments and wanton borrowing by consumers. Stephen S. Roach, Morgan Stanley's chief economist, predicted that Davos participants ''will fall into the trap of trying to figure out a way to blame the bankers and exonerate the politicians and central bankers who really condoned the era of greed and excess.'' 
 No one expects participants to emerge onto the snowy streets of Davos triumphantly waving a global accord on bank supervision. Even if there were broad agreement, any new regulations would require an extraordinary amount of work on the technical details. 
 But the discussions that take place during the forum could help advance a process begun at the meeting of the Group of 20 developed and emerging economies in Pittsburgh in September, when members created a Financial Stability Board to devise uniform banking rules. One area of common ground that seems to be emerging is a requirement that banks stockpile more capital in good times to see them through the downturns.
 Despite his skepticism about international decision-making, Mr. Verwaayen said he thought that the advantage of the annual pilgrimage to Davos was that it brought together a diverse group of leaders in an informal setting.
 ''You have academics, you have N.G.O.'s, you have politicians, you have business,'' Mr. Verwaayen said, referring to nongovernmental organizations. ''Where else do I find that assembly of stakeholders?''

HEADLINE: A Question Of Fairness Among States

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
Are you a Minnesotan first, or an American? Do you worry about protecting and defending Vermont, or the United States? Is it O.K. for the economy to thrive in North Dakota, but wither in Michigan? 
 And when it comes to social services, should people in some states get better access to health care than those in others? 
 The question of equality, or inequality, among states is a major reason President Obama's overhaul of the health care system, and the legislation in Congress to make it happen, seemed to reach the brink of collapse last week. And it is a reflection of one of the biggest challenges Mr. Obama and Congressional leaders have faced since they began tackling health care last year: how to devise a national solution for a problem that varies sharply from state to state. 
 Those variations came into sharp focus last week when Massachusetts, where 5.4 percent of the population is uninsured, held a special election that will have huge implications for all states, including Texas, where 25.2 percent of residents are uninsured. 
 More than anything else, a paragraph on Page 2,129 of the Senate health care bill may be the primary reason Mr. Obama is now fighting for the survival of his top domestic priority. 
 Widely derided as the ''Cornhusker kickback,'' it called for the federal government to pay the full cost of a planned Medicaid expansion for Nebraska while other states would eventually pay a small part of the expense. 
 Senate Democratic leaders added the provision to secure the support of Senator Ben Nelson, Democrat of Nebraska. Mr. Nelson has since disavowed it and called for all states to be treated equally. 
 Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California perhaps summed up the outrage best. ''He got the corn,'' he said in his State of the State address. ''We got the husk.'' 
 The Nebraska provision has gotten far more publicity, for instance, than a provision that would provide tax credits of up to 50 percent to small-business owners who offer health benefits to their employees, or another that would authorize $200 million in grants to small businesses to help them start comprehensive wellness programs for their employees. 
 The public simply could not swallow the idea of Nebraska's getting a free ride at the expense of 49 other states. The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, singled out the provision on Thursday as a reason rank-and-file House Democrats would not just approve the Senate bill and send it to Mr. Obama. 
 Doing so would circumvent the obstacle created for Democrats when a Republican, Scott Brown, won last week's special election in Massachusetts, denying Democrats the 60th Senate vote they needed to overcome a Republican filibuster and pass a revised bill. 
 But Ms. Pelosi said the Nebraska provision made that impossible. ''There are certain things that members just cannot support,'' she said. ''For example, the Nebraska piece of it. And so what they would want to see fixed is that there be equity among states, more fairness, and that that policy shouldn't be made on the basis of one senator, but on the basis of one country.'' 
 Mr. Obama, too, seemed to have the Nebraska provision in mind Friday when he told a town-hall-style meeting in Elyria, Ohio, that he recognized that the legislative wheeling and dealing had been off-putting. 
 ''When you deal with 535 members of Congress, it's going to be a somewhat ugly process,'' the president said. ''Not necessarily because any individual member of Congress is trying to do something wrong. It's just they may have different ideas; they have different interests.'' 
 He added: ''They're looking out for their constituents a lot of times. But when you put it all together, it starts looking like just this monstrosity.'' 
 The Nebraska provision is one example of a larger clash over the competing interests of states that has bogged down the health care debate from the start and reflects a broader question about the different roles of the federal and state governments. 
 Both the House and the Senate bills would broadly expand Medicaid, extending coverage to about 15 million people by 2019. 
 Expanding Medicaid is a relatively efficient way to reduce the number of uninsured, but because states share in the cost, many governors balk at the idea. 
 The cost-sharing serves a crucial purpose, encouraging states to keep expenses in check. Last week, after the bill had stalled, the Congressional Budget Office said that giving every state the same deal as Nebraska would cost the federal government an additional $35 billion over 10 years -- a substantial amount. 
 There have been other disputes. States like California and New York, with more generous Medicaid programs, argue that they would get short-changed if the federal government gave additional aid to states only for ''newly eligible'' Medicaid recipients, which would send a disproportionate share of new money to states with stingier Medicaid programs, like Alabama and Mississippi. 
 All states participating in Medicaid must cover children and pregnant women within certain family income guidelines. But states have been allowed to expand eligibility, and the result has been a system rife with disparities. And Congress has often tinkered with the formulas for federal aid in ways that have created additional layers of inequity. 
 Jonathan Bates, the president of Arkansas Children's Hospital, has seen the real-life impact of the Medicaid mishmash. His hospital is a leader in heart transplants and sometimes treats children from out of state. But the lower Medicaid payment rates of other states mean the hospital must navigate bureaucracy before performing such major surgery, or risk not getting paid. 
 ''We have to negotiate that price up front,'' Dr. Bates said. ''Because if we take the patient and do the transplant and then send the bill, they'll deny it because it has to be preapproved.'' 
 In the case of some emergencies, Dr. Bates said, hospital officials found themselves ''up in the middle of the night trying to find somebody at a state agency who can say yes or no on something like that.'' 
 That does not, however, happen with patients who live in Arkansas. ''For what it's worth,'' he said, ''we have perhaps one of the more spectacular Medicaid programs in the country.'' 
 Jim Frogue, a Medicaid expert with the Center for Health Transformation, a group founded by Newt Gingrich, said the state-by-state variation could provide a road map for making improvements. 
 Mr. Frogue pointed to innovative programs, like Healthy Indiana, which uses a combination of Medicaid dollars and tobacco settlement money to provide basic health coverage to low-income adults; and to Florida, which started demonstration projects in an effort to reduce Medicaid costs and improve patient results. 
 ''Some states do a much better job of providing care than others,'' he said. ''Let's build on what works and scale down what doesn't.''

HEADLINE: Agreement On Effort To Help Rebuilding

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY and GINGER THOMPSON; Ian Austen contributed reporting from Montreal.

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti 

 BODY:
Concerned about corruption and wobbly Haitian leadership, international donors agreed Monday during a meeting in Montreal on a 10-year rebuilding effort for earthquake-damaged Haiti, one that would create an even better capital city and that the government said would cost $3 billion. 
 Given Haiti's long history of mismanagement of funds, international donors were hesitant to write a blank check. And foreign governments had concerns as well about the government's ability to direct a large reconstruction project after most government buildings were flattened or severely damaged in the Jan. 12 quake.
 Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive, addressing representatives from 14 countries and the European Union, tried to head off such fears. ''The Haitian government is working in precarious conditions,'' he said at the opening of the conference, ''but it can provide the leadership that people expect.''
 To show he was still running the country, President Rene Preval, whose office at the National Palace was destroyed, sent aides to the palace grounds to begin the process of building temporary offices and lodging for him there. His private home was also destroyed in the quake, and he has been running the government out of a police station, with his ministers addressing the news media under a mango tree. 
 Mr. Preval, who has yet to formally address the country since the earthquake, also issued a written plea for immediate aid on Monday, asking for 200,000 sturdy, family-size tents and 1.5 million food rations.
 Patrick Delatour, a presidential aide, said the $3 billion that the government needs to remake the country would be used to house 200,000 people left homeless in 200 model communities complete with schools and health care centers, as well as to rebuild government ministries and national infrastructure.
 But the government's figure was not immediately embraced by the countries being called on to pick up the tab. A United States State Department official called it premature. And Mr. Bellerive said that Haiti had made no specific requests for money or other assistance in Montreal because it was still assessing its needs.
 ''We're trying to do this in the correct order,'' Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton told reporters in Montreal. ''Sometimes people have pledging conferences and pledge money, and they don't have any idea what they're going to do with it. We actually think it's a novel idea to do the needs assessment first and then the planning and then the pledging.''
 The donor nations called for an independent damage assessment, which could begin as early as next week, made up of experts from the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank and the United Nations Development Program. 
 ''This is an opportunity,'' said Eric Overvest, the Haiti director for the United Nations program. ''You can see opportunities in awful situations, and it is possible to rebuild a better Port-au-Prince.''
 Before the quake, the capital had been dangerously overcrowded, with makeshift homes built on the steep hillsides surrounding the city and narrow, winding roads clogged with traffic. Construction standards were all but absent. ''We have to do things differently,'' said Jacques Gabriel, the minister of public works. ''We're sending a message to the population not to rebuild their damaged homes. It's not safe. We need to evaluate the buildings first.''
 The donor nations agreed that the Haitian government would be front and center in the international effort to rebuild the country, with the United Nations acting as a conduit for donations. They also agreed that the aid would be closely tracked.
 ''We bear a responsibility to our taxpayers to assure that the money that our government commits will be well spent, transparently, and with results on the ground for the Haitian people,'' Mrs. Clinton said.
 In marathon meetings over the last week, Mr. Delatour said, the beleaguered Haitian government considered moving the capital to a new location. But he said it was agreed that doing so would take too long and cost too much.
 Instead, he said, officials intend to keep most government ministries close to the locations where they fell. He said, however, that some secondary services might be moved out of the downtown to address the chronic overcrowding and insecurity that has long plagued the area. 
 ''God didn't strike with a short-term plan and a long-term plan,'' Mr. Delatour said. ''He just hit like Muhammad Ali. One shot and we're lying on the mat.'' 
 He said the government would focus most of its attention on putting roofs back over people's heads. And in the meantime, he said, rebuilding businesses and public offices would allow the government and the private sector to put people to work. 
 ''Our motto is 'build back better,' '' he said. 
 In addition to the sheer magnitude of the physical task ahead, Mr. Delatour said that Haiti's recovery effort was challenged by the difficulty of coordinating the countless countries and humanitarian organizations eager to provide assistance. And he said it would not be easy for the government, with its long history of corruption, to win people's trust. 
 Rather than waiting for a government they are skeptical of to help them out of this crisis, Mr. Delatour said, Haitians of all classes have already begun their own recovery efforts. Port-au-Prince is bustling with work crews hired by those with means to clear away the rubble so they can begin rebuilding their homes or businesses. 
 Towns outside the capital have been flooded by earthquake victims in search of places to start new lives, stretching water, food and other essential resources dangerously thin. And the poorest of the poor have settled into makeshift camps across the city, many of them vowing not to move without credible assurances that the government intends to provide them with stable living arrangements. 
 ''Haitians have been managing their own survival for 200 years, so they're not waiting for the government,'' Mr. Delatour said. ''The government is playing catch-up.'' 
 In the back of everyone's mind here was a fear of the donor fatigue that typically sinks in when disasters stretch on too long. Haitian officials were eager to capitalize on the international outpouring of support by outlining their needs now.
 Mrs. Clinton declined to say how much the United States would provide in the long term. The donor nations' foreign ministers will meet again in March at the United Nations headquarters in New York.
 The one-day meeting in Montreal was not intended to map out a detailed plan for Haitian reconstruction. Instead its goal was to develop a structure for future, extended talks about the reconstruction.
 ''This conference is an initial, albeit critical, step on the long road to recovery,'' said Lawrence Cannon, the Canadian foreign minister. ''We need to identify with the Haitian government key priorities in order to define a road map of the tasks ahead.''

HEADLINE: New Hotel Brand Wants to Become a Grand Elysian

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
To prove that successful brands can be born in hard times, marketing historians point to examples like Fortune magazine and Snickers candy bars, both brought out in 1930; Diet Coke, introduced in 1982; and the iPod, which came out in October 2001.
 Hoping to join that list is the Elysian, a luxury hotel in the glitzy Gold Coast section of downtown Chicago. The name is meant to evoke French fashion design, and hotels, of the 1920s; think Coco Chanel at the Ritz. (Avenue des Champs-Elysees, after all, is ''Avenue of the Elysian Fields.'') 
 The Chicago office of Zig, an agency owned by MDC Partners, has worked with the developer of the Elysian, David C. Pisor, on creating an image for the new high-end brand in realms that range from signs on the construction site to print advertisements to coat-check tickets.
 The Elysian, which aspires to five-star status, had a low-key opening on Dec. 9 and its official opening on Jan. 6. There are 188 rooms and suites and ''most are quite large, north of 800 square feet,'' says Mr. Pisor, who is chief executive at Elysian Worldwide, based in Chicago. 
 The suggested rates are from $345 to $1,175 a night; the presidential suite goes for $6,000 a night.
 The Elysian occupies the first 26 stories of a 60-story building that cost $280 million and took seven years to develop. The remaining floors are home to 52 residences that average 4,000 square feet each, Mr. Pisor says, and all but 4 are sold.
 Needless to say, the idea of opening an opulent hotel under a name unfamiliar to travelers is not exactly the first thing on most people's to-do lists during the worst economic downturn since the Depression.
 ''I wish I was better at timing,'' Mr. Pisor acknowledges, but the Elysian is intended to be ''a special place.''
 ''Yes, you'll spend more than at a Westin,'' he adds, ''but the value you get is equal to the experience.''
 There are consumers still seeking upscale experiences in this economy, Mr. Pisor says, even if they will ''think harder'' about their purchases.
 ''They'll say, 'Do I want to spend this money?' and if they do, they'll be more judgmental about where they spend it,'' he adds.
 The goal, then, is to appeal to them with ''a more intimate-scale hotel,'' Mr. Pisor says, with ''half the number of keys of other five-star hotels in Chicago and more personalized service, more attention to detail.''
 ''We took the name Elysian from the Greek mythological place where the gods went to rest and took a break from managing human,'' he adds. ''That's what we'd like to represent: It's a special place to rest and have fun.''
 ''We want a hotel stay to be remarkable again like it was 100 years ago,'' Mr. Pisor says, in a facility that would seem ''less like a hotel and more like an estate.''
 To that end, 240 ''personable, approachable individuals'' were hired to staff the Elysian, he adds, and trained ''to be interactive with the guests'' in an environment that would ''not feel over-designed but comfortable.''
 Those thoughts are summarized in the headline of a print ad from the Zig Chicago office: ''Some say travel is not what it used to be. We look forward to proving otherwise.''
 ''Once, hotels were synonymous with a style of life as it should be lived,'' the text begins. ''Today, one of those landmarks stands at the corner of Rush and Walton.''
 Mr. Pisor turned to Zig because he had worked with the executives there when they were at a previous agency.
 ''I just like how they think,'' he says, and they were able to take his concept and direction for the new Elysian brand ''and give it life, make it breathe.'' Mr. Pisor estimates that the marketing budget is in the range of $3 million to $4 million.
 Steve Carli, managing director at the Zig Chicago office, picks up the story from there.
 ''We talked about what luxury means today,'' Mr. Carli says, ''true luxury and the people who could truly afford it.''
 ''They will still value, and pay for, experiences that are unique and remarkable,'' he adds, ''something you'd tell someone about, that you'd convey through word of mouth.''
 ''That's the only way someone will pay a premium to stay at a hotel like this instead of the Four Seasons or the Peninsula,'' Mr. Carli says.
 An inspiration, he recalls, came from an Italian poet, Cesare Pavese, who wrote, ''We don't remember days; we remember moments.''
 From that grew a belief that the unique experiences desired by the target market could be delivered in the form of ''understated, comfortable'' moments in the ''warm, genuine'' spirit of Chicago hospitality, Mr. Carli says -- moments that are ''not staged, not overdone,'' and would inspire guests to respond by saying, ''I love this small touch, and I'll remember this.''
 So the coat checks in the hotel's public spaces bear the words ''Stay awhile'' and the baggage tags declare, ''We will treat your luggage as if it is our own.''
 Bookmarks provided to guests in their rooms read, ''Hold that thought ...'' The comment cards they receive as they leave ask, ''Where has the time gone?'' and start off, ''I would just like to tell you ... ''
 And where such cards typically let guests reply ''Yes'' or ''No'' when asked if they would return to the hotel, the Elysian comment card offers three choices: ''Absolutely,'' ''Perhaps'' and ''No.'' 
 The hotel's Web site, also produced by the Zig Chicago office, speaks in the same voice. As the home page loads, these discreet words appear: ''One moment please''; they are followed by a scene of the wind carrying flower petals across a courtyard and then the front desk and lobby of the Elysian.
 The philosophy of the Elysian brand is also outlined in a book from Zig, ''The Found Art of Hospitality,'' that is distributed to the hotel's ownership, management and current and potential employees.
 The book, subtitled ''The Joy of Creating Remarkable Moments for Others,'' begins by asking, ''Is a mint on a pillow really a sign of hospitality?''
 ''Today, decidedly less so,'' the text replies. ''Because a mint on a pillow has become such a cliche that it is no longer seen as a genuine expression of kindness.''
 ''Instead, like many gestures within the hotel industry, it has become one more inauthentic procedure,'' the text continues, ''carried out not because it is something hotels want to do, but because it is something they feel they have to do.''
 ''Which leads us to wonder: When did the hospitality industry become inhospitable?'' the text asks, then presents the Elysian's mission statement, courtesy of Mr. Pisor, that ''we strive to create the world's most remarkable hotel experiences.''
 ''To some, the mission statement may sound a little bold,'' the text says. ''And perhaps it is, but we are confident it is completely achievable. We believe this for one simple reason: at the Elysian, every employee is empowered to create remarkable moments for each guest.''
 That approach is underlined by an ''employee pop quiz'' about what to do when a guest walks into the lobby wearing a long coat. The employee is asked to select one of three right answers.
 The right answer, it turns out, is ''We do not know,'' because,the book advises, ''we suggest doing whatever feels most appropriate for the guest.'' 
 The book offers a couple of examples. Several days after a housekeeper notices that a guest left an issue of Us Weekly on the nightstand, she leaves the next issue atop the old. And a front-desk employee who notices when checking in a guest that his birthday falls during his stay arranges for a cake and a bottle of wine to be left in his room on the birthday.
 The book ends with a small card tucked inside an envelope affixed to the last page. The card asks, in silver letters on a white field, ''Have you made someone's visit remarkable today?''
 The thought is, 'Let's give this person the latitude and they'll do the right thing,' '' Mr. Carli says. ''We're trying to communicate, 'There are wonderful things you can do to make it a wonderful experience' '' for the hotel's guests.
 ''At four or five hundred bucks, they'll ask for a lot,'' he adds of the guests. ''We want to make when they leave they're not wanting for anything.''
 As encompassing as the service is meant to be, the Elysian brand also means ''sometime, pull back a bit,'' Mr. Carli says, and just let a napkin be a napkin rather than a device to help burnish the brand image.
 Mr. Pisor says he agrees with that decision.
 ''We've tried to understate the brand,'' he says. ''It's meant to be there, but not in your face, and we didn't do as many logos in the rooms or around the property'' as had initially been planned.
 Mr. Pisor describes himself as pleased with the early response to the hotel.
 ''So far, so good,'' he says. ''We've gotten a lot of guest comment cards and we got lots of 'Absolutelys.' ''
 ''And we're getting a lot of people keeping our room key cards,'' he adds, rather than turning them in when they check out.

HEADLINE: A Payroll Tax Break for Jobs

BYLINE: By CHARLES E. SCHUMER and ORRIN G. HATCH. 
Charles E. Schumer is a Democratic senator from New York. Orrin G. Hatch is a Republican senator from Utah.

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
 WITH the national unemployment rate at 10 percent, and more than 15 million Americans looking for work, ideas to spur job creation are at the forefront of everyone's minds. While we may represent different political philosophies, we recognize that high unemployment -- particularly long-term unemployment -- is not a liberal problem or a conservative problem; it's a national problem that takes a huge toll on families. 
 The idea for some sort of jobs tax credit is percolating again, but the jobs credit that existed in the late 1970s was of limited success, and it was excruciatingly complicated. Recalling this experience, members of Congress from both parties have been lukewarm to such a credit, and the idea was dropped from the stimulus package last year. 
 We have an idea that is simple, straightforward and easy to explain and administer. In fact, it is so simple that the legislative text of the proposal is only a few pages long -- a rarity when it comes to tax policy. 
 Here's the idea: Starting immediately after enactment, any private-sector employer that hires a worker who had been unemployed for at least 60 days will not have to pay its 6.2 percent Social Security payroll tax on that employee for the duration of 2010. The Social Security trust fund will then be made whole with spending cuts elsewhere in the budget between now and 2015. That's it. Simple to understand, and easy to explain. 
 The beauty of this proposal goes beyond its simplicity. Unlike a jobs tax credit of a specific dollar amount, this credit is ''front-loaded'' in that it provides an incentive for businesses to hire workers earlier in the year -- because the tax benefit will be greater. A $60,000 worker hired on Feb. 1 will save a business about $3,400 in taxes, while that same worker hired on May 1 will save it about $2,500. 
 Unlike some versions of a payroll-tax holiday, which provide a much bigger benefit for higher-paid workers, this proposal is not biased toward either low-wage or high-wage workers. Yes, if you pay people more, you save more in taxes -- but the savings as a percentage of pay remains constant. Under this plan, a business saves 6.2 percent on both a $40,000 worker and a $90,000 worker. 
 In the current environment, no business wants to wait until 2011 to receive a tax credit for someone it hires today. Another obvious benefit of this proposal to forgive payroll taxes is that it keeps money in a business's pockets, since the tax is simply not collected in the first place. 
 In addition, because the benefit starts on the date of hiring and does not have an arbitrary cap, more businesses will want to use it. And since it is an elimination of the employer's share of the Social Security tax for these workers -- rather than a fixed or capped dollar amount -- the complexities of making the incentive work with a firm's payroll software are greatly reduced because employers will know simply to zero out the tax for these workers. 
 To promote long-term employment as the recovery gains steam, we would also add the following bonus: For any eligible employee kept on payroll for a continuous 52 weeks, the employer would receive an additional $1,000 credit on its 2011 tax return. (This would apply to any worker hired in 2010.)
 Our two-pronged approach would be a far more efficient use of taxpayer dollars than other proposals under discussion, all of which could cost many times more with very little guaranteed improvement in unemployment. 
 Imagine that three million unemployed workers were to be hired this year under our plan. If they all worked an average of six months in 2010 at a salary of $50,000, and every single one stayed on payroll for 52 consecutive weeks into 2011, the gross cost of the Social Security tax cut and the additional credit would be only $7.6 billion. And that's before we consider the offsets from income and payroll taxes paid by these workers. 
 There are some additional rules that would have to be put in place. For example, eligible workers would have to be hired for a minimum of 30 hours per week, and workers who are family members of the employer would not be eligible. The payroll tax reduction would be for private-sector jobs only; new jobs that are created by tax dollars in the first place would not be eligible. And any employer with a lower total payroll in 2010 than it had in 2009 would have to forfeit the benefit -- businesses shouldn't be allowed to shed jobs and still receive a tax benefit. 
 We urge Congress and President Obama to consider this idea to help jumpstart hiring and turn our focus back on jobs.

HEADLINE: Wind Power Grows 39% For the Year

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
Despite a crippling recession and tight credit markets, the American wind power industry grew at a blistering pace in 2009, adding 39 percent more capacity. The country is close to the point where 2 percent of its electricity will come from wind turbines.
 While that is still a small share, it is up from virtually nothing a few years ago. Continued growth at such a fast pace could help the nation lower its emissions of the gases that cause global warming. 
 The American Wind Energy Association, in its annual report to be released on Tuesday, said the amount of capacity added last year, 9,900 megawatts, was the largest on record, and was 18 percent above the capacity added in 2008, also a banner year.
 The group said the growth of wind power was helped by the federal stimulus package that passed a year ago, which extended a tax credit and provided other investment incentives for the industry.
 But the group warned that the growth could slow. Much of the wind development in 2009 was caused by momentum from 2008, as huge turbines ordered then were delivered to wind farms. In 2009, the recession idled many manufacturers and new orders weakened, which could portend an installation slowdown this year.
 ''The U.S. wind industry shattered all installation records in 2009, and this was directly attributable to the lifeline that was provided by the stimulus package,'' said Denise Bode, the trade association's chief executive. ''The second half of the year was extraordinary. But manufacturers didn't see much growth because they had built up so much inventory.''
 About as much new power-generating capacity came from wind as from natural gas last year, Ms. Bode said. Together, new wind and natural gas projects accounted for about 80 percent of all new generating capacity added in the country. 
 The wind industry has undergone rapid growth in recent years. Since 2002, the country's installed base of wind turbines has jumped almost sevenfold.
 Even so, the American industry has lagged behind Europe, which gets about 5 percent of its electricity from wind. The European Commission has set an ambitious mandate to achieve 20 percent of electrical production from wind and other renewable sources by 2020. Denmark has essentially achieved that goal already, and sometimes produces more wind power than it can use.
 Last year, China also outlined plans to more than double the country's wind capacity by the end of this year by investing $14.6 billion, with rapid growth planned through the end of the decade.
 Concerns about global warming have sparked interest in renewable power in the United States and spurred the creation of a domestic manufacturing industry that now employs 85,000 people. Today, about half the components used in wind farms are made in the United States, compared with 25 percent in 2004, the trade group said. 
 Much of the growth is attributable to state laws that mandate that a portion of the local power come from renewable sources. But many hurdles remain in getting to 10 or 20 percent wind power nationally.
 Wind investors have called for long-distance transmission lines between the nation's wind-intensive regions, mostly in the Great Plains and Texas, and its biggest population centers, mostly on the coasts. The lack of such transmission is seen as a major obstacle to further expansion.
 ''It is not a question of lack of resources,'' said Tim Stephure, an analyst at Emerging Energy Research, a consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass. ''Unlike the federal highway system or the national gas system, there is a huge lack of federal oversight for electricity. This is something that will take time, while the need for the industry is now.'' 
 Still, the potential for wind is enormous. Mr. Stephure said that by 2020, wind's installed capacity could be five times higher than it is today, reaching about 180,000 megawatts.
 The industry has also called on Congress to pass a federal mandate requiring that a certain percentage of power come from renewable sources. Such mandates are already in place throughout the European Union and in China. In the United States, 29 states have adopted such a renewable power standard.
 ''The wind manufacturing sector has the potential to employ many more Americans in green jobs, but without a renewable electricity standard to provide a long-term market, the sector will be slow to grow,'' the trade group said in its report.
 The nation's wind turbines generate enough electricity to power the equivalent of 9.7 million homes, according to the report. Last year, Texas consolidated its lead as the nation's top wind producer, with a total capacity of 9,410 megawatts, about three times more than the second-largest producer, Iowa. They were followed by California, Washington and Minnesota.

HEADLINE: Colleges Marketing Easy Sell to Applicants: No Fee and No Essay

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG

DATELINE: RICHMOND, Va. 

 BODY:
Over the last few years, the tiny College of Saint Rose in Albany has seen applications increase at least 25 percent annually, minority admissions rise and its standing in the U.S. News and World Report rankings climb more than 20 rungs.
 Its secret? Lifting a page from the marketing playbook of credit card companies.
 Last fall the college sent out 30,000 bright red ''Exclusive Scholar Applications'' to high school seniors that promised to waive the $40 application fee, invited them to skip the dreaded essay and assured a decision in three weeks. Because the application arrived with the students' names and other information already filled in, applying required little more than a signature.
 More than 100 other colleges and universities paid the same marketing company to send out variations of these fast-track applications last fall, more than a five-fold jump since 2006. Some have spent upward of $1 million on their application campaigns, and many have seen their applicant pools double or even triple in the last two years. 
 Theirs is a roster that includes well-known institutions like Marquette (which promised a free baseball cap to the first 250 respondents to its ''Advantage Application''); Rensselaer Polytechnic (the ''Candidate's Choice Application'') and the University of Minnesota (''the Golden Gopher Fast Application''). Others that have regional reputations -- like the University of the Pacific in Stockton, Calif. (the ''Distinctive Candidate Application'') -- are hoping to raise their national profiles.
 While some guidance counselors say they welcome the elimination of application fees -- which can be as much as $50 per college -- they worry that the express applications may be short-circuiting a storied process in which students search out the colleges that might be the best fit for them. 
 The counselors also fear that recipients of the applications are being lulled into thinking they have been pre-approved for admittance. In fact, Marquette, with a freshman class of about 1,950, sent out about 40,000 of its ''Advantage'' applications last year, and will reject about 40 percent of its applicants over all.
 Asked about the proliferation of such mailings, Robert Bardwell, a college counselor at Monson High School in western Massachusetts, said: ''It's disheartening that schools have to resort to this. I think they're dealing with teenagers who don't know what they want. I worry that they are applying just because it's free, rather than that they think this might be the school for them.''
 It is no coincidence that these marketing campaigns are similar to those in the financial and political worlds. Royall & Company, which designed and sent out most of these application packets from its offices in Richmond, employs several veterans from the direct mail campaigns of long-distance phone providers and banks. 
 And its founder, Bill Royall, is a former political strategist who played a lead role in a mailing sent to tens of thousands of donors to Bill Clinton's presidential campaign, hours after he accepted the Democratic Party nomination in July 1992.
 The rise in short-cut applications appears to have two main causes. One is the fractured economy, which has left some colleges scrambling just to fill their freshman classes and to identify applicants who can pay full tuition. But there is also U.S. News and World Report, which puts a premium on big jumps in applications, as well as in applicants' standardized test scores, in assembling its annual rankings.
 Royall helps each college identify potential applicants by buying lists of high school students' names and addresses from the College Board, based on how they performed on the PSAT or SAT, or on information they provided on their high school class rank, interests or ethnicity.
 To Royall and its clients, the subsequent outreach helps students who might not know that a particular college exists. Moreover, the company argues that it is saving applicants precious time at a hectic moment in their lives. (Some colleges' fast-track applications, for example, encourage students to submit a graded high school paper in lieu of an original essay.)
 ''People might say this is too easy, it isn't rigorous enough,'' Mr. Royall said. ''No one has ever told us that the people applying using these methods are less qualified.''
 Mr. Royall said that no college had ever mentioned climbing the U.S. News rankings as a goal. Instead, he said, most engaged his firm because they hoped to increase the quality and diversity of their applicant pools. And the strategy appears to work.
 Eduardo Garnica, 19, of Sacramento, said he had expected to attend the University of California, Davis, until he received a ''Distinctive Candidate'' application from the University of the Pacific, 50 miles away in Stockton. 
 ''I hadn't been that interested in going there,'' he said. ''But they made it easy.''
 Mr. Garnica said he had been captivated immediately by the words ''Waived application fee'' and ''No required essay!'' on the bright orange envelope. Inside, a cover letter congratulated him for having ''earned an opportunity that is reserved for only a select few high-priority students.'' (In truth, he was one of 30,000 who got the letter.)
 He said he was flattered enough to visit, liked what he saw and was later accepted. He enrolled as a freshman this past fall.
 Mr. Garnica said he was enjoying the university so much that he was willing to forgive a white lie in its marketing campaign -- there is no application fee for anyone applying to Pacific, and thus no fee to waive.
 Similarly, Matthew Buck, a 17-year-old high school senior at Monson High School in Massachusetts, whose counselor is Mr. Bardwell, said he had applied this year to York College in Pennsylvania, Wells College in New York, and Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts, largely because they sent him fast-track applications. 
 ''It was free,'' Mr. Buck said. ''I had nothing to lose.'' He added, ''If they're willing to consider me, then I'll definitely consider them.''
 Mary Grondahl, vice president of enrollment management at the College of Saint Rose, said she started working with Royall several years ago at least partly to broaden the college's reach beyond the state's capitol region and to encourage more young men to apply. 
 Last year, it paid Royall about $120,000, or $4 per application.
 The college credits the company, in large part, for helping increase the percentage of men in last year's entering freshman class to 35 percent, from 28 percent less than a decade ago. 
 Meanwhile, the number of enrolled students who hailed from outside the Albany region has increased to 63 percent, a 10-percentage-point gain from just a few years earlier, while the percentage of students who identified themselves as African-American, Asian or Hispanic, rose to 18 percent, from 7 percent, Ms. Grondahl said. Over all, applications climbed to more than 4,000 for the class of about 600 that enrolled in September.
 Asked to fix a value on the campaign, Ms. Grondahl said, ''It was almost like the MasterCard ad says: priceless.''

HEADLINE: The Populist Addiction

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Politics, some believe, is the organization of hatreds. The people who try to divide society on the basis of ethnicity we call racists. The people who try to divide it on the basis of religion we call sectarians. The people who try to divide it on the basis of social class we call either populists or elitists.
 These two attitudes -- populism and elitism -- seem different, but they're really mirror images of one another. They both assume a country fundamentally divided. They both describe politics as a class struggle between the enlightened and the corrupt, the pure and the betrayers. 
 Both attitudes will always be with us, but these days populism is in vogue. The Republicans have their populists. Sarah Palin has been known to divide the country between the real Americans and the cultural elites. And the Democrats have their populists. Since the defeat in Massachusetts, many Democrats have apparently decided that their party has to mimic the rhetoric of John Edwards's presidential campaign. They've taken to dividing the country into two supposedly separate groups -- real Americans who live on Main Street and the insidious interests of Wall Street.
 It's easy to see why politicians would be drawn to the populist pose. First, it makes everything so simple. The economic crisis was caused by a complex web of factors, including global imbalances caused by the rise of China. But with the populist narrative, you can just blame Goldman Sachs.
 Second, it absolves voters of responsibility for their problems. Over the past few years, many investment bankers behaved like idiots, but so did average Americans, racking up unprecedented levels of personal debt. With the populist narrative, you can accuse the former and absolve the latter.
 Third, populism is popular with the ruling class. Ever since I started covering politics, the Democratic ruling class has been driven by one fantasy: that voters will get so furious at people with M.B.A.'s that they will hand power to people with Ph.D.'s. The Republican ruling class has been driven by the fantasy that voters will get so furious at people with Ph.D.'s that they will hand power to people with M.B.A.'s. Members of the ruling class love populism because they think it will help their section of the elite gain power.
 So it's easy to see the seductiveness of populism. Nonetheless, it nearly always fails. The history of populism, going back to William Jennings Bryan, is generally a history of defeat.
 That's because voters aren't as stupid as the populists imagine. Voters are capable of holding two ideas in their heads at one time: First, that the rich and the powerful do rig the game in their own favor; and second, that simply bashing the rich and the powerful will still not solve the country's problems.
 Political populists never get that second point. They can't seem to grasp that a politics based on punishing the elites won't produce a better-educated work force, more investment, more innovation or any of the other things required for progress and growth.
 In fact, this country was built by anti-populists. It was built by people like Alexander Hamilton and Abraham Lincoln who rejected the idea that the national economy is fundamentally divided along class lines. They rejected the zero-sum mentality that is at the heart of populism, the belief that economics is a struggle over finite spoils. Instead, they believed in a united national economy -- one interlocking system of labor, trade and investment.
 Hamilton championed capital markets and Lincoln championed banks, not because they loved traders and bankers. They did it because they knew a vibrant capitalist economy would maximize opportunity for poor boys like themselves. They were willing to tolerate the excesses of traders because they understood that no institution is more likely to channel opportunity to new groups and new people than vigorous financial markets.
 In their view, government's role was not to side with one faction or to wage class war. It was to rouse the energy and industry of people at all levels. It was to enhance competition and make it fair -- to make sure that no group, high or low, is able to erect barriers that would deprive Americans of an open field and a fair chance. Theirs was a philosophy that celebrated development, mobility and work, wherever those things might be generated.
 The populists have an Us versus Them mentality. If they continue their random attacks on enterprise and capital, they will only increase the pervasive feeling of uncertainty, which is now the single biggest factor in holding back investment, job creation and growth. They will end up discrediting good policies (the Obama bank reforms are quite sensible) because they will persuade the country that the government is in the hands of reckless Huey Longs.
 They will have traded dynamic optimism, which always wins, for combative divisiveness, which always loses.

HEADLINE: Obama's Credibility Gap

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
Who is Barack Obama?
 Americans are still looking for the answer, and if they don't get it soon -- or if they don't like the answer -- the president's current political problems will look like a walk in the park.
 Mr. Obama may be personally very appealing, but he has positioned himself all over the political map: the anti-Iraq war candidate who escalated the war in Afghanistan; the opponent of health insurance mandates who made a mandate to buy insurance the centerpiece of his plan; the president who stocked his administration with Wall Street insiders and went to the mat for the banks and big corporations, but who is now trying to present himself as a born-again populist. 
 Mr. Obama is in danger of being perceived as someone whose rhetoric, however skillful, cannot always be trusted. He is creating a credibility gap for himself, and if it widens much more he won't be able to close it.
 Mr. Obama's campaign mantra was ''change'' and most of his supporters took that to mean that he would change the way business was done in Washington and that he would reverse the disastrous economic policies that favored mega-corporations and the very wealthy at the expense of the middle class and the poor.
 ''Tonight, more Americans are out of work, and more are working harder for less,'' said Mr. Obama in his acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention in August 2008. ''More of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet. More of you have cars you can't afford to drive, credit card bills you can't afford to pay, and tuition that's beyond your reach.''
 Voters watching the straight-arrow candidate delivering that speech, in the midst of the worst economic crisis since the Depression, would not logically have thought that an obsessive focus on health insurance would trump job creation as the top domestic priority of an Obama administration.
 But that's what happened. Moreover, questions were raised about Mr. Obama's candor when he spoke about health care. In his acceptance speech, for example, candidate Obama took a verbal shot at John McCain, sharply criticizing him for offering ''a health care plan that would actually tax people's benefits.''
 Now Mr. Obama favors a plan that would tax at least some people's benefits. Mr. Obama also repeatedly said that policyholders who were pleased with their plans and happy with their doctors would be able to keep both under his reform proposals. 
 Well, that wasn't necessarily so, as the president eventually acknowledged. There would undoubtedly be changes in some people's coverage as a result of ''reform,'' and some of those changes would be substantial. At a forum sponsored by ABC News last summer, Mr. Obama backed off of his frequent promise that no changes would occur, saying only that ''if you are happy with your plan, and if you are happy with your doctor, we don't want you to have to change.''
 These less-than-candid instances are emblematic of much bigger problems. Mr. Obama promised during the campaign that he would be a different kind of president, one who would preside over a more open, more high-minded administration that would be far more in touch with the economic needs of ordinary working Americans. But no sooner was he elected than he put together an economic team that would protect, above all, the interests of Wall Street, the pharmaceutical industry, the health insurance companies, and so on.
 How can you look out for the interests of working people with Tim Geithner whispering in one ear and Larry Summers in the other? 
 Now with his poll numbers down and the Democrats' filibuster-proof margin in the Senate about to vanish, Mr. Obama is trying again to position himself as a champion of the middle class. Suddenly, with the public appalled at the scandalous way the health care legislation was put together, and with Democrats facing a possible debacle in the fall, Mr. Obama is back in campaign mode. Every other utterance is about ''fighting'' for the middle class, ''fighting'' for jobs, ''fighting'' against the big bad banks.
 The president who has been aloof and remote and a pushover for the health insurance and pharmaceutical industries, who has been locked in the troubling embrace of the Geithners and Summers and Ben Bernankes of the world, all of a sudden is a man of the people. But even as he is promising to fight for jobs, a very expensive proposition, he's proposing a spending freeze that can only hurt job-creating efforts.
 Mr. Obama will deliver his State of the Union address Wednesday night. The word is that he will offer some small bore assistance to the middle class. But more important than the content of this speech will be whether the president really means what he says. Americans want to know what he stands for, where his line in the sand is, what he'll really fight for, and where he wants to lead this nation.
 They want to know who their president really is.

HEADLINE: Massachusetts Victory Buoys Republican Hopes in Illinois

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
Republicans in Illinois hold no statewide offices, are minorities in both chambers of the State Legislature and struggle some years to recruit viable candidates even at the top of the ballot.
 But the election last week of a long-shot Republican, Scott Brown, to the Senate in Massachusetts, a similarly blue state, has invigorated Republicans here. 
 Next Tuesday's statewide primaries -- the first in the nation this year -- have suddenly turned into a pep rally for November and could provide a window into what is to come nationally as the 2010 primary season unfolds.
 ''Illinois is next,'' said Pat Brady, chairman of the state Republican Party. ''The political environment is worse here for Democrats than it was in Massachusetts.'' 
 Representative Mark Steven Kirk, the front-runner in the Republican primary for the Senate seat once held by President Obama, has even taken to echoing Mr. Brown's campaign remarks.
 ''No one should make the mistake by calling this the Obama seat,'' he said in an interview. ''This is the seat of the people of Illinois.'' 
 Democratic leaders here discount direct comparisons to Massachusetts -- for starters, the race there was a special election, not a primary -- and point out distinctions in this state's candidates, voting blocs and alliances. And perhaps most of all, they mention their sense that Illinois voters still carry a special allegiance to Mr. Obama.
 Still, the message from Massachusetts is resounding among Democrats, too (in interviews, several candidates quickly proclaimed themselves ''outsiders''). The party is trying to hold on to the Senate seat, the governor's mansion and a few House seats that Republicans say they are especially confident about winning.
 A televised forum last week among the three top Democrats in the Senate race seemed to become a scuffle over which one would be the least likely, come November, to lose in an upset similar to the one in Massachusetts. (Along the way, they struck notes that made them sound not so unlike Mr. Brown.) 
 One candidate, Cheryle Jackson, who led the Chicago Urban League, said the Massachusetts vote had reflected the lack of jobs and the suffering of people -- ''precisely,'' she added, ''the reason I have decided to run.'' 
 And another candidate, David Hoffman, a former inspector general for the City of Chicago, offered this pitch for himself as a way to dodge a Massachusetts outcome: ''We need to make sure that we have a nominee who is as independent as possible.''
 Some argue that Mr. Kirk, as a five-term congressman and a moderate Republican with centrist-leaning views that have irked conservatives, may not benefit from voter unrest. (Democrats also have their eyes on his House district in Chicago's northern suburbs.)
 ''In a key way, Illinois is Massachusetts in reverse,'' said Kathleen Strand, a senior adviser to Illinois for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. ''Here, the Republican candidate is the Washington insider that voters are angry at, not the Democrat.''
 In the view of some conservatives, Mr. Kirk, who supports abortion rights, fits right in with the Democratic candidates. They say that while he might gain unhappy Democratic voters and center-leaning independents, he will lose the votes of a different segment -- some who consider themselves part of the Tea Party movement, abortion opponents and others. 
 Conservatives often cite Mr. Kirk's vote in favor of cap-and-trade legislation intended to reduce carbon emissions; he has since reversed course, criticizing the legislation and saying he would vote against it as a senator. They also do not appreciate what they see as his effort to swerve to the right; some mocked his campaign for trying to win supportive words from former Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska when she was in Chicago recently.
 ''Mark Kirk has absolutely no Tea Party support,'' said Diane Benjamin, an organizer of a Tea Party group in McLean County, about 90 miles southwest of Chicago.
 In the primary, there are several lesser-known candidates, including Patrick Hughes, who has drawn praise from some conservatives and Tea Party supporters (though not Ms. Benjamin). But analysts say that opposition to Mr. Kirk has not amounted to a movement unified and motivated enough to defeat him; a Chicago Tribune poll released on Monday showed Mr. Kirk with a wide lead in the primary race. (Of those Republicans polled who said they agreed with the Tea Party movement, 48 percent favored Mr. Kirk, the newspaper said.)
 Some of the turmoil here is particular to Illinois. This is the first election for governor since Rod R. Blagojevich, a Democrat, was ousted after prosecutors charged him with secretly trying to sell the Senate seat that is now up for grabs. Senator Roland W. Burris, whom Mr. Blagojevich appointed to the seat, announced months ago that he would not run for election.
 Democrats are queasy (and Republicans giddy) over the spectacle of Mr. Blagojevich's federal corruption trial, which is scheduled to begin here in June, the middle of campaign season.
 Gov. Patrick J. Quinn, the lieutenant governor who was elevated to the state's top job in the aftermath of the scandal, and Dan Hynes, the state comptroller, who is from a longtime Chicago political family, are battling in the Democratic primary for governor. 
 The Republican field is vast and relatively strong, in part, as one political analyst here said, because they ''see blood in the water.'' The Republicans include Andy McKenna, former chairman of the state Republican Party; Jim Ryan, a former state attorney general; and two state senators, Kirk Dillard and Bill Brady.
 The economy is a theme heard everywhere, but it is more pronounced here in every race. Residents complain about vanishing jobs (the state unemployment rate, at 11.1 percent, is higher than the nation's), and the state's failure to fix its budget, which has a deficit that some estimate at $13 billion. Illinois is failing to pay all sorts of bills and has $80 billion in unfunded pension liabilities, signs some experts cite when they put the state in a class not so distinct from California. 
 ''What we learned is that voters are incredibly angry,'' said Alexi Giannoulias, the state treasurer and a friend of the president who, according to Monday's Tribune poll, holds a double-digit lead over other Democrats vying for the Senate seat. (Mr. Obama has made no endorsement in the primary.) 
 ''They're angry at what's happening with our economy, with our lack of jobs,'' Mr. Giannoulias said. ''They're angry because they feel like they're being ignored by Washington, D.C. -- ignored by Democrats and Republicans.''
 Politics in Illinois was not always overrun by Democrats. When Mr. Blagojevich was elected in 2002 (after a scandal that sent the Republican governor to prison), he was the first Democrat in the job in three decades. By the mid-2000s, the picture had become lopsided enough that Peter G. Fitzgerald, the state's most recent Republican senator, announced that he would not seek re-election, noting that Illinois had become a ''staunchly Democratic state.'' 
 It is hard to know exactly how many of the state's 7.5 million registered voters consider themselves Democrats or Republicans because voters do not register by party here; still, estimates from both sides say Democrats outnumber Republicans.
 But at Democratic campaign events, ordinary voters say Mr. Obama remains enormously popular. The loudest complaint is that he does not come home enough. Yet some said they believed that people, even here, might separate their feelings about him from their frustration with Washington.
 ''After Massachusetts, you can't be sure of anything,'' said Doris Conant, 84, a Democrat from Chicago. ''I hope it mobilizes people to get out and support their candidate. If we lose the Obama seat, it would be heartbreaking.''

HEADLINE: Obama to Seek Spending Freeze To Trim Deficits

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES; David M. Herszenhorn contributed reporting from Washington.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama will call for a three-year freeze in spending on many domestic programs, and for increases no greater than inflation after that, an initiative intended to signal his seriousness about cutting the budget deficit, administration officials said Monday. 
 The officials said the proposal would be a major component both of Mr. Obama's State of the Union address on Wednesday and of the budget he will send to Congress on Monday for the fiscal year that begins in October.
 The freeze would cover the agencies and programs for which Congress allocates specific budgets each year, including air traffic control, farm subsidies, education, nutrition and national parks. 
 But it would exempt security-related budgets for the Pentagon, foreign aid, the Veterans Administration and homeland security, as well as the entitlement programs that make up the biggest and fastest-growing part of the federal budget: Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. 
 The payoff in budget savings would be small relative to the deficit: The estimated $250 billion in savings over 10 years would be less than 3 percent of the roughly $9 trillion in additional deficits the government is expected to accumulate over that time.
 The initiative holds political risks as well as potential benefits. Because Mr. Obama plans to exempt military spending while leaving many popular domestic programs vulnerable, his move is certain to further anger liberals in his party and senior Democrats in Congress, who are already upset by the possible collapse of health care legislation and the troop buildup in Afghanistan, among other things. 
 Fiscally conservative Democrats in the House and Senate have urged Mr. Obama to support a freeze, and it would suggest to voters, Wall Street and other nations that the president is willing to make tough decisions at a time when the deficit and the national debt, in the view of many economists, have reached levels that undermine the nation's long-term prosperity. Perceptions that government spending is out of control have contributed to Mr. Obama's loss of support among independent voters, and concern about the government's fiscal health could put upward pressure on the interest rates the United States has to pay to borrow money from investors and nations, especially China, that have been financing Washington's budget deficit.
 Republicans were quick to mock the freeze proposal. ''Given Washington Democrats' unprecedented spending binge, this is like announcing you're going on a diet after winning a pie-eating contest,'' said Michael Steel, a spokesman for the House Republican leader, Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio. 
 The spending reductions that would be required would have to be agreed to by Congress, and it is not clear how much support Mr. Obama will get in an election year when the political appeal of greater fiscal responsibility will be vying with the pressure to provide voters with more and better services. The administration officials said the part of the budget they have singled out -- $447 billion in domestic programs -- amounts to a relatively small share, about one-eighth, of the overall federal budget. 
 But given the raft of agencies and programs within that slice, the reductions will mean painful reductions that will be fought by numerous lobbies and constituent groups. And not all programs will be frozen, the administration officials said; many will be cut well below a freeze or eliminated to provide increases for programs that are higher priorities for the administration in areas like education, energy, the environment and health.
 The balancing act of picking winners and losers was evident on Monday at the White House. Mr. Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. outlined a number of new proposals that will be in the budget to help the middle class. They cover issues including child care, student loans and retirement savings.
 Administration officials also are working with Congress on roughly $150 billion in additional stimulus spending and tax cuts to spur job creation. But much of that spending would be authorized in the current fiscal year, the officials said, so it would not be affected by the proposed freeze that would take effect in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. 
 It is the growth in the so-called entitlement programs -- Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security -- that is the major factor behind projections of unsustainably high deficits, because of rapidly rising health costs and an aging population.
 But one administration official said that limiting the much smaller discretionary domestic budget would have symbolic value. That spending includes lawmakers' earmarks for parochial projects, and only when the public believes such perceived waste is being wrung out will they be willing to consider reductions in popular entitlement programs, the official said.
 ''By helping to create a new atmosphere of fiscal discipline, it can actually also feed into debates over other components of the budget,'' the official said, briefing reporters on the condition of anonymity.
 The administration officials did not identify which programs Mr. Obama would cut or eliminate, but said that information would be in the budget he submits next week. For the coming fiscal year, the reductions would be $10 billion to $15 billion, they said. Last year Mr. Obama proposed to cut a similar amount -- $11.5 billion -- and Congress approved about three-fifths of that, the officials said.
 The federal government's discretionary domestic spending has grown about 5 percent on average since 1993, according to the administration. It spiked to about 27 percent from 2008 to 2009, however, because of the recession. The sudden increase reflected both the first outlays from the $787 billion stimulus package as well as automatic spending for unemployment compensation and food stamps that is triggered during an economic downturn. 
 The freeze that Mr. Obama will propose for the fiscal years 2011 through 2013 actually means a cut in real terms, since the affected spending would not keep pace with inflation.
 According to the administration, by 2015 that share of the federal budget will be at its lowest level in a half-century relative to the size of the economy. 
 ''A lot of our caucus won't like it but I don't think we have any choice,'' said an adviser to Congressional Democratic leaders, who would only speak on condition of anonymity about internal party deliberations. ''After Massachusetts and all the polls about independents' abandoning us for being fiscally irresponsible, we can't afford to be spending more than Obama.'' 
 While the Democrats' unexpected loss of a Massachusetts Senate seat in a special election last week gave new impetus to administration efforts to tackle the deficit, those efforts actually have been under way since last fall, when officials began early work on the 2011 budget.
 Mr. Obama's budget director, Peter R. Orszag, initially directed Cabinet secretaries and agency heads to propose alternative budgets -- one with a freeze and another that cut spending by 5 percent. Months of internal arguments and appeals followed.

HEADLINE: In Digital Combat, U.S. Finds No Easy Deterrent

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF, DAVID E. SANGER and THOM SHANKER

 BODY:
This article was reported by John Markoff,David E. Sanger and Thom Shanker, and written byMr. Sanger.
 WASHINGTON -- On a Monday morning earlier this month, top Pentagon leaders gathered to simulate how they would respond to a sophisticated cyberattack aimed at paralyzing the nation's power grids, its communications systems or its financial networks.
 The results were dispiriting. The enemy had all the advantages: stealth, anonymity and unpredictability. No one could pinpoint the country from which the attack came, so there was no effective way to deter further damage by threatening retaliation. What's more, the military commanders noted that they even lacked the legal authority to respond -- especially because it was never clear if the attack was an act of vandalism, an attempt at commercial theft or a state-sponsored effort to cripple the United States, perhaps as a prelude to a conventional war.
 What some participants in the simulation knew -- and others did not -- was that a version of their nightmare had just played out in real life, not at the Pentagon where they were meeting, but in the far less formal war rooms at Google Inc. Computers at Google and more than 30 other companies had been penetrated, and Google's software engineers quickly tracked the source of the attack to seven servers in Taiwan, with footprints back to the Chinese mainland. 
 After that, the trail disappeared into a cloud of angry Chinese government denials, and then an ugly exchange of accusations between Washington and Beijing. That continued Monday, with Chinese assertions that critics were trying to ''denigrate China'' and that the United States was pursuing ''hegemonic domination'' in cyberspace. 
 These recent events demonstrate how quickly the nation's escalating cyberbattles have outpaced the rush to find a deterrent, something equivalent to the cold-war-era strategy of threatening nuclear retaliation. 
 So far, despite millions of dollars spent on studies, that quest has failed. Last week, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton made the most comprehensive effort yet to warn potential adversaries that cyberattacks would not be ignored, drawing on the language of nuclear deterrence.
 ''States, terrorists and those who would act as their proxies must know that the United States will protect our networks,'' she declared in a speech on Thursday that drew an angry response from Beijing. ''Those who disrupt the free flow of information in our society or any other pose a threat to our economy, our government and our civil society.'' 
 But Mrs. Clinton did not say how the United States would respond, beyond suggesting that countries that knowingly permit cyberattacks to be launched from their territories would suffer damage to their reputations, and could be frozen out of the global economy.
 There is, in fact, an intense debate inside and outside the government about what the United States can credibly threaten. One alternative could be a diplomatic demarche, or formal protest, like the one the State Department said was forthcoming, but was still not delivered, in the Google case. Economic retaliation and criminal prosecution are also possibilities.
 Inside the National Security Agency, which secretly scours overseas computer networks, officials have debated whether evidence of an imminent cyberattack on the United States would justify a pre-emptive American cyberattack -- something the president would have to authorize. In an extreme case, like evidence that an adversary was about to launch an attack intended to shut down power stations across America, some officials argue that the right response might be a military strike. 
 ''We are now in the phase that we found ourselves in during the early 1950s, after the Soviets got the bomb,'' said Joseph Nye, a professor at the Kennedy School at Harvard. ''It won't have the same shape as nuclear deterrence, but what you heard Secretary Clinton doing was beginning to explain that we can create some high costs for attackers.''
 Fighting Shadows
 When the Pentagon summoned its top regional commanders from around the globe for meetings and a dinner with President Obama on Jan. 11, the war game prepared for them had nothing to do with Afghanistan, Iraq or Yemen. Instead, it was the simulated cyberattack -- a battle unlike any they had engaged in.
 Participants in the war game emerged with a worrisome realization. Because the Internet has blurred the line between military and civilian targets, an adversary can cripple a country -- say, freeze its credit markets -- without ever taking aim at a government installation or a military network, meaning that the Defense Department's advanced capabilities may not be brought to bear short of a presidential order.
 ''The fact of the matter,'' said one senior intelligence official, ''is that unless Google had told us about the attack on it and other companies, we probably never would have seen it. When you think about that, it's really scary.''
 William J. Lynn III, the deputy defense secretary, who oversaw the simulation, said in an interview after the exercise that America's concepts for protecting computer networks reminded him of one of defensive warfare's great failures, the Maginot Line of pre-World War II France. 
 Mr. Lynn, one of the Pentagon's top strategists for computer network operations, argues that the billions spent on defensive shields surrounding America's banks, businesses and military installations provide a similarly illusory sense of security. 
 ''A fortress mentality will not work in cyber,'' he said. ''We cannot retreat behind a Maginot Line of firewalls. We must also keep maneuvering. If we stand still for a minute, our adversaries will overtake us.''
 The Pentagon simulation and the nearly simultaneous real-world attacks on Google and more than 30 other companies show that those firewalls are falling fast. But if it is obvious that the government cannot afford to do nothing about such breaches, it is also clear that the old principles of retaliation -- you bomb Los Angeles, we'll destroy Moscow -- just do not translate. 
 ''We are looking beyond just the pure military might as the solution to every deterrence problem,'' said Gen. Kevin P. Chilton, in charge of the military's Strategic Command, which defends military computer networks. ''There are other elements of national power that can be brought to bear. You could deter a country with some economic moves, for example.''
 But first you would have to figure out who was behind the attack.
 Even Google's engineers could not track, with absolute certainty, the attackers who appeared to be trying to steal their source code and, perhaps, insert a ''Trojan horse'' -- a backdoor entryway to attack -- in Google's search engines. Chinese officials have denied their government was involved, and said nothing about American demands that it investigate. China's denials, American officials say, are one reason that President Obama has said nothing in public about the attacks -- a notable silence, given that he has made cybersecurity a central part of national security strategy. 
 ''You have to be quite careful about attributions and accusations,'' said a senior administration official deeply involved in dealing with the Chinese incident with Google. The official was authorized by the Obama administration to talk about its strategy, with the condition that he would not be named.
 ''It's the nature of these attacks thatthe forensics are difficult,'' the official added. ''The perpetrator can mask their involvement, or disguise it as another country's.'' Those are known as ''false flag'' attacks, and American officials worry about being fooled by a dissident group, or a criminal gang, into retaliating against the wrong country. 
 Nonetheless, the White House said in a statement that ''deterrence has been a fundamental part of the administration's cybersecurity efforts from the start,'' citing work in the past year to protect networks and ''international engagement to influence the behavior of potential adversaries.'' 
 Left unsaid is whether the Obama administration has decided whether it would ever threaten retaliatory cyberattacks or military attacks after a major cyberattack on American targets. The senior administration official provided by the White House, asked about Mr. Obama's thinking on the issue, said: ''Like most operational things like this, the less said, the better.'' But he added, ''there are authorities to deal with these attacks residing in many places, and ultimately, of course, with the president.''
 Others are less convinced. ''The U.S. is widely recognized to have pre-eminent offensive cybercapabilities, but it obtains little or no deterrent effect from this,'' said James A. Lewis, director of the Center for Strategic and International Studies program on technology and public policy.
 In its final years, the Bush administration started a highly classified effort, led by Melissa Hathaway, to build the foundations of a national cyberdeterrence strategy. ''We didn't even come close,'' she said in a recent interview. Her hope had been to recreate Project Solarium, which President Dwight D. Eisenhower began in the sunroom of the White House in 1953, to come up with new ways of thinking about the nuclear threats then facing the country. ''There was a lot of good work done, but it lacked the rigor of the original Solarium Project. They didn't produce what you need to do decision making.''
 Ms. Hathaway was asked to stay on to run Mr. Obama's early review. Yet when the unclassified version of its report was published in the spring, there was little mention of deterrence. She left the administration when she was not chosen as the White House cybersecurity coordinator. After a delay of seven months, that post is now filled: Howard A. Schmidt, a veteran computer specialist, reported for work last week, just as the government was sorting through the lessons of the Google attack and calculating its chances of halting a more serious one in the future.
 Government-Corporate Divide
 In nuclear deterrence, both the Americans and the Soviets knew it was all or nothing: the Cuban missile crisis was resolved out of fear of catastrophic escalation. But in cyberattacks, the damage can range from the minor to the catastrophic, from slowing computer searches to bringing down a country's cellphone networks, neutralizing its spy satellites, or crashing its electrical grid or its air traffic control systems. It is difficult to know if small attacks could escalate into bigger ones.
 So part of the problem is to calibrate a response to the severity of the attack. 
 The government has responded to the escalating cyberattacks by ordering up new strategies and a new United States Cyber Command. The office of Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates -- whose unclassified e-mail system was hacked in 2007 -- is developing a ''framework document'' that would describe the threat and potential responses, and perhaps the beginnings of a deterrence strategy to parallel the one used in the nuclear world.
 The new Cyber Command, if approved by Congress, would be run by Lt. Gen. Keith B. Alexander, head of the National Security Agency. Since the agency spies on the computer systems of foreign governments and terrorist groups, General Alexander would, in effect, be in charge of both finding and, if so ordered, neutralizing cyberattacks in the making.
 But many in the military, led by General Chilton of the Strategic Command and Gen. James E. Cartwright, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have been urging the United States to think more broadly about ways to deter attacks by threatening a country's economic well-being or its reputation. 
 Mrs. Clinton went down that road in her speech on Thursday, describing how a country that cracked down on Internet freedom or harbored groups that conduct cyberattacks could be ostracized. But though sanctions might work against a small country, few companies are likely to shun a market the size of China, or Russia, because they disapprove of how those governments control cyberspace or use cyberweapons. 
 That is what makes the Google-China standoff so fascinating. Google broke the silence that usually surrounds cyberattacks; most American banks or companies do not want to admit their computer systems were pierced. Google has said it will stop censoring searches conducted by Chinese, even if that means being thrown out of China. The threat alone is an attempt at deterrence: Google's executives are essentially betting that Beijing will back down, lift censorship of searches and crack down on the torrent of cyberattacks that pour out of China every day. If not, millions of young Chinese will be deprived of the Google search engine, and be left to the ones controlled by the Chinese government. 
 An Obama administration official who has been dealing with the Chinese mused recently, ''You could argue that Google came up with a potential deterrent for the Chinese before we did.''

HEADLINE: Mixed Martial Arts

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 In ''A Leaner Budget for Lean Times'' (editorial, Jan. 20), you call mixed martial arts, which Gov. David A. Paterson is proposing to legalize, ''controversial.'' In fact, the sport is not only legal in all but eight states, but if it should come to New York, our State Athletic Commission already has the mechanisms in place to ensure that such competitions follow the highest guidelines of health and safety. 
 Across the country, mixed martial arts matches do not represent something out of ''Fight Club''; rather, they are akin to boxing in how closely they are watched by highly trained medical staff and referees. Just like boxers, mixed martial arts competitors receive comprehensive neurological and physical examinations before fighting. They are drug-tested and are placed in strict weight classes, and all matches must be approved by a regulating body to reduce the likelihood of a mismatch resulting in serious injury.
 In New York, a medical advisory board would be established and charged with developing educational programs for medical staff and officials, so that health risks may be readily identified, minimized and prevented.
 In terms of revenue for the state, a recent study found that one event in the New York City area, for example, would generate $5.3 million in event spending and a total of $11.3 million in total economic activity for the local economy. 
 Governor Paterson understands that this is a sport that when properly regulated will provide the citizens of New York with both financial and entertainment value while maintaining high standards regarding the safety and health of participants.

HEADLINE: Families Struggle to Afford Food, Survey Finds

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Nearly one in five Americans said they lacked the money to buy the food they needed at some point in the last year, according to a survey co-sponsored by the Gallup organization and released Tuesday by an anti-hunger group.
 The numbers soared at the start of the recession, but dipped in 2009 despite the continuing rise in unemployment. The anti-hunger group, the Food Research and Action Center, attributed that trend to falling food prices, an increasing use of food stamps and a rise in the amount of the food stamps benefit. 
 More than 38 million Americans -- one in eight -- now receive food stamps, a record high. 
 The unusually large survey, which covered more than a half-million people, offers the most recent snapshot of hunger-related problems. And it is the first survey big enough to provide data on each of the nation's 435 Congressional districts and Washington, D.C. 
 Indeed, its most interesting finding may be just how broad a problem food affordability has become. In 45 states and 311 Congressional districts, 15 percent or more of those surveyed said they had recently lacked money to buy enough food.
 ''While there is certainly more hardship in some areas than in others, the data also show that this is a nearly universal problem,'' said James D. Weill, the hunger group's president.
 Efforts to measure hunger-related problems often spawn political disputes, and this one may do so as well. Some conservative critics have accused liberals of exaggerating the problems to justify increased government spending. Others have accused the conservative critics of ignoring the problem's depth.
 Avoiding the word ''hunger,'' the Agriculture Department releases an annual survey of what it now calls ''food insecurity.'' Its interviewers ask up to 18 nuanced questions about how often people skipped meals, cut portions or worried about running out of food. 
 Its most recent data, for 2008, found that 14.6 percent of Americans lacked consistent access to sufficient food, the highest in the survey's 14-year history.
 The Gallup survey asked just one question: ''Have there been times in the last month when you did not have enough money to buy food that you or your family needed?'' But it has been asking 1,000 people nearly every day for the past two years, producing a sample size much larger than the government's and one that can track monthly trends.
 In the fourth quarter of 2009, 18.5 percent of Americans said they had experienced problems in being able to afford food, down from 19.5 percent at the end of 2008. Among families with children, the rates were significantly higher, at 24.1 percent nationally in the most recent quarter.
 Mississippi had the largest number of people with what the report called ''food hardship'' (26.2 percent), while North Dakota had the lowest (10.6 percent).
 Despite the variation, the data suggests a problem that few areas of the country escape. Of the 100 largest metropolitan areas, 82 had food hardship rates of 15 percent or more. Likewise, only 23 Congressional districts had a food hardship rate of less than 10 percent, and 139 had rates of more than 20 percent. 
 The survey found the biggest problems in the South Bronx. In New York's 16th District, nearly 37 percent of the residents answered yes when asked if they had lacked the money to buy needed food.
 Last year's federal stimulus package, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, temporarily increased the average food stamps benefit by 18 percent, to about $130 a month for each member of a household.
 The hardship data is part of the Gallup Healthways Well-Being Index, which poses many questions about physical and mental health. (Gallup's partner in the project, Healthways, is a disease management company.) 
 The food research group bought the data when it learned that the survey included a question about food-related hardships.

HEADLINE: Still Needed: A Sheriff Of Finance

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
''We need a global sheriff.''
 Those were the words of George Soros, the investor and philanthropist, ahead of the World Economic Forum's annual meeting -- not this year, or last year, but in 2008, a little more than a month before Bear Stearns neared collapse. 
 Two years on, a day before the world's top regulators and bankers converge on the snowy alps of Davos, Switzerland, to discuss the state of the world economy, we are no closer to any sort of global financial regulator, let alone serious cooperation among countries about reform. 
 With the Obama administration now focused on Wall Street and hatching new measures almost by the week -- like the ''Volcker Rule'' last week, which would prevent commercial banks from trading on their own accounts, or the bailout tax the week before -- the United States' efforts are colliding with reforms in other parts of the world.
 Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain, for example, dismissed the Volcker idea on Monday. ''In the American circumstances, it may be necessary for the private equity and hedge fund work to be separated,'' he told reporters in London. ''We don't have that issue here.'' (Why he believes his country doesn't have ''that issue'' is unclear; firms like Barclays, for instance, face the same risks as their American counterparts.)
 Britain's chancellor, Alistair Darling, argued for a more coordinated approach: ''If everyone does their own thing it will achieve absolutely nothing,'' he told The Sunday Times. ''The banks are global -- they are quite capable of organizing themselves in such a way that if the regime is difficult in one country, they will go to another one, and that doesn't do anyone any good.''
 Mr. Darling's point is perhaps the most significant, because it goes directly to this notion of money moving around the world to chase returns. So banks in the United States may shrink because of the new rules, but will it matter if banks in China, so closely connected with ours, end up being twice the size? 
 After all, in an age of global banking, being too big to fail is not a national problem. Remember Iceland?
 Indeed, within hours of Mr. Obama's announcement of the Volcker Rule last week, Wall Street banks were looking for ways to skirt it and figure out which of their international rivals would fall under it. 
 For example, Deutsche Bank, an increasingly powerful presence in the United States, has a private equity arm called RREEF. Would Deutsche need to divest it? 
 At Goldman Sachs, there are questions about whether it can shed its bank holding company status so it can continue to pursue proprietary trading, or whether it would still be allowed to do that abroad through a subsidiary. 
 ''We now see single-country solutions being developed,'' said Howard J. Davies, the former chairman of the Financial Services Authority who is now director of the London School of Economics and Political Science and a board member of Morgan Stanley. ''They all have respectable rationales behind them, but are uncoordinated and bring risks of regulatory arbitrage.'' 
 Mr. Davies, who plans to be in Davos, may present a plan for a global regulator with real power -- ''A kind of financial W.T.O., if you like,'' as he describes it. 
 He said he is particularly concerned that a patchwork of uncoordinated reforms could lead to overregulation. 
 ''If we add all the new proposals together -- levies, Basel 3, leverage ratios, macroprudential capital requirements, Volcker rules, transaction taxes, systemic risk charges, etc., etc., we could move into an environment of reckless prudence,'' he added.
 Barney Frank, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, who is also planning to travel to Davos (thereby providing cover to all the Wall Street chiefs who might otherwise be derided for flying to Switzerland for a slope-side boondoggle), is worried that arguments like Mr. Davies' -- taken to the extreme -- will be used to stifle reform. 
 ''The objections to tough restrictions in the United States are that it will put American businesses in a disadvantaged position and financial companies will take their operations to friendlier shores,'' he said in a statement. ''I believe this is wrong, and, in fact, since becoming chairman of the Financial Services Committee, I and other American officials have been working with others to prevent this situation from arising.'' He added, ''My major goal this week is to further our efforts at cooperation and work to prevent any national regulatory approaches that allow companies to dodge the kind of accountability and responsibility that is needed.'' 
 There is one thing, though, that everyone in Davos can agree on: the public outrage around the world is still palpable.
 That may give the regulators an important stick to push through reforms -- even if they are temporary taxes on banks that are unlikely to lead to substantive changes. 
 ''As a result of the advancement by U.S. President Obama and the financial secretary Tim Geithner about their levy on wholesale lending, I think the proposals that I made at St. Andrews for an international levy,'' Mr. Brown said, ''are now gaining currency around the world.''
 But getting at real reform that will reshape the underwriting of the global financial system will take more than chest-thumps and one-upmanship among heads of states. We may still need a global sheriff.

HEADLINE: Obama's Measures for Middle Class

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG and PETER BAKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama vowed on Monday to ''reverse the overall erosion in middle class security'' as he stepped up his efforts to reconnect with Americans suffering from a weak economy and high unemployment.
 Previewing a theme that is sure to dominate his State of the Union address this week, Mr. Obama unveiled a package of modest initiatives intended to help families pay for child care, save for retirement, pay off student loans and care for elderly parents.
 ''None of these steps alone will solve all of the problems facing the middle class,'' Mr. Obama said, appearing alongside Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who leads the task force that produced the proposals. ''But hopefully some of these steps will re-establish some of the security that has slipped away in recent years. Because in the end, that's how Joe and I measure progress -- not how the markets are doing, but how the American people are doing.'' 
 Addressing advisers who developed the plans, Mr. Obama tried to frame them as part of his efforts to build what he calls ''a new foundation'' for the American economy and took credit for creating or saving two million jobs since taking office through his stimulus spending and tax cut program. But he acknowledged that seven million jobs had been lost, which he called ''an epidemic that demands our relentless and sustained response.''
 He noted that the House had passed a $154 billion jobs bill and that the Senate was working on one, but he did not tip his hand on how much additional spending he would support to increase job creation efforts. Aides over the weekend would not say whether he would be more explicit in the State of the Union address to the nation on Wednesday night.
 By focusing on what Mr. Biden called ''the sandwich generation'' -- struggling families squeezed between sending their children to college and caring for elderly parents -- Mr. Obama hopes to use his speech to demonstrate that he understands the economic pain of ordinary Americans. He noted Monday that the middle class was struggling even before the latest recession.
 ''Unfortunately, the middle class has been under assault for a long time,'' the president said. ''Too many Americans have known their own painful recessions long before any economist declared a recession.'' 
 Mr. Biden rejected criticism that the proposals Mr. Obama was unveiling were relatively small-bore compared with the vast and sweeping measures he pushed during his first year in office. ''They're big-deal things if you're just able to give some respite for a husband and wife, both working, to give a little bit of help,'' Mr. Biden said.
 The State of the Union address is still being written, but one senior official, describing it on the condition of anonymity, said its main themes would include ''creating good jobs, addressing the deficit, helping the middle class and changing Washington.''
 With his poll numbers down and Democrats fearing disaster in this year's midterm elections, Mr. Obama is at a particularly rocky point in his presidency and has been shifting his rhetoric lately to adopt a more populist tone. He heads into his first formal State of the Union speech in a radically reshaped political climate from even one week ago.
 His top domestic priority, a health care overhaul, is in jeopardy after the Republican victory in last week's Massachusetts Senate race -- a setback that White House advisers interpret as a reflection of Americans' deep anger and frustration over high unemployment and Wall Street bailouts.
 One advantage of the president's proposals is that they might appeal to people who are struggling financially without looking like the kind of broad expansion of the federal government that is making many Americans uneasy. They also would add little to the federal deficit at a time when Mr. Obama is pledging to reduce it. 
 For example, the president is calling on Congress to nearly double the child care tax credit for families earning less than $85,000 -- a proposal that, if adopted, would lower by $900 the taxes such families owe to the government. But the credit would not be refundable, meaning that families would not get cash payments if they owe no income taxes.
 Another of the president's proposals, a cap on federal loan payments for recent college graduates at 10 percent of income above a basic living allowance, would cost taxpayers roughly $1 billion. The expanded financing to help families care for elderly relatives would cost $102.5 million -- a pittance in a federal budget in which programs are often measured in tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars. And the automatic paycheck deduction program would simply be a way to encourage workers to save and would include tax credits to help companies with administrative costs.
 Such programs are, notably, much less far-reaching than Mr. Obama's expansive first-year agenda of passing an economic recovery package, bailing out the auto industry, overhauling the health care system, passing energy legislation and imposing tough restrictions on banks. That agenda has left him vulnerable to criticism that he is using the government to remake every aspect of American society.
 Instead, the White House wants to use Wednesday's address to explain how initiatives like the health care overhaul fit into his broader plan for job creation and the economy. On Sunday, as senior administration officials fanned out on the television talk shows, David Axelrod, Mr. Obama's senior adviser, insisted that the health care bill was not dead. But he did suggest that the administration was now more focused on changing insurance practices than on a broad expansion of coverage to the uninsured.
 ''There are so many elements of this -- tax breaks for small business, extending the life of Medicare, more assistance for seniors with their prescription drugs, a cap on out-of-pocket expenses, help for people with pre-existing conditions -- that are too important to walk away from,'' Mr. Axelrod said on the ABC program ''This Week.''
 With House and Senate leaders trying to figure out how to proceed legislatively, Mr. Axelrod also issued a warning to Democrats who were reconsidering their support for the health care measure. 
 ''As a political matter, the foolish thing to do would be for anybody else who supported this to walk away from it,'' he said. ''The underlying elements of it are popular and important, and people will never know what's in that bill until we pass it, the president signs it and they have a whole new range of protections they never had before.''
 How Mr. Obama will address health care in the State of the Union speech, though, remains an open question. Officials on Capitol Hill and at the White House said their talks on how to proceed with the legislation might not be resolved by Wednesday. This could put Mr. Obama in the awkward position of talking about a measure that is on shaky ground.

HEADLINE: Bernanke Is Gaining Supporters

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve committee that sets the nation's monetary policy will begin its first meeting of 2010 on Tuesday with a critical question hanging in the air: how the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, will emerge from the bruising fight over his nomination to a second four-year term.
 Senate Democratic leaders indicated Monday that they would try to move toward a vote on the nomination this week. Over the weekend, the White House tried to tamp down concerns over a sudden surge of opposition to Mr. Bernanke, whose term as chairman expires on Sunday. 
 In an interview Monday with ABC News, President Obama made clear that he stands behind Mr. Bernanke. ''He has my strongest support,'' Mr. Obama said. 
 ''What we need is somebody at the Federal Reserve who can make sure that the progress that we've made in stabilizing the economy continues,'' Mr. Obama added. ''I think Bernanke is the best person for that job.''
 Several senators announced on Monday that they would support Mr. Bernanke, including Dianne Feinstein of California and Max Baucus of Montana, both Democrats; and Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats. Senator John McCain of Arizona, the Republican presidential candidate in 2008, who had said he was leaning against Mr. Bernanke, announced that he would vote against him. 
 Mr. Bernanke made an unusual appearance on Capitol Hill on Monday, to meet with Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, who supports a second term. 
 Over all, the statements of support appeared to have turned the tide in Mr. Bernanke's favor. ''They're trying to change the momentum, and they may well have done that,'' said Senator David Vitter, a Louisiana Republican who voted against Mr. Bernanke when the Banking Committee took up the nomination last month. ''Supporters of his, with this new offensive, are trying to change the dynamic and create an impression of inevitability.''
 Even if Mr. Obama and the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, get the 60 votes necessary to surmount a threatened filibuster against Mr. Bernanke, the Fed appears to have taken a hit to its reputation. 
 ''The public's confidence in the Fed has been dramatically eroded, and that's not good,'' said Laurence H. Meyer, a former member of the Fed's board of governors who runs a consulting firm, Macroeconomic Advisers. ''The vulnerability of the Fed to a loss of independence is higher than it's ever been. And the chairman's credibility with Congress is very low, and that's not good for the institution.'' 
 Mr. Meyer said the Fed had ''done an abysmal job'' at regulating banks in the years preceding the financial crisis, but he said its extraordinary interventions in the market in 2008, under Mr. Bernanke, helped save the economy from even greater harm. ''Congress would have wanted his head even more than they do today if he hadn't intervened and there had been a catastrophe,'' Mr. Meyer said.
 Allan H. Meltzer, a professor of political economy at Carnegie Mellon University and an authority on the Fed's history, said the Senate had never rejected a president's nominee for chairman since the central bank was created in 1913.
 The last time a chairman faced so much opposition, Professor Meltzer said, was in 1983, when the Senate confirmed Paul A. Volcker to a second term by a vote of 84 to 16. (Mr. Volcker is now an important outside economic adviser to Mr. Obama.) 
 ''Bernanke hasn't been as politically adept as Volcker was,'' Professor Meltzer said, adding that the Fed had not done enough to push banks to expand lending and lift the economy -- a major concern cited on Friday by Mr. Reid when he offered a tepid endorsement of Mr. Bernanke. 
 The White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, acknowledged on Monday that the anger at Mr. Bernanke reflected populist resentment over the huge bailouts of financial institutions by the Fed and the Treasury in 2008. 
 ''There's still a great amount of anxiety in our economy, but Chairman Bernanke helped the president and the economic team steer through some very turbulent times and rough waters,'' Mr. Gibbs said. He said the Senate should send a signal to the markets by approving the nomination ''without political games.'' 
 Opponents of Mr. Bernanke said the public's outrage at the Fed was real. 
 ''I did a seven-county tour when I was back in Oregon two weeks ago, and when I noted that I had become the only Democrat to vote against Bernanke, it elicited cheers -- on the liberal side and on the conservative side,'' said Senator Jeff Merkley, a member of the Banking Committee, which approved Mr. Bernanke by a vote of 16 to 7.

HEADLINE: With Apple Tablet, Print Media Hope for a Payday

BYLINE: By BRAD STONE and STEPHANIE CLIFFORD; Brad Stone reported from San Francisco and Stephanie Clifford from New York. Richard Perez-Pena contributed reporting from New York and Brian Stelter from Las Vegas.

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
With the widely anticipated introduction of a tablet computer at an event here on Wednesday morning, Apple may be giving the media industry a kind of time machine -- a chance to undo mistakes of the past.
 Almost all media companies have run aground in the Internet Age as they gave away their print and video content on the Web and watched paying customers drift away as a result.
 People who have seen the tablet say Apple will market it not just as a way to read news, books and other material, but also a way for companies to charge for all that content. By marrying its famously slick software and slender designs with the iTunes payment system, Apple could help create a way for media companies to alter the economics and consumer attitudes of the digital era.
 This opportunity, however, comes with a sizable catch: Steven P. Jobs. 
 Mr. Jobs, the chief executive, made Apple the most important distributor of music by imposing its own will on the music labels, bullying them into accepting Apple's pricing and other terms. Apple sold lots of music, but the music labels claimed that iTunes had destroyed the concept of the album and damaged their already deteriorating bottom lines.
 With the new tablet, media companies could be submitting themselves to similar pricing restrictions and sacrificing their direct relationship with customers to Apple.
 For now, at least, the technology and media industries are looking at the brighter side. ''Steve believes in old media companies and wants them to do well,'' said a person who has seen the device and is familiar with Apple's marketing plan for it, but who did not want to be named because talking about it might alienate him from the company. ''He believes democracy is hinged on a free press and that depends on there being a professional press.''
 Part of the media industry's high hope for the tablet comes from descriptions of the device from analysts and others who have been briefed on it.
 It will run all the applications of the iPhone and iPod Touch, have a persistent wireless connection over 3G cellphone networks and Wi-Fi, and will be built with a 10-inch color display, allowing newspapers, magazines and book publishers to deliver their products with an eye to the design that had grabbed readers in print. 
 Their optimism for the tablet also stems from consumers' willingness to spend money using mobile devices. In the last decade, while people downloaded music illegally to their desktop computers, they happily paid small amounts of money on their cellphones to download ring tones and send text messages. 
 The iPhone has provided further proof that the economics of mobile devices are unique: the Apple App Store is expected to generate an estimated $1.4 billion this year, according to an analysis by Piper Jaffray.
 ''The iPhone was a harbinger,'' said Trip Hawkins, a founder of Electronic Arts and now chief executive of Digital Chocolate, which makes games for cellphones. ''When you have a device that is this convenient and fun for consumers to use, you can get a lot more people interested in paying for and engaging with the content. Big media companies should be all over this like a cheap suit.''
 Indeed, they already are. The New York Times Company, for example, is developing a version of its newspaper for the tablet, according to a person briefed on the effort, although executives declined to say what sort of deal had been struck.
 On Monday, The Times also announced that its media group division had created a new segment for ''reader applications,'' and named Yasmin Namini, the senior vice president for marketing and circulation, to head it. Executives said the timing was coincidental, prompted not by the Apple device specifically, but by the growing importance to The Times of electronic reading devices in general.
 Two magazine publishers, Conde Nast and Time Inc., have also created mockups of their magazines for tablets, even before such devices have hit the market. ''Apple upended the smartphone market with the introduction of the iPhone, and it's likely that they will, if they enter the tablet market, lead the pace there,'' said Thomas J. Wallace, editorial director of Conde Nast. He said that ''2010 is going to be the year of the tablet, and we feel we are in a very good position for it.''
 To successfully sell their material on the coming wave of tablets from Apple and other hardware makers like Hewlett-Packard, media companies may first have to adjust other parts of their digital strategies -- so consumers don't simply use the tablet's browser to get the same content free on the Web.
 Such shifts are under way. 
 In October, The Wall Street Journal, which is owned by the News Corporation, began charging for access for certain elements of its iPhone application. Esquire and GQ have taken steps toward charging for digital content, offering iPhone versions of their magazines for $2.99 for each issue. 
 The December issue of GQ was downloaded from the app store almost 7,000 times, and twice as many times for its January issue. Last week, The New York Times announced plans to begin charging, by next year, frequent Web site visitors who are not also newspaper subscribers to read the online version.
 Media companies may have to swallow hard before tethering their futures to any high-tech company, let alone Apple. Many publishers believe their economic health depends on finding a direct line to their customers, and it is not clear whether Apple -- and other aggregators of Internet content -- will allow that. 
 Magazine publishers, for example, maintain sophisticated databases about their customers, which lets them cross-sell products, renew subscriptions and entice advertisers with statistics about their wealthy readers. A big part of the business is automatic renewals charged to credit cards.
 But when magazine publishers sell applications through the iTunes store, they do not get credit card information or even the name of the buyer. 
 However, Apple, which makes most of its money selling devices, not content, has shown itself in some cases to be a more benevolent warden of online content, than, say, Amazon.com. Unlike Amazon with the Kindle, Apple allows application makers to set their own prices; some, like The Financial Times, give away applications for the iPhone, but then bill customers directly for repeat use.
 Nevertheless, concern over preserving the customer relationship is one reason, late last year, that major publishers including Time, Conde Nast, Meredith, the News Corporation and Hearst announced they had formed a consortium, called Next Issue Media, that plans to run its own online store selling digital issues and collecting consumer information. 
 ''It's fundamental to the business model of publishers,'' John Squires, the interim managing director of the consortium, said last month. ''We've always enjoyed an opportunity to know exactly where our consumers are, and be able to market other products to them. It's a very key issue for the founding members of this business.''
 One branch of big media whose fortunes may not be lifted by an Apple tablet, at least initially, is the TV business. Apple has also talked to television networks about offering access, for a monthly fee, to a selection of their hit shows, bypassing traditional distributors.
 But perhaps smarting from their experiences with Apple, many of the old-line media companies -- NBC Universal, Viacom and Discovery among them -- shrugged at (or totally dismissed) Apple's plans for a TV subscription package, according to executives briefed on the talks. A person briefed on Apple's plans confirmed that such a subscription video option was not part of any immediate offering.

HEADLINE: Don't Give Up Now

 BODY:
It would be a terrible mistake for Democrats to abandon comprehensive health care reform just because voters in the Massachusetts Senate race last week decided that they liked the Republican, Scott Brown, more than the Democrat, Martha Coakley.
 There is no question that without a filibuster-proof majority it will be a lot harder to pass a bill. But it should not be impossible if Congressional Democrats and the White House show courage and creativity. Health care reform is too important to throw away, and it is not too late to persuade voters that it is in their interest. 
 Congress is achingly close to passing legislation that would cover most uninsured Americans and provide much more security for all Americans -- guaranteeing that if they lose their jobs they will be able to buy affordable policies and can't be denied coverage because of pre-existing conditions. 
 If the Democrats quit now, so close to the goal line, the opportunity for large-scale reform could be lost for years. Meanwhile, the number of uninsured, currently more than 46 million, will keep going up and the cost of health care will continue to soar. 
 Many panicky Democrats see Mr. Brown's win as proof that angry voters will punish them in November if they press ahead with reform. We believe that is a misreading of what happened and what's possible. 
 Ms. Coakley ran an inept campaign. And the White House hasn't done enough to address voters' profound and legitimate fears about losing their jobs and their homes. But President Obama and Congressional Democrats have also clearly failed to explain why reform will make Americans' lives more secure -- not less. 
 What makes this all the more frustrating is that Massachusetts, which adopted its own very similar health care reform in 2006, is a compelling example of both the benefits and popularity of the effort. 
 A poll taken in Massachusetts after the election by The Washington Post, the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation and the Harvard School of Public Health found that a surprising 68 percent of those who had voted said that they supported their own state's plan, including slightly more than half of those who had voted for Mr. Brown. 
 Mr. Brown, who promised to block reform in Washington, voted for his state's program in 2006 and did not campaign against it this year. Instead, he argued that since Massachusetts' citizens already have coverage, why should they help pay to expand coverage elsewhere. 
 That cynical I've-got-mine argument doesn't make a lot of sense -- even in Massachusetts. The Senate bill would funnel additional money into the Massachusetts program and federal efforts to rein in costs should ultimately benefit all of the states. 
 Democrats should take another look at what really happened in Massachusetts and then summon the nerve to enact comprehensive reform. They must make clear to voters that they have little to fear. Even the mandate requiring everyone to buy insurance doesn't kick in until 2014. And they must make clear that reform offers immediate gains, especially for middle-class Americans. 
 Once the bill becomes law, many dependent children could remain on their parents' policies until age 26. Insurers would no longer be able to set lifetime caps on the amount they will pay for health care. Children could not be denied coverage because of pre-existing conditions. The gap in drug coverage for Medicare beneficiaries, known as the doughnut hole, would begin to close. And small businesses would immediately get tax credits to cover their employees. 
 Recent polls show that the public is divided, with more opposing the bills than favoring them. The negatives have been driven up by critics' distortions about a supposed government takeover of medicine and the tawdry deal-making necessary to win 60 votes to overcome a Republican filibuster in the Senate. 
 Still, a recent national poll by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation found that large shares of people became more supportive when told about such provisions as tax credits for small businesses that offer coverage, exchanges where people could choose among competing policies, and rules against denying coverage. 
 We are hearing a lot of talk in Washington, including from President Obama, about possibly paring down the current bills -- to cover many fewer of the uninsured and focus instead on reeling in the worst abuses of the insurance industry and reining in health care costs. That could be difficult technically; many of the parts are not easy to disentangle without undermining their effectiveness. And the politics on Capitol Hill -- where the Republicans are determined to oppose pretty much anything President Obama endorses -- are unlikely to get easier. 
 The most promising path forward would be for House Democrats to pass the Senate bill as is and send it to the president for his signature. That would allow the administration and Congress to pivot immediately to job creation and other economic issues. The Senate bill is not perfect, but it would expand coverage to 94 percent of all citizens and legal residents by 2019, reduce the deficit for decades to come, and create pilot programs to move the medical system toward better care at lower costs. 
 Rank-and-file House Democrats apparently won't accept the Senate bill without modification. So Congressional leaders are looking for ways to commit both the House and the Senate to changes -- such as better subsidies to make insurance more affordable -- that could be approved through parallel ''budget reconciliation'' legislation that could be approved by a simple majority in both the Senate and House. 
 This is a once-in-a-generation chance. President Obama must explain to the American people why reform is essential to their health and security and this nation's future. And he must insist that Congress finish the job.

HEADLINE: U.S. to Join Talks on Helping Yemen Gain Stability

BYLINE: By ROBERT F. WORTH

DATELINE: SANA, Yemen 

 BODY:
A month after the failed airplane bomb plot that put this country's problem with Al Qaeda in the international spotlight, the United States and 20 other countries are gathering for a conference on Wednesday in London to discuss ways to address Yemen's growing instability.
 But in their efforts to move beyond a narrowly military approach to fighting Al Qaeda here, the conference participants are likely to run up against a morass of social, political and logistical obstacles that have frustrated similar efforts in the past. And some diplomats and analysts say they fear that the sudden rush of aid and attention, if it is not handled properly, could reinforce patterns of patronage that have contributed indirectly to Yemen's culture of extremism. 
 Western donors have already begun increasing their aid commitments, and the London conference -- though not aimed at securing more money -- is focused on the need to address the many crises that help breed radicalism in Yemen. 
 The facts are appalling: half the population is living on less than $2 a day; the official rate of illiteracy is 45 percent; fewer than half of Yemenis from ages 15 to 24 are employed. Outside the major cities, access to public water supplies, electricity and health services is vanishingly rare.
 Those desperately poor hinterlands have become a haven for Qaeda militants, who have regrouped here in the past two years and claimed credit for training Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the Nigerian militant accused of trying to bomb a Detroit-bound jet on Dec. 25.
 Addressing Yemen's needs, though, is no simple matter. As in Afghanistan and Iraq in recent years, security concerns have put some of this country's poorest and most dangerous areas beyond the reach of development assistance. An intermittent war rages in the country's remote north, and a secessionist movement has grown worse in the south.
 A vast, corrupt and spectacularly inefficient government bureaucracy has been a stubborn obstacle to aid as well. For those reasons, only a tiny fraction of the $4.7 billion pledged to Yemen during a London donor conference in 2006 has been spent.
 More money, in other words, is not necessarily the answer. Yemen's main development agency, the Social Fund for Development, has $12 million in unspent aid money for Jawf Province, a huge, impoverished area where Qaeda militants have found refuge, said the agency's director, Abdulkarim Ismail al-Arhabi. The province is too dangerous, and there are no effective intermediaries who could help spend it, Mr. Arhabi said.
 Western donors say they understand the challenges and are calling for political and economic reform to pave the way for more effective aid. Fixing Yemen's system of diesel fuel subsidies -- which consume almost a third of the budget and are widely said to be an avenue for smuggling and kickbacks -- is an important priority, diplomats say.
 The conference will also seek a more unified international approach to Yemen, including support from its immediate neighbors. Pressing Persian Gulf countries to open their labor markets to Yemenis could provide tremendous relief for the ailing economy, Western and Yemeni officials say.
 Another focus will be Saudi Arabia, which gives far more to Yemen than any other country, though mostly through unofficial channels. Western diplomats say they hope to persuade Saudi Arabia to start making its support conditional on political and economic reforms in Yemen.
 But previous reform efforts have repeatedly stalled. And diplomats say that the publicity created by the Dec. 25 bombing attempt could generate more foreign military and development aid, which in turn could -- without the necessary reforms -- strengthen the patronage networks that have helped weaken Yemen's state institutions in the past.
 Part of the problem, critics say, is that Yemen's president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, has concentrated too much power in his own hands, skillfully balancing the country's various political and tribal groups over his 32 years in office, but failing to build a modern state.
 ''At the heart of the economic problem is corruption, and at the heart of the corruption problem is unchecked presidential power,'' said Abdel Ghani al-Iryani, a political consultant. Government officials counter that patronage is part of the price of stability in a country that is fragmented along lines of sect, tribe, region and social class. They say that corruption, though widespread, has been exaggerated, and that reforms are under way. Last year Mr. Saleh endorsed a 10-point plan that would bring new blood to the civil service and cut back on the government's use of diesel fuel.
 ''The corruption is a symptom of the lack of money, the lack of capacity for monitoring this kind of thing,'' said Jalal Yacoub, a deputy finance minister and one of the authors of the plan.
 The Yemeni state's administrative weakness, Mr. Yacoub added, derives in part from two major crises of recent years. North and South Yemen united in 1990, and the north had to absorb hundreds of thousands of public employees from the formerly socialist south. A year later, Saudi Arabia expelled a million Yemeni laborers, following Mr. Saleh's decision to side with Saddam Hussein in the first Persian Gulf war. Afterward, the Yemeni civil service became a social safety net, as Yemen struggled to find jobs for the returning workers.
 Mr. Yacoub and other Yemeni officials say they put their hopes in well-financed pilot projects that can quickly improve people's lives, especially in remote areas where distrust of the government is high. That is also the goal of the United States Agency for International Development, which channels its aid mostly through Yemeni nongovernmental groups. The agency signed a $121 million three-year development assistance program in September, a major increase.
 But that effort will be hampered by Washington's inability to send Americans to Yemen's most dangerous areas, which are also some of its poorest. And they are not the first efforts of their kind. Starting in 2003, a former United States envoy, Edmund J. Hull, traveled to Marib, Jawf, Shabwa and Abyan Provinces to foster aid projects, including the building of new hospitals. 
 ''The formula was 'no security without development, no development without security,' '' Mr. Hull recalled. ''I proposed a virtuous circle to replace the vicious circle.''
 Today, the provinces Mr. Hull focused on constitute the main havens of Al Qaeda in Yemen.

 CORRECTION:
An article on Wednesday about a new effort by the United States and other countries to help stabilize Yemen, which is threatened by poverty, insurgency and Al Qaeda militants, misstated the year that Edmund J. Hull, a former United States ambassador to Yemen, first traveled to that country's more dangerous areas in an earlier American effort to foster aid projects. It was 2002, not 2003.

HEADLINE: Restaurants Reboot at Reality-Show Speed

BYLINE: By MARK ROZZO

 BODY:
LAST Saturday afternoon at the Cooper Square Hotel on the Bowery, some 60 staffers sat down for a marathon tasting orchestrated by the chef Scott Conant, who will soon open a new restaurant called Faustina there. Amid the aroma of fresh paint, the whine of a circular saw, and the sight of artisans applying silver gilt to various surfaces, Faustina's waiters and dishwashers sampled olive-oil-poached sardines, veal porterhouse steaks and tajarin pasta with tomato and sea urchin (which Mr. Conant described as ''sex in a bowl'').
 Just days before the first try-out dinner for friends on Jan. 29, there was a pre-curtain crackle in the air. But unlike most restaurants, Faustina has not had the luxury -- or the patience-testing ordeal -- of a slow build played out across months of meticulous planning, financial consultations and menu tinkering. The previous tenant, Table 8, had evacuated less than three weeks earlier, on Jan. 4. 
 ''I feel like I'm a contestant on my own Food Network show,'' Mr. Conant said, referring to ''24 Hour Restaurant Battle,'' a new program he hosts that allots competitors precisely one day to whip up a new restaurant, from concept to menu to decor. 
 This is the era of high-velocity restaurant makeovers, where noteworthy establishments are born, or reborn, in the time it takes to make a batch of crostini. In September, Ed's Chowder House rose from the ashes of a steakhouse, Center Cut, which had closed less than a month earlier. In San Francisco, the Australian chef Luke Mangan's restaurant, South, closed shop on Dec. 19 and will reopen in February -- minus Mr. Mangan -- as Marlowe, a ''friendly neighborhood'' bistro. Meanwhile, a Guinness record nomination is in order for the Tasting Kitchen in Venice, Calif., which managed to open all of six days after taking over from the A. K. Restaurant Bar + Grill last summer.
 Many of these fast-track reboots are products of the economy. An empty space bleeds money, and no one wants that during a downturn. 
 At Faustina, the high-speed makeover feels more like an exorcism: Table 8 was dark and loud, and it came undone with Conan O'Brien-like swiftness, seven months after a high-profile opening. The new space -- even in its unfinished state -- is noticeably airier, with built-ins designed by Todd Capron and banquettes in gray Naugahyde. But Mr. Conant said he retained most of Table 8's employees, some of whom are Haitian. ''There was no way we were going to leave those people without jobs right now.''
 Across town at the former Craftsteak, which served its last Wagyu flatiron on New Year's Eve, Tom Colicchio has kept much intact amid a whirlwind transformation into Colicchio & Sons, which opened on Jan. 18. ''If you were a regular here, you'll notice the differences,'' Mr. Colicchio said. ''But if you were here once, you'll walk in and you won't even notice it's changed.''
 The 3,500-square-foot space has retained many of its signature elements, including the painter Stephen Hannock's mammoth canvas, ''Chelsea Winter with Elevated Park; New York High Line.'' The architecture firm Bentel & Bentel, which recently received an American Institute of Architects award for its Craftsteak design, was charged with gently tweaking it. After all, sticking with your team and not overdoing it (no burbling fountains) is the best way to get the job done in a hurry. For Faustina, Mr. Conant also relied upon designers he'd worked with before.
 The changes at Colicchio & Sons -- which Mr. Colicchio estimates cost about $400,000 -- are subtle, yet striking. What first greets your eye is an imposing steel shelf stuffed with firewood to help keep the enormous new Wood Stone oven -- where Mr. Colicchio says he will be found working most nights -- smoking at 650 degrees. ''The glow really warms the place up,'' he said. 
 The result is cozier than Craftsteak was; even the servers' ties are noticeably looser. Colicchio & Sons is a frank admission that the era of blockbuster corporate-card-fueled restaurants is over for now.
 That notion resonates with Robin Standefer, a founder of Roman and Williams, the firm responsible for the striking interiors of the Standard Grill and the Breslin. ''These days, the elite, fancy, glamorous restaurant is a hard concept to sustain,'' she said. When asked about the prospect of completing a makeover in three weeks, Ms. Standefer sounded game, but cautioned that ''a restaurant is about a whole collection of things -- food, spirit and, of course, atmosphere. It can be very hard to remake that really, really quick. You could have an identity crisis on your hands.'' 
 Mr. Colicchio shaved days off the process of assembling the new menu by dipping into the recipe bag. Dishes he honed in his pre-Craft days, such as sea urchin and crab fondue, make welcome, comforting returns.
 Like Colicchio & Sons, Faustina will strike a conspicuously informal tone when it opens on Feb. 5. The menu, Mr. Conant said, was worked up during late nights at his other restaurant, Scarpetta. And the Table 8 kitchen turned out to be an ideal found object: ''This is probably the best kitchen I've ever worked in.'' Still, how do you get it all done in three weeks?
 ''We did everything to make this happen,'' he said. ''We called in a few favors. But mainly, everyone here is going above and beyond, working longer hours, doing more for the dollars.'' Antonello Paganuzzi, Mr. Conant's director of operations, took a breather from running through the menu and chimed in with his own Vince Lombardi-esque take: ''No guts, no glory.''

HEADLINE: On New Environmental Scoreboard, U.S. and China Plummet While Iceland Leads

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
A new ranking of the world's nations by environmental performance puts some of the globe's largest economies far down the list, with the United States sinking to 61st and China to 121st. 
 In the previous version of the Environmental Performance Index, compiled every two years by Yale and Columbia University researchers, the United States ranked 39th, and China 105th. 
 The top performer this year is Iceland, which gets virtually all of its power from renewable sources -- hydropower and geothermal energy. It was joined in the top tier by a cluster of European countries known for their green efforts, including Switzerland, Sweden, Norway and Finland. 
 ''Countries that take seriously the environment as a policy challenge do improve, and those that don't deteriorate,'' said Daniel C. Esty, director of the Yale Center for Environmental Law and Policy, who oversees the index project. ''Both the U.S. and China are suffering because they're industrial and haven't been paying much attention to environmental policy.''
 The index, viewable online at epi.yale.edu, assigns each country a cumulative score based on its performance in areas that include environmental health, preservation of habitat and reductions in greenhouse gases, air pollution and waste.
 Costa Rica and Colombia remained in the top ranks. Costa Rica has made important efforts to conserve its rain forest, and Colombia has led the way in shifting to fuel-efficient mass transit. 
 Yet the new rankings, which are to be presented Thursday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, cannot be precisely compared with the 2008 index, researchers said. The scientists have shifted their methodology slightly as they seek to zero in on the fairest way to quantify the broad and nebulous area of environmental performance. 
 Because most of the data are from 2007 and 2008, the index does not fully reflect new efforts by the Obama administration or China's government to improve environmental performance. 
 It also does not fully capture the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in many countries resulting from the current recession. 
 One reason that Iceland scored so well, beyond its energy policies, may be its economic tailspin, one of Western Europe's worst, which began with a banking crisis in 2008, Mr. Esty said. 
 Another crucial caveat is that the researchers rely heavily on data that the countries themselves report to international groups like the United Nations and the World Bank. The researchers said that countries like Cuba, in ninth place, are thought to score artificially high because the data is either collected poorly or massaged to signal progress.
 The lack of reliable environmental data is a major challenge, the researchers said. ''There are so many countries that are not collecting even minimal data sets,'' said Christine Kim, a researcher at Yale who is program manager of the project. ''The state of the data hasn't gotten much better in the last 10 years. We have better data on baseball than we do on climate change.'' 
 Developing a system to quantify and track environmental performance would be essential to the success of any global climate treaty requiring industrialized countries to cut their emissions and emerging economies to reduce their emissions growth. Negotiators from around the globe failed to produce a binding agreement in Copenhagen last month, but plan to meet again in Mexico City in late November.
 Discord over how to measure, report and verify climate data was one factor that stymied progress in Copenhagen. The Chinese, for example, use their own scales to measure factors like air pollution, and it is hard to translate their readings into accepted Western scientific scales. 
 Because a country's final ranking is based on so many environmental factors, the devil is often in the details. 
 Extenuating circumstances may distort the data. 
 Countries like Slovakia, Serbia and Montenegro performed well in part because severe economic slumps in these places shut down polluting factories, Mr. Esty said. 
 Some countries that score extraordinarily well in one area may not perform well over all because of unusually lackluster performances in another. The United States scores well in forestry and the provision of safe drinking water, but its ranking is low because of poor scores in areas like heat-trapping emissions and urban air pollutants like sulfur dioxide. 
 Denmark, known as an environmental trailblazer, comes in at a surprising 32nd place. Although it has pioneered alternative energy sources like wind power, it still uses a fair amount of fossil fuel and has poor scores in protecting its fisheries. 
 ''This data requires people to dig in and see why they are where they are,'' Ms. Kim said. ''For every country there are strengths and weaknesses.''

HEADLINE: Housing Indexes for November Indicate a Pause, but Not a Plunge

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD

 BODY:
The recovery in the housing market is still alive, barely.
 Home prices managed a 0.2 percent seasonally adjusted gain in November from the previous month, according to the Standard & Poor's Case-Shiller Home Price Index.
 The data, released Tuesday, reflected frenzied activity in 20 major cities as people competed to buy houses to take advantage of a government tax credit. But all those sales did not produce much more than flat prices. 
 A second index released on Tuesday showed a healthier market. The Federal Housing Finance Agency said its price index, which uses data from mortgages that have been sold to or guaranteed by the government, rose 0.7 percent in November from the previous month. But the agency also revised its October figures downward. 
 To blur the picture even more, a third national housing price index was released last week. Issued by the data firm First American CoreLogic, it showed a decline of 0.2 percent in November.
 Put all these indexes together, and a portrait emerges of a market going nowhere.
 ''The winter pause that people thought was going to happen seems to be happening,'' said Maureen Maitland, vice president for index services at S.& P.
 A pause is certainly better than a plunge, which is what was happening during 2007 and 2008. But sales have slowed markedly since November. It is only a matter of time, the analysts say, before prices also undergo at least a slight dip.
 ''We expect home price deflation to resume in the December or January Case-Shiller indices and continue through 2010,'' Zelman & Associates wrote in a research note.
 The 20-city Case-Shiller composite price index is down 29.2 percent from its peak in the second quarter of 2006 and 5.3 percent over the last year. Average home prices are where they were in late 2003.
 Prices in five of the cities fell in November from the previous month, while 15 rose. Las Vegas managed to snap its long losing streak and eke out a 0.1 percent gain. The strongest cities were on the West Coast, including San Francisco, San Diego and Los Angeles. The five that fell included Chicago, Miami and New York.
 The West Coast Case-Shiller numbers were backed up by the Federal Housing Finance Agency data, which showed that the Pacific was the strongest of nine United States regions both for the month and the last year. 
 Nothing is simple about real estate these days, however. Jim Klinge, an agent in northern San Diego who keeps a close watch on sales trends, recently published on his blog comparative statistics for the first 15 days of January going back 12 years.
 There were 61 closed deals in the two weeks this year, which places 2010 roughly between the 1999 peak of 125 and the 2008 nadir of 36. But the price buyers are paying per square foot -- one of the most accurate measures of pricing trends -- is still falling. Last year it was $410 a foot; this year, it is $368.
 The local market ''is blazingly hot,'' Mr. Klinge said, but only for sellers who want to get rid of their place, quickly.
 ''These sellers feel like they're giving the house away, which is what buyers want,'' he said. ''If the sellers price the house too high, no one will even look at it.''
 The only sellers who can do this, of course, are ones willing and able to take a big loss. Mr. Klinge showed a house Tuesday that was for sale for $800,000. The owners had paid $975,000 a few years ago, so they will lose nearly all their down payment. ''It was a second home, and they just wanted to be rid of it,'' the agent said.
 Seasonal adjustments are affecting the numbers in San Diego and everywhere else. These have the effect of smoothing out swings in the raw numbers. On an unadjusted basis, the individual cities in the Case-Shiller index fared worse: 13 fell, while the composite price index dropped 0.2 percent.
 The Conference Board's monthly measure of consumer confidence, also released Tuesday, rose to 55.9 in January from a revised 53.6 in December. That was more of an improvement than analysts had expected but still low by historical standards.
 Dan Greenhaus, chief economic strategist with Miller Tabak, said that the long-term average was about 95, and that the high reading was 144 early in 2000. ''Clearly more work on the confidence front needs to be done,'' he said.

HEADLINE: As Revenue Climbs 10%, Verizon Posts a Loss Related to a Charge for Layoffs

BYLINE: By JENNA WORTHAM

 BODY:
Verizonreported a fourth-quarter loss of $653 million on Tuesday, mostly because of costs related to layoffs, despite a 10 percent increase in revenue. 
 The company also said it planned to cut an additional 13,000 jobs this year. 
 The company said it added 2.2 million wireless subscribers in the quarter, up substantially from the 1.2 million added a year earlier. 
 The quarterly loss came to 23 cents a share and contrasted with a profit of $1.24 billion, or 43 cents a share a year earlier. It took a charge of $3 billion, or 66 cents a share, related to severance expenses in the quarter. 
 Revenue rose to $27.1 billion, from $24.65 billion in the period a year earlier, much of it because of the acquisition of the Alltel Corporation. Still, the results fell short of Wall Street expectations. ''Like all U.S. carriers, Verizon has felt the impact of the macro environment in 2009,'' wrote Julien Blin, an independent analyst who keeps a keen eye on the wireless industry, in a note to clients Tuesday. ''However, we should start to see signs of recovery in 2010.''
 During a call to investors and analysts on Tuesday, Verizon's chief financial officer, John Killian, said the company would continue to trim costs to combat the deterioration of its residential wireline phone business and its corporate business that is still recovering from the recession. Over the last two years, the company eliminated 26,000 jobs in its wireline sector. Verizon employs about 223,000 people.
 ''Verizon is doing everything they can to cut costs and they're very capable operators, but the margins of this business keep getting worse,'' said Craig Moffett, a senior research analyst with Bernstein Research. ''It's a pattern we should probably get used to.''
 Revenue from Verizon's traditional wireline services dipped 3.9 percent to $11.5 billion, compared with the fourth quarter of 2008, as more customers shift to cellphones. 
 But the company also said data revenue, from services like text messaging or browsing the Web, was up 31 percent, to $16 billion, largely driven by increased use of services and data plans by cellphone customers. Additionally, wireless data revenue represented a larger share of all service revenue, 32 percent compared with 26.5 percent a year earlier. 
 Verizon Wireless has struggled to keep up with the momentum of the rival carrier, AT&T, which has been adding subscribers at a rapid clip, in large part because of the popularity of the iPhone, for which it is the sole carrier in the United States. 
 But Verizon recently began selling smartphones like the Motorola Droid, the HTC Droid Eris and BlackBerry Storm 2, which are proving popular, Ivan G. Seidenberg, chief executive of the company, said during a call to investors on Tuesday. The company did not disclose figures, but analysts estimate that the Droid could have sold as many as a million units since it first went on sale in November. On Monday, Applereported that it shipped nearly nine million iPhones during its most recent quarter.
 ''We have a strong and growing smartphone portfolio, '' Mr. Seidenberg said. ''We see plenty of opportunities for data growth, driven by new enhanced devices and innovative content. We're very well positioned in 2010.'' 
 He said Verizon had several new phones coming out, including two devices from Palm, the Pre Plus and the Pixi Plus. It is widely expected that Verizon will sell a version of the iPhone that would work on Verizon's enhanced network, but the company would not confirm that.
 Analysts were not impressed with the growth in wireless. 
 ''For all of the spectacular growth of wireless data, it's still no better than a break even offset for the declines in wireless voice,'' Mr. Moffett said. ''Revenue per customer isn't growing. So while the wireless business is doing really well, it's not the growth engine it used to be.'' For the year, Verizon's net income was $3.6 billion, down from $6.4 billion in the comparable period a year earlier, on revenue of $107.8 billion.
 Shares of Verizon fell 51 cents, to $30.17.

HEADLINE: I.R.S. Moves To Uncover Dubious Use Of Shelters

BYLINE: By LYNNLEY BROWNING

 BODY:
The Internal Revenue Service said on Tuesday that it would require large corporations to reveal basic information about their tax transactions, a surprise move intended to root out questionable or illegal tax shelters.
 Under the plan, companies with assets of at least $10 million that also file broader disclosures with the Securities and Exchange Commission would be required each year to provide the I.R.S. with information about tax transactions that might be challenged by the agency. 
 The I.R.S. rule piggybacks a Financial Accounting and Standards Board regulation known as Fin 48, which addresses ''accounting for uncertainty in income taxes,'' and will affect most companies. They will be required to disclose what their total tax bill might be if the I.R.S. were to challenge any of their transactions, and to provide short summaries of each one even if the transactions are not currently deemed illegal by the I.R.S. 
 Corporate tax lawyers and experts were stunned by the announcement.
 ''This is a massive, very important shift,'' said Robert Willens, an accounting and tax expert in New York. ''Corporations have treated audits as a game of 'come see what you can find, we're not going to volunteer stuff,' and now the balance of power will shift to the I.R.S.'' 
 The disclosure rule would not affect corporate filings until at least 2011, Douglas H. Shulman, the I.R.S. commissioner, said in an interview in New York at a meeting of the New York State Bar Association's tax section. 
 The I.R.S. spends a quarter of its time in routine corporate audits simply trying to ferret out issues, Mr. Shulman said. ''That is inefficient and a terrible waste of time,'' he said. ''The goal is simple: to cut down on the time it takes to find an issue and to complete an audit.''
 Mr. Shulman said that ''our job is going to be more analysis of data and less feet on the street,'' a reference to I.R.S. auditors combing through corporate books in search of violations. ''We're not necessarily going to do fewer audits in aggregate, but they're going to be smarter ones.''
 Corporations routinely use sophisticated tax transactions to lower their federal tax bills by billions of dollars. While the new rule will provide the I.R.S. a glimpse into aggressive shelters, it will also allow the agency to study whether companies are correctly computing tax benefits. 
 The rule covers transactions for which companies have not established tax reserves under Fin 48 rules because they think they would win any legal skirmishes with the I.R.S. in tax court. And it covers transactions that have not traditionally been the focus of I.R.S. legal actions. 
 I.R.S. officials said on Tuesday that the rule covered parent corporations and their subsidiaries and related entities, including those overseas, adding that it could be applied to partnerships and other similar entities as well. The agency plans to ask Congress to approve penalties and sanctions for companies that fail to make the annual disclosures.
 Mr. Shulman said the I.R.S. would exercise ''a policy of restraint'' when requesting internal tax papers used by corporations to outline and justify their tax positions. Corporations do not like to disclose the papers because they give the I.R.S. a roadmap to gray areas of the tax code.
 Mr. Shulman said that with the economy ailing, ''we're particularly interested in issues of losses.'' He also cited abuses of transfer pricing -- a technique multinational corporations employ to reduce taxes by keeping profits offshore in low-tax or no-tax havens -- and the use of sophisticated financial products, including derivatives.
 Under the rule, corporations would be required to state in a few sentences the nature of the tax transaction, and to disclose the maximum amount of tax exposure if it were to be ruled invalid by the I.R.S. 
 Corporations would not have to disclose the internal workings of transactions or the legal rationale for them. The rule also does not require corporations to disclose their ''risk assessment'' or the ''tax reserve amounts'' related to a transaction.

HEADLINE: The New Old Way To Tote Your Beer

BYLINE: By ROBERT SIMONSON

 BODY:
BY midafternoon on a recent Saturday, Bierkraft, the beer emporium and grocery on Fifth Avenue in Park Slope, Brooklyn, was half-filled with customers, many of them parents with babies or toddlers in tow. They were browsing the more than 1,000 varieties of bottled beer or surveying the listing of selections available on the 13 taps and 3 cask lines. Some carried a good-sized satchel. 
 Diaper bag? Gym clothes? 
 No. It was a tote for their growlers. 
 Growlers -- 64-ounce glass vessels that look like a moonshine jug -- have become the beer accessory of the moment. And the jugs, filled at taps in bars and stores, are not just the toys of the bearded, flannel-shirt, beer-geek set.
 ''In the beginning we tried to figure out, 'Who's going to be our market?' '' said Ben Granger, 32, an owner of Bierkraft, which began filling growlers in spring 2006. ''We thought, mullet-heads and beer-bellied dudes. But the first run was ladies with strollers. They will tell you they're buying them for their husbands. Three weeks later, they've got two. One's his and one's hers. The next one that caught me by surprise was dads coming in with their kids. Then there's the beer crowd who'll rush in to get on this or that before it's gone. There's no age limit.'' 
 Michael Endelman, a journalist at Rolling Stone, is one of those growler-loving fathers. ''I don't go to bars too much anymore,'' he said, gesturing to his baby daughter Mimi. ''It just seems like a great way to be a beer geek without going out.'' 
 Some customers appreciate growlers for reasons of economy (refills range from $8 to $20 or more) or ecology. And as more craft brewers choose not to bottle their products, many fans like the idea of getting fresh beer that until recently was sold only in specialized bars.
 Liz Thorpe, vice president of Murray's Cheese, said she had two to four growlers at home at any given time. ''Good beer makes everything more special,'' Ms. Thorpe said while stocking up for a recent National Football League playoff game. ''I like me some football, but I don't like me some Coors Light. So I'm ensuring I will be happy this afternoon.'' Barely a week has passed in recent months without some bar or beer store in New York City trumpeting the arrival of growlers, which are typically embossed with the name of their business. Even the Gristedes grocery chain has gotten in on the act; the University Place store in Manhattan began carrying them in November. 
 Offerings can change daily, even hourly.
 Some new growler users believe they're getting in on the latest thing, but beer lovers know better.
 ''Growlers have been around since Christ was a child,'' Mr. Granger said. ''We're not doing anything new.'' 
 In the late 19th century and the early 20th century, both The New York Times and The Brooklyn Eagle regularly published contentious stories about the containers, which then took the form of small galvanized pails. The articles cataloged the complaints of saloon keepers, who thought growlers cut into their profit, and those of temperance groups, who hoped to curb home drinking. 
 ''Rushing the growler,'' connoting children hustling pails of beer for adults from bar to table, was a common expression. The curious name is thought to be inspired by the rumbling noise escaping carbon dioxide made as the beer sloshed about in the pail. 
 In more modern times, growlers could be found at brew pubs like Heartland Brewery, which has served beer to go since opening in 1995. The jugs -- which, according to the New York State Liquor Authority, have always been legal at both retail outlets and bars -- have proliferated lately, said Heartland's founder, Jon Bloostein, because there are more interesting beers to go in them.
 ''People's palates have become more sophisticated,'' Mr. Bloostein said. ''Look at the number of beer bars in Manhattan, and especially Brooklyn. And the offerings at regular bars are leaning toward craft beers.''
 The Whole Foods beer store on Houston Street began its program in 2007. The chain's first to carry the vessels, it has done as much as any store to introduce New Yorkers to growler culture. The manager, Jeff Wallace, said he saw other reasons for the trend. 
 ''It's basically a really good way to promote recycling, because you bring back your jug,'' Mr. Wallace said. ''And it's a cheap and affordable way to get fresh draft beer.'' He said growlers made up half the beer store's business. Whole Foods stores in TriBeCa and on the Upper West Side also offer beer for growlers.
 That much-vaunted freshness, however, depends on how the bottle is filled. 
 ''There's always the possibility that someone may not fill the growler properly,'' said Shane Welch, founder of Sixpoint Craft Ales brewery in Brooklyn, which sells its products in stores in growler form. Most stores and bars run the beer straight from the tap to the bottle. ''If you don't fill it to the top, if you don't purge the air out of there, when you close the container it will be stale beer,'' Mr. Welch said. ''You probably have to drink it that night.''
 Mr. Granger, who says growlers constitute a large percentage of his sales, has tried to avoid that possibility. He has a system in which bottles are filled under pressure through a plastic hose to keep out oxygen. Filled that way, he said, they could stay fresh for months unopened, and three to five days when opened.
 ''Ergo, no flat beer,'' he said. ''No oxygen in the bottle, no foaming beer, no waste.'' 
 No bar tab, either.

HEADLINE: A Decaying Downtown Becomes Full of Life Again

BYLINE: By KRISTINA SHEVORY

 BODY:
Most companies have shelved expansion plans until the economy recovers -- but not the Devon Energy Corporation, one of the country's biggest independent energy companies.
 Flush with cash from the energy boom, Devon broke ground in October for a 50-story tower in Oklahoma City that is among the tallest buildings under construction nationwide. The company's new headquarters building will be the state's tallest when it opens in 2012.
 Despite the building's $750 million price, Devon is betting the new tower will save money and make the company more efficient. All of its 1,500 employees in Oklahoma City, who are now scattered in five buildings around downtown, will be in a single location. 
 The building, designed by Pickard Chilton, will have 80,000 square feet of ground floor space with retail and food, open to the public. ''It's a great time to build a building. We can get it done faster and cheaper than during the boom,'' said Larry Nichols, Devon's chief executive. ''We're ahead of schedule and under budget.''
 Devon's building, however, is not the only construction project in Oklahoma City. In December, residents approved a $777 million tax package for a 70-acre central park, convention center, streetcar system, aquatic centers, boating facilities and trails that will be built over the next nine years.
 A $140 million makeover of downtown, including new sidewalks, bicycle lanes and two-way streets, also starts in May courtesy of Devon. 
 ''We're assured of a 10-year economic stimulus plan,'' said Roy H. Williams, chief executive of the Greater Oklahoma City Chamber.
 While Devon's tower is the only office building under construction, Oklahoma City's commercial real estate market has been less affected than some markets by the downturn unfolding across the country. Rents and vacancy rates have not shown the wild swings that characterize other markets, although the vacancy rate was up to 20 percent at the end of the year, from 16.5 percent at the end of 2008, according to CB Richard Ellis, a commercial brokerage firm. 
 ''We are still strongly dominated by the oil and natural gas industry. As long as it performs, we're O.K.,'' said Jim Austin, a vice president at CB Richard Ellis in Oklahoma City. ''When everyone was tanking, we were doing well.''
 Natural gas prices have skyrocketed over the last few years, bolstered by high energy demand and technological advances that opened up previously tapped fields, and climbed to more than $14 a thousand cubic feet in July 2008. Although the recession has depressed prices, they have started to recover as energy companies close wells and reduce drilling. 
 While Devon is making a contribution, much of the revival of downtown is being financed by taxpayers, who have a history of approving taxes to improve the city. In 1993, city voters approved a temporary one-cent increase in the sales tax to redevelop the riverfront, renovate the fairgrounds and build a ballpark, sports arena, library, trolley system, and a mile-long canal. For the next 15 years, residents have voted to continue paying for renovations on all the city's public schools and the river.
 ''It's pay as you go,'' said Ronald J. Norick, who was Oklahoma City's mayor from 1987 to 1998. ''People can see where their money goes and what their money bought.''
 After the collapse of the energy boom in the early 1980s, Oklahoma City struggled for well over a decade. Unemployment was around 10 percent, the only hotel downtown was on the verge of closing and the convention center's roof leaked.
 ''Our city was dying. You could shoot a cannon at 5 p.m. and you wouldn't hit anybody,'' Mr. Norick said.
 When Oklahoma City lost bids, in quick succession, for the maintenance hubs for United and American Airlines more than a decade ago, it decided to do something about it. When Mr. Norick visited Indianapolis, he saw a lively downtown full of hotels, restaurants, cafes and people on the streets and realized that companies were going elsewhere because Oklahoma City had ''a dead downtown.''
 Over the next year, Mr. Norick worked with a small group of people to come up with what would eventually become the city's first taxpayer-financed project, or MAPS for Metropolitan Area Projects. 
 All the projects were placed downtown to attract new hotels, restaurants and other businesses.
 ''Initially, we took a city that was a nice place to live and raise a family, but was not a great place to visit,'' said the current Oklahoma City mayor, Mick Cornett. ''We've now created a city that we want to show off and we're proud of.''
 The projects have infused the city with a sense of enthusiasm and attracted more businesses downtown. 
 After a nationwide search, the American Automobile Association picked Oklahoma City for the site of its new customer service center because of its low business costs and vibrant economy, said Paula Downey, president of AAA Northern California, Nevada and Utah.
 ''What was most impressive about Oklahoma City was how well its various city departments worked together and followed through with us,'' she said. ''They're a role model for other cities.''
 Oklahoma City University is moving its law school downtown to be closer to the courthouse, legal agencies and law firms. When its $30 million renovation of a former Ford Motor factory is completed in two to three years, it will have doubled its space.
 ''We just want to be part of the downtown renaissance,'' said Tom J. McDaniel, Oklahoma City University's president.

HEADLINE: He Doth Surpass Himself: 'Avatar' Outperforms 'Titanic'

BYLINE: By MICHAEL CIEPLY

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
James Cameron's science-fiction epic ''Avatar'' has passed his ''Titanic'' to become history's highest-grossing film, with a sizable boost from higher-priced tickets for 3-D and Imax showings.
 ''Avatar,'' like other contemporary films, has also benefited from the steady inflation of ticket prices --today's average is $7.46, up from $4.69 in 1998 when ''Titanic'' was in theaters -- meaning that ''Titanic'' had to sell many more tickets to reach box-office totals like ''Avatar's.'' But ''Avatar'' remains poised to keep going for weeks if not months. 
 Through Monday its ticket sales around the world reached $1.86 billion, edging past the $1.84 billion in sales posted by ''Titanic,'' which came out in December 1997, according to figures released Tuesday by 20th Century Fox.
 Fox released ''Avatar'' around the world; it split the distribution of ''Titanic'' with Paramount Pictures.
 Through Monday ''Avatar'' took in about $554.9 million in domestic theaters, placing it just behind ''Titanic,'' with sales of $600.8 million, in the domestic box-office rankings, and just ahead of ''The Dark Knight,'' a Warner Brothers film from 2008, which took in $533.3 million.
 The performance of ''Avatar'' is particularly striking because the film -- a leading contender in this year's Oscar race -- reached its summit so quickly.
 ''In just 39 days it has eclipsed the worldwide record,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, the president of Hollywood.com's box-office division. ''That's extraordinarily impressive.''
 Mr. Dergarabedian said he thought ''Avatar'' would pass the domestic box-office mark set by ''Titanic'' by the middle of next week, and that it is almost certain to pass $2 billion in worldwide sales before the end of its run.
 Privately, some involved with the film are guessing that final ticket sales will go as high as $2.5 billion, though Fox has made no public projection. New Line Cinema's ''Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,'' No. 3 in the all-time worldwide rankings, had $1.1 billion in ticket sales, according to Boxofficemojo.com.
 Fox said 72 percent of worldwide sales for ''Avatar'' came from 3-D screens. If Mr. Dergarabedian's estimates are correct, the movie has accounted for roughly 56 million admissions in domestic theaters to date.
 That is about the same number of tickets that ''Titanic'' had sold at this point in its theatrical run, he said.
 But ''Titanic'' played and played, remaining in theaters until September 1998 and racking up about 128 million admissions. ''Avatar'' still needs a very long tail to surpass the number of viewers who saw ''Titanic.''
 To calculate the number of ''Avatar'' viewers around the world is impossible without taking into account exchange rates and a patchwork of ticket prices and viewing habits in dozens of countries in which the film has been showing.
 Large-format Imax theaters have accounted for about $137.1 million of ''Avatar'' ticket sales around the world, said Greg Foster, president and chairman of Imax Filmed Entertainment. ''There's been only the most minimal drop-off,'' he said. Imax theaters are scheduled to continue showing ''Avatar'' until ''Alice in Wonderland,'' another 3-D film, from Walt Disney, opens on March 5. 
 The world record is sweet vindication, both for Mr. Cameron and for Fox. Skeptics had questioned whether Mr. Cameron could deliver on his promise of a revolutionary visual experience, and whether Fox and its financial partners would profit from a film that cost nearly a half-billion dollars to make and release.
 While those questions are now settled -- the film will make a profit and the critics have been kind -- the Academy Awards, scheduled for March 7, remain a hurdle. On Sunday the Producers Guild of America gave its highest movie award, sometimes a harbinger of success at the Oscars, to ''The Hurt Locker.'' A small, independent drama about the Iraq war, it was directed by Kathryn Bigelow, who is Mr. Cameron's ex-wife.
 On Tuesday Tom Rothman, a chairman of the Fox film operation, said the global success of ''Avatar'' carried a lesson beyond economics. ''It tells you all of us on the planet have more things in common than we have dividing us,'' Mr. Rothman said.

HEADLINE: Shares End Lower After Early Gains

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Stocks erased gains in the session's final hour as concerns that the Federal Reserve may signal more plans to unwind stimulus measures overshadowed higher-than-estimated earnings and consumer confidence.
 JPMorgan Chase slid 2 percent, leading declines in the Dow Jones industrial average. Verizon Communications tumbled 1.7 percent after it reported revenue that trailed estimates, while the United States Steel Corporation fell 11.8 percent on a wider-than-estimated loss.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 0.42 percent, or 4.61 points, to 1,092.17. The Dow fell 2.57 points, or 0.03 percent, to 10,194.29. The Nasdaq dropped 7.07 points, or 0.32 percent, to 2,203.73. 
 ''We have the Fed meeting today and tomorrow, and this may be hesitation with investors before we know what the indications will be from the policy committee,'' said Jason Cooper, of 1st Source Investment Advisors in South Bend, Ind.
 The benchmark indexes advanced earlier after the Conference Board's confidence index increased more than estimated, to 55.9, as the labor market improved, while companies like Apple and Travelers posted earnings that topped estimates.
 The S.& P. 500, which closed at a 15-month high on Jan. 19, has slumped 5.1 percent in its biggest three-day drop in 10 months. The move erased the index's gain for the year. 
 Fed policy makers, who started a meeting in Washington on Tuesday, are expected to keep the benchmark for short-term interest rates in the zero to 0.25 percent range, where it has been since December 2008. Investors' focus has been on how and when the central bank will signal its intention to start raising rates, and to dismantle the programs by which it has financed risky assets for the banking system.
 Financial companies in the S.& P. 500 led the market's retreat, falling 1.7 percent as a group after rising as much as 1 percent earlier. JPMorgan fell to $38.44.
 Verizon reported fourth-quarter revenue that trailed analysts' estimates as rising unemployment hurt sales to business customers, and shares fell to $30.17.
 Analysts have estimated that a nine-quarter earnings slump for S.& P. 500 companies ended in the fourth quarter. More than 130 companies in the index are scheduled to report results this week.
 Per-share earnings for the S.& P. are estimated at $16.47, based on reports from 119 companies, according to Bloomberg data. That is higher than any quarterly total since the second quarter of 2008, according to Standard & Poor's. The figure compares with a full-quarter projection of $16.33 based on analyst estimates for individual companies, according to Standard & Poor's.
 About three-quarters of the companies that have reported fourth-quarter results have beaten analyst estimates for per-share earnings, according to Bloomberg data.
 ''The market's focus is shifting back to the fundamentals of companies, and frankly they're not that bad,'' said Warren Koontz, chief investment officer for large-cap value stocks at Loomis Sayles in Boston. 
 Apple gained 1.4 percent to $205.94 after earnings jumped 50 percent on record sales of Macintosh computers and iPhones. Apple reported first-quarter earnings excluding some items of $3.67 a share, 6.1 percent more than the average analyst forecast in a Bloomberg survey.
 Travelers, the insurance giant, climbed 2.7 percent, to $50.23, after it reported operating income, which excludes some investment results, of $2.12 a share, compared with the $1.48 average estimate of 18 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
 ''We're fully in the midst of an economic recovery right now,'' said Chris Hensen of MFC Global Investment Management in Toronto. ''It's healthy to bring the market down to valuation levels that people might be a little more comfortable with.'' 
 The International Monetary Fund, meanwhile on Tuesday, raised its forecast for global economic growth this year, to 3.9 percent, from a 3.1 percent projection in October. The fund predicted growth of 2.7 percent in the United States and 10 percent in China. Still, high unemployment and rising public debt will restrain growth and contain inflation, the I.M.F. said.
 The Treasury's 10-year note rose 2/32, to 98. The yield fell to 3.62 percent, from 3.63 percent late Monday.
 Following are the results of Tuesday's Treasury auctions of four-week bills and two-year notes:

HEADLINE: Pro-Wall Street Democrat Takes On a House Veteran

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER

 BODY:
She's young, she just moved into the district and she is taking on an established and popular House Democrat in a primary bid she concedes is a huge gamble. She's also a hedge fund lawyer, and proud of it.
 All that may not exactly excite liberal primary voters. But Reshma Saujani, 34, has won the backing of some prominent Democratic donors for her bid to topple Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, a challenge that is turning heads on the Upper East Side of Manhattan and antagonizing some of New York's best-known feminists.
 It is a campaign steeped in identity politics -- Ms. Saujani says she is the first Indian-American woman to run for Congress, and she is counting on South Asians to support her in droves. But perhaps more intriguing is her goal of becoming an advocate for the financial industry in the Capitol. 
 Ms. Saujani, in an interview, said she was ''running on my Wall Street record, not from it.'' She called Ms. Maloney ''asleep at the wheel'' for saying the economy was improving, and accused her and the entire New York Congressional delegation of failing to do enough to aid business. She said her hedge fund work was great preparation for representing the district, home to many of the financial industry's players, and she chided Ms. Maloney for bashing banks and calling for a 100 percent tax on some bonuses.
 ''Instead of browbeating Wall Street, I want to invite them to help create jobs,'' Ms. Saujani said, talking up an idea to connect investment houses with technology start-ups. 
 ''If you go to Texas, you'll never hear a Congressional member speak poorly of the oil industry,'' she added. ''In Michigan, you'll never hear a Congressional member speak poorly of the auto industry. This is our bread and butter.''
 For voters who do not work on Wall Street, though, Ms. Saujani's work history might remind them of the stories that have battered its reputation.
 In 2005, she helped start an investment fund for a company partly owned by Hassan Nemazee, a Democratic fund-raiser who was charged with bank fraud last year. Ms. Saujani said she left before the alleged crimes. She went to another fund started by the Carlyle Group, before it was hammered by credit-default swaps. Then she shifted to Fortress Investment Partners, which cratered in the market meltdown.
 Ms. Saujani also has a healthy sense of what a junior representative can accomplish. Asked what might have been different had she been in Congress before the financial crisis, she said, ''I think we could've seen it coming and prepared for it.''
 Told of Ms. Saujani's remarks, a spokesman for Ms. Maloney, George Arzt, had few words. ''What's her record?'' he said. ''What's her accomplishments? What's her connection to the district? There is none.''
 Ms. Saujani moved into the district last summer, when Ms. Maloney explored a run for the Senate, in hopes of leapfrogging past other elected officials who coveted the House seat. She insisted that ''age has nothing to do with'' her candidacy. But she added that a third of the district's adults were too young to vote when Ms. Maloney, 60, was first elected in 1992, and she suggested that ''there reaches a point where you have to pass the torch and give others the opportunity to lead.''
 More than a youth-in-revolt situation, though, her campaign reflects the support of some influential East Siders who are disdainful of Ms. Maloney and say they want someone with greater intellectual heft. (One of them, Maureen White, a former national finance chief for the Democratic Party and the wife of the financier Steven Rattner, has told friends she briefly considered running against Ms. Maloney herself.) 
 Boykin Curry, another financier backing Ms. Saujani, said he wanted a ''policy lion'' in the mold of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 
 ''This is the most educated district in America and one of the top contributors to candidates outside the district,'' he said. ''And we're sending someone like we're a second-rate town, who checks the box on issues and runs excellent constituent services, but who I don't think anybody would say is adding anything to the debate.''
 Ms. Saujani speaks her donors' language: her political experience is as a fund-raiser, and in 2004 she pulled together $1 million from South Asians for John Kerry. As of Dec. 31, she had raised $403,000 for a race that could cost upward of $2 million. Ms. Maloney raised less than $200,000 in the quarter but had $1.75 million on hand.
 Some Democrats see the drive to oust Ms. Maloney as curiously timed. An institution on the East Side (whose district includes a large chunk of Queens, including Astoria) she received an outpouring of sympathy when her husband of 33 years, Clifton H. W. Maloney, died in September while climbing in the Himalayas.
 Even Ms. Maloney's rivals in the New York Congressional delegation call her a relentless, effective advocate. In the past year she has won $200 million for the Second Avenue subway, pressed the case for billions in new compensation for 9/11 victims and seen the overhaul of credit-card regulations that she had championed since 2007 signed into law.
 For her part, Ms. Saujani offers a compelling immigrant's tale. Her parents lost almost everything in the early 1970s when Idi Amin expelled Indians from Uganda. They hid what few jewels they had in toothpaste and settled in Chicago after throwing a dart at a map. She made it to Yale Law School and later, at the law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell, handled asylum cases pro bono. 
 But her campaign has rankled many feminists, whose loyalty Ms. Maloney won decades ago for her work on mammograms, equal pay, reproductive rights and violence against women. 
 Marilyn Fitterman, a former state president of the National Organization for Women, appealed to Ms. Saujani in an e-mail message not to challenge Ms. Maloney ''if you care anything about women's rights.''
 Geraldine A. Ferraro, the former House member and vice-presidential candidate, also urged Ms. Saujani to wait. ''She's ending her political career before it starts,'' Ms. Ferraro said. ''That's not a threat, it's a statement of fact. You don't, if you're a Democrat, challenge an incumbent Democrat who has a position of power to get things done just because you feel like this is something you want to do.''
 Ms. Saujani, undeterred, noted that Ms. Maloney saw primaries as healthy when she considered taking on Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand. As for paying her dues and waiting, she said, ''Last time I read the Constitution, getting in line wasn't in it.''
 Then again, last July, more than 60 New Yorkers sent Ms. Maloney a letter imploring her ''not to pursue a divisive primary fight'' against Ms. Gillibrand because it would force a choice ''between two tremendously capable, hard-working women.'' Among the signatures: Ms. Saujani's.

HEADLINE: Tempers Hot as Lines Grow For Cash Wired to Haitians

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE; Marc Lacey contributed reporting from Port-au-Prince, and Jack Healy from New York.

 BODY:
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti -- Thousands of Haitians lined up at money transfer offices here on Tuesday, crowding windows and arguing with the police as they waited as long as 10 hours to collect small cash infusions wired from relatives abroad. 
 Haitian government officials said they were still trying to determine how much money was pouring in, but after two weeks without remittances because of the earthquake, there appeared to be a significant spike, which they welcomed. 
''In Boston, Chicago, Miami and New York, Haitian Americans are helping with their money and their time,'' said Elisabeth Delatour Preval, Haiti's first lady. ''They are shocked with what has happened to us.''
 Even without an earthquake, two weeks without money from abroad would push many families closer to destitution. Only a small minority in Haiti, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, have enough money for a bank account. And since the 1990s, the Haitian economy has turned increasingly reliant on cash wire transfers sent to relatives by the one to two million Haitians who have left for the United States, the Dominican Republic and other countries. 
 The World Bank has estimated that remittances make up as much as 30 percent of the country's gross domestic product, triple the level as in 1998, and more than twice the earnings from exports. 
 Each year, Haitians abroad send back more than $1.5 billion, and in small amounts: most families receive about $150 a month, according to one World Bank report. 
 The money is usually used for basic necessities, and in the aftermath of the catastrophic earthquake on Jan. 12, the need has increased along with the wait times and the tension. 
 There simply are not enough open offices. Although some companies have relaxed identification rules to expedite the process, limited electricity and access to cash, along with collapsed buildings, have kept most offices from reopening. MoneyGram International said 40 of its 130 money-transfer agents had reopened, but only 8 of those were in or around Port-au-Prince. 
 The results have been crowds and complaints. 
 At a C.A.M. money transfer office in the city's Nazon section on Tuesday afternoon, at least 300 people, in two lines running in opposite directions on a busy street, shoved, shouted and tried to stay patient. 
 Natasha George, 29, said she had been there since 3 a.m. waiting for money from her brother, who works at a money transfer office in New York. She had no idea how much cash was coming, but she knew it would not be enough: it had to be shared among her family of eight. 
 Bernadette Norbrum, 38, stood on the opposite line, shifting from foot to foot, and looking angry. She said she had come from a neighborhood on the city's edge, arriving in the dark at 4 a.m. She still had a long way to go -- about 50 people stood in front of her. And when the police walked someone closer to the door, she shouted in outrage, tossing her hands in the air. ''They're just helping their friends and family,'' she said. ''Or maybe they're getting paid.'' 
 With each passing minute, she became more anxious. She was waiting for $70 from a sister in Miami, whose 18-year-old daughter was in a local hospital, awaiting a prescription. Ms. Norbrum said she had already seen another sister die after the earthquake because she did not have money for treatment. 
 ''The problem is, I lost someone already because I couldn't get her medication,'' Ms. Norbrum said. ''Now I might lose another because of the delay.''
 Throughout the line in Nazon, and others throughout the city, the demands and frustration have been expanding ever since the first money transfer offices reopened a few days ago. 
 At another C.A.M. office on Monday, there were hundreds of people jockeying to get inside, as Haitian police officers walked a select few to the front. The crowd roared with outrage, to no avail, and those who exited brought forth another complaint. They said the transfer company was charging them a ''disaster fee'' of 10 percent. 
 ''They are stealing from us and I need it badly,'' said Louise Patricia Saint Rose, in her third day of waiting in line for money from her husband in New Jersey. ''My daughter was injured. We're sleeping in the street -- I need to buy water and food.''
 Elsewhere, the long lines held women with bandaged legs, wincing in pain; Haitians of all ages squeezed together from surging crowds behind them and mothers praying that their sons had sent $100 not $40. 
 Many were dealing with both personal and economic loss. At a Western Union office on the airport road, Chlony Jean, 33, a taxi driver who twirled his beard and spoke slowly like a philosopher, said he had not worked in 15 days because his company's employees were all killed in the earthquake. He escaped unharmed, but his daughter did not. She was only 11, named Daeshley, and she died when her school collapsed. Mr. Jean looked away. That was all he could say about her. 
 ''It's just to buy food,'' he said of the money he planned to collect. ''It's for the basic things.''
 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: A Failure to Communicate or the Wrong Message?

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
For all the questions circulating in Democratic quarters as President Obama tries to weather the worst storm of his administration, perhaps none is as succinct as this: Are the missteps at the White House rooted in message or substance?
 The Republican victory in Massachusetts last week touched off a domino effect of political setbacks for Democrats -- most notably the fate of the health care agenda -- that has prompted deep introspection in the Oval Office and across the administration. 
 When Mr. Obama presents his first State of the Union address on Wednesday evening, aides said he would accept responsibility, though not necessarily blame, for failing to deliver swiftly on some of the changes he promised a year ago. But he will not, aides said, accede to criticism that his priorities are out of step with the nation's.
 As Mr. Obama navigates a crossroads of his presidency, a moment when he signals what lessons he has drawn from his first year in office, the public posture of the White House is that any shortcomings are the result of failing to explain effectively what they were doing -- and why. He will acknowledge making mistakes in pursuit of his agenda, aides said, but will not toss the agenda overboard in search of a more popular one. 
 Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, who is close to Mr. Obama and many of his advisers, said the notion of the president accepting responsibility would probably be well received by the American people. But with growing strains of populism coming from Washington, he warned against making too drastic of a course correction.
 ''The American people want to see that you're going to make a change, but for the president it's important that he not shift radically because of one election,'' Mr. Richardson said in an interview. ''He needs to stay the course and not all of the sudden become something that he isn't. The country was very inspired by Barack Obama -- all kinds of voters. He needs to reconnect on that basis.''
 On the eve of his speech to a joint session of Congress and a prime-time television audience, Mr. Obama and a small circle of advisers huddled for extended periods on Tuesday, seeking to fine-tune the speech that would serve as a roadmap for the president and his party in a midterm election year.
 Still undecided, advisers said, was how much of the address would be devoted to health care as the prospects of finding a lifeline for the legislation seemed to be diminishing. A discussion was under way among the White House and Democratic leaders in Congress whether Mr. Obama would call for a scaled-down version of the legislation that has been the centerpiece of his domestic agenda.
 The White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, on Tuesday pointed to public opinion polls that showed a strong majority of Americans support many of the specific proposals inside the overall health care plan, but opposed the plan because of the messy legislative process surrounding the bill.
 ''Obviously the legislation became a caricature of its component parts,'' Mr. Gibbs said. ''To the degree that's a communications failing, I think, people here at the White House and others would certainly take responsibility for that.''
 The State of the Union address, which is Mr. Obama's third appearance before a joint session of Congress, offers an opportunity for the president to restate the goals of his administration as he tries to turn the election-year conversation to the economy. The speech will be punctuated with a handful of new ideas -- calling for a spending freeze on a portion of the domestic budget -- but aides said it would largely be an opportunity for Mr. Obama to return to the proposals that swept him into office.
 ''Democrats are really looking for that spark again,'' said David Young, chairman of the North Carolina Democratic Party. ''We feel like we may be off track and we're looking for the president to come out with bold initiatives and to lead.''
 It remained an open question, though, how Mr. Obama's initiatives would be received, even among those in his own party, and whether his speech would provide the spark that Democrats like Mr. Young and others are yearning for. His suggestion to place a freeze on some spending -- at odds with his views from the presidential campaign -- was already being met with skepticism on Tuesday.
 The White House has offered a preview of several initiatives in the days leading up to Wednesday, including a series of measures intended to provide financial relief to the middle class.
 But advisers to the president said the speech would not contain a laundry list of new programs, suggesting that the message and not the substance would be receiving the largest makeover in an effort to ease the political unrest that has set in across the Democratic Party.
 Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., in a speech on Tuesday to top party contributors in Washington, dismissed the political worrying among Democrats. He said the loss of the party's 60-vote supermajority in the Senate could actually have an up side and raise the burden for Republicans ''to be accountable as well.''
 ''The reports of our demise are premature. It's time that everybody takes a deep breath,'' Mr. Biden said. He added, ''When we had 60 votes, there was the expectation left, right and center that we could do everything we wanted to do, which was never realistic. Never.''

 Re ''Obama's Credibility Gap'' (column, Jan. 26): 
 Bob Herbert's column is very much on target. As each day passes, there are more questions and concerns about what our president really stands for and whether Barack Obama can truly lead this country toward a better future. 
 For many of us, there is a growing fear that we will look back on this period and conclude that President Obama was our greatest hope -- and our biggest disappointment. 
 Shawn Ettingoff Superior, Colo., Jan. 26, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Re Bob Herbert's Jan. 26 column:
 Yes, Virginia, Barack Obama may not be who we thought he was! 
 In 2008 it appeared to many of us that a knight in shining armor had come out of nowhere to give us hope again. He spoke eloquently and seemed to indicate that if elected his presidency would be different. 
 While we were disappointed in his early appointments and doubted that Timothy F. Geithner and Lawrence H. Summers were in tune with a new vision, we gave our new president the benefit of the doubt. 
 When he increased the number of troops in Afghanistan, we said we did not have all the facts and perhaps he knew something that demanded an escalation. 
 Now we look to his State of the Union address on Wednesday night. We are hopeful and optimistic. We want President Obama to succeed, and yes, we believe that he will, though it takes time; and we will go down a better road for the country, and all of us who come out of the 1960s will once again feel that anything is possible.
 Jennifer Dorn New York, Jan. 26, 2010
 To the Editor:
 In ''Don't Give Up Now'' (editorial, Jan. 26), you write, in connection with health care reform, that President Obama and Congressional Democrats have ''clearly failed to explain why reform will make Americans' lives more secure -- not less.''
 Yes, a mighty big failure. And a perplexing one, too, in the case of the president. I wish you'd gone on to wonder why oh why he hasn't even once emulated President Franklin D. Roosevelt's ''fireside chats.'' Roosevelt spoke directly to the American people, from the White House, explaining complicated issues in simple language. Thus he gained vast public support.
 President Obama would be at his best in such direct, person-to-person, demystifying talks. Instead, he stands on a podium in front of large audiences in formal settings (like the coming State of the Union address) and sounds sincere and earnest, heart in the right place, but somewhat remote and not the least bit enlightening.
 What a missed opportunity.
 Joel Raphaelson Chicago, Jan. 26, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Those of us who supported President Obama will not forgive him for failure to deliver on his promise of health care reform. He needs to demonstrate the fortitude and leadership that are required in this highly partisan era of politics.
 He should realize that the Republicans are going to try to block everything he does. To avoid his Waterloo, he should urge Congress to pass the Senate health reform bill in its present form and address any misgivings by House members with separate legislation. 
 Show some guts, twist arms and explain the benefits of reform on TV to the public.
 President Bush didn't hesitate to pass tax cuts for the wealthy using reconciliation. So why has this president allowed Congress to deter him from honoring his campaign pledge to reform health care? No guts, no glory and no health care reform.
 Tom Minnerick Elgin, Ill., Jan. 26, 2010
 To the Editor: 
 Re ''Obama Summons Team From 2008 for Races in Fall'' (front page, Jan. 24):
 Some recommendations to President Obama about the midterms:
 Read less about ''Team of Rivals'' and Abraham Lincoln, and more about Franklin D. Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan, whose common touches with ''forgotten Americans'' gave both of them the popularity and ability to act decisively. 
 Look straight at the television cameras -- that is, at the American people.
 Unite the country, as both Roosevelt and Reagan did, on the issue all of us Americans agree on: economic growth and jobs. Reagan didn't try to advance the divisive social agenda of his ''base,'' but instead common national goals. 
 Cultivate a common touch. It is not the more remote Democrats (like Walter F. Mondale, Michael S. Dukakis, John Kerry and Al Gore) who win, but populists like Harry S. Truman, Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton. 
 And it is leaders with the common touch, who celebrate America's common civic and religious heritage, and focus like Roosevelt and Reagan on economic growth and jobs, who will win elections and successfully establish the agenda for the nation. 
 President Obama was elected to focus on jobs and the economy, and it is still early enough before the midterm elections -- if they can get all this right, the common touch, above all -- for the president and the Democrats to re-establish their initiative and momentum.

HEADLINE: Yahoo Swings to a Profit as Its Revenue Slide Continues

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
Yahoo announced Tuesday its best quarterly financial performance since it hired Carol A. Bartz as chief executive a year ago. Ms. Bartz has been vowing since her arrival to engineer a turnaround that eluded her two predecessors, Terry Semel and Jerry Yang. 
 Yahoo reported net income of $153 million, or 11 cents a share, in the fourth quarter. It reported a loss of $303 million in the same quarter a year earlier.
 If not for charges tied to a proposed search partnership with Microsoft, Yahoo said it would have made 15 cents a share in the quarter. That topped the average estimate of 11 cents a share among analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. 
 Yahoo's revenue fell 4 percent, to $1.73 billion. Yahoo's revenue has now declined in five consecutive quarters. 
 ''The fourth quarter marked a strong finish to 2009, which was a transformative year for Yahoo,'' said Ms. Bartz in a prepared statement.
 Yahoo's forecast for the current quarter calls for revenue growth to resume during the three months ending in March.
 Yahoo shares dipped 19 cents in extended trading after the release of results, which came after the Sunnyvale, Calif., company finished Tuesday's regular session at $15.99, up 13 cents.
 Yahoo had been struggling even before the recession's onset in December 2007, as Google widened its lead in the Internet's lucrative search market.
 Since her arrival, Ms. Bartz has been trying to re-establish Yahoo as the center of people's online lives. The makeover has included a redesigned front page that makes it easier to connect to Facebook and other Internet services. 
 Yahoo is spending more than $100 million on marketing campaign scheduled to last through 2010.
 Yahoo also plans to reduce its expenses further by hiring Microsoft to power its search engine and the advertising tied to the search requests. The partnership would allow Yahoo to keep 88 percent of the revenue from the search ads clicked on its Web site while Microsoft would shoulder most of the costs for the technology. 
 The benefits from the alliance are expected to be reflected in Yahoo's results during the second half of this year, if the alliance wins regulatory approval as expected.

HEADLINE: Vote on Bernanke Confirmation Is Scheduled for Thursday

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Ben S. Bernanke's prospects for confirmation to a second term as chairman of the Federal Reserve advanced on Tuesday as the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, scheduled a crucial vote in the process for Thursday. 
 The scheduling of the vote, which would end debate on the confirmation hearing, signals that Mr. Reid believes he has the 60 votes needed to overcome a threatened filibuster. 
 It is possible that some senators may vote to close debate but then vote against the confirmation, which requires a simple majority. Mr. Bernanke's four-year term expires on Sunday. 
 In a sign of the political strain that has engulfed the Fed, Mr. Bernanke found himself juggling policy and politics on Tuesday.
 He presided at the start of a two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets the nation's monetary policy. Most economists expect the committee to leave the federal funds rate, the rate at which banks lend to each other overnight, close to zero, as the central bank continues to try to stimulate economic recovery.
 Mr. Bernanke also tried to rally support for his cause, speaking by phone with Senators Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, and Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee. Officials in the Obama administration, including the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, and the White House chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, have been trying to raise support for Mr. Bernanke since late last week, when his nomination suddenly appeared to falter. 
 Even so, criticism of Mr. Bernanke persisted on Tuesday.
 Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, told The Des Moines Register that he would vote against Mr. Bernanke. He cited the 2008 bailout of the American International Group, which amounted to $180 billion, asserting that Mr. Bernanke ''provided too much money, with no conditions.'' 
 And Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, told reporters that Mr. Bernanke ''was the captain of the ship when it hit the iceberg.''

HEADLINE: One In Five Report Hunger

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE

 BODY:
Nearly one in five Americans said they lacked the money to buy food at some point in the last year, according to a survey co-sponsored by the Gallup organization and released by an anti-hunger group. The numbers soared at the start of the current recession, but dipped in 2009 despite the continuing rise in unemployment. The anti-hunger group, the Food Research and Action Center, attributed that trend to falling food prices, rising enrollment for food stamps and an increase in the amount of the food stamp benefit. More than 38 million Americans -- one in eight-- now receive food stamps, a record high.

HEADLINE: An Underdog Who Isn't Daunted by a New Try for the Senate

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD

 BODY:
The long shot ate breakfast with his mother. She asked for campaign buttons for her friends. He handed her a dozen. She got worried. That many? Weren't they expensive? Calm down, Mom, he said, they're cheap.
 How could she not worry? Most of the long shot's time was spent drumming up money so he could be elected United States senator from New York. 
 He recently took a leave from his job to campaign full-time for the Democratic nomination. When he worked, he made $110,000 a year. Now: zero.
 The long shot's campaign chest was in the vicinity of $100,000. 
 It is what it is. Jonathan Tasini knows that. Last time around, pitted against Hillary Rodham Clinton, he was the 17 percent man, gathering that percentage of the vote in the 2006 Democratic primary. He settled back into his day job as a consultant for labor unions.
 That was O.K. As he put it now, ''There was not one day that I thought I would win.''
 Now it's primary time again, and the long shot is back in business.
 This time, persuaded of broad voter furor, Mr. Tasini believes he has a legitimate chance, with his progressive views and a resume of never having held political office. Provided, that is, he can assemble much more money -- he's thinking $1 million to $10 million. If he does, he actually feels he will not only win, but also, it will not be close. 
 Sometimes long shots need to think that way. 
 Right now, he appreciates that most people do not even know he is running. He declared his candidacy in June.
 It might have been more pleasurable going alone against Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, no powerhouse on the order of Mrs. Clinton. But this month Harold E. Ford Jr., the Tennessee transplant, began floating his candidacy. With two names now in the headlines, well, it can get lonely being the long shot.
 Even a lot of admirers won't predict a good ending. 
 When a Marist poll on the race came out this month, the results were Ms. Gillibrand, 43 percent; Mr. Ford 24 percent; undecided 33 percent. Mr. Tasini was not even a choice.
 Mr. Tasini's reaction? ''Terrific.''
 He pointed out that the poll demonstrated that most people did not support the senator and a quarter supported someone who had not yet joined the race. Made him feel the nomination could be his.
 When the Massachusetts Senate race unexpectedly went Republican a week ago, Mr. Tasini interpreted it as voter contempt for insiders.
 ''People who say the long shot, they lack imagination,'' he said. ''My question back to them is when will be enough? When will be enough not to vote for these insiders?'' 
 He is 53 and single, with frameless glasses and thinning dark hair practically ironed to his head. 
 Views: He is against the health care bill, and wants Medicare for all. He is against the dual wars (''I will not vote for a single penny to continue either war''). He wants to increase the minimum wage immediately to $10 an hour and see it quickly reach $15 to $20. He wants a stronger labor movement. (''People say you're antibusiness. I'm pro-business because I want jobs. What I'm against is foolishness.'') He wants a tax on every transaction on Wall Street. He supports gay marriage and gun control. 
 As for Ms. Gillibrand, he said: ''She has brought no vision for the country. If you want someone to tinker around the edges, you should vote for her.''
 Some people who know him think he is dauntless. Some think he is a self-promoter. Some don't know what to think.
 Tim Carpenter, the national director of Progressive Democrats of America, said, ''His message is already resonating with the progressive community.''
 Ed Ott, who teaches about labor issues at the City University of New York's Murphy Institute for Worker Education and Labor Studies, said: ''The money is too intimidating. He's got too tall a mountain to climb.''
 Mr. Tasini's father was from the British-ruled Palestine Mandate and became an electrical engineer. His mother was born in Poland and is a psychiatrist. Mr. Tasini was born in Houston, lived in cities and towns throughout New York and in Israel, got a degree in political science from the University of California, Los Angeles, then devoted himself to the labor movement. 
 For a long time, he led the National Writers Union. He successfully sued The New York Times and other publishers on behalf of freelance writers. For the last three years, he has been the executive director of the Labor Research Association, a union strategy group.
 Mr. Tasini met for lunch recently at the trendy Odeon in TriBeCa with Philip DePaolo, director of the New York Community Council, an advocacy group, and Michael D. D. White, a real estate lawyer and urban planner. 
 The long shot pitched himself: ''We are at a watershed moment.''
 Mr. DePaolo said he thought he could win. 
 Mr. White was noncommittal.
 Mr. Tasini doesn't own a car. His apartment in Washington Heights rents for less than $1,000. He rides a bike and the subway.
 One of his few indulgences is season tickets to the Yankees -- grandstand level.
 He asked the two men, ''Am I going to lose a lot of votes on the Yankees thing?''
 Mr. DePaolo: ''I've been boycotting the new stadium.''
 Mr. Tasini: ''I think this may be the toughest thing to overcome of the vision stuff.''
 Mr. Tasini headed to Staten Island. With an entourage numbering one, he rode the ferry -- New York's free ride -- silhouetted against the city's twinkling lights. When Harold Ford traveled there once, he took a helicopter. 
 An evening fund-raiser awaited at the St. George Parish Grill. The suggested contribution was $50. About 35 people showed up, hors d'oeuvres circling the room.
 He spoke to a recently unemployed chef. Mr. Tasini told him he wanted to learn to really cook. 
 He spoke to a production person from the television show ''Mercy'' who wanted to know where he was on animal rights. Mr. Tasini said he used to have a cat, but it died, and he's all for animal rights.
 He told the crowd: ''They're giving out bonuses on Wall Street as if nothing has happened. It's the modern-day version of Marie Antoinette: let them eat cake.''
 He talked some more. The night wore on. He grabbed some food. Long shots eat, too.

HEADLINE: Gillibrand Lashes Out At Remarks From Ford

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand sharply objected Tuesday to Harold E. Ford Jr.'s characterization of her as ''a parakeet'' and accused him of engaging in a ''fraudulent'' campaign for her Senate seat.
 Ms. Gillibrand's remarks came a day after Mr. Ford appeared on an Albany radio show and suggested that she lacked the independence to be a senator. 
 ''Understand that you're not elected to the United States Senate to be a parakeet or to take instructions from the Democratic leadership,'' Mr. Ford said, a jab at Ms. Gillibrand, who was appointed to the Senate last year to fill the seat vacated by Hillary Rodham Clinton.
 In response, during an interview on Tuesday, Ms. Gillibrand depicted Mr. Ford, a former representative from Tennessee, as a political scion who had benefited handsomely from his ties to powerful insiders. Although he is positioning himself as an outsider, she said, he inherited his father's Congressional seat and runs the Democratic Leadership Council, a centrist policy group that is a major player in Washington. 
 ''It is fraudulent for him to claim he is an outsider,'' she said. ''He literally grew up in Washington, D.C., while his father was a congressman. And then he waltzes into his father's Congressional seat and now is a vice chairman of Merrill Lynch.''
 ''On top of that, he runs the most insider Democratic organization, the D.L.C,'' she said, continuing, ''For him to say he is an outsider and an independent is laughable.''
 The tart comments from both sides suggest that a Democratic primary between the two would be quite a rumpus. It is highly unusual for a United States senator to directly attack a rival who is not even officially in the race, let alone with such personal edge.
 But Ms. Gillibrand made clear that she thought Mr. Ford had crossed a line in his attacks on Monday. ''I wouldn't accept name-calling from my 6-year-old,'' Ms. Gillibrand, a mother of two boys, said. ''He needs to drop the name-calling and focus on things that matter.''
 Mr. Ford was not chastened. ''Of course the unelected senator is on the attack,'' said Davidson Goldin, a Ford spokesman. ''Her approval numbers are rock bottom, unemployment is rising and the economy around the state isn't improving on her watch.''
 Ms. Gillibrand and her advisers appear to increasingly view Mr. Ford as a serious threat as he moves closer to a decision about whether to run.
 And national party leaders, including White House officials, appear similarly concerned.
 At a closed-door meeting Tuesday of top party officials and fund-raisers at the Mandarin Oriental hotel in Washington, Patrick Gaspard, the White House political director, stressed that the White House is vigorously supporting Ms. Gillibrand, according to attendees.
 ''The message was clear that the White House wants everyone to get behind her,'' said one of the attendees, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the discussions in the meeting were meant to be private. ''The White House clearly cares about this race.''
 Ms. Gillibrand's supporters, including Senator Charles E. Schumer, have nudged several would-be Democratic challengers out of the race, worried that a protracted primary campaign would damage the party's ability to hold on to the seat in the general election.
 But the intervention of Ms. Gillibrand's supporters has not been enough to scare off Mr. Ford, an ambitious politician who moved to New York three years ago after his failed 2006 run for the Senate in Tennessee.
 Mr. Ford has said that he will decide whether to challenge Ms. Gillibrand by the end of next month. In the meantime, he has acted like a candidate, embarking on a statewide tour that has led Ms. Gillibrand's advisers to conclude that he is more likely than not to enter the race.

HEADLINE: Advocates of Climate Bill Scale Down Their Goals

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER and CLIFFORD KRAUSS; John M. Broder reported from Washington, and Clifford Krauss from Houston.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
As they watch President Obama's ambitious health care plan crumble, the advocates of a comprehensive bill to combat global warming are turning their sights to a more modest package of climate and energy measures that they believe has a better chance of clearing Congress this year.
 Their preferred approach, a cap-and-trade system to curb emissions of climate-changing gases, already faced a difficult road in a bruised and divided Senate. Its prospects grew dimmer after the special election in Massachusetts last week was won by Scott Brown, a Republican who repudiated the federal cap-and-trade proposal in his campaign. 
 Republicans, industry executives and some Democrats have already written cap and trade's obituary, at least for this year. And even some of the system's most ardent supporters now say they must scale back their ambitions and focus on job-creating energy projects and energy efficiency measures if they are to have any hope of dealing with climate change in this Congress.
 ''Realistically, the cap-and-trade bills in the House and the Senate are going nowhere,'' said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who is trying to fashion a bipartisan package of climate and energy measures. ''They're not business-friendly enough, and they don't lead to meaningful energy independence.''
 Mr. Graham said the public was demanding that any energy legislation from Washington focus on creating jobs, whether by drilling for offshore oil or building wind turbines. 
 ''What is dead is some massive cap-and-trade system that regulates carbon in a fashion that drives up energy costs,'' he said.
 Mr. Graham's opinion matters because he has been the only Republican willing to work with Democratic senators on some form of climate change legislation. He said that the price of attracting Republican and business support was to use the legislation to provide incentives for building nuclear power plants, stepped-up domestic oil and gas exploration and subsidies for reducing carbon dioxide emissions from coal.
 White House officials continue to insist on a broad approach to climate and energy, including a cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions that encompasses the entire economy. They are also pressing forward with Environmental Protection Agency regulation of emissions of heat-trapping gases over the virtually unanimous opposition of Republicans in the House and Senate.
 ''There continues to be very strong support among a range of legislators for comprehensive climate legislation that includes cap and trade,'' Gary Guzy, the deputy director of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, said at a conference last week.
 Another White House official, who insisted on anonymity to avoid overshadowing the State of the Union address, said President Obama would restate his commitment to a bill that addresses global warming along with measures to increase energy efficiency and clean-energy technology.
 The official said the White House would support legislation that provided incentives for oil and gas drilling and for construction of nuclear plants, as well as provisions that helped industries that use a lot of energy and were vulnerable to foreign competitors.
 But the president will also insist that any legislation also contain some form of cap on emissions of heat-trapping gases to make good on his pledge to reduce global warming pollution by 17 percent over 2005 levels by 2020.
 ''At the end of the day, any and all ideas are on the table because the clock is ticking,'' the official said. 
 Senator John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat who is working with Mr. Graham and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, to try to knit together a global warming and energy measure, said this week that the political climate in Washington was already harsh and had worsened with the special election in his home state. Mr. Kerry said he had held talks with the White House, business leaders and fellow senators in hopes of finding an approach to climate and energy issues that can win enough votes for passage.
 ''I can't tell you whether it will happen this year or not,'' Mr. Kerry said. ''But it's going to happen. It is inevitable that the United States will deal with climate and energy. The sooner you do it, the cheaper it is.''
 Some leaders in the energy industry were almost gleeful in pronouncing cap and trade dead for the year. They see an opportunity to win support from Congress for their businesses and to delay indefinitely the costs of reducing pollution from heat-trapping gases.
 ''Reality is hitting, and the reality is the American people are interested in jobs, not extreme legislation,'' said Larry Nichols, chief executive of Devon Energy and chairman of the American Petroleum Institute. ''Because of the shift in raw political power, there now has to be compromise.''
 A bill that has the support of Senator Harry Reid, the Democratic leader, and some senior Congressional Republicans, would offer tax incentives to bus and truck fleets to switch to natural gas, a fuel that emits less carbon dioxide than diesel. Some energy industry leaders are also looking for additional money for so-called clean-coal research and energy efficiency measures for buildings.
 Two senators, Maria Cantwell of Washington, a Democrat, and Susan Collins of Maine, a Republican, have proposed a system known as ''cap and dividend'' under which power plants, steel mills, refineries and other major carbon emitters would have to pay for permits to pollute, with all of the money being rebated to consumers to cover the higher costs of energy and manufactured goods. 
 Another option, but one largely opposed by most businesses, is regulation by the E.P.A. Mr. Obama has repeatedly said that he would much prefer a market-based cap-and-trade system to top-down mandates from the E.P.A.
 The partisan gridlock that hobbled health care overhaul could be repeated if the administration and Democratic leaders try to ram through a sweeping measure to rein in carbon emissions and remake the nation's energy economy, said Paul Bledsoe of the National Commission on Energy Policy, a bipartisan advisory group.
 ''If cap and trade becomes a political anathema,'' Mr. Bledsoe said, ''the consequences are very broad. If it is seen as divisive or politically suicidal, it could be discredited as the vehicle for dealing with climate change for the foreseeable future.''

HEADLINE: Congress's Team: Deal for Merger Included Saints

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR. 
E-mail: sandor@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The Saints' advance to the Super Bowl has been a lesson in patience. New Orleans has hosted the Super Bowl nine times, but the Saints have never played in one since entering the N.F.L. in 1967. Carol Channing made it to the Super Bowl twice, as a halftime entertainer, each time at Tulane Stadium, the first home of the Saints.
 The team survived the upheaval caused by Hurricane Katrina and speculation that the owner, Tom Benson, might take it to another city. But the team might not be in New Orleans had Representative Hale Boggs, a Louisiana Democrat, not helped maneuver legislation through Congress. 
 ''Wasn't that a great game?'' Boggs's daughter Cokie Roberts, an ABC News and NPR correspondent, said Monday from Bethesda, Md., referring to the Saints' overtime victory Sunday over Minnesota to win the National Football Conference title. ''I was just screaming my head off.''
 David F. Dixon, a local entrepreneur who led the effort to bring a franchise to New Orleans, was just as thrilled, but a heart problem kept him from attending the game at the Louisiana Superdome. ''I watched every second of it on television,'' he said Monday from New Orleans, ''and it was just a great, great experience.''
 The Saints were the offspring of Congressional approval of the National Football League-American Football League merger in 1966. And it was Boggs, the House majority whip at the time, who guided passage of a law that granted the leagues the limited immunity from antitrust laws that they needed to merge.
 ''He was pleased that they pulled it off,'' Roberts said in a telephone interview. ''He was majority whip and Russell Long was majority whip of the Senate. If they couldn't do it, who could?'' Long was a powerful senator from Louisiana; he and Boggs served on the House-Senate conference committee that crafted the bill.
 Dixon had staged extraordinarily well-attended N.F.L. exhibition games at Tulane Stadium, but he wanted something much bigger. ''I always knew New Orleans was a great football town, way back to the 1930s,'' he said. He persuaded Tulane to be the home of the future Saints. He and the older Boggs had been fraternity brothers at the university.
 The leagues announced their merger in June 1966 but needed the blessing of Congress. Emanuel Celler, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, opposed change, and Pete Rozelle, the N.F.L. commissioner, needed to execute a legislative end run.
 ''Pete called me and said, 'Dave, what can you do to help?' '' Dixon said. ''I said, 'Pete, there are two prominent guys who can be of huge help, and I'm pretty sure I can get their support if I talk to them, and that's Hale Boggs and Russell Long.' '' Boggs, he added, needed a jolt to his popularity, which was hurt by his support for the 1965 Voting Rights Act.
 Dixon said he sent a public relations adviser, David Kleck, who had worked for Boggs, to Washington ''with a full set of instructions'' about what to say to the majority whip. ''Hale said he could support it, and he stood firm, so we were able to overcome Celler's opposition through Hale and Russell being on the Senate Finance Committee.''
 In his book ''America's Game: The Epic Story of How Pro Football Captured a Nation,'' Michael MacCambridge wrote that the N.F.L. was already looking to expand to New Orleans and offered Boggs the swap of a franchise for the antitrust exemption.
 Boggs was serious enough about the deal to blow up at Rozelle before the conference committee's vote on the legislation, which was one of many riders to an anti-inflation bill that was expected to pass. According to MacCambridge, as Rozelle and Boggs walked to the Capitol Rotunda, Rozelle said he did not know how to thank Boggs.
 ''What do you mean you don't know how to thank me?'' Boggs said. ''New Orleans gets an immediate franchise in the N.F.L.''
 Rozelle waffled ever so little, saying he would do everything he could.
 ''Well, we can always call off the vote while you -- '' Boggs said.
 ''It's a deal, Congressman,'' Rozelle said. ''You'll get your franchise.''
 Boggs's son, Thomas, was then a 26-year-old tax lawyer. (''Rozelle tried to hire me,'' he said, to help get the legislation passed.) On Monday he described the quid pro quo. Boggs said that during a break in the committee's hearing, ''my old man was out in the hall with Rozelle, and Rozelle asked, 'Have you done anything with our amendment?' and my father said, 'Have you done anything with my team?' ''
 At another point, Boggs said, Rozelle sent a note into the committee room telling the elder Boggs that he had polled N.F.L. owners and that they had ''approved of New Orleans.''
 ''And the committee approved the exemption,'' said Boggs, a partner in the Washington law firm Patton Boggs. 
 He said that until his father died in a light plane crash six years later he bragged about getting a team for New Orleans. 
 ''He'd take all the credit,'' he said, ''and fight Long for it. They'd both deserve it.''

HEADLINE: State of the Union, in Dutch

 BODY:
Americans tend to think of the State of the Union as our singular event. But while it is a special night, it's not unique. In fact, leaders around the world deliver a yearly address in which they step onto the podium to score points, lay out agendas and offer up a flourish or two. So how does American rhetoric measure up? Read the following excerpts (taken from official transcripts and translations of speeches given in the last few months), listen to the president tonight and then decide.
 Russia President Dmitri Medvedev Address to the Federal Assembly Nov. 12, 2009 (11,944 words)
 Citizens of Russia... the foundation of my vision for the future is the firm conviction that Russia can and must become a global power on a completely new basis. Our country's prestige and national prosperity cannot rest forever on past achievements. After all, the oil and gas production facilities that generate most of our budget revenue, the nuclear weapons that guarantee our security, and our industrial and utilities infrastructure -- most of this was built by Soviet specialists. In other words, it was not we who built it. It is still keeping our country afloat today, but it is rapidly depreciating both morally and physically. The time has come for today's generation of Russians to make their mark .... 
 Today we are talking about modernization -- this is the essential aspect of my address today -- about our desire to be modern. We must remember of course that modernity is a fluid notion. It is not a final stage of progress at which point you can rest and relax, as we say -- quite the contrary. A truly modern society is the one that seeks constant renewal, continuous evolutionary transformation of social practices, democratic institutions, visions of the future.... 
 I note that in August this year, Russia registered its natural population increase for the first time in the last 15 years. This growth is still only small -- just 1,000 people -- but still, it is an increase nonetheless. This result was achieved above all thanks to the National Project on Health and the new demographic policy we have been implementing....
 Go, Russia!
 Norway Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg New Year's Address Jan. 1, 2010 (2,045 words)
 Among the first public buildings we know of from the earliest civilizations are granaries. They were used to provide emergency relief in years when crops failed. We remember the story of Joseph advising Pharaoh to build up a store of grain because the seven good years would be followed by seven years of famine. This is ancient wisdom: we should save when times are good so as to be prepared for hard times. 
 Over the last year, the world has experienced the most severe economic crisis since the 1930s. 
 This international crisis has also affected Norway. We have a small, open economy, and half of what we produce is sold abroad. When export markets disappear, people at home are hit. Some of those who used to manufacture car components, smelt aluminum or build ships lost their jobs because people abroad stopped buying these goods. 
 Losing a job is first and foremost a blow for the person concerned. But unemployment also harms the community. With fewer people producing goods, there is less to go round. During this crisis, we have injected a great deal of extra funds to keep the wheels in motion. We have been able to spend more during these difficult times because we were careful when times were good. In this respect, you could say that we have followed the advice Joseph gave to Pharaoh, albeit in a rather different way. The Egyptians built granaries. We built the Government Pension Fund Global. 
 Britain Queen Elizabeth II Speech From the Throne Nov. 18, 2009 (735 words)
 My lords and members of the House of Commons, my government's overriding priority is to ensure sustained growth to deliver a fair and prosperous economy for families and businesses as the British economy recovers from the global economic downturn.... 
 The Duke of Edinburgh and I look forward to our visit to Bermuda and our state visit to Trinidad and Tobago and to the Commonwealth heads of government meeting in this, the Commonwealth's 60th anniversary year. We also look forward to receiving the president of South Africa next year. ...
 My government will continue to work closely with the devolved administrations in the interests of all the people of the United Kingdom. My government is committed to the Northern Ireland political process and will continue to work with Northern Ireland's leaders to complete the devolution of policing and justice and to ensure its success.
 In Scotland, my government will take forward proposals in the final report from the Commission on Scottish Devolution. My government will continue to devolve more powers to Wales.... 
 My government will work for security, stability and prosperity in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and for peace in the Middle East. Legislation will be brought forward to ban cluster munitions....
 My lords and members of the House of Commons, I pray that the blessing of Almighty God may rest upon your counsels.
 The Netherlands Queen Beatrix Speech From the Throne Sept. 15, 2009 (1,574 words)
 Members of the States-General ... the economic recession has exposed ethical shortcomings in the way market and society operate. The government has identified flaws in the financial sector both inside and outside the Netherlands, and drawn up proposals for stricter standards and better supervision. Binding agreements will be made on limiting excessive salaries and bonuses.
 In these difficult times, the government believes it is important to continue working toward a society in which people feel a sense of togetherness, respect one another and share responsibility. A good upbringing and good education are the foundation of responsible citizenship.
 Over the past two years, the government has taken measures to promote social cohesion, safety and security, stability and mutual respect. A persistent, multiyear approach is required to achieve results. The government will therefore continue to devote special attention to youth and young people, civic integration and vulnerable neighborhoods in the big cities.
 The lack of integration of certain groups in society, widespread disrespectful and offensive behavior in public places and criminal behavior by groups of young people are stubborn problems that cause a great deal of annoyance. The government is therefore not only taking consistent action against offenders but also tackling the causes of unacceptable behavior. 
 Philippines President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo State of the Nation Address July 27, 2009 (4,373 words)
 A few days ago Moody's upgraded our credit rating, citing the resilience of our economy. The state of our nation is a strong economy. Good news for our people, bad news for our critics.
 I did not become president to be popular. To work, to lead, to protect and preserve our country, our people -- that is why I became president. When my father left the presidency, we were second to Japan. I want our republic to be ready for the first world in 20 years.... To those who want to be president, this advice: If you really want something done, just do it. Do it hard, do it well. Don't pussyfoot. Don't pander. And don't say bad words in public. ...
 We inherited the longest-running communist insurgency in the world. Leah de la Cruz is one of 12,000 rebel returnees. She was only 16 when she joined the New People's Army.... She was captured in 2006. She is now involved in an L.G.U.-supported handicraft livelihood training of former rebels. We love you, Leah!...
 We inherited an age-old conflict in Mindanao, exacerbated by a politically popular but near-sighted policy of massive retaliation.... There is nothing more that I would wish for than peace in Mindanao. It will be a blessing for all its people, Muslim, Christian and indigenous peoples. It will show other religiously divided communities that there can be common ground on which to live together in peace, harmony and cooperation. 
 South Africa President Jacob Zuma State of the Nation Address June 3, 2009 (4,545 words)
 Fellow South Africans ...since 1994 we have sought to create a united cohesive society out of our fragmented past. We are called upon to continue this mission of promoting unity in diversity. ... We must develop a common attachment to our country, our Constitution and the national symbols. In this spirit, we will promote the national anthem and our country's flag and all other national symbols.
 Our children, from an early age, must be taught to pay allegiance to the Constitution and the national symbols, and know what it means to be South African citizens. ... 
 Sport is a powerful nation-building tool. Working together we must support all our national teams from Bafana Bafana to the Proteas and the Springboks; from Banyana Banyana to Paralympians.
 Our teams can only do well with our support. Allow me to use this opportunity to congratulate our national teams for their performances in the past week, indeed in pulling off a hat trick. The country's women's netball team has done us proud by winning the Tri-Nations Netball Challenge. Congratulations to the Sevens Springboks who have become the I.R.B. Sevens World Series champions -- and not forgetting the Blue Bulls who have won the Super 14 finals in a convincing fashion!
 We take this opportunity to wish the Springboks well in the upcoming series against the British and Irish Lions.

HEADLINE: China Leads Better-Than-Expected Global Recovery

BYLINE: By BRIAN KNOWLTON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The global recovery has been more vigorous than expected, led by 10 percent growth in China, the International Monetary Fund said Tuesday. But the recovery in developed economies will be weak by historical standards, with continued high unemployment, and will probably slow next year, the fund said. 
 Gross domestic product in the United States will expand 2.7 percent this year -- a significant improvement from the 1.5 percent growth predicted in October -- but will probably slow to 2.4 percent next year, the report said.
 In an update of its World Economic Outlook report, the I.M.F. said that the global economy would expand 3.9 percent this year, sharply higher than the 3.1 percent it had predicted as recently as October. The fund's analysts expect economic growth worldwide of 4.3 percent next year.
 ''The global recovery is off to a stronger start than anticipated earlier, but is proceeding at different speeds in the various regions,'' the I.M.F. said. 
 Given the fragility of recovery, the fund urged the full application of stimulus measures planned for this year. 
 The monetary fund expected growth of 10 percent in China this year, up from 8.7 percent last year, as the country's economy leads a broader Asian recovery. Emerging economies in Asia will probably grow at an average 8.4 percent pace this year and next, a strong improvement over last year's 6.5 percent rate, the report said. 
 The managing director of the I.M.F., Dominique Strauss-Kahn, spoke recently in Hong Kong of ''a historic moment for Asia,'' as some countries there moved rapidly ''to identify the key elements of a new model that can deliver sustained growth.'' 
 Advanced economies are expected to return to a growth rate of 2.1 percent this year, after a contraction 3.2 percent in 2009. But ''the recovery in advanced economies is still expected to be weak by historical standards, with real output remaining below its precrisis level until late 2011,'' the report said.
 The I.M.F. predicted that the advanced countries would grow by 2.4 percent in 2011, down from its October estimate of 2.5 percent growth.
 It said that underlying inflation would probably remain low for some time, allowing central banks to maintain low interest rates.

HEADLINE: Bid to Take Over St. Vincent's Spurs Outcry on Critical Care

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS; Paul Vitello contributed reporting.

 BODY:
One of New York City's largest hospital systems has made an offer to take over the financially struggling St. Vincent's Hospital in Greenwich Village, provoking opposition from elected officials who fear the loss of critical medical services, especially emergency care, for tens of thousands of patients who could be sent elsewhere.
 The proposal by the hospital system, Continuum Health Partners, to take over St. Vincent's and turn it into an outpatient center would mean the loss of the city's last Catholic general hospital, at least in the form in which it has been known for more than 160 years.
 St. Vincent's treats a disproportionate number of poor, homeless and uninsured patients, who could be forced to go elsewhere for emergency and inpatient care, perhaps to the city-run Bellevue Hospital Center across town. St. Vincent's acquired significance for many New Yorkers in the days after Sept. 11, 2001, when it became a gathering place for people searching for loved ones. 
 It has been looking for a financial lifesaver to help it stem millions of dollars a month in losses and to stave off the possibility of a second bankruptcy after emerging from its first in 2007. The Continuum proposal would turn the hospital into a walk-in health-care center that would maintain some emergency services but would no longer take 911 ambulance calls, the most serious cases. It also envisions maintaining St. Vincent's well-known H.I.V. and psychiatric services.
 If the deal goes through, Continuum could get tens of thousands of new patients. Depending on how the deal is structured, Continuum could take over St. Vincent's valuable real estate, which could potentially be sold. There would be no exchange of money; Continuum would take on the hospital's debt, said to be around $700 million, and try to restructure it with financial support from the state and creditors.
 The proposal would not include other St. Vincent's facilities around the metropolitan area, or its nursing homes and its psychiatric and substance abuse hospital in Westchester County.
 A decision to sell is up to the board of St. Vincent's, but the hospital is under pressure from creditors and the state to find a solution to its problems. Henry J. Amoroso, the president and chief executive of St. Vincent's, sent a one-page memorandum to hospital physicians and staff members Tuesday confirming that the hospital had received a letter of interest from Continuum. Mr. Amoroso said he was writing in response to a report in The New York Post on Tuesday outlining some aspects of the proposal.
 Mr. Amoroso said the hospital was in ''serious discussion'' with GE Capital and TD Bank, which hold some of its debt, ''about how best to restructure the burdensome debt that we were left with when we emerged from bankruptcy.''
 He said the hospital's board was still trying to find ''the best solution to allow St. Vincent's to remain an acute-care hospital.''
 Community reaction was strong. A united front of West Side politicians, including Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker; Scott M. Stringer, the Manhattan borough president; and Representative Jerrold L. Nadler, sent a letter to Dr. Richard F. Daines, the state health commissioner, saying that the proposed conversion was ''unacceptable.''
 They pointed out that it would leave much of the West Side without a hospital. Likely destinations for patients of St. Vincent's, which has several buildings clustered around Avenue of the Americas, Seventh Avenue and 11th and 12th Streets, are St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, with components on West 59th and West 114th Streets, and Beth Israel Medical Center, on First Avenue and 16th Street, both owned by Continuum. Others are Bellevue, a few blocks north of Beth Israel, and New York Downtown Hospital, near the Brooklyn Bridge.
 Ms. Quinn suggested that a state-sponsored bailout or restructuring might be in order. ''No one's cavalier about the seriousness of St. Vincent's financial house,'' she said in an interview. ''But what we need is to come together and find a solution that keeps it open, not one that basically abdicates the state's responsibility to have full-service health care infrastructure for the West Side of Manhattan.''
 In a statement, Continuum said that it had been invited by St. Vincent's to make a proposal to preserve the hospital in some form as ''an alternative to financial liquidation.''
 It added that if St. Vincent's rejected the proposal and tried to continue on its own, ''they have our full support.''
 The State Health Department also issued a statement Tuesday painting a dire picture of St. Vincent's financial condition and saying that Dr. Daines had been trying to help broker a deal that would ''ensure that residents of the West Side of Manhattan continue to have access to quality health care services.''
 But the department said that St. Vincent's ''is not competitive within its market.'' The hospital has been losing $5 million to $10 million a month, according to the state.
 Hospitals across the city have suffered from what they say are low reimbursement rates from the government and private insurers; large numbers of poor patients; and, more recently, the recession, coupled with state health-care cuts. 
 In what some health-care officials characterized as a last-ditch effort, St. Vincent's has been hoping to stay in business by building a new hospital, which would free up a large part of its property to be sold for about $310 million to the Rudin Organization, which would develop housing.
 The plans would require significant rezoning. Continuum's proposal casts doubt on the future of those development plans, said Andrew Berman, executive director of the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation.
 Ana Marengo, a spokeswoman for the city's Health and Hospital Corporation, said that Bellevue officials believed they would be able to handle their share of emergency and trauma patients from St. Vincent's. She said Bellevue would have a harder time absorbing psychiatric patients, but Continuum's proposal would keep psychiatric services running at the St. Vincent's location.
 Archbishop Timothy M. Dolan of New York said in a statement that it would be ''sad and disappointing'' if St. Vincent's closed. Although the archdiocese does not have a role in the hospital, it said it was monitoring the situation and recognized how hard it was to run a hospital. 
 The hospital is sponsored by the Sisters of Charity, the Catholic order that founded the hospital in 1849, and the Diocese of Brooklyn, a consequence of a merger with Catholic hospitals in Brooklyn and Queens more than a decade ago. If the hospital were sold, the bishop of Brooklyn and the Sisters of Charity would have to decide whether to ratify the decision, said Msgr. Kieran Harrington, a spokesman for Bishop Nicholas A. DiMarzio. Monsignor Harrington said it ''would be premature to comment now'' on what the bishop planned to do.

HEADLINE: Toyota Halting Most Car Sales For Pedal Flaw

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY; Keith Bradsher, Julie Creswell and Micheline Maynard contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Toyota Motor, still struggling to resolve a problem with accelerator pedals, said Tuesday that it would temporarily stop building and selling eight models, including the popular Camry and Corolla sedans, in the North American market.
 The unusual move follows two recalls of millions of vehicles in the last two months for a problem that the company has described as a ''rare'' condition in which the gas pedal can stick and cause a vehicle to speed up unintentionally.
 ''This action is necessary until a remedy is finalized,'' Robert S. Carter, a Toyota group vice president, said in a statement. ''We're making every effort to address this situation for our customers as quickly as possible.'' 
 The suspension has the potential to further damage Toyota, whose reputation for quality helped make it the world's No. 1 carmaker in recent years. Toyota said it would immediately stop selling the Camry, Corolla and Avalon sedans, Matrix wagon, RAV4 crossover, Tundra pickup, and Highlander and Sequoia sport utility vehicles. 
 Toyota said the move was intended to restore confidence in the automaker, and the safety of its products. One analyst said many consumers might have a different reaction.
 ''The problem seems to be getting larger than anyone was led to believe at first,'' said Erich Merkle, an analyst with Autoconomy.com in Grand Rapids, Mich. ''A lot of those vehicles are probably in the garages of families. It gets people thinking, 'Would I want my wife and kids in the vehicle, would they know what to do in a situation like that.' ''
 It will also stop building those models the week of Feb. 1. All of the vehicles are assembled in the United States or Canada, at a total of five plants.
 The models affected accounted for more than a million sales in 2009, 57 percent of Toyota's American total for the year. 
 Stock in Toyota was down 3.4 percent at midday on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
 Toyota's acknowledgement of problems with acceleration pedals reawakens one of the oldest safety issues in the auto industry. Manufacturers have long dismissed that a vehicle can race forward out of the driver's control, contending that the problem takes place when a driver mistakenly pushes the accelerator while trying to hit the brake pedal. 
 Design changes to address sudden acceleration have focused until now on placing the accelerator pedal farther to the right relative to the steering wheel, so that drivers are less likely to depress it by mistake during an emergency.
 The recession has led to a sharp drop in sales over all for the auto industry. For Toyota dealers, the news will likely further reduce their business. 
 ''It's not exciting to hear that a good portion of my inventory now can't be sold,'' said Paul Lunsford, general manager of South Coast Toyota in Costa Mesa, Calif. 
 But Mr. Lunsford, who has been a Toyota dealer for 30 years, applauded the company's decision to move fast to suspend sales of the vehicles involved in last week's recall. ''Nobody had to put a gun to Toyota's head to get them to do the right thing,'' he said.
 Still, Mr. Lunsford added, ''it's not the feel-good story of the year if you're a Toyota dealer.''
 A November recall by Toyota was intended to fix a design flaw that could cause the gas pedal to become trapped under the floor mat. It was prompted in part by the crash of a Lexus sedan that ran out of control and crashed into a ravine near San Diego, killing four people.
 But the automaker and federal safety officials continued to receive reports of unintended acceleration and stuck pedals even in cases where the floor mats had been removed, a stopgap measure recommended by Toyota.
 The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has been looking into two recent episodes, in Texas and in New Jersey. Four people died on Dec. 26 near Dallas when a Toyota Avalon -- with its floor mats in the trunk -- went off a road and landed upside down in a pond.
 In announcing a second recall last week, Toyota said the accelerator pedal could wear down and become difficult to depress, slow to spring back or get stuck partly depressed.
 Toyota does not have a solution for the problem yet, and it said drivers who experienced it should depress the brake firmly and steadily, and then contact a dealer after the vehicle was in a safe location and turned off. 
 Drivers who have not had a problem should wait for the company to develop a remedy before visiting their dealer.
 Together, the two recalls cover 4.8 million vehicles, including 1.7 million affected by both. The Prius hybrid and several Lexus models were included in the November recall but not in last week's action or the sales halt.
 The latest series of recalls threaten to undo all the efforts Toyota made in the middle of the last decade, when it was hit by a series of quality problems that caused recalls to spike. But a number of those recalls were for vehicles at least a decade old. 
 On its Web site, Toyota said the years and models affected in the sales suspension were the 2009-2010 RAV4 crossover, the 2009-2010 Corolla, the 2009-2010 Matrix, the 2005-2010 Avalon, the 2007-2010 Camry, the 2010 Highlander, the 2007-2010 Tundra, and the 2008-2010 Sequoia.
 The plants affected are in Canada, Kentucky and Texas, with two in Indiana.
 The most recent recalls follow what Toyota insisted was a companywide effort to improve quality that was started by Katsuaki Watanabe, who served as its president before he was replaced last year by Akio Toyoda, grandson of the company's founder.
 The decision to stop production, though unusual, is not unprecedented. Detroit carmakers have delayed or slowed production to address quality issues.
 The decision by Toyota on Tuesday has parallels to Ford's response to Firestone tire problems in 2000 and 2001, but Toyota's action is much more wide-ranging.
 Ford did not halt sales of its Explorer sport utility vehicles when it recalled them in 2000 and 2001 for the replacement of Firestone tires. 
 The company did announce the suspension of production for one week in 2001 because Firestone had not yet made enough tires using a new design and manufacturing process to supply tires for both the recall and for new vehicles.

HEADLINE: Koreas Exchange Fire at Sea, Adding to Tension

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea 

 BODY:
North Korea fired dozens of artillery shells on Wednesday from its shoreline into waters near its disputed western sea border with South Korea, and the South Korean military returned warning shots from smaller weapons, according to South Korean military officials and fishermen on a border island. 
 After the morning barrage, South Korea issued three warning broadcasts and then its marines based on a border island unleashed about 100 warning shots with their antiaircraft guns. 
 Neither side reported casualties or damage. The North Korean military warned in a statement that more shells would be on their way as part of a winter training exercise, highlighting instability in the western waters, the most volatile segment of the Koreas' border. 
 On Wednesday morning, about 30 rounds of North Korean artillery splashed into two spots just north of the so-called Northern Limit Line, a United Nations-drawn sea border accepted by the South but disputed by the North, said a spokesman at the Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Seoul, who spoke on condition of anonymity until the government made a formal announcement. 
 Hours later, North Korea fired a new barrage involving ''tens of shells,'' the official said.
 The rising tension at sea comes amid recent signals from Pyongyang that it was ready to return six-nation talks on ending its nuclear weapons program. In return for resuming the talks, North Korea has demanded talks on a peace treaty with the United States to formally end the 1950-3 Korean War and the lifting of United Nations sanctions tightened after its two nuclear tests. 
 When North Korea wants to highlight instability along the frontier and thus the need for a permanent peace treaty, it often reasserts its territorial claims and warns of military clashes on the western sea.
 The exchange of fire startled residents of Baengnyeong, the border island. 
 ''We panicked a little because it was so loud and more fierce than their usual training,'' said Kim Oe-sun, a shop owner on Baengnyeong Island, referring to the firing from the marine brigade stationed there. 
 Oh Baek-kyun, another Baengnyeong resident, said in a telephone interview: ''It's life as usual here. But a cargo ship bound for our island turned around because of what had happened out on the sea.'' 
 On Tuesday, North Korea declared two no-sail zones straddling the disputed sea border. It usually designates such zones when its military conducts missile or artillery drills. 
 But the locations of the latest firing zones raised fears that North Korea might fire shells into South Korean-controlled waters to enforce a territorial claim, draw the South into dialogue and win economic concessions. In the past week, the two Koreas have engaged in harsh exchanges, with the North threatening a ''holy war to blow away'' the Seoul government and the South warning that it would launch pre-emptive military strikes if it saw clear signs of an imminent nuclear attack from the North. 
 The incident on Wednesday came after patrol ships from the two Koreas exchanged fire in the area in November. One North Korean sailor was believed to have been killed and three others wounded in that fighting, according to the South, which did not suffer casualties. The two navies also fought bloody skirmishes in the disputed waters in 1999 and 2002. 
 In a message to the North, South Korea expressed ''grave concern,'' accusing the North Korean military of ''creating unnecessary tension through live-shell artillery fire.'' 
 But the North Korean military said, ''No one can argue about our premeditated exercises.'' Its statement was carried by the North's state-run news agency, K.C.N.A. 
 South Korea said ferry services were not interrupted to South Korean islands that lied within the range of North Korean shore guns, whose shells can travel up to 17 miles. 
 Baengnyeong Island lies 10 miles from the North Korean shore. South Korean marines maintain their barracks behind hills facing the North as a precaution against any attack. Civilians, most of them fishermen, are trained to run for military bunkers and pick up arms if a North Korean attack begins.

 BODY:
In and of themselves, the economic initiatives announced this week by the Obama administration are not objectionable. 
 One is a modest package of tax credits and other subsidies intended to help middle-class Americans with some big expenses, like day care, student-loan payments and retirement savings. The other, intended to signal President Obama's willingness to cut the budget deficit, calls for a three-year spending freeze in many discretionary domestic programs, and for increases no greater than inflation after that. The freeze would apply to lower priority programs in a sliver of the overall budget, while spending on administration priorities -- like education and environment -- would continue to grow.
 The freeze would have a relatively small effect on spending -- about $10 billion less in 2011 out of about $500 billion in programs. It would be foolish to cut any more deeply when the economy is still so troubled. The real value of the freeze would lie in Mr. Obama's ability to use it politically -- say by trading this deficit reduction for lawmakers' votes on a jobs bill this year. 
 The problem with the initiatives is that even if they work as planned, Americans need much more. They need leadership that is more inspired and an agenda that is bigger and more detailed than these ideas. The country desperately needs bold moves, starting with the State of the Union address Wednesday night.
 The Obama administration has done some important things. Without last year's stimulus package, the economy would be in a far weaker state. Health care reform would be good for the economy and the budget, if it can be saved. 
 But there's a crater in the economy where the job market used to be, a hole so deep that it would take at least 10 million new jobs to fill it. There are more than six jobless workers for every job opening, which means prolonged spells of unemployment for many of the nation's 15.3 million jobless workers. 
 A lack of jobs also means delays in getting hired or lower entry-level wages for millions of high school and college graduates -- long-lasting setbacks. It portends little to no wage gains well into the future for millions of underemployed Americans, and even for the majority who have held on to their jobs as the economy has tanked. It means intractable budget deficits -- because without new jobs, economic performance and tax revenues will remain inadequate. 
 Mr. Obama owes the country an unflinching assessment of the dire job situation and a plan for fixing it that starts with a commitment to lead the effort himself. If he leaves it up to Congress, lawmakers are unlikely to deliver. Even the $154 billion jobs bill passed by the House in December is only a starting point for the repair and recovery work that needs to be done. 
 To create jobs, Mr. Obama must make it clear that he will not abandon the states at this time of budget crises. Bolstered aid to states is unpopular. But it is among the surest ways to preserve and create jobs because the money is pushed through quickly to employees, contractors and beneficiaries. The alternative is recovery-killing spending cuts and tax increases on the state level. 
 Mr. Obama also must champion increased small business lending and direct creation of both skilled and low-skilled jobs. He must embrace ways to pay for initiatives, such as redeploying money from the bank bailout or endorsing a financial-transactions tax on Wall Street.
 The danger is that the initiatives announced so far this week will move to center stage, eclipsing more difficult and more important needs. It is Mr. Obama's job to make sure that does not happen.

HEADLINE: Adults Only, Please

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
Maybe it's just me, but I've found the last few weeks in American politics particularly unnerving. Our economy is still very fragile, yet you would never know that by the way the political class is acting. We're like a patient that just got out of intensive care and is sitting up in bed for the first time when, suddenly, all the doctors and nurses at bedside start bickering. One of them throws a stethoscope across the room; someone else threatens to unplug all the monitors unless the hospital bills are paid by noon; and all the while the patient is thinking: ''Are you people crazy? I am just starting to recover. Do you realize how easily I could relapse? Aren't there any adults here?''
 Sometimes you wonder: Are we home alone? Obviously, the political and financial elites to whom we give authority often act on the basis of personal interests. But we still have a long way to go to get out of the mess we are in, and if our elites do not behave with a greater sense of the common good we could find our economy doing a double dip with a back flip. 
 Dov Seidman, the C.E.O. of LRN, which helps companies build ethical cultures, likes to talk about two kinds of values: ''situational values'' and ''sustainable values.'' Leaders, companies or individuals guided by situational values do whatever the situation will allow, no matter the wider interests of their communities. A banker who writes a mortgage for someone he knows can't make the payments over time is acting on situational values, saying: ''I'll be gone when the bill comes due.'' 
 People inspired by sustainable values act just the opposite, saying: ''I will never be gone. I will always be here. Therefore, I must behave in ways that sustain -- my employees, my customers, my suppliers, my environment, my country and my future generations.''
 Lately, we've seen an explosion of situational thinking. I support the broad proposals President Obama put forth last week to prevent banks from becoming too big to fail and to protect taxpayers from banks that get in trouble by speculating and then expect us to bail them out. But the way the president unveiled his proposals -- ''if those folks want a fight, it's a fight I'm ready to have'' -- left me feeling as though he was looking for a way to bash the banks right after the Democrats' loss in Massachusetts, in order to score a few cheap political points more than to initiate a serious national discussion about an incredibly complex issue.
 President Obama is so much better when he takes a heated, knotty issue, like civil rights or banking reform, and talks to the country like adults. He is so much better at making us smarter than angrier. Going to war with the banks for a quick political sugar high after an electoral loss will just work against him and us. It will spook the banks into lending even less and slow the recovery even more. 
 That said, part of me can't blame the president. The behavior of some leading Wall Street banks, particularly Goldman Sachs, has been utterly selfish. U.S. taxpayers saved Goldman by saving one of its big counterparties, A.I.G. By any fair calculation, the U.S. Treasury should own a slice of Goldman today. Goldman has been the poster boy for banks behaving by ''situational values'' -- exploiting whatever the situation, or rules that it helped to write, allowed. 
 Also, President Obama tried to create a bipartisan commission to come up with a plan to reduce the national debt -- a plan that would inflict pain on both parties by cutting some programs and raising some taxes. But the Republican leader, Senator Mitch McConnell, said the G.O.P. would not cooperate with any commission that proposes raising taxes. And some liberal Democrats rejected cutting their favorite programs. Way to take one for the country, guys. 
 Then let's look at the unions -- hardly paragons of sustainable thinking for the country. We all know they got more than their fair share in the General Motors settlement and in the Obama health care proposals because they could shake down the Democrats in return for votes. 
 And, finally, don't forget both the Democratic and Republican senators who have decided to get a quick populist boost by turning one of the few adults we have left -- Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke -- into a pinata. No, Mr. Bernanke is not blameless for the 2008 crisis. But since then he has helped steer the country back from the brink and kept us out of a depression. He absolutely deserves reappointment.
 No doubt, this is a lousy season to be the leader of any institution. We are in the midst of a long period of austerity, where all that most leaders will be able to do is cut, fire and trim. It is so easy to play populism and run against them. But this time is different. When our government is this deeply involved in propping up our economy, and the economy is this fragile, politics as usual will kill us. We badly need leaders inspired by sustainable values, not situational ones. Without that, we'll just be digging our hole deeper and making the reckoning, when it comes, that much more ferocious.

HEADLINE: In Britain, A Call to Split Big Banks

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
Mervyn A. King, the governor of the Bank of England, is an owlish, self-effacing man who, in contrast to his more outspoken peers in Frankfurt and Washington, strikes a public posture that borders on the demure.
 But as outrage over lush banking profits gathers steam on both sides of the Atlantic, Mr. King finds himself at the vanguard of a growing movement that argues that big banks must separate their higher-risk trading and investment banking businesses from their core deposit-taking functions.
 Last week, such a proposal pushed by the former Federal Reserve chairman Paul A. Volcker made headway. President Obama shocked Wall Street by proposing that large banks that collect customer deposits be banned from engaging in proprietary trading activities. 
 At a hearing before a parliamentary treasury committee on Tuesday, Mr. King used some of his strongest language yet to support such a separation. In the process, he hailed Mr. Obama for having moved so quickly.
 ''The U.S. has been more open in moving to a safer banking system than we are,'' he said. ''After you ring-fence retail deposits, the statement that no one else gets bailed out becomes credible.''
 To illustrate his point that increased regulation and higher capital requirements alone would not be sufficient to forestall another banking crisis, he pointed to Citigroup -- which once was seen as a model for combining all banking functions under one roof.
 ''You had regulators in the building and four of the most respected people in the world running the bank,'' he said, citing its architect, Sanford I. Weill; the former Treasury secretary Robert E. Rubin; the former International Monetary Fund official Stanley Fischer; and a veteran international banker, William Rhodes.
 ''They did not set out to destroy Citibank, but when you have a large complicated institution, things happen,'' he said. ''That is the argument for trying to create firewalls.''
 Under post-Depression laws, bank holding companies in the United States were not allowed to own investment banks before 1999. But in Europe, no such division ever existed.
 In fact, until last week such a notion had been roundly criticized, more a provocative debating point in an academic seminar than a practicable piece of legislation. Others speculated that the idea would surely be swatted away by muscular banking lobbies if it ever came close to becoming law.
 Indeed, some see the idea, far-fetched and steeped in principle as it may be, as more an emblem of Mr. King's own unyielding sense of what is right and what is wrong for the markets -- albeit one that in this case is in tune with the public mood.
 ''I think Mervyn is a little more fixated on moral hazard than others,'' said DeAnne Julius, a prominent economist here, referring to the view that rescuing banks via bailouts or sharp cuts in interest rates just encourages more of the risky conduct that got them in trouble in the first place.
 Ms. Julius, a former member of the central bank's policy-making committee, disagrees with Mr. King's bank proposal. But she acknowledged that ''he believes strongly in the rigors of market discipline, and he has a tendency to stay with a theory and get the world to conform to it.''
 Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who earlier fired his own cannonball at bankers with his proposal for 50 percent tax on bonuses, said on Tuesday that British banks were not in need of such a change. 
 Last month Robert Diamond Jr., the president of Barclays, which with its substantial trading business would be one of the banks most affected, gave a series of speeches defending the universal model.
 ''Banks are bound to fight,'' Mr. King said in his testimony. 
 Mr. King's arguments were delivered with a severity that reached beyond his view that banks that had become larger and more profitable since the crisis must be shrunk.
 A former finance professor at the London School of Economics, Mr. King, 61, is known as a ferocious worker.
 And in 2007, as central banks in the United States and Europe aggressively cut interest rates, Mr. King stubbornly kept British rates fixed, arguing that any such loosening would unfairly reward bad banking behavior.
 After the failure of Northern Rock and the collapse of Lehman Brothers, Mr. King shifted course. The Bank of England has become perhaps the most aggressive central bank in terms of adding liquidity to the economy by buying government bonds.
 But after this unprecedented action, Mr. King has become even more doctrinaire in his view that the large banks that have benefited be forced to pay a price, one that would ensure that they never again threaten the viability of the world financial system.
 In his testimony, Mr. King said he had been thinking about how to address the dangers of big banking since 2007, at the first signs of the crisis.
 But it was not until last June, during a speech before the financial industry, that he first suggested that only through such a breakup could bankers reclaim public trust.
 '' 'My word is my bond' are old words,'' he said dryly as London's banking elite tucked into their filet mignon dinners. '' 'My word is my C.D.O.-squared' will never catch on,'' he added, using the abbreviation for collateralized debt obligation, one of the financial instruments that were blamed for precipitating the financial crisis.
 Since that speech, Mr. King has become a cult hero of sorts to many academics and others who advocate even harsher measures to keep banks on the straight and narrow.
 One who has had his ear is Laurence J. Kotlikoff, a professor at Boston University who wants all financial institutions -- from hedge funds to private equity funds as well as investment and commercial banks -- to reconstitute themselves as mutual funds, meaning they would not be allowed to borrow to increase the size of their investments. The goal would be to prevent the types of debt-fueled bets that had such dire consequences.
 That Mr. King would just about endorse such a proposal for the entire financial industry -- he referred to Mr. Kotlikoff twice in his testimony on Tuesday -- suggests that he may be inclined to push further than Mr. Obama.
 ''He is interested in this idea,'' said Mr. Kotlikoff, who presented his idea to Bank of England officials last November and says he will do so again next month. ''And he understands the depth of the problem.''

HEADLINE: Obama, on Own, To Set Up Panel On Nation's Debt

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES; David M. Herszenhorn contributed reporting from Washington.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Advocates of more aggressive steps to address the national debt failed Tuesday in their effort to create a bipartisan commission to press for tax increases and spending cuts, but President Obama now plans to establish a similar panel by executive order in his State of the Union address on Wednesday.
 The proposal for a commission died when its supporters could not muster enough votes in the Senate to push it ahead, reflecting unwillingness among many Republicans to back any move toward tax increases and objections among Democrats to the prospect of deep spending cuts in Medicare and Medicaid. While 53 senators voted for the plan and 46 against, it needed 60 votes to be approved under Senate rules. 
 The alternative panel to be established by Mr. Obama will also come up with recommendations by December to reduce annual budget deficits and slow or reverse the growth of the national debt. But unlike the commission proposal killed by the Senate, Mr. Obama's executive order could not force Congress to vote on a commission's suggestions. 
 The debate was just the latest demonstration of the intensity of the election-year fight shaping up over the nation's rising debt and its causes and solutions.
 The issue will be a major theme of Mr. Obama's nationally televised speech Wednesday night, as he seeks to respond to the public's concern about the budget deficit. 
 But his responses so far, including the debt commission and a proposed three-year freeze on domestic programs, drew howls of anger on Tuesday from his party's left, which objected to his exempting defense spending while putting Medicare and Medicaid on the chopping block. At the same time, he earned mainly derision from Republicans. 
 Just before senators voted, the Congressional Budget Office released a report projecting that the deficit for this fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, would be $1.3 trillion. That is a slight improvement over last year's shortfall, because of early, fragile signs of economic growth, and it would be a return to the annual level projected when President George W. Bush left office.
 But the long-term budget outlook, according to the office, is persistent high deficits that will accumulate to drive the debt ever upward, to the point that it could nearly equal the value of the nation's entire economic output by 2020.
 With hiring lagging behind the recovery that began in the second half of last year, the budget office forecast that the unemployment rate would remain at 10 percent through this year. That will keep Democrats on the defensive in a Congressional election year. But even by 2012, when Mr. Obama faces re-election, the jobless rate would be just below 9 percent, the budget office projected.
 A $1.3 trillion deficit for this fiscal year would equal about 9.2 percent of gross domestic product. Last year's $1.4 trillion deficit was nearly 10 percent of gross domestic product, making it the largest since World War II measured against the size of the economy.
 But the budget office said that additional stimulus spending and tax cuts, which the White House and Congress currently are considering for families, small businesses, the unemployed and hard-hit states, could well result in a deficit for this year that exceeds last year's. At the same time, it said, the stimulus measures to date have ''helped moderate the severity of the recession and shorten its duration.'' 
 The annual report, together with Mr. Obama's budget, to be released on Monday, gives lawmakers the fiscal and economic data they need to begin a new year of budget-writing. 
 As they do, both Congress and the White House confront conflicting pressures from voters and markets to take steps that will reduce deficits in the long run but add to them in the short run, by extending the existing stimulus spending and tax cuts, to prop up the economy so does not fall back into a recession.
 ''That is a tension that policymakers will need to wrestle with,'' Douglas W. Elmendorf, director of the budget office, told reporters.
 Another downturn, most economists argue, would inflate deficits even further by forcing more spending for relief programs for the unemployed and by reducing tax collections from individuals and businesses. 
 Yet the public's belief that spending is out of control is undercutting Mr. Obama's support, polls show. And a debt of the size projected would threaten future prosperity and raise the interest rates the nation must pay for its borrowing, as foreign investors demand higher returns to reflect their risks.
 As it stands, low interest rates are holding down the size of deficits, as the budget office said. But an increase in interest rates, which many people consider inevitable, would add to federal costs for interest payments on the publicly held debt. Interest on the debt already is one of the largest items in the budget, along with spending for defense and entitlement programs.
 According to the budget office, interest payments will more than triple in dollar terms over the decade, to $723 billion in 2020 from a projected $207 billion this year. The deficit issue has risen to a public prominence not seen in two decades, reflecting the size of the debt, now exceeding $12 trillion; the dire future projections as health costs rise and the population ages, boosting Medicare and Medicaid spending to unsustainable levels; and the intensity of Mr. Obama's opposition on the right.
 The vote on a commission proposal was the price that fiscally conservative senators extracted from Congressional Democratic leaders as the price for their support later this week in a vote to increase the $12 trillion debt limit. Without an increase, the government soon could not borrow to cover its obligations.
 The proposal, co-sponsored by Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota, the chairman of the Budget Committee, and Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, the committee's senior Republican, called for an 18-member commission -- eight lawmakers from each party and two administration officials -- to draft a package that Congress would have to vote on in December without amending it. 
 One of the most vocal opponents was Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. He said the bill's sponsors had ''painted a big red bull's-eye on Social Security,'' adding, ''Their commission is a Social Security-cutting machine.''
 After the vote, Mr. Conrad said he was ''delighted'' to have gotten 53 votes, adding, ''I think that provides a significant boost to the momentum that is under way to begin to address the very deep challenge of a burgeoning debt.''
 But Mr. Gregg, in a statement, said the outcome was ''yet another indication that Congress is more concerned with the next election than the next generation.''
 In an interview, however, Mr. Gregg would not commit to supporting a presidential commission. ''It would still have no force of law to bind the Congress to do anything, and there really aren't a whole lot of giants around here,'' he said.
 Other Congressional Republican leaders have openly indicated they would refuse to serve on a commission, especially one that Mr. Obama creates. They say that Democrats are trying to avoid spending cuts before the election.
 But some Democrats say the Republicans will have a hard time justifying their refusal should Mr. Obama invite them to the negotiating table, considering that much of the nation's debt is the result of spending and tax cuts during the years up to 2007 when Republicans controlled both the White House and Congress.

HEADLINE: Dalai Lama's Envoys to Resume Talks With China

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG; Xiyun Yang contributed research.

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
Envoys of the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of the Tibetans, arrived in China on Tuesday to resume a long-running series of negotiations over Tibet that have so far been fruitless.
 The current set of negotiations will be the ninth since 2002 between the Dalai Lama, whom China accuses of being a dangerous ''splittist,'' and the Chinese government, which has flooded large areas of Tibetan regions in western China with security forces since a widespread uprising there in March 2008.
 The Dalai Lama, 74, who lives in exile in the Indian hill town of Dharamsala, says he does not want independence for Tibetan regions, but rather greater autonomy -- the Tibetans should be able to make their own policy regarding religious practice, education and immigration to the regions, he says. Tibetans are anxious over the large numbers of ethnic Han, who dominate most of China, moving to the Tibetan plateau to seek their fortunes. 
 The series of negotiations between the Dalai Lama and China broke down in November 2008, after Chinese officials strongly rejected a proposal for genuine autonomy presented to them. During the eighth round of talks, the two envoys who handed over that proposal were Lodi G. Gyari, from Washington, and Kelsang Gyaltsen, of Switzerland. Both are representing the Dalai Lama again in this round.
 The envoys will return to India in early February, the Tibetan government-in-exile said in a statement on its Web site.
 The United Front Work Department, the part of the Chinese Communist Party that officially deals with ethnic policy, said in a written statement on Tuesday: ''We hope the Dalai Lama side will cherish this opportunity and eagerly respond to the demands by the central government.''
 Tibet remains one of the most delicate issues between China and the United States. President Obama has said he will meet with the Dalai Lama early this year. Last fall, Mr. Obama declined to meet with the Dalai Lama while the Dalai Lama was visiting the United States. The move was widely seen as an attempt by Mr. Obama to improve United States-China relations, but Chinese leaders continued to press the president on Tibet during his first state visit to China in November. State Department officials quickly abandoned a new phrase that had been coined to describe the conciliatory approach -- ''strategic reassurance'' -- and which had been criticized by some Americans as being tantamount to appeasement.
 Late Monday, the State Department said it welcomed the latest round of negotiations between the Dalai Lama and China.
 ''The United States strongly supports dialogue between China and the Dalai Lama's representatives to address longstanding differences,'' said Philip Crowley, a State Department spokesman, in a written statement. ''The administration hopes this meeting will produce positive results and provide a foundation for future discussions to resolve outstanding issues.''
 Though Tibetans uniformly revere the Dalai Lama, there are many, especially younger ones, who criticize the Dalai Lama's approach to China. They say that the Tibetan exile movement should be seeking independence for Tibet, not accommodation under Chinese rule. The Chinese government has no intention of giving ground, they say, and is just using the series of negotiations to stall for time until the Dalai Lama dies.
 ''Until we see visible change on the ground in Tibet and some real give-and-take on the part of the Chinese government, we can be confident that the resumption of the dialogue is nothing more than a delaying tactic designed to mute international criticism, especially in the lead up to the expected meeting between Obama and the Dalai Lama,'' said Tenzin Dorjee, executive director of Students for a Free Tibet, a group based in New York that advocates for Tibetan independence.
 The Dalai Lama's spokesman, Tenzin Taklha, said Monday that the talks were part of an ''important process of trying to find a mutually agreed solution,'' according to Agence France-Presse.
 Last week, China's top leaders met to draw up plans for governing Tibet. State news organizations said the leaders determined that continued economic development would bring ''stability'' to the region.

HEADLINE: With Sun, Oracle Aims At Giants

BYLINE: By ASHLEE VANCE

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
Oracle, having spent the last nine months fighting rivals and regulators in order to own Sun Microsystems, has pushed itself into the middle of the scrum of technology heavyweights all jostling for the same corporate customers. 
 The $7.4 billion deal, which gives Oracle a vast hardware business for the first time, pits it against Hewlett-Packard, I.B.M., Dell and Cisco Systems, all of which have made a flurry of acquisitions and alliances. Many of these moves broadened the companies' products and services from their traditional specialties, like databases, computers or networking equipment. Each company wants to be able to claim to prospective customers that it, and it alone, has more of the parts to be an end-to-end service provider.
 ''The cost isn't in buying the pieces,'' Lawrence J. Ellison, the chief executive of Oracle, said in a phone interview on Tuesday. ''The cost is in the labor of assembling them and making them work.''
 On Wednesday, Oracle will hold an event at its Silicon Valley headquarters where executives from the company will talk in detail about the plans for Sun Microsystems. 
 Mr. Ellison said that in the next few months, Oracle planned to lay off fewer than 2,000 people, while hiring more than 2,000 people in engineering, sales and other roles. He did not rule out that additional layoffs might occur later.
 Mr. Ellison added that he expected Sun's chief executive, Jonathan I. Schwartz, to resign and that he hoped that Scott G. McNealy, Sun's co-founder and chairman, would stay on at Oracle, although his title and duties were not clear.
 ''We need to have more conversations about his role,'' Mr. Ellison said.
 Oracle's purchase of Sun, which European regulators approved last week after months of scrutiny, stands out as the most game-changing corporate technology play made during the economic downturn, according to industry analysts.
 ''It's the most significant deal of the decade,'' said Dan Olds, an analyst with Gabriel Consulting. ''Oracle has a shot here to change the rules of the industry and usher in a new era.''
 As analysts like Mr. Olds point out, the era is new only in relative terms.
 The corporate computing market began decades ago with I.B.M. selling customers systems that included most of the hardware and software they would need in a single package. As time went on, a host of minicomputer makers rose to prominence with a similar strategy, in which they would build all of the crucial pieces of a large system, including its chips, main software and networking technology.
 The older model of selling corporate systems was then disrupted by the rise of powerful, more standardized computers based on readily available chips from Intel and an innovative software market. Customers could suddenly choose the technology they preferred from a variety of suppliers and assemble those products in their own data centers.
 Prices of hardware and software declined under this competitive pressure.
 Oracle, for one, wants to revert to the more traditional model.
 The company plans to offer customers databases, business software, servers, storage systems and networking equipment from one place. In addition, Oracle will do the hard engineering work to make sure all this technology works well together, Mr. Ellison said.
 ''It is odd that the computer industry ships all these separate parts and expects customers to assemble them,'' Mr. Ellison said. ''You will now be buying this complete system, and don't have to hire I.B.M. or someone else to assemble it for you.''
 While Oracle has long battled I.B.M. in the database market, its push into computer hardware places the company in direct competition with longtime partners like H.P. and Dell.
 Last year, Cisco Systems branched out from its roots as the world's largest networking company and began selling computer servers -- a move that pitted it against H.P., Dell and I.B.M. Cisco also formed a sales partnership with EMC and its software subsidiary VMware that further fanned competition. Traditionally, Cisco had teamed with H.P., Dell and I.B.M. in large data center deals. 
 H.P. has countered Cisco by investing more in its existing networking products and acquiring the networking company 3Com for $2.7 billion last November. In addition, H.P. bought the services giant Electronic Data Systems in 2008 for $13.9 billion in a bid to bolster the company's ability to sell more equipment and services to customers often served by I.B.M.
 This month, H.P. and Microsoft revealed an alliance as well in which the companies plan to create tighter links between their respective products. Analysts have viewed this move as a stab at Oracle, which competes against Microsoft in the database market.
 ''It's sort of funny because the companies themselves are getting more integrated,'' said Gordon Haff, a technology analyst with Illuminata. ''And now they're trying put together as many products as they can for customers to buy.''
 The reaction of large customers to these sweeping deals has been mixed. On one hand, customers see the benefits in buying equipment that works smoothly from one place. But they are concerned that a lack of competition will result in higher prices if one company has too much control.
 ''To not have to deal with a bunch of suppliers in the room is certainly worth quite a premium,'' said Don Lemma, the chief information officer at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in Silicon Valley. ''Still, there are getting to be fewer and fewer options out there.''
 According to Mr. Lemma, Oracle's acquisition of a hardware business should make things much tougher on H.P. and Dell. Thanks to its database software, which is used by most of the world's large companies, Oracle already has a direct relationship with customers, which it can now use for moving hardware. Unlike H.P. and Dell, Oracle will have the flexibility of altering the price of its software in deals where customers want bundles of computing products.
 Mr. Ellison played down such potential pricing advantages on the bundles. Instead, he said Oracle would save customers money by gluing all of the technology together.
 Mr. Ellison added that Oracle would sell products directly to Sun's top 4,000 customers, which accounted for about 70 percent of its revenue, rather than relying on partners as Sun had in the past.
 ''Sun has wonderful engineering, but they didn't seem to like selling very much,'' Mr. Ellison said. ''The partner model was disastrous, and we are immediately changing that.''
 Sun had suffered from years of declining sales and layoffs. People familiar with the company's culture have worried that morale will only worsen as Oracle takes over the company and begins another round of layoffs.
 While Oracle's purchase of Sun has sent shock waves through the technology industry, Mr. Ellison insisted that his relationships with Michael S. Dell, the chief executive of Dell, and Mark V. Hurd, the chief executive of H.P., remained cordial.
 ''I am a good friend with Michael,'' Mr. Ellison said.
 And Mr. Hurd, an avid tennis player, is still welcome to hit the courts at Mr. Ellison's home.
 ''Absolutely,'' Mr. Ellison said. ''He has a big serve.''

HEADLINE: Searching for the Perfect Job Subsidy Plan

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
Legislators are showing renewed interest in proposals for a government subsidy to encourage new hiring. President Obama last month endorsed the idea of a tax incentive for companies that add jobs, and many will be listening for more details in his State of the Union speech Wednesday night.
 Faced with populist anger about economic conditions, Washington has been looking for ways to promote job growth, with things like public works projects and aid for states. Many of these proposals, however, have been stymied by a partisan divide over economic policy and concerns about the deficit. 
 A tax break that would appeal to both workers and buinesses could potentially bridge that divide, assuming that some problems are worked out. 
 The biggest challenge is how to create a policy that minimizes businesses' ability to manipulate the system, but that is still simple enough for employers to actually understand and use. The difficulty of striking that balance may explain why the proposal has resurfaced in so many configurations in recent weeks.
 On Tuesday alone, three prominent senators -- Charles E. Schumer of New York, Orrin Hatch of Utah, and Al Franken of Minnesota -- announced two separate plans for hiring subsidies. Earlier this month, Representative Bob Etheridge, Democrat of North Carolina, submitted a similar proposal. Mr. Obama presented a vague version of the proposal as part of a broad job creation plan last month.
 The federal government last tried a job-creation tax credit in the 1970s. That policy was generally considered successful, but economists debate which portion of the jobs would have been created anyway.
 A recent Congressional Budget Officereport estimated that a payroll tax cut for new hires would most likely have a bigger bang per buck -- in terms of jobs created per dollar spent this year -- than other major policies on the table. It might also give a bigger kick to overall output than most other stimulus programs in play, with the exception of increased unemployment benefits. 
 Concerns remain, however, about whether employers might manipulate the system -- for example, by firing existing workers only to rehire them at a discount, or replacing one full-time worker with two part-time workers.
 For this reason, legislators have placed creative restrictions in their hiring subsidy proposals. For example, the Schumer-Hatch plan (which the senators described in an Op-Ed article in The New York Times but have not yet introduced into the Senate) says that new hires who work fewer than 30 hours a week are not eligible for the tax subsidy. 
 Additionally, only hires of workers who have not been employed in the last 60 days can qualify for the tax deal, to encourage companies to hire an unemployed worker rather than one from another firm.
 ''You have to find someone you can prove has been out of work for a set amount of time, who also happens to meet the qualifications of the job you're trying to fill,'' said Bill Rhys, tax counsel with the National Federation of Independent Business. ''We certainly want to find ways to get people out of the work force back into jobs, but the more conditions you put on that, the less effective it becomes.''
 Debate continues on which conditions are necessary.
 ''We tried to balance the legitimate criticism that you want to make sure that this goes only to people who are actual new hires with the fact that you want to make it easy to use,'' Mr. Schumer said. 
 The technical minutiae can have big implications for the effectiveness of the policy and its ultimate cost. Taking the time to iron out wrinkles and devise the fairest, smartest policy possible could undermine the program by causing employers to delay their hiring while they wait to see whether a subsidy materializes.
 ''I hope they enact it quickly, but knowing the way things work in Washington, they probably won't do it until December,'' said Daniel S. Hamermesh, an economics professor at the University of Texas at Austin who helped plan the 1970s new jobs tax credit. ''By that time the job market will be picking up anyway and it won't do as much good.''

HEADLINE: Home Depot Plans to Cut 1,000 Jobs

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Home Depot Inc., the home-improvement retailer, said Tuesday that it was laying off 1,000 employees as it cuts three pilot programs and cuts some support positions.
 An internal memorandum sent to employees by the chief executive, Frank Blake, said about 900 cuts stem from consolidating some support functions in its human resources, finance and other divisions. 
 The rest come from closing a small-format pilot store in Wilson, N.C.; a temporary hurricane recovery outlet in Waveland, Miss.; and a clearance outlet in Austell, Ga. Mr. Blake said in the memo there were no plans to close any full-size Home Depot stores.
 The cuts are less than 1 percent of Home Depot's more than 300,000 workers.
 A Home Depot spokesman, Ron Defeo, said as part of the reorganization the company would create 200 jobs in Atlanta, where most human resources administration would be handled, although there would still be a field human resources team.
 Home Depot, based in Atlanta, and other home-improvement retailers have faced sales declines from the long-standing construction slowdown and consumers holding back on do-it-yourself projects amid worry over jobs and home values. Although the housing market is stabilizing, after a nearly three-year decline, home prices remain far below their peak.
 Home Depot's profit is about even with last year for the first nine months, a period that ended Nov. 1, while revenue is down about 9 percent.
 ''This is not a case of the company cutting expenses in reaction to broader economic pressures or our business performance,'' Mr. Blake said in the memo. ''We are making prudent structural changes where it makes business sense to consolidate some functions.''

HEADLINE: Voters in Oregon Approve Tax Increases

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

 BODY:
Amid recession, high unemployment and tight household budgets, voters in Oregon have agreed to raise taxes on people with higher incomes, to pay for public education and social services. 
 One of only five states with no sales tax, Oregon has long kept its corporate taxes relatively low. A statewide cap limits how much property taxes can rise, and before Tuesday voters had not approved a statewide income tax increase in nearly 80 years. 
 Each of the two tax proposals, Measures 66 and 67, won decisively, in part because of support from large labor unions and because of how the taxes are directed. 
 Measure 66 raises taxes on individuals earning more than $125,000 a year and on couples whose income exceeds $250,000. Measure 67 raises taxes on businesses. Some will see their taxes increase by tens of thousands of dollars, but many more will be subject to only modest increases, including a rise in the corporate minimum tax to $150 from $10. 
 ''It was a pretty good offer the proponents were making,'' Pat McCormick, a spokesman for the lead opposition group, Oregonians Against Job-Killing Taxes, said sarcastically. ''Here's a way of paying for things that's not going to cost you anything.'' 
 Supporters, led by teachers' and public employees' unions, spent about $7 million on the campaign, including television commercials and mailers that portrayed middle-class residents struggling far more than the wealthy and big business, from Wall Street executives to credit card companies.
 ''That was virtually the theme of all of them, that these were folks who were getting out of having to pay their fair share,'' Mr. McCormick said. ''They used that term, 'protect' the middle class.''
 Charles Sheketoff, executive director of the Oregon Center for Public Policy, one of the groups that pushed for the tax increases, said the campaign was not about class.
 ''It's not that it was targeted at the rich,'' he said. ''It was targeted at the right people, those with the ability to pay. It made the system more progressive.''
 Mr. Sheketoff and Mr. McCormick both said the political climate in Oregon during the campaign shared some populist similarities with those on display in the recent Senate race in Massachusetts in which the Republican Party and Tea Party groups helped elect Scott Brown, a Republican, to the seat long held by the late Edward M. Kennedy. 
 Mr. McCormick said both elections ''tapped into the anger that voters feel.'' 
 Mr. Sheketoff, however, suggested that the ''true populism'' was on display in Oregon, and that conservatives elsewhere had ''tried to hijack the term.'' 
 Mr. Sheketoff said the Oregon campaign was ''definitely a template'' for other states trying to raise revenues. Experts noted that legislative sessions are just getting under way in many states, but Mr. Sheketoff said he had already been contacted for advice by allies in Oregon's neighboring West Coast states, Washington and California.

HEADLINE: A Reminder Of Precedents In Subsidizing Newspapers

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
American newspapers have relied on government subsidies since Washington's day, but that support has dropped sharply in the last four decades, according to a report to be released Thursday by the University of Southern California. 
 In the last year, the industry's financial woes have prompted much debate about what government can do to support the news media -- and much hand-wringing about the risk of journalists being beholden to government.
 But the authors of the new study say government support is nothing new, though even many journalists are unaware of it.
 ''We think it's important for people to understand that the government has been involved from the beginning, and that the subsidies were much larger in the past,'' said Geoffrey Cowan, dean emeritus of the university's Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism.
 He and his co-author, David Westphal, the school's executive in residence, said that in today's dollars, government support for newspapers and magazines had fallen to less than $2 billion from more than $4 billion in 1970.
 The federal government has discounted postage rates for publications since 1792, but in the last 40 years, the discount has fallen to less than $300 million from almost $2 billion, adjusted for inflation.
 Local, state and federal governments regularly buy notices in newspapers, about things like public hearings, regulations and budgets, which Mr. Westphal said were probably worth more than $1 billion a year. But many agencies are lobbying to stop that practice and publish their notices only on their own Web sites.
 The study did not take into account notices published by private interests, like drug makers, that are required by law.
 State and federal laws also give an array of tax breaks to publications, which the authors said were worth at least $900 million a year.
 The report does not embrace specific measures to aid print media, but, Mr. Cowan said, ''we hope that it helps to reframe the debate.''

HEADLINE: Will You Be My Frugal Valentine?

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
MADISON AVENUE is going high and low for Valentine's Day, as in low prices and high technology.
 Valentine's Day is always among the most commercialized holidays on the marketing calendar, offering retailers and advertisers a chance to extract money from those consumers who have managed to refill bank accounts after depleting them for Christmas shopping. The National Retail Federation estimates that Americans spent $14.7 billion last year on Valentine's Day purchases.
 This year, however, is the third Valentine's Day since the recession and financial crisis turned most Americans into savers rather than spenders. In fact, the billions spent for the holiday in 2009 represented a decline of 13.5 percent from the $17 billion spent in 2008, according to the federation. 
 The result, with apologies to Rodgers and Hart, is that for 2010, frugal valentines are likely to supplant funny ones. The mood is epitomized by the cover of the Feb. 17 issue of Woman's Day magazine. Next to a photograph of a heart-shaped chocolate dessert on a pink plate are these words: ''Cheaper, Faster, Better!''
 So retailers are putting Valentine's Day merchandise on sale, like Target's ''weekly wow'' special of bags of valentine-themed candies at $3.99 each, an offer of 15 percent off flowers bearing the Martha Stewart brand at 1-800-Flowers.com and 20 percent off Figi's valentine chocolates and cookies at Walgreens.com.
 The deal for free shipping at Walgreens.com on orders of $25 or more even has a Cupid-style coupon code, ''LOVE25.''
 And the White Castle fast-food chain is repeating an annual Valentine's Day promotion that calls for participating restaurants to serve only couples who make reservations for romantic dinners for two.
 ''Wow your special someone with tableside service, flowers and candlelight,'' declares an announcement on the White Castle Web site (whitecastle.com), ''in a place made famous for late-night cravings.'' Prices start at $10.49 for a meal for two of 10 hamburgers, two orders of French fries and two 21-ounce sodas.
 In a study released on Wednesday by the Context-Based Research Group and Carton Donofrio Partners, both based in Baltimore, 88 percent of respondents said they had taken steps to spend less and 83 percent said they had made permanent changes in spending and saving behavior.
 ''We believe the changes in behavior represent a permanent shift,'' said Cleve Corlett, director for quantitative research at Context-Based Research, ''because they come from a deep evaluation of personal beliefs.''
 A search of Google on Wednesday afternoon for ''Valentine's Day deals'' brought 653,000 results, followed by 246,000 for ''Valentine's Day sales,'' 13,000 for ''Valentine's Day discounts'' and 3,140 for ''Valentine's Day bargains.''
 The idea of consulting a search engine for off-price hearts or other thrifty purchases underscores how many Valentine's Day promotions feature high-technology elements, particularly social media outlets like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.
 For instance, White Castle is offering to upload photographs of the Valentine's Day diners to its Web site. And visitors to the Web site are invited to share information about the promotion through Twitter.
 A big part of the Valentine's Day drum-beating by the Macy's department store chain is a contest to take place on Twitter that will seek what the retailer calls the ''sweetest Tweets.'' 
 Love notes of 140 characters or fewer posted on Twitter from Feb. 1 through Feb. 13 that include the hashtag #sweetesttweets in the message will be eligible to win a diamond pendant set; on Feb. 14, everyone who sent such messages will be entered to win the grand prize of a diamond ring. 
 As Macy's makes its Valentine's Day ad plans, ''we like to change it up'' from year to year ''to make it more exciting, more relevant,'' said Martine Reardon, executive vice president for marketing at Macy's.
 ''Twitter happens to be where people are today,'' she added, ''so we thought it would be fun'' to feature it in the campaign. More than 6,000 people follow Macy's on Twitter, Ms. Reardon said, where the retailer has had an account since June.
 There is a risk that a Twitter contest could be deemed the 2010 equivalent of asking shoppers in the mid-1990s to take part in the world's largest Macarena dance contest.
 ''I wish I had a crystal ball to tell me if it was a fad or a trend,'' Ms. Reardon said. ''But social media is real.''
 The tongue-in-cheek aspects of Macy's seeking ''Tweethearts'' is indicative of a humorous approach that many campaigns are taking this year. The goal is to entertain consumers and offset concerns about the economy.
 Another example is a commercial for Verizon Wireless that spoofs the familiar spots for De Beers diamonds, filmed in black and white, depicting romantic couples casting shadows.
 The Verizon commercial looks like an ad for De Beers until it is revealed that the Valentine's Day gift in question is not a diamond but a smartphone, and a woman rejects a man who gives her a phone because it is from AT&T.
 The commercial ends with a second couple's clinch after he gives his love a Verizon phone instead. The commercial was created by McCann Erickson Worldwide in New York, part of the McCann Worldgroup division of the Interpublic Group of Companies.

HEADLINE: Ozawa and James Taylor to Headline Carnegie Season

BYLINE: By DANIEL J. WAKIN

 BODY:
Carnegie Hall, famed for the classical music luminaries on its stage, will give the singer-songwriter James Taylor pride of place next season. At the other end of the musical spectrum, the violinist Christian Tetzlaff will also be featured.
 Announcing its 2010-11 season on Wednesday -- the second in a row under an austere budget -- Carnegie said it had assigned a high-profile Perspectives series to each performer. The hall will also present a festival dedicated to Japan, led by Seiji Ozawa, continuing its practice of showcasing a culture or theme through a variety of performances in different locales. Past subjects have included Berlin, black Americans and Leonard Bernstein.
 The Japan festival is set for December, with a second round to follow in March and April. It will feature dance, Noh theater, taiko drumming, art exhibitions, manga and jazz, as well as performances by orchestras partly founded by Mr. Ozawa: the Saito Kinen Orchestra and the Seiji Ozawa Ongaku-juku, part of an academy established by the conductor. 
 ''I am getting older, and I feel we have so many things in Japan to feel proud of today,'' Mr. Ozawa said in a video clip played at a news conference at Carnegie Hall. Mr. Ozawa disclosed two weeks ago that he had esophageal cancer. Clive Gillinson, Carnegie's executive and artistic director, said Mr. Ozawa and his doctors were ''totally confident that he'll be fine.''
 This season's festival focused on China. Japan was chosen for next season, Mr. Gillinson said, because juxtaposing the two cultures ''was a really, really interesting idea.'' People assume they are ''superficially similar cultures,'' he added, ''and yet they couldn't be more different.'' 
 Prominent Japanese companies have signed on as leading financers of the festival, called JapanNYC, including the Epson Corporation, Mizuho Securities U.S.A., Nomura Holding America and the Sony Corporation. The main individual donor is Yoko Nagae Ceschina, a major supporter of classical music who helped pay for the New York Philharmonic's trip to North Korea in 2008. More than 40 events are planned, and like the Chinese festival this season the Japanese event will be presented jointly with the Philharmonic Society of Orange County in California, where it will be called JapanOC.
 In another highlight Valery Gergiev will conduct the Maryinsky Orchestra of St. Petersburg in five concerts of Mahler symphonies, part of a Mahler cycle that will also play at Avery Fisher Hall with the London Symphony Orchestra. 
 Mr. Gillinson said Mr. Gergiev came to Carnegie with the idea of performing the entire cycle in New York next season. But the Staatskapelle Berlin, conducted by Daniel Barenboim and Pierre Boulez, just ran through the Mahler symphonies at Carnegie last spring. ''We weren't going to do a complete Mahler cycle again,'' Mr. Gillinson said. 
 The Vienna Philharmonic will open the Carnegie Hall season with four concerts, with podium duties shared by Nikolaus Harnoncourt and Gustavo Dudamel. Also, musicians from the Risor Chamber Music Festival in Norway, led by a Carnegie favorite, the pianist Leif Ove Andsnes, will present four programs; the jazz pianist Brad Mehldau will be the composer in residence; Riccardo Muti gives his first New York concerts as music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra; and the New York Philharmonic and its music director, Alan Gilbert, along with Yo-Yo Ma, Emanuel Ax, Gil Shaham and Audra McDonald, take part in a gala concert on May 5, 2011, the 120th anniversary of the opening of the hall. (The inaugural concert was also Tchaikovsky's American conducting debut.)
 Unlike other Perspectives artists, who often lead workshops and teach, Mr. Taylor will simply perform on four evenings in April and May. Mr. Taylor will play with guest artists, his band and guitarist colleagues. One concert will be a gala celebration of Carnegie's history. Mr. Taylor said at the news conference that he felt the weight of leading a series at what he called a ''great hallowed place,'' where he first performed in 1970 at 22. (He said the concert convinced his mother he could finally make a living in music.) ''Certainly it's an honor, and a little bit terrifying,'' he said.
 Because of cost cuts, this season and next, Carnegie is presenting about 180 events on a budget of $70 million, down from 200 events on budgets of $76 million in 2008-9 and $84 million in 2007-8, Mr. Gillinson said.
 Meanwhile Carnegie has taken on debt to pay for the renovation of two towers at the top of the building on Seventh Avenue between 57th and 56th Streets. Once given over to studios and apartments rented to individuals, commercial tenants and artists, the space will become home to Carnegie's growing educational programs. The $200 million renovation project also calls for backstage improvements to the main auditorium and the smaller Zankel and Weill halls.
 New York City issued $110 million in bonds last November on Carnegie's behalf to help pay for the renovation and replace $41 million in bonds used to create Zankel Hall. The issue will cost the institution about $5.4 million in annual interest payments starting three years from now. At the same time Carnegie had to pay about $6.1 million when it ended an interest-rate swap, a financial transaction that served as a hedge against the cost of the Zankel bonds. Mr. Gillinson said such losses for institutions were not unusual in the downturn.
 Ratings agencies have looked favorably on the bond offering. Standard & Poor's gave it an A+ and Moody's Investors Service an A1. But the agencies noted that paying for the debt depended on donations and ticket sales, two uncertain sources of money.
 And Moody's said Carnegie's total debt of $116 million had a maximum debt service -- the money needed to repay interest and principal -- of $9.8 million a year, or about 12 percent of last season's operating expenses, double the median debt service for nonprofits. Mr. Gillinson disputed those figures, saying that $10 million in bond proceeds, in addition to money set aside for the Zankel bond payments, will cover the first three years of interest, and that no principal will be repaid for 15 years.
 By the time Carnegie faces the $5.4 million a year in interest, he said, fund-raising will have kicked into gear, and money should be on hand for the payments. He said that costs associated with the increased debt would not cut into performances and stressed that fund-raising for the renovation was separate from the money raised for operating the hall.
 The bond issue -- which is officially made by the Trust for Cultural Resources of the City of New York -- was arranged by Sanford I. Weill, Carnegie's board chairman and the former chairman of Citigroup. Citigroup Global Markets is the lead underwriter, joined by Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley, each of which received a portion of $1.7 million in fees to arrange the bond issue. 
 Included in Carnegie's overall debt picture is a $5.4 million loan for a luxury apartment at 63rd Street and Lexington Avenue intended for use by the executive and artistic director. ''It wasn't something I asked for,'' Mr. Gillinson said, but the board of directors felt that Carnegie's top official needed a suitable residence to wine and dine potential donors as well as artists.
 He added that when the economy took a nose dive in 2008, he proposed renting the apartment out to earn Carnegie some income. He said the tenant left after a year, and he moved in at the end of September.

HEADLINE: Firm Guiding Construction Stole Millions, Officials Say

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI; John Eligon contributed reporting.

 BODY:
A construction management company was indicted Wednesday on charges that it stole nearly $7 million from clients at five condominium and office projects in the New York area as part of a scheme involving fake invoices and kickbacks from its subcontractors.
 The company, the Builders Group, and its three officers -- George Figliolia, Isaac Stareshefsky and John Krupa -- were charged with multiple counts of grand larceny relating to office renovations at Rockefeller Center, a luxury condominium conversion near Madison Square Park and a renovation at a data center in New Jersey. 
 The indictment in State Supreme Court in Manhattan highlights the resilience of corruption in the construction industry in New York. A vast investigation a decade ago centered on the same sort of accusations and ensnared some of the city's biggest contractors in interior construction, resulting in three dozen convictions and $32 million in fines.
 In a separate case six years ago, Mr. Figliolia's brother, Alex Figliolia Sr., a plumbing contractor, pleaded guilty to bribing executives at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and stealing from the authority by overcharging for his work.
 In the current case, the Builders Group had an obligation as construction manager to obtain the lowest prices for its clients. But it typically submitted inflated bills from subcontractors, who were directed to secretly send the overbilled amounts to companies controlled by the Builders Group or its principals, according to the indictment.
 The Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., said that fraud of this kind generally increased the already high cost of construction in the city by as much as 10 percent.
 ''The broader implication of cases like this, and this case, are substantial,'' Mr. Vance said in announcing the indictment, his first since taking office Jan. 1. ''Even in tough economic times, construction costs in New York City are expected to reach $25 billion in 2010.''
 Although the investigation was begun under his predecessor, Robert M. Morgenthau, Mr. Vance signaled last year that corruption in the construction industry would be a focus of his administration. Mr. Vance said Wednesday that the indictment emerged from investigations by his office's construction industry strike force and the special investigations unit of the State Police.
 The Builders Group and its three principals pleaded not guilty. In a statement from their lawyers, the men vowed to ''vigorously defend against these allegations.''
 ''Simply put, there was no fraud,'' said Benjamin Brafman, a lawyer for Mr. Krupa. ''There was no theft. These are honest men working for an honest company.'' 
 The accusations against the Builders Group resemble those that surfaced in 1998 and 1999 when prosecutors, after a five-year investigation, rocked the $6 billion interior construction industry by indicting and gaining convictions of five major contractors, including the industry leader, Structure Tone, as well as 24 other companies and dozens of architects and real estate brokers. 
 Structure Tone and the four other major contractors pleaded guilty to participating in an elaborate scheme to rig the bidding on $2 billion worth of renovation work for a roster of blue-chip companies in Manhattan: Sony, Credit Suisse First Boston, Morgan Stanley, Bertelsmann and Gleacher & Company. Structure Tone, the biggest beneficiary of the scheme, paid $10 million in lieu of fines and forfeitures.
 But that investigation also led to some cynicism about combating corruption in the industry. Sixteen weeks after he went to prison, Robert N. Bennis, the mastermind of the scheme, went to work as a consultant supervising construction on the Conde Nast tower in Times Square as part of his work release program. Mr. Bennis had been sentenced to up to three years in prison and fined $1.65 million after pleading guilty to commercial bribery.
 ''In the case of Bennis, it looks like crime pays,'' John Osborn, a lawyer who represents landlords, architects and engineers, said at the time.
 Mr. Vance did not identify the five companies that were forced by the Builders Group to pay inflated construction bills.
 But according to an investigator briefed on the case, the largest fraud occurred at data centers in Bergen County, N.J., that are owned by Equinix, formerly Switch and Data Facilities. The company was overcharged by about $3 million, the investigator said.
 In another instance, the Builders Group took in more than $2 million in illegal overcharges at 15 Madison Square North, near Fifth Avenue, investigators determined. The real estate company Walter & Samuels hired the Builders Group to oversee the conversion of the top 12 floors in the 20-story office building into condominiums. Walter & Samuels did not return calls requesting comment. 
 The Builders Group also extracted nearly $1 million in kickbacks while building offices for Ulysses Management, an investment firm, at 1 Rockefeller Plaza, the investigator said.

HEADLINE: An Unlikely Haven for Rock 'n' Roll Entrepreneurs

BYLINE: By ROBERT STRAUSS

DATELINE: LITITZ, Pa. 

 BODY:
This small town in Pennsylvania Dutch country, in the midst of cornfields and dairy farms, would seem an unlikely home for a warehouse filled with the detritus of rock concerts past and future -- a large section of the stage for the next Black Eyed Peas tour, the sets for an Elton John concert and gigantic lips from the Rolling Stones.
 But Michael Tait, whose stage-building and designing company Tait Towers, owns the warehouse, said life in Lititz was too good to move elsewhere. In fact, Mr. Tait said, if any of his employees are ever interested in going elsewhere for a job, he'll pay their expenses while looking.
 ''It's worth it,'' he said. ''They almost always come back. You could go to L.A. or New York, but it would never be as comfortable and it would surely be more expensive.'' 
 Lititz (pronounced LIT-itz), population 9,000 and about a dozen miles north of Lancaster, is a haven of sorts to other small businesses. Clair Brothers, which says it is the biggest rock sound-system company in the country, is there, as is Atomic Design, which does a lot of the backdrops for music and theatrical staging. 
 And beyond music-related businesses, there is an unusual combination of other companies whose products or expertise are known beyond the Lititz town limits: Woodstream, which produces the Victor mousetrap; Wilbur Chocolate, maker of a Hershey Kiss competitor, Wilbur Buds; Sturgis Pretzels, which says it is America's first commercial pretzel maker; and Lititz Watch Technicum, a school where Rolex watchmakers study. 
 To Barry Miller, the director of retail banking for Susquehanna Bankshares, Lititz is a natural business haven. Susquehanna itself is now a $14 billion enterprise, but its headquarters remains in Lititz, where it was founded at the turn of the last century.
 ''There is just a formidable work ethic in Lancaster County, the hearty farmers who saw the Amish and the Mennonites around here working so hard,'' Mr. Miller said. ''Then there is an innovative, entrepreneurial streak here, too. Finally, there is the loyalty. The owners want to give jobs to local people and keep them here forever.''
 The rock business, for instance, started just that way. Roy Clair and his older brother, Gene, who grew up in Lititz, got a rudimentary sound system as a present from their father when they were in their teens in the 1960s. They started setting it up for pin money at high school dances, and then for events at Franklin & Marshall College, in Lancaster. In 1966, they did the sound for a Dionne Warwick concert, and then one for Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons.
 ''What we didn't know is that the concert just before, they were at the Fontainebleau in Miami with Herb Alpert, and Herb, an engineer, wouldn't let them use his sound system,'' Roy Clair said. ''So when they got here, they sounded so much better, their wives were impressed. They asked us to do the rest of their tour -- we may have been the first sound guys to tour with a band -- and the rest, as they say, is rock history. We kept getting word-of-mouth business.''
 But the Clairs also loved Lititz and found ways to truck their sound systems, as they became more elaborate, from there. They hired local people and taught them how to enhance and modify the systems -- louder, crisper, more hidden or more out-there, as the rockers wanted.
 Along the way, they met Michael Tait, an Australian who was doing production and lighting for the British band Yes. He wanted to go out on his own and, he said, ended up sleeping on Gene Clair's couch until he could get his business going. He, in turn, persuaded a British artist friend, Tom McPhillips, to come to Lititz and do the artistic part of the stages, as Atomic Design, while Tait Towers did the engineering.
 From his office perch on the second floor of a mini-industrial park, Mr. Tait -- whose anonymous four buildings have no sign identifying them as Tait Towers -- can see the Clair Brothers' factory and warehouse just past a farmhouse, and then look right toward Atomic Design's studios. Tait employs about 130 designers, technicians, welders, machinists and assemblers and, like those at Clair and Atomic, almost all of them come from a 20-mile radius.
 ''There is a tremendously motivated population here, but I guess that is tradition,'' Mr. Tait said. ''There are motor heads and rockers and just plain machinists and smart people, a good sampling. Plus, they want to stay here. Look out, it's a beautiful life. If you want to go somewhere, it's two and a half hours to New York.''
 Wilbur Chocolate no longer qualifies as a small business, since it is now owned by Cargill, but the chocolates are still made at the 125-year-old factory on North Broad Street, hard by the railroad stop. There is a homey museum and factory outlet there, its centerpiece the Wilbur Bud, a $6-a-pound upscale version of the Hershey Kiss.
 Julius Sturgis started his pretzel-making business in town in 1861, and the Woolworth family still runs Woodstream, which traces its roots to 1899 and the first Victor snap-action mousetrap. Woodstream has since made a billion of them, and also has a long line of other pest control machines and poisons.
 Each of the businesses employs from a couple of dozen to a couple of hundred people, and none had significant layoffs during the recession.
 ''I guess we were never hit badly,'' said Gaylord Poling, the chairman of Venture Lititz, the town's business promotion arm. ''Maybe it's because we are conservative enough here that we always bought and sold $300,000 houses for $300,000, not $600,000.'' 
 Mr. Poling added: ''There are no big-box stores here and the only chain I can think of is the Subway downtown. Every other store is local.''
 Soren West, now president of Atomic Design, grew up in Lancaster County, but said that when he was younger he had to get away. He became a ski instructor in Colorado and was a professional cyclist and art gallery owner. Then he was passing through Lititz and heard about Atomic and Mr. McPhillips. 
 ''It was 14 years ago and I begged Tom to hire me, to do anything,'' Mr. West said. ''I was really coming home. We have a little art colony of sorts in the county, with a couple of art schools and lots of small galleries.''
 ''You say, 'Why Lititz?' and I say, 'Why not?' '' Mr. West said. ''You get the stimulation without the hype, and no one is in anyone's face.''
 Roy Clair tells the story of the time Billy Joel came to town to check up on a sound system for a forthcoming tour. 
 ''He was in a limo or at least had a driver,'' Mr. Clair said, stopping to chuckle. ''So he's on one of the main streets and rolls down the window to ask someone where Clair Brothers is. The guy looks at him and says: 'I can't tell you. They don't like people to know.' I mean, this is Billy Joel. But this is also Lititz, where they respect a local business.''

CORRECTION-DATE: February 1, 2010

HEADLINE: Sales of New Homes Fell 7.6% in December

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Sales of new homes unexpectedly fell 7.6 percent last month, capping the industry's weakest year on record.
 December's sales fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 342,000 from an upwardly revised November pace of 370,000, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. Economists surveyed by Thomson Reuters had forecast a pace of 370,000 for December. 
 The results were the weakest since March and indicated demand remained sluggish despite newly expanded tax incentives to spur sales. The report will probably fuel concern that the housing market turnaround will falter when government support ends this spring.
 Tom Brown, co-owner of Crown Home Builders in Summerville, S.C., was not surprised that last month was poor. Buyers are having trouble meeting tough criteria for mortgage loans, he said. And though builders are cutting prices, the shaky economy and weak job market are keeping home shoppers away.
 ''People are holding on to what they have,'' he said.
 Only 374,000 homes were sold last year, down 23 percent from a year earlier and the weakest year on record dating back to 1963. December's sales were nearly 9 percent below the same month last year. This year, the National Association of Homebuilders is forecasting more than 500,000 sales.
 Even if that happens, ''it hardly makes you ecstatic,'' said Bernard M. Markstein, senior economist at the trade group, noting that the industry clocked more than 1 million sales a year from 2003 through 2006
 Home sales have had a rocky recovery from their four-year slide. December's sales pace for new homes was up 4 percent from the bottom in January 2009, but down 75 percent from the peak in July 2005.
 The median sales price of $221,300 in December was down nearly 4 percent from $229,600 a year earlier, but up about 5 percent from November's median of $210,300.
 New-home sales varied widely across the country. Sales of new homes plummeted by 41 percent in the Midwest and fell by 7 percent in the South. But they skyrocketed 43 percent in the Northeast and rose 5 percent in the West.
 Any housing recovery this year will probably be slow. Experts forecast sales of new and previously occupied homes to weaken after tax credits for homebuyers expire in April.
 So far, the housing recovery has been fueled mainly by hundreds of billions in federal spending that has pushed down mortgage rates and propped up demand. Congress decided last year to extend a tax credit of up to $8,000 for first-time buyers until the end of April. Homeowners who have lived in their current properties for at least five years can claim a tax credit of up to $6,500 if they relocate.

HEADLINE: The Faces of American Populism

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 David Brooks's column about populism (''The Populist Addiction,'' Jan. 26) depicts the sorry tradition of us-versus-them demagogy in American history. But there is a different tradition of democratic populism, based on the view that while leaders like Alexander Hamilton and Abraham Lincoln play noteworthy roles, it takes ordinary citizens to ''build America.''
 This view was central to the cooperatives of black and white small farmers of the late 19th century at the base of the Populist Party, the labor movements of the 1930s and the civil rights struggle in the 1950s and 1960s. All were populist, challenging unaccountable elites while also emphasizing the responsibility of all in creating ''a more perfect union.'' 
 They all included large programs of popular self-education and uplift out of the belief that a commonwealth of freedom, to use a 19th-century idiom worth recalling, requires a commonwealth of citizens.
 Harry C. Boyte Co-director Center for Democracy and Citizenship Minneapolis, Jan. 26, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Populists like me don't want to ''punish'' the elites. We simply ask that Main Street and Wall Street play by the same rules. We can't get 0.5 percent loans at the Fed's discount window, so banks shouldn't either. We won't be bailed out of debt, so banks shouldn't be either.
 Populists want elites to be treated fairly -- just like the rest of us.
 Andrew Barnet Williamstown, Mass., Jan. 26, 2010
 To the Editor:
 I object to David Brooks's depiction of the core values of populism and the concerns of families we fight for every day.
 I started the House Populist Caucus for the sole purpose of promoting policies and supporting legislation that will strengthen and expand the middle class. Contrary to Mr. Brooks's position, populism is not about divisive rhetoric or class warfare. 
 True populism is about giving voice to the legitimate concerns of Americans who make America great: the right to a decent education and a well-paying job, access to quality and affordable health care, fair trade policies and consumer protection from powerful corporations. 
 True populism is about building America up, not tearing it down. True populism understands the critical importance of investing in America's middle-class families -- spurring job creation and economic growth. 
 Is Mr. Brooks correct in saying populism is in vogue? Seemingly. Politicians across the spectrum are jumping on the ''populist'' bandwagon, attempting to harness the anger and frustration of middle-class voters. 
 But strengthening America's middle class is neither a trend nor a fad nor combative divisiveness. It's the essence of what makes America great.
 Bruce Braley Washington, Jan. 26, 2010
 The writer, a Democrat, represents the First Congressional District in Iowa. 
 To the Editor:
 It's not just the populist who, as David Brooks says, ''absolves voters of responsibility for their problems.'' It's also almost every politician and elected official. 
 One of the bedrock rules of political life is never to blame the American people: we are invariably decent, generous, hard-working, wise and, always, better than the people who govern us.
 Steven Berkowitz New York, Jan. 26, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Republicans have been incredibly successful in harnessing populism while directing their policy efforts to support the elite and big business. It's an unbelievable balancing act.

HEADLINE: Its Owner Gone, a Music Shop Preserves a Fading Sound

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

DATELINE: CLIFTON, N.J. 

 BODY:
 In the front of Ronnie I's Clifton Music is a 2,000-pound granite tombstone dedicated in 1988 to the pioneering rock 'n' roll singer Frankie Lymon of the Teenagers -- bought with $3,000 in donations and then never used when his widow decided she did not want it.
 Attached to the tin ceiling are old LPs and 45s, hanging overhead like shiny planets from some forgotten galaxy. 
 In the bins of CDs, LPs, 45s, and 78s are thousands of reminders of the music invariably thought of as the soundtrack to the 1950s -- the Five Satins, Ink Spots, Spaniels and Harptones, the Cardinals, Wrens, Orioles and Larks.
 What is not there, not anymore, is Ronnie I -- Ronnie Italiano, the indefatigable, happily obsessed fan, promoter and entrepreneur of early group harmony rock 'n' roll who ran the store from 1972 until he died in 2008 at 67.
 Rock 'n' roll will never die, as Danny and the Juniors noted long before Neil Young did. But, alas, we will, and most of what we did often disappears with us. So who knows how long Ronnie I's shop can outlive Ronnie I. But on Main Street in Clifton, a respectful hat tip to this time capsule to a time capsule and the fragile sliver of musical history it still represents. 
 Ronnie I, who grew up in East Rutherford, hated the term doo-wop, which he considered an inauthentic parody of what he preferred to call vocal group harmony. But for the music forever associated with its intricate harmonies and bops, pows, yips and other vocal filigrees -- ''Earth Angel,'' ''Why Do Fools Fall in Love,'' ''Sh-Boom'' -- it is the term people know, hence those Doo Wop University sweatshirts on sale at the shop.
 If Ronnie hated the term, he loved the music with a manic passion. So when the local record store came up for sale, he ditched his job driving a soda delivery truck and jumped in. For a few years he maintained a general music business. Then he went all-in on the sound he loved -- no Elvis, no Bill Haley and His Comets; all doo-wop, all the time.
 He sold it at the store. He recorded it on his Clifton record label. He brought dozens of groups back together to perform and record. He did radio broadcasts, put on shows, wrote about it, dreamed about it. Most important, perhaps, he founded the United in Group Harmony Association, which at its peak had 2,000 members (Paul Simon among them) who turned out for the hundreds of shows he put on.
 ''He worked 24 hours a day, seven days a week,'' said Bill Olb, a friend from the store's beginnings. ''He was in the recording studio, he was in the store, he did more than 500 concert shows, 100 record releases, more than 60 albums and CDs. There's no replacement for Ronnie I. Everyone knows that.''
 It was an uphill battle. Even on oldies radio, oldies long ago came to mean the Beatles and the Supremes, not the Impalas and the Hurricanes. And then came a bout with cancer, a final trip from the hospital to host the group harmony association meeting and show No. 354, and then he was gone, March 4, 2008.
 The store is now run by his widow, Sandra, who grew up in the 1980s in love with doo-wop while her friends were listening to Duran Duran. She met Ronnie at one of his shows in 1994, when she was 23, and married him a year later. 
 Mrs. I would like to keep the store going as long as possible, increasingly depending on the store's online sales, but nothing's certain. 
 ''I think about it all the time,'' she said. ''If the economy picks up and people start buying, I'll be here for a while. If it doesn't, I don't know. I'd hate to close the door to the shop. It would be closing the door on history, closing the door on my husband's dream.''
 Most of the faithful who used to hang out on Saturdays have moved to Florida or died. The stores in town increasingly reflect the influx of immigrants: a Colombian bakery across the street, Bent al Sultan Fashions a few doors down. Over an hour or two one day this week, two people walked in, one looking confused, the other looking for someone to repair a fax machine.
 There was always something innocent and haunting about the music Ronnie I loved and something ephemeral, too -- Moonglows, Limelites, Solitaires -- fleeting sounds, silhouettes on the shade, music soon gone, but like Ronnie I's little oasis, somehow still alive.

HEADLINE: A Bachelor's Effort To Understand Love

BYLINE: By JULIE SCELFO

 BODY:
IT was on the island of Saipan, in a remote part of the Pacific Rim, that John Bowe, then a 42-year-old writer researching a book on modern-day slavery, fell madly in love for the first time in his adult life.
 The romance, which began three years ago, could have resulted in an engagement and maybe even marriage. Instead, it was the latest in a series of fraught relationships, all of which seemed destined to end in failure. 
 Mr. Bowe, a perpetual bachelor, had been in love twice before -- in high school and as a graduate student -- but it had been so long and this new feeling was so profound that it shook him to the core. Rather than making him happy, he said, it confused him.
 ''This facet of experience most people center their lives around came as this alien, funny, unanticipated shock to me,'' he said last week, pounding garlic and spices with a mortar and pestle in the kitchen of his West Village studio apartment. He was certain that he was in love, he said, but felt confounded by how to deal with a relationship that ''came with so many complications, and a lot of fear, and a lot of pressure.'' 
 Part of the problem, he said, was the distance involved -- Saipan is a two-day trip from New York -- and the fact that the woman shared custody of her two sons with their father and couldn't leave the island.
 So tormented was Mr. Bowe by his inability to make the relationship work that he set out on a two-year quest to find out why. Not through conventional means, like psychotherapy, but by researching other people's romantic experiences.
 The result is ''Us: Americans Talk About Love,'' a new collection of first-person accounts of why love succeeds or fails, published by Faber & Faber. No aspect of lust, greed, need or devotion is ignored: The book includes tales of obsession and confusion (from a 17-year-old girl in San Antonio, Tex., who can't get over an ex-boyfriend and a drug-addled 30-year-old living with his mother in Arizona while following his ex on Facebook); finding bliss (as a 44-year-old lesbian eventually did in Minneapolis, after more than a decade of marriage to a born-again Christian); and acceptance (from a 76-year-old widower in Manhattan who says he dated more than 300 women after his wife died, without ever finding anyone to take her place). 
 It is as compelling as literary fiction, and the Los Angeles Times Magazine called it a ''profound, touching work.'' But it also functions as a kind of self-help manual, forcing readers to examine their own longings, failings and assumptions about love.
 On the surface, there is little to suggest that Mr. Bowe, who came to New York from Minneapolis in his early 20s ''to be a famous musician or filmmaker,'' isn't the last great catch.
 On a recent afternoon, he was well groomed and neatly dressed in a pressed oxford and jeans, his bright studio equally tidy: an assortment of cookware carefully arrayed on a kitchen wall, records and files stacked neatly under his bed. In the cotton-candy-colored bathroom, there was none of the hair or dust one might expect to see in a bachelor pad. And nearly every wall of his apartment was decorated with paintings of flowers, a collection he has spent more than two decades amassing.
 ''When I was a little punk rocker on a motorcycle when I was 18, I went to thrift stores, and I just noticed how many amateur paintings there are out there of either flowers or Jesus. I thought, 'Wouldn't it be cool to collect all the different ones?' '' he said. ''I realized I didn't want 100 visages of Jesus staring down at me.''
 Mr. Bowe's domestication extends to cooking: even though it was the middle of the day, he had already begun preparing dinner -- a pork dish with a homemade spice mix inspired by a jar of crushed sweet peppers brought back from a recent trip to Portugal. Offering his guest some mint tea, he reached into a cupboard and pulled out a bag full of dried mint leaves that he grew over the summer at a friend's house in Dutchess County.
 His resume would impress any woman with a soft spot for social issues: After graduating from film school at Columbia University and co-writing the movie ''Basquiat,'' he traveled the world for a decade, working as a cowboy in Argentina and as a bargeman on the Amazon River. Along the way, he wrote a series of magazine articles on modern-day slavery -- one of which won a Hillman prize for fostering social and economic justice -- and later published a book called ''Nobodies: Modern American Slave Labor and the Dark Side of the New Global Economy.'' 
 Ask him about his work as a journalist and he holds forth like a modern-day Marxist, railing against injustice and criticizing the mainstream news media for focusing on the ruling class instead of ''regular people.'' 
 ''I don't like experts and authorities, and I don't like writing about stuff in the normal way they consider news,'' he said, explaining his belief that ''noncelebrities'' and ''nonexperts'' do a far better job of illuminating the human condition.
 ''Even thinking you're the most enlightened, objective person in the world, you could never anticipate'' all the points of view you get from ordinary people, he said. ''And they end up being smarter than you could ever be.''
 Despite his profound feeling for the problems of complete strangers, Mr. Bowe doesn't seem to have as much awareness when it comes to the difficulties in his own life. 
 After repeated prodding, he recounted his romantic history, beginning with a high school relationship in which he and a girlfriend broke up and got back together ''1,500 times.'' During one of the separations, he said, he set her up with one of his best friends, which turned out to be an inspired pairing. (The two were still together when he went off to college.) Later, he said, he fell for a ''deeply funny'' film school classmate who was smart and creative. But during the year and a half they dated, they discovered that they were ''awful at resolving problems.''
 In his 30s -- when he alternated between ''long stretches of being alone'' and ''one-night stands or lame affairs,'' he said -- he was focused almost entirely on his career: ''I wanted to put writing first, so I could earn a living doing it. I wanted to make sure I could do what I wanted to do.''
 Once he fell in love with the woman in Saipan, though, he spent two years traveling back and forth while they hatched a plan for her move to New York. Eventually, it became clear that the plan was unrealistic. ''You know that idea that true love conquers all?'' he said. ''It can conquer a hell of a lot, but it can't conquer everything.'' 
 As to why his previous relationships didn't work out, either, he volunteered: ''I can be oblivious. I don't think I'm ever mean or whatever. But I think I can just be thoughtless sometimes. You can't ever be thoughtful enough.'' 
 What would the women he's dated say? 
 ''There's the impotency problem,'' he deadpanned. ''That's a joke.''
 Pouring mint tea into two glasses, he explained that while he has no regrets about his past, he still wants nothing more than to fall in love and start a family. ''At a certain point, one wants it all to stop, and just to settle down and be boring and normal,'' he said. ''And that's absolutely who I've become now. I will be the happiest person on this planet when I have kids. I do think it's a bummer to be playing around with your kids in your 50s as opposed to in your 30s,but that's the way the cookie crumbled.''
 Later, in one of several late-night phone calls when Mr. Bowe seemed less guarded, he speculated about his chances of finding love at this point in his life. ''I think it's a very arrogant gamble I made in a way,'' he said. ''I'll have time to set up a career that fulfills my spiritual goals and then have time for a relationship afterwards. If I'm right, then I'm the coolest guy in the world. If I'm wrong, I'm a loser.'' 
 Over the years, he admitted, friends have accused him of being afraid of intimacy. ''But pretty much all of those friends wanted to be artists or filmmakers or writers, and none of them are,'' he said.
 ''The goal was always to avoid being that surly alcoholic guy who didn't live up to his dreams and blamed the wife and kids for that,'' he added. ''So, you make your calculations, you roll the dice and you hope you're right that there's time after you make it to then join the human race and have a normal emotional life.''

HEADLINE: Newly Public Rusal Slides, Following Markets' Slump

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER and ANDREW E. KRAMER; Andrew E. Kramer reported from Moscow.

DATELINE: HONG KONG 

 BODY:
Shares in Rusal, the aluminum giant controlled by the Russian oligarch Oleg V. Deripaska, plunged nearly 11 percent Wednesday in their trading debut in Hong Kong, weighed down by global markets' recent slump.
 Rusal raised $2.2 billion in the initial public offering last week, making it the largest in many months in Hong Kong. The I.P.O., the first on the exchange this year, is also the first primary listing there for a company from outside Asia. Hong Kong emerged as one of the biggest venues for initial offerings last year, largely reflecting a flurry of listings from Chinese companies.
 A number of Russian companies, particularly those operating near China in Siberia, or selling commodities across the border, are eager to follow Rusal's lead and tap Chinese capital markets. These include the Russian state railroad, which operates the only rail line from the Far East to Europe. 
 Russian companies say they believe that Chinese investors are eager to invest in Russian mines and oil companies but have been reluctant to put money into the sometimes murky Russian stock exchanges. That is attracting to Hong Kong the Russian companies that might previously have sought to list in London or New York. China last year surpassed Germany as Russia's largest trading partner. 
 Rusal, caught up in tortuous debt-restructuring negotiations last year that were among the most extensive in Russian history, eventually was approved for a listing after regulatory hold-ups pushed the timing into 2010.
 A number of prominent investors, including the New York hedge fund manager Paulson & Company and Nathaniel Rothschild, the European banking family heir, bought into the offering. But concerns about Rusal's $14.9 billion debt and other risks prompted the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission to limit the company's share purchases to batches starting at a million Hong Kong dollars ($129,000) to discourage small investors from the offering.
 Rusal shares finished their first day of trading at 9.66 Hong Kong dollars, 1.14 dollars below the I.P.O. price of 10.80. Mr. Deripaska said the performance was reasonable in light of recent global market declines, Reuters reported.
 The overall Hong Kong market had a sixth successive session of declines Wednesday; the Hang Seng index fell 0.4 percent.
 The Rusal I.P.O. price was set Friday before mining and metals shares swooned globally, said Mark Rubinstein, a deputy chief analyst at Metropol in Moscow, and by the time the stock started trading the drop was expected. 
 It should not weigh against the broader strategy of Russian companies trying to sell their shares in Hong Kong, he said. 
 ''That it was placed successfully, that is important,'' he said. ''If it moves in line with the market, that is all it needs to do.''
 Russian Railways, the world's largest railway company and the operator of the Trans-Siberian Railway connecting Asia to Europe, is considering taking two subsidiaries public and could list in Hong Kong, an adviser to the company has said. 
 Ilyushin Finance, an aircraft leasing company partly owned by the Russian financier Aleksandr Y. Lebedev, is also considering listing in Hong Kong to raise about $200 million, according to a spokesman. 
 ''Clearly, there's a trend of Russians discovering Asia,'' Dimitry Afanasiev, chairman of Egorov Puginsky Afanasiev & Partners, who negotiated the listing in Hong Kong, said Wednesday.
 In mainland China, the Shanghai composite index dropped 1.1 percent, dragged down by continued nervousness about the Chinese authorities' efforts to rein in bank lending in a bid to quash inflation.
 Those concerns -- combined with worries about President Obama's plans for tighter restrictions on banks -- have helped drag down stocks around the world for days.
 ''The last couple of weeks have thrown up prospects of U.S.-led banking regulation and simmering sovereign credit concerns. Neither directly challenges the strong domestic fundamentals of Asian economies, though Asia of course cannot escape the fact of its export leverage to developed economies, nor of the state of global liquidity in so far as it impacts portfolio flows,'' Patrick Bennett, a strategist at Societe Generale in Hong Kong, wrote in a note on Wednesday. ''While there is uncertainty, we must expect some defensive positioning in Asian markets.''
