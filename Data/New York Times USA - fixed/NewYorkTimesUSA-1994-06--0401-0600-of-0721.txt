HEADLINE: U.S. Juries Grow Tougher On Those Seeking Damages

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

 BODY:
In this land of big lawsuits, the growth of multimillion-dollar jury awards has been halted: juries nationwide have become markedly tougher on people who sue doctors, insurance companies and other deep-pockets defendants, siding less often with plaintiffs. And there is evidence that the size of the awards has leveled off, too.
In 1992, plaintiffs won 52 percent of the personal injury cases decided by jury verdicts, down from 63 percent in 1989, according to Jury Verdict Research, a legal publishing firm in Horsham, Pa., that is the only one nationally to compile such data. And there are indications that the downward trend continued last year. 
 The firm's research also indicates that despite the occasional colossal award that generates great publicity and revives assertions that juries have run amok, the average award has remained constant during the 1990's.
Theories abound as to why the shift has occurred, but the most widely accepted seems to be that criticism leveled at juries and their perceived largesse by two of the most affluent defendants -- the medical profession and the insurance industry -- has sunk in.
"There's been such a campaign by the insurance industry, by people like Dan Quayle, saying these big awards are killing our society," said Brian Shenker, editorial director of Jury Verdict Research. "People see this in the media, and when they get on juries they think, 'I'm not going to contribute to this.' "
James F. McHugh, an associate justice of the Massachusetts Superior Court, said, "There's less of a sense among juries that it's other people's money we're dealing with." Jurors, he added, "are aware that we all pay these costs" in the form of insurance premiums.
The acid test of this attitude, lawyers and judges say, is in personal injury cases, in which individual plaintiffs are often pitted against corporate defendants and, almost invariably, against the defendants' insurance companies. By contrast, practitioners say, jurors' attitudes have not changed in cases of contract disputes or fraud suits, for example, that tend to pit one company against another.
Some lawyers, like Stephan Peskin, president of the New York State Trial Lawyers Association, say they have seen no evidence of greater jury skepticism regarding plaintiffs' claims. "Jurors still do what's right," he said. "I think the insurance industry message is being filtered through some very observant eyes."
But the numbers point to a determined shift. From 1961 to 1991, a plaintiff's chances of prevailing at trial in personal injury suits changed remarkably little, never rising above 63 percent or falling below 57 percent in any year. Then came the drop to 52 percent in 1992.
"I've seen a kind of conservatism among jurors, and you get defendants' verdicts that you might not have a few years ago," said Justice Helen E. Freedman of New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan. "Jurors say they're very concerned about the high verdicts you read about in the newspaper -- though they don't ever hear about the verdicts for the defendant -- and they're very concerned about the high costs of health care and insurance."
Stephen H. Mackauf, chairman of the medical malpractice committee of the New York County Lawyers Association, said, "Now when I question jurors, I find they come in with strong negative opinions about lawsuits, where they didn't used to."
Mr. Mackauf, a partner at Gair, Gair, Conason, Steigman & Mackauf, and other trial lawyers said the change is most noticeable among middle-class jurors, many of whom pay health insurance premiums and are aware of rising medical costs and jury verdicts.
 
Offended by TV Ads
 Michael Mone, president of the Massachusetts Bar Association, said that television advertisements for personal injury lawyers may have enhanced the trend.
"I think jurors are offended by some of that advertising," he said. "It makes them tend to look askance at the cases that are in front of them."
Several trial lawyers also suggested that people who were hit hard by the recession might have become less sympathetic to personal injury plaintiffs.
But people in the legal profession agree that the shift in jury sentiments is not the result of an increase in frivolous lawsuits.
"In medical malpractice, if anything, the quality of cases has gotten better," said Justice Freedman, who has tried numerous medical malpractice and products liability cases. "Plaintiffs know that these cases are very costly and time-consuming, and I think they've become more reluctant" to sue.
G. Marc Whitehead, a Minneapolis trial lawyer who was co-chairman of a Brookings Institution conference in 1992 on the future of the civil jury, said the sense among lawyers "is that litigation is actually down overall," and added, "People find it's too expensive, slow and difficult."
As has long been the case, jury awards average slightly more when government agencies are the defendants, but the size of that gap has not changed in recent years.
Jury Verdict Research's figures show an especially stark shift in juries' sympathies in cases involving premises liability and medical malpractice, which in recent years have accounted for 25 percent of all personal injury trials. Premises liability, including slip-and-fall cases, is invoked when someone is injured on someone else's property.
 
Plaintiffs Losing Ground
 A plaintiff's chances of winning a premises liability trial fell to 42 percent in 1992 from 65 percent in 1987. In medical malpractice cases, which involve some of the largest awards, the winning rate dropped to 31 percent in 1992 from 48 percent in 1989.
All the data for 1993 have not yet been compiled, but there is no sign that plaintiffs gained ground over the previous year, Mr. Shenker said.
In products liability, the one major area for which 1993 figures are available, he said, a plaintiff's chances of winning at trial, having dropped to 43 percent in 1992 from 59 percent in 1989, slipped to 41 percent last year.
It is harder to draw conclusions from the size of damage awards, which vary broadly. Categorizing all personal injury awards by amount -- for example, under $50,000, $200,000 to $400,000 and more than $1 million -- the Jury Verdict figures show virtually no change in recent years.
A look at both the median and average size of products liability awards shows a similar constancy from 1988 to 1992. The median medical malpractice award -- $350,000 in 1992 -- showed no consistent pattern. The average, which can be greatly increased by a few large verdicts and so fluctuates more wildly than the median, rose from an average of about $1.1 million in the late 1980's to about $1.7 million in the early 1990's.

HEADLINE: Clinton May Add G.I.'s in Korea While Remaining Open to Talks

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 16

 BODY:
President Clinton met with top advisers today to consider Pentagon recommendations to bolster American forces in South Korea, but he later held out the possibility that a new diplomatic offer by North Korea might lead to a resolution of the crisis over the North's suspected nuclear weapons program.
At a news conference after a day of meetings, Mr. Clinton said his Administration would be willing to participate in high-level talks with the North Koreans if they agreed to freeze their nuclear weapons program. 
 Mr. Clinton made his offer after President Kim Il Sung told former President Jimmy Carter today in Pyongyang that North Korea was willing to allow international inspectors to continue work at a nuclear site at Yongbyon and wanted to discuss replacing its plutonium-producing complex with technology that yields less bomb-grade material. [Page A10.]
"If today's developments mean that North Korea is genuinely and verifiably prepared to freeze its nuclear program while talks go on, and we hope that is the case, then we would be willing to resume high-level talks," Mr. Clinton said. "In the meantime, we will pursue our consultations on sanctions."
While officials insisted that Washington had not changed its goals, Mr. Clinton's statement contained an important policy shift.
Previously, the Administration had insisted that it would not resume high-level talks with North Korea unless the North suspended efforts to develop nuclear weapons. Washington also insisted that the North make it possible to determine in the future whether it had ever diverted plutonium, a fissionable byproduct of the Yongbyon generator.
Administration officials defended Mr. Clinton's decision to drop the precondition on tracing past diversions of plutonium, saying that North Korea's new diplomacy hinted at flexibility and that this issue could be taken up later at high-level talks.
North Korea has alrady destroyed some evidence of its past diversion by rapidly removing spent fuel rods from the Yongbyon reactor without supervision.
"You can't go off and pout in a corner and say, now that they have done things we did not want them to do, there is no solution," a senior Administration official said. "It is incumbent on the North Koreans to do something to restore the basis for a dialogue, and we will wait and see whether they have done that."
Mr. Clinton made his offer after meeting with his top aides, including Defense Secretary William J. Perry and Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to discuss the Defense Department's recommendations.
Officials said Mr. Perry had offered Mr. Clinton a three-tiered plan, calibrating the options on military force to different levels of international sanctions against North Korea, the North's behavior and other indicators of the risk of war.
 
The Stages of Involvement
 Mr. Perry did not endorse a specific option, but sees some reinforcement as necessary to deter North Korea from launching an attack if sanctions are imposed, Pentagon officials said.
At the low end is the deployment of mostly support personnel to ease the dispatch of reinforcements in the event of a North Korean attack.
Under another option, the United States would send 30 to 40 aircraft to the region, including F-117 Stealth fighter-bombers and long-range bombers. Tactical fighters would be stationed in Korea; the bombers might be based in Guam. Two aircraft carriers would be stationed in the region, instead of the single carrier that is routinely kept there. The Army and the Marines would also strengthen their forces.
Administration officials said the recommendations reflected the views of Gen. Gary E. Luck, the United States commander in Korea.
 
A Decision Within Days
 Administration officials said a decision on reinforcements was possible in the next several days. But the White House has to weigh a number of considerations.
General Luck has told Congress that he would need 400,000 troops to supplement the 37,000 in South Korea if there were a second Korean war, and that it would take up to 60 days to deploy them. So if the Administration wants to deter the North Koreans from attacking, it has to begin taking steps now.
But by taking steps to strengthen its forces, the Administration risks provoking the North Koreans or giving them an excuse to scuttle their diplomatic efforts.
 
Seeking Help on Sanctions
 Mr. Perry's view is that since it is difficult to determine exactly what might prove provocative, Washington should emphasize not how North Korea might react, but on the steps needed to protect American forces, officials said.
Another concern for Washington is its effort to mobilize support for economic sanctions if the diplomatic efforts fall short.
The Russian Foreign Minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev, complained today that Moscow had not been consulted adequately about the draft resolution seeking United Nations sanctions.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher spoke with Mr. Kozyrev this morning and plans to meet with him to assuage the Russian concerns, an Administration official said.
 
Reinforcements Backed
 Reflecting concern over North Korea's threats, the Senate approved today, 93 to 3, a measure urging the Administration to immediately strengthen United States forces in South Korea "to deter and if necessary repel an attack from North Korea."
But with the risks of war, and with the prospects for winning Security Council support for sanctions uncertain, the Administration is stressing the diplomatic approach.
Indications that North Korea is prepared for a diplomatic accommodation came when former President Carter reported on his talks in Pyongyang.
The North Korean leaders told Mr. Carter that monitors from the International Atomic Energy Agency could stay at the Yongbyon site as long as Washington made "good faith efforts" to end the dispute.
The North Koreans also repeated a long-standing offer to scrap some reactors that are useful in producing plutonium if the United States and other countries would provide billions of dollars to help the North to build light-water reactors that use more modern technology, presumably solely for energy use.
 
Conditions on Diplomacy
 Administation officials said that for diplomacy to be successful, North Korea would have to permit monitoring of the spent fuel they recently removed from the Yongbyon reactor, refrain from reprocessing new plutonium and agree not to refuel the reactor. They would not be expected to stop work on a second reactor or on expanding their plutonium reprocessing.
But top Administration officials acknowledged that the North Korean position needed to be clarified. "It depends on what the Koreans actually meant by what they said today," Mr. Clinton said. "There is a great deal at stake."
Mr. Clinton's news conference seemed to be intended not only to send a message to the North Koreans, but to rebut criticism that the President is detached and vacillating on foreign policy.
But when asked directly about the military situation on the Korean peninsula, Mr. Clinton sidestepped the issue of whether additional forces were needed. "We will take appropriate steps, as we should, as we must. So there's nothing to be concerned about."

HEADLINE: G.O.P. IN THE HOUSE IS TRYING TO BLOCK HEALTH CARE BILL

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 16

 BODY:
At the urging of Representative Newt Gingrich, their deputy leader, House Republicans are trying to keep health care legislation from reaching the floor in a form that could pass.
Despite criticism from Democrats and even from one Republican who accused him of putting partisan politics first, Mr. Gingrish said today that Republicans should vote against amendments that might broaden the support for a bill that the House Ways and Means Committee is considering. 
 A few hours later, Republican committee members followed that prescription; all 14 opposed an amendment to soften the bill's impact on small businesses by providing tax credits to offset their new insurance costs.
But Mr. Gingrich's hardball strategy backfired when previously divided Democrats closed ranks and voted unanimously for a series of amendments, even though some made clear that they did not like them and might alter some later. Several said Mr. Gingrich's move had unified them.
Mr. Gingrich's comments confirmed in part accusations of obstructionism that Democrats had leveled at Republican leaders, saying they were muzzling moderates in their party and blocking compromise on any health care bill. But the Democrats had never provided specifics.
"It's becoming clearer and clearer that they are interested in frustrating action," Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader, said today. Although Republicans have often said they desired bipartisan cooperation, he said, "their real intention is to, unfortunately, not do anything." He said Republicans were acting like "robots."
In an interview today, Mr. Gingrich, of Georgia, responded, "I think it is very sad to see Gephardt reduced to a Clinton level of dishonesty." He said that Republicans had repeatedly offered to work with Democrats on health care legislation but that "what they mean by bipartisan is us caving in." He said members of his party were resisting "selling out your principles to pass one bill."
Mr. Gingrich said he had told Republican members of the Ways and Means Committee that "they should do what they think is effective in minimizing the prospect that the Gibbons bill will pass." The committee's bill was proposed by its acting chairman, Representative Sam M. Gibbons of Florida.
The Gibbons bill would seek to provide health insurance for all Americans by requiring employers to pay most of the cost of premiums for their workers and by creating a new form of Medicare, the existing health program for the elderly, to include the unemployed and others not reached through employment.
"There is no point in improving it so it will pass," Mr. Gingrich said. "It's a bad bill, and it's wrong." He said the bill would cause "bigger government, bigger bureaucracy and higher taxes for worse health care."
Mr. Gingrich, who is all but certain to become minority leader after the November elections, confirmed a complaint made on Wednesday by Representative Fred Grandy, Republican of Iowa. In a meeting of the committee, Mr. Grandy said Mr. Gingrich had urged that an amendment suggested by Mr. Grandy not be offered because the taxes it involved might be used as an issue against Republican candidates.
Mr. Grandy agreed not to propose the amendment in the committee meeting, but he said today, "To see health care pre-empted by politics, even in the short run, is unsettling."
Senators have not made similar complaints in public. But if they are guaranteed anonymity, some senators of both parties say Presidential politics and a desire to deny Mr. Clinton success have driven Republicans to oppose compromising on health care.
Others insist that they merely feel very strongly that Mr. Clinton's proposal for national health insurance and the spinoffs offered by Mr. Gibbons and Senators Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York would be bad for the country. They usually focus on the damage to small business they foresee if employers are required to buy insurance for their workers, an element these bills have in common.
 
Unity Above All
 But at least one important player, Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon, cited Republican unity as a reason for going against his own preference. Mr. Packwood, the senior Republican on Mr. Moynihan's Finance Committee, said today that while he personally favored an employer mandate, for example, he would not vote for one.
"If you're going to go against your party, you do it either out of conscience or constituency," he said. "You do not do it over a matter of convenience." He said that he thought requiring contributions from employers would enable the nation to insure all Americans but that it could be done, though more slowly, without that requirement. Republican unity is worth a little delay, he said.
A group of Democrats held a news conference today to try to rally support for Mr. Clinton's call for universal insurance coverage and required employer payments to achieve it. Mr. Kennedy, chairman of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, said he was confident the full Senate would support employer payments once it had debated the issue, because "you don't get to universal coverage without an employer contribution."
The Senate Democratic leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine, told reporters this morning, "We will be on the Senate floor with a health care bill in July." He said he was not dismayed by the disagreements that had stalled action in the Finance Committee. "I've been through dozens and dozens of bills where you start with disagreement and end up with agreement," he said.
The embattled Finance Committee held two closed meetings today, discussing what benefits should be included under any national health insurance plan. It also discussed what sort of national board should deal with changes in the package. The committee will meet, again in a closed meeting, next Tuesday.
 
Grandy Would Tax Benefits
 The Grandy amendment that started the House dispute is actually one that Democratic leaders like Mr. Gephardt oppose bitterly, though some members of both parties like the idea. It would tax health care benefits above those in a minimum insurance plan, both to discourage wasteful use of health care resources and to raise money to subsidize insurance for the poor. Labor unions have made the defeat of any version of this idea a top priority.
Mr. Gingrich told Mr. Grandy that his amendment could hurt Republican candidates, because Democrats could label it a tax increase on the middle class. Mr. Grandy said he understood, though he was disappointed.
This afternoon the Ways and Means Committee's Democrats, who were bickering last night over a patchwork series of amendments that would reduce proposed tobacco taxes, give tax credits to small businesses and delay the availability of long-term-care benefits, stood together and voted without dissent for each of them.
In a caucus this morning, Democrats encouraged one another to stand against the Republican enemy.
Mr. Gingrich's title is Republican whip, which means it is the Republicans whom he is supposed to keep united. But Representative Jim McDermott, a Washington Democrat who swallowed his unhappiness with details of the amendments and voted for them, said Democratic antagonism toward the Republican leader meant that "Mr. Gingrich was our whip today."

HEADLINE: Moscow Is Miffed by U.S. Draft on Sanctions

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, June 16

 BODY:
Complaining that Washington has again neglected to consult adequately with Moscow on a vital issue of international security, Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev refused today to support a Security Council resolution drafted by the United States that would impose sanctions on North Korea.
It was the second time this week that Mr. Kozyrev had lashed out at the United States. On Tuesday, he warned Congress that its vote to end the arms embargo against the Bosnian Government could ignite "a new world war." 
 The statements underscore increasing strains as Russia tries to reconcile its new relationship to the United States with surging anti-Western politics at home.
 
Russia's View of Russia
 Russia wants to continue to play a major role in world politics. It wants to be a full partner in NATO, to mediate the war in Bosnia and to dispatch troops to the increasingly troubled former Soviet republics. It feels it should share responsibility with the United States for policing the spread of nuclear weapons.
Yet when Russian leaders appear to follow Washington's lead in international diplomacy, angry domestic opponents rise up to denounce them.
This has increasingly put Mr. Kozyrev and his colleagues in the hot seat. Today he declined to say flatly that his Government would veto the resolution. But, addressing himself more to a perceived lack of communication than to the decision itself, he warned that a veto was possible.
"I think presenting the draft unilaterally will seriously complicate Russian consideration of the document," Mr. Kozyrev told reporters. "In any case, we will not support a set of sanctions worked out without our cooperation."
 
Missed Signals Over Bombing
 Moscow also protested loudly last March when NATO planes bombed Bosnian Serb positions without specifically notifying Russia ahead of time. Bewildered officials in Washington responded that Moscow had given its general consent to such a military response, and therefore should not have been surprised.
After that misunderstanding, American diplomats devoted considerable energy to calming Moscow's nerves, but they also noted that given nationalist sentiment in Russia and its ethnic ties to the Bosnian Serbs, it suited Moscow to seem indignant.
Similarly, it was not clear how much Mr. Kosyrev's statement today was driven by internal politics and how much by genuine anger.
Whatever its causes, the increased tension is not likely to help discussions over Russia's role in a new loose alliance that offers a kind of junior partnership in NATO to members of the former Warsaw Pact.
 
Talks About Talks With NATO
 Last week, after many delays and complaints about Russia's status with NATO, President Boris N. Yeltsin said he would sign the agreement, and on Wednesday NATO urged Russia to begin immediate talks in Brussels to improve relations. Russian officials said they would probably accept the invitation, and Mr. Kozyrev said today that he would go to Brussels next week.
Moscow does not have a close relationship with North Korea, but it is nevertheless reluctant to surrender whatever influence it still has there. In Soviet times, Moscow helped develop North Korea's nuclear industry, and Russia still nurtures commercial and diplomatic ties.
Thus Moscow has been reluctant to go along with the United States, South Korea and Japan in seeking United Nations sanctions to press North Korea to allow full United Nations inspection of its nuclear installations.
Mr. Kozyrev said that in a telephone conversation with Secretary of State Warren Christopher, he had been assured that Washington would not move unilaterally on sanctions, but would consider Moscow's proposal to hold an international conference on North Korea's nuclear build-up. Moscow had said that if North Korea were found to be in violation of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, it would consider sanctions as a last resort.
For now, Moscow proposed an international conference that would seek to ban nuclear weapons from both North and South Korea. While the Russian Government has always shown a predeliction for such conferences -- it proposed a similar one to resolve the Mideast conflict -- Washington views them with disfavor.
Mr. Kozyrev is to appear before the lower house of Parliament on Friday to explain the Government's position on North Korea.
However unwelcome in Washington, his harsh warning against sanctions can only please many members of Parliament, who have increasingly accused Mr. Yeltsin's Government of being too compliant to the United States.

HEADLINE: Yellowstone Will Shelter Wolves Again

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DENVER, June 16

 BODY:
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt has given final approval to a plan to reintroduce about 30 gray wolves into Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho, a decision that is being hailed by some environmentalist groups as a victory for wildlife but is being denounced by ranchers who fear for their livestock.
Other groups, like the Sierra Club, have expressed disappointment with the policy, which does not give the wolves protection as an endangered species even though wolves elsewhere have that protection. 
 Like the debate over grazing fees and hard-rock mining on public lands, the wolf issue pits the New West against the Old West, urban values versus rural: on one side are people who see the wilderness as a place mostly for recreation, and on the other side are people who see it as an economic resource.
The plan, which was given final approval on Wednesday, aims to restore the wildlife balance in the northern Rocky Mountains, where wolves thrived until the 1920's, when they were killed off by ranchers. Wildlife biologists say a shortage of predators has resulted in a population explosion for elk and deer, which are damaging the grasses.
 
Canadian Imports
 Under the plan, the wolves will be removed from Canada and reintroduced into Wyoming and Idaho as soon as December. There have been sightings of wolves in Yellowstone recently, as well as in northern Montana. Perhaps the largest number of wolves live in northern Minnesota.
While 30 wolves will be reintroduced initially, the aim is to have at least 100 wolves at each location by the year 2002, The Associated Press reported. About 60 wolves have already been found in northwestern Montana; they have migrated from Canada. Under the Government's plan, that wolf population will also be increased.
Roger Schlickeisen, the president of Defenders of Wildlife, a Washington group, hailed the move as "a turning point in the annals of wildlife conservation."
But Betsy Buffington, a spokeswoman for the Sierra Club, said that while the move was "a step in the right direction," the Clinton Administration had gone too far in its efforts to appease Western farmers and ranchers.
"The Administration was a little too eager to compromise," she said. "This action reduces the protection for wolves."
Michael Robinson, a spokesman for Sinapu, a group in Boulder, Colo., that pushes for the reintroduction of wolves, also criticized the plan for giving ranchers too much leeway in managing the predators.
 
Killing Will Be Allowed
 Under the plan, a wolf can be killed if it is found attacking livestock on private land. The plan also allows ranchers to harass, but not injure, wolves found in their grazing areas, officials said.
Ranchers fear that the wolves will multiply and attack lambs, calves and even pets. "We spend a lot of time and money to protect our lambs from predators: mountain lions, coyotes," said Julie Hansmire, who, with her husband, Randy Campbell, raises 4,000 head of Rambouillet sheep in western Colorado. "And now there's one more."
She said urban people had a "warm and fuzzy feeling" about wolves but had never walked into a pasture to see a lamb with its nose chewed off or its throat cut.
Wildlife advocates, on the other hand, say the losses will cause only slight losses of livestock. Wolves have suffered because of misconceptions about their viciousness, they say.
"A wolf will occasionally chew on a lamb or calf," said Mr. Schlickeisen. "But the numbers are very small."
He also said misconceptions came from legends about wicked wolves, as in "Aesop's Fables" and "Little Red Riding Hood." He said, "There is not a single recorded case of a healthy wolf attacking a healthy human in all of North America."
But Mr. Schlickeisen defended the decision not to include the endangered-species designation in the Government's plan as a way to make it more palatable to ranchers. "I suppose this could have been just rammed down their throats," he said. "But all that would have done is created a lot of anger."
He added: "Our perspective is this: The objective was to get a viable population of wolves into the Yellowstone ecosystem as quickly as possible. And that's going to be done."
The group has raised about $100,000 to compensate ranchers for losses to predators like wolves.
The wolves will wear collars so they can be monitored. They will initially be enclosed in pens, so they can become accustomed to their new surroundings.

HEADLINE: A Health Care Finance Plan: Ingenious, or Impenetrable?

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 16

 BODY:
To finance universal health insurance without additional income or payroll taxes, the new head of the House Ways and Means Committee has devised a method of raising money so complex and intricate that few members of Congress have been able to explain it.
Supporters of the proposal describe it as an ingenious way to raise money from companies that, they say, are evading their social responsibility to contribute to the cost of health care. Critics say the proposal is just a hidden tax, and a big one. 
 Under the proposal, offered by the acting chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, Representative Sam M. Gibbons, Democrat of Florida, all employers would have to contribute to the cost of insurance for their workers. In a two-career family, these contributions would amount to somewhat more than needed for the family's coverage. The Government would then "skim" the excess to help finance health care for people who are poor, unemployed or uninsured.
Congressional analysts said this would raise $118 billion for the Government from 1998 to 2002.
 
Balancing Act
 The proposal is meant to balance the concerns of big companies and small businesses. Nonetheless, both are denouncing it.
Under current law, private employers are not required to provide health insurance to their workers, though most do. President Clinton, and most Democrats in Congress, wants to require all employers to help buy insurance for their workers, a concept called the employer mandate.
Under Mr. Gibbons's proposal, all employers would have to offer coverage. When a husband and a wife worked for different companies, the family would enroll in the plan offered by one employer, who would be designated as the enrolling employer. That company would pay 80 percent of the "family premium," estimated at $4,785 a year.
The other company would pay 80 percent of the individual premium of $2,140, though it would provide no direct health benefits to the family. This payment would be collected by the Government and distributed to the enrolling employer to help offset the cost of covering an employee's spouse who worked elsewhere.
 
Declining Need
 But the Federal Government would retain some of the money, or skim it, in the phrase widely used on Capitol Hill. In 1998 and 1999, the Government would keep 75 percent of all the money collected; it would distribute 25 percent to the enrolling employers. The Government would retain 60 percent of the money in the year 2000 and 40 percent in 2001.
After that, the Government would, in theory, distribute all the money to employers. By 2002, supporters of the proposal say, the Government would no longer need this money to subsidize coverage for the poor and uninsured because health costs would have been controlled.
But Frank B. McArdle, manager of the Washington research office of Hewitt Associates, a consulting firm that specializes in benefits, said, "Many people doubt that this provision would ever cease, especially if it turns out that health care reform is underfinanced."
 
Getting a Free Ride
 Big companies usually provide more generous fringe benefits than do small companies. If one spouse works for a big company and the other for a small company, the family often gets its health insurance from the big company. The small company may get a free ride, paying little or nothing. Even when a small business provides coverage to its workers, it often pays nothing toward coverage of children and spouses.
Big companies and President Clinton say small businesses should pay their "fair share." But Representative Benjamin L. Cardin, a Maryland Democrat who is on the Ways and Means Committee, said he saw no need to make employers buy health insurance for workers who already had coverage through spouses.
"I wanted to continue the free ride as a break for small business," Mr. Cardin said. "But I ran up against a brick wall from legislators who are very interested in trying to help large industrial companies."
So Mr. Cardin came up with a compromise, now incorporated in Mr. Gibbons's proposal. Under that plan, Mr. Cardin said, if a husband chose to get coverage through his wife's health plan, the husband's employer would have to pay something, but it would be substantially less than the cost of full family coverage.
And rather than give "a windfall" to companies that now provide such family coverage, Mr. Cardin said, the Government should keep some of the money and put it into a trust fund for a new Part C of Medicare, available to poor people and the uninsured.
 
'Worse Than Clinton's Plan'
 James A. Klein, the executive director of the Association of Private Pension and Welfare Plans, a trade group composed mainly of Fortune 500 companies, is skeptical. "This is nothing more than a grab by the Federal Treasury of money that's intended to help equalize the cost of providing health insurance coverage," he said. It's highly unlikely that the Government would ever relinquish such an enormous stream of revenue."
Small-business lobbies are equally dissatisfied. "The Gibbons plan is worse than Clinton's plan," said Kim F. McKernan, a lobbyist for the National Federation of Independent Business. "It provides less assistance for small firms than the President did. The employer-mandate scheme in the Gibbons bill operates just like a payroll tax. Its devastating, a real job killer."
Dallas L. Salisbury, the president of the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a private nonpartisan group, said: "The Ways and Means Committee plan has far less semblance of equity than the Clinton proposal. It would be extraordinarily complex to administer, compared with simply having employers pay a tax."

HEADLINE: A.M.A. Tries New Math to Fight Image of Dollar-Gouging Doctors

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, June 16

 BODY:
Tired of watching its members portrayed as patient-gouging money machines, the American Medical Association is changing the way it calculates doctors' median incomes.
The association, which last year stopped issuing annual press releases about doctors' median incomes, decided this week that in the future it would lump the salaries of private practitioners with those of Federal Government doctors and young doctors in training, who make considerably less. 
 Dr. Nancy W. Dickey, the association's secretary-treasurer, said that historically when the group released its annual calculations of doctors' incomes, "the press leaves out the footnotes" explaining which doctors are included and excluded.
"Therefore our only choice is to make a change so the numbers show the whole picture," Dr. Dickey said. "Now the physician looks less like he's gouging America."
 
$253,300 for Radiologists
 The latest calculations, based on 1992 data, show that the mean income of American doctors in private practice is $177,400 a year, ranging from $111,800 for general practitioners to $253,300 for radiologists.
In contrast, doctors in training earn only $22,000 to $30,000 a year. The medical group has not previously collected information on the incomes of Government doctors, but they are known to earn much less than doctors in private practice.
The association adopted the accounting change at its annual meeting, which ended on Thursday. The first reports reflecting the change are expected in two or three years.
Dr. Dickey argued that the current figures reflected only doctors' prime earning years. Only after spending 3 to 10 years as residents in training, working 80 to 100 hours a week, can their incomes soar, she said, and often only in return for 60-hour weeks.
But Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of Public Citizen's Health Research Group in Washington, called the accounting change "unabashed deception."
"It sounds like the kind of snake oil that the A.M.A. is very fond of criticizing others for," Dr. Wolfe said. "The A.M.A. is, at the bottom of it, a trade association representing the economic interests of doctors. The more moves the A.M.A. makes like this, the more they earn the scorn of people in this country."

I.B.M. Forms Networking Division

BYLINE: By PETER H. LEWIS 

 BODY:
I.B.M. said yesterday that it had formed a new division to develop applications and services for both business and consumer computer networks.
The new division, which will be called Networked Application Services, brings together many of I.B.M.'s existing development projects in such varied realms as multimedia, electronic trading, Internet services, video teleconferencing, software for use by networked groups, interactive information kiosks and electronic publishing. 
 It also signals the International Business Machines Corporation's intent to take a more aggressive role in providing not just the technical infrastructure of the so-called information superhighway, but also in developing core products and software services that the network will carry.
 
Gerstner Goals Seen
 "This is probably one of the most important things I.B.M. is going to do this year," said Mark Stahlman, president of New Media Research in New York. "It gives a hint of what Gerstner's new I.B.M. might look like," he added, referring to the company's chairman, Louis Gerstner.
John B. Jones Jr., vice president of equity research for Saloman Brothers Inc. in San Francisco, agreed. "It's clearly a high-profile business opportunity with great growth possibilities," he said.
Fernand B. Sarrat was named general manager of the new division, which will have headquarters in Thornwood, N.Y. In a telephone interview yesterday, Mr. Sarrat said the division would intitially have at least five self-contained operating units and several hundred employees culled from other I.B.M. operations. He said more units would be announced as soon as general managers were selected.
 
Budget 'Not Insignificant'
 Mr. Sarrat declined to disclose the new division's operating budget, saying only that it was "not insignificant."
Asked for examples of the types of products that the Networked Application Services division would offer, Mr. Sarrat rattled off a broad and varied list.
"In the public access kiosk business, we're developing a system for state governments where you could go register yourself for unemployment, or use the kiosk for motor vehicle registration instead of standing in a queue," Mr. Sarrat said. "We're working with Blockbuster to download audio and video into stores."
Mr. Sarrat, a veteran I.B.M. manager who has been working on the network services task force for a year and a half, said other services included collaborative software that would allow, for example, doctors in remote areas to consult with voice, data and illustrations as they looked at a shared image of an X-ray.
I.B.M. announced the new division late yesterday. Its stock closed at $62.875, down 75 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Consumers Put a Brake on Economic Expansion

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 16

 BODY:
America's consumers are starting to cut back their spending, slowing the rate of the economy's expansion.
The drop in consumer spending, economists say, is the result of higher interest rates, declining savings and the evaporation of pent-up demand as families have splurged on cars and other goods over the last year. 
 The Federal Reserve has contributed to the drop with its four increases this year in short-term interest rates, which have pushed up mortgage and other borrowing rates. This has put an end to windfalls for homeowners who had been taking advantage of low interest rates late last year and early this year to refinance their mortgages. The slowdown in spending increases comes after a year in which the growth in consumer spending outstripped the growth in income.
 
 
Big-Ticket Items
 Weakening consumer spending on big-ticket purchases like cars and household appliances is already beginning to hurt some sectors of the economy, although no one is predicting a recession.
At the 45-employee Hiwasse Manufacturing Company in Jacksonville, Ark., for example, overtime has suddenly disappeared. Just two months ago, Hiwasse put everyone on overtime and and hired five new workers, but still accumulated an eight-week backlog of orders for brand name plates that manufacturers like Maytag put on washing machines and dryers. Now, that backlog has shrunk to four weeks, and management is beginning to worry.
"We're talking current events here -- things have kind of taken a nose dive in the last two weeks," said J. Richard Derickson, the president and chief executive of Hiwasse.
Weak sales can be traced to people like Edward J. Manus, a 44-year-old former factory production supervisor in Stratford, Conn. Although Mr. Manus recently found work as a teacher after two factories closed and put him out of work, he is still trying to rebuild his savings and decided last month not to buy a new $189 outdoor barbecue grill.
"I took the one I had apart and fixed it," he said.
Recent Government data showing falling retail sales in April and May, a drop in overall personal consumption spending in April, a slight rise in business inventories in April and a yearlong fall in household savings rates are also reflecting the erosion in consumer spending.
As a result, some economists are trimming slightly their estimates of economic growth for the rest of the year. A survey of corporate economists earlier this month, before the Government released statistics providing some of the strongest evidence of slackening consumer spending, found that the consensus estimate for economic growth in the fourth quarter of this year had dropped by a tenth of a percentage point, to an annual pace of 2.8 percent.
The change was significant not because of its size but because of the direction of the revision, said Robert J. Eggert, who conducted the survey for Blue Chip Economic Indicators, a newsletter in Sedona, Ariz. The fear that sparked inflationary concerns in both financial markets and at the Federal Reserve was that economic growth would continue at the much faster pace of the last half of last year, when the economy grew at a 5 percent rate.
 Economic growth of 3 percent is still not bad, said Alan Blinder, a member of the White House Council of Economic Advisers whom President Clinton recently nominated to become the next vice chairman of the Federal Reserve. "The economy is moving uphill at a steady but not torrid pace," he said.
The new evidence of slowing -- if it continues -- could finally begin to reassure Wall Street and the Federal Reserve that the economy will not overheat, feeding inflation. That new confidence could send the stock market higher and long-term interest rates lower.
The economic indicators also suggest that there will be little pressure for immediate further interest rate increases by the Fed. "The growth of activity is downshifting to a more sustainable pace after the more rapid pace that we had at the end of last year," Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said in an interview. "I don't see any pressure on the Fed to increase those rates."
That sustainable pace is supported by other sectors of the economy -- like business spending on new factory equipment -- that are still doing well, suggesting that any drop in growth will not be dramatic. The housing industry is also holding up well despite higher interest rates, with the Commerce Department announcing today that housing starts rose 2.6 percent in May.
 
 
Impact on Jobs
 But slower growth may also be bad news for Main Street, meaning fewer jobs available in the coming months for the nation's eight million unemployed. Slower spending could mean that goods pile up in manufacturers' warehouses and car dealerships begin looking less bare -- and that could prompt factories and other businesses to slow a little.
Consumers are important because their spending has been the backbone of the current economic recovery. Increased consumption has accounted for 77 percent of the nation's economic growth since the start of last year, compared with 68 percent of growth during the economic expansion from 1982 to 1990.
One reason why consumers may now be feeling less prosperous is that higher interest rates have virtually halted the wave of mortgage refinancings that had put extra money in their pockets. By borrowing money at low interest rates and using it to pay off higher-rate mortgages, millions of American households have managed over the last several years to reduce their monthly payments.
While some families have invested the savings, others, like Jim Rice, a veterinarian in Cynthiana, Ky., have gone out and bought new cars. But now these gains from refinancings are disappearing, as higher interest rates make these deals less attractive and also raise the monthly payments of people with adjustable rates mortgages.
Refinancings reached $650 billion last year but are likely to total just $100 billion to $125 billion this year, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, a Washington trade group.
 
 
Saving Less
 At the same time, consumer spending has been rising faster than consumers' incomes. This means consumers are saving less. Average personal savings fell to 3.6 percent of after-tax income this spring, from a high of 4.9 percent in April of last year.
Without the windfall reductions in monthly debt payments from refinancings, which made consumers fell richer, people are likely to resume saving more money, said Lyle Gramley, an economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association.
Lawrence B. Lindsey, one of the five sitting Federal Reserve governors, said in an interview on Tuesday that it was unrealistic to expect the savings rate to continue to fall, and that falling retail sales in April and May showed that consumer spending was beginning to lose speed.
"There's a little more evidence that probably we're out of money," he said, while cautioning that, "You can't judge these things definitively even after two months."
Mr. Blinder of the Clinton Administration said that no one should be surprised that consumer spending was slowing.
"That's not necessarily a bad thing in the sense that in the last three quarters consumer spending has been growing at 4.5 percent," he said. "It can't continue that fast in a 3 percent economy; it should be growing at 3 percent."
 
 
Contrary Indicators
 As usual, a few contrary economic indicators muddy the picture. Strong growth in jobs this spring suggests that many families are earning more money and will have more to spend. Two commercial surveys of retail stores this month suggest that sales may be bouncing back from the drops in April and May -- which came, in any case, on the heels of very strong sales in March.
Most of the weakness in retail sales comes from a slackening in new car sales, one of the main engines of the current economic expansion. But the auto industry is hard to judge right now because dealerships have run short of popular models. Another important contributor to the current expansion, residential construction, has not yet slowed down.
Economists who believe that the growth in consumer spending is slowing, like Allen Sinai, the chief economist at Lehman Brothers, have ready explanations for all these contrary indicators. Some rebound in retail sales was inevitable, Mr. Sinai said. Housing starts tend to turn down later than the rest of the economy because they result from business decisions made one to three months earlier. And the drop in car sales showed the evaporation of pent-up demand rather than short supplies, Mr. Sinai said, as many families had bought new vehicles in the last few months after postponing such a step in the early 1990's when the economy looked weaker.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bonds Gain as Prices Of Commodities Drop

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities rose modestly yesterday after a drop in commodity prices. The session was a reverse play of the previous day, when bond prices fell in the afternoon, erasing morning gains as investors grew concerned about inflation on a surge in commodities.
Yesterday, the price of the 30-year bond rose 15/32 , to 8628/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, fell to 7.35 percent, from 7.39 percent on Wednesday. Before posting gains in the afternoon, the long bond had fallen as much as a half-point, to yield 7.45 percent. 
 The bond market has been greatly influenced by the commodities market this week, so when the Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodity futures, a closely watched indicator of inflation, rose to a three-and-a-half-year high of 239.35 on Wednesday, the market fell. When the index fell yesterday, to 237.28, the bond market rallied.
Peter McTeague, a market analyst with MCM MoneyWatch, said it was a better trading session than some traders thought. "Today dealers were getting far too negative and short on bearish news," he said. "For the most part dealers were selling, and not the customers, while the buy and hold, or large institutional investors, remained steadfast and have not been shaken out of the market."
"Looking at price action today, a yield decline in face of negative news is a bullish statement," he continued. "It means that the market has a chance to move higher in price going into next week's Treasury auction of $28 billion in new two-year and five-year notes."
 
When-Issued Trading
 In when-issued trading yesterday, the new two-year note was being offered at a price to yield 5.84 percent, down from 5.94 percent on Wednesday, and the five-year note was offered at a price to yield 6.63 percent, down from 6.69 percent the previous day.
"The yield on the long bond is still in the middle of its trading range of past few months and nothing has changed," Mr. McTeague said. "It is a market just jogging in place, waiting for that break. So bears will get short at the low end of the range, and the bulls will get long at the range high."
He said the market would continue to move within that range until there was a sharp move in commodities prices or in the dollar.
Market participants said trading was thin yesterday. The release yesterday of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's survey of regional business activity for June failed to sway the market. The Philadelphia Fed's index based on the survey rose slightly in June, but many of the price components were weaker than expected.
The Philadelphia Fed index climbed to 16.1 for June from 14.8, in line with expectations and reflecting steady forward momentum in the manufacturing sector.
Bond prices slipped in the morning after the release of the housing starts report for May and the weekly initial jobless claims data. Analysts said that while the data were not particularly alarming, a skittish market overcompensated.
 
Starts of Housing Up
 Weekly initial claims fell to 348,000 from 359,000, while May housing starts were up 2.6 percent, to an annual rate of 1.51 million units. Although the growth was entirely in apartment construction, the gain suggested to some analysts that rising interest rates had not slowed housing demand.
Comments by Edward W. Kelley Jr., a Federal Reserve governor, on a morning Birmingham, Ala., radio program helped bonds slip further, Mr. McTeague said.
The Fed governor said that he was heartened by the decline in inflation over the last several years, but that there was still work to be done as the Fed aimed for zero inflation.
The market was also weighed down by rumors early in the day, and later denied by the Pentagon, that a United States helicopter had been downed near the North Korean border.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Strengthens vs. Yen But Declines Against Mark

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar finished mixed yesterday, advancing against the Japanese yen on concern about a conflict between the United States and North Korea, but falling to its lowest level of the year against the German mark and the Swiss franc.
Much of the day's activity centered on trading among European currencies. A selloff in some of the Continent's smaller bond markets sent the mark higher as investors fled other currencies. 
 The Canadian dollar steadied at nearly 72 United States cents, after approaching an eight-year low, on intervention by the Bank of Canada.
A rumor that a United States helicopter had been shot down over South Korea helped bolster the dollar against the yen, as nervous investors fled the Japanese currency. The State Department denied the rumor.
"It was a flimsy rumor, but it came against the backdrop of nervousness over Korea," said Amy Smith, a currency strategist for IDEA, a market analysis firm.
The dollar also gained from comments by the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, indicating progress in trade talks between Washington and Tokyo, lowering the prospects of United States pressure for a higher yen to cut Japan's trade surplus.
In New York, the dollar ended at 103.45 yen, up from 102.75 late Wednesday. In late trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted at 1.6334 German marks, down from 1.6364 marks late Wednesday.
Government data released yesterday indicating economic strength were in line with the market's expectations and had little impact on currency trading, said Jack Griffin, a vice president of the Fuji Bank office in New York.
The Commerce Department said housing starts rose by 2.6 percent in May, while the Labor Department reported that weekly first-time jobless claims fell to the lowest level in nearly two months.
The currency market also shrugged off modest gains in American stock and bond prices. In recent months, the dollar has followed volatile United States financial markets as investors moved funds in and out of dollar-denominated investments.
In other trading, the British pound was quoted at $1.5205, down from $1.5215 on Wednesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday, were: 1.3700 Swiss francs, down from 1.3705, and 1,604 Italian lire, up from 1,597.

HEADLINE: Starts of Housing in May Showed Slight Increase

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 16

 BODY:
Building starts on homes rose modestly in May despite higher mortgage rates, the Commerce Department said today, but the growth came entirely from apartment construction.
The annual rate of housing starts rose 2.6 percent, to an annual rate of 1.51 million units, following a revised drop of 3.1 percent in April. The seasonally adjusted figures surprised economists, who had expected a decline in May. Housing is one of the first economic sectors to feel the impact of changes in interest rates. 
 "The fact that consumer confidence is rising and that jobs are a little easier to get is softening the blow" on the housing market, Stan Duobinis, an economist with the National Association of Home Builders, said.
 
 
Jobless Claims Fall
 Also today, the Labor Department reported an improvement in the jobs outlook. The number of claims for jobless benefits fell to 348,000 in the week ended June 11. It was the lowest level since April 23, when 336,000 claims were filed.
The agency revised its previous week's totals to 359,000 claims from the 358,000 reported earlier.
The latest total was less than what had been expected by many economists, who had forecast claims to edge down to 355,000.
"It caught people a little bit by surprise," Anthony Chan, a senior economist at Banc One Investment Advisors in Columbus, Ohio, said. "This breathes fresh air into signs of improvement in labor market."
The department's closely watched four-week moving average, considered a more reliable barometer than the more volatile weekly number, declined to 357,750 last week from 362,500 a week earlier.
Despite economic improvement, there were signs of a slowdown in housing. Mr. Duobinis said that surveys of builders indicated the number of visitors to model-home sites was falling. Most are planning, he said, for "a gentle drift downward" in construction activity to about 1.38 million new homes for all of 1994.
 
 
Single-Family Starts Off
 All the strength in housing construction last month was in new apartment building. There were fewer single-family homes started than in April, which analysts said suggests the market had peaked.
"It's a little troubling," said David Lereah, an economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association, because May is typically the beginning of the spring buying season for families considering a new home or a move.
Construction of single-family homes fell five-tenths of 1 percent in May, to an annual rate of 1.20 million units, after falling by 5 percent in April. Starts on apartments were up 16.7 percent in May, to a rate of 308,000.
Mortgage rates have risen sharply since touching bottom in October at a 25-year low of 6.74 percent. The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation said today that the rate on 30-year mortgages rose this week to 8.33 percent from 8.25 percent a week earlier.
Most of the building increase in May occurred in the South, where starts rose 11.2 percent, to an annual rate of 694,000. The only other region where they rose was in the West, up 4.1 percent, to a rate of 355,000. Home construction fell 8.2 percent, to a rate of 134,000, in the Northeast, and dropped 9.4 percent, to 327,000 a year, in the Midwest.

HEADLINE: Poor Mother, Poor Child

 BODY:
Every year nearly 400,000 Americans are born to girls with no high school diplomas, no husbands and few prospects. Eighty percent of those babies will know poverty and, more likely than not, be cruelly affected by its pathologies. Many of them will replicate their mothers' lives -- and become single parents themselves. Soon they will be responsible for one out of every three children born in this country.
But not financially responsible. Last year benefits for families begun by poor teen-agers cost the United States $34 billion. The price those young mothers and their children have paid for being born into poverty is beyond counting. 
 This week President Clinton introduced his plan to "end welfare as we know it" and get such youngsters off the dole and into jobs. But how can they be persuaded not to become pregnant in the first place? The solution is as easy to state as it is hard to execute: Give them a good reason not to.
Most adolescents know how to avoid pregnancy. According to a report from the Alan Guttmacher Institute, the pregnancy rate among sexually experienced teen-agers actually fell 19 percent between 1972 and 1990. But because the proportion of teen-agers who have had intercourse grew during this time, the overall number of pregnancies stayed the same, about one million a year.
Two-thirds of teen-agers use some method of contraception the first time they have sex. But because there is a gap between sexual initiation and marriage (if, indeed, they do marry), they run a big risk of out-of-wedlock pregnancy. Making contraceptives easily available to adolescents, then, may help -- but it is not enough. Neither, clearly, is preaching abstinence. Neither, so far, is preaching responsibility -- especially to people whose own parents have taken little responsibility for them.
Going after absentee fathers for child support, as President Clinton proposes, is one way to impose responsibility. Providing grants to schools and community programs so they can institute teen pregnancy prevention programs, as he also proposes, is also promising. But what this nation's poorest teen-agers need most is a fervent, and well-grounded, belief that postponing pregnancy can mean an education, a job and, above all, a way out of poverty and into the American mainstream.

HEADLINE: Don't Exaggerate North Korean Military Threat;
The Wider Context

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your sterling June 4 editorial calling for United Nations sanctions against North Korea shows how even the most reasonable people can be misled by righteous indignation. Unfortunately, such a sentiment is wholly misplaced when dealng with a situation as complicated -- and explosive -- as that on the Korean peninsula. 
 It is impossible to gain a realistic appreciation of the North Korean nuclear issue unless we see it in its political and strategic context. The two Korean regimes find themselves in a fluid environment, caught up in sweeping changes in internal politics and foreign relations. They are insecure and confused, not sure whether to move toward reunification or stay divided, whether to make peace or continue their conflict.
The 1991 accord committed the two sides to a path of reconciliation. But its premature signing instigated backlash, reviving old fears and creating new mistrust, which plunged the peninsula into another round of arms race. The South has stepped up its purchase of state-of-the-art weapons, using its abundant financial resources. The North, being without such economic resources, appears to have settled on nuclear weapons as the cheap but effective equalizer.
Although the political dynamics of the renewed conflict between the two Koreas is fraught with danger, there are positive developments:
No one -- least of all, Koreans -- is interested in fighting another war in Korea. Everyone agrees that the peninsula should remain denuclearized. The 1991 North-South Agreement for Reconciliation and the North-South Declaration for Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula are both still in place. The United States and North Korea are continuing bilateral talks. South Korea is on record as committed to a "broad and thorough" review of its relations with the North. That is, it is ready to consider far-reaching changes in all areas of their relations, economic, political and strategic.
Together, these developments form a framework of peace in Korea, in which to find a workable solution of the current crisis.
Put another way, the solution to North Korea's nuclear issue can be best found through amelioration of two sets of relations: North-South relations and United States-North Korean relations. Unfortunately, the international community's preoccupation with North Korea's alleged nuclear program distracts from that task.
While it is highly doubtful that United Nations sanctions would have the desired effect on North Korea, they are virtually guaranteed to wreak havoc with reconciliation between the two Koreas. (Already, loose talk coming out of South Korea's Blue House has done enough damage.)
A more constructive approach, as well as a more interesting one, is that suggested by Russia, which involves the convening of an eight-power conference (five permanent members of the Security Council plus Japan and the two Koreas).
Such a conference, addressing Pyongyang's nuclear problem in a wider political context, holds the prospect of producing a comprehensive settlement that would facilitate North Korea's cooperation in nuclear nonproliferation.

HEADLINE: What Illegal Aliens Cost the Taxpayer

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Stop Benefits for Aliens? It Wouldn't Be That Easy" (front page, June 8) is bold in its attempt to profile the entire problem of illegal aliens receiving taxpayer benefits through the experience of one mother of three. 
 Your article states that taxpayers at all levels of government spend $7 billion a year on illegal aliens. (Others estimate twice that.) Two-thirds of the cost, you state, go to education and medical care. You also focus on such other costs as welfare, which you estimate totals roughly $2.3 billion a year.
Readers (that is, taxpayers) could be forgiven for finding your article's analysis as porous as our national borders.
In support of your claim that illegals do not enter the United States for benefits, you quote Laura C. as saying she came to the United States to work. But she now exists in a one-bedroom apartment on private charity and public benefits.
In positing that illegals are not eligible for many welfare programs, you note that Laura C. (meaning in this case her children) receives only food benefits totaling $46.50 a week.
What the article does not say is whether Laura C. receives any benefits illegally. The Immigration and Naturalization Service estimates that 40 percent of illegal aliens do.
You report that Laura C.'s youngest child, born in Texas at taxpayer cost in a public hospital, and thus a United States citizen, has the rights to welfare of any native-born American. But you do not venture any cost. Nor do you mention the public or private costs of criminal aliens, displaced legal residents on welfare and unemployment insurance.
The result? You have by this means transformed a multibillion-dollar-a-year problem into a $46.50-a-week problem.
In closing, your article attempts to demonstrate that even if government benefits are cut off, illegal aliens will remain in the United States, rather than return home.
Your evidence: Laura C.'s resounding declaration, "I don't think I would leave."
Inquiring minds must wonder why it is that your article consistently tags those who support the rights of legal residents first as "politicians," while at the same time you label as "experts" those who support the unlimited right of illegal aliens to cut in line ahead of those millions of people around the world who have waited years to enter the United States legally.

HEADLINE: Arafat Appears Reluctant to Shift Base to Jericho

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERICHO, West Bank, June 16

 BODY:
With each passing day, it seems, a new reason is added for the delay in Yasir Arafat's arrival to formally take over the administration of Palestinian rule in the Gaza Strip and in Jericho.
This morning Khalid Musmar, identified as the press officer of the Palestinian embassy in Amman, said the Palestine Liberation Organization chairman may further delay his much anticipated arrival in Jericho because Israel is preventing Palestinians from completing an airfield that would allow his helicopter to land and take off. 
 A couple of weeks ago, the 65-year-old Mr. Arafat said he would delay his arrival if international financial aid pledged by the World Bank and many other donors, including the United States and the European Union, was not forthcoming.
 
Is Jericho Too Hot?
 In the grocery downstairs from the Jericho municipal offices, the proprietor, a middle-aged bearded man with a pleasant disposition, thinks the problem is that Soha, Mr. Arafat's 34-year-old wife, "doesn't like the idea of living here in the summer." Sultry Jericho, 820 feet below sea level, has summer temperatures that are already edging past 100 degrees and are bound to climb further.
Some say Mr. Arafat is avoiding Jericho because it is not just hot, but ugly, too. Others mention security concerns.
But the most likely reason emerges in conversations with some of the P.L.O. officials here and in Gaza who have been acting as advance scouts for Mr. Arafat in the past six weeks. They say he is delaying the moment when he must abandon the secretive, somewhat glamorous life of a guerrilla leader and adopts the much more mundane role of leader of a small and impoverished country.
 
A 'Banana Republic'
 "Let's face it," said a top P.L.O. official in Gaza. "The moment he enters Palestine, he is going to be the head of the smallest banana republic in the world, which has more problems than he has ever had to face."
Jericho, where Mr. Arafat is expected to live initially, is indeed the West Bank's banana capital, producing and exporting large amounts of the fruit.
Outside of that it has few attractions. There are a few tourists, largely from October to May, when its warm climate is welcome. There is little to see; the biggest attractions on the tiny central square are the rooftop satellite dishes and high-tech equipment set up by the television networks waiting for Mr. Arafat.
A senior Western diplomat in Tel Aviv said his embassy has reached the conclusion that the P.L.O. chairman is wary of the reaction of Palestinians here to his arrival.
 
Repairing an Image
 Virtually all pictures of Mr. Arafat hanging in the offices of the police force and elsewhere in Palestinian National Authority offices show him with two other leaders of the P.L.O. who died a few years ago, but whose popularity easily rivals Mr. Arafat's. They are Salah Khalaf, who was killed in Tunis in 1988, and Khalil al-Wazir, killed there in 1991. Their deaths stripped the movement of likely heirs to Mr. Arafat.
The association with dead heroes of the Palestinian movement is meant to buttress Mr. Arafat's image, which has suffered heavily in the past few months from a growing perception that he is disconnected from his people and their concerns.
"He wants all his security and police people firmly in place before he lands in Jericho or Gaza," the diplomat said.
Over the past two weeks, a new breed of Palestinian security people have been streaming into Gaza and Jericho. They are Palestinian men in civilian clothes who bear the no-nonsense looks of intelligence operatives and have authority that transcends that of the uniformed police and security forces who have been, by and large, rather friendly and indecisive.
In order to insure the best reception possible, Mr. Arafat is trying to build a pool of money to be spent upon arrival to win favors and pacify people, but P.L.O. officials say the cash has been slow to materialize.
Although some $2.4 billion has been pledged by world donors over the next five years to jump-start the process, little more than $50 million has reached the P.L.O. so far. Much of the money is committed for projects of one kind or another, not for operating expenses like the salaries of the Palestinian police and bureaucrats.
 
No Pay for the Police
 Most of the estimated 8,000 or so police officers who have moved into Gaza and Jericho still have not been paid and their mood is souring. "I have been here nearly two months and have yet to receive a salary," said Lieut. Col. Hamdi el-Rifi, head of the criminal investigation division of the Gaza police force.
"Europe and America talk about peace on television but they are not fulfilling their financial commitments," he said. "I have World War II-vintage cars here to chase after criminals who have much better vehicles. These clips on my desk, the desk itself, are gifts for which we have yet to pay. This is no way to run a state."

HEADLINE: Arafat Appears Reluctant to Shift Base to Jericho

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERICHO, West Bank, June 16

 BODY:
With each passing day, it seems, a new reason is added for the delay in Yasir Arafat's arrival to formally take over the administration of Palestinian rule in the Gaza Strip and in Jericho.
This morning Khalid Musmar, identified as the press officer of the Palestinian embassy in Amman, said the Palestine Liberation Organization chairman may further delay his much anticipated arrival in Jericho because Israel is preventing Palestinians from completing an airfield that would allow his helicopter to land and take off. 
 A couple of weeks ago, the 65-year-old Mr. Arafat said he would delay his arrival if international financial aid pledged by the World Bank and many other donors, including the United States and the European Union, was not forthcoming.
 
Is Jericho Too Hot?
 In the grocery downstairs from the Jericho municipal offices, the proprietor, a middle-aged bearded man with a pleasant disposition, thinks the problem is that Soha, Mr. Arafat's 34-year-old wife, "doesn't like the idea of living here in the summer." Sultry Jericho, 820 feet below sea level, has summer temperatures that are already edging past 100 degrees and are bound to climb further.

HEADLINE: A Shift on North Korea

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 17

 BODY:
North Korea's latest offer to resolve the crisis over its nuclear program appears to include little that is new, but President Clinton's willingness to seize it as an opportunity to avoid a confrontation reflects an abrupt shift of policy.
The change says less about the prospects for a diplomatic resolution than it does about the Administration's apprehensions over a showdown and its difficulties in marshaling an international coalition for tough sanctions. 
 The White House got to the precipice of economic sanctions and sending military reinforcements, was nervous about what it saw and decided to take another crack at diplomacy, even though that meant backing away from a key condition for high-level negotiations. The condition was its insistence that North Korea insure that monitors be allowed to take measurements to determine whether Pyongyang had ever diverted plutonium for a nuclear weapon.
Administration officials say they are merely exploring new signs of flexibility on the part of the North Koreans, and they argue that any agreement in which North Korea would freeze its nuclear weapons program while high-level talks proceed would be a good bargain for the United States.
"As the President said yesterday, our policy has not changed one iota," said Anthony Lake, Mr. Clinton's national security adviser.
But the officials also acknowledged that the details of the North Korean proposal, which would allow international monitors to remain in North Korea as long as Washington made "good-faith efforts" to negotiate, remain to be clarified.
And they acknowledge that former President Jimmy Carter complicated the picture by asserting wrongly that Washington had stopped "sanction activity" in the United Nations, where the officials said the United States is still consulting with other nations on the possibility of sanctions.
But even supporters of the Administration's new approach say it represents a major change in Washington's stance.
Representative Gary L. Ackerman, the Queens Democrat who visited North Korea in October, said the Administration was right to try to follow up any opening that might have been created by Mr. Carter's diplomacy in Pyongyang. But Mr. Ackerman added that the North Korean statements, which the White House has hailed as signs of a new policy, reflected longstanding positions.
Mr. Ackerman said "almost everything" that the North Koreans had proposed had been floated before. "They have sold it to somebody new at a different time," he said, referring to Mr. Carter.
Some experts were more critical.
"There has been a clear change in our position. We put our markers down, and now we are doing the very thing that we said was unacceptable," said Zalmay Khalilzad, the head of the Pentagon's office of policy planning in the Bush Administration. "When you state you won't do something and then you do it, it undermines your credibility."
 
Dispute Began Last Year
 The controversy arose last year, when the International Atomic Energy Agency determined that North Korea had produced more plutonium than it had acknowledged when it shut down its nuclear reactor at Yongbyon in 1989. The agency then sought to carry out additional inspections to confirm its findings.
The inspections were important because the Central Intelligence Agency believes that the North Koreans diverted enough plutonium for one or two bombs, while Pyongyang says it produced only a minute quantity of plutonium.
But the North Koreans balked at allowing the inspections.
That put the ball in the Administration's court, and officials debated how to respond. Pentagon officials argued that it was more important to limit the North Korean program in the future than to resolve the mystery of the past diversion, but they were overruled.
Taking a resolute stance, the Administration vowed not to engage in high-level talks unless the North Koreans took steps to freeze their plutonium production and insure that monitors could take future measurements to determine whether and how much plutonium was diverted when the reactor was shut down in 1989.
 
U.S. Demands Ignored
 But the North Koreans ignored the American demands.
In April, they shut down the Yongbyon reactor yet again and withdrew its fuel rods, destroying the evidence that inspectors needed to determine its past plutonium diversion.
In response, the Administration announced that it would seek economic sanctions and that it would not engage in high-level talks.
"This act undercuts the basis for our dialogue with North Korea," Robert L. Gallucci, the Assistant Secretary of State for Politico-Military Affairs, told the House Foreign Affairs on June 9. "We will not continue that dialogue until a reasonable basis for it can be re-established."
Until Thursday, the Administration held to its position that North Korea had not offered a sufficient basis to resume high-level talks. But when North Korea repeated its interest in holding high-level talks to Mr. Carter, Washington's stance changed.
Mr. Clinton announced that American officials were willing to engage in talks if North Korea would freeze its nuclear program by refraining from future processing of plutonium and from refueling the reactor at Yongbyon and by allowing international inspectors to stay at Yongbyon.
By exclusion it dropped its condition on making it possible to trace past plutonium diversion.
In effect, Washington went for the most risk-free approach. It put aside the policies that were difficult, that required the painful building of international coalitions and that raised the prospect of military intervention.
 
 
Any Headway Unclear
 By today, it was unclear whether headway had been made. Pak Gil Yon, North Korea's representative to the United Nations, denied that North Korea would ever allow monitors to inspect its waste sites to try to determine the extent of its past plutonium diversion.
If the Administration's diplomatic gambit works, Washington will have succeeded in the short run in limiting -- but not erasing -- the North Korean nuclear menace.
But if it fails, the credibility of the Administration's foreign policy, already under question for flip-flops over China, Haiti and Somalia, may come under fire.
"I am not surprised that the North Koreans took the opportunity of the visit of a former President of the United States to 'send a message,' " Mr. Gallucci said today. "What we don't know really is the meaning of that message, and particularly what we don't know is whether the message they intend to send is really one in which one can see a desire in fact to re-establish a dialogue."

HEADLINE: Hoboken Council Votes to Close Bars at 1 A.M.

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HOBOKEN, N.J., June 17

 BODY:
The Hoboken City Council voted today to crack down on the raucous night life here, moving up the closing time for bars to 1 A.M. in an effort to tame the crowds of young people whose drunken antics often make some historic avenues seem like fraternity row during rush week.
The new ordinance was the latest salvo in a long-running battle between local leaders and more than 100 bar and restaurant owners in Hoboken, which in recent years has become increasingly popular among suburban college students eager to avoid the hassle of traveling to New York City. 
 Mayor Anthony Russo and other officials acknowledged that the thousands of visitors who descend upon Hoboken on Friday and Saturday nights had helped to revive this once-moribund Hudson River port, but they said they could no longer tolerate the unruly behavior of some revelers.
"I am very much concerned about the safety of the citizens here," Mayor Russo said in an interview before the council voted 7-0 to push forward the closing time, which is currently 3 A.M. on weekends and 2 A.M. on weekdays. "We need something to protect them."
Carmen LaBruno, the Hoboken police chief, said drinking-related offenses had become so common that he no longer thought that the bars were an economic boon.
"When you do a cost-benefit analysis, we lose," he said. "We have had to significantly increase our law-enforcement, our fire department and our public works staff. If we didn't have the bar problems, I could cut my police force by 25 percent. My highest concentration of manpower is on the 8 P.M. to 4 A.M. shift, Thursday, Friday and Saturday. All in the area of the bars."
 
Bar Owners Angered
 But bar and restaurant owners said they were angered by the change, contending that it would kill their business and hurt the many Hobokenites who earn their paychecks working the beer taps, waiting on tables, driving taxis or otherwise tending to the needs of visitors.
The owners criticized local officials for refusing to compromise and insisted that they were taking steps to control the drunken young people who often stagger from bar to bar in the early morning hours, waking up residents with their shouts, vandalizing property and urinating in public. The police issue dozens of summonses for drinking-related violations each weekend.
"Hoboken has come back in large measure because of the entertainment and restaurant business," said Dennis Oury, a lawyer for the Hoboken Tavern, Restaurant and Businessmen's Association. "My people understand that there are problems they have to address, but they don't think that throwing out the baby with the bathwater is the answer."
The new ordinance, to go into effect on Saturday, capped weeks of legal wrangling during which the City Council first tried to require that bars and restaurants institute a "one-way door" policy. Under this rule, these establishments could close at 3 A.M. on weekends, but would have to stop admitting patrons at 1 A.M.
But after Mr. Oury challenged that ordinance in Superior Court a few weeks ago, it was thrown out by a judge on a technicality. The City Council then decided it needed the stricter regulation in force during the World Cup, which begins at the Meadowlands in nearby East Rutherford on Saturday.
The council has also reintroduced the one-way door ordinance. James Fitzsimmons, the council president, and other members said they would seek to repeal the tougher rule in favor of the one-way door policy after the World Cup ends in late July.
"My feeling from the beginning has been that I would prefer to experiment with the less drastic measure than an early closing," Mr. Fitzsimmons said. "We do have some fears about the negative impact from the one o'clock closing."
Long-time residents say Hoboken began its ascent after bars took over the site of the landmark Clam Broth House a few years ago and started advertising heavily to attract college students from around the New York region.
But some bar owners say they should not be punished for the supposed sins of the rowdier watering holes.
"We are literally going out of business, and we don't understand why," said Paula Reilly, owner of Pipe Dreams Cafe, a small neighborhood bar at 239 Bloomfield Street.
"The fine people that were coming here, they are reading all this, and they are saying, 'Gee, we better not go to Hoboken,' because it appears that there is this terrible problem," she said. "But Hoboken has never been safer. New York would love to have the petty problems we have."

HEADLINE: Oil Surges Past $20 a Barrel, Depressing Stocks

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
Nervous financial markets were thrown into confusion yesterday, and prices declined sharply after the price of oil surged past $20 a barrel for the first time in more than a year.
A prolonged rise in oil prices, coming just before the peak of the summer driving season, would have broad inflationary implications, analysts said. The rise may also signal a significant tightening of supplies after 13 years of falling prices and varying degrees of glut. It would also further unnerve financial markets that have been obsessed with the course of inflation that, so far, has been unexpectedly mild. 
 "My, it was a messy day," said Dudley Eppel, managing director in charge of listed trading at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. "Oil sent commodities way up, took a big bite out of bonds, took down all the leading stock indexes and sent the dollar down."
Crude oil for July delivery rose 80 cents, to $20.71 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange, a 14-month high.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 34.56 points, to 3,776.78; for the week, it declined 3.33.
Bond prices fell sharply yesterday, and the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose to 7.44 percent, from 7.35 percent on Thursday.
The dollar fell against most currencies, reaching an eight-month low against the German mark. In New York, the dollar dropped more than two pfennigs, to 1.6105 marks.
Despite the turmoil in the currency markets, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said at a news conference in San Antonio that the dollar would stabilize because the economy was sound. "The underlying fundamentals are excellent," Mr. Bentsen said. "I'm comfortable with the economy. Inflation is low, and the numbers are the best I've seen in 20 years."
A quarterly phenomenon, known as the "triple-witching hour," in which traders buy or sell stocks in accordance with expiring options, led to unusually large trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange. The larger number of shares changing hands probably accelerated the price decline. Trading volume totaled 387 million shares, more than 30 percent more than this year's average of 295 million shares.
The most widely cited reasons for the rise in oil prices were falling crude supplies for Midwest oil refineries and a belief that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would not increase production for the year.
A growing number of speculators may also be contributing to the increase in oil prices.
But some analysts say commodities traders are only now realizing that the refining capacity of the United States is nearing its upper limits, raising the possibility of supply shortages in the Midwest.
Matthew R. Simmons, founder and head of Simmons & Company, an investment bank in Houston that specializes in the oil-services industry, said about 96 percent of nationwide refining capacity was being used last week, compared with a rate in the low 90's in the comparable period a year ago and a rate of 65.8 percent in 1982, the historic low.
"Without anybody really noticing all that much," Mr. Simmons said, "it's been creeping up and up, until we're up to full capacity, then we need to build more capacity, and that will take time." Mr. Simmons said an oil shortage could not be ruled out, but that it was difficult to estimate its potential magnitude at this time.
"What's important to realize is that the world needs about 68 million barrels a day, and OPEC produces less than 40 percent of that," Mr. Simmons said. "Everyone else is producing everything they can, except for the United States and Russia, which are in decline."
Along with the rise in oil prices, unleaded gasoline gained 1.73 cents, to 55.20 cents a gallon, and heating oil rose 1.50 cents, to 52.02 cents a gallon.
Unlike other increases in the closely watched Commodity Research Bureau index, which has gyrated mainly because of fears of a drought in the Midwest and its impact on wheat, corn and soybeans, the rise in the index yesterday was dominated by the increases in oil prices. The C.R.B. rose 2.1 points to 239.38 yesterday, the highest since August 1990, when the most recent recession started taking hold.
A key indicator of the markets' concern was a steep rise in gold, a barometer of traders' concern about inflation. Gold for August delivery rose $6.20, to $393.70 an ounce.
"Clearly, the market now has a wider basis for concern over these numbers," said Bernard C. Savaiko, a senior analyst who follows the C.R.B. index for Paine Webber Futures. "A C.R.B. that's moved by oil has a greater ripple effect on the economy than a C.R.B. that's moved by soybeans."
Yesterday morning, bonds and the dollar registered the first impact of the rising oil prices. Bondholders fear that inflation will erode the underlying value of bonds, and investors in the dollar fear that inflation will weaken its purchasing power.
The stock market followed. Its opening was affected by the first phase of frenetic "triple-witching" trading, when three sets of options and futures contracts, particularly those based on indexes like the Standard & Poor's 500, simultaneously expire each quarter.
Blue-chip stocks like Boeing and Sears & Roebuck, retailers like Wal-Mart and oil companies like Chevron, as well as over-the-counter stocks like Oracle and Microsoft, were hurt in the fall.
Quaker Oats rose 7 3/8, to 78 1/2, amid market speculation that it could be a takeover target, possibly by Nestle of Switzerland. Both Quaker Oats and Nestle declined comment.
The most active stock, at 15.9 million shares, was Cheyenne Software, which fell 8 3/8, to 8, following an announcement by the company that its fourth-quarter earnings would be lower than expected.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 3.48 points yesterday, to 458.45, and the smaller-company Nasdaq composite index fell 5.62 points, to 729.35. The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 1.70 points, to 253.29, with advancing stocks lagging declining stocks by 769 to 1,429. The American Stock Exchange market value fell 1.52 points, to 440.26.
Of the 30 component stocks that make up the Dow industrials, 23 fell, led by Boeing, which dropped 1 1/2, to 48 3/8, after the company announced that its helicopter business would lay off 2,200 workers because of a delay in a Pentagon contract for Osprey helicopters.
Of the 500 component stocks that make up the S.& P. 500, 323 fell, led by Wal-Mart, which was down 7/8, to 24 1/8.

HEADLINE: First Rulings For Haitians: Yes to 6 of 35

BYLINE: By JOHN KIFNER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ABOARD THE COMFORT, Kingston Harbor, Jamaica, June 17

 BODY:
This huge white hospital ship, the U.S.S. Comfort, which has been turned into a floating immigration bureaucracy, meted out its first judgments today as the instrument of the latest shift in President Clinton's Haiti policy.
Now, when fleeing Haitians are plucked from their rickety wooden sailboats by one of a dozen United States Coast Guard cutters on patrol in the Caribbean, they are brought to a shipboard world of computers, interviews, forms and files. That leads to the difficult decision by an Immigration and Naturalization Service officer on whether each individual will be allowed into the United States. 
 This afternoon, 29 Haitians -- including two pregnant women and a baby -- from the first group of 35 taken from three boats by the Coast Guard on Wednesday slumped silently on the Comfort's upper decks.
They were to be sent back to Haiti.
 
Six Were Accepted
 Six young men, found to be qualified for refugee status, strode buoyantly to an Air Force C-130 at Norman Manley airport at 9 A.M. today, each swinging a small plastic bag of belongings. They had arrived in a white tour bus bearing the word "Smile."
The difference lay in the credibility immigration officials placed in the reasons the Haitians gave for claiming the "well founded fear of persecution" should they return to Haiti and its brutal military dictatorship.
Haitians have fled their homeland in fear since a military coup in September 1991 unseated the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the country's first democratically elected President. Since then, he has remained in exile and the United States and other countries have attempted to oust the military rulers by applying diplomatic and economic pressure.
The decision on whether a Haitian is sent back or is granted refugee status is based on an interview with the Immigration inspectors, a process that finally rests on individual judgment and is somewhat amorphous or, as Kathleen Thompson, director of the I.N.S. Refugee Division, put it: "squishy."
"There are intrinsic difficulties," she said. "There can be human rights violations that are truly horrific, but don't fall under the five categories."
 
A Focus on Politics
 The categories are a fear of persecution based on race, on nationality, on religion, on membership in a social organization or on a political opinion, although Ms. Thompson said that for Haitians, political opinion was the most likely claim.
"We take into account the whole circumstances of an individual case," she said. "We try to evaluate each claim in its entire context and credibility. Geographical area, for example, can be important because we know certain areas are hotbeds of resistance activity or have repression, and this could affect credibility."
Still, she added, "a person can have embellished his claim and still be a refugee."
When running for President, Mr. Clinton was sharply critical of what he called the Bush Administration's "immoral" policy of returning all Haitians picked up at sea. But once in office, responding largely to political pressures against the influx of black Haitian refugees, he reversed himself and kept sending Haitians back.
Civil rights groups and immigration advocates have denounced the Administration policy as "racist." Responding to the mounting pressure, the Administration set up the shipboard interviewing process, which has mobilized a task force of slightly over 1,000 military and civilian personnel, and is working on setting up a processing center on the Turks and Caicos Islands.
 
A United Nations Role
 The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which has been critical of the policy of returning refugees, has 11 lawyers aboard the Comfort to monitor the processing. The United Nations representatives also deliver a 20-minute orientation lecture to the Haitians.
"There are a lot of hard-working people on that boat," Barbara Francis, a spokeswoman for the refugees commission, said after conferring with the shipboard observers this afternoon. "But the system will really be tested when the pressure of numbers comes along."
Haitians intercepted at sea are brought onto the ship, a converted supertanker, from a ramp into the starboard hull. Almost immediately, each Haitian is fitted with a plastic identification bracelet, similar to those given to hospital patients, but these are equipped with an electronic chip inscribed with their identity and background information.
Cases of water are stacked ready for the Haitians, who are likely to be dehydrated from their rides on small boats under the hot sun, and workers who speak Creole are on hand to provide reassurance to people who have grown wary of uniforms and authority.
 
Avoiding Intimidation
 "We are very concerned about having the refugees feel comfortable and not intimidated," Lieut. Pete Mitchell of the United States Marines explained to journalists brought aboard the ship for a tour this afternoon.
About 200 marines are on the ship as a security detail as well as U.S. Navy doctors and nurses and military personnel from other branches.
Deep inside the ship, in a compartment filled with computers and makeshift interview booths, the immigration inspectors review the files assembled by interpreters for each incoming applicant and then conduct the critical final interview. Some of the computers have records of violent episodes in Haiti, which are to be updated each week, to help confirm the charges made by the Haitians who fled their country.
 
Taking Their Time
 "We had the luxury of time," said the chief of the shipboard immigration inspectors, Arthur Nieto, saying the interviews for this group each lasted about an hour and forty-five minutes.
"We try to get as much information as we can," Mr. Nieto said.
"We would like them to be at ease. We are always reinforcing, telling them, 'Is there anything else you would like to say?' "
The journalists brought aboard the ship were not allowed to speak to the Haitians who had been rejected. Nor would immigration officials give examples of what might or might not be a successful case, saying they did not want to provide a how-to for future applicants.
For those approved for refugee status -- the fortunate six today -- the final stop on the ship is for a medical exam, and then interpreters let them know they have made it. Then they are flown to Guantanamo Bay Navy Base for further processing.
"They were actually very excited," said Commander David Barnette, the head of the medical section. "They were high-fiving."

HEADLINE: G.M. Dealt Setback On Hughes

BYLINE: By By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 17

 BODY:
A Federal judge ruled today that the Hughes Aircraft Company was entitled to only a small fraction of the $3 billion in royalties and back interest that it had sought from the Government in a 21-year-old legal dispute over a satellite-technology patent.
The decision marked a setback to the parent company of Hughes, the General Motors Corporation, and could prevent the wave of patent claims against the Government that patent experts had predicted if Hughes had won a larger settlement. 
 Hughes officials estimated that the decision would be worth $114 million, and said they had not decided whether to appeal the ruling to the United States Court of Appeals.
 
'Good-Sized Sum'
 "It's still $114 million -- it's a good-sized sum," said Richard Dore, a spokesman for Hughes.
Judge James Turner of the United States Court of Federal Claims had ruled last year that the Government owed Hughes royalties for having used the technology for steering satellites during the last quarter century.
But Judge Turner decided that Hughes was entitled to royalty payments of only 1 percent of the value of 81 Government satellites that used the disputed technology, rather than the 15 percent royalty that Hughes had sought. Hughes was not entitled to any more money because it had offered to license the patent to other companies in the 1970's for less than 3 percent of the value of satellites, Judge Turner ruled.
 
'Supported by the Evidence'
 Judge Turner awarded back interest according to a method proposed by Hughes and based on the interest rate applied by the Internal Revenue Service to overdue tax rebates. Hughes calculated that the verdict was worth nearly $36 million, plus $78 million in back interest; the Justice Department did not have an immediate estimate tonight.
Government lawyers had argued that a royalty of 1 percent was appropriate, and welcomed today's ruling. "It's really the rate that is supported by the evidence -- it's still a lot of money," said Vito J. DiPietro, a senior Justice Department lawyer who worked on the case.
Many patent lawyers had anticipated that Judge Turner would split the difference between the Government's royalty figure and the Hughes figure, producing a verdict of at least $1 billion.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Air Force and the Navy have all used satellites that incorporated the Hughes system. The Justice Department represented them in the case.
Mr. DiPietro said he was not aware of any decision among the three agencies on how to divide the responsibility for paying the royalties, or where the money would come from. Hughes said in a statement that 68 of the 81 satellites were military.
Mr. Dore of Hughes said it was also unclear whether the money would be paid directly to Hughes or to General Motors.
Today's decision is the latest chapter in one of the longest and most complex patent cases in the country.
At the core of the dispute is a satellite system invented in 1959 by a Hughes engineer, Donald Williams. He developed a simple method to control the position and spin of a satellite relative to the earth and the sun. The system made it possible to thrust a satellite from an orbit several hundred miles up into a geosynchronous orbit 22,300 miles in space, where a satellite appears to maintain a fixed position over the rotating earth.
Mr. Williams's invention was used in 1963 on the first geosynchronous satellite successfully launched, Syncom 2, and on some satellites used in low-earth orbits, like the Atmospheric Explorers.
The system proposed by Mr. Williams called for two slits in the shape of a "V" on one side of a satellite. Ground controllers would measure the frequency with which each slit was exposed to the sun as the satellite spun so as to determine its position and order it to fire thruster rockets accordingly.
The Government issued a patent to Mr. Williams in 1973, after Hughes had fought a seven-year battle with NASA in a patent appeals process. Hughes then filed suit seeking payment for the Government's use of the technology. Mr. Williams has since died.
The Government contended that it did not owe Hughes anything because the company had won a Government contract to develop the technology in 1961. But Judge Turner ruled on Aug. 17, 1993, that the Government would have to pay royalties. Today's decision determined the amount of those royalties as a percentage of the satellites' value, which Judge Turner set at $3.58 billion in another decision on last April 29.
Hughes based its claim of 15 percent royalties on a 1965 agreement with the Communications Satellite Corporation that used that figure. But Judge Turner ruled today that the agreement was not a good precedent because it was reached at a time when Hughes was the only company that had successfully launched a geosynchronous satellite, and so had a strong grip on the market. The 15 percent figure also applied to two technologies, not just Mr. Williams's system, Judge Turner wrote.
Hughes later asked for more modest royalties from other satellite builders. Judge Turner asked in his decision today that if the system was worth 15 percent royalties, "why was Hughes offering to license the Williams invention to its major commercial competitors early in the patent term -- the time of maximum value -- for less than 3 percent of total spacecraft cost (making no mention of the 1965 Comsat agreement), and why were there no takers among three of the world's leading satellite manufacturers, not even a counter-offer from two of them."

HEADLINE: Bonds Tumble as Fears Focus Anew on Inflation

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The bond market sold off sharply yesterday, pushing interest rates to their highest point in more than a month as the plunging dollar and climbing commodity prices raised investors' fears of more inflation and even higher interest rates.
The Federal Reserve may increase interest rates as early as July 5, when its policy-making Federal Open Market Committee meets again, said William Stevens, a top executive at Montgomery Asset Management. 
 The Treasury's 30-year bond fell nearly a point, while its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 7.44 percent, from 7.35 percent on Thursday. Yields on shorter-term and intermediate Treasury issues also jumped.
Ian MacKinnon, who heads $54 billion in fixed-income investments at the Vanguard Group, attributed much of the market's nervousness to the dollar's selloff. "Continued weakness in the dollar filters into import prices and the Fed has got to be concerned," about inflation, he said.
 
Dollar Down, Oil Up
 The dollar dropped more than 2 pfennigs in New York yesterday, ending at 1.6105 German marks. It also fell against most other leading currencies.
Meanwhile, oil surged above $20 a barrel for the first time in more than a year, pushing the Commodity Research Bureau's index up 2.10 points, to 239.38, its highest close in more than three and a half years.
Rising prices and a falling dollar are a lethal combination that "smells like inflation," said James Hale, senior fixed-income strategist at MMS International in San Francisco.
Mr. Stevens of Montgomery Asset Management agreed, noting that the dollar's weakness "implies that our rates aren't high enough to attract all the dollars going overseas."
Faster economic growth is generating concern that inflation will accelerate even though the latest Government reports do not show it. This year, consumer prices have increased at an annualized rate of 2.3 percent, down from 2.7 percent last year, the Labor Department said.
An inflation rate of 2.3 percent this year would be the lowest since 1986, when consumer prices rose 1.2 percent. Less inflation enhances the value of fixed-income securities.
The divergence between commodity prices and the Government's inflation indexes leaves investors with little reason to make a big bet on bonds, said Charles Quigley, a trader at Chemical Securities Inc. That means bond yields should stay in the 7.20 percent to 7.5 percent range that has persisted for five weeks, he said.
 
Consumer Confidence Rises
 Adding to concern about faster economic growth leading to inflation was an increase in a closely watched consumer sentiment index.
The University of Michigan's preliminary consumer sentiment index for June rose to 94.5 from 92.8 in May, its highest since September 1989, people with access to the survey said.
Consumer confidence climbed even as interest rates have risen, reflecting an economy that should maintain its strength, said Steven Saslow, executive managing director at HSBC Securities Inc.
"The economy is improving" and prospects for lower inflation "are deteriorating," Mr. Saslow said. "By August, we'll be back in the soup, as we were in May," when bond yields reached 7.66 percent%, the highest since November 1992.
"On balance, I think the market has a problem," he said.
"There's still a lot of bearish sentiment out there," said Ray Goodner at IDS Financial Services in Minneapolis.

HEADLINE: At the Gay Games, Giuliani Takes Step To Forge New Ties

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

 BODY:
Across six months in office, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has had a strained relationship with gay-rights advocates, parting ways with them on a range of issues from his long refusal to condemn a supporter who spoke out against the Gay Games to his decision to march in the St. Patrick's Day parade despite the exclusion of a group of homosexual marchers.
But tonight at a Columbia University stadium, Mr. Giuliani is scheduled to deliver a formal welcoming speech at the Gay Games. The Mayor's aides helped pave the way for closing ceremonies to be held at Yankee Stadium. And an interview with Mr. Giuliani is featured on the cover of the current issue of The Advocate, which describes itself as the national gay and lesbian news magazine. 
 The Mayor and his aides have largely portrayed his welcoming remarks as a routine civic duty at a sporting event that will bring in several hundred million dollars from tourists. But Mr. Giuliani's appearance at the Gay Games is also another step in his political self-definition and his effort to forge a Republicanism that can appeal to both "family-value" conservatives and homosexuals.
"The Mayor of New York City should be capable of protecting everyone and reaching out to everyone and saying, 'If this is your sexual orientation, then you shouldn't have to live your life thinking you're less worthy than someone else,' " Mr. Giuliani said yesterday, describing the message he wanted to send through his appearance.
"And we should be a big enough city -- and we are and we have always been -- to have people who have different sexual orientations live together with respect and understanding of each other."
Mr. Giuliani and his aides say there is no reason to be surprised by his embrace of the Gay Games. "This is a major sporting event that New York City is proud and happy to have," said Deputy Mayor Fran Reiter, who has been the administration's chief liaison with the organizers. "This is exactly the kind of event the Mayor of New York is always going to participate in."
The Mayor just this week appeared at a news conference in support of an anti-bias bill blocked by the Republican-led state Senate, which would increase penalties for bias crimes, including those whose victims were selected because of sexual orientation. And he noted that during the mayoral campaign, he marched in the Gay Pride parade.
But although Mr. Giuliani's campaign reached out to gay voters, it also took energy from the conservative rebellion on the Board of Education against a curriculum that discussed homosexuality and AIDS and against the school system's condom distribution effort. The Mayor recently used his two appointments to the board to keep the same conservative bloc in place.
 
No Condemnation of Minister
 Moreover, a Bronx organizer for the Giuliani mayoral campaign, the Rev. Ruben Diaz, has been one of the city's most outspoken opponents of the Gay Games, suggesting that they would lead to an increase in AIDS cases and to wide acceptance of homosexuality by young people.
When Mr. Diaz first denounced the Gay Games in Spanish-language publications, Mr. Giuliani said he disagreed with him, but he refused repeated requests by gay-rights advocates and liberals that he condemn the Pentecostal minister. He said Mr. Diaz's views were based on "moral theology developed over thousands of years."
"It isn't my job to condemn people," he said. "I'm not a bishop or rabbi or a priest. I'm not a moralist. I'm the Mayor of New York City. People in New York City disagree on this subject."
Only last month, when Mr. Diaz took his crusade against the Gay Games to the steps of City Hall, did Mr. Giuliani adopt a harsher tone, saying that his comments were "unwarranted and probably contribute to misunderstanding and prejudice."
How Mr. Giuliani responded to Mr. Diaz reflected his attempt in office to preach tolerance for both homosexuals and those opposed to homosexuality -- a stretch that has often left conservatives and liberals alike dissatisfied.
Mr. Giuliani gave a fuller explanation of his vision of tolerance in April, when he delivered a speech about the importance of religious values. He pointed to the controversy over whether homosexuals could march in the annual St. Patrick's Day parade, and quoted from the St. Patrick's Day homily of John Cardinal O'Connor. He repeated the Cardinal's question, "Is it bigotry for the Ancient Order of Hibernians to celebrate its values without being required to celebrate the values of others?"
 
Core Backers Likely to Stay
 "The Cardinal makes an important distinction," Mr. Giuliani said, "one that is difficult to understand. And sometimes because of emotion, difficult to accept. But it is at the heart of what it means to be an American, and it is why this city with respect and tolerance and good cheer also celebrates the Gay Pride parade, why we are home to the Gay Games."
Republican strategists say Mr. Giuliani's welcome of the Gay Games is very likely to sit poorly with some of his core supporters, but not drive them from his camp. After all, George Marlin, the Conservative candidate for Mayor, who ran to the right of Mr. Giuliani in last year's mayoral race drew less than 1 percent of the vote.
"The reservoir of good will and credibility that Rudy Giuliani has with his base is such that no single event, certainly not this one, is likely to damage it in any substantial way," said Jay Severin, a Republican political strategist.
But whether his appearance at the Gay Games can expand his political base among gay people is also unclear.
"There are people who will support his presence and people who will boo him," said Ann Northrop, one of the board members of the Gay Games and a member of Act Up. "And I don't think anyone's opinion will be affected by the fact he's there." City Councilman Thomas K. Duane, who is gay, called the Mayor's appearance "a good grade on his report card, but he mostly still has a lot of incompletes."
In his interview in The Advocate, Mr. Giuliani spoke out for an inclusive Republican party, saying, "There is no reason why the party shouldn't appeal to gays and lesbians in the same way it does to all Americans."
He criticized the anti-abortion, anti-homosexual oratory of Patrick J. Buchanan at the 1992 Republican National Convention as a mistake and held up Gov. William Weld of Massachusetts as a model of more tolerant Republicanism.
And yesterday he noted that he believed in a Republicanism that preaches an economic philosophy of limited government. If Republicans "were consistent -- and some are and some aren't," he said, "then they'd come to the same view about someone's sexual orientation or sexual preferences, that this is not something the government was designed to get deeply involved in."

HEADLINE: Reluctantly, Mayor Lets Tennis Deal Go Through

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

 BODY:
After complaining before and after the mayoral election about the deal that the administration of David N. Dinkins negotiated to expand the National Tennis Center in Queens, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has agreed, with no public notice, to approve the lease for the expansion.
Mayor Giuliani had suggested after taking office that he would try to find a way to squash the deal, which will keep the United States Open tennis tournament in New York until at least the year 2020.
 
 But a review of the contract ordered by the Mayor has concluded that there is no basis to challenge the lease with the United States Tennis Association, which holds the tournament at the center in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park each summer.
The Mayor told the group of his decision this week. "It's a contract agreement, and we're going to abide by it," Paul A. Crotty, the city's Corporation Counsel, said yesterday.
Mr. Giuliani had often criticized parts of the deal reached by Mr. Dinkins, especially a requirement that the city pay fines up to $325,000 if planes from La Guardia Airport disrupt matches during the tournament.
 
42 Acres of Parkland
 But Mr. Dinkins, an avid tennis player who attends the United States Open each year, finished the contract in the waning days of his administration, calling it "the best deal for a municipal stadium in the nation."
Under the agreement, the association will receive an added 21 acres of parkland, doubling the size of the tennis center to 42 acres, and will get city help in financing its expansion. In exchange, it will pay for the $172 million expansion, including a new stadium with 23,000 seats and renovation of the existing arenas. In addition, the association promised to keep the prestigious tournament in New York City for at least a quarter century and possibly as long as 99 years.
The association also agreed to maintain the center, although the city will continue to own it. In addition, the association will pay the city $400,000 a year in rent and 1 percent of all revenues over $25 million.
The expansion of the center won broad support from elected officials in the city, but some officials and residents in Queens objected to the deal as a sweetheart package for the tennis association at the expense of open space and quiet skies.
 
'What Fools We Were'
 State Senator Emanuel R. Gold, a Democrat from Forest Hills who has been one of the deal's most forceful critics, expressed disappointment yesterday that the Mayor had not found a way to reopen negotiations.
He called the deal a "bonanza" for the tennis association that for example did not include an increase in base rent over the life of the contract.
"We're all at some point -- eight or nine or ten years from now -- going to say what fools we were," Mr. Gold said. "Now we're stuck with it."
Mr. Crotty said the Mayor's office reviewed three areas of the agreement: the loss of parkland, the economics of the deal and the possible fines the city would have to pay if airplanes disrupt matches, even though the city cannot dictate air traffic, which is controlled by the Federal Aviation Administration.
The Mayor objected to the provision for fines because the "city could be penalized even when it's done all it can do," Mr. Crotty said. The Mayor's office asked the association to consider changing the provision on fines, offering some form of financial bonus other than fines, Mr. Crotty said.
But the association refused, and the Mayor's office relented this week. The decision not to challenge the lease further was first reported in The Daily News on Thursday.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Gold Jumps $6.20 as Prices Of Oil and Other Basics Rise

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Gold prices surged yesterday as traders became increasingly concerned that sharply higher prices for oil and other commodities would increase inflationary pressures in the economy.
At the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for August delivery jumped $6.20, to $393.70 an ounce, the metal's highest price since late March. 
 "Everybody was watching the Commodity Research Bureau index and soybeans and crude oil were higher, fanning the fears of inflation," said Jon Nader, a vice president of the Bank of America.
The index of 21 commodities rose 2.10 points, to close at 239.38, its highest point in more than three and a half years.
"The C.R.B. is everybody's heart index," said John O'Connell, an analyst for Refco Inc. in New York. "The bottom line is there's so much going on that finally funds are turning to gold. They own beans, they own coffee. They see that the market is still bullish on commodities, so why not go to gold."
Other precious metals also posted sharp gains. July silver rose 13.3 cents, to $5.593 an ounce on the Comex. July platinum gained $5.20, to $411.10 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 
Oil Prices Over $20
 Also on the Mercantile Exchange, crude oil prices surged above $20 a barrel, pushing gasoline prices higher.
"We're hitting highs we haven't seen in over a year," Bob Baker, an energy analyst with Prudential Securities Inc. in New York, said of crude oil futures. "There was no new news today or yesterday but the market seems to feel that OPEC has an agreement that's good for oil prices."
Meeting earlier this week in Vienna, OPEC ministers decided to keep oil production unchanged throughout the year.
July crude oil soared 80 cents, to $20.71 a barrel, a 14-month high. Unleaded gasoline gained 1.73 cent, to 55.20 cents a gallon, and heating oil rose 1.50 cents, to 52.02 cents a gallon.
Elsewhere, corn and soybean prices continued to climb in reaction to the hot, dry weather in the Midwest. On the Chicago Board of Trade, July corn was 1 1/2 cents higher at $2.83 1/4 a bushel, while July soybeans were up 9 1/2 cents at $7.11 a bushel.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar, Still on a Slide, Hits 8-Month Low Against Mark

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The slide in the dollar worsened yesterday as it hit an eight-month low against the German mark. It also dropped to its weakest level in a year and a half against the Swiss franc.
The dollar's latest drop did not appear to be based on any significant news or economic data, but it unnerved other financial markets, pulling down bond and stock prices. 
 Traders said the currency's weakness reflected a foreign exchange market test to see how far the dollar must fall before the Clinton Administration would support it. Analysts said the market was doubting the strength of the American economy and the Administration's currency policies, while focusing on gaps between German and American interest rates that were pulling capital away from the United States and weakening the dollar.
In late New York trading, the dollar dropped more than two pfennigs, to 1.6105 German marks, from 1.6334 marks on Thursday. It also hit 1.3545 Swiss francs, down from 1.3700. Moreover, it also relinquished all of Thursday's gains against the Japanese yen, falling to 102.70 from 103.45.
Currency trading was quiet through the morning, with no releases of new Government data on the economy, as the dollar drifted below 1.6280 marks, seen by dealers as a key technical support level. But the dollar plunged around midday after Gail Fosler, chief economist for the Conference Board business research group in New York, predicted that the dollar would fall 10 percent against the mark in the next 18 months.
Ms. Fosler based the forecast, which was carried on several news services, on economic fundamentals, including lower inflation and higher interest rates in Germany.
"The headlines and the thrust of the story pulled the rug out from under the dollar," said Bob Near, a vice president at the Bank of New York.
But many analysts said traders had taken Ms. Fosler's report as an excuse to sell dollars, pointing to an underlining lack of confidence in the currency.
"The markets don't generally respond to this kind of thing," said Lisa Finstrom, currency analyst for Smith Barney & Company. "It hit a vulnerable market. In thin trading, everybody rushed for the door. It just greased the wheels of something already in motion, that is, a generalized dollar retreat."
John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers, said the decline was simply an extension of a weeks-old slide for the dollar, set off by doubts about the strength of the American economy and expectations of pickups in Europe and Japan.
In recent days, Mr. Lipsky added, the market has started to test the Clinton Administration's resolve to continue the change toward a dollar-supporting policy that started with an enormous currency-market intervention in early May, when the dollar was approaching postwar lows.
"The pressure on the dollar is unlikely to be resolved without another round of intervention," he said.

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
Discount Brokers: The Cheap Get Cheaper

BYLINE: By Francis Flaherty 

 BODY:
Price battles are breaking out in the deep-discount broker business, leaving some firms shell-shocked, some on the attack and some posing as noncombatants. Through all the smoke, savvy investors will discern one thing: the spoils of war.
 The first shot was fired in January by National Discount Brokers, based in New York. A new subsidiary of the Sherwood Group, an investment and research firm with $80 million in 1993 sales, National heavily advertised a flat fee of $30 a trade, topped by a $3 handling charge. The fee applied to all over-the-counter trades and to trades of fewer than 5,000 shares of listed stocks. For larger listed deals, the firm tacked on a penny a share on the whole order. 
 The $33 fee undercut many discounters, particularly on larger trades. The industry's average fee for trading 1,000 shares of a $5 stock was $72 last year, according to the American Association of Individual Investors.
 National's debut -- plus a skittish stock market that may slow the broker business -- has prompted "aggressive competition" among deep discounters, said Mark D. Coler, president of Mercer Inc., a New York research firm.
 "It's like a gas war, with a station on each corner and a new price every day," said Kenneth Kraska, president of the R. J. Forbes Group, a deep- discount broker in Melville, L.I.
 For investors, the benefits extend beyond falling prices to flat fees that vastly simplify the search for the least expensive deep-discount broker. And, while service counts, too, price is of high importance in this economy-minded industry.
 Several of these very cheap brokers -- who handle about 20 percent of a discount market dominated by Charles Schwab, Fidelity and Quick & Reilly -- have sharply dropped their minimum transaction fee, which is the lowest price charged regardless of trade size. On April 1, Forbes dropped its minimum from $45 to $35, and a month later, E-Trade, a computer-only discounter in Palo Alto, Calif., reduced its minimum from $35 to $25.
 These fee reductions, at 22 percent and 28 percent, are big bites. And shrinking minimums are just one front in the war.
 Brown & Company, a large deep discounter based in Boston, used to charge $25 plus 3 cents a share for trading listed stocks, and $25 and 2 cents a share for unlisted ones. As of June 1, the fee is a flat $29, for listed and unlisted trades, up to 5,000 shares. To trade 1,000 shares of a listed equity, Brown will now get $29, not $55 -- a 47 percent drop.
 Do the cuts hurt the brokers? "Anybody who says they like competition is a liar," said George Brown, president of the company bearing his name.
 At Fidelity's Spartan Brokerage, trading 500 shares at $50 cost $64 until yesterday. Now, the Boston-based discounter charges $55 -- a 14 percent difference. These percentage savings vary with trade size, even within the same company.
 The guy who set the fire is feeling the heat, too. Two days after Brown moved to $29, National dropped its price for unlisted trades from $30 to $25 -- and dispensed with the $3 handling charge.
 Prices are getting simpler as well as lower. Traditionally, discounters use intricate fee formulas that include many aspects of a trade -- share number, dollar value, share price. But some discounters, reacting to National's opening salvo, are adopting flat fees.
 For listed stocks at E-Trade and National, and for listed and unlisted stocks at Brown, the new flat fees cover all trades of fewer than 5,000 shares. And for unlisted trades at National, E-Trade and Forbes, the sky's the limit. "You can do a billion shares" at the flat rate, said Mr. Kraska of Forbes.
 Of course, as its rivals hasten to point out, National did not invent the flat fee. Many discounters use per-share prices, usually 1 to 3 cents, subject to overall deal minimums. Combined, these features act as a flat fee.
 At 2 cents a share and a $34 transaction minimum, investors at Lombard Institutional Brokerage, based in San Francisco, will pay an effective flat rate of $34 for all trades of listed stocks between 1 and 1,700 shares.
 However, given the range of minimums and per-share charges, these formulas usually operate as flat fees only up to about 2,300 shares, and often fewer. The new, National-inspired flat rates simplify much larger trades.
 Clarity is coming elsewhere, too. At Spartan, the old fee schedule had 28 pages listing 1,400 transactions. The new one needs just a few phrases: $40 plus 3 cents a share for trades under 5,000 shares, and $40 plus 2 cents a share for trades over 5,000 shares. All subject to a $45 minimum.
 For investors, this simplicity may have more value than falling prices. With straightforward fees, they can find the cheapest broker without laborious calculation. And who the cheapest broker is will change much less with trade size.
 But the new pricing at Spartan won't help all investors equally. "People who trade in large amounts get a bigger discount" under the new fees, said Donna Morris, a Fidelity senior vice president. Some smaller traders may even pay more under the new method, and small trades are broadly defined.
 Trading 300 shares at $30 -- a $9,000 deal -- costs $44 under the old system, and $49 under the new. Spartan further segments the market by requiring 40 trades a year and an account minimum of $20,000.
 Similarly, investors may like National's $25 flat fee for over-the-counter trades, but, for listed trades, they may find a better deal than its $33 fee. (Why the $8 difference? Because National can execute unlisted orders in-house through an affiliate, Sherwood Securities.)
 Investor wariness will still pay off, too. Lombard's $34 minimum may look cheaper than Forbes's $35. But Lombard has a $2.50 handling charge. Forbes has none.
 And brokers quickly remind salivating investors that service still counts. "If it were all about price, we'd all have Yugos," said Lombard's president, V. Eric Roach. Lombard offers such benefits as real-time stock prices and a ratio of one customer-service person for every two brokers.
 Ms. Morris likes service, too. Spartan may cost more than some, but it is "a service-intensive deep-discount broker" that is open around the clock and has Fidelity's big resources behind it.
 Computer and telephone trading, no-load mutual fund investing and interest payments on cash balances are other valuable services some discounters provide.
 But lower prices, not service, are today's news. Will they be tomorrow's? "I think we'll see more," Mr. Brown said.
 Large players like Brown and National may fear this prospect. But small ones are even grimmer. "We're fine now," Mr. Kraska said. "But I can't see going any lower."

HEADLINE: FUNDS WATCH;
Combining Varied Stock-Picking Styles

BYLINE: By Carole Gould 

 BODY:
The New England Star Advisers Funduses leading money managers from four fund groups to manage an equity portfolio. They are William M. B. Berger and Rodney L. Linafelter of Berger 100; Edward F. Keely, Founders Growth; Warren B. Lammert, Janus Mercury, and Barbara C. Friedman and Jeffrey C. Petherick, Loomis Sayles Small Cap. The idea of combining equity managers with different stock-picking styles is great for diversification. But with a load of 5.75 percent, the price is steep. You can re-create the same fund at no charge, using a discount brokerage account to minimize paperwork.
The growing reluctance of investors to pay sales charges has inspired several fund groups with excellent track records to convert to no-loads. The latest example is Heartland, known primarily for its top-performing Value and U.S. Government Securities funds. The group dropped its 3 percent sales charge June 1. 
 The Alliance Worldwide Privatization Fund aims for long-term capital appreciation by buying shares of former state-owned companies. Its allocation is slightly different from the Global Privatization Fund, a closed-end fund recently started by Alliance. To gain the needed liquidity, the open-end fund will invest roughly 70 percent in established economies, mostly in Western Europe. Its closed-end cousin invests about 60 percent there, and is now selling for a discount -- a tempting bargain.

HEADLINE: World Cup '94;
Defending Its Title, Germany Slips by Bolivia

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, June 17

 BODY:
They came by the thousands, Bolivians blowing whistles and carrying oversized flags, Germans beating drums and dancing in conga lines, Americans trying to plug into this unfamiliar festive celebration.
The World Cup arrived here today with the first of 52 games, but the locals still have much to learn about football played with the feet instead of the hands. Oprah Winfrey, the emcee for the opening ceremonies, fell off a platform just after she welcomed a worldwide audience of 750 million television viewers to Soldier Field and appeared to twist an ankle. Then Diana Ross skipped down the slick turf lip-synching a song, kicked a waiting soccer ball and missed the net wide left. 
 Germany, the defending champion, using three forwards, also botched its share of scoring chances, but still dominated for a 1-0 victory over Bolivia with a goal that conformed with the new, relaxed offside rule in international soccer.
The match was played before 63,117 spectators and 63,117 bottles of sunscreen under a cloudless sky; the temperature breached 90 degrees on the field. At one point, both teams simply stopped playing in the second half and went to the sideline, where they were handed bottles of water, lest the players melt into a puddle like the Wicked Witch of the West.
The lone goal came in the 61st minute when Germany's Lothar Matthaus, who has switched from midfield to sweeper, chipped a long pass from near midfield and the Bolivian defense pushed forward, apparently attempting an offside trap. Instead, the Bolivians found themselves snared in a new rule designed to increase scoring after an inelegant World Cup four years ago in Italy.
According to the new offside rule, an offensive player can be positioned even with the last defender when a pass is made to him. Previously, the offensive player had to be stationed in front of the last defender to remain onside. Referees have been instructed not call offside unless they are certain the rule has violated.
Matthaus's teammates Thomas Hassler and Jurgen Klinsmann waited under the pop-fly pass like center fielders as the Bolivians moved forward. Four years ago, offside undoubtedly would have been called. Today, Referee Arturo Brizio Carter of Mexico swallowed his whistle.
Standing outside the penalty box, Hassler brilliantly deflected the pass with his chest to a waiting Klinsmann, Germany's star striker. Bolivian goalkeeper Carlos Trucco made a desperate foray upfield, but he was left stranded and Klinsmann simply had to punch the ball into an empty goal.
"Once I got the ball, there was almost nothing I could do wrong," Klinsmann said.
Xabier Azkargorta, the Basque doctor who is Bolivia's coach, said he thought offside should have been called and that Hassler had appeared to touch the ball with a forbidden hand. Naturally, Berti Vogts, the German coach, saw nothing resembling offside.
"The referee followed the new instructions to the letter," Vogts said.
The defeat spoiled Bolivia's first appearance in the World Cup since 1950. Eight thousand Bolivians traveled to Chicago from one of Latin America's poorest country for today's game, using soccer to promote a nascent democracy and economic equilibrium.
"This is our chance to overcome our loser mentality," said Ricardo Pereyra, 29, who works for the Bolivian national chamber of commerce. "This is the most historic day in this century for our country."
 
'A Universal Language'
 President Clinton attended the game and greeted Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozado, as well as German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, proclaiming that "the love of soccer is a universal language that binds us all together." But it was clear from the beginning Germany had not only love, but the discipline and precision to prevail.
Given the unfamiliarity of soccer to most Americans, organizers used the country's most familiar host, Winfrey, to welcome the game to the United States. She recovered quickly from her spill to emcee a tasteful pregame show that featured a parade of the national costumes of the 24 participating nations. Even a cacophony of fireworks could not distract spectators for long from the oppressive heat, which Klinsmann, the German star called "brutal."
 
Etcheverry Sent Off
 With one final attempt to equalize the score, Bolivia sent its star striker, Marco (El Diablo, the Devil) Etcheverry, onto the field with 11 minutes remaining. Etcheverry suffered a severe knee injury last fall and has not recovered sufficiently to play a full game. Today, four minutes after he entered the game he was ejected for kicking at Matthaus after the German sweeper had leveled Etcheverry with an elbow. Bolivia then had to play with 10 men. Etcheverry is suspended for Bolivia's next game, Thursday against South Korea.
"I went in and I was nervous; these things happen," Etcheverry said. "I'm sorry to Bolivia. If I did kick him, it's part of the game."
Whatever the heat had not sapped from Bolivia's determination, Etcheverry's red card did.

HEADLINE: Graduate Students Give Grades a Boost

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Making the Grades" (editorial June 5) identifies causes of college grade inflation, including promotion of student self-esteem, professors who are reluctant to make waves and administrators who want to satisfy the customers. But you omit one reason of major proportions. 
 At many universities, grading in most undergraduate lecture courses is done not by the professors, but by graduate students.
Lacking in experience and preoccupied with their own studies, these graders are often even more reluctant than professors to face indignant recipients of C's, D's or F's. The temptation is therefore strong to follow the path of least resistance by awarding inflated grades.
Professors can guard against this academic hazard by engaging themselves in grading sufficiently to insure that grades in their courses reflect their own standards and by dealing with student complaints themselves, instead of leaving them to graders.

HEADLINE: Church, in an Era of Change, Is Misunderstood;
Women in Priesthood

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Pope John Paul II's statement that "the church has no authority whatsoever to confer priestly ordination on women" is an admission of impotence unacceptable to many devoted Catholics. That statement, of course, bespeaks the papal posture, reflecting his wisdom and will on the topic. 
 "To the Altar," Anna Quindlen's June 4 column, offers another wisdom: Many women are serving as priests without benefit of sacramental ordination and without the common titles. Sister Virginia Welsh, she observes, is pastoring a Roman Catholic parish in Ohio, but with the title of "pastoral administrator." Similar positions are held elsewhere. Many parishes in New York City have women in charge of pastoral programs. They minister directly to people with profound needs -- the impoverished, abandoned, abused, unemployed and homebound elderly, and they do this with exquisite determination and tenderness.
Without official recognition, they are spending their lives in "imago Dei," the image of God.
In their personalized caring for people, they hear confessions, but cannot give sacramental absolution. Although many work to beautify the mass, they do not preside in public.
The "church" that the Pope sees from his seat at the Vatican may not seem able to ordain women. The church in many other places would have little difficulty in so doing. It is from the traditional domain of the Holy Spirit known as "sensus fidelium" that affirmation comes. The sense of the faithful has engendered other changes thought unacceptable by other pontiffs.
What is ominous within the Pope's statement is the condemnation of discussion. For the women who believe God is calling them to priesthood, silence is not acceptable. The command to be silent is a command to be unfaithful both to call and conscience. This conversation must continue.

HEADLINE: Q & A

BYLINE: By Leonard Sloane

 BODY:

Nonprofit Beneficiary
Q. If a nonprofit organization is the beneficiary of an individual retirement account or a Keogh account, must the organization pay taxes on the proceeds?
C. RICHARD BECKER, Manhattan
 
A. When a tax-exempt organization is the beneficiary of an I.R.A., the distribution is taxable in the same manner as if it had been made to the deceased owner.
 But when a tax-exempt organization receives a Keogh account, some portions may not be taxable, depending on several factors, including the participant's nondeductible contributions.
 "A nonprofit beneficiary of a Keogh account may be able to use special tax treatments for lump-sum distributions, such as five-year or 10-year averaging and capital gain treatment," said Ronald L. Noll, head of a Malvern, Pa., accounting firm bearing his name. "And if the distribution is due to the employee's death, the nonprofit organization may be able to treat the payment as a lump-sum distribution, whether or not he or she had five years of participation in the plan."

Medigap Abroad
Q. What are the economics of a medigap policy when retiring to a foreign country?
Anna-Liisa Rintala, Manhattan
 
A. The purpose of a medigap policy, private insurance that supplements Medicare, is to pay costs not covered by the Federal Medicare program. Medicare generally does not cover health services outside the United States, the primary exception being when a hospital in Canada or Mexico is more accessible than an American hospital.
 "Most medigap plans provide some coverage for people who are out of the country on a temporary basis," said Rebecca Moore of the American Association of Retired Persons. "Medigap plans do not offer coverage for people who are living out of the country permanently."

I.R.A. Into Fixed Annuity
Q. Can I transfer an individual retirement account to a fixed annuity so I will not be required to pay taxes until the money is withdrawn?
DORIS BROWN, Manhattan
 
A. Yes, you can. One of the categories of tax-deferred accounts established by the law creating individual retirement accounts is an individual retirement annuity.
 But many financial advisers say you should not switch your I.R.A. into an annuity, because it represents an unnecessary duplication of the tax deferral. Money invested in an I.R.A. grows on a tax-deferred basis, as does money invested in an annuity, explained Avery E. Neumark, a partner of Weber Lipshie & Company, a New York accounting firm. Other types of investments probably make more sense.
 "If you wish to roll your account over," Mr. Neumark said, "you must do so within 60 days of the distribution from the original plan. And only one such rollover may be made in any one-year period."

CORRECTION-DATE: July 2, 1994, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An answer in the Q & A column of the Your Money pages on June 18, for a question about the beneficiaries of individual retirement accounts and Keough accounts, misstated the tax implications for some beneficiaries. A beneficiary that is a tax-exempt organization does not have to pay income taxes on distributions from such accounts.

HEADLINE: 'Looking at the Sun'

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I feel obliged to set the record straight about F. M. Scherer's comments on my book "Looking at the Sun: The Rise of the New East Asian Economic and Political System" (May 8). 
 A reader of this review would have little idea what the book concerned, since Mr. Scherer devoted most of his comments to factual quibbles with three or four pages of the book. The points he makes would not be worth resurrecting except that his "corrections" to my argument are wrong.
Mr. Scherer says that I exaggerate in claiming that Japan had "virtually no semiconductor industry in 1970." In the book, this comes at the end of a long section detailing what Japan had accomplished in semiconductors by 1970. It will be obvious to any reader that it is meant to highlight how much more Japan achieved afterward. Mr. Scherer says, moreover, that the discoveries of the Japanese scientist Leo Esaki demonstrate Japan's pioneering efforts in the semiconductor business. He does not point out that Mr. Esaki spent virtually his whole professional life (1960 through 1992) working in the United States, for I.B.M., precisely because Japanese companies offered such limited opportunities early in his career.
Mr. Scherer says that I exaggerate in claiming that economists believe "there can never be too much competition in a market." The sentences immediately before and after this one make clear that it is being presented as an overstated, straw-man view. For instance, the next sentence says, "In practice everyone recognizes the limits of these theories."
Mr. Scherer says that I err in dating a memory-chip shortage to 1985, rather than 1988. My book says, accurately, that the shortage occurred in 1988 but that the first warnings of it came in 1985.
None of these points is of real importance, and yet they were the only issues Mr. Scherer chose to deal with in his review. The larger question is why a reviewer would concentrate on minor issues and neglect to say anything about the main arguments in a very long book. The explanation may lie in the book's fundamental point: that economic theories are the wrong tools to use for understanding modern Asia's development. Instead, the book says, we should emphasize the effect of Asia's history and the realities of daily life there. Mr. Scherer is an economic theorist who (as he states in the review) knows very little about Asia's history or current realities. That he would disagree with the book is not surprising; why he would be considered the right reviewer is harder to say.
 
JAMES FALLOWS
Washington
 
F. M. Scherer replies:
The first quarter of my review summarized James Fallows's main argument; the remainder was critical. My "factual quibbles," all supportable in a longer reply, were illustrative. Numerous similar but unreported quibbles underlay my central point: that Mr. Fallows characterizes simplistically and inaccurately what real-world economic analyses teach and the semiconductor industry's history. One cannot formulate sound economic policy on the basis of a travelogue, however fascinating.
My review was not so modest as to state that I know very little about Asia's history or current realities. It said that I was an infrequent traveler to Asia. Building upon high-technology industry research extending back to 1958, I have followed (and taught and written about) Japanese industrial development with intense interest since my first interviews with companies there in 1973. To paraphrase Yogi Berra, if you understand the game, looking even from a distance, you can see a lot.

 BODY:
FATHERHOOD IN AMERICA: A History
By Robert L. Griswold. Basic Books, $13.
The author documents the evolving role of fathers, from the aloof disciplinarian of earlier days to the nurturing New Age dad. Interestingly, demographic trends have resulted in fewer opportunities for male parenting just at a time when it has also gained status. Mr. Griswold "persuasively charts all sorts of attitudinal changes," Michael Kammen said here last year. 

THE LYING DAYS
By Nadine Gordimer. Penguin, $10.95.
Originally published in 1953, this Nobel Prize-winning author's first novel, written in the first person, focuses on the adolescent experiences of a white South African girl and her growing awareness of racial injustice. The New York Times's reviewer, James Stern, called it "as original and as beautifully written as a novel by Virginia Woolf." Penguin has also reissued Ms. Gordimer's OCCASION FOR LOVING ($10.95), a novel that revolves around the illicit love affair between an upper-class married white woman and a black South African painter. Their story is "a painfully clear mirror for the brutalities" surrounding them, Martin Levin said here in 1963.
AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS:
The Inside Story of the End of the Cold War
By Michael R. Beschloss and Strobe Talbott.
Back Bay/Little Brown, $12.95.
The authors analyze the relationships among the top officials in the United States and the Soviet Union between 1989 and 1991, arguing that President George Bush supported Mikail S. Gorbachev for too long and Boris N. Yeltsin not soon enough. Last year our reviewer, Godfrey Hodgson, called the book "a useful and readable account." THE UNITED STATES AND THE END OF THE COLD WAR: Implications, Reconsiderations, Provocations, by John Lewis Gaddis (Oxford University, $11.95), presents the postwar period as actually a time of great peace, and indicates the challenges the future presents. The author's "skill . . . is a quality we need much more of," Alan Tonelson said here in 1992.
THE PROFESSOR OF DESIRE
By Philip Roth. Vintage International, $10.
Just restored to print, this novel concerns the romantic adventures of David Kepesh, teacher of literature. His experiences demonstrate that desire and happiness, though powerfully linked, rarely coexist. In 1977 our reviewer, Vance Bourjaily, described it as "a fine display of literary skills . . . moving when it needs to be."
THE NEANDERTALS: Of Skeletons, Scientists, and Scandal
By Erik Trinkaus and Pat Shipman. Vintage, $15.
The prehuman Neanderthals -- and their ultimate contributions to modern man -- have been the subject of endless debate. These scholars assert that they were actually closer to us, in genes and temperament, than is usually supposed. The book offers a "detailed historical perspective," Malcolm W. Browne said here last year.
THE VIRGIN SUICIDES
By Jeffrey Eugenides. Warner, $10.99.
Several men describe their lifelong obsession with five young women, the Lisbon sisters of Grosse Pointe, Mich., whose sexually repressive Roman Catholic household drove the girls to suicidal extremes. Last year our reviewer, Suzanne Berne, said, "Mr. Eugenides is blessed with the storyteller's most magical gift."
NEW YORK, NEW YORK: How the Apartment House
Transformed the Life of the City (1869-1930)
By Elizabeth Hawes. Owl/Holt, $16.95.
Every New Yorker knows that his city is unlike anywhere else in the United States, but this book explains why: the advent of high-rise living, which helped boost the metropolis's economic fortunes. The author is "an engaging stylist," Kenneth T. Jackson said here last year. The fate of a New York commercial building is discussed in HIGH RISE: How 1,000 Men and Women Worked Around the Clock for Five Years and Lost $200 Million Building a Skyscraper, by Jerry Adler (Harper Perennial, $13). At issue is the developer Ian Bruce Eichner's creation of 1540 Broadway (now the Bertelsmann Building). Last year our reviewer, David W. Dunlap, called the book "a valuable postscript to the latest boom-and-bust cycle." Just as synonymous with Manhattan as the skyscraper is its one island of green, the subject of THE PARK AND THE PEOPLE: A History of Central Park, by Roy Rosenzweig and Elizabeth Blackmar (Owl/Holt, $19.95). The authors argue that the landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted deserves less credit for the park than the workers and common citizens who remolded its uses. The result is "a deeply felt celebration," Robert Fishman said here in 1992.
A CALCULATED RISK
By Katherine Neville. Ballantine, $5.99.
Verity Banks, an aptly named heroine, decides to teach her ungrateful employers at the Bank of the World a lesson by showing them just how easily their computer system can be sabotaged. In 1992 our reviewer, Newgate Callendar, said her adventure "churns up wave after wave of excitement."
THE CHILD GARDEN: Or, A Low Comedy
By Geoff Ryman. Orb/Tom Doherty Associates, $13.95.
This science fiction novel by the author of "Was" imagines a future filled with virus-induced learning, genetic engineering and early death. Milena Shibush puts her stamp on this world, and in doing so, "painfully and even heroically matures," Gerald Jonas said here in 1990.
FOLLY
By Susan Minot. Washington Square/Pocket Books, $10.
The two decades following the outbreak of World War I are the setting for this novel, which explores the thwarted passions of upper-crust Bostonians who let propriety rule over their hearts. In 1992 our reviewer, Anthony Bailey, described it as "a smartly written book."

When a Prussian King Played Decorator

BYLINE: By RITA REIF 

 BODY:
CAST-IRON OBJECTS WERE never glamorous -- even when they were new at the beginning of the 19th century. So King Friedrich Wilhelm III of Prussia decided he would try to make his nation, if not rich, at least solvent by encouraging their sale. An assortment of the weighty trinkets was prominently installed in a parlor in one of his Potsdam palaces. No one knows which pieces he chose or how long the room was left intact. But the style remained popular in decorating for decades, the iron foundries flourished, and production spread throughout Central Europe.
Today such exquisitely detailed matte-black objects are little in fashion beyond the borders of where they were produced, in the lands now known as Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia. Many gimmicky if charming curiosities abound among the diverse artifacts assembled in "Cast Iron From Central Europe, 1800-1850," an exhibition at the Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts in Manhattan, through Aug. 7. 
 Based in part on a smaller show presented in 1992 by the Austrian Museum of Applied Arts in Vienna, the Bard exhibition was organized by Elisabeth Schmuttermeier, curator of metalwork at the Austrian museum, and Derek Ostergard, dean of the Bard Graduate Center. While the majority of the objects are from Vienna, 80 were lent by the Birmingham Museum of Art in Alabama.
The show's 230 items -- chairs, tables, candlesticks, incense burners, jewelry, clocks, desk accessories, fans, buttons, pincushions and perfume-bottle holders -- were designed to appeal to the growing middle class. Absent from this show are more utilitarian iron articles -- pots, pans and stoves -- that were made in volume at the same time elsewhere and have never gone out of style.
Why, then, did cast-iron objects multiply in some but not all of the ore-rich regions of continental Europe?
For one thing, says Mr. Ostergard, the Prussian and Austrian rulers gave iron a political spin. Crippled by Napoleon's 1806 victory over the Prussian army and the seven-year occupation by French forces that followed, Prussia under Friedrich Wilhelm began to fight back on the economic front. In 1813, the King urged his people to end Napoleonic oppression by exchanging their gold, silver and other precious materials for ornamental cast iron, donating their valuables to the fatherland.
The response was overwhelming: in Berlin alone, 160,000 rings were turned in and exchanged for cast-iron ones suitably engraved "I gave gold for iron." And during the Wars of Liberation that ended in 1815, blackened iron statuary replaced many bronzes in the public monuments of Berlin, thanks mostly to the efforts of Karl Friedrich Shinkel, the German architect.
During the period, nationalist fervor surged and was even seen on the postcard-size cast-iron plaques depicting German military heroes or town scenes that were the New Year's greeting cards of the time. While nostalgia seems to have inspired the night light shaped like a miniature Gothic tower, the inkstands cast in the forms of a sleeping cherub, Shakespeare's Falstaff or Napoleon's tomb are examples of early German kitsch. When a design is superbly wrought, as is the potted iron sunflower with realistically veined and bent leaves, its outmoded purpose as a watch holder seems anything but trivial.
AN OUTGROWTH OF THE innovative technology that had spearheaded the Industrial Revolution in the 18th century in Britain, the cast-iron style took many forms. The English, French and Russians concentrated on engineering marvels -- bridges, tunnels, pavilions, gates and railroad fittings -- limiting the production of smaller items to stoves and hardware.
Nevertheless, the look of the Central European iron objects exhibited at Bard owes much to another late-18th-century British development -- Josiah Wedgwood's basaltlike ceramics. To match them, the gray metal was given an ink-black flat finish, which became standard for all cast-iron artifacts.
In fact, basalt-toned busts of German rulers or writers decorated table tops, lacy black metal tiaras and necklaces were worn to balls, and candlesticks the color of tar were seen everywhere in homes. Not the least of the attractions of these decorations, with their vaguely funereal look, was thrift: they represented good design at a moderate price.
Mr. Ostergard cites another reason: "Cast iron was probably more appropriate in German interiors, because they were not as opulently colored as those in Britain and France," he says.
"Then, its simplicity and heaviness, which were part of its basic appeal, caused its demise. Groups of iron objects certainly seem somber, which may have quickened the style's end by mid-century."
Today, cast iron is enthusiastically collected in Central Europe. And reproductions are sold in the gift shops of German museums, a development Mr. Ostergard applauds. "Anything that was good the first time around," he says, "can be good again."

HEADLINE: Brazil Inflation

 BODY:
To the Editor: We returned in March from three weeks in Brazil. Travelers should be aware of the chaotic situation of the currency. The official rate of inflation exceeded 40 percent in February, and the exchange rate of the dollar more or less follows inflation, climbing 1 or 2 percent daily. As a result it becomes necessary to change money daily. Another consequence is that many stores, hotels and restaurants do not accept credit cards. And if they do, they charge a premium of over 40 percent. This makes it necessary to deal in large amounts of cash.
A final difficulty is that not all banks will even change traveler's checks. We found plenty of cambios in Rio and Sao Paulo, but in Florianop olis, a vacation center for Brazilians in the southern state of Santa Catarina, the American Express office was unable to cash its own traveler's checks. 
 Because inflation is so rapid we found that hotel rates were quoted in United States dollars, but were to be paid in Brazilian cruzeiros calculated at the rate of exchange on the day you check out. This meant changing money at the last minute.

HEADLINE: The Lazy, Hazy Vacation-Home Market

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

 BODY:
A WEEKEND house in the Hamptons. A condominium in Vermont. A place at the Jersey Shore. A cabin in Maine. A cottage upstate New York. A country home in Connecticut.
Before the crash of the residential real estate market in the Northeast in the late 80's, a second home was often considered an affordable luxury among the affluent and a not unreachable dream for many in the middle class. 
 Since then, a weak economy, demographic trends, changing tastes and new tax laws have depressed much of the second-home market in the Northeast.
To be sure, many brokers report sales slightly ahead of last year's pace, in part because of the recent increase in interest rates and a fear among prospective buyers that rates will continue to rise.
Inventories, however, are still high in many popular locales, and home construction is only a fraction of what it was a decade ago. Sale prices are also, in many cases, flat or falling, especially for properties in the middle of the market, the $200,000 to $400,000 range. In many places, they remain about 30 percent off their 1987 highs.
"We have had a lot of lookers, but no takers," said Scott Hutchins of Rhinebeck, N.Y., who this summer reduced the price on his three-bedroom Dutch colonial home on three-quarters of an acre to $204,000 from $234,000. "The main issue seems to be money. Someone who buys it has to be able to not only swing a second mortgage, but also pay the maintenance and the taxes."
Such buyers still exist, of course. Joseph and Judith Dirnfeld of the Upper East Side of Manhattan, for example, recently bought a three-bedroom cottage on half an acre in Bridgehampton, L.I., south of Montauk Highway, for $310,000.
The Dirnfelds, however, paid cash. He is a commodities broker; she is an investment banker. "It's a good deal when you compare it with the $60,000 that you would have to pay to rent out here," Ms. Dirnfeld said, referring to the seasonal rate.
Precise sales statistics on second homes are difficult to come by because second homes are defined by use rather than construction. Moreover, the best studies, by the Bureau of the Census and the National Association of Realtors, have not been updated in several years.
For the most part, though, second homes are the domain of wealthy people like the Dirnfelds. While about 65 percent of the nation's households own a primary residence, only about 4 percent own a second home, according to a 1990 report by the National Association of Home Builders, a trade organization in Washington. Further, because of the high cost of land and housing, the Northeast, except for northern New England, has the lowest percentage of second homes in the nation; the Upper Midwest has the most.
"There has been a substantial decline in the rate of construction of second homes and homes for seasonal and occasional use," said Gopahl Ahluwalia, director of research for the National Association of Home Builders. "It fell to about 50,000 a year in 1991 from a high point of 125,000 in the 80's."
Mr. Ahluwalia says that there are about 5.2 million second homes and that they are being built at a current rate of about 75,000 a year. "It is on the upswing somewhat," he said.
Brokers in the New York metropolitan area believe that the dearth of construction will start to reduce the glut of homes on the market. Shrinking inventories will then lead to price increases.
In the meantime, the region's second-home market appears to be, for the most part, in a holding pattern.
"WE are busier than we were in 1992 and 1993, but the pricing is off, probably about 10 percent," said Paul Spera, a real estate agent in Stowe, Vt., and a former regional vice president of the National Association of Realtors.
In the Hamptons, Peter Hallock, president of Allan M. Schneider and Associates in East Hampton, said that the sales volume was higher this year and that prices had climbed back almost to mid-80's levels.
"They are not as extreme as they were in the 80's, but they are high," he said. "In the 80's, prices were inflated, now they are full."
He said that the high end of the market, homes selling for over $1 million, and those at the low end, under $500,000, were moving. Homes priced in between were having more difficulty selling.
Elsewhere, on Cape Cod, a popular vacation home location for Connecticut and New Jersey residents, the average price of a home, $144,419, is 26 percent less than it was five years ago. "Sales are up, prices are down, still declining," said Charles F. Lockhart, executive vice president of the Cape Cod and Islands Board of Realtors in South Yarmouth, Mass. "There has been some new construction going up, though, and that's good to see."
On Long Beach Island, on the Jersey Shore, Jean Luedtke, a manager with HCH Real Estate in Harvey Cedars, said that her company had sold 57 homes in the first four months of 1992 and 61 in 1993, but 53 in the first four months of this year. "The weather was bad," she said. "People couldn't get out of their homes to come down."
She added that the average sale price had probably increased, but only because of the sale of a few high-end properties. "The expensive homes are moving," she said. "We had one listed for $3.85 million in Loveladies, and seven brokers said they had buyers for it."
Much of the decline in the second-home market can be attributed to the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which took away the deductibility for passive losses that had allowed investors to deduct losses from other forms of investments.
Second-home owners can still deduct their mortgage interest and taxes, provided the mortgages don't add up to more than $1 million.
The income is also tax free if the home is rented out for only 14 days or less. If the house is rented for more than 14 days it can be classified as a rental property, which allows deductions -- up to the amount of rental income generated -- for a variety of expenses, including insurance, maintenance, utilities and improvements, during the period when the house is considered a rental.
In the aftermath of the tax change, it was believed that second homes would start to sell briskly again when the Baby Boom generation, whose ranks are now, roughly, people 32 to 48 years old, reached their peak earning years of about 45 to 54 and had young children and teen-agers who would enjoy a beach house or a ski condo.
Though some brokers and demographers are still forecasting this trend, the average second-home buyer in the Northeast since 1992 hasn't been a typical Baby Boomer but, like the Dirnfelds, a DINK -- a couple (usually of Baby Boomer age) but with a double income (usually large) and no kids.
"When we qualify buyers, we find that 80 percent of them are DINKs," Mr. Spera said.
Ms. Luedtke added that her clients rarely include retirees or families with children. "What we are getting are young and middle-aged professional couples without kids who need an escape," she said.
SUCH high-income households, many brokers believe, may be the only ones able to afford a second home in today's cost-conscious economy.
"There is a lack of appetite out there," Mr. Spera said. "People are really assessing whether they want to have a second home or vacation property. The central issue seems to be whether they will have a use for it." "A lot of people say, 'We like it, but will we use it? Why not rent for two weeks?' "
Vacation homes generally rent for $800 to $2,000 a week during the high seasons, although some areas, like the Hamptons, are more expensive.
Mr. Spera said that potential buyers today were balking at paying two mortgages and sometimes three; it is not uncommon to make a down payment on a second home by taking out a second mortgage against the equity in a primary home.
Indeed, for many of these buyers, an additional mortgage makes it difficult to meet the standard for the maximum amount of mortgage debt, relative to income, that is acceptable to a lender. Generally, lenders insist that buyers pay no more than 28 percent of their gross income in total mortgage payments.
Then there are local property taxes, which can cost thousands of dollars a year; utility bills, landscaping and annual repairs.
"People are not jumping back into a highly leveraged household budget," Mr. Spera said. "They are very cautious shoppers."
Lenders are just as leery of the second-home market, so much so that owners often provide financing. With seller financing, the buyer makes a down payment and monthly payments at an agreed-upon interest rate to the seller, not to a bank.
Richard Clow, a financial planner from Berkeley Heights, N.J., recently bought a four-bedroom contemporary home on the bay side of the highway in Harvey Ceders with seller financing. He bought the home for $320,000 with a $70,000 down payment; it had been listed for $500,000.
Mr. Clow and his wife, Susan, a caterer, intend to rent the house during the 12-week summer season at $2,000 to $2,400 a week and use it themselves the rest of the year. Mr. Clow also plans to use the home year-round in about four or five years.
"I anticipate having grandchildren and I think it will be a great place for them to go," he said.
Although he is considering the property for use rather than investment, Mr. Clow also believes that second-home prices have bottomed out.
"I would anticipate getting a 4 percent growth on my investment each year," he added.
Many potential vacation-home buyers these days, however, do not want to go back to the same summer home year after year. They also want to take short three-day and four-day weekend holidays instead of the month-long vacations that second homes accommodate.
ALTHOUGH places within a day's drive remain popular for vacation homes, New Yorkers are increasingly buying second homes outside the Northeast, especially in areas like Florida (Orlando, South Miami Beach, the Keys, the Southwest Coast around Naples) and South Carolina (Hilton Head and Kiawah Islands).
"The average age of someone coming into Naples now is 43, and a lot of them are from New York," said A. J. Fischer, owner of Century 21 AAdvisors in Naples.
Besides the warm weather, a prime attraction is the price of housing. An average two-bedroom condominium unit in Naples, furnished, about six miles from the Gulf of Mexico, costs about $65,000.
"They rent their homes out for $2,000 a month in January and February and use it the rest of the time for long weekends and vacations," Ms. Fischer said.
In the last few years, vacation homes have also become primary residences for people who are self-employed or able to "telecommute." For some, the appeal is moving away from the high housing costs of the city and the suburbs; for others, quality of life is a major factor.
MR. HALLOCK noted that more and more New Yorkers were seeking to make a home in the Hamptons their year-round residence and that, if they did not have to be in the city five days a week, were keeping a small apartment in the city as a second home.
Others plan to keep one residence in a second-home area and make an occasional long commute. "This is more of a trend than anything else I have seen," said Cindy A. White, a broker with Rhinebeck Realty Ltd. in Rhinebeck, N.Y.
"I had two people last week, a graphic artist and a writer, both from New York, who are looking to move up here and commute into the city one or two days a week."

HEADLINE: In the Region/Connecticut;
Subdivisions Make a Comeback After 4-Year Hiatus

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
IN recent months Connecticut developers have been plunging back into the business of building new homes in multi-unit residential communities, ending a hiatus of more than four years.
"At least two dozen subdivisions of 16 to more than 200 units are under construction or breaking ground," said Joanne Carroll, a director of both the Connecticut Association of Home Builders and the parallel national organization. "Developers are picking the best locations in towns with good transportation and good schools." 
 And no one, she added, is building without signed-up buyers in hand.
"It's still a very volatile market," said Sandy Bergin, research supervisor for the state's Department of Housing. Housing permits, accurate to 95 percent of actual starts, were down to 1,955 in April 1994 compared with 2,314 in April 1993 -- the latest available year-to-year figures -- but permits for April this year were up 30.8 percent from March.
Most homes in the new projects are priced from the mid $100,000's to the low $200,000's, competing favorably with resales that frequently require additional fix-up costs. Increases in mortgage interest rates and in the costs of lumber and sheetrock have been reflected in price rises of up to $10,000 a house, shutting out some low-end buyers, but sales are flourishing, particularly in the central part of the state.
The busiest areas, Ms. Carroll said, are Glastonbury, Wallingford, Cheshire, Newington and Milford, where property taxes run from a low of $24 per $1,000 of assessment in Cheshire to a high of $41.80 in Milford.
Two of the largest subdivisions being built, with more than 200 units, are in Milford and Cromwell. Houses and the land under them will be owned and maintained by the buyers, but common outdoor areas will be owned and maintained by a residents' association. Homeowners will pay monthly association fees, and additions or other changes to the homes may be prohibited or subject to approval under association bylaws.
"Milford is one of the hottest housing markets in the state," Ms. Carroll said, because it is at the Fairfield County border of New Haven County and has access to Metro North's commuter railroad and Interstates 95 and 91, the Merritt Parkway and Route 8.
Lexington Green, a 100-acre subdivision, is rising there near I-95 Exit 37, developed by Baker Firestone of Pleasantville, N.Y. Six house plans designed by EDI Architects of New York and Houston range from 1,338 square feet at $161,900 to 2,256 square feet at $209,900. Baker Firestone bought the land and the approved site plan from a former developer in 1993. Since September, when sales began, 110 homes have been sold, mostly to young families and largely from plans. Three furnished models opened in May.
BY 1996 a total of 261 houses will have been built on approximately 8,000-square-foot level lots fanning out from a green. Standard features include great rooms with cathedral ceilings, fireplaces, all appliances except refrigerators; basements, 3 and 4 bedrooms, and 1- or 2-car garages. Air-conditioning and upgrades could bring the price of the largest model to $250,000.
The Cromwell subdivision, under way on the 220-acre grounds of the Tournament Players Golf Club at River Highlands, will have a model open for inspection in August. The exterior of the model was completed in time for the annual Greater Hartford Open, to be played tomorrow through Saturday.
Building homes at golf courses is nothing new -- about 50 private residences surround the Westchester Country Club in Harrison and 24 are off the ninth hole of the Silvermine Golf Club in Norwalk -- but the Cromwell homes will be clustered on an aggregate of 64 acres within the golf course grounds, on knolls overlooking greens or ponds, nestled in wooded areas or set on a cliff with broad views of the Connecticut River and the Meshomasic State Forest beyond.
The complex, River Highlands, will have 202 homes priced from the mid-$200,000's to the high $300,000's. It is being developed jointly by PGA Golf Course Properties, based in the Sawgrass Country Club in Ponte Vedra, Fla., and Daylor River Properties Inc., based in Stamford, a limited partnership headed by Harry and Jerry Day.
"Our market will be empty-nesters, soon-to-be empty-nesters, dual-income couples and some weekend golfers from New York," said Harry Day. Young families generally are put off by the juxtaposition of children and flying golf balls.
Up to 30 percent of buyers are expected to be golfers attracted to the course, ranked No. 3 in Connecticut by Golf Week Magazine. Residents can become full members at a 10 percent discount from a low-five-figure initiation fee, or for a lower sum may become house members and use the dining rooms and clubhouse, or simply exercise their automatic free access to the club's swimming pool and tennis courts. The management of the club declined to give information on dues and other fees.
NINETY-EIGHT units will be detached one-family houses of 2,450 to 3,000 square feet. The rest will be side-by-side duplexes of 1,800 to 2,450 square feet, all air-conditioned, with 2-car garages and decks, and all conforming to three attached and three detached styles designed by the Martin Architectural Group of Philadelphia.
Living rooms and master bedrooms will have large windows and the more spectacular views will be reflected in the house's cost. Fireplaces will be open to living and dining rooms, or dining and family rooms; master bedrooms may be on the first or second floor, kitchens will have up-to-the minute appliances, bathrooms will have Jacuzzis and there will be large dressing-room-closets.
Since 1980, PGA Golf Course Properties, a subsidiary of PGA Tours, based in Ponte Vedra Beach, has built 14 such joint-venture developments with local partners across the country and one in Japan. "Most of them are larger than the one in Cromwell and more expensive," said Vernon Kelly, president of the corporation. Piper Glen in Charlotte, N.C. has 3,000 homes, Sawgrass has almost 4,000.
"These are definitely not starter homes," said Mr. Kelly, noting that "prices at Cromwell are an anomaly because the golf course was already there, with the land available at a good price." The other courses and homes were built together from scratch.
"It's very difficult to pay for land and a golf course purely out of golf revenues," Mr. Kelly said. "You have to have some of the cost assumed by another entity like a developer who can sell houses."
The Daylor partnership bought its land in 1990 for around $3 million but began building the first model home only last month.
"We feel that now is the time to start," said Harry Day. "This project has a five- to eight-year period for completion and we have done exhaustive market studies to identify a special buyer. It's a different horizon than a one-year project for the general market, where you might still want to wait."

HEADLINE: YOUR HOME;
Cutting Costs in A Condo

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS 

 BODY:
JUST as the budgets of so many condominiums and co-ops seem to have been pared to the very marrow to avoid an increase in monthly charges, new ideas are emerging for continued cost savings.
No wonder. Either because they fear for their jobs or the value of their units, residents are becoming as cutthroat as corporate chieftains. "At my conference last year the most heavily attended workshops were the ones on controlling costs," said Mary Ann Rothman, executive director of the Council of New York Cooperatives. 
 The resulting pressure is thus speedily becoming the mother of ingenuity. Ken Budd, editor of the bimonthly magazine of the Community Associations Institute (C.A.I.), the national network of elected officials and professionals working in the community ownership field, recently asked 20 managers around the country for cost-saving ideas. There were so many suggestions that he couldn't find space to use all of them.
Since the most obvious cutbacks have no doubt already been made, the experts suggest starting by re-examining the tried-and-true approach to seemingly fixed costs.
Take insurance, for example. As the senior vice president of Condominium Insurance Specialists of Arlington Heights, Ill., Barbara Wick monitors hundreds of associations. She maintains that certain aspects of coverage viewed for years as sacred -- and therefore rarely tinkered with during any insurance review -- may not be so sacred after all.
Among her favorites is the service-insurance contract on boiler machinery and other mechanical equipment. Routinely renewed year after year, the money might better be spent adding to reserves, says Ms. Wick. Figured over the life of any item, she has estimated that these particular premiums often exceed the cost of replacing components or even the item itself.
Ms. Wick has also noticed that although inflation has been minimal in the construction trades, many insurance companies still routinely add 10 percent a year as an inflation guard for structural coverage.
"What you did 10 years ago may not be needed anymore," she said. To avoid overpayment, an accurate reassessment should instead be made of current replacement costs.
She further warned against carrying a low deductible -- a technique still favored by many associations, she said. While it allows certain repairs to be covered by insurance, she said, it increases the cost of insurance over the long haul because it tempts an association to file claims more often. A high claims history, she said, can then increase premiums even if the carrier is regularly changed.
Conversely, maintaining a higher deductible -- her favored size is $1,000 -- eliminates the temptation to file smaller claims, thus lowering the risk rating of the association in addition to the immediate premium savings.
Itemized lines she recommends dropping for further savings include special coverage for the loss of cash on hand (it rarely happens in large numbers, she contends) and forgery ("if you've got an efficient setup it's virtually impossible.").
A favorite new cost-saving "toy" of James Cachine, senior vice president at Legum & Norman, managing agents of McLean, Va., is a new kind of emergency exit light. It replaces the customary 40-watt bulb normally used to illuminate these exits with an LED fixture that requires only 1.2 watts.
Mr. Cachine figures that the payback on the light, costing around $90 apiece and newly available from most lighting suppliers, takes about three years, assuming an energy savings of $35 per light bulb for each year. The new light bulb never needs replacing, he added, offering further savings in staff time.
In high-rise buildings with central heat, hot water and air-conditioning systems, he recommends the wider use of computer-aided thermostat controls that allow for more accurate and complex temperature changes.
"And don't just stay with the times of day you think are right for turning things up or down," he said. "Experiment." Even a half hour here or there can add up.
If regularly rising utility costs, such as gas, electricity and water, are folded into monthly charges it might also be time to reconsider submetering.
When installed, these meters permit utility costs to be billed separately based on individual use.
"People become far more careful when they have to pay themselves," said Mark Stauffer, a representative at American Meter Sales of Audubon, Pa., a company that sells, installs and maintains submeters and also handles the individual billing needs of its clients. A result, he insists, is normally a drop of about 25 percent in everyone's utility expenditures.
But a capital outlay will be required. On average a water, gas or electric submeter costs about $500 to install, he said, with town house and garden-apartment complexes less costly than high-rise buildings.
Another useful tool is the "Comparative Study of Building Operation Costs" published each year by the Council of New York Cooperatives. It analyzes data from 500 buildings in a format that permits boards to see where their own costs might be re-examined. "Say your fuel bills are out of line," said Ms. Rothman. "You know it's time to look for a leak in the pipes -- or in the delivery."
A multiple-year service contract is a technique favored by Stanley Rothenberg, president of the New Jersey chapter of the C.A.I. He recommends them for such services as lawn mowing and landscaping.
At Cross Creek, a 339-unit condominium on 35 acres in Englewood, N.J., he said he held the line on further increases for the next three years by signing a three-year agreement. "After what we paid last winter it made sense," said Mr. Rothenberg, who is also executive vice president at C & R Realty and Mangement of Teaneck, N.J.
In doing so, he added, it may also be possible to get some extras thrown in, such as cleaning sand off roads at the end of winter or planting annuals.
Gil Cross, president of Metro Community Management of Roseville, Minn., said that certain associations were saving money by decreasing the number of dumpster pickups, following the success of recycling efforts. Changing from grass to ground cover under trees, thereby reducing lawn area that needs watering and mowing, offers further savings, he said.
In New York City, the watchwords are "eternal vigilance" in co-ops, which have been shaken by recent allegations of bribery among suppliers and building managers -- and even board members. The best way for co-ops to save money, penny by penny, say the experts, is simply to watch every bill and question every expenditure.
It's hardly glamorous. "But it's amazing how much you can save by doing your homework," said Harry Grier, treasurer of the 92-unit co-op at 800 West End Avenue.
His co-op implemented a 2 percent maintenance decrease in January, having previously changed to electric and water submetering; required every capital expenditure over $10,000 to have shareholder approval and used the proceeds from the sale of three apartments to pay off its underlying mortgage.

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: Change of Location for Water-Tunnel Shaft;
A Bigger Queens Corporate Center Made Possible

 BODY:
It is not clear when the Bulova Corporate Center in Jackson Heights, Queens, will expand. But one big obstacle -- 750 feet deep -- has been removed.
On June 10, Marilyn Gelber, the Commissioner of Environmental Protection, withdrew a plan to build Shaft 17B of the city's third water tunnel on the Bulova property. She said she was responding to concerns that "the shaft could interfere with plans for future development at the site" and "was too close to schools and residences." 
 Instead, Ms. Gelber said, engineers found a more suitable, city-owned site at 46-01 37th Avenue, south of the Sunnyside rail yards in Woodside, Queens.
Borough President Claire Shulman of Queens noted that the new site had "no residential pattern around it" and was next to a rail line that could be used to remove excavated material.
She said she was happy that city officials had changed course. "The Bulova site really has a future for economic development," Mrs. Shulman said. "This would have delayed or killed it."
In 1986, the Blumenfeld Development Group of Syosset, L.I., began converting the Bulova Watch Company's former home into a 483,000-square-foot office building. Tenants now include British Airways, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and the Eastern Paralyzed Veterans Association. Elsewhere on the 23-acre parcel, bordered by the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway and 25th Avenue, Blumenfeld plans a four-story office building, a 10-story hotel, a shopping arcade and a movie theater.
It was on that development site that the city first proposed putting Shaft 17B as part of an 11-mile leg of the new tunnel in Queens and Brooklyn. Later, the shaft site was moved to the parking lot for the Bulova center. Construction was to take six and a half years.
The president of the Bulova Center, Edward Blumenfeld, said that if the shaft had been built, "the quality of life for our residential neighbors, the 2,000 employees who work at our building and the very future of this key economic anchor would have been at risk."

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds;
A Rise in Rates Lifts Money Funds

BYLINE: By Carole Gould 

 BODY:
BOND prices have fallen markedly in 1994, but a silver lining is the increase in money market fund yields. Since Feb. 4, when the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the first time this year, the seven-day average yield on taxable money funds has risen to 3.59 percent, from 2.68 percent, the highest in two years.
While economists disagree on when and how much, many believe the Fed will raise rates again, and that's further good news for money fund investors. 
 "The anticipation of further rate hikes means that yields will continue to increase," said Teresa Redinger, who edits The Money Fund Report, published by IBC/Donoghue in Ashland, Mass.
As rates creep up, investors are starting to slowly move back into money funds. Since February, taxable funds have gained $22.8 billion and tax-free funds have added $5.5 billion. Over all, the cash-flow figures "show significant inflows from retail investors," Ms. Redinger said.
A recent survey found that cash is becoming increasingly attractive. Asked how they would invest their money this month, respondents said they would put an average 32.2 percent of their portfolios into cash, compared with 30.4 percent in November, according to the American Capital Index of Investor Intentions, a national monthly survey of 1,000 people chosen at random.
Given the revived interest in cash, where is the best place to keep it? While bank money market accounts are insured, they generally offer lower yields than money market mutual funds, and the gap is growing.
"The spread in yields between money market mutual funds and bank money market accounts rises as interest rates increase because money funds own investment instruments that tend to rise more quickly in up cycles," said Robert K. Heady, publisher of The Bank Rate Monitor, in North Palm Beach, Fla.
Money market funds yielded 2.75 percent in January, for example, compared with 2.32 percent for bank money market accounts. By June 14, the 0.43 point spread had grown to 1.19 percentage points, with bank accounts yielding 2.40 percent.
But experts advise investors to be wary of money funds that have dabbled in derivative securities in the scramble for competitive advantage amid rock-bottom rates. These investments were intended to raise yields, but did not work as planned when interest rates began rising.
The most recent instance came to light early this month, when the BankAmerica Corporation disclosed that it had injected $17.4 million into its Pacific Horizon Prime Fund in May to preserve the fund's $1 share price.
There have been "a handful" of instances since February in which other fund sponsors have used their own money to make up losses from investments in exotic securities, said Barry Barbash, director of the division of investment management of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Fund companies are quick to preserve their funds' $1 share price because investors use them as if they were insured bank accounts. While S.E.C. regulations on the funds' investments have been aimed at keeping fund prices stable, Wall Street financial engineers have invented new instruments that are not covered by existing rules.
"The rules are so explicit that the funds should not be operated so differently," Mr. Barbash said.
For now, investors who are evaluating money funds should be suspicious of yields that seem too high, experts say. If, after reading the prospectus, you don't understand the fund's investments, ask questions. And if the fund uses derivatives, ask how volatile share prices can be expected to be, Mr. Barbash said.
There are better ways for money fund sponsors to let their investors pocket bigger yields than relying on questionable investing tactics. The best way: lowering expenses.
In fact, price is the chosen battlefield today. In the first quarter of 1994, 60 percent of money market funds waived all or part of their expenses, the highest percentage since IBC/Donoghue began tracking expense waivers in 1988. Moreover, "the trend is continuing as a technique to attract investors even as short-term rates move higher," Ms. Redinger said.
The average charged expenses are 0.59 percent for taxable money funds and 0.58 percent for tax-free funds. Nine funds absorbed all expenses in the first quarter and 578 more, out of 973 total, waived a portion.
Expense waivers are temporary, and investors are well advised to keep close watch. But fund companies have discovered how important they are today. When the top-performing United Services Government Securities money fund reinstituted some fees early this month, it dropped out of the top 10 and promptly restored the waiver.
Investors who can meet high minimum investment amounts can shave expenses even more. The Fidelity Spartan money market, with a $20,000 minimum, yields 3.93 percent, and the Dreyfus Basic money fund, with a $25,000 minimum, yields 3.94 percent. A caveat: Both funds are waiving expenses but could resume them.
A fund with a yield almost as high (3.83 percent) on which fees are not being waived is the Vanguard Admiral U.S. Treasury money fund ($50,000 minimum).

But to understand the continuing impact that Nissan and other Japanese transplants have on American auto making, it helps to start elsewhere, on the northeast side of the plant, where grimy tractor trailers back up to unload transmissions, truck frames, wiper blades and bucket seats. 
 Detroit has made great strides in catching up to its Japanese rivals in production efficiency, partly by studying and learning the lessons of Japanese car-assembly techniques. Today, though, the focus is farther down the manufacturing chain -- the payoff Japanese companies get from close relationships with their suppliers. The companies believe the benefits will include improved quality, faster development of new models and lower costs.
Yet changing the old, arms-length relations between car companies -- Japanese or American -- and American suppliers is proving to be a gradual process at best. In the traditional model, dating back the 1920's, the Big Three held control, designing their own parts and treating their suppliers as second-class industrial citizens competing for their business based on price.
But the car makers want to target their investment on engines, assembly and new-model design, while farming out the design of parts to the some 6,000 suppliers who sell to the American auto industry.
For suppliers, the new arrangement means investing more money and acquiring new skills, especially the engineering expertise needed to design parts. For the car makers, it means giving up some control, sharing their skills and treating suppliers as partners and equals.
"What you've got is a massive cultural change," said David C. Eisenhart, a partner at Coopers & Lybrand, who heads the accounting firm's automotive industry group.
Mr. Eisenhart recently surveyed more than 140 Midwest automotive suppliers who sell both to the Big Three and the Japanese transplants. The American companies in general, he says, remain more focused on squeezing their suppliers for price concessions. The transplants, by contrast, show more patience and work to eliminate the forces that push up costs for their suppliers and prices for them.
"The Japanese have been willing to work with their vendors much more closely," Mr. Eisenhart said.
The Japanese plants in America have plenty of reason these days to work closely with American suppliers. Politically, they are under pressure to increase the domestic content of the cars they assemble here. Several plants claim to have slowly raised the share of components produced in North America to more than 60 percent. Nissan said its purchases of parts and materials in America for the fiscal year ended in March 1993, the most recent calculation, rose 67 percent to $2.35 billion from a year earlier.
The Japanese are being pushed in Washington for further progress. Toyota last week told its American suppliers at a gathering in San Francisco that their quality ratings were below the levels of Japanese suppliers. And the company also said that additional purchases in America will depend on improvements in quality, cost and development-time on the part of the suppliers.
Economically, the strong yen raises the price of cars and parts imported from Japan. So the Japanese companies must make the difficult choice of raising car prices sharply or absorbing big losses. Last month, Nissan reported a pretax loss of nearly $2 billion in the fiscal year ended last March.
THE strong yen places a greater burden on Nissan's Tennessee transplant. "Because of the change in the environment, our vehicles have to carry a lot more of the load," said Jerry L. Benefield, president and chief executive of the Nissan Motor Manufacturing Corporation U.S.A.
Still, despite the political and economic incentives to buy made-in-America parts, Nissan has found that nurturing Japanese-style supplier relationships in America is slow going.
Nissan started hunting for American suppliers even before it opened in Smyrna in 1983. Repeatedly, Mr. Benefield said, Nissan was disappointed because most prospective suppliers lacked the engineering skills the Japanese company had grown to expect. Again, auto industry traditions in America were to blame. For decades, Mr. Benefield explained, "the Big Three handed them a set of designs and said, 'Do it this way. Don't vary.' "
Detroit's centralized design programs slowed the development of new cars and trucks. While Japanese producers, like Nissan, developed new vehicles in four years, the Big Three typically operated on five-year cycles. Not until the late 1980's did the American companies really start to close that gap.
Nissan and the other transplants had prodded their American suppliers to build up the needed research and development skills in-house.
The Big Three, once again, are following Japan's lead. And suppliers point to the Chrysler Corporation as the American company that has made the most progress. For its new compact sedans, the Chrysler Cirrus, due in showrooms this fall, and Dodge Stratus, due early next year, 95 percent of the parts were "presourced." That is, the suppliers were chosen before the parts were even designed, which meant Chrysler virtually eliminated traditional supplier bidding. By contrast, for Chrysler's line of LH cars -- the vehicles for which Chrysler began using a Japanese-style development approach -- only 50 percent of the parts were presourced.
Chrysler is also adopting the traditional Japanese form of price pressure on its suppliers -- lengthy contracts, extending at least the life of the model, that call for step-by-step price reductions. The contracts assume that suppliers, helped by the car makers, will steadily find ways to improve efficiency and reduce waste. Such contracts are one of the tenets of so-called lean manufacturing, a system developed by Taiichi Ohno, Toyota's longtime chief production engineer, during the postwar years.
AT Nissan's plant here, imported parts and components still represent more than 30 percent of the total value of the company's cars and trucks. Yet Nissan has steadily increased its use of American suppliers like the Davis Tool and Engineering Company, a privately owned, $80 million-a-year producer of oil pans and other metal stampings.
The Davis Tool experience with Nissan shows how the transplants work with their suppliers. When Davis Tool bid five years ago to supply parts to the Smyrna plant, Nissan sent engineers from Smyrna and Japan to examine the Davis Tool factory in Detroit, before awarding the company a contract.
Then, as it has done with two dozen suppliers across the United States, Nissan dispatched a pair of engineers from Smyrna for five days to help workers at Davis Tool's factory rethink their jobs.
THE results astounded the managers at Davis Tool. At the end of five days, two workers were churning out 800 oil pans each shift, where four workers used to make 500 each shift. At Nissan's urging, Davis Tool assured its workers that they would not lose their jobs because of efficiency gains. Any displaced workers would be moved elsewhere in the Detroit plant.
Some of the changes seemed obvious, like raising parts bins to hip level so that workers were not forever bending all the way over and straining their backs. The team broke down each workers job, timing each activity to identify any waste. The company then was able to combine tasks, saving time and space. The company had never before been prodded into such thorough scrutiny of its practices, explained Richard L. Davis 2d, president of Davis Industries, the parent for Davis Tool. The Japanese, he said, are "bringing these skills to their new supply base." He added, "Nissan encouraged us to apply the techniques to our other customers."
To help suppliers, Nissan has also created a training program in Smyrna. Managers from supplier companies are brought in for courses that last about 16 days and range from problem solving to W. Edwards Deming techniques for improving quality. And Nissan has divided its suppliers into regional groups. Suppliers from each region tour each other's factories to examine efficiency-enhancing tactics on everything from layout to lighting.
Yet working with companies that ship their parts and components directly to the Nissan plant is really the last leg of the supply chain. For every so-called first-tier supplier shipping straight to the auto makers, there are several second- and third-tier suppliers whose quality is also crucial to the vehicle, and whose efficiency is critical to the auto makers' financial performance.
Here again, the Japanese companies appear to have an edge over the Big Three, partly because the transplants brought some of their Japanese suppliers with them.
Grand Rapids Spring and Wire Products Inc. is one of the second-tier American suppliers that has managed to adapt to the Japanese methods. The $13 million-a-year, Michigan company sells springs and clips to the Calsonic Corporation, an American subsidiary of one of Nissan's stable of Japanese suppliers. The Calsonic plant, near Smyrna, makes air-conditioners, heaters and exhaust systems used in Nissan cars and trucks.
While tiny, Grand Rapids Spring and Wire considered itself a high-quality producer. So it was confident when it approached Calsonic in 1987, recalled Larry Beurkens, the company's general manager. Its performance ratings from its American customers were consistently high. So when Calsonic gave Grand Rapids a marginal score, "we were in a state of shock," he said.
Still, Calsonic offered the company a contract in 1988. But Grand Rapids Spring and Wire, despite its big investment in production for Calsonic, kept falling short of the company's quality and other standards. Finally, by 1990, Mr. Beurkens was frustrated with trying to satisfy Calsonic, which only accounted for a tiny proportion of its business. "I just said, 'Let's get rid of them -- it's not worth it,' " he recalled.
But then, he said, Calsonic did something unusual. The day after Mr. Beurkens's company called and said it wanted out, Calsonic officials were at his Grand Rapids plant, coaching Mr. Beurkens and others, and the company's scores began to rise. Since then, Grand Rapids's business with transplants has risen to 15 percent of its annual revenue.
Calsonic's approach, Mr. Beurkens said, was a sharp break from his experience with American suppliers to the Big Three. "If I've got a problem," he said, "They say, 'Yeah? What are you going to do about it?' "
And when it came to pricing, Mr. Beurkens added, his company has a real partnership with Calsonic, far more so than with domestic companies. "In the other world, it's domination," he said. " 'If you don't like what I say, there are a hundred suppliers just like you.' The hammer, we call it."

At Simon & Schuster, a Pawn in the Corporate Game
Publishing sometimes seems a world apart, exempt from big-money corporate chess games. But the outside world crashed in on this literary island last week when Viacom, which recently acquired Simon & Schuster as part of its Paramount package, swooped into the publishing house and sacked the man who'd built it into a powerhouse in recent decades, Richard E. Snyder. The publishing world's reaction: shock, mystification -- and jitters about the fate of various authors. Viacom gave a well-worn explanation: a difference in styles. But it soon spied a gathering storm, and moved quickly to calm it, going out of its way to state its "commitment to literature and the printed word." Of course, not everyone at Simon & Schuster mourned, as some were glad to bid farewell to what they called Mr. Snyder's explosive temper. They expected his successor, Jonathan Newcomb, to set a softer tone. 

Exxon's Bill Isn't Paid Yet
Exxon has already spent $3.4 billion in response to the Valdez oil spill more than five years ago, mostly in its huge cleanup effort -- a huge amount, yes, but finite. Exxon, whose revenues last year were close to $111 billion, could handle it. But now an even bigger, open-ended bill could be coming due. Last week a Federal jury ruled that Exxon had been reckless in putting the time bomb of a tanker full of oil in the hands of a man known for alcohol abuse. Now the jury must decide on damages, and the plaintiffs are asking for more than $15 billion, which even for Exxon starts to sound like real money. Exxon's stock, which stood at $42 soon after the spill, has since risen strongly, but this ruling gave it a jolt of reality, knocking it down nearly $5, or 8 percent, in three days before it steadied itself at $58.75 by week's end.
 
A Key Recruit for New World
A few weeks ago, New World Communications shook up the television industry by switching 12 of its stations to Fox (8 were CBS affiliates). And in case that didn't put New World on the map, this certainly will: last week it named Brandon Tartikoff to head its production. It was Mr. Tartikoff who turned NBC into such a power in the mid-80's, so his presence could quickly make New World a strong source of programming. And that means the Fox network would have to be taken a lot more seriously, too.
 
Next Flavor: You and Jerry's?
Look at it this way: What if Ben & Jerry's, in need of a chief executive, had soberly chosen from a bunch of plain-vanilla dynamos? It could be enough to send you back to Breyer's. But Ben & Jerry's, the oddest corporate flavor around, didn't disappoint. When Ben Cohen said last week that he was looking for a successor as chief (though he'll stay on as chairman), he did it with style: he invited customers to write essays telling why they should get the job. But even as he spoke, one drop of the Ben & Jerry's myth melted away: the company scrapped its policy of limiting a top executive's pay to seven times the salary of the lowest-paid worker.
 
Another Painkiller? Oh, My Head!
Let's face it: the rest of this stuff matters little if you have a headache. And you probably do, given the frantic way most people live. Pain relief is big business in America -- as in $2.5 billion a year, just for nonprescription drugs -- so it's big news when a new type of analgesic appears. No, make that: Procter & Gamble and Syntex want it to be big news. Last week they introduced Aleve (pronounced a-LEAVE, as in "alleviate"; get it?), an over-the-counter version of Anaprox, and they plan to spend fully $100 million to sell it in its first year. But how much can drugstore shelves take? And do those who came of age on aspirin, and who've finally learned to spell acetaminophen and ibuprofen, have the strength to add "naproxen sodium" to their vocabulary? It could give you a headache.
 
A Data Highway Crossover
Normally the mileposts in the information revolution are seen in technologies; sometimes they're visible merely in the jobs people take. Last week there was a vivid example of the latter. Robert Kavner, a top AT&T executive who at 50 was a possible contender to run the company one day, made what just a few years ago would have seemed a bizarre career leap: he joined the Creative Artists Agency, the mighty Hollywood talent shop run by Michael Ovitz. The message? Simple: Hollywood intends to play a big role on the data highway; entertainment, information and communications are becoming one. Anyway, heading a great company is not "the ultimate in life," Mr. Kavner said. "I wanted to put myself on the fun meter."
 
Score One for AT&T
AT&T, meanwhile, scored a victory in the Supreme Court last week. The F.C.C. had tried to liven up long-distance competition by letting AT&T's rivals, but not AT&T itself, bypass an advance listing of rates and services. But the Court, which has been hostile to various deregulatory moves, ruled that it lacked the authority to do so. A big loser was MCI, which had used the F.C.C. policy to cut custom-made deals with big companies.
 
THE ECONOMY
 
Robert Brennan's Day in Court
Robert Brennan is back. You remember: First Jersey Securities; a fit-looking Mr. Brennan, with helicopter as high-status backdrop, urging you to "come grow with us"; charges of defrauding penny-stock customers. Mr. Brennan quit as First Jersey chairman in 1986 and sold its retail branches, and in 1987 the firm paid $10 million to settle a class action suit. But not until last week did Mr. Brennan go to trial, with the S.E.C. now seeking repayment of what it says are $27 million in illegal profits (with interest: $78 million). Does Mr. Brennan, a boy wonder now 50, seem repentant? Hardly. He coolly testified that First Jersey had maintained "the highest standards." And the S.E.C. assertions? "Hogwash."
 
When in Doubt, Reform Welfare
Health care is what it's all about this year, but just to spice things up, President Clinton threw his "end welfare as we know it" plan into the hopper last week too. Most details of the $9.3 billion plan are old news -- expanded training; two years to join a work program or you're out; a get-tough approach to child support -- but Mr. Clinton apparently decided to put it forward now so he could have something tough to point to if political realities demanded. But Mr. Clinton may yet achieve the goal he just outlined -- make welfare "a stepping stone, not a way of life."
 
Mr. D'Amato's Magic Touch
Speaking of one-day trading profits -- which a lot of Republicans have been doing lately -- it now appears that Al D'Amato, one of the most vocal Hillary-bashers, had a nice piece of good fortune himself last year. Mr. D'Amato's 1993 financial disclosure form, made public last week, shows that last June the Senator invested $18,000 in an initial stock offering of a California company called Computer Marketplace and sold the shares that same day for more than $55,000. Since then, the shares have dropped sharply. The underwriter (which awarded Mr. D'Amato the right to buy at the offering price): Stratton Oakmont, which Federal regulators say is a boiler-room outfit that defrauds investors. The firm's founder has contributed to Mr. D'Amato's campaign and to the Republican Party.
 
All for One in Latin America
As the world teams up into trading blocs, Latin America has no intention of being left out. Yes, there's a scattering of smaller groups -- one includes Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay; another, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela -- but last week Latin nations moved to join forces. The region's 19 largest nations agreed to form a single free-trade zone. "Our union is fundamental," said President Eduardo Frei of Chile. And this is good news for United States exporters, for tariffs should plummet.
 
Oil Prices Head Up Again
Don't look now, but oil prices have been rising steadily for several months now, and last week jumped to their highest point in a year. The culprit, as usual, was a mix of scattered fears feeding on one another: tensions over North Korea, new signs that Iraq's oil will not be flowing into the world pool any time soon, and a show of OPEC resolve to keep a lid on output. But what it added up to was a barrel of oil costing more than $20, last topped in June 1993. That's the kind of thing that makes people start talking about inflation.

Surprise: Bigger Isn't Always Better

BYLINE: By Barbara Presley Noble 

 BODY:
MANY companies continue to make health insurance available to their employees, but coverage is declining, a Labor Department study has found. The overall percentage of workers receiving coverage through their employers dropped to 61 percent last year from 65 percent in 1988. The drop in coverage occurred mostly in the private sector, where it went to 58 percent from 62 percent over the last five years. Public sector coverage dropped by only 1 percentage point. About 37 million workers receive no insurance through their employers and 16 million of them have no coverage at all.
"This report makes clear that employer-provided health insurance is still the bedrock of America's health care system, but it's ailing," Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich said when he announced the findings late last month. Not surprisingly, Mr. Reich said the research underscores the "urgent need" for health care reform. 
 The explanation for the drop in coverage -- cost -- isn't surprising either. Employers are dropping sponsorship of plans and employees are more likely to decline coverage.
What is most surprising, however, is that the decline appeared at companies of all sizes, not just at the small businesses supposedly at risk of oblivion if, under a new health insurance order, they were required to provide coverage. From 1979 to 1993, coverage in businesses with fewer than 25 employees dropped 2 percentage points, to 31 percent.
IN companies with more than 100 workers, the comparable decline was 10 percentage points: to 73 percent from 83 percent. Theoretically, the smaller base of smaller companies offering coverage could account for the disparity: There's more room to cut in the big-company category. But apparently it doesn't. "The lower base accounts for some of it, but it's a pretty significant change," said Richard Hinz, director of research and economic analysis at the Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration, the Labor Department agency that sponsored the research. "One of the myths is that erosion of coverage is erosion of small-business coverage. In fact, it's across the board."
Large companies are still more likely to provide health coverage in retirement. Last year just over half of the companies with more than 1,000 workers made coverage available to retirees, a jump from about a third for businesses of the next-largest size. The startling finding was the proportion of people older than 45 -- 25 percent to 40 percent, depending on company size -- who didn't know if they would be covered, despite the fact that by that age most people have had inklings of mortality. "That's a remarkable finding," Mr. Hinz said. "The 'don't knows' don't seem to be associated with any particular characteristic." Of course, perhaps it is better to be oblivious since retiree insurance at many companies may soon go the way of Robespierre's head.
The report, which is based on questions asked during the Census Department's April 1993 Current Population Survey, provides more detailed information than usual on pensions and health benefits in companies of all sizes around the country.
 
Women at Risk
 A study published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute last week suggested that women electrical workers may be at a higher risk for developing breast cancer than women in other jobs. Previous research has indicated a possible connection between exposure to electromagnetic fields and increased risk for certain types of cancers.
Researchers from the School of Public Health at the University of North Carolina compared the death certificates of women exposed to extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields -- the kind produced by high-voltage power lines, for example -- and women in nonelectrical jobs. Of 267 cases of women in traditional electrical occupations, 68 had died of breast cancer -- a rate 38 percent higher than expected, the study said.
The higher mortality rates occurred among women who had worked as electrical engineers, telephone installers, repairers and line workers. The researchers found no "excess of breast cancer" among telephone operators, data entry clerks or computer operators and programmers, though they, too, often have more exposure to electricity than other workers.
 
 
 
A CREATIVE OUTLOOK ON WELFARE
IS welfare a dependency that promotes what sociologists used to call "serial monogamy" even while it saps the individual's will to work? Or is it a coping strategy poor people use intermittently and rather creatively to stave off disaster?
Continuing studies from the Institute on Women's Policy Research in Washington suggest the latter. Contradicting the image of the welfare population as inert and irresponsible, the institute found that only one-third of a sample of single mothers on Aid to Families With Dependent Children from 1984 through 1990 relied exclusively on their grants and benefits to get by. Forty percent "package" wages from work with grants and benefits to achieve a livable income, either moving back and forth over time between work and welfare or simultaneously combining income from several sources.
The information that nearly half the single-mother welfare population is working at least part time does not seem to have contaminated the debate on reform, which is no longer about labor force participation but about preventing teen-age pregnancy. The institute's research indicates that a "two years and you're out" plan like the one proposed last week by President Clinton would leave most women on welfare at the mercy of the low-wage labor market. "Dependency," in other words, can be a rational choice.

HEADLINE: POLL FINDS A LACK OF FAITH IN POLICE

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

 BODY:
New Yorkers express anxiety about the Police Department's ability to protect them, and many say there is widespread corruption in the force, according to a New York Times/WCBS-TV News Poll.
The survey and follow-up interviews suggest a serious lack of confidence in the department because of a fear of crime and concern over revelations of corruption in several precincts. 
 Despite police reports of a slight though steady decrease in crime over the last four years, the poll found a general perception that crime has increased or remained at the same levels as last year. More than a third of those polled said that because of their fear of crime they had moved to new neighborhoods or were planning to. Many, especially in Hispanic and black neighborhoods, say they have taken measures like riding the subway less, staying home at night or avoiding places that they used to go to.
The telephone poll of 1,189 adult residents conducted from June 12 to June 15 is just a snapshot, and the extent to which opinions might have changed recently is uncertain, because many questions were asked for the first time. But the findings suggest that the image of the department is badly bruised just when it is introducing new crime-fighting strategies that rely on community cooperation, like having beat officers seek intelligence on drug dealers and gun traffickers from residents.
The worries about crime and police performance span racial, economic and ethnic lines. But skepticism about the Police Department is expressed most strongly by minority-group residents. A majority of black and Hispanic New Yorkers and a sizable minority of whites say the police are generally tougher on minority members.
The poll and subsequent interviews with participants etch a picture of New Yorkers who live in fear, especially fear of teen-agers. Thirty-six percent of those polled said they had seen people selling drugs near their homes in recent months, and 23 percent said they or members of their immediate families had been victims of crime in the last year. Those levels are similar to numbers from other polls in the last four years.
"In Brooklyn, at least, the police are overwhelmed by the amount of crime and the lack of money, equipment and facilities to deal with it," said Loren K. Popkoff, 31, a high school teacher who lives in Midwood and was mugged for the second time in five years, in May 1993. Ms. Popkoff and her husband bought a guard dog after vandals began taping large fireworks to windows in the neighborhood. "I think things are getting worse," she said.
Of all the problems facing the city, 41 percent said, crime was the one that they wanted Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to concentrate on. Education came in second, with 10 percent. Fifty-seven percent said they approved of how Mr. Giuliani was handling the crime problem. The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
Fifty-eight percent of those polled said the crimes most likely to involve them were assault, mugging or robbery. For more violent crimes, 9 percent fear being shot and 3 percent fear being murdered. But twice as many blacks as whites and five times as many Hispanic residents as whites said the crime they thought that they would be a victim of was a shooting.
Although comparable percentages in each racial category reported having been crime victims, black and Hispanic New Yorkers have generally been more prone than whites to change behavior to counter crime.
 
A Widespread Malaise
 The broad level of anxiety, follow-up interviews found, sometimes appeared stirred more by a lack of confidence in the Police Department and by vandalism than any concrete evidence that violence is increasing in their neighborhoods.
"I think crime is getting worse all over -- not just here in Brighton Beach -- from reading the newspapers and talking to people," said Seymour Friedman, 78, a retired tool maker, despite never having been a victim and despite police findings that reported crimes in most felony categories in his Brooklyn neighborhood had declined significantly in recent years.
"You get more of a feeling that something bad can happen to you than you used to," said Barry Welch, 52, a cabinetmaker who lives on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. He attributed that sense to increased noise made at night by reveling teen-agers and the "tremendous increase in car vandalism."
"Windows are smashed, which I didn't see when I first came here in 1988," Mr. Welch said.
Ronald Henderson, 50, a building superintendent in Morris Park, the Bronx, said he became convinced that patrols in his neighborhood were insufficient when he found the nuts screwed off the wheels of his Honda Accord two months ago. "This was done in daylight hours," he recounted. "It was, like, I felt there was nobody to protect my belongings. You are always in danger."
By every measure, a substantial percentage of New Yorkers polled are unhappy with the performance of the Police Department, even though 40 percent said they thought that more officers were patrolling their neighborhoods than a year ago. A full 50 percent said they did not feel adequately protected by the police, compared with 42 percent who said they were adequately protected.
Fifty-one percent said the department was doing a fair or poor job compared with 48 percent who said the police were doing a good or excellent job. Whites had the most positive view of the police, with 63 percent saying the department was doing good or excellent work. Fewer than a third of blacks, on the other hand, viewed the force as performing well, with 67 percent saying it was doing a fair or poor job.
Some experts said the public's negative perceptions were a consequence of the widely reported corruption case in the 30th Precinct, where more than 20 officers have been arrested or are being investigated for drug trafficking or other felonies.
Police Commissioner William J. Bratton predicted that New Yorkers would feel better about crime and the police force after several of new anticrime strategies took hold. Of the strong concerns about police corruption, he said: "These are perceptions being shaped by the reporting, the investigations and the attention the department has been paying to it. We have not been running away from this issue."
Milton Mollen, the former Deputy Mayor who is leading a panel on police corruption, said: "Our investigation indicates to us that the facts and reality are somewhat different than the perception that has followed from the revelations. We are convinced that most police officers are honest, and not corrupt."
Most people say the officer on the beat is very or somewhat honest, but 43 percent said corruption was widespread through the department. Broken down by race, 58 percent of blacks said corruption was ingrained, compared with 51 percent of Hispanic residents and 32 percent of whites.
Aaron Purdue, 38, an unemployed office worker who lives a few blocks from the 30th Precinct station house, in Harlem, said that he "was not surprised at all" about reports that many officers in the precinct were implicated in drug dealing or other crimes. "I've heard stories of cops' taking money from people," Mr. Purdue said. "The combination of inadequate policing and corruption go hand in hand."
 
'You Get a Different Look'
 Like a large majority of black and Hispanic New Yorkers polled, Mr. Purdue, who is black, complained that the police treated minority members in tougher ways than they treated whites. "Even just coming on the subway, you get a different look," he said.
Samuel Correa, 19, of the Bushwick, Brooklyn, and a son of Puerto Rican and Dominican parents, said: "It depends on the cop. It depends on his race. The cop is going to favor his race."
Marianne Alarcon, 54, an immigrant from Colombia and a secretary who lives in Corona, Queens, said she was unhappy with the police when she called her precinct last week to complain that teen-agers were awakening her at 2 A.M. by smashing glass in the street. The line was continually busy and she could not get through she said, "leaving me feeling weak in these conditions."
"I don't feel safe," she added.
Mrs. Alarcon was recently forced to change where she shops for food because drug dealers were hanging out in front of the old store. "I can't say how much police corruption there is, but I saw with my own eyes the police were on the corner," she said. "What is that? Are they not paying attention?"
White and more affluent residents viewed the police more favorably. "I think the police are pretty good," said Helen Arminas, 62, a retired executive of a coffee brokerage who lives in Fort Wadsworth, Staten Island. Although she lives no more than a five-minute drive from Park Hill, where Ernest Sayon died in police custody in a case being investigated, Mrs. Arminas said, "That's very rare." Expressing confidence that the department would clean up any corruption problems, she said, "If policemen are not doing their job I'm sure they are going to pay for it."
 
How the Survey Was Conducted
 The latest New York Times/WCBS-TV News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted June 12 to 15 in all parts of New York City with 1,189 adults. Interviews were conducted in English or Spanish.
The telephone exchanges called were selected by a computer from a complete list of city exchanges. The exchanges were chosen to ensure that each area in the city was represented in proportion to its population. For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits, thus including both listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was designated at random to respond to the survey.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence, and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to borough, race, sex, age and education.
In theory in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples would differ by no more than three percenatge points in either direction from a poll of all adult New Yorkers.
For smaller subgroups, the potential sampling error is larger. For example, it is 6 percentage points for all blacks and 6 percentage points for all Hispanics.
Besides sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any opinion survey may introduce other errors. Differences in the wording and order of questions, for instance, can cause results to vary somewhat.

HEADLINE: Two Koreas Plan Summit Talks on Nuclear Issue

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, June 18

 BODY:
For the first time since the Korean peninsula was divided five decades ago, the Presidents of North and South Korea agreed today to hold a summit meeting, which is likely to focus on defusing tensions over the North's suspected effort to build a nuclear weapon.
The agreement was brokered by former President Jimmy Carter, who delivered the offer from North Korea's 82-year-old leader, Kim Il Sung, after returning to Seoul this morning from a three-day visit to Pyongyang. 
 South Korea's President, Kim Young Sam, immediately met Mr. Carter at Blue House, the presidential mansion in the mountains ringing Seoul, and told him that "the sooner the better," aides said.
But South Korean officials acknowledged that there was reason to question whether a summit meeting between the two countries, still technically at war, would ever take place. They noted that many agreements between North and South have been thrown onto the scrap heap.
The state-run Korean Broadcasting System suggested in a television analysis tonight that "this could be another attempt by the North to buy time and escape from a tense situation."
Mr. Carter also used his visit to deliver a stinging critique of the Clinton Administration's strategy of seeking United Nations sanctions against the North as part of an effort to force Mr. Kim to give up his nuclear weapons program.
At a news conference outside the American Ambassador's house here, Mr. Carter said he believed that economic sanctions were doomed to failure and would do nothing but further poison relations between the North and the rest of the world.
"The declaration of sanctions by the U.N. would be regarded as an insult by them, branding it as an outlaw country," he said. It would also constitute "a personal insult to their so-called Great Leader," Kim Il Sung, Mr. Carter said, "by branding him as a liar and a criminal.
"This is something in my opinion which would be impossible for them to accept," he added.
He did not mention the North's frequent threats to regard any sanctions as an act of war.
Mr. Carter's criticism and the prospect of a Korean summit meeting may take much of the steam out of the Administration's push for sanctions, which may be exactly what the North Korean leader wanted.
Seoul sought a North-South summit meeting as early as 1981, when South Korea was ruled by the military strongman Chun Doo Hwan. When Kim Young Sam took office last year as the South's first civilian President in decades, he repeated the offer.
But posturing and the imposition of conditions on both sides have always scuttled hopes of a meeting before one was ever scheduled.
Some experts on North Korea here believe that now the situation may be different because both men stand to gain politically from a meeting.
Mr. Carter traveled to North Korea as a private citizen, not as an envoy of Mr. Clinton, a point he made repeatedly today. But the former President's frequent contacts with the White House -- and his description of a still-vague offer from the North to freeze its nuclear program temporarily if high-level talks began with the United States -- have clearly changed the dynamics of the standoff.
 
Differences With Clinton
 On the one hand, it has given the Administration another opening to try to make diplomacy work, just as the White House is pressing for sanctions and weighing reinforcement of the 37,000 American troops here. But Mr. Carter's sharp differences with the White House over sanctions and his seeming embrace of Mr. Kim also threaten to unravel the Administration's effort to keep up the pressure by building a consensus for economic sanctions in the United Nations Security Council.
The sanctions issue became a point of dispute on Friday at the White House after Mr. Carter, in comments broadcast by CNN, appeared to tell his North Korean hosts that the Administration had agreed to suspend its drive to punish the North. Mr. Clinton and his aides quickly said they had done nothing of the sort.
Mr. Carter insisted today that his words had been misinterpreted. The sanctions, he said, would be held in abeyance only if Mr. Kim agreed to open the nuclear program to full inspection.
 
'Reverence' to Leader
 But he made clear that he viewed the sanctions drive as a misguided effort that would only harden the North Koreans' will to confront the United States. He said this view was confirmed "after observing their psyche and their societal structure and the reverence with which they look upon their leader."
Mr. Carter said that Mr. Kim had assured him that North Korea was not building nuclear weapons.
Mr. Carter heaped praise on Kim Il Sung, the aging warrior who started the Korean War 44 years ago. "I found him to be vigorous, intelligent, surprisingly well informed about the technical issues and in charge of the decisions about this country," he said.
There are frequent rumors that Mr. Kim's health is declining. But in television coverage of Mr. Carter's visit, the North Korean leader appeared alert and active.
One of the surprises of the trip is that Mr. Carter met Mr. Kim's wife, who is rarely seen in public. South Korean press reports indicate that Mr. Carter was also offered an opportunity to meet Kim Jong Il, the 52-year-old son and heir apparent of Kim Il Sung, but turned it down.
The younger Mr. Kim almost never sees foreign visitors, and experts on North Korea have often speculated that he lacks an ability to lead and to command respect from the military.
 
No Nuclear Freeze
 Ever since Mr. Carter crossed into North Korean territory on Wednesday, he has prompted a trans-Pacific debate over whether he was sending the North the right signals, and whether Mr. Kim's offers to him stand up to scrutiny.
The most important was an offer by Mr. Kim to freeze his nuclear program as long as high-level talks with the Administration are initiated and continue. Mr. Carter cautioned, however, that Mr. Kim "did not agree to a permanent freeze."
Such a freeze, he quoted the North Korean leader as saying, would have to be negotiated in another round of high-level talks. It would also be linked to fulfillment of Mr. Kim's oft-stated goal to replace North Korea's old graphite-moderated reactors with newer light-water reactors. The old reactors have a greater chance of producing bomb-grade plutonium that could be used in nuclear arms.
Mr. Kim's other condition, he said, was a guarantee from the United States that North Korea will never be the target of a nuclear attack.
 
Repackaging Old Offers?
 Mr. Carter seemed to acknowledge that his trip had touched off arguments over whether Mr. Kim was offering new openings, or simply rephrasing and recombining old offers.
The Administration has said that before it goes ahead with talks, the North must commit itself to a three-part "verifiable freeze" on its nuclear activities.
The first condition is that international inspectors, now at the North's main nuclear reactor in Yongbyon, are permitted to stay. Mr. Carter said Mr. Kim gave him that assurance.
The second condition is that none of the fuel rods removed from the reactor last month are reprocessed into weapons-grade material. That is a more difficult choice for the North Koreans: unless they reprocess those rods relatively soon, they will develop impurities, harming their best source of bomb material in years.
The third condition, officials say, is that the reactor must not be filled with new fuel rods that could be used to make more weapons fuel. The North claims that the reactor is for research into power production.
American officials here say the North's decision whether to abide by a freeze will probably determine whether the Administration goes ahead with talks with the North.

U.S. Official to Meet Carter
 WASHINGTON, June 18 (Special to The New York Times) -- White House officials said today that the national security adviser, Anthony Lake, would meet with Mr. Carter on Sunday to discuss his trip.
The White House issued a statement that mentioned neither the proposed meeting of Korean Presidents nor Mr. Carter's criticism of sanctions proposals. It said the Administration would seek to confirm the "preliminary reports" of North Korean offers with Mr. Carter and through diplomatic channels.
The statement said that "U.S. policy remains unchanged" and that the Administration is "continuing to consult on a sanctions resolution at the U.N. Security Council."

HEADLINE: Opponents of Disney Park Find Allies in Congress

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 17

 BODY:
A festering dispute between advocates and foes of a theme park that the Walt Disney Company is planning to build near important Civil War battlegrounds has spilled out of Virginia and into Congress, turning what began as a local spat into a national debate.
Largely at the urging of environmentalists and historians who want to protect the region from urban sprawl, a bipartisan group of 16 House members this week introduced a resolution opposing the park, Disney's America, which would be built in Prince William County about 35 miles west of Washington. In addition, a Senate subcommittee has been persuaded to hold a hearing, which is set for Tuesday. 
 It remains unclear just how disruptive this additional layer of opposition will be to the $650 million project, scheduled for completion in 1998. While the House opponents called on Disney to build elsewhere and urged Federal agencies to insure that development complied with laws governing air quality, transportation and historic preservation, their step was only a call to arms, not a threat of legislative action.
Disney officials say they are not worried.
"I don't see anything anywhere that would impede forward progress," Michael D. Eisner, Disney's chairman, said in an interview this week. "I would have thought that if we could do something in a celebratory way, people would be enthusiastic."
 
Backers See a Boon
 In fact, many Virginians are enthusiastic, among them Gov. George Allen, Senator John W. Warner and seven of the eight members of the Prince William Board of Supervisors. Like them, thousands of county residents see the 3,006-acre theme park as a boon to development, employment and the local tax base. Mr. Allen was the driving force behind a $163 million bond issue for the Disney project; most of the proceeds will pay for improving roads in the area.
Robert Singletary, chairman and president of the Welcome Disney Committee, a coalition of 11 organizations, hailed the benefits projected by Disney: 19,000 permanent jobs, 2,800 construction jobs, $48 million a year in new state taxes and up to $12 million for Prince William County.
"People are interested in seeing Prince William grow economically and grow soundly," Mr. Singletary said. Those who raise environmental and historical concerns, he said, are speaking nonsense.
 
'Issues Are Now Elevated'
 But his is not a universal view in Congress, and the project's opponents predict that the interest of Federal lawmakers will dramatically widen the focus of debate and perhaps force Disney to choose an alternative site.
"The issues are now elevated and really joined for the first time," said Neil Proto, a lawyer representing a group of authors and historians fighting the project. "Once they're elevated, I think they will be taken very seriously. To now, there has been no detached, objective analysis of the project. The facts have only come from Virginia and Disney. The process now will yield disclosure of the real facts, hopefully, early enough to affect all major decisions made about this."
With so many of Virginia's political leaders supporting the Disney plan, which envisions hotels, shops, two golf courses and 2,281 residential units, opponents see Federal involvement as their best and perhaps only chance to force Disney to build elsewhere.
They argue that the theme park and other Disney plans would spur so much commercial and residential development that traffic would choke roads, spoil the air quality and overwhelm existing neighborhoods.
And they assert that it would endanger what many historians consider some of the most hallowed grounds of American history. One group has identified 13 historic towns, 16 Civil War battlefields, including Manassas, and 17 historic districts within an hour's drive of Haymarket, the town nearest the site of the proposed park.
 
'More Than a Local Issue'
 In announcing the House resolution, Representative Michael A. Andrews, a Texas Democrat who led a fight six years ago against development of a shopping center near the Manassas National Battlefield Park, called the Disney project "far more than a local issue" and said the impact on Manassas and the Shenandoah National Park "would be devastating."
In a letter to Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, Mr. Andrews implored that Disney be held to regulatory environmental standards, and he urged that Interior do what it can to delay the project.
But given the deliberate pace of Washington and the complexity of the debate, opponents say, they are not sure that the Government can act swiftly or forcefully enough to force Disney to build elsewhere.
For the project to be affected, they say, lawmakers would have to insist that Disney's plans strictly meet the standards of Federal statutes like the Clean Air Act of 1991 and the Inter-Modal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, which determines whether a particular transportation system is adequate for the region it serves.
They also say that Interior could determine that the project would have negative effects on national parklands. Mr. Andrews's letter to Mr. Babbitt raises questions about plans to widen two roads that run through the Manassas battlefield park.
Historians say these are the same roads used by troops during the Civil War, and the fields they traverse are virtually unchanged from a century ago. Widening the roads would mean using land that is part of the battlegrounds, and that could give Interior the right to intercede.
"The department has the authority to declare an impact on national parklands, and that would make development very difficult or impossible," said Representative Robert G. Torricelli, a New Jersey Democrat who was a co-sponsor of the resolution.
The project's foes say that the population explosion in Prince William County in the last decade has already had adverse effects on air quality and transportation. Since 1980, the population has grown to 238,000 from 100,000.
 
The Problem of Traffic
 Sandy Hillyer, director of the National Growth Management Leadership Project, said that even with the planned road improvements and Disney's own projection that traffic volume in the area would no more than double once the park opened, compliance with Federal regulations would be impossible.
Residents already complain that Interstate 66 west of Washington is clogged beyond reason. Many residents of Prince William County who work in Washington say the one-way trip in rush-hour traffic can take an hour or longer.
"We already have a smog problem in the D.C. metropolitan area," Mr. Hillyer said. "At the minimum, we have to reduce smog-creating emissions 24 percent by 1999. That is a staggering burden when you have trends for greater automobile use."
It is also, he added, a shared burden: if one area in the region is generating higher fuel emissions, others have to cut back to comply with regulations. Failure to meet the standards could lead to a cutoff of funds from the Federal Highway Administration and higher parking taxes or higher gasoline taxes.
State and county officials, as well as Disney executives, have repeatedly argued that the project would enhance the area and that the groups opposed to Disney's America have no cause for alarm.
Mr. Eisner, nonetheless, praised their tactics. "Their strategy to try to delay us is a smart one," he said. "To delay costs money. Many companies would throw in the towel."
But whatever the opponents do, he quickly added, "will certainly not stop us."

HEADLINE: The Two Koreas: 5 Decades of Division

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SEOUL, June 18

 BODY:
The division of the Korean peninsula, which may be breached slightly if the Presidents of North and South Korea meet for the first time, was invented by the Americans with Soviet help.
The divide was established on Sept. 3, 1945, shortly after the Japanese, who ruled Korea as a colony for 35 years, surrendered, ending World War II. The Americans would run the South, it was decided, and the Russians the North. 
 But it was not until 1948 that the North Korean Communists founded the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and installed Kim Il Sung as its leader. Today he is the world's longest-surviving ruler. For its part, the United States installed a seemingly pliable President, Syngman Rhee.
Two years later the Korean War began, with Communist forces pouring across the 38th parallel. The war lasted for three years, ending with an armistice but no official end to hostilities. Since then both sides have steadily increased their military preparedness, the North gathering together an army of 1.1 million, the South upgrading equipment and training.
Mr. Kim developed a personality cult, which boomed when the country came into periodic conflict with the West during the cold war.
In 1972 the North and South announced an agreement to end hostility and work toward "peaceful unification of the nation." That led to the so-called Red Cross talks between the two countries, but the negotiations collapsed and South Korea soon entered a period of martial law, coups and assassinations of its leaders.
In the 1970's and 80's, a series of provocations and terrorist acts seemed aimed at sabotaging the Seoul Government and its American protector. Two American Army officers were hacked to death by North Korean guards at the border village of Panmunjom in 1976. Several years later, North Korean agents are believed to have planted a bomb that killed many members of the South Korean Cabinet during a trip to Rangoon, Burma, now called Yangon, Myanmar. In 1987 a South Korean aircraft disappeared over Burma, and investigators said it had been destroyed by a bomb. Later, a woman who was involved in the bombing said she had acted under instructions from Kim Jong Il, the son of Kim Il Sung.
It was not until the end of the cold war that on-again, off-again peace talks began to show some results. In 1991 an accord was reached that called for a Korean peninsula free of nuclear weapons and for the opening of roads, rail links and regular family exchanges between North and South. Almost none of it has been put into effect. By last year, the question of the North's nuclear weapons project had taken center stage. In May, after 18 months of talks, Mr. Clinton decided to seek sanctions.
The two Koreas have grown apart economically at an ever-faster pace. The South, once the weaker of the two, now has a gross domestic product that is 15 times greater than the North's; at current rates, it grows a new North Korea every year. The South's greatest fear is of a flood of refugees when the North finally collapses. So the watchword now is a "soft landing" for the North that puts off the day when South Korea is sent the bill.

HEADLINE: Canada Rebuffs Veterans of U.S. Forces in Vietnam

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TORONTO, June 16

 BODY:
During the Vietnam War, as thousands of young Americans sought refuge in Canada to avoid the conflict, thousands of young Canadians were recruited by the United States to fight in that same war.
Some 20,000 American draft dodgers and 12,000 deserters are estimated to have fled to Canada, while 40,000 Canadians, the majority of them volunteers, served in the American armed forces, and at least 12,000 fought in Southeast Asia. 
 Most went for adventure. Many from Quebec and French-speaking parts of New Brunswick say they signed up chiefly to learn English. Some were drafted, young men who happened to be living and working in the United States and as residents were subject to conscription.
Some call these Canadians the unknown warriors, men who for years have not called attention to themselves because of the war's unpopularity. Now they are seeking some national recognition, in the form of a memorial to their dead on a few square feet of federal land in Ottawa. But the Canadian Government will not give them the land.
"We're not trying to say the war was right or wrong," said Lee Hitchins, president of the Canadian Vietnam Veterans Coalition. "We just want to put up something for the people who gave their lives."
 
Canada Wasn't in the War
 The Government's reason for saying "no" is that Canada did not officially take part in the war, and does not memorialize people who fought in wars in which it was not a participant.
"The people who chose to participate did so on their own," said Marie Christine Lilkoff, spokeswoman for Prime Minister Jean Chretien.
But that may not be the end of the story. Early this month, Canada's Senate authorized a memorial and called on the House of Commons to unite with it and urge the Government to provide the federal land.
"It's time to accept that Canadian Vietnam War veterans are a part of our history," said Senator Jack Marshall, a Conservative from western Newfoundland. "They cannot and should not be ignored or forgotten any longer."
Senator Marshall, a World War II veteran, was the prime mover behind the resolution, which was supported by many veterans groups here.
 
'Wanted to See the World'
 Mr. Hitchins, a 49-year-old mobile home industry official, joined the United States Navy in 1963 at age 18. He enlisted with two buddies in Buffalo -- "we were young and wanted to see the world" -- and ended up as an electrician on the destroyer Charles S. Sperry in the South China Sea and the Gulf of Tonkin.
He estimates that about 40 percent of the Canadian veterans were draftees. American draft laws at the time applied to Canadians and other aliens, who between the ages of 18 and 26 had to register within six months of their entry into the United States.
Fred Gaffen, senior historian at the Canadian War Museum, said a "couple of thousand" young men returned to Canada to avoid being called up. But he noted that "most who were drafted served."
Mr. Gaffen, author of a book about the Canadian Vietnam experience called "Unknown Warriors" (Dundern Press), said many Canadians, especially those who fled Hungary and other Soviet satellites, were motivated by a desire to fight Communism.
"You have to see it as a product of the times," he observed.
The Canadian Government did nothing to stem the flow, even though a law on the books since the Spanish Civil War, the Foreign Enlistment Act, specifically banned enlistments in foreign armies.
 
Billions Sold to Pentagon
 "The Government made a political decision to turn a blind eye to that law," said Mr. Gaffen, pointing to Canada's heavy economic involvement in the war. Canadian companies sold the Pentagon $2.5 billion of war materiel, including ammunition, napalm, aircraft engines and explosives.
About $10 billion more was exported in food, beverages, berets and boots for the troops, as well as nickel, copper, lead, brass and oil for shell casings, wiring, plate armor and military transport, according to an entry in the Canadian Encyclopedia. During the war period, Canada's unemployment rate fell to a record low of 3.9 percent.
The Canadian veterans are eligible for most of the United States benefits available to American veterans, including treatment for exposure to Agent Orange, the chemical defoliant thought to be responsible for cancerous tumors and other severe medical complications experienced by some who served in Vietnam. Every Remembrance Day, comparable to Veterans Day in the United States, the men of the Ottawa chapter of the Vietnam Veterans Coalition hold a service for Gordon P. Eadie, a draftee from their area killed in action and buried in the small town of Carp, 10 miles west of Ottawa. He had lived in Detroit, where his father worked.
The 58,132 names engraved in the black granite of the Vietnam Memorial in Washington include Canadians, but just how many is still open to question. Many Canadians were identified from towns in the United States where they enlisted or were drafted. Gordon Eadie is listed from Detroit on the Vietnam memorial.
 
At Least 113 Killed
 The current official count is 113 Canadians killed, including 7 missing in action who are presumed dead. The Vietnam veterans group, which is now going through a painstaking check of all the names on the memorial in Washington, believes that it will find as many as 400 born in Canada. There is no accurate count of the number of wounded, but estimates range up to 1,000.
The veterans coalition, composed of 5,000 members in 14 chapters across the country, already has its memorial, an 11-foot-high structure, also of black granite, which will list the names of the Canadian dead and where they fell in Vietnam -- with room to add more names as they are confirmed.
The monument, built at a cost of $100,000, was donated by members of the Michigan Association of Concerned Veterans as a tribute to Canadian comrades.
With their memorial already in hand, the Canadian veterans expected that the Government would readily agree to a site. "We just wanted to bring our brothers home to a respected place in Ottawa," said Mike Ruggiero, who was with the First Marine Air Wing in Danang and Chulai in 1963 and is now director of the Toronto chapter of the coalition.
The veterans point out that Canada has dedicated a memorial at Arlington National Cemetery across the Potomac from the White House to the thousands of Americans who volunteered to fight with Canada and the other Allies in World War I and World War II, before the United States joined the conflicts.
 
'To Respect Canadian Ways'
 But in early May the Chretien Government turned down the request for a site on federal land. Questioned about the rejection in the House of Commons, Michel Dupuy, the Minister of Canadian Heritage, said, "We are going to respect Canadian ways."
Quebec has now gone its separate way. For five years it has had its own memorial, a slab of granite flanked by two blocks of marble, honoring its soldiers in Vietnam, many of them Mohawk Indians who volunteered. Moved once, the memorial is now in a park near the St. Lawrence Seaway in the town of Melocheville, about 20 miles west of Montreal.
Jacques Gendron, who served in the 330 Transportation Unit outside Saigon in 1964 and 1965 and is now president of the Quebec chapter of the coalition, said there was no controversy in Quebec.
"We decided to do it, and it was done," he said.

HEADLINE: First Out of the Chute: Bob Dole

 BODY:
Guess who's talking about running for the Republican Presidential nomination in 1996? Bob Dole. Mr. Dole has come in for plenty of criticism here for sabotaging President Clinton's economic stimulus package and for his purblind opposition to campaign finance reform. Still, the Kansas Senator is a serious public servant and a warrior. We welcome his interest.
To which we add this thought: Let the Republican games begin. If nothing else, Mr. Dole's decision to hire political strategists and start raising money should awaken his party and force other potential candidates to show their hands. Moreover, it might concentrate the attention of the White House on the fact that Mr. Clinton does not look exactly like a lock for re-election. 
 Mr. Dole is a maddening figure. Few people possess his energy, mordant humor, legislative skills, command of complex issues and gifts for political deal-making. Conversely, few share his talent for self-destruction, traceable mainly to a bad temper and a reflexive instinct for the jugular.
His campaigns for the nomination in 1980 and 1988 were essentially one-man shows, poorly organized. As Gerald Ford's running mate in 1976, he managed to blame the Democrats for all of America's 20th-century war casualties. Many people still attribute Mr. Ford's narrow loss to Bob Dole's strident behavior.
Even his fellow Republicans find him abrasive. In 1971, Senator William Saxbe of Ohio described Mr. Dole as a "hatchetman who couldn't sell beer on a troop ship." One suspects, however, that their distemper is also related to Mr. Dole's ideological unpredictability. Make no mistake: he is a partisan Republican and a mainstream conservative on issues like spending and defense. Still, despite a generalized hostility to costly programs, he has shown flashes of compassion for society's outcasts.
He has regularly supported increases in food stamps and child nutrition, for instance, and he worked hard for passage of the Americans With Disabilities Act. "I don't see too many people in wheelchairs showing up at our meetings," he once told his Republican colleagues. He can also claim substantial credit for saving the Social Security system from bankruptcy in the mid-1980's.
Bob Dole won two Bronze Stars and permanently lost the use of his right arm during a firefight in World War II. He is one of the few remaining politicians from a Depression-era generation that produced the Mondales, the Humphreys, the Carters, the Nixons and the Reagans of this world.
Mr. Dole will be 71 next month and would be 73 on Inauguration Day. Too old? "You can be old at 50," Mr. Dole says. The younger contenders in his party -- Jack Kemp, Phil Gramm and Dan Quayle, to name a few -- would be foolish to take him lightly. This is a man who got so mad at his political consultant in 1980 that he sued him.

Straight At Stonewall

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH 

 BODY:
In which New York newspaper or magazine gay-people-are-everywhere story did you read the following last week? "They acquired unprecedented prominence throughout the city. . . . They became the subject of newspaper headlines, Broadway dramas, films and novels."
None. The passage was written by George Chauncey, a historian at the University of Chicago, in an extraordinary new book, "Gay New York." And Mr. Chauncey is not talking about the New York of 1994, where as many as a million gay men and lesbians are gathering for this weekend's Gay Games and next weekend's 25th anniversary of the fabled Stonewall rebellion, the politically liberating Greenwich Village riot prompted by a police raid on a gay bar. 
 No, Mr. Chauncey is instead describing the city's "forgotten gay world" of the years before World War II -- where anti-gay laws were "enforced only irregularly," and where many heterosexual New Yorkers regarded their gay neighbors with "indifference or curiosity, rather than hostility or fear."
That was New York in 1930? Then what happened between 1930 and 1969 to make Stonewall and the modern gay and lesbian movement it fostered necessary?
This is a question I find inescapable this week, as I join millions of other New Yorkers in accepting the lowly role of straight wallflower at New York's nonstop gay ball. Even if it's not our party, heterosexuals might wrest our own meaning from the Stonewall anniversary if only we try to understand why and how our world made a gay revolution inevitable.
There is no more eye-opening spur to such reflection than "Gay New York," which is one of the most fascinating works of American social history I've ever read. Because his subject was long ignored by professional historians, Mr. Chauncey had to begin his anthropological dig into the gay New York of 1890 to 1940 almost from scratch -- by mining mountains of court records and district attorney files, forgotten periodicals, diaries and oral histories to reconstruct detail by detail a thriving gay world reaching from Harlem to the Bowery, from the intellectual elite to the immigrant working class.
The bygone urban landscape he scrupulously documents, gay and straight, is as vivid as E. L. Doctorow's. But entertaining as it is to read about what once really went on in Automats or about how some popular gay vaudeville gags resurfaced unabashedly in Bugs Bunny-Elmer Fudd cartoons, "Gay New York" is not nostalgia. It takes us back not to a past we remember but to a past that was erased from history. Who knew that straight and openly gay American men long ago shared bars and friendship?
Mr. Chauncey's revelations about this century match the bombshells in "Same-Sex Unions in Premodern Europe," the new book by the Yale historian John Boswell offering proof that churches performed ceremonies sanctifying same-sex unions of some sort (if not definitively a sexual sort) as early as the eighth century. No sooner were Mr. Boswell's findings given widespread circulation by Garry Trudeau in "Doonesbury" than two Illinois newspapers banned the comic strip.
Why are some heterosexuals still so threatened not just by homosexuality but even by the revelation that their ancestors might have tolerated homosexuals? Why do we have so much invested in this particular bigotry? In "Gay New York," Mr. Chauncey finds an economic motive for straight New York's abrupt increase in its efforts to segregate and persecute gay New York in the 1930's: men of the Depression, psychologically emasculated by unemployment, felt they could bolster their masculine self-image by demonizing that of others.
And that legacy lingered. Almost every straight boy of my post-Depression generation tormented a gay person on the way to adulthood. The new scholars of gay history show that such cruel behavior can't easily be blamed on historical or religious precedent but only on our own minds and hearts; it is we who stigmatized gay people to shore up our own, embattled definitions of manhood.
Those days are not yet over. But if the Stonewall party belongs to those who escaped the closet over the past 25 years, it is also a timely invitation for those heterosexuals who built the closet to escape their own past. Must we wait a quarter-century to commemorate the liberation of straight New York?

HEADLINE: How the Federal Reserve Sets Policy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "History Upholds Fed's Rate Moves" (Viewpoints, May 29), Stuart E. Weiner fixes the natural rate of unemployment at a remarkably precise 6.75 percent. This figure neatly justifies the four interest rate increases made by the Federal Reserve the last few months despite any evidence of inflationary movement. 
 But Mr. Weiner has not seen fit to enlighten us as to what factors enter into his calculation or how long any unemployment rate in the complex and constantly changing American economic kaleidoscope can be regarded as "natural."
Mr. Weiner acknowledges that appreciable unemployment "represents substantial economic, social and human costs." His proposed remedy is that "policy makers should try to lower those costs through education and job training programs and reductions in employer mandates." But the job market is a shifting sand dune, and job openings do not wait for the completion of such efforts. Instead, the Fed ought to do some benefit-cost research to compare the relative costs of joblessness versus inflation of less than runaway proportions and to identify what groups bear the heaviest burdens.

HEADLINE: How the Federal Reserve Sets Policy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Next to national security, nothing affects Americans as much as decisions by the Federal Reserve. Nothing has a more universal and compelling impact on the cost of living than do interest rates, but it is difficult to comprehend the Fed's decision-making process concerning rates. 
 When the Fed pushed down short-term interest rates in 1992, a big reason was to help the banking industry recover from tremendous losses on real estate loans. Low short-term rates widened the spread between the rates the banks paid depositors and the rates they charged borrowers. The low cost of funds also enabled banks to invest in medium-term securities. Banks were able to restore their battered balance sheets, even though the total amount of loans on their books stopped growing.
I cannot understand why the Federal Reserve would reduce interest rates in the Reagan-Bush years, when the debt and deficit increased, yet raise rates in the Clinton term, when the President is trying to trim entitlements and spending and raise taxes.
The history of the Fed is not one of successful economic policies. Where was the watchful eye of the Fed when the stock market crashed in 1929? Where was the Fed in the early 1930's when the banks were closed because of abuse and the lack of effective controls? How could the Fed permit the interest rate on the long bond to increase to 14 1/2 percent in 1981? Has the Fed supplied any convincing evidence that it was not substantially at fault in the recent savings and loan crisis? The Fed has an entire arsenal of weapons to use against irresponsible and dangerous banking practices; has it effectively used approaches other than interest rates to monitor and stabilize the monetary system and the economy?

Christopher Street: Changes Sweep the Gay Mecca

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
IT was once known as Skinner Road, hewing to an ancient dirt path that Indians used to carry lobsters and oysters inland from a cove on the Hudson. By 1799, it had been renamed Christopher Street.
For most of its modern existence, Christopher Street was a working-class enclave, filled with longshoremen and their families. 
 But long before the police raided the Stonewall Inn in Sheridan Square in the summer of 1969, the street had a thriving, though largely unseen, gay night life. As early as the 1940's, some longtime residents say, a bar called the Colony catered to a gay clientele at Christopher and Gay Streets, attracting a crowd that had migrated from night-time pick-up areas like Washington Square West.
Since the mid-1970's, the street has been known virtually worldwide as the mecca of gay life in New York City and, indeed, in the United States, rivaled only by Polk Street in San Francisco.
"If you wanted to be on a street with other gay people, Christopher Street was it," says Eric Marcus, 35 years old, who has written several books about gay life. "There was nothing like it."
Now, mirroring changes in the gay community as a whole, the street is in transition.
Thousands of people who once packed its bars and stores have died as a result of AIDS. The disease has likewise hit the ranks of those who ran gay-oriented businesses, meaning that the storefronts have a less outwardly gay character than they had a decade ago.
But the street has changed most dramatically, many say, because much of gay culture no longer has to cloister, or ghettoize, itself, a development embodied by the Gay Games and Stonewall celebration this week. Perhaps nothing is more emblematic of the wider acceptance than the tour buses that show out-of-towners the more popular gay bars.
"As society at large has accepted homosexual patterns and people, the need for a secluded gay cruising area has sort of gone away," says Terry Miller, author of "Greenwich Village and How It Got That Way" (Crown, 1990).
What that means for Christopher Street is that, increasingly, gay people in their 20's and 30's are living and socializing in Chelsea and other areas, and gay businesses are following them.
But even as these people gravitate to other areas, others keep coming for the same reasons the earlier generation came: refuge. A wave of younger gay people -- mostly male, minority teen-agers from outside Manhattan -- is discovering Christopher Street, congregating toward the western end and claiming it as their own.
"White gay men can go to a lot of other places -- Park Slope, Chelsea -- and blend in very well with their dinner parties and couples walking to the Laundromat and everything," said Wade Hanley, 21, who is from Harlem. "But we can't really hang out on the corner where we live, so we come here. This is where I feel comfortable."
But whether their presence takes hold depends on economics and an emerging tension with the surrounding community.
"Christopher Street seems to me to be a street looking for an identity, a street that doesn't know what it's going to be in 10 or 20 years," Mr. Marcus says. "It will be interesting to watch."

Wedding Band

BYLINE: By BRYAN MILLER 

 BODY:
AFTER 27 years of playing at countless weddings, Stuart White has confronted every type of nuptial disaster.
"I've had a family member drop dead on the dance floor, serious fights with people flying over tables, even two nuns slugging it out at the table," Mr. White said. "My one rule when disaster strikes is: Play music!" 
 His rule came in handy several years ago when a young groom broke a promise to his bride that he would not smoke marijuana on their wedding day. During the cake-cutting, she smelled the telltale smoke.
"The next thing I heard was somebody shout, 'Oh my God, she slugged him!' " With bride fleeing, groom reeling, parents palpitating and guests gawking, Mr. White had the band strike up "Get on Your Feet," an uptempo dance song by Gloria Estefan, while he persuaded the bride to return.
A percussionist by trade and vice chairman of Steven Scott Productions, a consortium of 30 bands and event producers, Stuart White attends more June weddings than the average priest or rabbi. The company, a musical McDonald's of the matrimonial set,will provide entertainment for at least 142 weddings this month.
In the last few weeks, he has conducted a 12-piece orchestra at a Greek-Venezuelan wedding reception at the St. Regis; a 25-piece band at a 300-person reception in Port Chester, N.Y., and an 18-piece group at a reception in Smithtown, L.I., complete with a flashing fiber-optic curtain.
"If you do weddings you have to be able to provide every possible kind of music," said Mr. White, whose own appearance bespeaks differing styles: from the front, his gray hair is cropped short; the back is worn in a braided pony tail. "The wrong music, the wrong song, can ruin the party for a lot of people."
Mr. White tries to make certain that nothing of the sort occurs at his events. "I'm a detail freak," he said during a conversation the other day at his sleek West 57th Street office. He interviews couples several times before the wedding and even goes so far as to provide samples of classical music for the ceremony.
Couples trying to economize might do better with individual orchestras, but the risks are higher and the opportunities for different music more limited. Steven Scott Productions employs more than 300 professional musicians, representing everything from classical to Cajun. There are no average prices for wedding music: it can be as low as $600 for a jazz trio or as high as the $275,000 spent for a Manhattan wedding last summer that involved a 50-piece orchestra, three full rehearsals, custom outfits and lighting that rivaled a rock concert.
If a couple yearns for Sinatra, Mr. White, in the name of "personal service," reaches into his musical bullpen and produces a vocalist, say Tom Smith of Queens, who sounds eerily like the original (although there is no physical resemblance). Salsa? No problem. He might send out a nine-piece Latin troupe called Fiesta.
Mr. White, the son of a percussion player, joined the company in 1967, six years after it was founded by two bandleaders, Marvin Kurz and Sy Menchin, whose children were named Steven and Scott. The company is now run by a bandleader, Joey Mills, along with Mr. White and 14 partners, all musicians.
While Steven Scott Productions specializes in weddings and bar mitzvahs in the New York area, it also takes on bigger, more prestigious projects. Its bands participated in President Clinton's inaugural parties, the Statue of Liberty Centennial and numerous Super Bowls. The company expects to send bands to about 4,500 events in 1994, with billings of more than $10 million.
On a recent Saturday night, Mr. White assembled a big band for a 300-guest Italian wedding at the Rye Town Hilton, up in Westchester. Mr. White, in white jacket and bolo tie, led the three singers (plus "Mr. Sinatra," five horns, nine violins, keyboard, percussion, guitar, bass, congas and harp).
The band performed a peppy set of top-40 tunes from the last 20 years, moving fluidly from Michael Jackson to Andrew Lloyd Webber. The crowd streamed onto the dance floor. John and Margaret Retoske, waving their arms above their heads while remaining still from the knees down as if glued to the wood floor, gave the band high marks.
"We've been married 56 years," he said. "This is great, just great."
Most Steven Scott musicians interviewed said they enjoyed the weddings almost as much as the guests did, not only for the good pay (from $300 to $500 a party, up to $60,000 a year), but also for the receptive audiences.
"At weddings you have to play all kinds of music -- jazz, standards, R and B -- and it really keeps your chops up," said John-Martin Green, a vocalist with long braided hair and a quick smile. "And the audience is always rooting for you. They always want to have a good time."
Any musician who has worked weddings for some time would probably say that musical trends last about as long as the average American marriage. "In the 70's, it was very contemporary, with a lot of disco," Mr. White said. "In the 80's, it got more mellow, and now there is a big return to classics like Nat Cole, Tony Bennett and Sinatra."
Mr. Smith, the Sinatra singer, added, "To see young artists doing those old songs makes it legitimate for many people." The most popular wedding song this year, the musicians said, is Nat King Cole's version of "It Had to Be You."
At 10 P.M., the party was rocking, black ties yanked off, well-coiffed hair tumbling down. The band was churning out a 70's disco medley while the two female singers jogged in place as if they were on a treadmill.
"I've been doing this for 22 years," said Steve Goldstein, the sound man. "At this time in the party they always go for this disco stuff."
At half past midnight, the horns were finally packed away. Mr. White took a deep breath, and the honeymoon couple started to get ready for the long flight to Hawaii.

HEADLINE: Organizing a City: A Celebration From A to Z

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

 BODY:
LAST month, Mayor Giuliani asked his Labor Commissioner to have a quiet talk with George M. Steinbrenner, the Yankees' owner, about what was good for the city.
What was good for the city, the Mayor wanted Mr. Steinbrenner to know, was to let 10,400 gay and lesbian athletes parade through Yankee Stadium for the closing ceremonies of the Gay Games IV and Cultural Festival, an eight-day Olympic-style competition meant to break down stereotypes about homosexuality. 
 Mr. Steinbrenner had rejected requests from Gay Games organizers for months, arguing that he could not risk harming the field during the baseball season and that the Yankees, who lease the stadium from the city, had already promised it that weekend to the Catholic High Schools Baseball Championship.
But after some gentle pressure from the Commissioner, Randy L. Levine, who until a few months before had represented the Yankees as a private lawyer, the combative baseball boss suddenly changed his mind, city and Yankee officials said. (No one will say why Mr. Steinbrenner had a change of heart, though it cannot be ignored that angering the Mayor would not be in Mr. Steinbrenner's interest while the Yankees are negotiating with the city about a host of financial issues.)
The unexpected intervention by a Republican Mayor who prides himself on being a diehard Yankee fan and a product of Catholic schools was but one of an incalculable number of political and diplomatic efforts, logistical maneuvers, business deals and intellectual and artistic enterprises that will coalesce this week in what organizers are billing as the largest tribute to homosexuality in the history of the city, if not the world.
Beginning last night, and for the next seven days, the city will become a playing field not only for the Gay Games but for the celebration of the 25th anniversary of the Stonewall uprising, the 1969 clash between transvestites and the police that marked the beginning of the gay-rights movement. From this base, the prodigious talents and resources of New York's gay world have spun off a vast array of performances, fairs, parties, exhibitions and dances that will turn lower Manhattan into something akin to a weeklong festival of gayness, culminating next Sunday in the Stonewall march and rally in Central Park.
These celebrations, in turn, will coincide with the opening local matches of the 1994 soccer World Cup just across the Hudson in the New Jersey Meadowlands.
If all goes as planned, about 1.2 million people from across the nation and from more than 60 countries -- a crowd that would rival those that gathered for the Bicentennial in 1976 and Liberty Weekend a decade later -- will be feted, fed, domiciled and entertained in an operation that would challenge Napoleon Bonaparte's talents.
Much is at stake for Mr. Giuliani's administration and for the city itself. Not only is New York's vaunted reputation for keeping order and handling vast events on the line, but also its reputation as the most tolerant and diverse metropolis in the world. Organizers of the Goodwill Games, to be held in New York in 1998, are watching closely.
How all this came to pass is not, of course, simply a lesson in logistics, albeit logistics of imperial proportions. The history of the making of this event -- a gay festival that seems certain to rouse much of the nation's largest city, and many of its "straight" citizens, from the routines of daily life -- is also a social, political and economic statement subject to a variety of interpretations.
Asked about Mr. Giuliani's actions on behalf of the games, his press secretary, Cristyne Lategano, said they had not been motivated by politics.
"He's treating them as he would treat anyone else," Ms. Lategano said. "His motivation is to showcase New York. He's not a moralist."
But it is certainly true that Mr. Giuliani has had to balance his desire to win supporters among gay men and lesbians against a possible backlash from some of his core supporters, some of whom are religiously or morally opposed to homosexuality. Gay men and lesbians voted 2 to 1 against Mr. Giuliani in the last election, according to exit polls. Late last week, the administration announced that the Mayor had decided to give a short speech at the opening ceremonies of the games last night.
For gay men and lesbians, the months of preparations have revealed divisions within their body politic. There have been bitter disagreements between different gay-rights groups about the route of the Stonewall march, and debates have sprung up about the importance of the games, which some more radical homosexuals feel have commercialized their movement.
In these debates, a deeper disagreement has emerged about the future of a movement that began with Stonewall. Should it mobilize to fight human-rights abuses against gay people around the world, or should it seek to escalate the fight against AIDS?
Beyond this divide, though, all but the most radical participants would probably share a common cry, organizers say -- that the floods of gay people will send an indisputable message to the world through its media capital that gay people are everywhere, look much like everyone else and should be accepted, protected by law and treasured.
"We are your mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers and grandmothers and your cousins," said Pat Norman, a co-chairman of the march organization, Stonewall 25. "Believe me, we are family."
The games were begun in San Francisco in 1982 by a former Olympic decathlete, Tom Waddel. The first games were relatively modest, with about 1,300 athletes, but they have grown steadily. This year's games will bring in 10,400 athletes from 40 countries for 30 sports, from billiards and bowling to traditional Olympic endeavors like track and wrestling.
From the beginning, one of the driving purposes of the games, which are open to heterosexuals as well, has been to show the world a different image of homosexuals than the limp-wristed and fey stereotype.
The push to bring the Gay Games to New York began humbly enough in 1989, when Thomas Cracovia, a bodybuilder and a lifetime competitor in amateur track and field, had lunch with a soccer enthusiast named Karen Merbaum, at the Rio Grande restaurant in Manhattan.
Both had competed in the second Gay Games in 1986 in San Francisco, and both say the experience of performing as openly gay athletes before thousands of accepting fans had changed their lives. But Mr. Cracovia had something else he wanted to talk about, just the spark of an idea really.
"I thought, this thing has become more international," Mr. Cracovia remembered. "Why not bring it to New York?"
"We never thought it would grow to these proportions," Ms. Merbaum recalled.
The two formed a seven-member committee and put together a proposal to sell the Federation of Gay Games on New York when the federation met in Denver in early 1990. They sought out the Mayor at the time, David N. Dinkins, and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, and armed with letters of support, easily beat out Sydney, Australia, in large part because the Stonewall anniversary would coincide with the 1994 games, they said.
Since winning the nod for this year's games, the Gay Games organization in New York has done an impressive job raising money, gaining sponsors and negotiating with the city for high-profile venues. It has grown from a handful of volunteers with a staff of two to an organization that has a paid staff of 70 and occupies three floors of a Chelsea office building.
Much of that expansion was the handiwork of the tenacious and impassioned executive director, Jay Hill, a former sportswriter for Newsweek and ABC News who took over the group in December 1992. "We're a disenfranchised group, so it has been tooth and nail every step of the way," Mr. Hill said.
Under Mr. Hill's leadership, the games raised about $4 million of their $6.5 million budget through a series of fund-raising events across the country. The most successful were a posh dinner last August at the Puck Building, with Martina Navratilova as host, and a "fantasy auction" in January, where contributors bid on donated art or bought things like dinner with Joan Rivers.
But the games also drew about $1.3 million from corporate sponsors and merchandisers who are selling everything from Gay Games T-shirts to candy bars. The biggest corporate sponsors are Miller Brewing, Continental Airlines and Nora Beverages U.S.A., which sells Naya Spring Water. Mr. Hill said many corporations had been leery of a gay stigma, but said he had concentrated on those that had already shown an interest in the market.
The corporate support is a measure of a growing recognition that gay people represent an important and untapped market, the companies' spokesmen said. A recent market survey suggested that gay men and lesbians make up at least 5.7 percent of the nation's population. They also tend to be well-educated, self-employed, and concerned with fitness, and are likely to have more disposable income for luxury items and vacations than heterosexuals with children do.
"You've got a group of people with a certain profile who are as attractive as all get-out to certain clients," said Gunnar Jordan, who heads a marketing firm that represents Naya, which has been advertising in gay magazines since the late 1980's.
Gay groups had boycotted Miller Brewing several years ago for contributing to conservative politicians. But Sophia Nieves, a Miller spokeswoman, said the decision to endorse the games was "pretty cut and dried," a matter of "good business sense" rather than fence-mending. "Our decision doesn't stem from any desire to send out a political message," she said.
But the corporations may also be attracted to the relatively innocuous image of the Gay Games, said some gay advocates in more radical New York City circles. For instance, the logo for the games that appears on Miller Beer banners and ads is a stylized torch with the slogan Unity '94 beneath it. Nowhere does the word "gay" appear.
In addition to corporate sponsors, Mr. Hill and his staff racked up an impressive list of parks, gyms, pools, tennis courts, auditoriums and athletic fields for the events. The games rented Columbia University's Wien Stadium for its opening ceremonies last night and hired facilities at New York University and Hunter and Lehman Colleges. The Paramount Theater was rented for the body- building competition.
With some help from the Dinkins administration, Mr. Hill also managed to obtain several quasi-public facilities, including the National Tennis Center in Queens.
But the vast majority of venues were provided free by the Parks Department, most notably the tumbledown but serviceable Downing Stadium on Randalls Island, for track and field. The last time the parks were used for such a large athletic event was for the 1964 Olympic trials. Parks Commissioner Henry Stern said the Gay Games organization had easily met every requirement for using the venues, including posting bonds and providing sanitation and security.
"We're sort of excited about the games," he said. "It could be a dry run for the Goodwill Games in 1998."
 
FOR THE STONEWALL MARCH, A MUCH ROCKIER PATH
 If the relationship between the city and the Gay Games has been smooth and cooperative, much the opposite has been true of the city's dealings with the organizers of the Stonewall march.
Planning for the march began in 1989 at an international conference of gay-pride organizers in Vancouver. From the beginning, national and international gay-rights groups played a role in shaping the march, and the organizers saw it as an opportunity to throw a spotlight on international human-rights abuses against gay people and to call for their inclusion in the United Nations universal declaration of human rights.
But New York gay-rights groups have tried to shift the focus of the march to the fight against AIDS. They have also argued about the route of the march, saying it should begin at the site of the Stonewall rebellion, on the north side of Sheridan Square, not at the United Nations.
"Stonewall is where it all began," said City Councilman Thomas G. Duane, echoing the views of others in the dissident group. "I wouldn't be on the City Council if there wasn't a Stonewall. There wouldn't be a million openly gay and lesbian peole coming to New York if it wasn't for Stonewall."
But even as the committee organizing the march, Stonewall 25, was riven by internal disputes, it was also plagued by chronic shortages of cash. Organizers said the aggressive fund-raising by the Gay Games had hurt their efforts.
"There has been some confusion out there as people who have given to the Gay Games think the money also benefited us," said Franklin Fry, a co-chairman of the march who was at the center of the negotiations over the route.
Against this backdrop, negotiations with the city did not begin in earnest until early February, Mr. Fry said. At first, the organizers sought four separate march routes to the rally in Central Park, including the one past the U.N., but the city refused, saying such a scheme would paralyze Manhattan.
Fran Reiter, the Deputy Mayor who has largely overseen the city's plans, said the city had raised objections to blocking First Avenue and had concerns about using Central Park, since the Great Lawn could hold no more than 250,000 people, far fewer than the organizers' predicted one million. The administration suggested leading the march south on the F.D.R. Drive to a rally in Battery Park, which the Stonewall 25 committee rejected vehemently.
After two months of failed negotiations, the organizers called in Ethan Geto, a well-known lobbyist and gay-rights advocate, who helped the two sides fashion a compromise.
Shortly after Mr. Geto entered the talks, Mr. Giuliani agreed to give the organizers Central Park and to make every effort to let them march past the United Nations, city officials said. But having ceded those points, the city insisted on a single route.
So, in late May, the organizers reluctantly agreed to a route that would pass up First Avenue, across 57th Street and up Sixth Avenue into Central Park, and to sacrifice Fifth Avenue, the traditional path of annual Gay Pride marches. This concession brought down the ire of the AIDS protest group ACT-UP and several other organizations.
Last Monday, the Stonewall organizers responded to the outcry by proposing a second route beginning at the United Nations, moving west across 42d Street, then north on Fifth Avenue, entering the park at 57th Street. The Giuliani administration rejected the proposal Friday.
To complicate matters further, ACT-UP and dozens of smaller groups have vowed to stage a march along an unauthorized route from the Village to Central Park, prompting suggestions of arrests by the police. The New York Civil Liberties Union has threatened to file a lawsuit tomorrow, saying that to deny the Village gay groups an alternative route is a violation of First Amendment rights.
There has also been friction about the rally itself. Arguing that performances by celebrities could draw larger crowds, the administration has demanded a list of who will speak and insisted that big-name performers not give full-length performances. The organizers have accused the city of trampling their First Amendment rights; the Civil Liberties Union has supported their case.
But city officials say more practical problems are threatening to derail the march. The financial difficulties have made it unclear whether the Stonewall group will be able to post a $50,000 bond for the use of Central Park. And last week, the organizers missed a deadline for finalizing contracts with vendors to provide a stage, portable toilets, security, and a sound system for the rally. Without these, the city had still not issued a permit on Friday.
 
FASHIONING A MECHANISM FROM AN ARRAY OF MOVING PARTS
 The city's planning for the events began more than two years ago and intensified in recent months as the new administration took over and June loomed nearer.
The two thorniest issues have been the route of the Stonewall march and obtaining Yankee Stadium for the Gay Games ceremony. But beyond those negotiations, the logistical choreography has had myriad mundane parts that could spell the difference between disaster and a smooth operation.
For the most part, responsibility for the city's plans was placed in the hands of Ms. Reiter, who in turn oversaw a small cadre of longtime civil servants with experience running special events from the Police, Emergency Medical Service, and Parks, Fire and Sanitation Departments.
"You really want to take every possibility into account," Ms. Reiter said. "This has been a serious exercise so that people can have a lot of fun."
Ms. Reiter would not speculate about how much the events would cost the city, though it is safe to say overtime will reach into tens of millions of dollars. The Stonewall march alone will require 4,600 police officers. But officials expect more than $500 million to be spent by visitors to the city, Ms. Reiter said.
To begin with, the Police Department took unusual measures to diminish the chance of a clash between officers and gay advocates or between gay tourists and soccer enthusiasts.
The police were so worried about conflicts between soccer fans and the Gay Games spectators that they have assigned extra patrols in Manhattan all week. And in March, the police called a meeting to ask consuls from World Cup countries to educate their citizens about New York's gay-bashing laws, Inspector Thomas Mullen said.
"We told them they might see things that they think are obnoxious and that what might be hijinks in one country could be a bias crime in New York," Inspector Mullen said.
From the middle of June until mid-July, the police will establish safe corridors on 23d Street and Eighth Avenue in Chelsea, with an officer on every block to provide secure passage to gay clubs. The department also trained and equipped seven special mobile riot units to back up regular officers in case of bar fights or riots, Inspector Mullen said.
For the rank and file, the department produced a special training film intended to explain gay life styles and compelled all officers to watch it at roll call in the last two weeks. In addition, each officer was given a new booklet with answers to questions gay visitors might ask, like the locations of gay community groups.
Besides public safety, perhaps the biggest logistical headache has been to keep the city moving. While the Transit Authority has dedicated extra trains and buses, the Transportation Department plans to have at least 150 extra traffic agents and other officials monitoring for backups and traffic jams.
Transportation officials are also trying to find ways to minimize the congestion in Manhattan on July 26, the day of the Stonewall march. And general traffic problems may be worsened should the strike on the Long Island Rail Road continue.
"The month of June is not a month to drive your car into Manhattan," said Gregory Perrin, the Transportation Department's director of special events.
Even in the preparations, not everything has gone smoothly. At the last minute, the city refused to grant a permit to the Gay and Lesbian Vistors Center, a Chelsea tourist company, for a street fair next Saturday on Eighth Avenue between 14th and 23d Streets. The center had already spent tens of thousands of dollars preparing for the event, which had the support of the local community board and businesses and had attracted sponsors like Coors Beer and Coca Cola.
But city officials decided that it would cost too much to police yet another fair, and that blocking off Eighth Avenue when much of the Village was already closed to cars would create a traffic disaster.
In the end, officials said, the entire week has an air of uncertainty about it. Many gay groups are planning wildcat marches and demonstrations. For instance, the Church Ladies for Choice, a transvestite organization, plans to march Friday night from Tompkins Square to Sheridan Square. And a radical feminist group, the Lesbian Avengers, is vowing to hold an unauthorized "International Dyke March" down Fifth Avenue from 42d Street to Washington Square on Saturday night. Neither has a permit.
"The nightmares that develop are usually the ones you don't anticipate," said Mr. Stern, the Parks Commissioner, as he reflected on the uncertainty surrounding the Stonewall rally. "Anything you do is likely to be distorted by some group, so you might was well try to do the right thing."

HEADLINE: RECORDINGS VIEW;
A Brash Kid No More: The Maturing of a Maestro

BYLINE: By DAVID SCHIFF; David Schiff is a composer who teaches at Reed College in Portland, Ore.

 BODY:
IF YOU THINK MICHAEL Tilson Thomas is still that brash kid looking over Leonard Bernstein's shoulder, you probably have not kept up with his recordings. But it hasn't been easy to do so. Mr. Thomas's recorded output is scattered on six different labels, and many of his fine early recordings are out of print or have been reissued in confusing repackagings. Mr. Thomas has recorded with many orchestras -- though mainly with the London Symphony, of which he has been principal conductor since 1988, and the New World Symphony, his superb training orchestra in Miami Beach.
An overview of his recordings reveals that the "kid," who turns 50 in December and is soon to become music director of the San Francisco Symphony, has become a mature and distinctive maestro. 
 Mr. Thomas is audibly American in his style of conducting and his choice of repertory. More than 20 years ago, he established his national credentials with impressive recordings of Ives and Ruggles (on Deutsche Grammophon). He has since recorded the complete orchestral music of Ruggles (CBS; sadly out of print) and nearly all of Ives's orchestral works (Sony).
At the pop end of the American spectrum his high-spirited recordings of Gershwin include the first performance of "Rhapsody in Blue" to use Gershwin's piano roll and the original Whiteman arrangement, and a rapturously celebratory album of songs with Sarah Vaughan, which could serve as a definition of American music (CBS). "Tangazo," Mr. Thomas's recent album of Latin American classical music with the New World Symphony (Argo), shows his prescient awareness of the ever-changing mix of American culture.
But what has always set Mr. Thomas apart is his dual allegiance to modernist music, particularly the American avant-garde, and Broadway. His theatrical bent comes from his family heritage -- the famed Yiddish actor Boris Thomashevsky was his paternal grandfather -- but also from his close associations with Ira Gershwin and Bernstein.
His flair for reconciling the diverse stylistic strains of the Broadway idiom is clear in his recordings of Gershwin's "Of Thee I Sing" and the less familiar "Let Them Eat Cake" (CBS) and of Bernstein's "On the Town" (Deutsche Grammophon). Mr. Thomas has a superb sense of the period flavor of these works, and he brings out the naive worldliness of the Gershwin shows and the big-band swagger and wartime anxiety of the Bernstein.
Mr. Thomas's modernist roots are equally distinctive. He grew up in the Los Angeles of Arnold Schoenberg and Igor Stravinsky. He was present at many of Stravinsky's recording sessions, and even before he studied with Bernstein, he served as Pierre Boulez's assistant at the Ojai Festival in California. In the 70's he conducted the Buffalo Philharmonic when that orchestra was synonymous with avant-garde experiment. Two of his early recordings were a literally smashing performance of the piano duet version of "The Rite of Spring," and the proto-Minimalist "Four Organs" by Steve Reich, then unknown, whose work Mr. Thomas continues to champion (EMI/Angel).
Although he has remained remarkably faithful to these roots, the conductor who emerges on the recent recordings has a wider range of repertory and a greater subtlety of interpretation than the young Thomas. Recent Sony recordings of works by Brahms, Debussy and Stravinsky (with the London Symphony) reveal the mature Thomas at his most distinctive. These recordings share a luminous sound quality, a fresh attention to details of sonority and texture, and an unstoppable rhythmic verve.
Much the way Brahms waited until middle age to write his First Symphony, Mr. Thomas has so far recorded all the Brahms orchestral music except the warhorse symphonies and concertos. He makes a strong case for approaching the more familiar works through the two youthful serenades (SK 45932, 47195). They are really symphonies in disguise, or to put it another way, they announce Brahms's intention to redefine the symphony in terms of chamber music.
Mr. Thomas respects the belated Classicism of these Romantic works. His approach is spacious and unhurried yet flavorsome. He brings out the rich undertones of stylistic allusions, a little Hungarian here, a little Viennese there, echoes of Haydn, Schubert and Mendelssohn, which give these works their particular charm. But the sonority of the wind instruments gives the most pleasure here, for they carry most of the melodic burden.
Both as soloists and as an ensemble, the wind section of the London Symphony plays with warmth, elegance and superb intonation. Who said Brahms couldn't orchestrate?
Sonority is also the focus of Mr. Thomas's recording of Debussy's "Martyrdom of St. Sebastian" (SK 48240); indeed, a listener may want to spend a weekend or two just wallowing in the physical seductiveness of the sound. This work, written as incidental music for an erotically charged mystery play by Gabriele d'Annunzio, has long been the ugly duckling among Debussy's works, rejected by many of his admirers as an economically motivated reversion to the ersatz religion of Wagner's "Parsifal." At best, it has been praised for its stained-glass orchestration; it has most often been performed as an orchestral suite without its controversial text.
Charles Munch's haunting narration on his 1956 recording with the Boston Symphony revealed the dramatic power behind the orchestral glow, but Mr. Thomas, who uses every scrap of music Debussy wrote for the play, finally unveils the full emotional range of this anguished yet tender masterpiece.
The powerful presence of Leslie Caron in the speaking role of Sebastian is the key to Mr. Thomas's success here. As in Strauss's "Rosenkavalier," composed at the same time, the music is saturated by the giddy sound of women's voices, most notably in the shining high soprano of Sylvia McNair. Restoring Sebastian to its original trouser -- or rather, loincloth -- role further brings out the free-floating sexual ambiguity of the play and the music, and underscores its symbolic nature. "The Martyrdom" is less a martyrology than a great elegy for the death of beauty. From its opening woodwind chord, more beautifully organlike than any organ, to its ecstatic closing "Alleluia," the music is a glory of sound.
A quite different "Alleluia" concludes Stravinsky's "Symphony of Psalms," heard with his Symphony in C and Symphony in Three Movements on Mr. Thomas's most recent Sony release (SK 53275). With Stravinsky, Mr. Thomas returns to his musical childhood, and the performances appear at first to follow Stravinsky's own recordings very closely.
Yet a comparison soon reveals important differences. Many of Stravinsky's performances, though perfectly paced and sharply articulated, were, well, sloppy. His Symphony in Three Movements is full of bloopers and splats that for this listener become more distracting with every passing year. Mr. Thomas's performances offer a Stravinskian rhythmic panache with a fine finish.
Whether these recordings will finally place all three works in the symphonic repertory is another question. The Symphony in C, even as beautifully played as it is here, remains strangely reticent. Stravinsky himself pointed to the stylistic split between its European and American movements (the work was begun in France and finished in the United States), but the music is perhaps covertly Russian. The first and last movements begin with allusions to Tchaikovsky's first and last symphonies, and despite its Classical title, the symphony does not really engage the Classical tradition but often sounds like a private conversation between Stravinsky and Tchaikovsky.
The Symphony in Three Movements, by contrast, is Stravinsky's most American work and also one of the few that according to the composer, engages with contemporary historical events, in this case World War II. Much of the third movement in particular seems to anticipate "West Side Story." (Or is it echoing "Fancy Free," written the year before?) Mr. Thomas captures the postwar euphoria of the last movement, yet the work, which was cobbled together out of several unused film scores, continues to sound more like a great ballet -- as Balanchine realized -- than a symphony.
DESPITE THE RICH inventiveness of the two instrumental symphonies, the "Symphony of Psalms" remains the only one of Stravinsky's later works to win over the concert audience. Listeners have felt that here Stravinsky dropped the masks and manners through which he distanced much of his music.
Mr. Thomas fully takes advantage of the opportunity to get beneath the stylistic surface. His performance is tensely dramatic, following Stravinsky's very precise progress of religious moods from despair through hope to peace.
The opening of the third movement captures a feeling I had never heard in Stravinsky's performances. In Hebrew the word "kavanah" signifies a spiritual readiness for prayer. At the beginning of the third movement, a setting of Psalm 150, the chorus prepares itself for an ultimate song of praise. Mr. Thomas imbues this music with "kavanah." It sounds both anticipatory and calm, as if the singers already knew the goal of the purgatorial struggle that would lead them to the paradise of the final "Alleluia."

HEADLINE: REAGAN'S REVENGE -- AS INVENTED BY HOWARD JARVIS

BYLINE: By Alan Brinkley; Alan Brinkley is a professor of American history at Columbia University and the author of "The Transformation of New Deal Liberalism," to be published next year by Knopf.

 BODY:
Presodent Clinton no doubt remembers 1978 as the year he was first elected Governor of Arkansas. But historians may well point to another event that year with an even more important impact on the President's subsequent career: a tax revolt in California that continues, 16 years later, to haunt the American political landscape.
The impact of the tax revolt -- and of the fiscal crisis it helped create -- is particularly visible in the Clinton Administration's two major domestic initiatives of 1994. The fate of the President's health care reform may well rest on his ability to persuade Congress and the electorate that employer mandates are not a tax. And the Administration's welfare reform plan is being crippled by Congressional requirements that new expenditures be accompanied by new revenues (something the President is unlikely to request after the trauma of the 1993 budget fight) or equivalent reductions in related programs. 
 And so Administration officials astonish themselves by contemplating a kind of social cannibalism: raids on such hitherto sacrosanct liberal programs as food stamps, Medicare, public assistance to legal immigrants and aid for the homeless. The first Administration in nearly 30 years with an expansive view of Government's power to do good finds itself imprisoned within a fiscal environment that makes it difficult for Government to do anything.
THE MOST VISIBLE ORIGINS OF CLINTON'S predicament lies in the fiscal policies of the Reagan Administration and the enormous structural deficits they helped produced. But the Reagan policies themselves had their origins in an important shift in conservative strategy in the 1970's, when a talented group of right-wing organizers channeled the widespread economic and political frustrations of their time into a revolt against taxes. For a short time, the most prominent figure in that effort was Howard Jarvis, a retired California businessman who orchestrated the stunning 2-to-1 victory of Proposition 13 -- the 1978 ballot initiative requiring a significant reduction of his state's property taxes.
Jarvis had spent more than a decade leading futile antitax crusades in California before 1978. Like other right-wing figures, he fought against taxes not just because he thought they were too high but because he opposed the Government programs they supported. At various times he had called for ending public financing for such services as parks, libraries, garbage collection and schools. He had opposed Social Security and Medicare. Because of these stands, he remained on the fringes of mainstream politics. But in the late 1970's -- as property tax levies in California soared and as popular cynicism about politics grew -- Jarvis and others adopted a new strategy. They separated the issue of taxes from the issue of what taxes support. That became the key not only to the success of Proposition 13 but to much of the "Reagan Revolution" of 1981.
For generations, American conservative leaders -- from Herbert Hoover to Barry Goldwater -- had appealed for support by warning of the dangers Government programs posed to individual freedom. But attacking Government programs had failed to topple the liberal order. Almost everyone had a stake in some of them. The biggest and most expensive programs -- Social Security, Medicare, veterans' benefits and others -- had the strongest support. In 1978, therefore, the supporters of Proposition 13 prudently de-emphasized their hostility to Government services. They refrained from attacking the public schools, parks and libraries. They even largely spared the welfare system.
They based their crusade instead on two related complaints. First, they emphasized the cost to individuals of high taxes. In his self-congratulatory 1979 memoir, "I'm Mad as Hell," Jarvis described friends and acquaintances whom he claimed had literally died as a result of their tax burdens -- among them a woman who dropped dead of a heart attack in the city office in Los Angeles "in the very act of pleading about the prohibitive level of property taxes on her home."
Second, and more significantly, they attacked the governing class -- and its supposed extravagance, inefficiency and corruption. Satirical cartoons showed public works employees idling away the day, sitting on the curb next to their work sites or filling in a hole they had pointlessly dug the week before. "There is more than enough money to pay for services," Howard Jarvis insisted shortly after his victory in 1978 (somewhat hypocritically, since he himself did not really believe in many of the services he was citing). "The bureaucrats have just squandered it."
The overwhelming victory of Proposition 13 spawned successful tax reduction campaigns in nearly a dozen other states. But its most important impact was probably on the thinking of some national conservative leaders, who found in the tax revolt a vehicle for ending their nearly 50 years in the political wilderness. What if you could attack taxes (and the politicians who spend them) without engaging in Barry Goldwater's self-destructive questioning of widely admired programs like Social Security? What if you could, in effect, promise voters something for nothing: substantial tax relief without a reduction of services? That, essentially, is what Proposition 13 had promised Californians in 1978. Two years later, it was what Ronald Reagan promised the nation.
The tax revolt moved rapidly, and along many fronts, from local to national politics. Articulate economic commentators like George Gilder and Jude Wanniski provided an intellectual rationale. They created a new, inverted version of Keynesianism ("supply side economics"), dressed it up in academic language and published it in best-selling books and on The Wall Street Journal's editorial page. By cutting taxes on the wealthy, they claimed, Government would help produce so much economic growth that tax revenues would not decline. They might even increase.
In 1980, Ronald Reagan -- who through most of his career had been more interested in opposing Communism than in attacking taxes -- made a major tax reduction one of the economic centerpieces of his Presidential campaign. The other centerpiece was an attack on the Federal deficit ($59 billion in 1980) and the national debt (then $914 billion).
The magnitude of Reagan's victory cowed skeptical members of Congress into supporting a program that many of them had recently dismissed as economic nonsense. The new Administration quickly won approval of virtually everything it wanted: a 25 percent reduction in tax rates, substantial cuts in supposedly wasteful domestic programs and an enormous increase in the military budget. Concern about budget deficits, still a staple of Reagan's oratory, receded deep into the background of actual policy. As Reagan's budget director, David Stockman, indiscreetly conceded to the journalist William Greider in late 1981, the leaders of the Reagan Administration never made a serious effort to tackle the deficit once they realized, as they did very early, that their original assumptions about the impact of tax cuts were wrong. Twelve years later, the annual deficit had grown to over $300 billion and the national debt to over $3 trillion.
THE TAX CUT WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO increase the deficit. But many of its supporters were not very troubled when it did. Major figures in the Reagan Administration, unlike many of the people who had voted for them, had no faith in Government and no love for its programs. Some began quietly to see real advantages in the skyrocketing debt. The fiscal crisis became a back door for doing what many on the right had been unable to achieve with their frontal assaults in the 1950's and 1960's. It undercut support for starting new Government programs, and even for sustaining old ones, less by discrediting the programs than by pitting them against the need to reduce a huge and growing national debt.
The legacy of the tax revolt, and of the stupefying public debts it helped generate, is a fiscal world in which the boundaries of the possible have been dramatically constricted. But there is another legacy, too. The tax revolt was a product, in part, of a growing cynicism about politics and politicians. Its results, ironically, have greatly increased that cynicism.
Voters endorsed the implausible promise that Government could simultaneously cut taxes, sustain services and reduce the deficit. Supply-siders told them that tax cuts would increase, not diminish, public revenues. Others predicted that eliminating "waste, fraud and abuse" would compensate for the shrunken tax base. The intractable fiscal crises of the 1980's and 1990's have proved both those arguments to be fantasies. But rather than recognizing the claims of the tax revolt as the false promises they were, voters have heaped even more opprobrium on politicians for failing to deliver the impossible.
President Clinton evidently thought that a serious effort to address the fiscal crisis would open some political space for new policy initiatives. Events may yet prove him right. It seems likely, however, that whatever space there may be will be very small and that whatever initiatives may emerge from this Administration will be shaped fundamentally by fiscal constraints.
As a result, the President faces an unenviable set of choices. He can continue proposing such important and ambitious new programs as health care and welfare reform without asking for significant new taxes to support them -- a course that has already begun to pit cherished liberal goals against one another. He can ask for new revenues to pay for his ideas -- a frontal challenge to the political orthodoxy of the 1980's, which seems unlikely to succeed. Or, as appears most probable, he can make enough concessions and compromises to get greatly weakened versions of his proposals passed, claim victory and hope that they can become the basis (as the Social Security Act of 1935 did) of more generous and comprehensive programs later on.
The President wants his Administration to be a dramatic break with the Republican past. It took more than 30 years for conservatives to shake the grip of Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal. President Clinton has considerably less time than that to shake the grip of the legacy of Ronald Reagan and Howard Jarvis.

HEADLINE: In Death of Rain Forests, We're All Accomplices

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Last Rain Forest: Timber vs. a Culture," your special report on Papua New Guinea (front page, June 5), provides an excellent overview of threats to that remote Pacific island country's forests and communities. You also identify community-based efforts to use forests in an ecologically responsible way as an alternative to the corrupt and destructive practices of foreign loggers.
Unfortunately, you leave the mistaken impression that the reforms supported by the Minister for Forests, Tim Neville, will remedy the situation and create space for more community-based, ecologically sustainable forest management. 
 But Mr. Neville and the National Forest Authority model their proposals on industrial Canadian forestry practices that are not ecologically sound or socially equitable. Central to these reforms is establishment of timber supply areas, which guarantee investors access to timber in return for investments in downstream processing facilities such as plywood, veneer and pulp mills.
Adopting such a model will again restrict cash-poor customary landholders from using and benefiting from their own resources, and place Papua New Guinea on the same centralized, revenue-driven development track that has led to destruction of forests and the livelihood of forest people throughout the world.
Your article aptly demonstrates how this destructive trend is moving from Southeast Asia to Papua New Guinea. However, it does not highlight the need for industrialized countries, the major consumers of wood products, to take responsibility for a role in fueling such unsustainable development. It is unfortunate that here in the United States efforts to take such responsibility are not a priority.
The United States Agency for International Development recently shut down its offices for the South Pacific region in Papua New Guinea and Fiji, cutting off our Government's ability to support community-based, ecologically responsible forest management. Also, Vice President Al Gore's meeting with Mr. Neville this year appears to have resulted in few concrete actions to redirect the course of forest management in Papua New Guinea.
When Mr. Gore was a senator, he sponsored a bill requiring labeling of wood products so consumers could base their purchasing on sound information. This bill never passed. Now Mr. Gore should follow up his efforts by having the Administration fully back legislation that mandates the inclusion of consumer information on wood origin and species, as well as on the ecological and social impacts of the production of wood products.

HEADLINE: U.S. Treasury to Offer $68.5 Billion in Debt This Week

 BODY:
The Treasury's financings this week are scheduled to bring a large supply of Government paper to market, but analysts said on Friday that they did not expect the move to weigh too heavily on prices. On the contrary, the analysts noted, during the last month investors had shown interest in the short to intermediate maturities, as yields were down as much as 15 basis points on some maturities and nearly unchanged on the longer end.
The total amount of Government debt being offered this week is $68.5 billion, including today's $24 billion auction of three- and six-month bills. On Tuesday, the Treasury will auction $17 billion of two-year notes, and on Wednesday it will auction $11 billion in five-year notes. On Thursday, $16.5 billion of one-year bills will complete the week's supply of new issues. 
 At the close of the New York cash market on Friday, traders said, the rate on the outstanding three-month bill was 4.10 percent and the rate on the six-month issue was 4.45 percent, with a one-year issue at 4.89 percent. In when-issued trading last week, ahead of this week's auction, the new two-year issues were offered at a price to yield 5.91 percent, while the five-year notes were offered at a price to yield 6.71 percent.
The following taxable and tax-exempt fixed-income issues are scheduled for pricing this week:

HEADLINE: In Poor, Decolonized Africa, Bankers Are New Overlords

SERIES: Survival Test: Can Africa Rebound? -- Second of three articles.

BYLINE: By JOHN DARNTON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ACCRA, Ghana

 BODY:
For more than a decade the economies of Africa have been caught in a relentless downward spiral. As a result, countries that are proud of their independence and prickly about sovereignty are finding themselves more than ever under the thumb of outside powers.
Only now the powers are not the old colonial masters -- Britain, France and the other would-be exploiters who carved up Africa in European drawing rooms and conference halls in the 1880's. 
 Nor are they the United States and the Soviet Union, which cast covetous eyes upon the continent in the mid-1970's and turned it into an arena for cold war confrontation by proxy.
Now the external superpowers are the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. These institutions, founded half a century ago at the Bretton Woods Conference to serve the needs of the industrialized world, have become the overlords of Africa in the 1990's.
Gone are the days 10 and 15 years ago when socialism was "on the march" and powerful leaders from the despotic to the high-minded gave it lip service. They embraced it because a controlled economy fit well with one-man rule that brooked no opposition, because egalitarianism seemed progressive and right for Africa and because only the Communist countries were backing liberation movements in the south.
"Today you won't find a single African head of state who stands on a podium and declares: 'I'm a Marxist,' " observed Tei Mante, a Ghanaian who heads the African office of the International Finance Corporation, an affiliate of the World Bank. "Instead all the talk is about floating currency, private enterprise, and getting hold of capital."
The I.M.F. and the World Bank are the purveyors of the new orthodoxy. They come in to bail out a country that is bankrupt. They do so by drawing up a "structural adjustment program," a tight package of economic prescriptions designed to bring about free market enterprise and minimize governmental interference.
Because the package is tied to millions of dollars in aid from Western donor countries, it is an offer that can't be refused. And so the I.M.F. and the bank end up calling the shots on a broad range of issues -- even political matters like calling multiparty elections -- that affect the lives of millions.
Through its structural adjustment programs, the I.M.F. and the bank now effectively oversee and supervise the economies of some 30 countries in sub-Saharan Africa.
It is hard to exaggerate the depth of Africa's economic crisis.
Consider this fact: Excluding South Africa, the 1991 gross national product of all countries south of the Sahara -- a swath of the globe that is home to almost 600 million people -- was about the same as the gross national product of Belgium, with a population of 10 million.
Eighteen of the world's 20 poorest countries are African, and 30 of the poorest 40. Caught in a downward cycle that began with the oil price explosion of the 1970's and then accelerated with the plunge of the commodities markets, they are getting poorer still. Per capita G.N.P. declined by 2 percent a year throughout the 1980's.
Their debt, tripled since 1980, now amounts to over $180 billion. The debt burden -- caused by borrowing to keep budgets afloat and to pay for imports -- is so gigantic (amounting to 110 percent of G.N.P. in 1991) that virtually no one thinks the sum can ever be repaid. Just servicing it costs the countries $10 billion every year -- four times more than they all spend on health and education.
Africa's share of world trade has fallen below 4 percent and is now closer to 2 percent. That is so marginal it is almost as if the continent has curled up and disappeared from the map of international shipping lanes and airline routes that rope together Europe, North America and the booming Far East. Direct foreign investment in Africa is so paltry it is not even measured in the latest World Bank study.
 
The Cure
Harsh Medicine For a Sick Region
 Despite the evident need for resuscitation, the role of the I.M.F. and World Bank, as might be expected, is controversial. The medicine they dole out means currency devaluations, slashing government payrolls and cutbacks on subsidies, even for food. The burden of the long climb back to fiscal respectability falls mainly on the poor, though experts contend that in the long run the poor will benefit when the economies improve.
A main object of the program is to reduce inflation in order to improve the balance of trade, attract investment and give farmers and entrepreneurs an incentive to grow produce and make products. In the short run this means lower wages and rising unemployment, but these are necessary evils to achieve real growth, most economists and experts say.
There are dissidents. Kevin Watkins, the senior policy adviser for Oxfam, the British relief agency, attacked the bank and the I.M.F. two months ago in an article in The New Statesman. He argued that structural adjustment and its "preoccupation" with monetary discipline was failing to generate economic recovery in Africa and instead was simply imposing unbearable social costs on the poor.
Bank officials point to Ghana as a laboratory for their policies. Under the sway of its charismatic leader, Jerry Rawlings, who hung up his flight lieutenant's uniform and easily got himself elected President two years ago, Ghana subscribes to the new orthodoxy more than any other country.
Now, its streets are congested with traffic, its balance of trade figures are improving, its stock market id bubbling along and attracting foreign investors. The famous 100-year-old Ashanti Goldfields are a case in point. Two decades ago the mines were in a slump. Now, after careful management, outside investment and major refurbishing, gold production has tripled since 1986, surpassing cocoa as the chief export earner. The company was just privatized, with the Government selling half of its 55 per cent ownership -- a controversial move delayed by a lawsuit on the grounds that too much was being given over to foreigners.
Despite the signs of progress, however, many miners say they skip lunch below ground because they cannot afford the meal. Like other Ghanaians, they have been hurt because the spending power of the cedi, the nation's currency, has not really improved. The per capita income -- about $420 a year -- stubbornly remains among the lowest in Africa.
 
The Reaction
Africans Divided Over Austerity
 Leaders like Kenya's demagogic President, Daniel arap Moi, publicly rail against the I.M.F. and the bank -- "We cannot continue swallowing their medicine all the time," he thundered several weeks ago -- while privately caving in to their terms. Every day Africans from taxi drivers to schoolteachers argue knowledgeably -- and heatedly -- about the bank's stand in forcing a currency devaluation or abolishing a corn marketing board.
"I think of the World Bank as some kind of monster," said Monique Ilboudo, a 27-year-old lawyer, writer and ardent feminist, sipping a drink in the parched shade of a baobab tree in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. "It sits on top of Africa like an octopus, sucking us dry. It never looks to see the effects on the lives of the people. It treats us like numbers, economic agents."
Others defend the bank as a necessary evil, something to shoulder the blame for decisions too painful for the governments to make themselves. It is at least a lifeline, they say.
"Yes, at times you feel you are giving away your sovereignty and your independence," said Tsatsu Tsikata, chairman of the Ghana National Petroleum Corporation, as he sat on a hotel balcony within earshot of six-foot-high waves crashing down on Ghana's Gold Coast.
"You wonder if it's not going too far," he said, "especially when some of their staff take on this patronizing approach to Africa -- the impression that we can't get our act together and that they have to step in and set everything right. So it's easy to denounce the bank. Even the right-wing opposition does it. But that kind of jingoism doesn't work in our situation when you're desperate and you need external resources. We have to live in the real world."
 
The Prognosis
Great Potential, Puzzling History
 And yet, despite its desperation, Africa has great riches. It has the gushing oil fields of Nigeria, the thick veins of copper of Zambia, diamonds that flow down the rivers of Angola to settle in the alluvial seabed. Most of all, it has the world's largest reservoir of arable land -- almost 2.5 billion acres, of which only one-fifth is cultivated.
How to reconcile the utopian potential with the hard realities of declining growth is the obsession of almost every African government and the preoccupation of the World Bank and the I.M.F. The reasons cited for failure are many and endlessly debated, ranging from corruption and mismanagement to built-in trade inequities, a legacy of colonial relationships.
But the challenge is vexing because other third world countries manage to achieve growth. In 1965 Indonesia's per capita G.N.P. was lower than Nigeria's and today it is three times higher. Virtually no strategy adopted by any African country -- whether encouraging foreign companies or taking over their assets, whether trying to force industrialization or relying mainly on agriculture -- has succeeded.
Until now, perhaps.
In a report published in March, the most comprehensive one on Africa it has yet produced, the World Bank suggested that not all was hopeless. It studied 29 countries, dividing them into those that more or less faithfully carried out austerity measures and economic reforms and those that dragged their feet. It concluded that the high performers were beginning to see modest growth.
It put Ghana at the head of a list of six countries that it said were gradually rolling back the red ink through their I.M.F.-inspired economic policies. The others were Tanzania, Gambia, Burkina Faso, Nigeria and Zimbabwe (though Nigeria's military government has since abandoned the program).
The World Bank report cautioned not to expect miracles. Even if Ghana manages to keep going at the current rate -- squeezing out a per capita growth rate of about 2 percent a year -- then "the average Ghanaian will not cross the poverty line for another 50 years," it said.
In more general terms, if the most optimistic growth forecasts prove accurate, it will take 40 years for the African countries to regain the per capita income level they reached in the mid-1970's.
This prediction sent a chill through the hearts of many African leaders. The answer to a shrinking belly is more belt-tightening, it seemed to be saying, and it's going to have to go on for generations.
 
The Pioneer
On Roller Coaster Since Freedom
 Ghana's role as star pupil seems fitting. For Ghana began black Africa's postwar adventure in independence under the fiery inspiration of Kwame Nkrumah in 1957 and since then has seen just about everything.
There have been five coups, some bloodless and some bloody. There have been three tries at civilian rule. There were those initial years of big-time spending, when the Nkrumah regime went through $481 million in foreign reserves to erect grand projects and grandiose monuments. And there were those long, dog days of the early 1980's when drought devastated the cocoa fields, Nigeria expelled 1 million Ghanaian workers, the Ambassador Hotel downtown had only a 25-watt bulb in each room, and even the local Star Beer was hard to come by.
In 1983, Ghana adopted a structural adjustment plan. Its terms were typically severe: devaluation of the hopelessly overvalued cedi, privatization of most of the 300 state-owned industries, a lifting of restrictions such as import licenses in order to lure foreign investors and open up trade, abolition of agricultural marketing boards so that farmers could get better prices for their produce, and large-scale layoffs of state employees, including 45,000 from the Civil Service lists alone.
Ghana has more or less stuck to the plan. From 1988 to 1992 its economy grew by between 4 and 5 percent annually, a credible showing. The exception was in 1992, when declining international cocoa prices and the temptation to spread Governmental largesse during elections threw the budget back into deficit. Aid flows from the World Bank were held up until the Government got its program back on track.
Now, signs of activity are perking up. There are traffic jams on the dusty streets, crowds around the ubiquitous red, green and yellow lottery shacks, vendors everywhere hawking magazines and carrying trays of bananas, cigarettes, watches and pirated tape cassettes on their heads.
Farmers are growing more cocoa. Supermarkets are stocked with goods. Electronic stores have appliances, video cameras and computers in the windows, though not many consumers can afford them. The G.N.P. per person -- about $450 -- is still among the continent's lowest.
There is a slight stirring of interest among foreign companies. Lonrho, the London-based conglomerate with extensive holdings in mining, agriculture and hotels throughout Africa, has bought a majority shareholding in the Ashanti Goldfields. Starkist Tuna, J.C. Penney, Coca-Cola and several South African companies are committed to or contemplating business ventures. And Morgan Stanley expects to invest in Ghana over the next few weeks.
But most of all, there's an optimism among Ghanaians. They feel that things are getting better, slowly but surely. This is true not just in the cities but in the countryside, where 80 percent of the country's 15 million people live and where poverty is the most grinding.
The ears of international financial experts would have been burning if they could have listened the other day to the chief of the tiny village of Doryum, about an hour northeast of the capital. After pouring a libation of schnapps onto the ground, the chief, Nene La Nimo Doryumu II, invited a visitor into a reception room at his house decorated with calendars. He wanted to chat.
"People's lives are definitely getting better," he said, seated in his robes with a sheepskin mat at his feet. "A lot of people go to school now, those who can afford the fees. We've been promised electricity by the end of the year. If there's electricity, maybe the young people won't all go off to Accra."
Western donors are so hungry for a success story in Africa that they suppress the nervousness they feel at President Rawlings's populist pronouncements and his tendency to swamp the opposition by sheer force of personality and swagger.
The donors have been pouring aid into Ghana at roughly the rate of $1 billion a year. That sum is such a pump to the economy that it is hardly fair to say that Ghana could serve as a role model to lead the rest of Africa out of the economic doldrums. It would be impossible to support other countries to the same extent, experts note.
 
The Debate
Help for Needy, Or for Wealthy?
 Critics of the World Bank argue that it really represents the interests of the creditor nations and that its dictates are delivered with neo-colonialist hauteur. The terms are so severe that in some cases they are tantamount to destabilizing a country or asking its leader to commit political suicide.
Cutting Civil Service payrolls means losing the leverage of patronage and creating unemployment. Charging for medical services that used to be free means the poorest will go without them. Reducing subsidies and relaxing price controls sows discontent in the congested cities.
When the cost of bread rose in 1990 in Zambia after an I.M.F.-imposed program, there were riots in the streets and the country backed away from the plan. January's drastic devaluation of the French-backed C.F.A. franc touched off labor disputes, demonstrations and violent clashes that are still shaking 14 French-speaking countries throughout West and Central Africa.
"Most of the criticism of the bank is deserved," said Jonathan Moyo, a professor of political science at the University of Zimbabwe. "But what are we looking for? These are two Bretton Woods institutions. They were created to manage international financial crises, not to manage individual countries.
"Of course they're insensitive," said. "Of course the structural adjustment programs can become a cause of social chaos. How can a country going through the throes of social change and under weak leadership sustain such a program?"
An even more frightening prospect, some African leaders admit privately, is that the pain that the reforms inflict may exacerbate ethnic tensions, which seem to be on the rise in many parts of the continent.
One Ghanaian official, speaking anonymously, said he could not rule out a connection between the social repercussions of the program and a series of ethnic clashes that began in northern Ghana in February. So far some 350 villages have been burned to the ground, with several thousand people killed and an estimated 150,000 displaced.
If a country abandons an austerity plan, it runs the risk of being cut off from all international aid. This is currently happening to Zaire.
In this, former President Julius Nyerere of Tanzania, who pursued economic policies that were disastrous for his country but who is sometimes called the "conscience of Africa" for his principled stands, sees a sort of blackmail.
"The I.M.F. has an ideology of political and social development which it is trying to impose on poor countries irrespective of their own clearly stated policies," he said in an interview with Stephen Riley, a British academic who specializes in African affairs. "And when we reject I.M.F. conditions we hear the threatening whisper: 'Without accepting our conditions you will not get any money, and you will get no other money.' "
On the other side, proponents argue that there is simply no alternative to the I.M.F.'s conditions if growth is to be achieved again.
"Adjustment can be a difficult and painful process and the benefits not immediately apparent, making it politically difficult for governments to stay the course of reforms," said Babacar Ndiaye, president of the African Development Bank. "But reforms are the only way forward."
Herman Cohen, who served four years as Assistant Secretary of State for Africa under George Bush, agrees. "The I.M.F. was created to tide industrial nations over when they had temporary balance of payment problems," he noted. "Now suddenly it's thrust into the developing world pit. Then the World Bank gets involved to push long-term projects.
"They've gone crazy. But no one else could impose the discipline and do what's got to be done. So I subscribe 100 percent to structural adjustment. There just is no other way to go."
 
TODAY Bailing out the bankrupt, and a laboratory for optimism.
 
YESTERDAY Poverty, misery and despair: the deadly legacy of decline.
 
TOMORROW From one-man rule to multiparty government, but at a price.

Companies
 Donna Karan's fashion empire is now plagued by turmoil: partners want to sell out, retailers are complaining, bankers are worried. Her rapid success and the recent problems afflicting her company compose a familiar pattern in the American fashion industry, where family businesses frequently grow beyond the founders' ability to manage them. [Page A1.] 
 Philip Morris's chairman and chief executive unexpectedly resigned. The departure of Michael A. Miles comes less than a month after directors wrangled over and rejected a proposal to divide the company into separate food and tobacco units. [D1.]
The zealousness of Saturn owners has been skillfully cultivated by the auto company. And the "homecoming" in Spring Hill, Tenn., later this week -- a hoedown of some 25,000 Saturn owners -- may be the most audacious attempt yet by the G.M. subsidiary to cement the fevered loyalty of its customers. [D1.]
Lawyers for investors in Towers Financial contend that the lawyers, accountants, brokers and credit analysts who worked for the conglomerate were responsible for Towers' alleged fraud. The lawyers say their case has been helped by a recent Supreme Court decision. Federal prosecutors have charged that Towers was the vehicle by which Steven Hoffenberg defrauded investors of more than $450 million between 1988 and 1993. [D1.]
 
The Media Business
C-Span has been cut back on cable systems serving more than four million households as a result of the cable law passed by Congress two years ago. The new law forced many cable systems to add local broadcast channels, and a large number of the systems have chosen to drop C-Span and its sister channel, C-Span 2, to make room for more profitable channels.

Comcast will acquire Maclean Hunter's U.S. cable TV systems for $1.27 billion in cash. Comcast won a bidding war for the cable systems, picking up 550,000 subscribers in New Jersey, Florida and Michigan. The deal would make Comcast the third-largest cable company in the United States. [D1.]
A double issue of The New Yorker devoted to fiction comes out this week. The issue -- which has been given a big promotional push, including planes trailing beach banners -- is a throwback to a time when fiction was a staple of mainstream magazines. [D5.]

HEADLINE: Preserving the History That Lies Underfoot;
Bluestone Sidewalks on Comeback Trail

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
John Buscarello of Brooklyn learned about bricks and stones and mortar from his father, Jack, following him into the family masonry business. As a matter of course, he learned how to install the massive slabs of bluestone, many the size of dining room tables, that a century ago were the city's dominant sidewalk material.
But the bluestone trade faded to almost nothing over his father's generation, and for years the only sidewalks Mr. Buscarello installed were concrete. The giant slabs of gray rock, which over time subtly show colors like red and green and azure, appeared to be going the way of gaslights, bowler hats and the 3-cent cigar. 
 The path toward extinction has been the same for other old-time paving materials -- the granite sidewalks of SoHo and TriBeCa; the red brick streets of Queens; the Belgian block, commonly called cobblestone, of lower Manhattan and dockside neighborhoods in Brooklyn, all inexorably fading away.
But bluestone, indigenous to neighborhoods like Brooklyn Heights and Park Slope, seems to be making a comeback. Prompted by pressure from the city to fix decrepit sidewalks of all types, and after years of campaigning by preservationists, many more property owners are making the historically correct choice and creating a bluestone boomlet.
More of the material is being repaired than ever before, contractors say. Mr. Buscarello, who says his bluestone installations have increased 80 percent since last year, has a waiting list of 25 jobs. Small bluestone quarries in New York State also report an increase in calls from the city.
Preservationists estimate that bluestone made up half the city's sidewalks at one time, chiefly areas near the harbor that were developed first, while today it accounts for just 5 percent. But they say hundreds of sidewalk strips have been renovated in the last two years, and that bluestone has been used in major new restoration projects like Bryant Park.
Lurching progress is also being made in setting up new city contracting procedures that would lower prices and make installation easier. Cost is still a stumbling block, and many home owners in historic districts, where sidewalks must be replaced with bluestone or concrete tinted to look like it, have complained about having to pay almost four times the cost of poured concrete.
In April, Park Slope won a promise from the City Department of Transportation that it would not rip out any more bluestone in areas adjacent to historic districts until the new procedures are established. "There's a new awareness of the value of the materials themselves, the streets, the sidewalks, the curbs -- both for appearance and longevity," said Franny Eberhart, executive director of the Historic Districts Council.
Bruce Mesh, vice president of the Park Slope Civic Council, said, "This is esthetics becoming economics, of using historic preservation as a means of building our community."
Bluestone, a sedimentary rock, has long been popular for patios and counter tops, but the renewed demand is for the enormous pieces, some as large as 5 by 5 feet, used in old-fashioned sidewalks. Some slabs weigh in at 2,000 pounds easily.
"It's more like there's been a revival of a particular breed of bluestone, the big slabs," said David Andersen, who owns Pascack Valley Stone and Slate Company in Closter, N.J.
Though the movement to save the material began in Brooklyn Heights, Park Slope and other neighborhoods in brownstone Brooklyn, proponents say interest has spread to areas with a bluestone heritage in Harlem; Long Island City, Queens; Yorkville on the Upper East Side, and Staten Island.
 
City Sends Contractors
 The revival is being catalyzed by stick and carrot. The stick is violations issued by the Department of Transportation to property owners whose walks have been heaved about by tree roots or erosion. Owners have 45 days to fix them or the city sends contractors in to do the job and sends owners the bill. Though the city offers bluestone replacement, the cost is four times the $4.81 per square foot it charges for pouring concrete.
The carrot has been leniency in enforcing violations until the transportation agency adjusts its bidding procedures.
"We're trying to accommodate the community on this," said Michael Weiss, the department's chief of staff.
The Historic Districts Council and the Park Slope Civic Council have also compiled a list of contractors who do bluestone work. City Council members from Brooklyn are working with the Department of Transportation to find a large lot for private contractors to store bluestone, as space for the rocks is a growing problem. A lot owned by the transportation agency in the Flatlands section of Brooklyn is being considered.
Though prices have fallen with demand and bluestone is considered more durable than concrete, the chief factor working against bluestone is still cost. People already angry with having to fix sidewalks at their own expense are not eager to multiply the cost by choosing a historic material. Accordingly, most people choose concrete, Mr. Mesh says.
Mr. Buscarello says he charges about $800 to pour a 10-by-20-foot patch of concrete, compared with $3,000 for a similar area of new bluestone. To lift and adjust existing bluestone and add a few new pieces costs about $1,200 for the same space.
"And stone is not a renewable resource," warns Richard Mirch, owner of the Tompkins Bluestone Company in Hancock, N.Y., a major supplier to local contractors. "As it is used up, it becomes less available. Therefore, the price goes up."
People say they are finding better deals by skirting the city government. Amy Kallman Epstein, who owns a brownstone in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, was quoted a price of $18,000 by the city to fix her bluestone, more than six times the charge for concrete. With the help of the Park Slope Civic Council, she got the job done for a price close to what the concrete would have cost.
"It's not the easiest thing to do, this re-creation of the 19th century," she said. "But it's important for chunks of New York to be the way they were as much as humanly possible."
Nicole Loveland, who publishes books about cats and and lives in Park Slope, was outraged when she was hit with notice of a sidewalk violation last fall. "Push came to shove, and we were going to get grief from the city, so we said, 'Well, fine.' "
She got together with two neighbors, and the three secured a contract to have the work done for less than $1,000 each, using new stone and patching existing material. "It looks quite fabulous," she said.
Michael Kaye, a lawyer, says he resented being forced to correct a violation at his Park Slope home. It cost him $700 to keep his slabs of history, but he says it was worth it. "The charm of a neighborhood like this is sort of incremental," he said. "Every little thing sort of adds up."
 
 
 
GLIMPSES OF STONES FROM THE PAST
 Concrete has been the preference for New York sidewalks and streets since the turn of the century. But glimpses of the stones of the past are still to be found.
BLUESTONE Often confused with slate, the dark stone is quarried in the Catskills and Poconos. It can still be seen in Brooklyn's brownstone neighborhoods, lower Manhattan, Harlem, Long Island City in Queens and the northern part of Staten Island.
GRANITE SLABS Blocks of granite, 6 by 8 feet, were quarried throughout New England and used for sidewalks in the downtown manufacturing neighborhoods of SoHo and TriBeCa. Many slabs, so thick that they also form the curbs, are still in place, as they are virtually indestructible.
BELGIAN BLOCK The material, commonly known as cobblestone, is granite, but in smaller blocks, generally 8 to 12 inches long and 5 inches in width and depth. It was used in most streets in lower Manhattan and on the West Side, as well as in older parts of Staten Island. Small patches peek through later paving, and some stretches have been restored.
RED BRICK Used in parts of Queens, patches are visible on some entrances to the Grand Central Parkway.

HEADLINE: Carter, His Own Emissary, Outpaces White House

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 19

 BODY:
Jimmy Carter was not exactly a submissive emissary.
Indeed, the former President said today that he would never have sought permission to go to North Korea if he had supported the Clinton Administration's plan to use economic sanctions against its Government in the dispute over its nuclear program. 
 He said he still found it "inconceivable" that President Clinton had not sent his own delegation to North Korea to try to resolve the standoff between the two countries.
And yet it was Mr. Carter who emerged from the White House this morning after briefing Administration aides to proclaim that the promises made to him by North Korea's reclusive leaders meant that the crisis was in effect over.
The White House expressed hope today that Mr. Carter might have opened the way to a breakthrough. But after a weeklong "private" visit that became a public spectacle, aides to Mr. Clinton spoke of their consternation that Mr. Carter's faith in conflict resolution made him too eager to accept assurances from a Government that has built no basis in trust.
And so a trip that was set in motion with a request nearly three weeks ago from Mr. Carter to Mr. Clinton ended, as aides to both men put it, with tense late-night phone calls between Washington and the former President, who had infuriated the White House with statements broadcast worldwide on CNN.
"I wouldn't want to call him naive or gullible," a senior Administration official said today. "But let's just say that we're a lot more skeptical than he is about whether the North Koreans mean what they say."
Mr. Carter said Kim Il Sung, the North Korean leader, had assured him that his nation was not building nuclear weapons, and had offered to freeze his nuclear program as long as high-level talks with Washington are begun and continued.
In his hotel suite here this morning, Mr. Carter was still buoyant even after a flight that took him from South Korea to Atlanta and then to Washington. And he offered no apology for carrying his own views to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital.
"Pressure on them is counterproductive," he said of the North Koreans, expressing hope that his mission might set the Administration on what he sees as a wiser course.
The former President spoke with a sense of achievement about his meetings with the 82-year-old Mr. Kim, in which he said his wife, Rosalynn, had acted as his note-taker.
"I don't know what would have happened today if no one had been willing to talk to anybody in North Korea," Mr. Carter told reporters whom he invited to his room.
For the one-time broker of the Camp David accords, the trip to North was merely the latest in a series of efforts to make good on his pledge to dedicate his life after the Presidency to promoting the peaceful resolution of conflicts.
Since leaving the White House in 1981, Mr. Carter, who is 69, made that goal the central mission of his presidential center in Atlanta. He has acted as an intermediary in conflicts in the Middle East, Africa, the former Yugoslavia and elsewhere.
 
Requests Refused Twice
 But the State Department had twice refused his requests to travel to North Korea in response to a 1991 invitation, and Mr. Clinton's unexpected decision to approve the journey at a time of mounting tensions gave it even more prominence.
Mr. Carter has always sought to play an independent role rather than serve as the emissary of his successors. But with a Democrat in the White House for the first time since he left it, his mission to North Korea was being subjected today to intense partisan scrutiny.
On the ABC News program "This Week," George Will, the conservative columnist, called Mr. Carter's performance "very injurious" and "a reminder of how important and good the 1980 election was."
Both the White House and the former President have emphasized that Mr. Carter was traveling as a "private citizen" during last week's visit. But accounts given today by both Mr. Carter and White House officials made clear that it was preceded by extensive discussions, including a three-hour session on June 5 in which Robert L. Gallucci, the Assistant Secretary of State for Politico-Military Affairs and the Administration's point man on Korea, flew to Atlanta after the former President expressed "extreme concern" about the danger of a confrontation.
Mr. Carter said today that he was still left "distressed" after that meeting and had telephoned Vice President Al Gore the next day to tell him that he was still "strongly inclined" to travel to Pyongyang. Two days later, he said, Mr. Gore relayed word that Mr. Clinton had given the go-ahead.
The former President left no doubt about his motivation for wanting to travel at a time when the White House was seeking agreement at the United Nations to impose sanctions against North Korea.
"If I had thought the sanctions were a good idea, I never would have gone over there," he said.
Today, senior White House officials said that because Mr. Carter was traveling as a private citizen they had believed it was more important to brief him on the Administration's position than to explore his personal views. But they acknowledged that Mr. Carter's expression of those views while traveling had provoked deep frictions, particularly when the former President told CNN from Pyongyang that the Administration was stepping back from its pursuit of sanctions.
Mr. Carter several times today described that statement as a "mistake," and said that he was not presuming to speak for the Administration.
Asked to respond to the criticism of his journey, Mr. Carter said: "I don't feel that I have been duped, but I have to say the proof is in the pudding."

HEADLINE: Liberal Is Elected President In a Tight Race in Colombia

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BOGOTA, COLOMBIA, June 19

 BODY:
Colombian voters elected Ernesto Samper Pizano today in the nation's tightest presidential race in 24 years.
Wth 97 percent of the ballots counted, Mr. Samper, candidate of the Liberal Party, had a slim lead over the Andres Pastrana Arango of the Conservative Party, the elections board announced. Mr. Samper had 50 percent, Mr. Pastrana had 48.4 percent, and 1.6 percent of the ballots were declared invalid. 
 Elected to lead South America's second-most populous nation through the rest of the 1990's, Mr. Samper intends to tap Colombia's pending oil boom to improve social conditions.
"We must improve social spending so that there is no Chiapas in Colombia," Mr. Samper, a rotund 43-year-old economist, said in a recent interview. While last January's guerrilla revolt in southern Mexico sounded alarm bells up and down Latin America, Colombia has long been plagued by guerrilla unrest fed by rural poverty.
Some Colombian business leaders had favored Mr. Pastrana, who had stressed fighting inflation and pushing for Colombia's rapid entry into the North American Free Trade Agreement. But with Colombia's Congress controlled by the Liberal Party, investors openly worried about a legislative deadlock with a Pastrana presidency.
 
A Trend in Latin America
 Mr. Samper's victory appeared to be part of a trend among Latin American voters. Last December, a Social Democrat, Rafael Caldera, was elected President of Venezuela. In Brazil, Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, a socialist, enjoys a strong lead in polls in advance of next October's elections.
To increase living standards in Colombia, Mr. Samper promised voters that he would create 1.5 million new jobs and that he would dramatically raise social spending to 15 percent of the gross national product.
Mr. Samper's program includes investing $1 billion in improving rural infrastructure, investing in highway construction, encouraging the creation of 350,000 small businesses, and spending $1.5 billion for the construction of a subway system for this traffic-choked city.
However, Mr. Samper, a former Minister of Development, has said that he has no intention of rolling back the free market changes adopted by Colombia's outgoing President, Cesar Gaviria Trujillo. The Constitution bars Mr. Gaviria, a Liberal, from succeeding himself.
 
Trade Changes Unlikely
 "The opening has been done, we are not going to review the tariffs, we are not going to close to foreign investment," Mr. Samper said, referring to Colombia's radical opening to foreign trade. In recent years, Colombian import tariffs have dropped from 50 percent to 12 percent today, and the Government has negotiated free trade pacts with 22 nations.
Many of the planned public works are to be paid by revenues from Colombia's Cusiana oil field. The largest oil field discovered in America since the North Slope in Alaska, Cusiana is expected to start providing billions of dollars to Colombia's Government by 1996.
Mr. Samper said that he would tighten the current Government's policy of encouraging drug traffickers to surrender under plea bargains, but would raise minimum sentences.

HEADLINE: On Health, Congress Moves to Take Bold Action Subtly

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 19

 BODY:
If Congress passes a comprehensive health care bill this year, it will require a grand compromise to finesse some tough decisions.
The latest idea for a political compromise on health care legislation calls for a device known as a trigger mechanism. Such a device would defer any requirement that employers provide coverage to their workers for at least several years. 
 During that time, voluntary efforts would be tried to expand coverage. If they failed under one proposal, the requirement, known as an employer mandate, would automatically take effect. Or, under another version of the proposal, Congress would have to reconsider the question and vote on whether to impose the employer mandate.
In the jargon of the health care debate, these proposals are called trigger mechanisms because they could set off the requirement for employers to insure their workers. If it was found that some proportion of Americans lacked health insurance at some future date, this finding would lead to an employer mandate or other action to achieve universal coverage, President Clinton's ultimate goal.
The proposals have attracted attention from senators, especially members of the Finance Committee, who say the panel will not vote to impose an employer mandate now.
In the last decade, Congress has often used mechanistic devices to avoid or finesse tough decisions. One of the best examples was a measure passed in 1985 to reduce the Federal budget deficit in large installments over five years. It set ceilings for the deficit and required automatic cuts in Federal spending if the limit in any year was exceeded. It also called for a balanced budget by 1991, but for various economic and political reasons, Congress never even came close to meeting that goal.
 
Base-Closing Analogy
 Another example is the procedure that Congress established in 1990 to close military bases. An independent commission makes recommendations to the President, who must approve or reject the list of bases to be closed in its entirety. Congress can block the closings only if both houses pass a resolution of disapproval. In two rounds, more than 100 bases have been marked for closing.
On health care, members of Congress have been getting mixed signals from the Administration, with various officials suggesting different degrees of flexibility.
After discussing health care with Mr. Clinton on Tuesday, senators said the President had appeared willing to consider some versions of a trigger mechanism, particularly those with the greatest likelihood of imposing an employer mandate.
But in a speech on the same day, Hillary Rodham Clinton seemed to reject the idea. "There are some who always in the face of controversy look for some way out," Mrs. Clinton said. "It would be as though when they were debating Social Security people started saying: 'Well, that's a good idea, but, you know, we really ought to phase it in. We really ought to try to make sure that the private sector first provides pensions for everybody, and only after we've waited to see whether every company does provide pensions should we do anything to make sure we provide Social Security.' That is not only a very short-term approach; it is one guaranteed to fail."
Some Administration officials say they want to negotiate with Congress on proposals for a trigger mechanism. They say they cannot publicly discuss such proposals before Mr. Clinton does. But they no longer insist that universal coverage must be achieved, as President Clinton originally proposed, by Jan. 1, 1998. The timetable, officials say, is now negotiable.
Still, Robert E. Rubin, assistant to the President for economic policy, said he disagreed with the perception of many people that the White House was showing more flexibility on this question. Roger C. Altman, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, refused to discuss the merits or details of a trigger mechanism.
"What we are seeking is a bill that's passed in 1994 and leads, by its terms, to universal coverage," Mr. Altman said. "I don't see much point in speculating whether this bell or that whistle reduces or enhances the chances of that outcome."
Senators John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, and Bob Packwood, Republican of Oregon, have expressed keen interest in a trigger mechanism. Such proposals assume that the Government can significantly increase coverage without imposing an employer mandate.
About 85 percent of Americans now have health insurance. Mr. Breaux said this figure could be raised to at least 91 percent if the Federal Government prohibited insurers from denying coverage to people with medical problems, subsidized premiums for poor people and took other steps to make insurance more affordable.
Other, less stringent proposals provide that if certain goals for health insurance coverage are not met, the President must submit recommendations to Congress, and Congress would have to consider them under special procedures limiting debate and guaranteeing an up-or-down vote.
White House officials say Mr. Clinton could not accept this approach because it would not guarantee universal coverage. Other people object for other reasons.
Jeffrey H. Joseph, vice president of the Chamber of Commerce of the United States, said, "We are in dead opposition to mandates in any way, shape or form, or any triggers that would give politicians an opportunity to impose mandates."
Candice M. Johnson, a spokeswoman for the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said: "We are opposed to triggers. In order to have real health care reform, you need the employer mandate."
And Representative Sam M. Gibbons, Democrat of Florida, the acting chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said, "Triggers are for guns, not for legislation."

HEADLINE: Learning the Power of Tax Cuts

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TRENTON, June 17

 BODY:
Democratic Party leaders, alarmed by the growing popularity of Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's income tax cuts, admit that, for the time being, they have lost their campaign to convince the public that the Governor's program will lead to dramatically higher local property taxes.
Assembly Minority Leader Joseph V. Doria said last week that Mrs. Whitman has done a remarkable job of hiding what Democrats call the downside of her tax program. 
 "The general public has never seen the connection between her income tax cuts and local property tax increases," Mr. Doria said, adding that Democrats will have to make voters aware of that if they hope to reverse their losses in the latest legislative and gubernatorial elections.
The Senate Minority Leader, John A. Lynch, concurred, and said: "This is the start of a long-term campaign. The Democratic Party's mission will be to identify for the property-tax payer the connection between actions taken in Trenton and the highest property taxes in the nation."
 
Sharp Increases Predicted
 Many local officials and the State League of Municipalities have predicted sharp increases in property taxes due to the elimination of some special state-aid programs in the Governor's budget. Mr. Lynch said he expects property taxes to rise about 8 percent this year, more than double the increase in the consumer price index, when the figures are released at the end of the year.
But in an interview, Mrs. Whitman said the public no longer accepts the argument that her tax cuts and local property tax hikes are linked "because they're not."
The Governor said the state affects local taxes only when it requires counties and municipalities to undertake new programs without providing the money to carry them out. And she said the Legislature, with her support, will vote to place a "state mandate, state pay" constitutional amendment before the voters in November that would end that practice.
 
Aid Levels to Stay Level
 She also said that in her proposed budget for the fiscal year starting July 1 most municipalities will receive the same level of state aid that they got in the current budget. "It's not how much local governments receive in state aid, but how they spend it," she said.
The Governor said towns are responding in one of three ways to her attempts to trim state government and her call for local governments and school districts to do the same. "Some are asking for help in auditing their operations, some are stabilizing their tax levies by pooling services and some are just complaining that the state government should provide vast amounts of aid," she said.
When Mrs. Whitman promised last September to roll back income tax rates by 30 percent, she gave her campaign for governor a needed boost, but only 20 percent of state residents believed she would follow through, according to opinion polls at the time.
 
'The Promised Land'
 In her inaugural address in January, however, she announced the first installment of her three-year program and quickly pushed the first 5 percent of the tax reduction through the Legislature. Last week she said, "We're halfway to the promised land" after the State Assembly approved cutting income tax rates an additional 10 percent starting in January. The Senate is expected to follow suit later this month.
And as the income tax rate drops, Mrs. Whitman's popularity increases. A recent survey by The Asbury Park Press placed the Governor's approval rating at 78 percent.
Before its passage, Mr. Doria tried to amend the latest tax cut bill to include a provision suspending the cut if the average increase in local property taxes exceeded the rate of inflation. That failed, and Mr. Doria joined 10 other Democrats in voting for Mrs. Whitman's tax cut, which passed 63 to 10.
The Democrats had not expected their proposal to be accepted, but they settled for what they hope will be an issue later.
Brendan Thomas Byrne, the State Democratic chairman, said he will try to focus attention each year in December and June on the state's reports of the average increase in local property taxes. That should remind people that the Democrats had a plan to generate more state aid by suspending the tax cut, he said. "The problem is that when the Governor talks about reducing the income tax, newspapers report it in banner headlines, but there are no front-page headlines about property taxes going up in this town or that," he said.
"I feel frustrated when I hear the Governor blaming the mayors for local property tax increases when she has it within her power to limit what municipalities can spend under our budget caps," Mr. Byrne said. "A member of her cabinet has to approve a town's request to spend more than 2.5 percent over the previous year's budget, and she recently raised the school spending cap that will allow school districts to spend $120 million more in the coming year, money that will have to come from local property taxes."
Mr. Byrne said the public does not realize that two-thirds of the state budget goes back to towns and school districts as state aid, and that when that aid is cut or fails to keep pace with inflation, local taxes must make up for the loss.
Mrs. Whitman said critics of her tax program are missing an important point. "You can't cut your way to a balanced budget," she said. "You must have a strengthening economy and job growth, and since January we've been creating about 6,000 new jobs a month, twice the rate of a year earlier." The Governor said cutting taxes and reducing government bureaucracy has helped convince businesses to move into or expand in New Jersey.
The Democrats and Mrs. Whitman each predicted that the 1995-96 budget will be the toughest to balance because of the continuing need to find economies to pay for the Governor's tax cuts. The Democrats said that by then the connection between lower state income taxes and higher property taxes will become apparent. Mrs. Whitman counters that she expects the state and local governments to have learned to live within their means.

HEADLINE: States Rush To Dispose Of Waste

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SNELLING, S.C.

 BODY:
Each day 20 trucks travel down the isolated blacktop road that leads to the nation's biggest dump for low-level radioactive waste. They are enough to create a traffic jam.
It can take a day or more before one of the tractor trailers loaded with steel boxes and 55-gallon metal drums or the flatbed trucks laden with tall carbon-steel boxes, lead-lined casks built to withstand 80-mile-an-hour crashes, gets its turn to drop off its radioactive cargo. 
 In normal times, only three trucks arrive in a day, but the states that send them are now rushing to beat a June 30 deadline, when the dump that has taken 25 million cubic feet of radioactive machine parts, ash, medical instruments, clothing and manufacturing waste will be closed to shipments from outside eight Southeastern states.
Since 1971, 37 states east of the Rockies have been shipping their dangerous refuse to be buried on the 240 acres of virtually impermeable clay soil here in Barnwell County, S.C., about 45 miles southeast of Augusta, Ga. If the waste were spread five feet deep, it would cover more than 100 football fields.
Once the deadline passes, there will be no permanent place to put the waste. It will have to be kept above ground at thousands of locations, often where it was produced, at utility companies, hospitals, research centers and manufacturers.
The waste at Barnwell County is not intensely radioactive high-level waste, which is mainly spent fuel rods from nuclear power plants and the byproducts of nuclear weapons production and research. This high-level waste remains radioactive for thousands, even hundreds of thousands of years before it decays.
The low-level waste is radioactive as little as 90 days to as long as 200 years. It tends to be a variety of irradiated, rather than intrinsically radioactive, materials. And most of it is not considered lethal even after long exposure but could cause illness or have uncertain long-term effects. About 1 percent of the waste now shipped to Barnwell County has enough radioactivity to kill a human being.
"The stuff is not very dangerous in the first place," said Michael Munger, a political science professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. "But it is the symbolism of a place being viewed as a low-level radioactive waste disposal site that overtakes all logic."
On the other hand, Professor Munger also said, "The probability of things going wrong are small for any one disposal site, but those chances increase tremendously when you have hundreds of storage sites and the ongoing need to move and transport the stuff."
The problem has been obvious for years. In 1980, Congress passed the Low Level Radioactive Waste Act to encourage states to organize themselves into compacts to develop new dumps. Ten compacts were set up, but states in eight of these have simply continued to ship waste to Barnwell County as have three unaffiliated states including New York.
Eighteen months ago, South Carolina, fed up with its reputation as the nation's dumping ground for radioactive wastes, decided to ban dumping to all but the Southeastern states. The state and the county are giving up $50 million a year by restricting access to the dump. Fees for material from outside the region are up to $220 a cubic foot compared with $40 a cubic foot for waste from the region.
The nation's one other dump of this kind is on the Hanford Reservation in Washington, which has been open only to 11 Rocky Mountain and Northwestern states since 1992, when a dump in Beatty, Nev., was closed.
The compacts established under the Federal law spawned studies and debates but only a dozen proposals for sites, none of which have any chance of being approved before 1996.
Local opposition is ubiquitous. No one is anxious to have a radioactive-waste dump next door, and the process is greatly complicated by the lack of a scientific consensus on the safety of various disposal methods.
In three regions, state legislatures have changed the rules for selecting sites, forcing officials to start their approval processes over. In California, which is to have the dump for the Southwestern Compact, the White House at the urging of environmental groups and other opponents has stalled progress by delaying the transfer of federally owned land.
Some people suggest that much of the planning by officials in many states has been faint-hearted at best. Everyone rationalized the lack of progress by noting that Barnwell County would be there as a backstop.
Its closing is sure to force the states to confront their old thinking. Holmes Brown, the executive director of the Low Level Radioactive Waste Forum, an organization of disposal planners, said the closing would accelerate planning for new dumps.
"No one wants to predict a date certain on any site," Mr. Brown said. "But everyone has been on notice that this day was coming. Legislatures have gotten serious about this."
But Mr. Munger, who has studied the planning process over the years, said most states were still not serious about being home to a nuclear-waste dump. He pointed out that more than $300 million had already been spent in the nation on planning, an amount that measures how far some states have gone to avoid having a disposal site.
"The closing of Barnwell will increase the pressure on other regions," Mr. Munger said, "but ultimately the compact system of regional disposal will fail because so many states are just going through the motions. Whether it wants to or not, the Congress and the Federal Government will have to re-enter the picture."
Caught in the middle are the utilities and other businesses and organizations that use radioactive material and create the waste.
Allan D. Pasternak, technical director of the California Radioactive Materials Management Forum, said the closing of the Barnwell dump amounted to the loss of the only safe port in uncertain and stormy seas.
"It's a double-edged sword because, if Barnwell stayed open, we would continue to have a disposal resource but it probably would have slowed down planning in other parts of the country," Mr. Pasternak said. "But, we all keep wondering how this closing now is going to create a sense of urgency about something that has been going on since 1980."
One piece of good news is an outgrowth of the escalating cost of dumping at Barnwell in recent years. The organizations that make the waste have been working to reduce the volume by limiting operations, incinerating wastes into ash or compacting it.
Their success has led some to question whether all of the disposal sites now being planned are necessary or economically viable.

HEADLINE: Some Doctors Face Computer Age Warily

SERIES: Going on Line: A periodic look at a community hospital's place in the computer age.

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PATERSON, N.J.

 BODY:
The computer age may have arrived at St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center, but the bits and bytes have not changed a basic truth of hospital life: there are doctors, and there is everybody else.
Hospital administrators, in putting a new computerized hospital-records network on line here in April, decided early not to require physicians to type their orders into the computers. It would doom the effort, they said. That has put clerical workers like Alisa McClendon, a unit receptionist in the first-floor geriatric ward, in the vanguard of the hospital's march toward automation. An alternative point of view is that clerks and nurses have simply been saddled with the work. 
 "They, I think, will never change, no matter how much you give them," Ms. McClendon said, referring to the doctors who troop by her post every day, trying to extract information from the computer. "It seems like one little step they might not be familiar with, so instead of them just trying it on their own, they'll try to find the unit receptionist or the unit manager," she said. " 'Do you think it's possible to get this for me? Is there any chance you're not busy?' "
Old and new coexist everywhere in the special geriatrics unit known as Regan One West. The new computers are plunked down on tables in the crowded nursing station next to an ancient-looking Executone patient intercom. Nurses, aides and doctors whirl in and out through the corridors, checking computer screens one minute, dog-eared paper charts the next.
It is a hospital of time-honored traditions. Founded after the Civil War by the Roman Catholic Sisters of Charity to treat the immigrant poor, St. Joseph's has grown into one of the largest teaching hospitals in the region, with 792 beds and advanced treatment in areas like neonatal care and dialysis. Nurses, doctors and administrators say the old guard of physicians is still strong. Many do not deign to type.
And because administrators made the conscious decision not to force the issue, the anxieties that some doctors might have in dealing with computers have simply been avoided as an issue: no one has asked or required them to learn even the elementary step of signing on, not to mention requiring them to type in their own orders for hospital procedures, called physician order entries.
"I don't think it will ever come to a point where using the computer will be mandatory, because there will always be some physicians who do not want to do it," said Maureen Romoser, the administrative director for nursing services. "Maybe I should clarify that," she added. "Maybe in 50 years."
 
'It Takes Time to Learn'
 Other people said that the hospital, having leaped into the information age with a $25 million network that went completely on line in a single weekend this spring, should not expect miracles.
"To have 'physician order entry,' you have to have the physician staff capable of using the computer, and I'm not sure everyone is capable," said Dr. Gary Kosc, a gastroenterologist from West Paterson, who was checking on one of his geriatric patients on a recent afternoon. "It takes time to learn," he said, and time to embrace it as a useful tool.
Every hospital's culture is different. So too are the paths they take in adopting the tools of cost control, managed care and automated records systems, a transformation being forced on hospitals everywhere by insurance companies, big health care buyers like health maintenance organizations, and the prospect of a Federal health care overhaul from Washington.
At St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan, for example, the hospital is installing a new internal records network similar to St. Joseph's, but will leap directly to doctors' typing in their own orders in late 1995. At other hospitals, like New York University -- perhaps the most automated hospital in the region -- computer literacy for physicians has been a requirement for years.
Hospital experts say that places like St. Joseph's -- in an area with many hospitals -- have less leverage in compelling doctors, who can take their business elsewhere if they are unhappy. And the less a physician is tied to any one hospital, the less incentive to learn its computer system.
 
Challenging the Old Ways
 But there is no question, they add, that hospital records systems are threats to old bases of power.
"It challenges the old ways of doing things," said Dr. Patricia Flatley Brennan, an associate professor of nursing and systems engineering at Case Western Reserve University. "Once you change the way information flows, you change the way people work together -- you change who is in power and who has the right to make decisions."
But even here, some doctors are urging that they be required to participate fully.
Dr. John J. Farkas, a wiry, bearded gastroenterology and hepatology specialist, said he sees himself as a catalyst of sorts, prodding the administration to move faster on the road it has set for itself. While he understands the hospital's reluctance to compound confusion by forcing old ways to change too fast, he maintains that delaying a cultural adaptation by physicians will not make it easier. "Without physician order entry, the system is a big miss," he said.
But there is also fear, in various varieties.
The new network, essentially a nerve system for the hospital, now only allows coordination of medical supplies, lab results, admissions, transfers and dozens of other basic functions. Add-on components scheduled for introduction in coming months, however, will create a whole new push into matters of medical judgment, a function called "decision support."
Before the network came on line, orders for things like blood tests or radiology were handwritten and dispatched by messengers who roamed the hospital corridors; individual departments and labs had computers, but they were never coordinated. Under the new regime, the connections -- from the administrative offices to the warehouse -- are like nerves extending through every limb.
The computer will be able to assist doctors in diagnoses. It will schedule operating rooms by calculating how fast or slow a surgeon has performed a particular procedure in the past. It will allow administrators to know much more than they do now about who exactly does what.
Doing that also requires the assigning of numerical values to things that have always been done on human need and intuition. One software program scheduled to come on line early next year, for example, will calculate how many hours a day of hands-on nursing time should be required for a particular patient with a particular health problem.
For some, the computer symbolizes bureaucracy and intrusion.
"It's getting worse and worse," said Tammy Gundlah, a 28-year-old registered nurse, sitting in her office, a converted coat closet she shares with another nurse in geriatrics. "Everything is so legal, you need all this documentation all the time. It's disappointing, you're always afraid somebody's going to sue for this, you've got to make sure you write everything down, everything's got to be charted. And this computer thing; it's like you're more out at the desk dealing with the computers than with the patients."
In this unit, in particular, where the patients are older, sicker and likely to stay longer, health care providers worry that all the data will ultimately make it harder for the hospital to subsidize long-term and indigent patients.
As the computer system is able to collect very precise statistics on every cost, many doctors and nurses worry that administrators, armed with vast new amounts of information and under pressure to economize, could find it harder to justify providing treatment without regard to cost.
How, exactly, do you measure the treatment received by Stella Zober? Mrs. Zober, a wispy-haired 79-year-old Wallington resident, was admitted in late May, barely able to move after her arthritis suddenly worsened. Through therapy in the geriatrics unit, she has regained the ability to get about with a walker, but she is not ready to go back to her apartment, or to a nursing home. And no one is pushing to have her discharged.
"I think, always, that the quality of care, the quality of life, will prevail," said Dr. Belinda Vicioso, the chief of geriatric medicine. Then she paused for moment. "I'm hoping."
Dr. Vicioso also believes that physicians at the keyboard will ultimately be common at St. Joseph's, though she concedes it will not be painless.
"The old guard is dying off," she said. "It will happen; it has to happen. If we can cut down on the number of steps, the delivery of care will be more efficient, and cheaper, hopefully."
Hope is plentiful. Nurses who deplored the changes they see and fear, like Mrs. Gundlah, also said just as often that they couldn't envision working anywhere else. Some who seem to have inherited the burden of the work in the new electronic order have also observed that information is power, even if you have to work harder.
"Like they say, one hand washes the other. You be nice to me, I'll be nice to you; treat me with respect, I'll treat you with respect," said Ms. McClendon, the unit receptionist. Even the doctors figure that out eventually, she added, smiling, "So it's not that bad."
 
 
 
THE SERIES SO FAR
 The first article in this series about the introduction of a computer system at St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center in Paterson, N.J., appeared on April 8. It described the hospital's preparations to computerize virtually all of its operations in a single weekend, and the fears and hopes of employees. The second article, which appeared on April 11, told of the big and small problems employees had encountered in the abrupt start-up of the system, and the solutions that were worked out.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Building New Roads for El Diario

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON 

 BODY:
Back when Peter W. Davidson was a young president of a newspaper company -- or, more precisely, when he was a younger one, since he is only 35 now -- he thought newspaper publishing was a relatively simple and lucrative business.
But listen to him now. 
 "I realize the newspaper business isn't as attractive as I, or any of us, thought," he said in his lower Manhattan office at El Diario-La Prensa, the 81-year-old Spanish-language daily in New York that he and a group of investors bought from the Gannett Company in 1989.
Call it the education of a yuppie in the real world of business. At the time of the purchase, Mr. Davidson, educated at Stanford and the Harvard Business School and the grandson of Jacob Merrill Kaplan, the philanthropist, was working as an investment banker at Morgan Stanley & Company under the media specialist Steven Rattner.
"Peter," Mr. Rattner said the other day, "is a classic yuppie in the positive sense: young, hungry, bright, well educated, thoughtful."
Five tough years later, after surviving sharp circulation declines and a stubborn recession that stalled advertising, the newspaper is recovering. And Mr. Davidson has clearly learned some lessons.
 
A New Patience
 One of them is shown in his manner. "He was less patient then; he is more patient now," said Carlos D. Ramirez, who has been publisher of El Diario both for Gannett and for Mr. Davidson. Mr. Ramirez is also part of Mr. Davidson's investor group.
Evidence of another lesson is in his strategic approach to the business, which has revenues of about $17 million, up from about $12 million five years ago. Mr. Davidson is now busily expanding into other businesses, many of which have little to do with traditional newspapering.
El Diario, with a circulation of 51,000, remains the center of the business. The tabloid newspaper makes extensive use of color printing in covering local, national and international news for Hispanic readers. Recently, Mr. Davidson said he was reaffirming a commitment to local news when he appointed two new co-editors: Juan Garcia, who had been managing editor, and Aileen Gelpi, who had been metropolitan editor. Ms. Gelpi is the first Puerto Rican-born woman to edit a major daily in New York. They replaced Fernando Moreno, who moved to other editing responsibilities.
Like many newspaper executives, Mr. Davidson has grown convinced that revenue growth at newspapers is likely to be much more limited than he used to think.
He has El Diario people working on Hispanic television programming. He is publishing a grocery-store promotional guide with coupons for Hispanic consumers. And he is particularly excited about a new El Diario-sponsored marketing and advertising agency that is helping big companies like Citibank get their message to a Hispanic audience.
Mr. Davidson also said his company was interested in possible acquisitions of magazines and broadcast outlets that are oriented toward Hispanic audiences. The company is also talking with potential new investors to increase its capital, he said.
 
 
A $20 Million Start
 At the beginning, non-newspaper ventures were not the goal. Fascinated by newspapers in high school and college, Mr. Davidson worked one summer while in business school for Donald E. Graham, the publisher of The Washington Post. "I liked the entire package of his life style," Mr. Davidson said.
So in 1989, Mr. Davidson did what many bright young investment bankers in the 1980's only talked about. He assembled investors to back his bid for a business. They won El Diario for slightly more than $20 million, it was reported at the time.
Part of the premise of the high-debt deal, Mr. Davidson acknowledges, is that the newspaper industry would remain robust, with revenues climbing each year.
"I think he came into this thinking it would continue like that forever," Mr. Ramirez said.
The first year was good. Mr. Davidson studied Spanish, learned about the Hispanic community in New York, and got to work on the paper. Revenue grew as expected.
And then, the lessons of the real world started.
Like a good investment banker, Mr. Davidson researched the possible decline in circulation if he raised El Diario's newsstand price, then 35 cents. He even got advice from his old marketing professor at Harvard.
The experts told him to expect a decline of 3 to 5 percent in circulation, which was then about 60,000.
Trying to build revenues, El Diario raised its price to 45 cents. The circulation plunged by 20,000, to 40,000, or more than 30 percent, Mr. Ramirez said. It has since climbed slowly.
With the economy in a slump in 1991, and with circulation, advertising and revenues down, El Diario was forced to lay off management employees and demand concessions from a union of editorial employees. The newspaper renegotiated loans and has been able to make payments, but it has not yet shown a net profit.
There were other lessons, too. A promoter persuaded Mr. Davidson to back a series of concerts of Mexican bands because of what sounded like the synergies possible through newspaper promotion. "We got killed," and withdrew from the deal after two concerts, Mr. Davidson said.
And then, there was every entrepreneur's vision of national expansion. Mr. Davidson formed a separate company and, with a partner, acquired Hispanic weekly newspapers in Chicago and San Francisco. On paper, Mr. Davidson said, the logic seemed clear: national advertisers would be drawn by a national network delivering Hispanic readers.
Only, he discovered, national advertisers were not really interested in the quality of printing available on newsprint. And, he said, it was frustrating to try to run publications so far from the home office. "Whenever the phone rang, it was a problem," he said.
Mr. Davidson gave up his stake in the weeklies about a year ago. "We don't want to be getting involved in far-flung operations, no matter how sexy it seems," he said.
 
Supplementing the Daily
 For now, Mr. Davidson is sticking to more manageable projects. Five months ago, he started El Diario Extra!, a free publication distributed in Hispanic neighborhoods in the metropolitan area. It has a circulation of 235,000. He said it was already moderately profitable, supplying advertisers with a way to reach Hispanic consumers who do not read El Diario.
He is imitating the efforts of many larger English-language newspaper companies that have tried to build revenues by adding editorial products to supplement their main dailies. El Diario imitates Parade magazine, for example, with a thin monthly magazine on special topics like soccer and business. It is distributed with seven Hispanic publications around the country.
And Mr. Davidson is especially enthusiastic about Paloma Promotions and Advertising, the agency he started as a way to take advantage of El Diario's status as an expert on the Hispanic community.
The creation of Paloma reflects Mr. Davidson's changing view of El Diario's franchise. It is not just a newspaper, he said, but a marketing "guide and a shepherd" for corporate clients who want to reach Hispanic readers. But he did not make any pretense that this was a carefully charted course.
Mr. Davidson described the product development plan he now uses at El Diario: "We rush out with a bunch of things, without -- I hate to say this -- without really studying it, and see what works."
It was as if he was trying to show how far he had come since the orderly days of the Harvard Business School and Morgan Stanley.

Spirited, Wide-Ranging Tribute To Modern Choreographers

BYLINE: By JACK ANDERSON 

DATELINE: DURHAM, N.C., June 19

 BODY:
The American Dance Festival accomplished an extraordinary number of things in one single evening. The program on Saturday night at Page Auditorium of Duke University here emphasized the richness of American modern dance and called attention to the accomplishments of black choreographers.
The event featured two talented and versatile groups, one from Ohio, the other from Colorado. The Dayton Contemporary Dance Company dates from 1960. The Denver-based Cleo Parker Robinson Dance Ensemble was established in 1970. Their productions included two major revivals, a world premiere and pieces by three other choreographers. 
 The result was a historical and cultural survey that educated as well as entertained. Yet no pedantry was involved.
There was certainly nothing stuffily academic about the Denver company's revival of "Choros," which Katherine Dunham created in 1941. Miss Dunham, who turns 85 on Wednesday and was a guest at the festival, is one of the pioneers of black American choreography. In addition to studying dance, she studied anthropology at the University of Chicago, and her style combines elements of many folk forms with the theatricality of a Broadway revue.
Dance lovers had an opportunity to meet Miss Dunham in a special program on Friday night, during which she answered questions from the audience. Although she has used a wheelchair since knee surgery a few years ago, she promised, "I'll surprise everyone someday and go tripping down the road." She proceeded to recall economic and racial adversities in the Depression and urged everyone to study anthropology.
Her "Choros," based on a traditional Brazilian quadrille, abounds with deft little kicking steps. On Saturday, Karah Abiog, Gary Lewis, Angelica Edwards and Randy Brooks made all its bounces and leaps seem like chuckles.
The other revival, staged by the Dayton group, was "The Beloved," Lester Horton's grim 1948 dance drama. From the mid-1930's to his death in 1953, Horton, the only white choreographer represented on the program, directed a Los Angeles company that is believed to be America's first racially integrated modern-dance troupe. He was also a distinguished teacher, and one of his later pupils was Alvin Ailey.
"The Beloved," to a score by Judith Hamilton played on the piano by Kevin Ward, concerns a religious bigot who accuses his wife of infidelity and then murders her. The choreographic tone was established at the outset when the curtain rose upon Dawn Wood and Calvin Norris Young looking as rigid as the chairs in which they sat.
Mr. Young was a formidable presence, and when he was consumed with suspicion, he tugged at Miss Wood with brute force. One of the effective touches to her characterization was the way she let the wife give no hint of whether the accusations are true. For this woman, ambiguity was her one defense against her husband's overwhelming power.
Talley Beatty's "Ellingtonia," the evening's premiere, is a bright addition to the Denver company's repertory. Mr. Beatty, who is in his 70's and was also at the festival, danced with Miss Dunham in Chicago in the 1930's and has been creating his own works since the 40's. He is especially known for his patterns for groups. His new suite to four recorded compositions by Duke Ellington is both intricate and exhilarating.
Its opening sequence features running, jumping and whirling with many sudden changes of direction. Then a long line of twisting dancers breaks apart into small groups of swaggering, swiveling and sauntering people. A brief duet, in which Mr. Brooks and Marceline Freeman repeatedly run toward each other and separate, is followed by an energetic finale in which all 11 cast members leap on and off from all parts of the stage.
The Denver dancers also presented "Sombra y Sol," a fantasy to music by Aaron Copland, which Donald McKayle choreographed in 1991 as a tribute to the Mexican painter Frida Kahlo. Ms. Freeman, who portrayed the artist, encountered dancers costumed as monkeys and birds, and was haunted by a skeletal figure representing death. But the choreography was more effective as an evocation of atmosphere than as a symbolic drama.
The other productions came from the Dayton company. If the dancers were especially high-spirited this summer, that may have been because the director, Jeraldyne Blunden, has just received a grant from the MacArthur Foundation of Chicago of $320,000 over the next five years.
In 1991, Dwight Rhoden honored this crusader for modern dance with "Beyond a Cliff: A Tribute to Jeraldyne Blunden," to music by Michael Shrieve, Olfra Haza and Martin Birkenstock. His choreographic ode to indomitability was an appropriate addition to the program, and the way its leading dancer, Sheri Williams, conquered space symbolized a defiance of obstacles.
The Dayton dancers displayed their dramatic gifts in "Las Desenamoradas," the dance to music by John Coltrane that Eleo Pomare adapted from "The House of Bernarda Alba," Federico Garcia Lorca's play about a possessive mother. Ms. Wood, cast as this matriarch, moved implacably and convincingly and tyrannized her household.

HEADLINE: For a Festival, Rain or Shine?

BYLINE: By ALLAN KOZINN 

 BODY:
This week at Waterloo, a restored colonial village near Stanhope, N.J., student musicians are getting their bearings, and groundskeepers are getting the 2,000-seat concert tent and the surrounding picnic area ready for the opening of the 19th Waterloo Festival on Saturday evening, when Catherine Comet will conduct a program of Russian music with Andre Watts as the soloist in the Rachmaninoff Second Piano Concerto.
But if the preparations seem to be business as usual for the hybrid music school and concert series, they come after an unusually tumultuous year. Administrative and artistic shakeups at the festival have yielded a shift toward more conservative programming. And in a way, the festival has been eclipsed by plans for the future of Waterloo itself. 
 Last October, Percival H. E. Leach, the president and founder of Waterloo, announced that he hoped to build a $50 million arts center in the village, and that he had been discussing summer seasons with the Metropolitan Opera, the New York Philharmonic and American Ballet Theater. The center would open in 1996.
At the time, Gov. Jim Florio said he supported a $21 million bond issue. But that was only weeks before Mr. Florio was defeated by Christine Todd Whitman, who had portrayed Mr. Florio's administration as profligate during her campaign. But if the state's $21 million can no longer be taken for granted, the project does have an ally in Gualberto Medina, the new Commissioner of Commerce and Economic Development. Mr. Medina said that $5.5 million had been set aside from the Economic Recovery Fund, and that he was completing a study that he would present to Governor Whitman at the end of the month.
"All this is predicated on my feeling comfortable with the project from a financial standpoint," Mr. Medina said. "What we're doing in New Jersey is submitting any project that is proposed to a rigorous analysis. We have to look at the revenue we can expect the center to bring in, and we have to feel confident that it will repay the bond issue. Frankly, I feel that this project is doable, but I have to withold judgment until I have the figures in place."
 
Need for Persuasion
 The rest of the money for the Waterloo Center for the Performing Arts must be raised privately, and Mr. Leach said last week that he had commitments for virtually all of the remaining $30 million. That leaves, however, the chicken-and-egg business of persuading the Met, the Philharmonic and Ballet Theater to commit themselves fully.
After the October announcement, the Met backtracked slightly, pointing out that it gave annual performances at Waterloo already, and that it had not committed to extending its visits. A difference, though, is that the theatrical facilities of the new center would allow for fully staged opera instead of the concert presentations the Met currently offers during the summer. The Philharmonic, too, has been cautious. Deborah Borda, its executive director, is saying only that Waterloo "is one of several options we're considering."
For Mr. Medina, the participation of the New York companies is crucial. "The Met really is the major concern," he said. "If we can bring them, I think it will work, and if we can bring the Philharmonic and Ballet Theater, then we'll have an extremely attractive program to offer. We realize, though, that before we can sit down with those companies, we have to put together the financing so that we can give them firm dates for construction."
 
Conductor Resigns
 The festival, meanwhile, has weathered its own upheavals. Gerard Schwarz, who founded the festival in 1976, when he was a well-known trumpet soloist and a fledgling conductor, resigned as music director early this year, saying that his responsibilities as director of the Mostly Mozart Festival, the Seattle Symphony Orchestra and the New York Chamber Symphony were keeping him too busy for Waterloo. He has been replaced by Yoav Talmi, a 50-year-old Israeli conductor who directs the San Diego Symphony and conducted at Waterloo several times over the last five years.
"I was able to plan the festival's program and invite the other conductors and soloists," said Mr. Talmi, speaking by telephone from Wellington, New Zealand, where he is conducting. "But it is difficult, with only two or three months' notice, to reach musicians who are free. I think within the time we had, we have done miraculously well."
Besides Miss Comet and Mr. Watts, Mr. Talmi's roster for the festival's four concerts includes the conductor Joseph Silverstein, the soprano Helen Donath, the violinist Elmar Oliveira and the cellist Carter Brey. Mr. Talmi will conduct the last two concerts, on July 9 and 16. There is also a series of Friday evening chamber concerts (beginning this week) at Drew University, in Madison, N.J. And there are free rehearsals on Thursday evenings at the Seasons Resort and Conference Center in McAfee, N.J., where the school's master classes are held.
 
Director Dismissed
 In the other major administrative change, Samuel Lipman, the pianist and critic who, as artistic director since 1985, has guided the school and emphasized American music in the festival's programs, has been dismissed. The festival's literature now lists Carol Delaire as the director of the school, which has 90 students between the ages of 18 and 25 and a faculty that includes members of the New York Philharmonic, the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, the New York Chamber Symphony, the Seattle Symphony and other ensembles. Most of last year's faculty, Ms. Delaire said, is returning this year.
Mr. Leach's principal complaint about Mr. Lipman was that his programming, though admired by critics, was driving listeners away. Mr. Talmi, when asked whether he had been told to restrain his programming, said: "The only guideline was that the directors of the festival asked me to keep the programs very popular, since they are trying to attract more people. So keeping that in mind, I tried not to get too adventurous."
It may be, though, that programming alone has not been responsible for Waterloo's falling attendance in recent years. Pushed to present more mainstream fare, Mr. Lipman last year presented the popular violinist Pinchas Zukerman in the Beethoven Violin Concerto, and sold what Mr. Leach described as "fewer than 500" tickets.
"Our audiences have not been what they should be," Mr. Leach said. "Last year, on average, I would say we were half full. And the year before, when we had 12 weeks of rain, there was a tremendous impact on ticket sales. I do worry about this. It is increasingly difficult to sell good music."
Mr. Leach argues that his proposed arts center, which is to have 4,000 enclosed seats and 5,000 lawn seats, will deal with that problem more easily, since the high-profile ensembles he hopes to have in residence are likely to be a greater draw than Waterloo's combined student and faculty orchestra. (Waterloo also presents rock concerts during the summer, which Mr. Leach said do much better financially.) He added that plans to build a hotel and conference center nearby may make Waterloo a more attractive place to spend a weekend.
"People wend their way to Tanglewood," Mr. Leach said, "which is farther from New York than Waterloo is. We are only an hour out of town, and we have our own exit on a major artery, Interstate 80. We have a beautiful, entirely historical village in which a period from the Revolution to the Industrial Revolution is preserved. We're in a lovely area, surrounded by 11,000 acres of the Allamuchy Mountain State Park. There's no reason we can't become the Tanglewood of this area."

HEADLINE: Universal Coverage at Risk

 BODY:
The debate over health care reform has stalled over the issue of employer mandates -- the requirement, as proposed by President Clinton, that employers pay most of the cost of policies chosen by their employees. At stake is a primary purpose of health care reform -- universal coverage
The President is insisting on the mandate because he believes it is the only realistic way of moving to universal coverage. Small employers are fighting back hard because many fear a mandate will drive them out of business. And conservatives are fighting the mandate because, to them, it is the opening through which the Government will creep into every corner of health care. 
 Here, Mr. Clinton has it right. Universal coverage is not only a fair and noble objective, consistent with America's values; it is also essential if health care markets are to work well.
There are several variations of health care reform floating around Capitol Hill. Most of them would protect the chronically ill by requiring insurers to sell to any applicant at non-discriminatory rates. But once that guarantee is included, healthy people would be tempted to forgo insurance until they got sick; that would leave only the sick to buy coverage, at rates the insurers would be forced to set very high. The President would overcome the problem by requiring everyone to buy coverage. And because the vast majority of Americans already get coverage through employers, he proposes an employer mandate because it could achieve universal coverage without institutional upheaval.
That said, Mr. Clinton seems to be flexible about how to impose a mandate. It could be delayed or phased in slowly to give employers time to adjust. The President could also embrace a "hard trigger" whereby Congress would suspend the mandate for, say, five years; then if insurance reforms alone had not achieved universal coverage, a mandate would automatically kick in. But what the President ought not do is drop the mandate or accept a wishy-washy promise that someday, somehow it will be adopted if needed.
Small employers despise the mandate because, with profits already slim, they fear new costs will force them to lay off workers. But careful studies show the fear is exaggerated. For example, employers have offset state and Federal mandates requiring them to cover childbirth expenses by cutting back on wage increases for women of childbearing age and their husbands. The beneficiaries absorbed the cost of the mandate, employers were barely nicked and virtually no one had to be laid off.
Though the mandate is the best route to universal coverage, it need not be imposed immediately. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that insurance reform without mandates can achieve near-universal coverage. Reform would forbid insurers from discriminating against the chronically ill, "pool" small employers and individuals into large purchasing cooperatives, and provide subsidies to poor families.
Taken together, these reforms would lift the percentage of the population with insurance from 85 percent to over 91 percent. And since most of those who would refuse to buy coverage under such rules would be disproportionately young and healthy, insurance would cover perhaps 97 percent of the nation's total health care expenditures. At that point Congress could let a mandate automatically kick in to pick up the uninsured, or devise some other solution.
Small-business lobbyists and conservatives have done an excellent job of portraying an employer mandate as a huge economic risk. Now the President and his supporters must do an equally good job convincing a confused public that the mandate is the least-disruptive way to bring to every American family financial security from medical catastrophe.

HEADLINE: Towers Investors Try Aggressive New Legal Tack

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES

 BODY:
Thanks to a precedent-smashing Supreme Court decision in April, the heat has been turned up in the fiery courthouse battle being waged by aggrieved investors in the Towers Financial Corporation of New York, a bankrupt conglomerate that Federal prosecutors have charged was the vehicle by which the financier Steven Hoffenberg defrauded investors of more than $450 million between 1988 and 1993.
 A sharply divided court reversed decades of practice by barring investors from filing "aiding and abetting" accusations against accountants, lawyers and other financial professionals whose clients had committed securities fraud. 
In response to the decision, lawyers for the investors have substantially raised the ante; they are now contending that the lawyers, accountants, brokers and credit analysts who worked for Towers when the disputed securities were sold were direct participants in the fraud -- and therefore bear direct responsibility for the investors' losses.
 
'Lame Explanations'
 The plaintiffs contend that Towers' lawyers -- the firm of Squadron, Ellenoff, Plesent & Lehrer in New York -- permitted perjured testimony by company executives, accepted as fact the company's "lame explanations" and outright lies to market regulators, and ignored early warning signs in correspondence from brokers and from outside auditors.
 The plaintiffs also contend that accountants at Richard A. Eisner & Company who audited Towers' investment subsidiaries, ignored evidence of fraudulent behavior by the parent company; and that the credit agency that reviewed the firm's bonds, the Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Company, knew or should have known that its prestige was being used as a selling point for the firm's notes, which were not rated.
 In each case, the plaintiffs argue, the alleged fraud by Towers could not have continued but for the participation of the professionals, whose reputation and standing lent credibility to the Towers operation.
 That argument is the core of a revised 175-page complaint filed last week in Federal District Court in Manhattan by lawyers representing investors. Those lawyers' firms include Milberg, Weiss, Bershad, Hynes & Lerach in New York and Lieff, Cabraser & Heimann in San Francisco. The amended complaint has provoked outrage among the defendants who provided professional services, several of whom are asking the court to dismiss the case and impose punitive sanctions on the lawyers who filed it.
 "The complaint is completely without merit," said Robert Jossen, the attorney for the Eisner firm. "Our client did the job they were supposed to do in their audit of the subsidiaries, and there is no basis to charge Eisner with any wrongdoing."
 Philip Kaufman, the attorney for the Squadron law firm, noted that his client had not been named in any of "at least a dozen separate class action complaints across the country" until the current complaint. Ira Sorkin, the principal lawyer who handled the Towers work, said the accusations were "totally baseless and would be proven to be so."
 The role of Duff & Phelps was limited to providing a credit rating for bonds sold by Towers, and not for the notes purchased by the plaintiffs in the current case, said Joseph Coughlin, the firm's lawyer in Chicago. "If the noteholders are told by the sellers that the notes are not rated, I don't see how you can say that we are lending our expertise to anything," he added.
 
A Reversal by Founder
 Lawyers for the professional firms named in the complaint argued that the harsh accusations were merely an effort by the plaintiffs to sidestep the limits imposed by the Supreme Court. But a plaintiffs' attorney familiar with the preparation of the complaint disagreed, saying that he and his colleagues "had always felt that these guys were primary wrongdoers." There was simply no reason to word the complaint in those terms until the Supreme Court decision, he said.
 There was no shortage of legal fireworks in the Towers Financial case even before the Supreme Court voted in April to restrict the rights of investors to sue in cases like the Towers operation, which securities regulators have described as one of the largest Ponzi schemes in history.
 Mr. Hoffenberg, who was the founder and chairman of Towers, is facing criminal charges of fraud and obstruction of justice in connection with his ownership and operation of the insolvent company, which is being dismantled under the protection of the Federal Bankruptcy Court. In addition, both Mr. Hoffenberg and Towers have been sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, on civil charges of violating securities laws in the sale of the notes and bonds.
 In a bizarre twist, Mr. Hoffenberg has pleaded not guilty to the charges, but has also asked the Federal District Court to force prosecutors to reinstate a revoked plea agreement under which he agreed to confess to at least five criminal counts in exchange for leniency in sentencing. The plea bargain was nullified by the Government on the grounds that Mr. Hoffenberg had violated its terms by lying about ongoing violations of a court-ordered freeze of his assets.
 Lawyers for the S.E.C. are still preparing for trial in their case, said Richard Walker, regional securities administrator for the commission.
 Mr. Walker said he did not anticipate that the Supreme Court decision would affect that effort because that case does not contend "aiding and abetting" but rather direct violations of securities laws.
 "The private complaints have been more expansive in naming wrongdoers than we have," Mr. Walker said. "But we intend to be very aggressive in bringing cases, to test the parameters of the ruling."

CORRECTION-DATE: July 11, 1994, Monday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on June 20 about the legal battle between the Towers Financial Corporation and its investors used an outdated name for one of the law firms involved. The firm that represented Towers is Squadron, Ellenoff, Plesent, Sheinfeld & Sorkin; it ceased to be known as Squadron, Ellenoff, Plesent & Lehrer about two years ago.

HEADLINE: U.S. and Russia to Back Bosnia Pact Jointly

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ZAGREB, Croatia, June 20

 BODY:
The United States, Russia and the European Union aim to endorse a final territorial settlement for Bosnia at a three-day meeting of leaders of seven major industrial nations that begins July 8 in Naples, a senior United Nations official said today.
The settlement would assign 51 percent of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the federation of the Muslim-dominated Bosnian Government and the Bosnian Croats, and the rest to the Bosnian Serbs. 
 The boundaries are to be approved at a meeting of foreign ministers from the United States, Russia, Britain, France and Germany that has been provisionally set for July 1 and 2 in Geneva, Western diplomats said.
The plan is to be endorsed by President Clinton and the other six leaders -- from Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan -- who make up the so-called Group of Seven; they are to be joined later by President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia.
The idea is to lend new weight to the long-muddled effort to end the 27-month-old war.
 
And if One Refuses . . .
 The proposal would then be submitted to the warring parties, take it or leave it, accompanied by a mixture of blandishments and potential punishments intended to insure acceptance.
"If the Muslims agree to the settlement and the Serbs don't, then the arms embargo on Bosnia could be lifted," said the United Nations official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "If the Serbs agree and the Muslims don't, the idea is that trade sanctions on Serbia could be progressively lifted."
But after talks this weekend with Charles E. Redman, Washington's special envoy for the Balkans, the United Nations official said he was pessimistic that even a plan explicitly backed by Mr. Clinton and Mr. Yeltsin would end the war.
"We are into a crucial few weeks that will decide if peace prevails or a wider conflict erupts, but the signs are not encouraging," the official said. "Low-level fighting continues despite a cease-fire signed by the warring parties, and there are indications of preparations for new offensives."
Mr. Redman and the Russian, British and French diplomats in the "contact group" working on the proposed settlement are thus racing the clock.
 
Both Sides Seem Dug In
 Indeed, Mr. Redman has already asked Yasushi Akashi, the top United Nations official in the region, to try to negotiate an extension of the tenuous month-long Bosnian cease-fire, which went into effect on June 10. Relative calm on the battlefield is widely regarded as essential to any political settlement.
The Bosnian Serbs, who hold about three-quarters of Bosnia, have said they might settle for half, but only if what they give up is mostly economically unattractive mountainous stretches, not towns. The Serbs say they will not give up Prijedor, Banja Luka, Brcko, Zvornik, Vlasenica or Visegrad, which they seized by force during the war, killing or evicting most of the non-Serbian residents.
But the Government says it will not give up the fight until those who were forced out can return to their homes.
For several weeks, members of the contact group considered establishing United Nations administrations in disputed towns. But this idea has been abandoned, a United States diplomat said, because "it just puts off the problem."
 
High Hurdles Remain
 Instead, the idea is to draw the border between the Muslim-Croatian federation and the Serbs so it runs through several of these towns. "Think of it as a series of little Nicosias," said one official, referring to the divided capital of Cyprus.
Several difficulties remain. The first is that the Serbs appear unprepared -- even under Russian pressure -- to give up control of what they regard as strategically vital towns.
The second is that the current Government offensive toward Vlasenica, undertaken despite the June 10 truce, suggests that the Government is still a long way from believing that diplomacy can secure its territorial demands.
The third is the danger that the unity between Washington and Moscow could fray if one of the warring parties rejects the proposal.
 
Carrots and Sticks
 If the Muslims balk, a lifting of trade sanctions on the Serbs would be a very hard decision for the Clinton Administration to make. The United States Government and Congress generally view the Muslims as the aggrieved party.
But if the Serbs, traditional allies of the Russians, say no, President Yeltsin would have great political difficulty in accepting a end to the arms embargo on the Bosnian Government, a decision his Foreign Minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev, recently described as a recipe for a third world war.
"Unity between Russia and the United States is essential if we are to bring real pressure to bear on the parties," the United Nations official said. "But I fear their cooperation may be severely tested."

HEADLINE: Clinton Is Hopeful Yet Cautious About Carter's North Korea Trip

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 20

 BODY:
President Clinton said today that he welcomed "hopeful signs" that a clash over North Korea's nuclear weapons program could be averted. But he maintained an air of skepticism about the pledges former President Jimmy Carter won from the North.
Mr. Clinton's comments were his first on the matter since Mr. Carter returned from his visit to the Korean peninsula, and they reflected an insistence by the Administration that the Communist Government do more to demonstrate its willingness to halt its nuclear program. 
"The critical question is: are they willing to freeze this nuclear program?" Mr. Clinton said in an interview on the NBC News program "Today." He said the United States needed "to know what the facts are" before agreeing to the new round of high-level talks North Korea is seeking.
 
Sanctions Still Possible
 With the White House facing criticism from Republicans and even some Democrats for failing to hew to a hard line, the Administration sought to demonstrate today that it has not ruled out seeking economic sanctions against North Korea. American and Russian officials discussed those tougher measures in a meeting at the United Nations, and the subject is to be the primary focus of a meeting on Wednesday in Brussels between Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev of Russia.
But in the interview, Mr. Clinton also backed further away from the Administration's one-time insistence that the North insure that international monitors are allowed to determine how much plutonium North Korea might have diverted from its reactor at Yongbyon in the past.
"I think what we have to do is to look to the present and the future, and say we will evaluate words in terms of actions," Mr. Clinton said.
At the same time, Administration officials acknowledged that they were postponing considering a Pentagon recommendation for a buildup of American forces in South Korea. They said they had concluded that this could jeopardize whatever prospects exist for a settlement.
"I don't think anyone feels it's prudent to make those kinds of decisions while we're trying to determine the veracity of what the North Koreans apparently said," a senior Defense Department official said today.
Mr. Carter reported to Administration officials over the weekend that North Korea would be willing to freeze all activity that produces fuel for nuclear weapons if Washington begins high-level talks. Today, Mr. Clinton stopped short of embracing Mr. Carter's view that the offer represents an end to the crisis, but he made clear his belief that Mr. Carter's visit might have created a diplomatic opening.
"If North Korea wishes to talk and is willing to freeze their nuclear program, that is, not continue the reprocessing and refueling while they talk, then that would be a step forward," the President said.
In a hint that future steps will be delicate, Mr. Clinton and his top foreign policy advisers met this afternoon with nearly a dozen experts on North Korea from outside Government in a session intended in part to seek their guidance on how best to proceed.

HEADLINE: Japan Faces a Difficult Goal on Auto Parts

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Tuesday, June 21

 BODY:
Figures released today suggest that Japan's auto makers will have difficulty meeting their voluntary goal of buying $19 billion of American automobile parts in the current fiscal year, industry officials said.
The Japanese manufacturers bought $15.54 billion of American parts in the fiscal year that ended in March, a gain of 14.1 percent from a year earlier, an official at the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association said today. The year before, purchases increased 30 percent. 
 To achieve the $19 billion goal in the year that ends next March, purchases will have to rise 22 percent -- growth that Japan's depressed auto industry may find hard to achieve, some officials say. It is "a very delicate situation right now," said Takumi Oue, a spokesman for the Japanese auto industry association.
Japanese manufacturers adopted what they called a voluntary plan in January 1992, when President George Bush visited Japan along with the heads of the Big Three auto makers.
In connection with the trade negotiations between Japan and the United States, the leading Japanese auto makers recently announced new voluntary plans for increasing foreign parts purchases beyond this year. Washington has called the plans insufficient.
Making the $19 billion goal is not out of the question, however, as the Japanese industry has been known to make extra efforts with a deadline approaching. In semiconductors, foreign manufacturers' market share in Japan shot up in a single quarter to surpass the 20 percent goal just at the deadline.
The $19 billion figure is the sum of a goal of importing $4 billion of American-made parts and buying $15 billion of parts for use in Japanese factories in the United States. Japanese auto executives have said it will be easier to reach the goal for parts used in their American plants. American parts have become more competitive in price as the yen has risen.
But executives have said it will be difficult to meet the goals for importing parts. Production of cars in Japan has been dropping because of the economic slump and because the yen's rise has cut Japan's exports.

HEADLINE: Laotians' Arrest in Killing Bares a Generation Gap

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BANNING, Calif.

 BODY:
Klaus and Gisela Pfleger, a retired German couple on vacation, were photographing spring flowers on a scenic hillside in May when three young men walked up to them, shot them in the head and drove away with Mrs. Pfleger's purse.
The attack, which killed Mrs. Pfleger and left her husband seriously injured, was the sort of gratuitous brutality that has become frighteningly common in Southern California among gangs, carjackers and thrill killers. But in this case, the police arrested three teen-agers whose backgrounds bewildered them. 
 They were Laotian refugees from America's "secret war" in Indochina during the Vietnam War, when the Central Intelligence Agency enlisted thousands of hill tribesmen to try to block the Ho Chi Minh supply trail into South Vietnam, an effort that proved to be futile.
Although the three teen-agers had grown up as Southern California boys who wore baggy hip-hop clothes and spoke the American slang of their generation, they were born in Laos, and two were members of the Hmong (pronounced "mung"), a clan-based people whose culture had no written language until recent times and centered on slash-and-burn farming.
 
Children Forsake Old WaysGeneration Gap
 The shootings, on May 16, bewildered members of the Hmong community here as well, including the families of the arrested teen-agers. Some 1,500 Hmong have followed their clan leaders to this city of 23,000 people in the smoggy Inland Empire, an area 50 miles east of Los Angeles.
Nu Yeng Yang, a toughened Hmong veteran of the war in Laos who came to the United States in 1980, maintained an awkward smile the other day as he talked of his alienation from his adopted country and his Americanized 19-year-old son, Xou Yang, who is being held pending his arraignment in the killing.
"Back in our country, you never saw things like this happen," Mr. Nu Yeng said. "There are no thieves, although our houses are not as nice as here. Nothing would come into your house except for the animals you own."
Like many Hmong parents -- and like many other immigrant parents through the decades -- he said there was little he could say to his son, Mr. Xou, to guide him in this strange new world, and that, in any case, his son had stopped listening to him.
 
'He Will Not Listen'
 "We have lost all control," Mr. Nu Yeng said. "Our children do not respect us. One of the hardest things for me is when I tell my children things and they say, 'I already know that.' When my wife and I try to tell my son about Hmong culture, he tells me people here are different, and he will not listen to me."
Mr. Nu Yeng's son is being held in the killing with a second 19-year-old, Khamchan Ketsouvannasane, and with a 17-year-old Hmong whose name has not been released because of his age.
Deputy District Attorney Richard Bentley, who is prosecuting the case, said the 17-year-old had fired the shots, accompanied by Mr. Khamchan, and that Mr. Xou had waited in their car. But he said he could not say whether they were members of a gang, as the police had initially suggested, or what might have led them to this sudden, brutal act.
Since the United States began accepting Hmong as refugees in 1980, more than 100,000 have come to the United States, clustering in places like Montana, Wisconsin, Virginia and central California. Some settled at the invitation of church or community groups, while some looked for small farm plots. Many followed a guerrilla leader, Vang Pao, to California.
In the first years after their arrival, the Hmong's culture brought them into conflict with American law because some engaged in the medicinal use of opium, the kidnapping of brides or the ritual slaughter of animals. A few have leaped the cultural divide, but most remain poor.
Most of the Hmong in Banning are from the Yang clan. By one account, they were drawn here when a contractor offered a few of them jobs building mobile homes. Others say it was simply cheap housing that attracted them.
 
Most Hmong on Welfare
 Some have found work in small factories or restaurants, but, because of cultural barriers and a lack of marketable skills, most Hmong, here and elsewhere, are on welfare. One of those on welfare is Mr. Xou's father, who has never held a civilian job. Mr. Nu Yeng, like many Hmong, is not sure how old he is. But he said that at about the age of 13, he had become a soldier and had fought on the American side until the fall of Laos to the communists in 1976. Before the fall, he rose to the rank of lieutenant and was in command of 100 men, he said.
Here in Banning, with his wife and his three school-aged children, he has little to do. He said he would like to return to Laos if the communist government changes.
For Mr. Nu Yeng, as for many other Hmong, the generation gap is one of the most disturbing signs of his alienation from his adopted country.
Pao Yang, who is earning a master's degree in sociology, noted that the very concept of teen-aged years is alien to the Hmong, who traditionally began working as farmers, or as soldiers during the war, when they were 13 or 14 years old.
"The Hmong go from childhood to adulthood; here, you have teen-agers or adolescents," he said. "We never had to raise our own children in that way, so it's very hard for people who have children who grow up here."
When Mr. Xou was a child, his father said, he was obedient, running errands and translating for his parents and helping his younger brother and sister with their schoolwork.
But as Mr. Xou grew older, things changed. "He would say to me, why are you still telling me all these things?" his father said. "I don't have to listen to you."
Mr. Xou dropped out of Banning High School after ninth grade. He held odd jobs, traveled out of state, was employed, and then unemployed. His parents lost track of what he was doing, until the police knocked on their door last month, saying he was wanted in connection with a shooting.

HEADLINE: Jose Fernandez, 70, Philippine Banker

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: MANILA, June 20

 BODY:
Jose B. Fernandez, who headed the Philippine Central Bank under Presidents Ferdinand E. Marcos and Corazon C. Aquino, died Sunday. He was 70.
Mr. Fernandez was reported to have died of cancer. 
 He was named governor of the Central Bank in 1983 at the height of a financial crisis after the assassination of Mrs. Aquino's husband, Senator Benigno Aquino.
His predecessor had been accused by the International Monetary Fund of padding the nation's reserves. Mr. Fernandez was credited with restoring international trust in the Philippine banking system.
He was retained in the post after the popular uprising in 1986 that forced Mr. Marcos from office and led to Mrs. Aquino's becoming the President.
After Mr. Marcos went into exile in Hawaii, Mr. Fernandez investigated reports that the former President and his wife had taken millions of dollars with them in Philippine currency and gold bullion. Mr. Fernandez began the Government's lengthy legal proceedings against them.
Mr. Fernandez was born in Laguna Province and was educated at Ateneo de Manila University. He also earned degrees from Fordham University and Harvard Business School.
He is survived by his wife, four sons and a daughter.

HEADLINE: Poll Shows Support for Giuliani on Not Cutting Police Budget

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS 

 BODY:
As Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani negotiates a budget with the City Council, a New York Times/WCBS-TV News Poll shows that a solid majority of New Yorkers supports his stance that the Police Department should be spared from the spending cuts that he is demanding of other agencies.
Reflecting their belief that crime is by far the most pressing problem that the Mayor should concentrate on, two out of three of those polled said Mr. Giuliani should continue to insulate the Police Department from personnel cuts and other economies that critics in the Council and elsewhere have said would help close the city budget gap without gutting other agencies. Women were most adamant in their support for police spending. 
 More broadly, the poll found that after Mr. Giuliani's first six months in office, New Yorkers approve of his performance by a 5-to-3 edge -- a job rating that falls somewhat short of his predecessor, David N. Dinkins, but about the same as Edward I. Koch in their first few months in office.
The poll, which was taken June 12 to 15 amid last week's euphoria of a hometown hockey championship but well before the city begins feeling the impact of Mr. Giuliani's budget cuts, found that 49 percent of the 1,189 people questioned said they approved of Mr. Giuliani's job performance while 31 percent disapproved. The margin of sampling error for all respondents was plus or minus 3 percentage points.
 
Comparison With Dinkins
 Mr. Giuliani's immediate predecessor, Mr. Dinkins, had a more impressive job rating after six months -- 56 percent approved and 23 percent did not. But Mr. Dinkins lost ground as his four-year term progressed.
Mr. Giuliani has fared about the same as Mr. Koch, whose performance was viewed favorably by a split of 45 percent to 31 percent at a comparable point in his first term but who was re-elected overwhelmingly twice.
In addition to approving of Mr. Giuliani's protection of the Police Department from budget cuts, most people did not seem very worried that cuts in other agencies would have a harmful effect on city services.
Four in 10 people said reducing the number of city workers eventually would decrease the quality of city services -- a response that reflected deep racial and ethnic cleavages. About 3 in 10 whites, more than 4 in 10 blacks and more than half the Hispanic people polled said services would decline. "Generally speaking, the poll shows support for those policies Rudy has pushed," said David Garth, who was Mr. Giuliani's chief campaign strategist. Comparing the relatively close margin by which Mr. Giuliani defeated Mr. Dinkins with the poll's differential on Mr. Giuliani's job rating, Mr. Garth said, "It should happen to everyone who wins an election to pick up about 18 points during a difficult period when he's trying to get a budget balanced."
Cristyne F. Lategano, the press secretary for Mr. Giuliani, said that the poll indicated "a tremendous support for the Mayor's commitment to public safety, even in the black community."
Blacks were the only racial group in which a majority of those polled said they disapproved of the way the Republican Mayor was handling crime. But a solid majority of all New Yorkers -- and a plurality of blacks -- said Mr. Giuliani's focus on crime was not diverting attention from other problems facing the city.
Not surprisingly, the poll found that black, Hispanic and white New Yorkers diverged sharply in their perspective on public officials and policy issues, as they did in last year's mayoral election when Mr. Giuliani, who is white, was challenging the city's first black Mayor. Those disparities were reflected in responses to questions ranging from the impact of personnel cuts on city services to whether Mayor Giuliani was devoting too much attention to the needs of some other racial or ethnic group.
Still, despite fears that Mr. Giuliani's defeat of Mr. Dinkins might worsen race relations, about 2 in 3 of all those polled said race relations have stayed about the same under Mr. Giuliani. More Hispanic people and whites said relations had improved than deteriorated. But while most blacks agreed that relations were pretty much unchanged, 3 in 10 said they had worsened.
Over all, about the same proportion of New Yorkers -- a little more than 1 in 10 -- said relations had got worse as did the proportion who said things had got better.
Those perceptions varied sharply with predictions before last year's election when, in a Times/WCBS-TV News Poll of registered voters, 1 in 4 predicted that race relations would worsen. The latest poll represented a cross section of all New Yorkers, not just voters.
At the corresponding point in the Dinkins administration, more than half the blacks and whites polled said race relations were worse than they had been a year earlier -- before the mayoral campaign began in earnest and before the racially motivated slaying in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, of a black man, Yusuf K. Hawkins.
Mr. Guiliani also seemed to improve his standing among blacks. Fully 25 percent of the blacks polled said they approved of his performance -- about 20 percentage points more than the proportion who voted for him last November. After six months as Mayor, Mr. Dinkins's job rating among whites was also about 20 points higher than it was in the voting the year before.
In detailed interviews after the poll was completed, several people who participated in it voiced strong approval of the specific efforts Mayor Giuliani has undertaken. Frances Kelly, who lives in Kingsbridge in the Bronx, applauded several of the Mayor's initiatives, including his budget cuts, his proposal to fingerprint welfare recipients and the campaign against aggressive squeegee-men.
"The most important thing that he can do is make sure that every person on welfare is fingerprinted," she said. "If you can fingerprint the President and the Governor, right on down to police and firemen, why can't the homeless be fingerprinted? Why can't they be treated like everybody else?"
Edward N. Brown, who was home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan from college out of town, said he was impressed that Mr. Giuliani was not beholden to entrenched politicians.
"At first, his ideas may seem idealistic, but I think that in an earnest sort of way he is trying to stick to those ideals," Mr. Brown said. "You hear a lot of talk about the cuts in the budget, but Giuliani says that he's going to cut costs without cutting services.
"I take a wait and see attitude toward it," Mr. Brown said. "I'm not saying he's perfect, but he's on the right track."
Others were not so sure.
Rosa Mercado, a mother from the South Bronx who is H.I.V.-positive, expressed concern that the administration's policies were hurting the prospects for herself and for her 3-year-old daughter. Also, she said that while she sees more police officers, "they just don't do anything" to reduce drug dealing in her neighborhood.
"I see things Dinkins has done," she said. "I just don't see anything that Giuliani has done except cut the budgets."
Most people did not seem surprised by the new Mayor and his policies. More than 6 in 10 said that for better or for worse Mr. Giuliani was fulfilling their expectations about his performance.
The poll found that Hispanic New Yorkers were the most disappointed; nearly 1 in 4 said the Mayor was doing worse than they had anticipated. So did about 2 in 10 blacks and 1 in 10 whites. Conversely, nearly 3 in 10 whites and about 1 in 10 blacks and Hispanic people said Mr. Giuliani's performance so far had surpassed their expectations.
Given the city's disproportionate share of Democrats, the results may not bode well for Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who is seeking a fourth term this year.
The Democratic Governor managed a comparable approval rating (51 percent) to Mr. Giuliani but also a larger proportion of people who disapproved of Mr. Cuomo's performance (37 percent). Four years ago a Times/WCBS-TV News Poll found that 59 percent in the city approved of Mr. Cuomo's job performance and 24 percent did not.

Prices Rebound From Day's Lows

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were mixed yesterday, rebounding from their lows of the day to trim earlier losses attributed to the weak dollar. A steep drop in commodity prices that eased investor fears about inflation brought the market back.
With no economic news yesterday, the market was also looking at a large supply of new Treasury issues this week, which added some anxiety. The supply is coming as traders adjust positions before the quarter ends. 
 Traders cited the dollar's weakness as setting the bearish tone, encouraging talk among bondholders of a possible raising of short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve coming sooner rather than later.
 
Long Bond Yield 7.46%
 The 30-year bond fell 6/32 , to 8522/32 , for a yield of 7.46 percent, up from 7.44 percent on Friday. Market traders said the yield was up as high as 7.50 percent before a falling commodity-price index gave the market some relief.
Prices also slipped in the note market, while the rates at yesterday's weekly bill auction came in mixed. The average rate for a three-month bill was 4.18 percent, down a couple of basis points from last week, and the six-month was unchanged at 4.55 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Joseph V. Battipaglia, managing director of Sterling Advisors, thought that the most revealing element of yesterday's trading was how the dollar declined on no discernible financial news. "The market is now questioning, will the Fed tighten in a dollar slump?" said Mr. Battipaglia, who added he did not think so. "It's not at that critical point yet where the Fed would have to act. But it is creating a great deal of uncertainty."
Mr. Battipaglia said he believed there were no compelling reasons why the Fed would raise rates now. "The economy has slowed because of previous interest rate hikes and the inflation numbers have not jumped out of the trend they've been in." he said.
 
Commodity Index Retreats
 The Commodity Research Bureau index retreated yesterday from levels not seen since mid-1990, levels that were regenerating inflation fears. As such, the pullback was a relief for the bond market, since many market participants use the index as a measure of future price pressure. The C.R.B. index, a basket of commodity futures contracts, fell 4.51 points, to 234.87. Rain in the Midwest and speculation that the heat wave is ending resulted in sharply lower call for the grains, with precious metals getting caught up in the decline, traders said.
"For the last three years at this time the market has had inflation fears that are food-commodity related," Mr. Battipaglia said. "Either a drought or talk of one would raise fears and cause commodity prices to surge. And each and every time that fear was ill founded."
As an example, he cited last year's flooding in the Midwest, which saw commodity prices surge but then fall back.
Today, the Treasury will auction $17 billion of new two-year notes and in late when-issued trading yesterday the issue was being offered at a price to yield 5.95 percent, up from Friday's 5.91 percent. The five-year note to be auctioned on Wednesday was offered at a price to yield 6.76 percent.
 
Some See Rate Rise
 Yesterday's rise in rates did find many analysts seeing the potential for a rate increase at the July meeting of the Fed's Open Market Committee, which sets the central bank's monetary policy for months ahead, had increased.
"While the dollar is not the primary policy determinant," said James Hale, a fixed-income analyst with MMS International, "it is a factor that contributes to an already compelling list of reasons why the Fed will continue to raise rates. Even before the latest round of dollar declines, we viewed economic growth as sufficient to warrant a continuation of the tightening course."
The market, he added, is just barely acknowledging the risk of a July rate increase.
As Treasuries bounced from their lows, some bond investors took the opportunity to sell and limited any chance of gains on the day, traders said.
Tomorrow the Federal Reserve is scheduled to release its beige book economic survey for May and part of June. Analysts say the report should offer a clearer picture of the United States inflation scene and set the stage for a two-day meeting of the Fed's Open Market Committee meeting on July 5 and 6.
The following are the results of yesterday's auction of three- and six-month Treasury bills:
 
 (000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	98.943	97.700	Discounted Rate	4.18%	4.55%	Coupon Yield	4.28%	4.72%	High Price	98.948	97.710	Discounted Rate	4.16%	4.53%	Coupon Yield	4.26%	4.70%	Low Price	98.943	97.695	Discounted Rate	4.18%	4.56%	Coupon Yield	4.28%	4.73%	Accepted at low price	40%	24%	Total applied for	$55,431,010	$45,547,910	Accepted	$12,146,794	$12,116,834	Noncompetitive	$1,274,435	$1,056,908	
 
Both issues are dated June 24, 1994. The three-month bills mature on Sept. 22, 1994, and the six-month bills mature on Dec. 22, 1994.

HEADLINE: Dow Drops 34.88 After the Dollar Tumbles

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE 

 BODY:
The stock market fell sharply yesterday for the second consecutive session, after a steep drop in the dollar and a selloff in European stocks.
The dollar tumbled to an eight-month low against the German mark. A weak dollar typically depresses the price of stocks in this country because of expected cost and price increases. 
 In Europe, stocks were down sharply after traders saw inflation worsening and interest rates rising in the United States. Leading stock indexes plummeted more than 1.5 percent in Britain and France and about 4 percent in Germany and Italy.
"The downside performance over the last two days has muted thoughts about a summer rally," said Alan Ackerman, executive vice president of Reich & Company. "But with short positions due out after the market closes on Tuesday, we may have a knee-jerk reaction on the upside."
 
 
Fear of Higher Rates
 The Dow Jones industrial average slumped 34.88 points, to 3,741.90, its largest decline in five weeks. The Dow fell sharply at the opening bell amid concern that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates for the fifth time this year, perhaps at the next meeting of its policy-making group early next month.
Other key indicators also pointed downward. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks dropped 2.97 points, to 455.48, while the Nasdaq composite index declined 10.50 points, to 718.85, in keeping with the bigger declines taken by stocks of smaller companies.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange fell to a very light 229.5 million shares, from 387 million shares on Friday, when turnover was increased by triple-witching trading, which stems from the simultaneous expiration of three sets of options and futures contracts. Declining stocks outnumbered advancers on the Big Board, 1,748 to 495.
Stocks sensitive to changes in interest rates were among the day's biggest declines. Among banking companies, J. P. Morgan was down 3/8, to 63 7/8; Wells Fargo fell 7/8, to 154; Citicorp dropped 7/8, to 39 3/4, and Banc One slipped 1/2, to 36.
Cyclical shares that are sensitive to current economic activity also came under pressure, suggesting that the United States economy may face a slowdown. Caterpillar fell 2 3/8, to 106 3/8; Bethlehem Steel dropped 1 1/4, to 20 1/8, and Chrysler declined 7/8, to 47 7/8. .
Oil stocks were weak during the day as investors were rattled by higher crude oil prices that could affect profits from refining and marketing. Among them were Mobil, off 1/4, to 84 1/4; Royal Dutch/Shell Group, off 7/8, to 106 7/8; Exxon, off 1/8, to 58 5/8, and British Petroleum, off 7/8, to 74.
Semiconductor issues gave ground, following Micron Technology's announcement on Friday that third-quarter earnings would be lower than some analysts had estimated. Micron declined 7/8, to 32 3/4; Texas Instruments dropped 1 5/8, to 76 1/2, and Intel fell 1 1/8, to 58 7/8.
Some stocks, however, bucked the negative trend on Wall Street. Quaker Oats was up 3 3/8, to 81 7/8, on speculation that the company might be a takeover target. Kellogg, apparently moving in sympathy with Quaker Oats, advanced 1 3/8, to 56 3/8.
Philip Morris, the second-most-active stock on the New York exchange, gained 3/8, to 50 3/4, after two senior managers replaced Michael A. Miles, the chairman and chief executive.

HEADLINE: Japan Gives U.S. Cars a 2d Look

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 20

 BODY:
After years of being derided as overpriced, defect-prone gas guzzlers, something unexpected is happening to American cars in Japan. They are starting to win some consumer acceptance.
Sales of passenger cars made in the United States by Ford, General Motors and Chrysler more than doubled here in the first five months of this year, compared with the period a year earlier, even as overall car sales declined amid an economic slump. The gains follow a 37 percent increase in Big Three imports to Japan in 1993 from 1992. 
 To be sure, sales of Detroit's cars here are still puny, and it will be many years before they grow enough to dent the roughly $20 billion annual trade deficit in vehicles that the United States runs with Japan.
 
 
Market Share: Less Than 1%
 The Big Three expect to sell about 35,000 American-made cars here this year, compared with 19,335 last year, giving them a market share of a little less than 1 percent. By contrast, Japanese companies export nearly 1.5 million passenger cars to the United States. Counting their North American production, they control 29 percent of the car market in the United States and 23 percent of combined sales of cars and light trucks.
Still, American auto executives are encouraged by the rapid growth in the Japanese market and by what they see as a gradual change in consumer attitudes since January 1992, when then-President George Bush was ridiculed on a visit here for trying to foist clunky American cars on the Japanese. The rising acceptance seems prompted more by the delivery of better-made cars suitable for the Japanese than by encouragement from the Tokyo Government.
"The consumers' mental barrier started to melt late last year," said Konen Suzuki, president of Ford Japan.
Jack K. Yamaguchi, an automobile writer here, agreed. "This year and next will be the turning point for American cars," he said.
 
 
Ford Packs Them In
 On a recent Sunday, in a scene that might have been unimaginable a few years ago, the showroom of Ford Seijo, a dealership in western Tokyo, was bustling with customers eyeing the Mustang, the newly introduced Mondeo and the Taurus station wagon. An American flag flew on the street outside. Just down the street, a huge Nissan showroom was devoid of customers and its salesmen sat forlornly at their desks.
"I have never even started an American car before," said Hajime Sakai, a 27-year-old hotel employee who was considering a Mustang. "The styling of American cars has really become quite good."
Spurring the gain has been the rise of the Japanese yen, which has made imports' prices more competitive with those of Japanese products. Overall passenger car imports, including European autos and cars made by Japanese companies overseas, are up 30 percent this year. In May alone, imports held a record 8.6 percent of the Japanese car market.
But Detroit has also helped itself by introducing new models better suited for Japan, by advertising more aggressively and by courting Japanese automobile magazine writers.
Chrysler's sales have more than quadrupled this year, following the introduction last year of a Jeep Cherokee with the steering wheel on the right side. The Japanese, like the British, drive on the left.
Ford's new Mustang, introduced last month with a highly competitive base price of less than $23,000, has exceeded all expectations. Ford expected to sell 2,500 Mustangs in Japan this year; it will reach that total in the first two months.
Product quality has also improved. "Nowadays people don't worry about the quality" of American cars, said Toru Hoki, a dentist who had just purchased a Taurus at Ford Seijo. His view is not shared by all Japanese. Hiroyuki Moriyama, a businessman who also looked at a Taurus, said some owners had told him that American cars still broke down.
The recent gains in American car sales seem to buttress Tokyo's arguments in its trade negotiations with Washington. Japanese officials say the nation's automobile market is not closed. American companies have done poorly here, they say, because they have not introduced cars with right-hand steering that are small enough and inexpensive enough for Japan's market. When they do introduce a suitable model, sales take off.
 
 
'Real Commitments'
 But United States Government and industry officials say they will not relax their demands, because sales of American cars here are still far below what they would be if the market were truly open. "The Big Three are making real commitments to this market, but we have still not seen any dramatic commitment on the part of the Japanese Government," Andrew H. Card Jr., president of the American Automobile Manufacturers Association, said in Tokyo today.
Washington has asked that goals be set for increasing the number of Japanese dealers carrying foreign cars. American officials say the dealers who sell Toyotas, Nissans or other Japanese cars do not readily take on foreign models because of financial ties to Japanese manufacturers or because they fear disturbing relationships with their main suppliers.
Government and industry officials insist that dealers are free to carry other brands. "It never occurred to me to sell another car besides Nissan," said Hiroshi Iwai, a dealer from a suburb of Tokyo.
The number of Japanese dealers that offer foreign cars has risen to 530 this year from 85 in 1988, according to the Japan Automobile Importers' Association. There are about 2,000 car dealers in Japan, most of whom have more than one outlet.
In the 1980's, sales grew of foreign cars, mainly from Germany. BMW and Mercedes-Benz models were seen as offering high quality and snob appeal. But as Japan's economy soured, German imports, which peaked at 137,000 in 1990, began dropping. While German cars still vastly outsell vehicles from the United States, the Americans are gaining.
Some American cars sell because of their novelty or, like the Mustang, their fame. Even now, American companies are not in the mainstream of the market. About 80 percent of the cars sold in Japan have engine sizes of less than 2 liters and prices of less than 3 million yen, or about $30,000, according to the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association. But no American-made cars are sold in that category here, and right-hand-drive models are still scarce.
The American companies differ in their tactics. Ford has been the most aggressive, introducing its new Mustang and Mondeo at prices that match or undercut those of comparable Japanese models. Imports had previously been much more expensive than Japanese-built cars.
Ford also controls its own dealer network, through which it sells not only imports but also cars made for it by the Mazda Motor Corporation, of which Ford owns nearly 25 percent.
Ford, which began running television commercials this year, expects sales of its imports to triple this year to 15,000. It wants to sell 200,000 cars here in the year 2000, of which about half would be imported. To do that, it plans to expand its dealer network to 700 outlets, from 288 now.
So far this year it has recruited four Nissan outlets, and Mr. Suzuki, the president of Ford Japan, hopes to attract a total of 20 or 30 this year. Japanese dealers are becoming more receptive, he said, not only because of American pressure but also because many dealers are losing money and are desperate for new products.
This month, Ford began selling its first two imported cars with right-hand steering wheels: the Mondeo, made in Europe, and the Probe, made at a joint Mazda-Ford plant in Michigan.
Chrysler's spurt in sales has come exclusively from the Jeep Cherokee. Chrysler introduced a right-hand-drive version early last year and cut the base price 30 percent, to about $37,000. It subsequently introduced an even less expensive model.
Honda, which sells the Jeep through its dealers, minutely inspects each vehicle to make sure it will satisfy Japanese consumers. Customers here are known to reject a car because of a tiny scratch in the paint. But Hiroshi Saito, a Honda dealer, said Chrysler also risked alienating customers because of a shortage of the least expensive Jeep.
 
 
Chrysler May Be Vulnerable
 Without its own dealer network, some analysts say, Chrysler remains vulnerable should Honda develop its own competing product or should the Jeep's popularity wane.
Chrysler expects to sell 13,000 vehicles here this year, more than double last year's total. It recently tripled the size of its office in Tokyo and is recruiting new dealers. In the next few years, it also plans to import right-hand-drive versions of its low-priced Neon and of a new mini-van.
General Motors has largely missed out on the recent gains. After long being the largest seller of American cars in Japan, G.M. will be surpassed this year by both Ford and Chrysler. Its German subsidiary, Opel, sells cars here separately.
Still, G.M., which expects to sell 9,000 cars in Japan this year, has seen its sales rise 11 percent so far. And its truck sales, while still small, have more than doubled.
But analysts say that General Motors and its single Japanese dealer have not priced G.M. cars aggressively, compared with Japanese cars or even with other imports. The company's Camaro sporty car, for instance, sells for almost $10,000 more than the new Ford Mustang.

HEADLINE: Dollar's Slump May Push Fed To Raise Rates

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 20

 BODY:
The continued fall of the dollar in international currency markets today put new pressure on the Federal Reserve to consider a fifth interest rate increase this year, as stock markets dropped sharply around the world.
Even though Federal Reserve officials were unwilling to say so publicly today, they have privately signaled this spring their willingness to stop any steep slumps in the dollar's value by raising short-term interest rates again -- even if that further slows the pace of American economic growth. 
 Their recent comments that inflation was under control always carried the caveat that all bets were off if a new threat appeared, notably a drop in the value of the dollar or a big jump in commodity prices.
The choice between the domestic economy's short-term health and helping the dollar with higher interest rates is a staple of economic textbooks. For the Federal Reserve, such a choice is particularly painful now. After its fourth increase in short-term interest rates in as many months, the Federal Reserve said in May that it had "substantially" completed its current round of interest rate increases.
"It's a bad dream," said John H. Makin, a resident economist at the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington research organization. "No central banker wants to be in the position of thinking they've raised interest rates enough and then global capital markets don't think so."
Responding to the weak dollar, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped almost 35 points, the London and Paris stock markets fell and the German market in Frankfurt suffered its worst one-day loss since 1991. [Page D2.]
The dollar fell to 1.5995 German marks and an anemic 101.95 Japanese yen today on fears of growing imports and shrinking American exports, higher oil prices and what traders said was a lack of confidence in the Clinton Administration's foreign policy. All three factors unnerve investors who fear slower economic growth, faster inflation and political uncertainty.
While the dollar has been weaker against the mark, including a postwar low of 1.386 marks to the dollar during a European currency crisis in September 1992, the level is low enough now that German brewers and Japanese car makers will be under pressure to raise prices in the United States to collect their anticipated revenues and profits. Today's closing level was the lowest for the dollar against the mark since October and the lowest against the yen since early May.
 
A Difficult Position
 The dollar's fall puts top Federal Reserve officials in a quandary. Raising interest rates would tend to halt the dollar's fall by making American bonds more attractive to international investors who must buy dollars to acquire Treasury bonds. But higher rates would hurt American economic growth.
Leaving interest rates untouched might help the economy now but would risk further drops in the dollar, perhaps feeding inflation as prices for imported goods would tend to rise.
Oil prices have also risen rapidly in the last week, climbing another 4 cents a barrel today, to $20.75. But prices for other commodities, notably corn and soybeans, dropped today.
Top Federal Reserve officials had believed that by raising short-term interest rates four times this spring -- the last time as recently as May 17 -- they had successfully prevented a burst of runaway economic growth. Such a rapid expansion could have fed inflation by forcing companies to pay more for scarce materials and highly trained workers. But just as the economy had seemed to be settling into a steady rhythm of growth, the dollar began falling again.
If interest rates on long-term bonds rise to 8 percent or higher, as some economists now predict, then fewer Americans will be able to afford car loans and home mortgages, fewer cars and houses will probably be built and the economy will slow. Higher interest rates would also tend to push down stock prices, as corporations are forced to pay more to borrow money and as demand for their products slows.
Complicating the Federal Reserve's difficulty is the scheduled release on Tuesday of the nation's trade balance in April, which is expected to show deterioration from March and may put further downward pressure on the dollar. And on Wednesday, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, whose words can roil even relatively quiet markets, is scheduled to testify before a House panel.
Still, the biggest problem now for the Federal Reserve is that the economy is already showing some signs of weakening.
"I think that in the nation as a whole, we've seen some slight slowing of activity," Robert P. Forrestal, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, said in an interview on June 6. Three of the five sitting governors of the Federal Reserve Board in Washington expressed similar sentiments two weeks ago.
 
A View From the South
 Some of the Federal Reserve's regional governors are more guarded.
For instance, J. Alfred Broaddus Jr., the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, which keeps track of economic conditions in Maryland, Virginia, the Carolinas and part of West Virginia, said last week in referrence to housing and car sales, "On balance, the information we have on our district suggests the possibility -- not the certainty but the possibility -- of some deceleration in some segments of the economy."
Lawrence Summers, the Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs, said today that the American economy was still in good shape. "Economic fundamentals are very strong, this is the first investment-led recovery from a low inflation base that the United States has had since the Kennedy Administration," he said.
Although currency traders seldom mention it, one possible reason for the fall in the dollar lies not in the United States but in Europe. Interest rates have been rising there as central banks, led by the Bundesbank in Germany, have proved less willing to reduce interest rates than many investors had expected. This has made the German mark more attractive to investors seeking higher interest rates and the dollar, by default, less attractive.
Even if the dollar continues to fall, economists at the Federal Reserve and elsewhere disagree about the precise effects on inflation. Only a third to two-fifths of the American economy consists of goods subject to international competition.
Many industries, from residential construction to medical care and other services, are virtually immune to international competition. Their prices presumably would be little affected by how much it costs to build a house in Hamburg or to have a sprained ankle treated in Osaka.
New figures from the Commerce Department last week showed that prices in service industries are rising at the slowest pace in a decade, a phenomenon that might offset part or all of any rise in prices for tradable goods.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Tumbles as Investors Seek Higher Yields Abroad

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar continued to slide against the German mark and other currencies yesterday as slumping global stock and bond prices encouraged many investors to shift their money into cash deposits in countries like Germany that have high interest rates.
"As people move out of bonds and into cash, they're going for the highest yields," said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics. "Dollar yields are the lowest of any market in the world except Japan." 
 The dollar traded as low as 1.5965 German marks yesterday, its weakest level since last October. In late New York trading, it was at 1.5995 marks, down more than one pfennig from 1.6105 marks on Friday.
The dollar also fell to 101.95 Japanese yen, from 102.70 on Friday.
The dollar weakened against the mark as a selloff in the German bond market pushed up German interest rates. Most German interest rates were already higher than those for United States Government securities with comparable maturities, making mark-denominated securities more attractive. The yield on three-month German Government securities is 4.953 percent, for instance, compared with 4.18 percent for three-month Treasury bills.
But the dollar steadied just above the day's lows amid speculation that the Federal Reserve and other central banks were poised to support the dollar again as they did on May 4.
"The markets are jittery," Lynn Tierney, a trader at Shawmut Bank in Boston, said. "Everyone is wary of central bank intervention at these levels."
Yesterday's drop in the dollar continues a decline that has been under way for much of the year. The dollar has dropped 8 percent against the mark and 9 percent against the yen so far this year, hurt by slumping American stock and bond prices and concerns about the Clinton Administration's trade policies.
The Swiss franc also gained yesterday, rising to a 20-month high of 1.3428 francs to the dollar, from 1.3557 francs on Friday.
"Sentiment toward the dollar is very poor," said Paul Farrell, manager of strategic currency trading at Chase Manhattan Bank. "There's an air of nervousness in the market."
The dollar tumbled 1.5 percent against the mark on Friday. Some of the selling was attributed to a statement by Gail Fosler, the chief economist at the Conference Board, who said that the dollar would probably fall to 1.50 marks by the end of 1995. But a number of traders said Ms. Fosler's statement was more of an excuse to sell dollars in a market that has become increasingly bearish about the dollar.
Indeed, the fact that the dollar fell so far on comments from a non-Government economist showed that the currency was weaker than they had thought, analysts said.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Former Philip Morris Chief Leaves Name-Brand Legacy

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT 

 BODY:
Whatever happens to Michael A. Miles after his unexpected resignation as the chairman and chief executive of the Philip Morris Companies, one huge gamble he made will continue to fundamentally reshape American consumer-product marketing.
Mr. Miles may be no Julius Caesar, but there was widespread agreement yesterday that his most surprising decision will live on after him rather than be interred with his Philip Morris career. That was, of course, his move on Friday, April 2, 1993, to sharply cut the price of the company's flagship cigarette brand, Marlboro, to stem the loss of sales to cheaper competitors. 
 Mr. Miles later tried to split off the cigarette business, a failed move that helped lead to his departure over the weekend and upset some big shareholders. [Page D4.]
But the impact of his cigarette price cuts, felt initially by the tobacco industry, has widened to include virtually every name brand under siege from lower-priced rivals.
"It was a seminal moment," said Watts Wacker, a managing partner of Yankelovich Partners Inc., a consumer marketing research company in Norwalk, Conn.
"The 1980's ended on that day," he added, referring to that decade's prizing of image and status over price and value. "Now people tell us that rather than buy brands because 'they tell people I've made it,' they say they buy brands because 'they minimize exposure to risk.' "
The effect has been startling. Now, even when commodity prices rise rapidly, as is happening with coffee, marketers are raising selling prices slowly, if at all, for fear that consumers will abandon brand names for less expensive private-label products.
Mr. Miles's own risky move suddenly reversed a skein of hefty price increases, running 8 to 10 percent a year, that threatened the hegemony of Marlboro, the world's best-selling cigarette. Since the late 1980's, as smokers switched in droves to discount and private-label products, which often cost half as much as Marlboro, the brand remained No. 1, but its market share fell from 25 percent to low as 22 percent in the United States. Each percentage point of market share in the $48 billion American cigarette industry is worth $480 million.
Mr. Miles's abrupt strategic shift, announced without warning, was deemed so significant that it has entered the marketing and advertising lexicon under the nickname Marlboro Friday.
"It certainly was a day of reckoning in the consumer packaged-goods industry," John McMillin, food industry analyst for Prudential Securities in New York, said, "Not because he was the first but because it was so dramatic a move."
Before Marlboro Friday, he added, the rule of thumb seemed to be "to raise your price every year by a figure equal to the rate of inflation, even if your costs didn't go up."
"But when the spread between private label and your brand gets to 50 percent," he continued, "it can bring down even the strongest of brands."
Frank Assumma, president and chief executive of Bates U.S.A., formerly Backer Spielvogel Bates Inc., in New York, asserted that "Marlboro Friday said, 'Stop, everybody!'
"It was about getting the price/ value equation into perspective," he added. "Until then, there was no point where someone said, 'Whoa, we've got to slow down our price increases because consumers are telling us the value isn't there.' Now we know that people are willing to pay a premium for brand names -- but there's a limit."
"It was a very courageous decision, a watershed," Mr. Assumma said of Mr. Miles's drastic step.
Indeed, for those marketers who have scrambled to learn the lessons of Marlboro Friday in altering how to sell name-brand products to consumers, it was a D-Day that for several has proved to be a V-E Day. Others who refused to absorb the implications of Mr. Miles's about-face are finding Marlboro Friday the equivalent of a Pearl Harbor Day for their own brands.
The most significant discovery "is a correlation between brand loyalty and price sensitivity," said Larry Light, chairman of the Arcature Corporation, a marketing consulting company in Stamford, Conn., and of the Coalition for Brand Equity, a group formed by the marketing and advertising industries in the wake of Marlboro Friday.
"Many marketers fell into the trap of overcharging their most loyal consumers on the assumption they'd pay anything," he added. "But brand loyalty, it turns out, is not a license to overcharge the consumer.
"They ripped off their best customers, while at the same time, they rewarded disloyal customers."
Mr. Miles, according to Mr. Light, was among the first consumer marketers to realize the paradoxical truth that "you can increase sales, and even profits, in the short term by increasing prices and emphasizing promotions -- while hurting loyalty."
Emanuel Goldman, who follows the tobacco industry for Paine Webber Inc. in San Francisco, said that before Mr. Miles, the constant price rises by Philip Morris (and other cigarette marketers following the leader) touched off "a mix downgrade" among smokers -- that is, they abandoned premium, higher-priced, higher-profit brands like Marlboro, Winston and Newport for cheaper, lower-profit smokes like Basic, Doral and GPC Approved.
As a result, at Philip Morris the percentage of premium brands sold fell from "the mid- to high-80's five or six years ago," he added, to 71 percent last year.
"In the first quarter of 1994, that percentage has risen to 79 percent," Mr. Goldman said, after Mr. Miles cut Marlboro prices about 40 cents a pack.
And Philip Morris said yesterday that Marlboro's market share, as of May 31, has rebounded from 22 percent to more than 28 percent -- a record level.
There has, of course, been a price paid for this. At Philip Morris, Mr. Goldman and Mr. McMillin estimated, lost profits totaled more than $2 billion since Marlboro Friday.
And there was speculation that Mr. Miles might have paid the price of his job, Mr. McMillin said. Marlboro Friday represented a direct contradiction of his predecessors' belief that "he should have milked the cow as long as the cow could give milk" -- in other words, keep raising prices until the name brands went dry.
"Mike Miles, above anything, is a marketing man," he added. "He might be second-guessed for the move, but I've sensed he had no queasiness about it.
"He felt he did what he had to do."

HEADLINE: 2,000 Go on Strike at General Dynamics

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WARREN, Mich., June 20

 BODY:
About 2,000 workers went on strike at General Dynamics plants in Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania this morning, but the company, a military contractor, said it could not remain competitive if it gave in to the union's demands.
A United Auto Workers spokesman, Bob Barbee, said the strikers included white-collar, production and maintenance workers at factories making tanks and other land-based equipment in Warren and Sterling Heights, Mich.; Lima, Ohio, and Scranton, Pa. 
 Talks on a new three-year contract began in April. The old pact expired on Saturday, Mr. Barbee said. No new negotiations were scheduled.
The sticking points include the cost of employees' health insurance and vacations and the question of how long salaried workers at a plant would continue to get paid if the company shut it down, Mr. Barbee said.
A spokesman for General Dynamics, Pete Keating, would not discuss the cause of the breakdown in negotiations, except to say: "The major issue that needs to be resolved is economic.

HEADLINE: Co-op Board Files Suit Against Management Company

BYLINE: By MARY B. W. TABOR 

 BODY:
In the latest fallout from a wide-ranging real-estate corruption scandal, the board of an East Side cooperative has filed a civil lawsuit in Federal District Court in Manhattan claiming that "hundreds" of residents were cheated out of "tens of millions of dollars" by one of the city's most prominent management companies.
The class action suit, filed on Thursday against Brown Harris Stevens, came one day after more than 80 New York real-estate managers and management companies were charged or pleaded guilty in connection with bribery in the maintenance of some of New York City's most prestigious cooperative and condominium apartment buildings. 
 The suit, filed by the Park Avenue and 84th Street Corporation on behalf of other co-ops managed by Brown Harris, contends that the company's employees, by demanding kickbacks from contractors doing work at the buildings, caused residents to be overcharged by as much as 10 percent. Law-enforcement officials said yesterday that the civil action is the first of what they expect to be many related suits by building owners and residents.
 
Manager Indicted
 The Park Avenue and 84th Street Corporation, made up of the owners of about 30 apartments at 103 East 84th Street, was managed by Brown Harris from at least the 1970's until 1993, said Fred Taylor Isquith, a lawyer for the plaintiffs. Its managing agent, Noel Intner, who worked first for Brown Harris, then Century Operating, was named in the indictment last week.
Daniel J. Castleman, chief of the investigations division for District Attorney Robert Morgenthau, declined to say yesterday whether the 84th Street building was involved in the investigation.
But Mr. Isquith insisted the 84th Street building, one of about 80 apartment buildings managed by Brown Harris, had been systematically overcharged by about 10 percent for maintenance and services, including elevator repairs, a new boiler, brickwork, a new roof and plumbing.
The bills for those services, which totaled between $200,000 and $300,000 over the last five years or so, were paid for out of the apartment owners' monthly maintenance fees, which range from $1,600 to $2,600, he said.
 
'Shocking Situation'
 "This is a really shocking situation," Mr. Isquith said. "The thought that people have to pay bribes or kickbacks or the like to get a telephone installed or plumbing fixed or roof repaired is part of the reason, I think, that New York's economy isn't as strong as it should be."
Last week, Brown Harris, which saw 17 of its past and present managing agents charged in the scandal, acknowledged that it had failed to supervise its employees properly and agreed to pay $1 million in restitution into a fund for aggrieved residents. The company also agreed to engage an inspector general to monitor its practices. Calls to the company were not returned yesterday.
Investigators disclosed in March that they had found managers routinely extorting millions of dollars annually from painters, plumbers and other contractors for the right to work in the managers' buildings.
But the indictments last week indicated for the first time that the corruption extended to the top levels of some management companies, where, prosecutors said, some executives shared the graft.

Rain Sends Grains Down And Price Index Plummets

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Scattered thunderstorms across the parched Midwest sent grain prices reeling yesterday, causing selling that caused a key commodity price index to fall sharply.
Limit-down price moves in the Chicago corn and soybean markets were largely responsible for the Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities to tumble 4.51 points, to 234.87. On Friday, the index had reached a three-and-a-half-year high of 239.38 points. 
 Among other commodities that declined were cotton, lumber, coffee, cocoa, sugar, gasoline and metals.
"Certainly more rain fell than was expected," said Mark Cermak of Prudential Securities, explaining the steep fall in grain prices. "The distortion in the maps on Friday that got everyone very friendly for this week didn't pan out this morning," he added.
 
Grains Are Volatile
 The grain market has been volatile of late, as successive high-pressure systems settled over the Midwest and left some growing areas thirsty for rain. But scattered thunderstorms through the region, especially indrought-stricken northeastern Illinois, including Chicago, broke the bullish psychology.
July soybeans plummeted 30 cents, to $6.81 a bushel. July corn sank its 12-cent limit to $2.71 1/4. July oats lost 3.25 cents, to $1.34, and July wheat declined 13.25 cents, to $3.22 a bushel.
After the close of trading, a state-by-state crop report summary showed that 77 percent of the corn crop was in good or better condition, belying worries that a lack of rain this spring had hurt most crops. The soybean crop was described as in good to excellent condition in 68 percent of fields.
The steep fall in grain prices in turn caused a drop in the Commodity Research Bureau's index, and speculators chose to get out of positions in a variety of commodities.
Prices for inflation-sensitive metals also sagged, with August gold down $2.80, to $390.90 an ounce, and July silver off 11.8 cents, to $5.475 an ounce. High-flying July copper fell 1.4 cents, to 112.15 cents a pound.
Included among the declining commodities was cotton, which dropped its 2-cent limit to close at 77.66 cents a pound in the July contract.
A soft cash market caused July lumber prices to fall $8, to $365.30 for 1,000 board feet.
Oil prices ended nearly unchanged in a volatile session at the New York Mercantile Exchange after prices staged wild swings.
The July crude oil contract, which expires today, ended 4 cents higher at $20.75 a barrel after trading in a range of $19.35 to $20.89.
July gasoline and heating oil both lost 0.55 cent a gallon, with gasoline down to 54.65 cents a gallon and heating oil to 51.47 cents.

HEADLINE: Europe's Case of Jitters Worsens

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LONDON, June 20

 BODY:
Europe's financial markets were racked by another spasm of anxiety today as stocks and bonds tumbled in value in all the major financial centers and the dollar, the linchpin of the international financial system, slid to ominously low levels.
Although Europe has seen steady signs in recent weeks that its long recession is ending, today's financial carnage left investors shaken and worried that the broad-based selloff would continue. The turmoil also added to uncertainty in the United States, where worries at the end of last week about inflation and predictions of a weakening dollar had set off a round-the-world wave of selling that failed to subside over the weekend. 
 The main stock exchange index in Frankfurt fell nearly 4 percent, its steepest one-day drop since 1991, and long-term interest rates were forced sharply upward as investors fled bonds. Stock markets in London, Paris and Milan also had big drops.
 
Volatility in Germany
 Frankfurt's DAX index lost 81.90 points today to close at 1,968.82, its low for the year. The index hit a record high of 2,271.11 just over a month ago.
In London, the largest of the European markets, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading shares closed down 51.8 points at 2,971.1. In Paris, the CAC-40 index closed at 1,903.4, down 32.91.
The dollar also weakened through much of the trading day in Europe, and breached the psychologically important level of 1.60 German marks, before stabilizing slightly below that level. A week ago the dollar stood at 1.6685 marks.
The day was bad enough for investors and traders. But it also highlighted a problem for those who make economic and monetary policy: the growing mismatch between the globalized financial markets, where money and investment decisions zip around the world at warp speed, and the needs of national economies, which still look to markets to reflect their individual situations.
 
Not the Usual Pattern
 By traditional measures, Germany, France and other big European nations should be enjoying relatively low long-term interest rates. Inflation is low and should remain in check for some time because factories have plenty of idle capacity, lots of workers are still looking for jobs and consumers are in no mood to spend.
But the markets have largely ignored those factors and have focused on the outlook for inflation and interest rates in the United States, where the economic recovery is two years ahead of that in Europe.
With rates rising in the United States, the result has been to spread the inflationary psychology of the American markets to the European markets. Concern that the Federal Reserve might defend the dollar by raising rates only served to increase concerns about the direction of American rates and put more upward pressure on European bond yields.
"The globalization of capital markets appears to be playing a major role in the current behavior of long-term interest rates," said Stephen R. Waite, senior European economist at Merrill Lynch in London. "Our work has shown that in the 1990's there's been a very close correlation between movements in interest rates in the United States, Japan and Europe, despite the differences in the respective economic cycles."
In Germany, long-term interest rates, which are determined by the prices investors are willing to pay for bonds, are rising sharply, even as short-term rates, which are set by the Bundesbank, continue to decline. The yield on the benchmark 10-year government bond rose today to 7.33 percent from 7.17 percent on Friday. It has been rising most of the year.
Higher long-term rates, among other things, make it more expensive for companies to raise debt and for home buyers to get a mortgage.
"It's going to slow down this recovery quite appreciably," said Stephen Lewis, the research director at the London Bond Broking Company.
"The businessman in Munich and the prospective home buyer in Paris expected at the beginning of the year that interest rates would fall further from a level where they were already very low," Mr. Lewis said. "Instead, what has happened is that yields have reared up in a most alarming way with as yet no indication that the top has been reached."
Other economists said the recovery in Europe was not yet in any real danger. "All the surveys we've seen since the start of the turmoil indicate that business intentions to invest haven't been dampened and that consumer confidence has not turned down," Ian McCaffrey, an economist at NatWest Markets in London, said.
But most analysts agreed that unless there was a clear shift in market psychology, the economic consequences for Germany and its European neighbors could be substantial. The situation could be complicated if the dollar weakens further. Europe's recovery has been led by exports, and to the extent that a weak dollar makes goods sold in other currencies relatively more expensive, it could put a crimp in Europe's recovery.

HEADLINE: Critic's Notebook;
Orchestra League Peers Into Its Future

BYLINE: By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN 

DATELINE: DALLAS, June 17

 BODY:
"Celebrate Excellence," was the declaration on the banners and program books at the four-day national conference of the American Symphony Orchestra League here. And 1,700 representatives of 299 orchestras gathered to mourn its absence, chart its costs, debate its relevance and catalogue its virtues. These annual meetings have, in recent years, become a chronicle of a field in crisis, and this one was no exception.
Two years ago, the league -- the national organization serving orchestras -- presented a report documenting the causes of failing orchestras, offering explanations for dwindling audiences and drawing attention to increasing racial pressures against all-white orchestras in largely black cities. The statistics were sobering (though there are some who still disagree with the report's analyses and apocalyptic tone). Last year, a sweeping series of proposals were made in a study called "Americanizing the American Orchestra." That report became the most controversial document in the history of the orchestra. 
 It recommended a radical policy of affirmative action and urged the courting of younger audiences with pop, jazz, decorative lighting and interior design. The managers of the country's most important orchestras raised a formal objection to the ways the report was prepared and released, calling it "seriously flawed." Instead of finding ways for the orchestra to lead a changing population into the orchestral tradition, the managers thought the report was urging the orchestra to abandon that tradition to satisfy audience tastes. For many outside readers, including this critic, the report betrayed the league's mandate to preserve and serve the American orchestra.
So this year, in panels on labor negotiations and fund raising, on programming and marketing, the report and the issues it raised were on nearly everybody's mind. In one panel, "The Pursuit of Excellence," much energy was expended in an effort to define just what excellence is; Ernest Fleischman, the managing director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, urged that the panelists send their conclusions directly to the league officers who were leading the national service organization. The league, he implied, did not even know what was meant by the word; it was being invoked, he said, in order to "correct the impressions" left by last year's report.
Opening the conference on Thursday morning, Catherine French, the president of the league, also gave that impression, suggesting that while the report had "deeply disturbed" many of its readers, it had led to much debate and a renewed "commitment to excellence." Jane Alexander, the chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Arts, picked up the theme in her keynote address, adding lots of qualifications. "Orchestras should never compromise their artistic ambition," she suggested forthrightly, but excellence, she noted, is a "slippery concept." Orchestras must "challenge the audience to excellence," but should also have other goals in mind, supporting the "broader cultural agenda of this Administration."
A similar tension between excellence and other agendas was present throughout the conference. "Excellence" was often invoked while much more attention was on audience size and audience composition. Even music critics got into the act in a rather somber panel (in which I participated) led by Scott Cantrell, the president of the Music Critics Association of North America, which was meeting at the same time as the league. Each speaker compared the lot of music critics with the crises facing orchestras. My colleagues brought up incident after incident in which newspaper editors questioned the need to devote serious attention to classical music, citing decreased interest among readers.
For orchestras, this cultural shift and overly ambitious plans for large audiences have had profound effects, beginning with the failures of smaller American orchestras in the late 1980's -- including those in Oakland, New Orleans and Denver -- and continuing with a variety of crises today. Ms. French noted that orchestras in Tulsa and Louisville had asked for significant economic concessions from their players; the Florida Orchestra in Tampa has even missed its payroll. Many orchestras were still groping for a way to reshape themselves into leaner organizations serving smaller audiences.
In cities where the population is largely composed of minorities, political issues compound the economic problems and loom far larger than definitions of excellence. One orchestra manager complained about the director of a major foundation who boasted that his goal was "remaking cultural organizations," including orchestras. The president of the Dallas Symphony, Eugene Bonelli, said that the city of Dallas was attempting to cut back on its agreed-upon support for a new concert hall in order to direct more money toward social programs for minority groups.
Even Henry Fogel, the executive director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, who has characterized himself as a "supporter" of the league's report, pointed out, with some regret, that "There is no orchestra, from Omaha to our own, that is not finding that funding from government, foundations and corporate sources is restricted because we are seen as serving an upper-class and mostly white audience."
The result is widespread preoccupation with the issue. Stacy A. Cullison, the development director of the Des Moines Symphony, noted in one session that many of the orchestra's outreach programs into the minority community had been failures. One of her colleagues pointed out that since Des Moines had just a 10 percent minority population, perhaps the orchestra would be better off putting its energy into other areas.
But some orchestras were finding unusual ways to be true to their tradition and involve local communities. The St. Louis Symphony, for example, has established a "partnership progam" with black churches and has absorbed a local conservatory to become involved in arts education.
Christopher Wilkins, the music director of the San Antonio Symphony, which nearly folded in the 1980's, has an impressive long-term plan for involving the city's Hispanic population, which makes up 60 percent of the total. He programs orchestral music written by Latin American composers, has staged works by Falla and Mendelssohn using Spanish actors, and has recently begun commissioning orchestral works from Hispanic composers. Two Hispanic composers are in residence as part of a program the orchestra runs with the Meet the Composer organizationand a local arts center. They are writing symphonic music influenced by conjunto and tejano, varieties of Tex-Mex folk and pop styles.
Mr. Wilkins said the program has led to "massive increases in support from the city and business communities." Over time, it may also lead to unusual musical hybrids, and perhaps to new audiences. Or, it may not.
Given what Ms. Alexander called the "lack of a shared value system," it is impossible to see clearly where political and populist pressures will lead. A lot depends on the spin given to that catchword "excellence." During one session on "New Approaches to Concert Presentation," which was a demonstration of attempts to attract younger, more involved audiences, Ty Johnson, a producing associate of the Indianapolis Symphony, spoke of the need to constantly demand that "standards be kept very high." He provided an example on videotape: the orchestra's Christmas show, in which the orchestra played in the background as two actors in white bear suits led a row of tap-dancing, high-kicking Santas.
To each his own excellence.

HEADLINE: ON BASEBALL;
Of Princes, Paupers And Balance Afield

BYLINE: By Murray Chass 

 BODY:
Among other reasons, the owners want to impose a salary cap on their players in the name of competitive balance. Eighteen years ago Bowie Kuhn, then the commissioner, loudly issued management's dire warning that free agency would doom competitive balance.
What exactly is competitive balance? Does it mean parity, where every team is a .500 team and everyone suffers a severe case of boredom? Does it mean that one team doesn't dominate year after year the way the Yankees did from 1936 through 1964, when they won 22 pennants in 29 seasons? Or does it mean a circumstance where any team has a chance to win in any given season, as in the past 14 seasons, in which 23 of the 26 pre-expansion teams won division titles. 
 When he unveiled the clubs' salary cap proposal last week, Richard Ravitch noted that last year eight clubs had smaller gross revenues than the Toronto Blue Jays' payroll.
"If the system continues as it is today," the clubs' chief labor executive said, "you're going to see more and more clubs fall into that category and you'll see competitive balance worsen."
But one of those eight clubs Ravitch discussed was the Minnesota Twins, and they're always the one that undermines the argument the owners are making this year. Despite the size of their market and the size of their payroll, the Twins always create their own competitive balance.
They're doing it again this season, and don't the Yankees know it. The Twins came to Yankee Stadium last night for their first game with the Yankees since they ended a 10-game winning streak for the American League East leaders, beat them twice in a two-game series and started them on the slide in which they have lost 17 of 31 games.
These Twins were not supposed to upset the competitive-balance argument this season. They started with an 8-16 record, and that was supposed to be the course their season would take. But they got as close to one game from first in the A.L. Central last week, and they have indicated they could be a legitimate contender until the end of the season or the start of the strike, whichever comes first.
These Twins are 21st in the payroll standing, according to information provided by the Player Relations Committee. That position, though, has not stopped them from standing near the top of the won-lost standing.
The Yankees are third on the payroll list. They are generally near the top. Just as the Twins undermine the competitive-balance argument in their way, the Yankees do it, too. They are Exhibit A of the argument that no correlation necessarily exists between a high payroll and a high spot in the won-lost standing.
From 1982 through last season, a 12-year span, the Yankees had the major leagues' highest average salary four times and were in the top four five other times. They did not win a division championship in that period.
The Twins, on the other hand, cracked the top 10 only once and were in the bottom 10 six times, and they won the World Series twice in a five-year stretch during that period.
The Twins represent one-half of a two-part axiom that holds true in baseball, as well as any other business: Good management overcomes all sorts of problems; poor management undermines all sorts of positives.
In General Manager Andy MacPhail, the Twins have good management. But they also have an owner who allows MacPhail to make baseball decisions, tempered only by their impact on the club's economics. Working under the constraints of their revenue, which is considerably less than the Yankees', MacPhail manages to build a winner not every year but often enough to make the Twins a successful franchise.
One of MacPhail's strengths is his belief in stability in the dugout. Tom Kelly has been the only manager MacPhail has had in his eight years as general manager. But while the Twins have had one general manager and one manager for eight years, the Yankees, the other half of that axiom, have had six or seven general managers, depending on certain technicalities, and seven managers.
MacPhail refused yesterday to take any credit for the Twins' development into a contender this season. He gives all of the credit to Kelly and the players. The development, he said, was so unexpected that the fans haven't caught on.
"As good as we've played, our attendance is down," MacPhail said. "We're suffering a hangover from the people who didn't think we had a flying chance, and they have their interest elsewhere."
The team's plight reinforces the fear MacPhail said he has for teams in the Twins' circumstances. "In my own mind, I don't think it can go on," he said. "I am a big proponent that you have to have some sort of different economic scheme."
But if the Twins were to win their division championship, wouldn't they at least set back the competitive-balance argument as they have in recent years?
"Sure," said MacPhail, honest and candid as always.

HEADLINE: The Carter Opening

 BODY:
Granted, it was not a masterpiece of clarity and coordination. But former President Jimmy Carter and the Clinton Administration, which approved his trip, appear to have moved the crisis over the North Korean nuclear program back toward the negotiating table. Mr. Carter's personal diplomacy, conducted with North Korea's President, Kim Il Sung, may well provide a face-saving way for both sides to pull back from confrontation.
Mr. Carter says he won Mr. Kim's consent to freeze his nuclear program in a verifiable way while high-level talks are resumed between the United States and North Korea to resolve the nuclear issue. If the specifics of the Korean offer are confirmed, it offers a promising route toward a deal. 
 The former President also won Mr. Kim's assent to a meeting with South Korea's President, an offer that the South has welcomed. If the talks take place, they could further defuse the crisis on the Korean Peninsula.
True, Mr. Carter erred in saying that the U.S. would suspend efforts to seek United Nations endorsement of sanctions; President Clinton had conditioned that suspension on confirmation by North Korea of its nuclear freeze.
But sanctions would be difficult to mount effectively at this point anyway. Japan and South Korea, never mind China and Russia, are unlikely to move to sanctions while there is a chance for diplomacy. Tough sanctions could bring down Japan's coalition Government and raise risks of war that South Korea does not care to run.
The promises Mr. Carter says he has won from North Korea would go a long way toward meeting conditions set by the Administration for holding high-level talks with the North.
One condition has necessarily been abandoned. North Korea's abrupt removal of fuel rods from its reactor at Yongbyon barred international inspectors from their preferred way of determining whether the North diverted enough spent nuclear fuel in 1989 to yield a bomb's worth or more of plutonium. So other ways must now be found, a major issue for the high-level talks.
But an even more important condition was met when President Kim gave Mr. Carter his personal pledge that the inspectors could remain at Yongbyon, thus preventing diversion of an additional five bombs' worth of plutonium. In the meantime, North Korea needs to defer loading the reactor with new fuel rods that could be available for future diversion, an issue that Mr. Carter did not raise with the North.
Once Washington confirms that a freeze is in effect, high-level talks can resume and preparations for economic sanctions can halt. The U.S. will then seek a verifiable end to the North's nuclear program, especially its capacity for reprocessing spent fuel, and an end to the North's missile exports.
Pyongyang, in turn, is seeking a peace treaty formally ending the Korean War and establishing diplomatic ties with Washington. It also wants the world to give it a less proliferation-prone reactor to replace its current reactor, a potentially promising investment from a security standpoint.
Mr. Carter was probably premature in declaring the Korean nuclear crisis over, but his intervention may have usefully pointed the way toward its eventual resolution.

Fresh Air for America

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
In Washington, some members of Congress have decided to remain faithful to themselves, their concept of what America means and their special constituency. They bring fresh air to America.
For no political gain and at some risk, they have chosen to be constant to the hounded and battered constituency they selected for themselves -- the prisoners in the torture cells of China and Tibet and all the other political and religious victims of Beijing. 
 At first there were four Democratic members of Congress. They introduced legislation to override President Clinton's own personal decision. That, of course, was to renege on his promise to use tariff pressure on Beijing to ease repression of dissidents, priests and workers.
Then, within hours, 40 more members, both parties, signed up and the list grows. They know they are taking on the power of the Presidency, party politics and the rich and very tough China lobby.
Under the legislation the U.S. would remove the low tariff privileges for all products of China's most varied and strongest economic conglomerate -- the army. Through scores of dummy corporations, the Chinese Army uses soldiers, "volunteers" and particularly low-cost labor to make and export products ranging from toys to assault rifles.
The legislation would also remove low-tariff privileges from specified products of state-owned enterprises -- among them plastics, wood articles, footwear, apparel. All told, the tariff hikes would affect the costs of only $5 billion of China's $40 billion exports to the U.S.
Still, and whether they succeed or not, these politicians are opening windows to some refreshing reminders of American idealism.
We need it. Not only has Mr. Clinton broken his human rights promises on China but Jimmy Carter, strong for human rights during his Presidency, astonishingly soils his mission to North Korea by some of the warmest praise of a dictator since the American adoration of Uncle Joe Stalin. Has Mr. Carter changed?
Beijing has not, not at all. So Mr. Clinton's surrender to the Chinese Government was notice that the Administration was canceling human rights as an effective part of American policy.
Now members of Congress are crying stop -- the U.S. must return to human rights as one instrument and goal of policy.
The human rights concept simply is that liberty is not just the struggle of those who do not have it but also of those who live within its grace. It was a reason America's name was blessed around the world.
On his human rights record, President Clinton encourages what the country needs least: cynicism. He was elected because enough Americans saw him as an open-hearted democratic idealist, the antithesis of life as a bottom line.
So one message of the legislation is particularly important. The politicians are saying that cynicism need not be the country's soul-destroying destiny. Fresh air; lovely.
On economics, the sponsors of the legislation open other windows by dissecting the fraudulent argument that the U.S. cannot afford a human rights policy in China.
China, they point out, racks up a $31 billion sales advantage over the U.S. The Communists did not accomplish that through brilliant new managerial methods but through imposed low wages and banning of unions. Working conditions are so bad that police are busy putting down strikes. How many workers have been killed?
Low wages in China may improve the balance sheet of some U.S. companies, relatively few. But tens of thousands of American workers stand to lose their jobs. They are unable to compete with Chinese wages and hours -- thank God.
Written with respect, the names of the original sponsors of the legislation are: in the Senate, George Mitchell, the majority leader; and in the House, the majority leader, Richard A. Gephardt; David E. Bonior, the majority whip, and Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco, a strong, steady leader for human rights.
In Congress or out, the human rights movement does not ask the U.S. to dispatch arms or armies but to use economics and diplomacy to pressure dictatorships into allowing some elemental civil decencies.
The sponsors of the legislation are putting a question to Americans: If America cannot do that much for the rights of humans, then what are we, to the world and ourselves?

HEADLINE: NEW YORK CITY'S BUDGET: THE OVERVIEW;
GIULIANI'S BUDGET WINS THE SUPPORT OF COUNCIL CHIEFS

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the leaders of the City Council agreed yesterday on a $31.6 billion budget that would sharply curtail the growth in spending for the first time since the city fiscal crisis of the 1970's and begin to wrench down the size of New York City's government.
The Mayor and the Council leaders struck a tentative deal at 3:30 yesterday morning -- toasting it with champagne -- after two weeks of talks and a final day and night of haggling about what spending to cut and whether to merge the city's three police forces, which in the end was given the green light by the Council. 
 It then took 17 hours for Mr. Giuliani and the Council's Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, to announce a formal agreement on the budget as the leaders presented the details to restive Democrats on the Council, many of whom were angered by parts of the deal and the public announcement of the accord by the Mayor's office before they learned of it themselves.
Appearing with Council members in the rotunda of City Hall late last night, Mr. Giuliani said the budget sent a "strong signal" that the city could straighten out its financial affairs and start to turn around its economy.
"This is a budget that will very, very much help the economy of New York City continue the recovery that is under way," the Mayor said.
For his part, Mr. Vallone said that the Council had preserved at least some vital services from the Mayor's budgetary ax, but he acknowledged that it had little room to maneuver due to the city's feeble fiscal state.
The Council's 51 members must still vote on whether to adopt the agreement, but the Speaker and his aides said they had enough votes to pass it as soon as today, despite discontent from liberals and some black and Hispanic members.
"Not everything that we wanted was in this budget," Mr. Vallone said. "It couldn't be in this budget."
In broad strokes, the agreement preserved Mr. Giuliani's priorities: closing a budget gap of $2.3 billion for the fiscal year that begins on July 1, protecting the Police Department, slashing more than $1 billion in services, cutting the work force and modestly cutting taxes on hotel rooms and commercial rents.
Under the agreement, the Council members succeeded in restoring about $75 million in services cut by Mr. Giuliani -- only two-tenths of 1 percent of the whole budget. The restorations ranged from programs for young people to weekly recycling pickups in Manhattan, Brooklyn and the Bronx.
And for every dollar put back, Council leaders agreed to cut spending elsewhere, including a token $12 million cut in administrative costs for the Police Department, which Mr. Giuliani had declared all but untouchable.
"We had to take our cuts and take it in stride," Councilwoman Priscilla Wooten of Brooklyn said.
The Council also reallocated $111 million in capital projects that the Mayor's senior aide had decried as "pork" only four days ago but again matched restorations with alternative cuts. The largest restoration was a new police academy in the Bronx, with the Council allotting $11 million in design costs after Mr. Giuliani had abandoned the proposal altogether.
 
Test of Strength
 The budget represented the first real test of strength between the city's first Republican mayor since the early 1970's and the Council, which still has a majority of 44 Democrats.
But with a projected budget gap of $2.3 billion and most of the Council's Democrats unwilling to raise taxes, Mr. Giuliani succeeded in pushing the major parts of his budget.
The budget agreement included modest cuts in taxes for businesses this year and deeper reductions down the road. It cut the size of the work force paid with city tax dollars by 15,000 jobs, to 201,000, the fewest since 1985. And it held spending by the Mayor's count at $31.6 billion, $100 million less than the current fiscal year, which Mr. Giuliani has said would mark the first time a city budget has shrunk in 16 years.
Other city officials said that the figure was largely symbolic, but even their count produced only a fractional increase in spending, far smaller than the growth from year to year between any recent budgets. They said the Mayor's office had undercounted at least $140 million in Federal aid that would push spending slightly higher than this year. The city's spending, which the Mayor's office directly controls as opposed to Federal and state funds, actually increases by $254 million, to $22 billion.
 
Measured Praise
 Fiscal monitors offered measured praise for the tentative agreement. Allen J. Proctor, executive director of the state's Financial Control Board, said the agreement made "very, very important progress" toward restoring stability to the city's finances, although about $700 million of the budget remained at risk.
"There's a lot of ifs, ands and buts," he said, "but it's a major change."
Even with an agreement, the Speaker still has to push the budget through the full Council, which is expected to be done sometime in the next day or so. An aide to one member complained that the Council's negotiators had won little from the Mayor, saying, "There's nothing bold here."
Councilwoman Annette M. Robinson of Brooklyn, one of 21 members of the Council's black and Hispanic caucus, said the Mayor's austerity hurt neighborhoods like hers in Bedford-Stuyvesant. "This is a bad-news budget," she said. "It reflects the priorities of this administration, and I am deeply dissatisfied."
 
Priorities Accepted
 In fact, despite the differences in political party, the Council's leadership essentially accepted the priorities laid out in the Mayor's financial plan in February and in the executive budget in May -- a smaller government with less spending, leaner services, fewer municipal workers and no new taxes.
To close the projected gap between revenues and spending, the Mayor's budget cut spending by a total of $1.2 billion in virtually every city agency except the Police and Fire Departments.
The rest of the gap would be closed through a variety of steps, including saving $200 million in contributions to workers' health benefits and at least $560 million in state and Federal aid, including $75 million the Council won in a commitment from the state's ranking members of Congress, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Representative Charles B. Rangel.
Over the last two weeks of budget talks, the most vehement confrontations have swirled around the Council's attempts to restore less than $100 million worth of spending in agencies or programs, as well as more in capital projects, that are dear to members' constituencies.
One area that proved particularly contentious was spending for the Board of Education. The city's share of the board's $7.5 billion budget grew slightly from the current fiscal year, but was $358 million less than Schools Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines had asked for.
In the end, though, the Council restored no new funds for the public schools. The budget did include $115 million in new aid, earmarked for specific programs, included in the state budget approved early this month, and a $36 million surplus from the board's current budget.
The Council's leaders left the fate of more of the school board's financing to Albany, where the Assembly and the Senate have passed a measure that would require the Mayor's office to spend an estimated $75 million more on schools. That bill appears to have stalled, however, with the Republicans who control the Senate not moving it on to the Governor for a signature.
 
A Critical Statement
 Mr. Cortines released a critical statement yesterday, saying the budget was "ultimately harmful" for the city's public schools. "It will continue the pattern of neglect that has come to be a hallmark of this system," he said.
At more than one point, the talks between the Mayor and the Council's negotiators broke down over the total amount of spending the Council wanted to restore. When the Council proposed adding new spending on capital projects under the members' discretion, the Mayor's chief aide, Deputy Mayor Peter J. Powers, lambasted the spending as "pork" and said the Council lacked "the vision you have to achieve" to control spending.
Although some Council members, joined by elected officials and fiscal monitors, pressed the Mayor to extract significant savings from the Police Department, the Council finally bowed to Mr. Giuliani's steadfast refusal to cut the department more than symbolically. The Council's leaders settled for the modest cut in administrative spending in the Police Department, as well as $1.2 million in spending in the Fire Department.
The Council mounted a stiffer challenge to the Mayor's proposal to merge the Police Department with the housing and transit police forces. Some members complained that the merger would jeopardize the number of officers on patrol in the city's housing projects and the subways.
The Council cleared the way for the merger to move ahead, but attached to the budget agreement a "condition" that would give the Council some say as the proposal moves forward and would require the Mayor to maintain "policing," though not specific levels of officers.
The merger would allow the Mayor's office to consolidate about 400 jobs financed by the city. The Council used those 400 positions, together with others, to restore a total of 720 jobs in the Department of Social Services.
The budget agreement also dropped the Mayor's proposal to consolidate the Taxi and Limousine Commission into the Police Department and to sell the commercial license of WNYC-FM, a city radio station.

HEADLINE: NEW YORK CITY'S BUDGET: NEWS ANALYSIS;
Surprisingly, No Gridlock

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

 BODY:
Rudolph W. Giuliani edged into office last November to become a Republican Mayor surrounded by Democrats, a political alignment in City Hall that seemed like a formula for municipal gridlock.
But the first major test between the parties -- the battle over Mr. Giuliani's austere budget -- barely rose to the level of a confrontation, as the leaders of the Democratic-controlled City Council agreed to a $31.6 billion plan so similar to Mr. Giuliani's original proposal that the Mayor could fairly say it represented the break he had promised with New York's tradition of expansive government. 
 Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone spent all day yesterday selling the deal to Democrats, who expressed anger and resignation at the results. But shortly after 10 P.M., with enough votes in hand, Mr. Vallone stood with a dozen Council members at the Mayor's side and spoke of achieving a "good government budget, a budget within our financial resources."
Why a Council that had once fought so bitterly with Mr. Giuliani's Democratic predecessor bowed so easily to the new Mayor is a complex tale of politics and fiscal policy. It begins with the climate created by the elections of the Republican Mayor and a Republican Governor in New Jersey. It ends with the fiscal constraints imposed by a $2.3 billion deficit, an overwhelming problem that left only hard, unpalatable choices.
But it is also the story of a Mayor who had a clear, well-articulated Republican vision of smaller government, and a Council that made no attempt to forge a broad Democratic alternative, its members ranging across an ideological spectrum and more concerned with parochial, neighborhood interests.
Above all, the city's dire financial straits dominated the budget negotiations, making them an exercise in apportioning pain. "Giuliani isn't the enemy," said one of the Council's negotiators. "The enemy is the $2.3 billion hole."
But Mr. Giuliani governed as if he had won election by a landslide rather than by 3 percentage points, and he skillfully seized on the deficit to further his own agenda to scale back the mission of government and the tax burden.
He made his first move a month before entering office, when a panel that had been appointed by his predecessor, David N. Dinkins, reported that the city was nearing a "fiscal collision" and outlined a menu of drastic measures that officials could use to balance the budget, including several new fees, tolls and increases in sales and property taxes.
 
'Old Thinking'
 Surprising the city's fiscal establishment, Mr. Giuliani, however, promptly dismissed the report as "old thinking" because of its inclusion of taxes and fees. In February he released a fiscal plan that did what the experts had said would be too drastic and jarring -- closing part of the deficit through $1 billion in reductions in services and the departure of city workers.
Once Mr. Giuliani ruled out additional taxes and fees, which would have allowed more services to be maintained, only several municipal unions and advocacy groups broached the subject again.
The fiscal monitors were clearly on Mr. Giuliani's side. If Council members doubted the anti-tax mood, they could look not so much to the election of Mr. Giuliani, whose main campaign issue was crime, but to the defeat of Jim Florio, the Democratic Governor of New Jersey, with voters citing taxes as their primary reason for electing a Republican, Christine Todd Whitman.
 
Severance Packages
 Mr. Giuliani took a second step that boxed in the Council when he won both the support of the municipal unions and the Municipal Assistance Corporation to use severance packages to lure 7,000 workers off the payroll immediately.
To get permission to use a $200 million city surplus that the assistance corporation controlled to pay the workers, he made a binding pledge to cut 15,000 employees from the city work force by the end of next year, a pledge that confounded Council negotiators when they tried to restore money for city services important to their members but without increasing the size of the work force.
But if the Council had few options, it made no attempt to become the voice of opposition, to create a broad message to counter Mr. Giuliani's crusade against bureaucratic bloat.
Manhattan Borough President Ruth W. Messinger and Public Advocate Mark Green accused Mr. Giuliani of Reaganomics, and spoke of core services needed for a functioning city. But the Council splintered, with conservative Democrats like Speaker Vallone largely supporting Mr. Giuliani's priorities, and liberals and members of the black and Hispanic caucus denouncing the Mayor for failing minorities and the poor.
The result was a cacophony instead of a message that could seize and mobilize the public. "You have a Republican mayor who -- you can quarrel about whether they make sense or not -- has some bedrock principles," said Raymond D. Horton, president of the Citizens Budget Commission. "I'm not sure what the principles are that hold the New York Democratic party together anymore."
So the negotiations focused mostly on the margins, much as they had when Mr. Dinkins was Mayor and the Council was just learning how to use the powers granted to it by the City Charter. The Council ultimately won a small number of restorations, $75 million in areas like youth services, parks, libraries and recycling -- two-tenths of one percent of the total budget. And Democrats won only a $12 million cut from the police budget.
It was not much, but most Democratic opposition dissolved -- most notably from members of the black and Hispanic caucus, who had been vocal in their objections to the Mayor's priorities, some of them assuring union leaders in public as late as Monday night that they were going to fight. Councilwoman Priscilla A. Wooten, the caucus head, even joined Mr. Vallone and Mr. Giuliani at their press conference. "We've come a long way," she told reporters. "Yes, I will vote for the budget."
It now remains to be seen how New Yorkers respond to the service cuts that the budget will put in place, and whether the year ahead will bring a groundswell of opposition to Mr. Giuliani's vision of a leaner government. How long will the lines be in welfare offices or in the Parking Violations Bureau, which has already shortened its hours? Will child welfare workers fail to detect cases of child abuse? How will New Yorkers respond to dirtier parks and slowdowns in subway station repairs?
"I'm interested in the next 12 months and how bad this budget may end up in terms of services," said Councilman Stephen DiBrienza, a Brooklyn Democrat. "That's where you'll see reality hitting."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY TRADERS PUSH THE DOLLAR BENEATH 100 YEN

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 21

 BODY:
The dollar fell below 100 Japanese yen today for the first time in the post-World War II history of currency trading.
The fact that the dollar broke through the psychological barrier of 100 yen after taking a battering on Monday against the German mark is both economically troubling and politically embarrassing for the Clinton Administration. No President likes to preside over the fall of the dollar to record lows. 
 Whether Mr. Clinton's policies are responsible or not, currency traders say the dollar's decline sends a signal of weakness about both the Administration and the nation as a whole. It also leaves the Clinton Administration -- and the Federal Reserve -- in a tough bind with no good options. To allow the American currency to continue to fall in value would be inflationary, since it makes imports more expensive.
The Treasury Department, either working alone or with other nations, could intervene to buy dollars and try to prop up the currency that way, and most likely it will. But trying to change the market's direction through intervention is only a short-term solution. The United States tried that strategy on May 4, with 16 central banks buying dollars in concert, and while the dollar rose modestly, the gains clearly did not last.
The long-term option would be for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates to make dollar-denominated bonds and other investments more attractive to foreign investors. That would draw dollars back into the United States and halt the slide. But that approach runs the risk of choking the rebound in the American economy that has been fueled by low interest rates. It also would erode the value of bonds, which have fixed interest rates.
Today's dollar selloff began after the Government reported that the nation's trade deficit widened 22 percent in April. The prices of stocks and bonds followed the dollar down. [Pages D8, D16.]
In the first decades after World War II, more than 300 yen was required to buy a dollar, but in the early 1970's as the global system of fixed exchange rates collapsed, the yen-per-dollar figure began a long descent. The number has not been above 200 yen since January 1986.
Whatever the Clinton Administration and the Federal Reserve intend to do, they have kept it to themselves for now.
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, could signal something about the Fed's intentions on Wednesday when he testifies before the House Budget Committee.
Several currency traders said the fact that the Administration did not seem to be acting as the dollar slowly eroded during the last 10 days added to their uncertainty and contributed to today's selloff.
"The Administration has been strangely silent," said John Lipsky, the chief economist at Salomon Brothers. "Market participants are wondering whether they are just keeping their powder dry, waiting to intervene at the moment of greatest impact, or whether they have changed their minds about that policy and no longer see a need to defend the currency. Or maybe there is some misunderstanding. Either way, at this point the story is less one about economic fundamentals and more one about uncertainty."
The dollar first broke through its previous record low, of 100.35 yen, in midday trading today in New York, and then dipped below 100 yen shortly after that, the first time since the war's end that one cent was worth less than one yen. But after touching a low of 99.90 yen at about 12:18 P.M., Eastern daylight time, the dollar closed in New York trading at 100.30 yen, down 1.65 yen from the close on Monday. The dollar was also under pressure against the German mark, falling to 1.5960 marks in New York, from 1.5995 on Monday.
Currency traders say the day went like this: In the morning the Commerce Department reported the trade figures. The gap between American exports and imports swelled 22 percent in April, to $8.4 billion. Exports fell 3.3 percent, to $56.18 billion, while imports fell only six-tenths of 1 percent, to $64.58 billion, driving the deficit up.
By nation, the largest American deficit was, as usual, with Japan, although the April gap, at $5.48 billion, narrowed slightly from March.
Most currency traders waited on the sidelines to see how the Clinton Administration and the Federal Reserve might react to the report. While they waited, there were a few very large sales of dollars and in that relatively thin market these sales pushed the dollar to a record low. Rumors of some small buying by central banks then drove it back slightly above 100.
 
Improving Economies Abroad
 Market analysts and currency traders cited several explanations for the dollar's slide. The first lies in the mounting indications that both Japan and Germany are now firmly out of recession and on the rise economically, meaning that the declines in interest rates in those countries are likely to be halted or even reversed.
The higher that German and Japanese interest rates go, and the greater the growth of their economies, the more investors want to keep their money in those countries, to take advantage of the higher rates and the greater growth.
Hans Tietmeyer, head of the Bundesbank, said in a speech today that the German central bank "can't live" with inflation at an annual rate of 3 percent. The statement was widely viewed as a signal to the market that Germany will not be lowering interest rates any longer.
In addition, the Japanese Government reported today that Japan's economy grew at an unexpectedly strong annualized rate of 3.9 percent in the first quarter of this year, providing new evidence that the long slump there is finally fading.
Another element cited by some traders is the political malaise in Washington these days and particularly the uncertainty about the Clinton Presidency -- both the President's continued personal legal problems and the growing feeling that Mr. Clinton may not get the centerpiece of his domestic program, an overhaul of health care, through Congress this year.
 
A New Theory
 But one new explanation being heard from some currency traders is that the dollar is suffering from being too popular. In the last two years, two things have happened to affect the dollar: low interest rates have made it very easy to borrow dollars and invest them around the world and the fall of Communism has opened economies for dollar investing that were never opened before -- from Eastern Europe to Russia to China.
Last year there was a net outflow of $250 billion from the United States, when the trade deficit, transfer payments and capital investments were added together. Factor in a decade of American budget deficits, financed in part by foreigners buying United States Treasury notes and bonds, and it adds up to a lot of dollars overseas. This supply, some traders said, is eroding some of the value of the American currency.
"Never before has the world been awash with so many dollars," said Gerald Celente, director of the Trends Research Institute, a group of market forecasters. "China is dealing with dollars. Russia is dealing with dollars. The high-flying Pacific Rim economies are dealing with dollars. So countries worldwide have been fueling their economies with cheap dollars. In a lot of them, where there is high inflation, everyone is putting their wealth into dollars. So we have a flood of dollars now on the global market, and that naturally drives down the price."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar's Slide Against Yen Marked by Orderly Trading

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
The dollar fell to a new post-World War II low against the Japanese yen yesterday, continuing a slide that has lopped off 5 percent of its value in a little more than two weeks. The dollar briefly traded below 100 yen for the first time.
Traders said yesterday's drop was orderly and was nothing like the speculative fever that gripped the currency market in early May, when the Federal Reserve Bank and other central banks intervened to support the dollar. Indeed, there were no signs that the Fed or other central banks were buying dollars yesterday. 
 But traders said a new round of intervention by the Fed and other central banks was soon likely.
"I think they will intervene on Wednesday," said Robert A. White, senior vice president and manager of foreign exchange at Standard Chartered Bank. "But I question how effective it will be."
While intervention to support the dollar would reaffirm the Administration's policy of not allowing the dollar to slide against the yen, analysts said that at this point the Fed was likely to step in mainly to try to arrest the recent slide in stock and bond prices.
 
Lack of Confidence
 "By itself, the weakness of the dollar is not necessarily of concern," said John P. Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers. "It is the combination of the weak bond market and the decline in the stock market that suggests a lack of investor confidence both here and abroad. That is a message policy makers will ignore at their peril."
 In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted at 100.30 yen, down 1.65 yen from 101.95 yen on Monday. It had traded as low as 99.90 yen shortly after noon.
The dollar's late New York quote was below its previous record postwar low of 100.35 yen on Aug. 17, 1993.
The dollar also weakened against the German mark. It was quoted late yesterday at 1.5960 marks, down from 1.5995 marks on Monday.
The dollar fell sharply against the German currency on Monday and Friday as investors shifted money from chaotic American stock and bond markets into mark-denominated investments.
Germany has higher interest rates than the United States and thus offers better returns to investors.
Elsewhere in late New York trading, the British pound was stronger at $1.5453, up from $1.5370 on Monday.
If the Fed and other central banks intervene to support the dollar, currency traders question what it would accomplish. "It is not clear that intervention at these levels would be as effective as it was in May, because it appears the selling that has taken place over the last couple of days hasn't been purely speculative, " said Richard E. Witten, a partner at Goldman, Sachs & Company.
"The selling of dollars and buying of yen seems to reflect a rebalancing of portfolios," he said. "You could argue that people are selling dollars because they don't want to be in U.S. markets and are looking for better returns elsewhere. And the only big equity market that is not suffering from a bear market syndrome right now is Japan's."

HEADLINE: Clinton Offers North Korea A Chance to Resume Talks

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 21

 BODY:
Trying to build on former President Jimmy Carter's recent trip to North Korea, the Clinton Administration has sent a letter to the North proposing to resume high-level talks and offering to suspend its push for economic sanctions once talks are under way.
In the letter, sent on Monday, Robert L. Gallucci, Assistant Secretary of State for Politico-Military Affairs, said the Administration would resume talks soon if the North Koreans took steps to confirm that they were willing to freeze their nuclear program, as Mr. Carter reported. 
 North Korea has yet to respond to the letter, which was sent to Deputy Foreign Minister Kang Sok Ju. But in a promising sign, North Korea extended the visas of the international monitors at its Yongbyon nuclear complex.
"We expect and hope to hear back within a couple of days about whether President Carter's understanding of what they said is correct," President Clinton told reporters today.
 
Two Different Cards to Play
 Mr. Carter's talks last week in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, have been seen as both a foreign policy opportunity and a potential political liability.
Hoping to avoid a confrontation with North Korea, the White House has sought to exploit any openings. At the same time, many officials remain wary of North Korea, and the White House has pointedly declined to embrace Mr. Carter's assessment that the crisis is over.
Reflecting this caution, senior officials said that if high-level talks were agreed upon, Washington wanted to hold them soon to gauge the North's intentions. One senior official said Washington was proposing a date in early July.
In an effort to insulate themselves against criticism that they are soft on North Korea, Administration officials insist that Washington is continuing consultations over economic sanctions. But officials emphasized today that they would suspend the push for sanctions if talks were resumed.
 
Reluctant Allies
 "If we get the kind of confirmation that I've outlined" and talks are resumed, Secretary of State Warren Christopher told reporters today, "it's clear that sanctions would have to be held in abeyance at that time."
In a sense, however, the Administration is just stating the obvious. Even before Mr. Carter's trip, China, Japan, Russia and other countries expressed reluctance about tough economic sanctions. And by striking conciliatory themes with Mr. Carter, North Korea's leaders have undercut the Administration's effort to mobilize support for sanctions.
The Administration also needed to bring its sanctions policy into line with its more conciliatory approach. The Administration initially proposed sanctions to punish North Korea for destroying evidence of its past production of plutonium. But in response to Mr. Carter's diplomacy, the Administration has deferred the issue of past plutonium production, noting that it would not raise the subject until high-level talks were under way.
Washington wants North Korea to do three things now: agree not to reprocess additional plutonium, allow international inspectors to remain and refrain from refueling its nuclear reactor at Yongbyon.
 
A Call for Reinforcements
 Senator John R. McCain, Republican of Arizona, who met recently with United States military officials in South Korea, told reporters today that he supported Washington's efforts to explore the possible openings from the Carter diplomacy.
But Senator McCain argued that Washington needed to reinforce its forces in South Korea, both to deter a North Korean attack and to strengthen its ability to launch a pre-emptive nuclear attack in case diplomatic efforts and sanctions failed to persuade North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program.
The Senator said it would take the United States a week to silence the North Korean artillery within range of Seoul and other key South Korean targets, using the military forces the United States now has in the area.
But Pentagon officials say the Administration is delaying deployment of reinforcements while it tries to determine whether North Korea is willing to talk.

Talks on Korean Summit Set
 TOKYO, Wednesday, June 22 (Special to The New York Times) -- North Korea announced today that it would agree to South Korea's proposal for a meeting to decide when the presidents of the two countries would hold an historic first summit meeting.
Representatives from the North and South will meet next Tuesday at the border village of Panmonjom, the head of the North's administration council, Kang Song San, said in a statement. On Tuesday, a Japanese group that recently visited North Korea's president, Kim Il Sung, said he was hoping to meet his South Korean counterpart, Kim Young Sam, on Aug. 15. That is a national day of celebration in Korea, the anniversary of the peninsula's liberation from Japanese rule in 1945.

HEADLINE: An Airman's Revenge: 5 Minutes of Terror

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SPOKANE, Wash., June 21

 BODY:
The gunman who killed 4 people and wounded 23 at an Air Force hospital near here on Monday was apparently motivated by a desire for revenge against the first two people he shot, both fatally: a psychiatrist and a psychologist whose observation of him ultimately led to his discharge from the service last month.
The gunman, who was shot to death by a military policeman while pursuing yet another would-be victim in the parking lot outside the hospital, was identified today as Dean A. Mellberg, a 20-year-old former airman from Lansing, Mich. 
 Mr. Mellberg, dressed in black, was armed with a Chinese-made MAK-90 assault rifle when he arrived by taxicab Monday afternoon at the hospital, which lies just outside the wire-and-steel-protected perimeter of Fairchild Air Force Base, 10 miles west of Spokane.
 
'Knew Where He Was Going'
 According to a reconstruction of events offered by the authorities today, Mr. Mellberg went first to a restroom inside the hospital's annex building, where he removed the rifle from a duffel bag that he had carried with him from his motel room in Spokane. He then walked to an office shared by the psychiatrist, Maj. Thomas Brigham, 31, and the psychologist, Capt. Alan London, 40, and killed both of them with two bursts of gunfire.
"He knew where he was going," John Goldman, a Spokane County undersheriff, said of the gunman. "He went directly to that office."
From there, Mr. Mellberg strode down the corridors of the annex and sprayed them with round after round as panic-stricken patients and medical personnel ran for their lives. He then entered the adjoining main building of the hospital and shot up the cafeteria there.
The indiscriminate nature of the gunfire that followed the killing of Major Brigham and Captain London was underscored when the authorities identified one of the dead as an 8-year-old girl, Christine McCaren, who was shot inside the cafeteria. In addition, the wounded included a 5-year-old girl and a 4-year-old boy, who was among the seven victims listed in critical condition today.
After five minutes or so inside the annex and the main building, Mr. Mellberg walked out and entered the parking lot, where he killed Anita Linder, the 62-year-old wife of a retired serviceman. He then spotted a fleeing man and was chasing him around a parked car when the military police officer, patrolling on his bicycle, arrived at the scene, drew his service revolver and killed the gunman with two shots to the head.
 
Trouble In His Past
 Military officials said today that they were still drawing together Mr. Mellberg's service records and could not yet speak in detail about the psychiatric problems that they said brought about his discharge last month. But this rough sketch of the gunman emerged, partly from what the officials were willing to confirm:
Airman Mellberg arrived at Fairchild Air Force Base in April 1993 for assignment as an aircraft maintenance technician and later became a subject of complaints by his roommate.
Without elaborating, Col. William Brooks, the base commander, said these complaints had involved Airman Mellberg's unusual behavior. But in an interview with The Seattle Times, the gunman's mother, Lois Mellberg of Lansing, said the trouble had begun with harassment inflicted on her son by other airmen at the base, including their planting rumors that he was a homosexual.
Whatever the case, Airman Mellberg, after observation by Major Brigham and Captain London, spent several months starting last September shuttling between Fairchild and Wilford Hall, an Air Force psychiatric evaluation center in San Antonio. The nature of the findings there are not clear, but in March, apparently having been cleared for duty, he was transferred to Cannon Air Force Base in New Mexico to resume his career as an aircraft technician. He was still at Cannon when he was discharged in May.
 
Return to Spokane
 Investigators said today that Mr. Mellberg arrived back in the Spokane area last Wednesday, checked into an economy-rate motel in the city and then made contact with Michael Carroll, a 32-year-old federally licensed gun dealer who sells weapons out of his home across the street from a Spokane high school.
Mr. Mellberg subsequently bought the MAK-90, a modified version of the popular AK-47 assault rifle, for about $400 from Mr. Carroll, who also works as a freelance political cartoonist and is the creator of several published cartoons poking fun at gun control advocates.
Mr. Mellberg's purchase of the assault rifle was apparently entirely legal, as was his purchase of the 70-round cylinder clip that fed the weapon. The authorities said Mr. Mellberg had bought the clip from another licensed gun dealer, whose identity was not disclosed.
Jim Anderson, the manager of the Spokane motel where Mr. Mellberg had been staying in recent days, described him as "clean-cut and well behaved." But, Mr. Anderson said, the maid who cleaned Mr. Mellberg's room after he left for the clinic on Monday afternoon found a large knife hidden under a pillow.

HEADLINE: Clinton Panel Urges Blocking Haitians' Bank Accounts

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 21

 BODY:
The United States is moving forward to tighten economic sanctions against Haiti even further by closing a loophole that allows Haitians access tomoney in American bank accounts, Administration officials said today.
That step is being recommended by President Clinton's top experts on Haiti, including his special adviser, William H. Gray 3d. But Treasury and Justice Department officials are reviewing such a move, and Mr. Clinton's approval is not certain. 
 Until now just 600 military leaders and supporters on a list kept by Washington have been barred from access to their money. Mr. Clinton this month banned financial transactions between the United States and Haiti, but that served just to prevent Haitians from wiring money to Haiti from their American accounts.
At a high-level meeting last week Mr. Gray told his counterparts that affluent Haitians were evading that prohibition by transferring their money from the United States to unaffected accounts abroad, where the money can be easily reclaimed.
 
Alternative to Military Action
 By proposing that Mr. Clinton freeze Haitians' assets, the advisers have recommended yet another effort to increase pressure on Haitian military leaders and their supporters without resorting to the military action that Mr. Clinton has said may be necessary to oust them.
As part of a parallel plan to undermine the leaders of the Haitian coup in 1991, Administration officials said today that United States military aircraft equipped with broadcast equipment would probably play the central role in a new effort to carry out a radio-borne propaganda campaign. The officials said the plan called for the aircraft to establish a "radio station in the sky" to broadcast messages aimed at members of the military as well as civilians. The missions would be flown by units that carried out similar operations in the American invasion of Panama in 1989 and the Persian Gulf war in 1991.
The broadcasts, which could include messages from the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the elected President whom the military ousted, would seek to assure rank-and-file soldiers that they need not fear the consequences of Father Aristide's return and to dissuade Haitians from fleeing their country by boat.
But there were new feelings of bitterness within the Administration today toward Father Aristide, who issued a statement on Monday night that described a new American effort to allow hearings for fleeing Haitians as amounting to "the same cynical joke" as the previous policy, which required their automatic return to Port-au-Prince.
The statement was the latest in a series of criticisms by Father Aristide of an Administration that has pledged to restore him to power, and American officials said it might complicate planning for the broadcasts. The officials said the Administration was very likely to insist on veto rights over the content of any broadcast that Father Aristide might seek to make.
 
Earlier Plan for Ships
 American officials had earlier said the broadcasts would be beamed from a ship-borne station. But officials described the plan today to deploy the aircraft as a new step in their efforts to persuade the Haitian leaders to give up their posts. A spokeswoman for the Defense Department, Kathleen deLaski, said that the Administration was discussing the broadcasts with Father Aristide and that no final decision had been made.
Other Administration officials said they had settled on airborne transmitters as the best means to insure that the operation could start quickly and that most Haitians could pick up the signals. The transmitters would be on EC-130's, turboprop aircraft used by special operations and psychological operations units. The planes, which could refuel in midair, would most likely fly from MacDill Air Force Base, Fla., or Pope Air Force Base, N.C., a Pentagon official said.
Administration officials said the operation would most likely start in a week. The officials said it was unclear how quickly the proposal to intensify the pressure on wealthy Haitians might reach Mr. Clinton's desk. But some supporters said they believed that it was important that the Administration act quickly to halt the flow of money from accounts in the United States to safer havens.
The Administration is trying to show that it intends to make wealthy Haitians' lives difficult as long as Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras and his fellow coup leaders are in power.
Some Administration officials said they believed the failure to freeze assets altogether had softened the plan's bite. In explaining the decision to ban transactions between the two countries, Administration officials said two weeks ago that they wanted it to remain possible, for example, for a family to use American funds for a child in college in the United States.

26 of 29 From Boat Freed
 PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, June 21 (Special to The New York Times) -- Haitian immigration officials have released all but three of the 29 Haitians whom the United States returned after they were held here for six hours on Monday. The three were identified as ringleaders of a group of 35 who were the first to receive hearings for refugee status under a new United States policy. Six were accepted. The three suspects were arrested on charges of illegally organizing a boat trip out of the country.
The arrest is largely symbolic, because few of those charged have been prosecuted. Typically they have been held for up to 72 hours.
A spokesman for the American Embassy, Stanley Schrager, said those held on Monday were in custody longer than usual because the colonel who could authorize their release was watching a World Cup soccer match on television.
The refugees, including two pregnant women and a baby, were the first to be returned since American officials began interviewing Haitians aboard a huge hospital ship docked at Kingston, Jamaica.

HEADLINE: Jordanian Hints at Flexibility in Israeli Talks

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 21

 BODY:
King Hussein of Jordan told United States officials during a visit here today that he was ready to take major steps toward normal relations with Israel, and that he would not wait for similar progress in Israel's dealings with Syria and other Arab countries.
The notion of solidarity in dealing with Israel has long been honored by Arab countries. But King Hussein told reporters in Washington, "As far as we are concerned, this is a sovereign matter involving Jordan itself and has nothing to do with, nor is it tied to, movements on any other track." 
 The projects under discussion include roads between Israel and Jordan and a park that would include parts of Israel and Jordan, Administration officials said today.
King Hussein does not plan to establish full relations with Israel until a formal peace agreement is signed and a long-standing border dispute is settled, Administration officials acknowledge, but they say Jordan plans to embrace many aspects of normal relations as talks progress.
"They're putting in place the building blocks for normalization," a senior Administration official said. "There's little doubt in my mind that the King is determined to move ahead."
 
The First Domino?
 Administration officials are eager to trumpet Jordan's new attitude not only because they helped nudge Jordan along in its talks with Israel but also because some are frustrated by Secretary of State Warren Christopher's lack of progress in pushing Syria and Israel to reach a peace agreement. Mr. Christopher met with King Hussein on Monday, and President Clinton is to see him on Wednesday.
The King's stance is important, Administration officials say, because Jordan could become the first Arab country other than Egypt to normalize relations with Israel. Jordan's flexibility could also lead the Syrian President, Hafez al-Assad, to be less intransigent in his slow-moving indirect talks with Israel.
At a news conference, King Hussein said the Arab parties -- Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and the Palestine Liberation Organization -- had never coordinated their bilateral talks with Israel as they had hoped.
 
Important Little Compromises
 As evidence of Jordan's readiness to improve relations, United States diplomats say that for the first time Israeli and Jordanian leaders have agreed to hold open peace talks in each other's country. Those talks are to be held next month.
Also important is an agreement in principle that Israel and Jordan reached two weeks ago in Washington to build a road linking Aqaba, Jordan, to Eilat, an Israeli resort, and Taba, Egypt. Jordan and Israel are also drafting a joint plan to develop the Jordan Valley -- a dry area through which the Jordan River trickles to the Dead Sea. This plan would include a national park linking historic areas in each country.
The two countries have also agreed to discuss cooperation in civil aviation, though flights are not currently allowed between Jordan and Israel, and plan talks on water rights, tourism and the environment.
"What we're seeing is a very concrete set of projects in which these two countries are cooperating," an Administration official said. "It's a change in the landscape."
Jordanian diplomats said an important factor behind their move toward normal relations was Israel's agreement to negotiate the border dispute, which involves 128 square miles of land from the Gulf of Aqaba to the Dead Sea, and a half-square-mile parcel south of the Sea of Galilee, in the Jordan Valley.
King Hussein said today, "An issue that is very important to us is to regain our soveignty over areas that are occupied by Israel in southern Jordan."
 
The Business of Peace
 Jordan has felt pressure because of the self-rule agreement that Israel and the P.L.O. signed last month. Jordanian officials have complained that the accord largely ignored Jordan's economic interests, for example, by setting strict limits on the amount of cement, fertilizer, televisions and other Jordanian goods that can be exported duty-free to the Palestinians.
One Jordanian priority is to negotiate greater access to the Palestinian market. But Palestinians may fear the increased competition.
In exchange for flexiblity toward Israel, King Hussein is seeking economic aid from Washington and help in modernizing his armed forces. "He surely wants to see that there's a level of American support for the steps he's taken," a senior Administration official said.

HEADLINE: Rebuke and Revenge at Met Life

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BUTLER, Pa.

 BODY:
Rick Sabo came from a family in which all three sons went to work selling life insurance for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. So immersed were the three brothers in the business that they joked about tattooing themselves with the Met Life logo, and their parents in this town near Pittsburgh began collecting Met Life memorabilia.
The work offered a good living. "The money kind of lured me into the industry," recalled Mr. Sabo, now 30 years old. "My brother was driving a Mercedes and bought a five-bedroom house." 
 But within a few years, the seamy sales practices of some fellow agents who were favorites among the Met Life hierarchy in western Pennsylvania started to trouble Mr. Sabo. Unlike many of his colleagues, he began complaining to his superiors, thinking that management would be grateful. His reward: he was fired.
 
 
State Investigation
 Mr. Sabo got his revenge. He gave state regulators evidence that led to an investigation and a blistering report that forced Met Life to offer restitution this past spring to more than 60,000 Pennsylvania customers who could show they were improperly persuaded to replace their old policy with a new one or were improperly sold life insurance in the guise of a retirement or savings plan.
The Pennsylvania report and the $1.5 million fine levied on Met Life are part of a growing crackdown by state regulators -- there is no Federal regulation of insurance companies -- on sales practices by the country's 600,000 sales agents and the 3,000 life insurance companies they represent. Met Life has recently taken the brunt of the criticism, and earlier this year was fined a record $20 million in a multistate settlement of improper sales activities conducted from its Tampa, Fla., office.
Other companies -- among them Prudential Insurance, John Hancock and New York Life -- have been accused of similar misdeeds in recent lawsuits by customers.
Insurance companies say that actions by a minority of agents are giving the entire industry a bad reputation. But even if that is true, there are many agents who are aware of misdeeds by their colleagues and do nothing about it. Cynthia M. Maleski, Pennsylvania's insurance commissioner, said that was why she was urging the industry to develop "some sort of self-policing and peer review" system, like that of doctors and lawyers.
In the meantime, though, the role has fallen to courageous agents like Rick Sabo.
For more than a year after he came out of the Marine Corps in 1988 and started selling insurance, Mr. Sabo was too concerned about his own job to pay much attention to grand reforms. "I was a wide-eyed company man," he said, "in my own little world on my own little career."
His first hints that not all agents did what was right for the customer came a few weeks after joining his brother Craig's office. While looking at records of what agents call "orphan" accounts -- those whose original sales agent had moved on -- he was surprised when another agent looking over his shoulder exclaimed about the "juice" in some of the customer accounts.
Juice, Mr. Sabo soon learned, is the cash value of insurance policies sold years ago and kept in force by customers who dutifully pay their premiums. In western Pennsylvania, such customers were the targets of agents who specialized in what the state report issued last February called churning.
Some Met Life agents would convince customers that by drawing on the accumulated cash value of old policies, they could have new, enhanced policies free. But often, the illusion of free insurance lasted only a few years, until the value of the old policy was exhausted and the customer was hit with a larger-than-expected premium payment.
The practice can produce a large commission for agents even while the consumer and insurance company suffer. Customers can be hurt because if they stop paying premiums on the new policy they lose all benefits, including the cash value accumulated in the old policy. Met Life was hurt because of unhappy customers, and the high commissions it was paying to agents who sold the new policies.
Although Met Life's training manuals discourage the practice and its record-keeping system was designed to spot the practice, agents in Western Pennsylvania knew how to beat the system. To avoid company rules barring payment of full commissions on sales of new policies that replace existing policies, agents left the existing policy in place but used the dividends from that policy to finance a new policy.
But knowing that the practice continued anyway, Met Life kept track of such sales and set a guideline under which they would account for no more than 15 percent of the policies sold by an agent. But because the Met Life computer kept track of only the first agent named on a new policy, Mr. Sabo said, agents would share their customers and split the commissions to keep below the 15 percent threshold.
 
 
Two Agents Cited
 Agents who specialized in selling new policies financed by old policies were helped by Gary P. Antonino, a regional vice president who saw audit reports of the activity but took no action, according to the state report.
Mr. Sabo recalled that as a new agent he was surprised to hear so many complaints, particularly about two agents, Joel Sherman and Ronald Shram, both of whom were cited in the state report as very active in the business of restructuring old policies. "Those two guys were Gary Antonino's two best salesmen," Mr. Sabo said, noting that their success increased Mr. Antonino's pay package.
Even so, Mr. Sabo did not immediately begin pushing for change, even though it meant telling disgruntled customers that there was nothing he could do about their complaints. He noted that sales practices in the Butler office were different from those of other western Pennsylvania offices because his brother Craig, who was the branch manager, had resisted Mr. Antonino's efforts to have Mr. Sherman or Mr. Shram use the Butler branch's records to pursue customers with juice in their policies.
Nor, Mr. Sabo said, did the Butler branch succumb to Mr. Antonino's pressure to use marketing material that improperly described insurance as a savings or retirement plan. For example, the marketing literature failed to mention insurance and talked instead of customers' making deposits instead of paying premiums.
Mr. Antonino denied in an interview that he had ever put pressure on the Butler office to share its customer lists or use the "retirement" marketing literature.
A complaint from the parents of the fiancee of a co-worker he had recruited finally led Mr. Sabo to action. "If I just walked away from them, what message would I be sending to this new kid?" he asked. He told the family to take their complaint about a falsified illustration of a new policy showing incorrect benefits to Met Life's regional office in Johnstown, Pa., bypassing the local agent. Met Life issued the family a refund.
 
 
Unhappy Customer
 Later in 1990, Mr. Sabo's referral to the Pennsylvania Insurance Department of another unhappy customer whose policy improperly identified him as a nonsmoker brought the customer a full refund from Met Life. But as with the earlier complaint, Mr. Sabo was rebuked by Mr. Antonino for not being a team player.
When he took complaints from unhappy customers to the company, Mr. Sabo said, he was motivated in part by self-interest. There would be more opportunity for advancement if the bad agents were weeded out. "I thought that when I proved my arguments, the company would welcome me with open arms," he said. Instead, he lamented, after he proved his colleagues acted improperly, "the company lets them fire me."
He was fired in March 1992 on what he calls trumped-up charges of disloyalty, concocted after he investigated the complaint of a third customer. Mr. Sabo said he grew angrier when Mr. Antonino opposed his claims for unemployment compensation and back pay, when his business records were withheld, and when Met Life agents tried to steal his customers.
Mr. Sabo finally took his complaints about the churning of old policies and improper marketing of insurance as a retirement plan to the state insurance department in March 1993. After the state report and a housecleaning by Met Life, Mr. Sabo said he felt "somewhat vindicated," though dismayed that agents and supervisors criticized in the state report had not lost their licenses. Some, like Mr. Antonino, have left Met Life but are still in the insurance business.
 
 
Outlet for Anger
 Mr. Sabo now operates an insurance agency grandiosely named Money Concepts International; Craig Sabo has left the company for other insurance sales work; the third brother, Randy, remains a Met Life agent. After two years of being depressed and distraught, Rick Sabo has found an outlet for his anger: promoting the cause of consumers harmed by questionable sales practices. He has accused Met Life and some of its agents of racketeering in a lawsuit in state court, and has decided that "whatever I can do to keep these problems about insurance sales in the public eye is in my best interest."
Charles Sahner, a spokesman for Met Life, said that the business practices in the Pittsburgh area "should never have happened" and that the company was now "making sure that the restitution program moves forward and we fully protect policyholders from loss" as a result of improper activities. He declined to comment on Mr. Sabo's lawsuit against Met Life and former agents and supervisors in the Pittsburgh area except to say that "we are a big company and big companies are often sued by former employees."
Mr. Sabo's new activities do not pay much, however. He works as a consultant with a few law firms handling consumer lawsuits against insurance companies, but says that last year he earned less than half the $72,000 he says he earned in his last year with Met Life. His Spartan one-room office is not yet busy enough to need a full-time secretary.
And he does not expect to get rich off his whistle-blowing. Unlike workers for Government contractors, who have been rewarded with millions of dollars for reporting wrongdoing, Mr. Sabo and others like him in the insurance business do not have the benefit of laws that reward whistle-blowers and offer protection against vengeful supervisors.

"My rich uncle sent me to college -- Uncle Sam," said Mr. Machado, now 70 years old, who went on to earn a law degree and become a state judge. Under the G.I. Bill, he received full tuition of $85 a semester and a monthly stipend of $250 that covered the living expenses of his family of four. 
 Almost 50 years later, Jacqueline Williams got out of the Air Force and entered a two-year college, but the $4,800 a year she receives under the G.I. bill did not begin to cover her tuition. It will cover even less when Ms. Williams begins a nursing program this fall at Incarnate Word College here, where the tuition is $13,500. She draws from Federal student loans and holds two jobs to pay her expenses.
A half century after Congress passed the G.I. Bill, a debate over the legislation's relative worth is growing. The bill, formally titled the American Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944, is credited with elevating a generation of working-class veterans to the middle class. It opened higher education to the masses, fueled a housing boom and turned renters into homeowners through low-interest, no-money-down mortgages.
 
Bill's Economic Value Erodes
 But today the legislation has lost much of its economic impact and, as a result, much of its appeal to veterans.
After World War II, the bill's benefits stretched over 48 months, compared with 36 months now. The $50 monthly benefit for a single veteran in the 1940's has increased in the last 50 years, to $400, but the increase has not made up for the rapid rise in inflation. Mr. Machado's $250 a month after the war is now equivalent to $2,107, according to the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics.
"The G.I. Bill's purchasing power has just evaporated," said Phil Boudon, a spokesman for the American Legion, which was instrumental in pushing President Franklin D. Roosevelt to support the bill.
Representative G. V. (Sonny) Montgomery, the Mississippi Democrat who is chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee and is a World War II veteran himself, said, "It doesn't really get the job done."
It rankles veterans, too, that the G.I. Bill has evolved to resemble life insurance. First-year servicemen and women need to invest $100 a month for 12 months to be eligible for education benefits, which they can take advantage of while in the service or up to 10 years after discharge.
But the program has built up a surplus in the Treasury. Only 35.2 percent of the eligible participants -- those on active duty and veterans -- used their benefits last year, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs.
Since 1985, when the current legislation was passed, about half of all eligible veterans have used their educational benefits. They have been awarded $1.6 billion in educational benefits from 1985 through January, but $1.9 billion more sits unused in the Treasury.
 
Legion Would Double Benefits
 The rising complaints by veterans about the erosion in benefits have prompted the 3.1-million member American Legion to lobby Congress to revise the bill again. It proposes doubling the benefit, either by extending the stipend period to 72 months, or by raising it to $800 a month.
The Department of Veterans Affairs said it was aware that the G.I. Bill does not pay for all education costs, but it declined to comment on the American Legion's proposal.
For a wide swath of American society in the years immediately after World War II, the legislation was Government at its best.
For the nation's colleges and universities, it provided a long and profitable boom. In 1940, only 4.6 percent of the population had attended college for four years or more, according to the Education Department, compared with 23.2 percent of the population in March 1991, the most recent period for which statistics are available.
Institutions like Marlboro College in Marlboro, Vt., were founded to accommodate the new demand for higher education after World War II.
"Without the G.I. bill, Marlboro would have never been started," said Roderick Gander, its president. From 55 veterans in 1947, who attended classes in cow barns, the college, a private liberal arts institution, has grown to 250 students, he said.
 
Boom in College Building
 The G.I. bill also caused enrollments at existing institutions to swell. At the University of Miami, enrollment jumped to 7,000 in 1946 from 1,900 in 1945. At the time, the university, which is private and nonsectarian, was just 18 years old. The boom in enrollment stuffed its limited classrooms, but tuition payments from the G.I. Bill, along with additional assistance from the Federal Government, helped finance the building of many campus structures that are still in use.
The G.I. Bill provided the biggest boon, though, to two-year colleges. By 1947, there were 328 community colleges in the nation, up from just 58 three years earlier; enrollment in these institutions -- which provided the bulk of job-training opportunities for returning veterans -- ballooned to 500,000 in 1947 from 251,290 in 1944, according to the American Association of Community Colleges.
In San Antonio, the G.I. Bill contributed significantly to the city's seven colleges and universities. It is the only city in the nation with five military bases -- Fort Sam Houston, Randolph Air Force Base, Lackland Air Force Base, Kelly Air Force Base and Brooks Air Force Base -- and its 1.3 million residents include 74,000 active and retired military personnel. Here, the G.I. bill's decline is sharply felt.
"The benefits are not enough for one person," said Ms. Williams, the former Air Force accounting specialist from San Antonio. Ms. Williams, 29, is a single mother who works two jobs -- as a clerk during the day at Randolph Air Force Base and a grocery bagger in a supermarket at night .
 
Facing Loss of Benefits
 After attending St. Philip's College, a two-year public institution in San Antonio, Ms. Williams will begin attending the nursing program at Incarnate Word College, a private and more expensive Roman Catholic institution. Her G.I. Bill benefits will run out in eight months, a year before she gets her nursing degree.
"I don't know how I'm going to do it," Ms. Williams said. "But somehow I'll manage."
Another current G.I. Bill beneficiary, Chad W. Zuliani, manages to get by with the support of periodic loans from an older brother. He also supplemented his G.I. Bill benefits by working last semester as an assistant at Fort Sam Houston National Cemetery in San Antonio.
"The bottom line is that I couldn't do this on my own," said Mr. Zuliani, 27, who left the Air Force two years ago after serving four years as an ophthalmologist's assistant. Hoping to become an athletic coach at the college level, he, like Ms. Williams, worries about stretching his benefits to finish college.
 
Veterans in College Decline
 Not surprisingly, colleges and universities can no longer rely on the G.I. Bill to help increase enrollment. At St. Philip's College here, the percentage of students who are veterans was down to 14 percent in the current academic year, from a high of 85 percent after the Vietnam War.
Alfonso T. Carmona, who now heads the veterans affairs department at St. Philip's, spoke about what the G.I. Bill had meant to him. A retired Air Force captain, he grew up in Galveston, Tex., as one of eight children in a poor family.
Mr. Carmona used the G.I. Bill to attend college while he was still in the Air Force. After earning his bachelor's degree in Spanish and social science at William Carey College in Mississippi, he became a commissioned officer.
"My salary doubled and our quality of life improved," Mr. Carmona said.
Mr. Machado, the Texas judge who grew up poor in San Antonio, said: "If it hadn't been for the G.I. Bill, a lot us would not be lawyers, doctors or engineers." Without it, he said, the best he could have hoped for was a good blue-collar job.
"The G.I. Bill," he said, "changed my life."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bond Yields Increase as Dollar Falls

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Yields on Treasury securities rose modestly yesterday amid rising market expectations of another Federal Reserve move to raise short-term interest rates.
The dollar plunged in international currency markets. In New York trading, the dollar plunged to 99.90 Japanese yen, the lowest level since World War II, before rebounding to close at 100.30 yen, the lowest postwar close. The dollar also fell against the German mark. Fed officials have said that a sharp drop in the dollar's value might prompt them to strongly consider an increase in interest rates. 
 There was also market concern that the apprehension about another rise in short-term rates would affect the outcome of the two-year note auction. The two-year note was awarded at a high yield of 6.04 percent in solid but not aggressive bidding.
 
 
Some Buyers Stay Away
 Some traders said the results were a little weaker than expected, considering that the when-issued yield had risen to an attractive 6 percent return before the auction. But some large buyers, not knowing whether the Fed would raise short-term rates after they had bought notes with a lower rate, stayed away.
The Government will auction $11 billion of new five-year notes today and $16.5 billion of one-year bills tomorrow. In late when-issued trading yesterday, the five-year note was offered at a price to yield 6.81 percent, while the rate on a one-year issue rose 8 basis points, to 4.98 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Mark Grant, managing director and head of fixed income at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, called yesterday a watershed in the tenure of the Clinton Administration. The dollar's fall to 99.90 yen in New York, he said, "will cause a number of reactions." Mr. Grant said a lack of Wall Street confidence in the Clinton Administration, combined with concern in other world markets about the health of the American economy, would have far-reaching effects.
Mr. Grant said the turmoil in the currency markets might require the Fed to raise short-term rates, and maybe even the discount rate, to stabilize the dollar. "I think these events will be coming shortly," he said.
He added: "For the Fed not to respond to the declining dollar is incomprehensible. The costs of goods in the world are to a very large degree pegged in dollars."
 Another recent source of market irritation, the Commodity Research Bureau index, a measure of futures contract prices and a harbinger of inflationary price pressures, slipped again yesterday. But the prices of some precious metals rose, with the contract for June delivery of gold settling up $5.40, to $394.30 an ounce, on the Commodity Exchange.
In late trading in the Treasury market, the 30-year bond fell 12/32 , to 8511/32 , for a yield of 7.49 percent, up from 7.46 percent on Monday. Treasury bills and notes rose the most because their value is tied to changes in interest rates set by the Fed. The yield on the 5.50 percent note due in April 2000 rose 7 basis points, to 6.85 percent, and a 6.50 percent three-year note due in May 1997 rose 9 basis points, to 6.32 percent.
Some analysts say the market will continue to hold its negative bias as it comes to grips with the potential for another Fed tightening, which would be the fifth of the year.
The Treasury said yesterday that the Federal budget deficit was $32.05 billion in May, in line with expectations. Analysts said it represented a solid narrowing from the $37 billion posted in the period a year earlier.
The following are the results of yesterday's auction of new two-year Treasury notes:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)
 
High Yield . . . 6.04%
Low Yield . . . 5.97%
Median Yield . . . 6.01%
Accepted at low price . . . 43%
Total applied for . . . $44,868 970
Accepted . . . $17,006,817
Noncompetitive . . . $1,438,000
Interest set at . . . 6%
 
The two-year notes mature on June 30, 1996.

HEADLINE: Dow Plunges 33.93 on Dollar's Fall

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE 

 BODY:
The stock market suffered a sharp decline yesterday for the third consecutive session as traders continued to be roiled by the turmoil in the international currency markets.
Stocks plummeted as analysts again cited the fall of the dollar, which sank to a postwar low against the Japanese yen. The wilting dollar puts more pressure on the Federal Reserve to consider another interest rate increase when its policy-making committee meets next on July 5 and 6. Higher interest rates would slow the United States economy and make bonds more attractive to investors relative to equities. 
 The widely watched Dow Jones industrial average, which was in minus ground all day long, closed down 33.93 points, to 3,707.97. The Dow plunged more than 55 points in intraday trading, triggering the uptick rule of the New York Stock Exchange, imposed when the average falls more than 50 points in a day in an effort to limit computer-driven program trading. It was the third consecutive session that the Dow had lost more than 30 points. The blue-chip average dropped 34.88 points on Monday and 34.56 points on Friday.
Among broader market indicators, the Standard & Poor's 500 index dropped 4.14 points, to 451.34, and the Nasdaq composite index declined 10.06 points, to 708.79. Trading volume on the Big Board was 298.7 million shares -- about the average for this year -- and declines exceeded advances by a ratio of more than 3 to 1.
Automotive stocks helped to fuel the broad market decline on heavy volume. General Motors fell 1 1/4, to 52; Ford Motor dropped 3/4, to 58 1/4, and Chrysler declined 7/8, to 47.
Electric equipment issues were also hit hard. General Electric was down 1 1/4, to 46 1/8, and Westinghouse was down 1/4, to 12 1/4.
In contrast, aluminum stocks rose in keeping with the strength in aluminum prices. Alcoa advanced 7/8, to 74 3/8, and Alcan increased 1/8, to 22 7/8.
Philip Morris was another issue that closed on the upside yesterday. The big tobacco and food company gained 1, to 51 3/4, after saying that it would consider an expanded stock buyback, an increased dividend or strategic acquisitions.
Sheffield Medical Technologies, which said that it had acquired the exclusive rights to an H.I.V.-AIDS vaccine, was up 7/16 , to 49/16 .
But it was difficult to find much positive news during the day and edgy investors hastened to sell many stocks. Damark International, which said that its second-quarter earnings would fall below analysts' expectations, retreated 2 7/8, to 6 5/8.
 
Caterpillar Off 4 1/4
 Caterpillar, which had four plants struck by the United Automobile Workers union, declined 4 1/4, to 102 1/8. Disney was off 1 5/8, to 43, after a Federal official voiced concern over its proposed theme park in Manassas, Va.
U.S. Healthcare fell 2 5/8, to 40 1/2, after saying late on Monday that it was not for sale. And Snapple Beverage dropped 1 1/4, to 22 3/4, when it said it would buy two distributors and reached an agreement to invest in a third.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Trammell Crow Picks Chief From Empire's Hotel Unit

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DALLAS, June 21

 BODY:
The Trammell Crow Company reached beyond its real estate development business today, but not the Crow family's empire, to name James D. Carreker as its new chief executive.
Mr. Carreker, a former department store executive, will remain in charge of the family's Wyndham Hotels and Resorts. As such, his appointment exemplifies how much the commercial real estate business has become like other service industries. 
 Even during an interview at Trammell Crow Company offices in Dallas today, Mr. Carreker was asking other executives about a company that is by far the nation's largest real estate manager. It provides leasing, maintenance and other services for about 250 million square feet of commercial space, or more than all the office space in midtown Manhattan.
Mr. Carreker spoke of learning more about the business from J. McDonald Williams, the retiring chief executive who in turn will replace Trammell Crow as chairman. Mr. Carreker plans to apply the management techniques -- in areas like purchasing, cost control and customer satisfaction -- that he polished at Wyndham Hotels and observed at other companies.
Like Electronic Data Services, the computer services company also based in Dallas, Trammell Crow can take advantage of its size, skills and purchasing power, he said. "We can be the E.D.S. of elevators," he said, noting that Crow has a national contract with Otis Elevators to obtain the best possible prices.
Mr. Williams, although only 52 years old, has said he wants to spend more time on civic affairs. Among other duties, he is chairman of the Dallas Citizens Council, the city's most influential business group.
Mr. Williams has managed the Crow Company and its predecessors since 1977, turning a loose development partnership into a corporation run tightly enough to survive the nation's real estate debacle of recent years.
Mr. Carreker conservatively estimated that as a developer the Crow Company was at least 10 times the size of Donald Trump's operations at their peak. Crow executives, however, appear to have less interesting personal lives.
With opportunities for building office towers or shopping centers much more scarce than a decade ago, the Crow company has nearly abandoned the flashy development business for the more plodding but now profitable routines of leasing office space and vacuuming floors.
It says it can deliver higher rents, occupancy rates and tenant satisfaction than corporations or investors who manage their own buildings.
Mr. Carreker, who is 47, is an Oklahoman by birth, education and affable manner. He received his B.A. and M.B.A. from Oklahoma State University, and built his career at the Sanger-Harris department stores, based in Dallas.
He later joined Burdines, a retailing chain based in Miami that is part of Federated Department Stores. He was president of the chain when he left in 1988 for Wyndham Hotels.
Although the Trammell Crow Company is now emphasizing its management prowess, Mr. Carreker's background could help him revive the company's development and deal-making. He expanded the Wyndham chain through construction and acquisitions.
The naming of Mr. Carreker, who formally takes over Aug. 1, surprised some in the real estate business who had expected a promotion from within the Crow Company.
Business acquaintances said that the appointment demonstrated the continuing influence of both Trammell Crow and his son, Harlan. The family owns 70 percent of Wyndham hotels and 36 percent of the Trammell Crow Company.
Family members applauded Mr. Carreker's performance at Wyndham, which he expanded from 18 to 52 hotels. Mr. Williams said that the company's directors, including several outsiders, also took part in choosing Mr. Carreker, rather than leaving it to the Crow family to orchestrate.

HEADLINE: Family Becomes Issue in the Texas Governor's Race

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, June 21

 BODY:
As their campaign for Governor gets under way, Ann W. Richards and George W. Bush have been trading jabs over the Texas economy, taxes and crime. But today the sparring turned to a highly unusual campaign issue: whether men are frauds.
Speaking to hundreds of high school girls in Austin on Monday, Governor Richards, a Democrat running for re-election, urged the teen-agers to become more self-reliant. 
 "I cannot tell you what a pitfall it is to count on Prince Charming to make you feel better about yourself and take care of you," she said.
"Prince Charming may be driving a Honda and telling you you have no equal, but that's not going to do much good when you've got kids and a mortgage," she continued. "And I could add he's got a beer gut and a wandering eye."
A campaign spokesman for Ms. Richards said that she was simply using "humor and wit" to make an important point.
But Mr. Bush, the Governor's Republican opponent and the eldest son of the former President, was quick to attack the Governor's comments, which he characterized as unfortunate and anti-family.
"This is not the message Texans want their leaders to give our daughters or sons," Mr. Bush said in a statement. "Our leaders should be building up the family, not tearing it down. We want our sons and daughters to look upon marriage as an equal partnership where -- contrary to the Governor's assertion -- husbands and wives help and love each other."
The spokesman for Ms. Richards, Cindy Rugeley, said the message was one the Governor has preached before, about the importance of both sexes assuming responsibility in life. "That's not anti-family," Ms. Rugeley said.
After the speech, Ms. Richards, who is divorced, said she thought it was important for girls to be prepared for the reality that many marriages will end in divorce.
"I know that isn't going to happen to you, but it is going to happen to half of you," she said in the remarks to the 50th anniversary gathering of Texas Girls State, a convention of high school student leaders. Ms. Richards is a 1949 alumna of the gathering.
Some Texans wondered what campaign strategy the Governor might have had in mind when she made her remarks.
One important reason Ms. Richards squeaked to victory in 1990 was her appeal to conservative Republican women, many of whom crossed party lines because they were turned off by the Republican candidate, Clayton Williams. During his campaign, Mr. Williams joked about rape and talked of soliciting prostitutes in his college days.
But, Mr. Bush appeared to calculate, many of those women may have largely devoted themselves to raising children and supporting their husbands' careers and might find offense in the Governor's remarks.
In any event, he accused Ms. Richards of setting the wrong tone for today's teen-agers.
"Life may be hard at times, but I want my daughters to know life is exciting and wonderful and challenging," he said.
Ms. Richards would hardly disagree. But, she said: "I want these girls to understand they must rely on themselves. They must take responsibility for themselves. Girls so often are taught that someone else is going to take care of them."

HEADLINE: Study Finds That Education Does Not Ease Welfare Rolls

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 21

 BODY:
A closely watched experiment in which teen-age mothers were showered with education and social services had no effect in moving them from welfare into the job market, according to a study made public today.
The study is being widely discussed among welfare experts, some of whom believe it casts doubts on a central feature of the Clinton Administration's welfare plan: the decision to focus its training and work programs on young mothers. 
 Skeptics argue that the study, along with previous research, paints a portrait of such mothers as being harder and more expensive to help than older mothers.
"It shows how tough it is to work with young mothers," said Judith Gueron, president of the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation, a non-profit group in New York City that designed and evaluated the program.
 
80 Percent Stay on Welfare
 The program, called New Chance, served 1,408 teen-agers in 10 states. But after 18 months, those who joined the program were no more likely to be off welfare or in a job than a similar group that received no services.
About 80 percent of the mothers from both groups were still collecting welfare, and only 26 percent had worked in the last three months.
President Clinton's welfare proposal would expand training opportunities for women on welfare but require those still unemployed after two years to join a work program.
To save money and allow states time to adapt, he wants to apply the new rules only to mothers born after 1971. Mr. Clinton sent the bill to Congress today.
Melissa Skolfield, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services, said the bill focused on young mothers because they were "most at risk of long-term dependency."
 
Education as Investment
 In addition, she said, the focus on young mothers sends a clear signal to the next generation, that "they should stay in school, delay pregnancy and postpone having children."
Rather than focusing on young mothers alone, Ms. Gueron suggested letting different states choose different strategies.
Emphasizing that education is a long-term investment, Robert Granger, the program's director, said it might take more than 18 months to measure the program's effect on earnings. The mothers' earnings were increasing with time, he said.
The New Chance program did help mothers gain high school equivalency diplomas. Thirty-seven percent of those in the program received the diplomas, compared with 21 percent of the mothers in a control group.
But the program failed to raise actual literacy, with the average women in both groups still reading below the eighth-level.
New Chance also did little to raising parenting skills. And it failed to prevent repeat pregnancies, despite counseling and the offers of contraception.
About 57 percent of the women in the program got pregnant in the 18 months following enrollment, compared with 53 percent of the women in the control group.

HEADLINE: Inflation Concerns Rise With Commodities Prices

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, June 21

 BODY:
Many commodity prices are up sharply this year, ranging from coffee and cotton to crude oil, copper and aluminum. The trend toward rising prices fits neatly into the traditional models of what economists expect at this stage of an economic recovery and, if the past is a guide, the prices consumers pay for many goods and services could rise, too.
What is the main force driving up prices, the fear of shortages or an actual tightening of supplies? And can consumers and manufacturers count on economic models to predict how commodity prices will affect the economy? Such questions, which have no definitive answers, are clinging like the summer humidity to the debate about how strong inflationary pressures are becoming and whether the Federal Reserve needs to raise interest rates again to prevent the economy from overheating.
 
A Sense of Complacency
 Inflation hawks say investors and business executives have been lulled into a sense of complacency recently by the failure of inflation rates to rise along with intermittent run-ups in commodity prices. They say inflation is bound to gather speed because all the broad measures of commodity prices are rising, not just the most volatile ones like the Commodity Research Bureau's 21-commodity index, which is dominated by agricultural products. 
 "We are seeing the strongest upward move since the early 1980's," said Anirvan Banerji, a research economist at the Columbia University Center for Business Cycle Research who designed the index of 18 industrial commodities published daily in the Journal of Commerce.
The index, which tracks the rate of price changes, has risen every month this year and was up more than 15 percent through the end of May, with 15 of 18 items higher than the average for the preceding 12 months. The only item declining was scrap steel, while red oak, which is used in flooring, and corrugated boxes were virtually unchanged.
Two other indexes, the Goldman, Sachs index of 20 commodities traded on futures markets, and the Investable Commodity Index, which tracks the cumulative returns that investors have received on 16 commodities, also reflect the rising prices.
"We are in the sweet spot of the business cycle for commodities," said Timothy O'Neill, partner in charge of commodity products for Goldman, Sachs. Led by a gain of 32 percent in its energy component and an increase of 28 percent in the industrial sector, the Goldman, Sachs index had climbed 14 percent this year as of Friday. With grain prices falling this week, the index has eased to a gain of 11.7 percent for the year.
The Investable Commodity Index was up by more than 13 percent through the end of last week, said Scott Manolis, president of Intermarket Management Inc., a money management firm based in Somerset, N.J., that developed the index as a part of its effort to encourage clients to diversify their investments from stocks, bonds and other financial instruments into commodities. The grain selloff this week pared the gain to 11.1 percent for the year. "We see a three- to five-year upward run coming," Mr. Manolis said.
But many economists say the commodities price trends can be easily misinterpreted. The Commodity Research Bureau's index, which is owned by Knight-Ridder Inc. and is one of the most widely followed by traders and investors, is likely to be especially misleading this year because agricultural products account for so much of its value, including items like coffee and cotton that are in short supply but have little impact on over all inflation.
The C.R.B. index is also reflecting volatility stemming from unusually low stockpiles of several crops. Fears that a drought in the Corn Belt was developing sent corn and bean prices skyrocketing in early June, but those markets tumbled with recent rains. A bad harvest could send prices and the C.R.B. index soaring above previous levels without significantly increasing the threat of widespread inflation.
Economists say the other indexes that give less weight to the weather-sensitive agriculture sector are better indicators of inflation but are still suspect barometers of inflation. "Markets are giving far too much attention to the commodity movements," said Richard D. Rippe, chief economist for Prudential Securities. "The fraction of the economy producing and using commodities is small and getting smaller."
And some commodities users say prices are being driven up by investors anticipating shortages, not current market conditions. They say prices are driven up in anticipation of strikes, supply cutbacks or other events that do not occur, then fail to drop again because some investors flee the weak market in Government bonds and invest in commodities on the general belief that prices are headed up.
"A lot of people investing don't know what they are doing," said Sheldon Wolfe, whose trading company in Skokie, Ill., concentrates on scrap aluminum markets.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;
Study gives name-brand marketers a plan to mount a counterattack on private labels and store brands.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
JUST as a sign admonished Clinton campaign workers to remember "It's the economy, stupid," marketers are being advised to behave as if signs in every corporate board room are reminding them "It's the best value, stupid."
By now it is a truism that marketing has been profoundly affected by the sea change in attitudes since the 1990's began, as value for money spent becomes the crucial attribute sought by consumers choosing among goods and services. Marketers have slashed prices, increased package sizes and eschewed glitz for substance for products like cereal, cigarettes, drugs, fast food and paper goods. 
 Still, the war between name-brand products and their lower-priced counterparts like private labels and store brands rages on. According to a study by Bates U.S.A., formerly Backer Spielvogel Bates Inc., many national marketers continue to be "out-marketed and out-sold" as the fighting shifts from attributes like quality, which offer them opportunities to persuasively argue the benefits of brands, to price, which purveyors of cheaper products can almost always undercut.
"The increasing level of price-based competition in the marketplace means brand marketing has diminished, causing brand depreciation," said Frank Assumma, the president and chief executive of Bates U.S.A. in New York, offering a preview of his agency's study, which is called "These Prices Are Killing Us: What Brand-Driven Marketers Must Do to Combat Price-Based Competition."
"There has been price-oriented competition since the dawn of time, but it was not a crisis," Mr. Assumma said. He said the problem had intensified because "the disparity in pricing had gotten too great" during the period from the 1987 stock market crash through the 1990 recession and because short-term promotional price cuts had "trained the consumer to think if the price is a little too high, don't worry; something else is on deal this week."
And while advertisers and agencies continued to perceive distinctions among brands, whether nationally marketed or supermarket copycat versions, Mr. Assumma said, consumers came to believe that "all brands are equal."
"When we say private label or store brand, a consumer sees a brand, not a cheap brand," he added. "That means all brands have to satisfy an equation," balancing price and quality to form a perceived value, he said.
"This being the death knell for brands is silly," he continued. "What it actually means is that consumers will pay more -- but not that much more."
The study concludes that marketers of name-brand products must take immediate measures to mount a counterattack on the inroads of private-label and store brands. It suggests that marketers take several steps:
*Insure that a brand "more than delivers on its promises" and will "perform better than anything else in meeting a specific consumer need."
*Direct a brand's marketing communications to messages that "convey those benefits to the consumer."
*Ration resources by weeding out poorer-performing marginal brands because "they can't all survive profitably over time."
*Choose between selling name-brand products and the often lucrative sideline of manufacturing and supplying private-label products to retailers, which does nothing but "undermine the health" of branded trademarks.
*Close "the price gap" between name brands and their rivals "to the point where a consumer can afford to remain loyal to the national brand."
*End "unproductive product proliferation" by devoting corporate funds to research and development projects that will yield truly distinctive, innovative name-brand products that consumers see as better or different.
*Become the high value marketer, for example, providing the highest quality for the most reasonable price.
*Build relationships with customers to effectively counter "the bond between consumer and retailer," which stores often exploit by favoring their own products that cost less but produce higher profits than selling name brands.
Finally, it calls on marketers to increase the effectiveness of, and reduce the waste associated with, a brand's advertising campaigns.

Dollar's Plunge Lifts Gold And Other Precious Metals

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar's plunge touched off a rally in gold and other precious metals yesterday, as investors sought a safe haven from financial assets that lose value as the currency tumbles.
Gold prices approached $400 an ounce, ending at their highest levels in more than 10 months. The active August gold contract jumped $5.40, to $396.30 an ounce. 
 Analysts said gold prices would probably continue moving higher as long as the dollar remained under pressure. "In this turbulent atmosphere, being long gold is prudent," said James Steel of Refco.
The surge in gold extended to other metals, with July silver gaining 12 cents, to $5.595 an ounce on the Comex, and July platinum rising $4.60, to $411.10 an ounce, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
But several analysts warned that the rally in precious metals could run out of steam, pointing to a lack of physical demand for the metals and the possibility that the Federal Reserve might push up short-term interest rates for the fifth time this year to support the dollar.
"At this point, they are playing Russian roulette with the Fed and Treasury," Bernard Savaiko, an analyst for Paine Webber, said of the precious metals speculators. He noted that higher metals prices were "rather amazing if you consider inflation is not a threat."
On the inflation front, recent advances in grain prices and various other agricultural commodities had lifted the Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities to a three-and-a-half-year high on Friday. But changing forecasts that called for more rain sent corn and soybean prices falling for the second trading session yesterday, and the C.R.B. index fell 0.58 point, to 234.29, despite gold's gain.
Still, analysts said the same hot, dry weather that caused the market to rally this month could return.
On other commodity markets, oil prices declined steeply as investors unloaded expiring July crude oil futures contracts. July oil set a new high of $20.95 a barrel, but the failure to breach the $21 level sparked selling and it expired 71 cents lower, at $20.04 a barrel. August crude oil dropped 33 cents, to $19.38 a barrel.
And the premium of the July over the August oil contract, which had reached roughly $1 a barrel based on immediate demand in the Midwest, which is short of oil, closed at 66 cents.

DATELINE: OTTAWA, June 21

 BODY:
Canada's merchandise trade surplus widened in April to a record 1.2 billion Canadian dollars ($864 million) thanks to strong sales of cars and trucks to the United States, Statistics Canada reported today. The surplus was 866 million Canadian dollars in March and 796 million in April last year. The surplus with the United States rose to 2.3 billion Canadian dollars ($1.7 billion) in April from 2.1 billion in March. After a lull late last year, exports have regained momentum as the driving force behind Canada's economic growth.

HEADLINE: George Michael Loses Lawsuit Against Sony

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LONDON, June 21

 BODY:
In a case that mixed questions about artistic freedom, money and ego, a British judge today rejected a bid by the pop singer George Michael to be freed from his long-term recording contract with the Sony Corporation.
The ruling was welcomed by industry executives, who saw in Mr. Michael's case a challenge to the traditional practice of signing artists to multi-album deals as a way to offset their heavy investments in discovering and promoting new acts. 
 But it prompted Mr. Michael, one of the biggest stars of the late 1980's, to call his situation "professional slavery" that left him little control over his own work and career.
 
A 15-Year Contract
 Mr. Michael had filed suit against Sony a year and a half ago, contending that the eight-album contract he signed in 1988 was unfair under British and European Union law because it bound him to the company for up to 15 years and gave him no control over how his music would be marketed.
Mr. Michael testified that his discontent followed Sony's reaction to his 1990 album "Listen Without Prejudice, Volume I." With that album, Mr. Michael said, he made a deliberate decision to play down the sultry, sex-symbol image he had cultivated starting with his days with the pop duo Wham, a decision he said did not sit well with Sony executives interested only in sales and not in his development as an artist.
He also testified that Sony had sought to punish him by not promoting "Listen Without Prejudice" as aggressively as it should have, particularly in the United States. The album sold five million copies, a relative disappointment after his 1988 album "Faith" sold 14 million copies worldwide.
Sony executives testified that they had marketed the album to the best of their abilities. And Sony's lawyers tried throughout the trial to establish that Mr. Michael was well aware of the terms of the contract he signed in 1988, and that the deal was a considerable improvement over his earlier contracts with CBS Records, which Sony acquired seven years ago.
 
Ruling: A Fair Deal
 In issuing his ruling today in the High Court in London, Justice Jonathan Parker largely accepted Sony's view of the matter, saying that the contract was "reasonable and fair" and that Mr. Michael understood the deal.
"I am satisfied on the evidence that there is no substance in George Michael's claim of unfair conduct by Sony or in any of the detailed complaints which he makes," Justice Parker's ruling said. "In particular I am satisfied that there was no such deliberate policy decision by Sony as George Michael alleges."
At a brief news conference, Mr. Michael said that he thought there were strong grounds for an appeal and that he would probably file one.
But the singer, who turns 31 on Saturday, declined to answer questions about whether he would make good on his earlier threat never to record again for Sony.
Sony, clearly trying to avoid further damage to its relationship with Mr. Michael, restricted its official reaction to a one-sentence statement: "We have great respect for George Michael and his artistry, and look forward to continuing our relationship with him."
 
A Way to Recoup
 The case had been followed intently in the recording industry, not just because it was a rare instance of a spat between between artist and label being aired publicly and in great detail, but because of the precedent it could have set regarding long-term contracts.
Recording companies have always argued that because they spend so much to find and develop new artists, they can recoup their investments only through long-term relationships with those relatively few acts who go on to major success. If artists were given freedom to break their contracts and walk away after an album or two, the companies would no longer be able to afford to spend so much on new talent, executives said.
"The concern we had was that the judge might have found against long-term contracts between artists and record companies," said David Hughes, a spokesman for EMI Records in London. "Had the judge found that, it would have had quite severe implications for us in our confident ability to invest in artists."
At the news conference, Mr. Michael said he had signed the 1988 contract "to make the best of a bad job" and sued only when left with no other option.
"In fact, there is no such thing as resignation for an artist in the music industry," Mr. Michael said. "Effectively, you sign a piece of paper at the beginning of your career and you are expected to live with that decision, good or bad, for the rest of your professional life."

HEADLINE: The G.I. Bill, 50 Years On

 BODY:
Not all the great victories in World War II took place on the battlefield. What proved a landmark triumph for America and its fighting forces had its start in the White House 50 years ago today when President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the G.I. Bill of Rights. Few laws have done so much for so many, yet the anniversary of this political and social counterpart of D-Day has been all but forgotten.
Formally known as the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944, this innovative bill was ambitious in design and laudable in purpose: to help 10 million veterans, and their country, adapt to peacetime. The measure offered guaranteed loans to buy a home, farm or business; 52 weeks of unemployment insurance at $20 per week, plus job placement services; and most enduringly important, up to four years of Federal aid for learning or training at any level, from grade to graduate school. 
 And so Americans who never dared dream of attending college joined a flood that crested in 1946-1947, when 2.5 million veterans qualified for $500 or more in annual tuition, plus monthly allowances of $65 for single students, $90 for married. Almost overnight on U.S. campuses, Quonset huts and prefab houses bloomed to accommodate this influx. In a stroke, the legislation kept a demobilizing army from engulfing the labor force, threw open cloistered academic doors and offered energizing plasma to schools of every kind, public or private.
The special genius of the law was that it bypassed old arguments over states' rights and tax aid to religious institutions by extending its benefits to individual citizens, who had wide freedom of choice. This notable home-front victory was chiefly the work of President Roosevelt. As early as November 1942, he had asked a panel of educators to design a comprehensive program for ex-servicemen and -women. In summer 1943, in a message to Congress and in a radio fireside chat he urged approval of the panel's core recommendations, and got vital support from the otherwise staunchly conservative American Legion.
Even so, the school provisions were assailed by John Rankin, the race-baiting Mississippi Democrat who headed the House Veterans Committee; he protested that blacks were incapable of benefiting from college. Less predictably, President Robert Maynard Hutchins of the University of Chicago gloomily warned that "colleges and universities will find themselves converted into intellectual hobo jungles. And veterans unable to get work and equally unable to resist putting pressures on colleges and universities will find themselves educational hoboes."
Such prophecies were wildly off the mark. So popular and successful was the law that many of its benefits were extended to Korea and Vietnam veterans, and are now available to those who serve in peacetime. As a Federal stimulus to learning and opportunity, the G.I. Bill ranks with the Land Grant College Act of 1862, which promoted the growth of the state universities.
It is useful to be reminded periodically that Federal spending is not always wasteful, and that taxes, to paraphrase Mr. Justice Holmes, can be the agent of civilization.

A Neighborhood's Population
In a One-Man Show
Irish Arts Center
Under all the laughter in Colin Quinn's "Sanctifying Grace" is a rueful meditation on loss that gives this 80-minute play a real bite. The characters Mr. Quinn creates in the one-man show, residents of an Irish neighborhood in Brooklyn in the 1970's, are very funny people. But they hurt without saying so, except for one remark by a woman named Margaret: "We didn't go after what we wanted. We went after what was left." 
 Three former New Yorkers in Hollywood collaborated on the work. Mr. Quinn, a comic television and movie actor, and another actor, Lou DiMaggio, wrote it as stand-up comedy, and the director, Robert Moresco, cut and clipped it into shape, keeping the jokes but making the characters stand out in dramatic clarity.
That they do: Jimmy, the know-it-all neighborhood watchdog; J. T., the dope-dealer so lost in paranoia he cannot recall the drug combination that gave him one hilarious night of perfect sex; Joe, a gaseous bully with an amazing gift for covering his own lies even before they're challenged; Eddie, "the only liberal who ever grew up in the neighborhood"; Aidan, as charming as a viper, and more. It is a pity it is such a man's world; the unforgettable Margaret is a triumph, and Mr. Quinn ought to conjure up more such women.
He is an economical actor, relying on slight tics and habits rather than broader mimicry to embody his characters, but making them most memorable in their words. And his eyes and mouth constantly reveal subtle silences and evasions in these fragile people moving through a story that is a fast sequence of surprise outcomes leading to other surprise outcomes.
"Sanctifying Grace" continues at the Irish Arts Center, 553 West 51st Street, Clinton, through July 16. D. J. R. BRUCKNER

HEADLINE: Price, Not Safety, Drives Yankee Fans Away;
Resist His Blackmail

 BODY:
To the Editor:
We must keep the Yankees in New York City. But it makes little economic sense to spend hundreds of millions on a business that was recently valued at $160 million. The Yankees represent social and political values that ought to be protected if reasonable compromise can be reached, including public expenditures. The amount must be related to value, especially when schools, police and infrastructure are under attack. We ought to keep the Yankees, we ought to pay a rational price, and we ought not let George Steinbrenner blackmail us. 
 If, at the end, he continues to do so, the government should stop him. New York State ought to exercise its powers of eminent domain to condemn the Yankee partnership and keep it in New York. The state could do so by owning the team directly, or for those who find public ownership distasteful, the state could sell shares in the Yankees to the public, similar to what the Green Bay Packers and the Boston Celtics have done.
Or the state could simply spin the Yankees off to another private owner. However, the necessary condition of ownership and operation would be to keep the franchise in New York City.
I personally would find a change of ownership in the best interests of baseball, the public and the community. Mr. Steinbrenner owns the Yankees, however, and is entitled to the protection of the free enterprise system. He is not entitled to enormous tax subsidies, however, at the same time the Yankees are enormously profitable.
If that is the choice that he forces, then the free enterprise system also permits us to use the powers of condemnation to keep the Yankees in New York.

HEADLINE: Big Board Uncovered Short Sales Up; Amex Off

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
For the first time since January, the number of borrowed shares sold short and not yet covered by repurchases fell on the American Stock Exchange in the month that ended on June 8, even as the uncovered short sales rose to a record on the New York Stock Exchange.
In separate reports released yesterday, the New York exchange said that the number of these uncovered shares rose 5.4 percent, to 1.56 billion shares, surpassing the previous record of 1.48 billion shares set for the month that ended on May 6. 
 But the American exchange reported that short interest fell by 2.7 percent in the period, to 110.75 million shares, from 113.78 million for the month that ended on May 6.
Laszlo Birinyi, who runs Birinyi Associates, a research firm in Greenwich, Conn., said improving commodity prices probably played a role in the decline of short interest on the American exchange. Historically, the Amex has listed a lot of Canadian natural resource stocks, including the shares of numerous oil companies.
Mr. Birinyi added that after months of volatility, stock prices consolidated during the month. That sort of bottoming out might tend to dampen short-selling.
"The market is still groping for its footing, but the downward trend has been arrested," he said.
Someone might sell a stock short for several reasons; the most common is an expectation that the price will fall. Until recently, when stock prices stabilized and then rallied, those expectations were realized as prices weakened in the face of rising interest rates.
Shorting a stock is the flip side of buying a security in the hope that it will go up; a short-seller borrows shares, sells them and later buys them back to return to the original owner. If the price has dropped, the short-seller makes a profit.
Traditionally, a high short-interest level indicates that many investors are bearish. But some analysts say big short-interest positions are a positive sign, because the short-sellers eventually have to buy shares.
And others argue that over a relatively limited period of time, changes in short interest may say nothing about market sentiment at all. Proponents of this view note that over the last few years strategies involving short-selling of stocks have become much more complex.
"As investors become more sophisticated in combination investment strategies involving stocks, options and futures contracts, one can no longer look at short interest as an indication of what is going to happen," said Steven Bloom, chief economist at the American exchange.
Last month, two large companies saw huge increases in short interest positions. Short interest in AT&T rose by more than 7 million shares. And short interest in General Electric more than doubled to 8.8 million shares. During the month there were numerous reports about problems at the company's Kidder, Peabody unit.

HEADLINE: THE SIMPSON CASE: THE VICTIM;
Nicole Brown Simpson: Slain At the Dawn of a Better Life

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, June 22

 BODY:
For nearly half her life, Nicole Brown Simpson was known as O. J. Simpson's girlfriend, his wife, then his ex-wife. But in her last days, after she had broken off their efforts to get back together, she had been struggling to be Nicole Brown.
Hours before Mrs. Simpson was killed, she and her family -- her two children, her parents, two of her sisters -- were celebrating her freedom at Mezzaluna, one of her favorite neighborhood restaurants. 
 "She was just so vivacious, so full of life," her older sister, Denise Brown, said in a telephone interview today. "She had just gotten it all together, and it was so exciting. I was so happy for her. For the first time in her life, she was able to have her own friends. We were talking about going to Yosemite, camping, taking the kids to Club Med. Everything was going to revolve around the kids.
"She was so happy," Ms. Brown said. "She had broken up with O. J. a week and a half before. She was going to start her life over. It was going to be without O. J., with her children. Funny thing, she still loved O. J. She just couldn't live with him."
Mrs. Simpson had called the police on the 911 emergency line as recently as Oct. 25, police tapes indicate. [Excerpts, page A20.]
And sometime after she left the restaurant on June 12, Mrs. Simpson was slashed to death on the steps of the town house where she had hoped to forge a new identity. She had just turned 35. She left two children, Sydney, 9, and Justin, 6.
Even now, it is her former husband, charged with the murder of Mrs. Simpson and a friend, Ronald Goldman, who is drawing most of the attention. There is an extensive record of his public life -- as a football star, a television pitchman, Hollywood actor, the man about town with the beautiful, blonde wife on his arm. Far less is known about Nicole Brown, and her life with O. J. Simpson.
"She was totally, totally devoted to this man," Denise Brown said. Then, referring to Mr. Simpson's best friend, Al Cowlings, who helped Mr. Simpson flee the police last Friday, she added, "Even A. C., he says to me, 'Denise, I could not believe a woman could love a man as much as she did, bringing him coffee every morning, in bed.' Every morning for how many years -- 18 years -- she was so in love with him."
They fell in love when she was still a teen-ager, and until their divorce in 1992 they seemed to define the California dream.
His life was her life. The $5 million mansion in Brentwood, on the same street as Meryl Streep, the actress, and Michael Ovitz, chairman of Creative Artists Agency. The $2 million oceanfront house in Laguna Beach. His and her Ferraris. Vacations in Vail, Colo., and Mexico.
But there was a price. Friends of the couple said that he had tried to control the relationship and that even after their divorce he had been possessive about her. The Los Angeles police reported today that last October Mr. Simpson kicked in the backdoor of her house. The police said Mrs. Simpson, who summoned help by dialing 911, told them that Mr. Simpson had visited her earlier in the evening and had become upset over a picture of a former boyfriend in her photo album.
Several times in the last years of their marriage and after the divorce, she called the police. Friends noticed bruises on her arms and neck. In 1989, after a New Year's Eve party, a frantic Nicole Simpson telephoned the police again. As officers arrived, according to police records, she ran out of the bushes, yelling: "He's going to kill me! He's going to kill me!" She had a cut lip, a swollen black eye, a bruised cheek and a handprint on her neck, they said.
Several months later, Mr. Simpson pleaded no contest to spousal battery. A judge fined him $700 and ordered counseling. The couple released a statement saying their marriage had never been stronger.
Around the same time, a smiling, relaxed Mr. Simpson dismissed the incident in a 1989 television interview with ESPN, saying: "We had a fight. We were both guilty. No one was hurt. It was no big deal, and we got on with our life."
 
A Victim Perhaps, But Far More
 Now, Mrs. Simpson's death has touched off a national debate about spousal abuse as a hidden crime. But Denise Brown, 37, says she doesn't want her sister, whom she was closer to than almost anyone, to be remembered only as a victim.
"She was not a battered woman," Ms. Brown said. "My definition of a battered woman is somebody who gets beat up all the time. I don't want people to think it was like that. I know Nicole. She was a very strong-willed person. If she was beaten up, she wouldn't have stayed with him. That wasn't her. Everybody knows about 1989. Does anybody know about any other time?"
Ms. Brown stressed throughout a lengthy interview that she did not want to criticize Mr. Simpson in any way, for the sake of her sister's children and the two children from Mr. Simpson's first marriage. "He's their Dad," she explained. "I love Arnelle and Jason. I love Sydney and Justin. I'm not going to do anything to hurt them."
No one who knew Mrs. Simpson, who was 5 feet 8 inches and about 125 pounds, thought she was weak. Jean Vallely, a writer and mother of four who lives in Brentwood, saw Mrs. Simpson regularly at youth basketball games at the recreation center in Pacific Palisades. Mrs. Simpson would cheer on her daughter, Sydney, who played for the Tar Heels.
Ms. Vallely said she saw Mrs. Simpson and her children at a game the week before she was killed. "You couldn't stop looking at her because she was so striking," Ms. Vallely said. "She was not this frail, skinny little blonde. She had this great body. She was strong, and she worked out."
Back at Dana Hills High School in Orange County, Denise and Nicole Brown had been homecoming princesses. Nicole's home economics teacher, Jo Hanson, said: "Everybody was in awe of her. We get a lot of beautiful students. But she was the ultimate beauty. The girls liked and admired her. The guys were in love with her."
But it was Nicole's father, Lou Brown, who escorted his daughter to the homecoming dance, Mrs. Hanson said.
"I thought she was going to be a model, or a movie star," Mrs. Hanson said. "I used to tease her, 'I should get your autograph now.' "
Nicole was one of five children, four sisters and one brother, who grew up steps from the beach in Monarch Bay, an upper-middle-class beach community in Orange County west of Dana Point. Her father was a small-business investor, who now runs a Hertz rental-car franchise. Her mother, Judy, had dabbled briefly in modeling.
Nicole Brown seemed destined for big things, said Valerie Rigg, who attended high school with her. "People said somebody wealthy and famous would nab her," Ms. Rigg said. "She just seemed bound for that." She added, "Nicole was famous to us."
Though Nicole was not the oldest of the Brown sisters, she was viewed as the most mature. "I remember her presence, her bearing," said Bill Prestridge, recalling her from his journalism class. "She didn't have that girlish laughter."
After high school, she went to work as a waitress in a Beverly Hills nightclub, the Daisy. She tried modeling but apparently didn't like it.
 
A Restless Beauty, A Vulnerable Athlete
 Then she met O. J. at the Daisy. She was barely 18. He was 30, and at a turning point. His first marriage was breaking up; his fabled knees were failing. The attraction was immediate and intense.
"I was living in New York and modeling when she told me about him," Denise Brown said. "I said, 'Oh, who's that?' She said, 'Oh, he's a football player.' She just loved O. J. She didn't care if he was a football player or a dirt digger. They were really great for each other."
They lived together for six years and married on Feb. 2, 1985. That summer he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio. In an emotional acceptance speech, he thanked "my wife, Nicole, who came into my life at what is probably the most difficult time for an athlete, at the end of my career."
And, he added, "she turned those years into some of the best years I have had in my life, babes." She smiled proudly back at him.
Mr. Simpson began a new career. He became a spokesman for Hertz, a football commentator for ABC, then NBC, and an actor. He was earning an estimated $1 million a year. He was on the road several months a year. The daily care of their two young children fell to her.
Wherever Mr. Simpson went, he talked about his wife. "He was very possessive," said Corey La Russo, a professional golfer who caddied for Mr. Simpson at the Riviera Country Club in Brentwood from 1991 to 1993. "He'd say, 'If I ever caught her with another man, I'd kick his ass.' He didn't want to catch anyone with his wife, and he was adamant about it. He put her on a pedestal. He'd say: 'Hey, she's all I need. She's the most beautiful thing in the world.' "
Cory Waldman, a tennis pro in Miami and a friend of Mr. Simpson, said of Mr. Simpson: "He always used to talk about Nicole. He was always in love with her. Nicole was always there -- in the picture."
 
Dream Dissolves But Intensity Lingers
 Mrs. Simpson filed for divorce on Feb. 25, 1992; the divorce became final Oct. 15 that year. The court documents offer a window into their relationship. "By the time I was 19 years of age, we were living together most of the time," Mrs. Simpson said in her filing. "I traveled back and forth between Los Angeles and San Francisco to be with him. I only attended junior college a very short time because respondent required me to be available to travel with him whenever his career required him to go to a new location, even if it was for a short period of time."
She continued: "I have had no other college education, and I hold no college degrees. I worked as a waitress for two months. Prior to that, I was a sales clerk in a boutique. These two jobs are the sum total of my employment experience. I worked on my own as an interior decorator, mostly for respondent and his friends. I no longer have that opportunity."
She described their lavish life style. "We had a full staff to assist us," she said in her filing. "The house was extensively remodeled a few years ago, and no expense was spared to update and modernize the kitchen, pool and other amenities." Every year they traveled to Hawaii, she said. They had an apartment in New York. Back in Brentwood, she had a nutritionist and a personal trainer.
Mrs. Simpson won a $433,000 settlement, as well as $10,000 a month child support. He said he couldn't pay more because he was saddled with the costs of supporting his mother and his two adult children, among others. The settlement was consistent with a prenuptial agreement Mr. Simpson had signed after a seven-month negotiation over the terms.
In addition, NBC that year cut his salary by $100,000. Two fast-food chicken franchises closed in the aftermath of the 1992 Los Angeles riot. And, he said in his filing, he had lost money on some bad investments.
According to his filing, Mrs. Simpson was not using her full abilities to make money on her own. "Petitioner has done nothing but play," Mr. Simpson's filing said, "taking nice vacations, spending time exercising and entertaining and being entertained."
Mrs. Simpson and the children moved out of the mansion, but they didn't go far. They rented a house about a half-mile from Mr. Simpson. A few months ago, after the incident when Mr. Simpson kicked in the door, they moved to a $650,000 town house on Bundy Drive.
David Bursin, a friend of Mrs. Simpson and a bartender at a Beverly Hills restaurant, said Mr. Simpson kept a close eye on Mrs. Simpson after the divorce. "It was common knowledge that he followed her," Mr. Bursin said. "He would show up at places. She would have to calm him down. It wasn't like he was in a tirade. She just didn't want it to escalate. She would go off for a few minutes and then come back." Other friends recalled an occasion when they were drinking coffee at a cafe when Mr. Simpson drove up and glared at their party for a long minute.
In her last months, Mrs. Simpson was reaching for a new freedom, said Dee Dee Burnett, a 24-year-old who said she befriended Mrs. Simpson five years ago when Ms. Burnett was dating Jason Simpson. "O. J. had possessed her, and she was finally able to have her own life," Ms. Burnett said.
Ron Hardy was one of the friends who accompanied Mrs. Simpson on evenings out. "We would go out and have dinner and then dance all night," he said. "Wherever there was dancing, there was Nicole. Five, six, seven songs at a time. She had more stamina than all of us."
All along, behind the walls and high security gates of Brentwood, there was a lot of talk about Nicole and O. J.: They were together, they were apart, they were together again.
"I ran into her six weeks ago at San Vicente Foods," said a woman who lives on the same street as the Simpson mansion. "I hadn't seen her in three years. She told me: 'Did you hear? O. J. and I are getting back together.' I said, 'Oh, that's wonderful.' I took that to mean he had some rehabilitation after what had happened in 1989. She was very happy."
But the reconciliation did not last. "She tried her hardest, and it didn't work," Denise Brown said.
Denise Brown said her sister told her she would never marry again, adding, "She loved him to death."

HEADLINE: Panel's Moderates Say a Compromise Is Near on Health

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 22

 BODY:
Moderate Democrats and Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee approached agreement today on a national health insurance plan that would require people to buy health insurance for themselves and not make employers buy it.
If the three Republicans and five Democrats can agree among themselves, they said, they will present their plan to the 12 other members of the committee on Friday. They said they thought they could get enough votes to have the committee then send the measure to the full Senate. 
 Deadlock in the Finance Committee has presented the most severe Congressional threat to hopes of passing legislation that would insure all Americans. Many supporters of that goal, even those who quarreled with the emerging details of the compromise plan, said today's development was a major step toward the overhaul of the nation's health care system.
Some members of the committee said they had reservations about the proposal but would vote for it anyway to keep the process going.
The Clinton Administration was tentatively friendly to the moderates' efforts. Hillary Rodham Clinton, after meeting with Democratic senators at lunch, told reporters that she would not comment on the proposal because she did not know its details. But she added, "I am encouraged by what I hear is very substantive discussion."
Some Republicans were dubious about reports of progress. Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the minority leader, said he was preparing an alternative plan. "I think we are still a long way from any consensus either in the committee or in the full Senate," he said.
 
Details of Proposal
 While the compromise plan, backed by two leading figures in the health debate, Senator John H. Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island, and Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, was not available in writing, senators and aides described some major features.
The plan would provide subsidies for people who cannot afford to buy their insurance, they said.
In addition, the requirement that people buy their own insurance, an "individual mandate" in the political jargon of health care, would not come into effect until 2002. And it would take effect only if other methods to spread health insurance had not led to either 95 percent or 96 percent of the American people's being insured. One participant in the talks said 95 percent; another said 96 percent. Such methods might include laws to make it easier for small businesses to join together and bargain for good rates, or a ban on excluding people with pre-existing medical problems.
Politically, the moderates' approach tries to meet President Clinton's insistence on universal coverage, while skirting the intense opposition to the means he chose to achieve it: requiring employers to pay most of the cost of their workers' health insurance. Opposition by small businesses has made that approach dangerous to many Congress members.
Senator Breaux said he believed that the individual mandate might never come into effect, because a commission to administer the plan would make regular recommendations on how to increase the number of Americans with health insurance. As a result, he said, it would not be necessary to rely on a mandate.
 
Tax on Some Policies
 Another major element of the plan, first sketched to reporters on Monday by Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, would be a tax of 35 percent or 40 percent on expensive health insurance policies. The tax would raise money for insuring those whose annual income was up to 240 percent of the Federal poverty level, or about $34,000 for a family of four.
Since insurance companies would probably pass the tax on to consumers in the form of still-higher premiums, this tax could induce customers to choose cheaper health insurance plans, which supporters of the plan think would lead to a reduction in the soaring inflation in health care costs.
One element that Mr. Bradley discussed has apparently been dropped. On Monday the Senator said that if 96 percent of Americans were not insured in five years, not only would individuals be required to buy insurance, but employers who did not insure their workers would also be taxed.
That section, a pale imitation of the employer payments required under the President's proposal and the variations on it offered by Senators Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, apparently proved too much for the Republicans in the group. Besides Mr. Chafee, they were Senators Dave Durenberger of Minnesota and John C. Danforth of Missouri.
 
Republican Criticism
 While those three Republicans tried to avoid the partisan shoals that have threatened the bill, some of their colleagues still rejected the notion of government guaranteeing health insurance coverage.
After the Republicans caucused this afternoon, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas said that any plan that got his support and that of most Republicans could not "guarantee anything."
The moderates' effort was discussed at the Republican caucus, and there was no evidence that it picked up allies. But, Mr. Chafee said with a shrug, "they didn't say I was off on the wrong track."
At the same time, the idea of requiring people to buy their own health insurance drew criticism from liberal Democrats. Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota said it did little to help people who lacked the money for insurance.
In the House, Representative Vic Fazio, the Californian who heads the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, sent a memorandum to other House Democrats today criticizing what he called the Republican idea of the individual mandate.
Mr. Fazio urged Democrats to work against the individual mandate and in favor of a bill requiring employers to insure their workers. He said they would be rewarded in the November elections once voters saw that Republicans were more interested in helping business and the wealthy and were "selling out the middle class."
Still, there seemed to be a rickety bandwagon moving forward for the moderates' proposal. Mr. Kennedy said things "look increasingly hopeful." And Mr. Moynihan, who only Tuesday had said that his committee would not start voting on a health insurance bill until mid-July, changed his mind today and said voting would begin on Monday.
In addition to Mr. Breaux and Mr. Bradley, the Finance Committee's moderate Democrats behind the compromise are Senators David L. Boren of Oklahoma, Max Baucus of Montana and Kent Conrad of North Dakota.
 
Action in the House
 Two other Congressional committees were also at work today on health legislation. The House Ways and Means Committee rejected, 23 to 15, an amendment to eliminate abortion services from its version of the bill. Three Republicans joined 20 Democrats to defeat the amendment.
Representative Nancy L. Johnson, Republican of Connecticut and a critic of many elements of the Ways and Means Committee bill, voted with the majority, saying, "It would be a grave mistake to set a precedent of stripping out services from the package because they weren't politically correct. After abortion comes AIDS care; after AIDS care comes sexually transmitted disease care."
The House Education and Labor Committee nearly finished its work on its more generous version of health care legislation and hopes to complete action on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: THE SHAKEN DOLLAR: THE POSSIBLE ACTIONS;
Dollar Steadies Although U.S. Does Not Intervene

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 22

 BODY:
As the dollar rebounded slightly today from Tuesday's record low against the Japanese yen, the United States held back from intervening to shore up the American currency. Instead, the Federal Reserve chairman assured investors that the American economy was as healthy as ever, while the Treasury Secretary warned speculators that Washington would act if they tried to push the dollar down further.
Many market analysts were surprised by the Administration's relatively laid-back behavior today. Some viewed it as a gutsy high-risk strategy to convince the market that the dollar's fall was not justified by economic fundamentals, much like a doctor allowing a patient to heal naturally before trying more drastic intervention. 
 Others viewed the Administration's tactics as the quiet before the storm. There is widespread speculation in the currency markets that behind its poker face and low-key actions, the Clinton Administration was organizing a global rescue plan to prop up the currency by coordinated buying, and maybe even coordinated interest rate adjustments, by all the major industrial powers. Many traders believe the Administration is letting the market settle a bit before it intervenes in order to have the maximum impact.
Still others said they were completely baffled as to what the Administration was doing, but hoped that there was a strategy in place.
Government officials, however, refrained from explaining their thinking. They declined in any way to suggest what might come next if the dollar weakens.
It was a strange day. The Japanese central bank intervened heavily during trading in Tokyo early today to stabilize the dollar-yen exchange rate at just over 100 yen to the dollar, after its brief descent below the 100-yen level for the first time ever on Tuesday. The Japanese do not want the yen to strengthen against the dollar because it makes all Japanese exports more expensive and harder to sell. The dollar has fallen more than 10 percent against the yen this year.
Many investors had expected the United States to at least signal some intervention when markets opened here as well. Instead, the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, who was the first senior official to speak publicly, told a previously scheduled meeting with a Congressional committee that while the central bank could not be indifferent to currency movements, the American economy was very healthy. He did not indicate in any way how the Fed might respond to further dollar weakness.
In particular, he gave no hint as to whether the Fed would raise interest rates for the fifth time this year -- a move that might help stabilize the dollar by making dollar-denominated bonds and bank accounts more attractive. The Fed's policy-making committee is scheduled to meet next on July 5 and 6, though it could act before then if it wanted. Historically, though, the Fed has viewed its mandate as controlling inflation, not controlling the dollar.
"The outlook for the U.S. economy is as bright as it has been in decades," Mr. Greenspan said. "Economic activity has strengthened, unemployment is down and price trends have remained subdued."
Just as the financial wires started quoting currency traders as saying how disappointing Mr. Greenspan's remarks were, President Clinton spoke. Asked about the falling dollar during a White House picture-taking session, Mr. Clinton said: "I talked to Secretary Bentsen again today about it and I think that I would let him speak for us today on it. We agreed on what he will say and what our course will be."
 
Raised Expectations
 That comment raised expectations in the market that a big announcement was coming. Reporters besieged the Treasury Department with phone calls about when Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen would hold his news conference. But several hours passed before the Treasury faxed to financial reporters a rather bland two-paragraph statement in Mr. Bentsen's name.
It read: "I'm concerned by recent movements in the exchange markets. We are carefully monitoring developments. We continue to be in close communication with our G-7 partners, and we continue to be prepared to act as appropriate.
"Ultimately, what is important is the fundamental strength of our economy, and I am very confident in the outlook. We are now in the midst of the first investment-led recovery from a low inflation base in 30 years. And there is increased evidence of recovery abroad. We share with the Fed and with our G-7 partners the common goal of sustaining recovery with low inflation."
The Group of Seven industrial democracies -- Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the United States and Japan -- teamed with nine other central banks to prop up the dollar on May 4, when it also plunged against the German mark and the yen. But while the dollar on Tuesday hit a post-World War II low, the United States and its partners have thus far refrained from engaging in another coordinated round of heavy dollar purchases to prop up the currency.
 
Reaction to Statement
 Reacting to the Bentsen statement, Neal Soss, chief economist at the First Boston investment firm, said: "There must be more to it than this. That is the only way I can explain why they would make such a fuss about a statement coming and then say so little. There must be something they know that is lurking in the background: either another round of interventions or that the Fed will be taking some actions. If not, you really have to worry that this will add to the unconvincing posture in which the United States has found itself in the currency markets in recent weeks."
By the end of the day in late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 101.10 yen, up from 100.30 yen late on Tuesday. Currency traders either were afraid to take another run at the dollar, for fear that Washington would carry out its threat to intervene, or stopped for a moment to take some profits, or were concluding that maybe the currency had been oversold beyond what the economic fundamentals would justify and were pulling back on their own.
Either way, the dollar seemed to stabilize -- for the moment -- without any intervention. But traders noted that all the dollar basically did was stop falling today. Its rebound was so slight that it could hardly be construed as any long-term fundamental reversal in its downward trend. That means another drop could come at any time.
Does it really matter if the dollar goes down further? The dollar is one of the most tangible symbols of the United States, and a precipitous fall sends a certain political signal of weakness about the United States and the current Administration. But the real economic impact of such a drop is ambiguous.
 
Makes Exports Cheaper
 On the one hand, a weaker dollar makes all American exports cheaper, and easier to sell abroad, and therefore helps to reduce the country's huge trade deficit. Many economists attribute the dollar's long-standing weakness to the continuing deficit, and see the lower dollar as a natural response to the trade imbalance.
A cheaper dollar, though, makes things the United States imports from Japan and Germany more expensive, which can increase inflation. But imports are a smaller share of the economy for the United States than they are for many other nations, which has made Washington policy makers somewhat less concerned about the fortunes of its currency than leaders of other countries are about theirs. Furthermore, although the dollar has been falling against the mark and yen, it has actually been stable or rising against most other currencies, mitigating the inflationary impact.
But on the negative side, a weaker dollar can also drive up long-term interest rates. To finance America's trade deficit -- and domestic budget deficit -- the Federal Government has to sell Treasury notes to foreigners, since there are not enough American buyers. But foreigners will not buy Treasury securities if the dollar is falling in value unless they are paid a higher interest rate to compensate for any devaluations. Those higher interest rates that the Treasury must charge then get passed through to the American economy at large, putting a crimp on growth.

HEADLINE: Clinton Says the North Koreans Really May Be Ready for Talks

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 22

 BODY:
President Clinton said today that he was now satisfied that North Korea is willing to freeze its nuclear program temporarily, and he agreed to open comprehensive talks next month in Geneva.
The announcement may ease the tension that has built up in recent months. But it does little more than move the standoff to an unpredictable new stage; it remains unclear whether any progress has been made toward resolving the basic differences. 
 After 15 months in which optimism has several times given way to despair, the President injected a note of caution even as he expressed satisfaction that the two countries could take their dispute over nuclear weapons back to the bargaining table.
"This does not solve the problem, but it certainly gives us the basis for seeking a solution," Mr. Clinton said at a news conference at the White House. He described the agreement as "a very positive development."
After six days of wariness and skepticism, the late-afternoon announcement amounted to a willingness to accept that North Korea's leaders really meant what they said when they told former President Jimmy Carter of their willingness to halt nuclear operations while the talks went forward.
Some of Mr. Clinton's aides had spoken disparagingly of Mr. Carter's performance in North Korea and his assertion upon returning that he believed the crisis to be over. But the President went out of his way today to offer thanks and praise to his Democratic predecessor and what he called Mr. Carter's "important role."
"It is the beginning of a new stage in our efforts to pursue a non-nuclear Korean peninsula," Mr. Clinton said.
In accepting North Korea's commitment as a basis for the new talks, the White House has dropped its demand that the North preserve evidence of its past nuclear operations, which could show whether it has extracted the plutonium necessary to make nuclear weapons. But Administration officials say they still hope North Korea will allow them to learn in detail about the past.
As the basis for their confidence, Administration officials pointed to a letter received in Washington today in which Deputy Foreign Minister Kang Sok Ju of North Korea described his country's willingness to suspend the nuclear activities that most worry the United States.
In return, Mr. Clinton made it plain that Washington would make good on its offer to suspend its push for economic sanctions once bilateral talks are under way. The talks would bring together American and North Korean representatives for the first time since last summer, and would expand and thus complicate a dialogue that has focused almost exclusively on the dispute over nuclear weapons.
Since his return from North Korea, Mr. Carter has been an outspoken advocate of bilateral talks as a likely route to a permanent solution. In interviews, he has pointed to North Korea's interest in obtaining more modern nuclear reactors and in winning Western assurances that it will be spared from nuclear attack as reasons that the North might accede once and for all to Western demands that it open its nuclear plants to international inspectors.
But skeptics inside and outside the Administration have warned that the North may simply be seeking once again to buy time, and Mr. Clinton's announcement was received with particular disdain today by Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader.
Accusing the Administration of an "apparent readiness to throw in the towel," Senator Dole issued a statement warning, "There is no basis in history or experience to believe more talk and more delays will limit North Korea's nuclear ambitions."
But Representative Gary L. Ackerman, a New York Democrat and a leading member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, praised the step as a "very, very welcome breakthrough."
 
Two Key Assurances
 The letter today from Mr. Kang, the Deputy Foreign Minister, was a response to one sent to him on Monday by Robert L. Gallucci, Assistant Secretary of State for Politico-Military Affairs. Mr. Gallucci wrote that Washington would resume talks soon if North Korea confirmed that it was willing to suspend its nuclear weapons program.
Mr. Kang's letter was not made public, but Mr. Clinton said it contained assurances that North Korea would neither reprocess the spent nuclear fuel rods it recently removed from a nuclear reactor, nor reload that reactor with new rods, the main steps Washington had demanded.
In order for the West to verify these assurances, Mr. Clinton said, North Korea also promised to allow international inspectors and their monitoring equipment to remain at the Yongbyon nuclear complex.
 
Looking Toward July 8
 Tonight, Mr. Clinton described the commitment to inspections as the central feature. "If we didn't have some way of verifying it, you and I wouldn't be having this conversation at this moment," he told reporters in the White House briefing room.
United States officials said the talks were likely to begin in Geneva on July 8, the date proposed by North Korea. Mr. Gallucci is expected to be the American representative, Mr. Kang the North Korean.
While nuclear issues will be at the fore, a senior Administration official told reporters in a briefing at the White House, North Korea's rapidly developing missile program may also be discussed.
Securing permission for international inspectors to visit several sites where North Korea is suspected of storing plutonium or conducting secret nuclear programs will be high on Washington's agenda, the official said. Only by inspecting such sites will investigators have any hope of reconstructing North Korea's nuclear program and determining how far they have progressed toward building a nuclear weapon, if at all.
 
Conferring With Allies
 The official said the North Koreans had stated that they would discuss fulfilling their obligations as a signer of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, including allowing inspections of suspected nuclear sites, in the context of an "overall solution."
Mr. Clinton and his top aides began even tonight to consult with allies about how to capitalize on the new step.
While the President called President Kim Young Sam of South Korea from the White House, Secretary of State Warren Christopher was placing calls from his Air Force jet on a flight home from Brussels to his counterparts in Russia, Japan and South Korea.

HEADLINE: Indonesia Shuts Three Outspoken Magazines

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, June 22

 BODY:
An era of relative political openness and press freedom in Indonesia appeared to end this week as the Government of President Suharto shut down three influential magazines, including the country's most prominent newsweekly, and warned other publications that they could soon share a similar fate.
Diplomats and human rights advocates said the closing of the magazines was the most serious blow to freedom of the press in Indonesia in decades and would harm the international standing of the Suharto Government at a time when it seemed to be otherwise improving. 
 The publications are Tempo, which began publication in 1971 and was considered the nation's pre-eminent newsmagazine; DeTik, a year-old magazine praised by readers for its daring investigative reporting, and Editor, another newsweekly. They were notified late Tuesday that their publication licenses had been revoked by the Government.
The United States Embassy in Jakarta, the Indonesian capital, issued a statement expressing "regret over the Indonesian Government's decision to cancel the publishing licenses." President Clinton is expected to travel to Indonesia in November for a meeting of the leaders of Asian and Pacific countries.
Fikri Jufri, editor in chief of Tempo, said in a telephone interview from Jakarta that there was no hope of resurrecting the publication -- "at least not in this regime."
"Tempo becomes history, and I'm surprised and I'm saddened," he said, adding that the move would chill the reporting of other Indonesian publications, a view shared by diplomats and human rights groups.
In their willingness to challenge the Government of President Suharto, who has held power in Indonesia for a quarter of a century, the three publications had no rival among Indonesia's daily newspapers, which are far more timid in their coverage of the Government. News broadcasts on Indonesian television and radio have traditionally been subjected to tight Government control.
The Information Ministry said Tuesday in Jakarta that it closed Tempo after the magazine, which had a circulation of about 190,000, failed to heed several warnings about its news coverage. The director of the ministry's press department was quoted in news reports from Jakarta as saying that recent articles in Tempo "haven't reflected the life of a sound press, a free and responsible press."
The ministry said the other two publications were being shut down for "administrative" reasons involving their supposed failure to operate according to terms of their licenses.
The shutdown of the three magazines appeared to offer new evidence of the growing influence of the Indonesian Technology Minister, B. J. Habibie, a close friend of Mr. Suharto and a possible successor, who was the subject of unflattering scrutiny in Tempo and elsewhere after he arranged the purchase of 39 ships from the former East Germany Navy. The purchase had been opposed by senior officers of the Indonesian Navy.
DeTik, which means a second of time, began publishing in February 1993 and aroused the anger of the Government because of a series of recent articles implicating senior officials and friends of President Suharto in the country's worst banking scandal, a $436 million swindle of Government funds.

HEADLINE: 3 Governors Take Pleas On Aliens to the Senate

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SONTAG, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 22

 BODY:
Armed with metaphors equating illegal immigration with natural disasters, the Governors of California, Florida and Arizona beseeched the Senate Appropriations Committee today for reimbursement for services that their states provide illegal aliens.
The Governors, who have already sued the Federal Government in an effort to recover some of those costs, used a hearing of the committee to restate their alarm at the havoc they see being wreaked by Washington's failure to police the nation's borders sufficiently to stem the flow of illegal immigration. They spoke of storms, floods and tidal waves of illegal aliens. 
 Gov. Pete Wilson of California testified that every fifth grader in his state could have a computer if it were not for the cost of educating illegal aliens. Gov. Lawton Chiles of Florida called for a Federal charge card so illegal aliens could bill their health care and education directly to the Government. And, referring to "the immigrant invasion," Gov. Fife Symington of Arizona noted that the Constitution guaranteed the states protection against invasion.
 
Storm 'Battering Our Shores'
 Mr. Chiles, a Democrat, described illegal immigration as a "living nightmare" akin to Hurricane Andrew. "As surely as the winds and rains of Hurricane Andrew assaulted South Florida in a crisis that forever changed it," he said, "there is another storm, illegal immigration, that is battering our shores today."
The witnesses' rhetoric fell on mostly sympathetic ears. None of the senators on the committee chastised the Governors for antagonizing the Clinton Administration by filing suit. (Indeed, Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, went so far as to wish them victory.) And no one challenged the Governors' immigration-cost estimates, which do not take into account that illegal aliens contribute to the states' economies as consumers, laborers and even entrepreneurs.
But the senators, who themselves did some tough talking on immigration, offered little encouragement about reimbursing the states with Federal money. "Old Mother Hubbard's cupboard is pretty bare," said the committee chairman, Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia.
Mr. Byrd also urged Governor Wilson, a Republican, to stop blaming Washington for so many of California's woes. Singling out a California agency brochure that describes prenatal services offered to immigrant women, the Senator termed it "an open invitation to illegal aliens."
 
Distrust of the Governors
 Advocates for immigrants distrust the Governors' very public campaign to try to recover money spent on illegal aliens.
"They are simply grandstanding," Jeanne Butterfield, the chief policy analyst for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said in an interview. "They are pushing the hot button of immigration at a time when they are facing tough re-elections. Everyone's playing to an audience on this issue."
The Immigration and Naturalization Service estimates that there are 3.85 million illegal aliens in the country. The leading states in this category are California, with 1.6 million, New York (510,000), Texas (405,000) and Florida (333,000).
In calculating the costs of educating and providing health care to illegal aliens, as well as incarcerating those criminally charged or convicted, the states use higher population estimates than does the immigration service. Mr. Wilson said California spent $3 billion a year on illegal aliens, Mr. Chiles said Florida spent $884 million and Mr. Symington, a Republican, said Arizona spent $204 million.
In his budget request for the 1995 fiscal year, President Clinton asked Congress for $350 million to help states defray the costs of imprisoning illegal aliens. But that money has already been swallowed up in the House Appropriations Committee's budget bill by a program of grants to fight drugs. States could elect to use the grant money for prison costs, but, because the money would be spread among so many more states, those grappling with the heaviest immigration burden would receive far less than under the Clinton proposal.

HEADLINE: Drug Cartel Tied to Vote In Colombia

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, June 22

 BODY:
Hoping to buy leniency from the future Colombian President, a Cali cocaine cartel leader agreed to donate $3.75 million to the presidential campaign of Ernesto Samper Pizano, according to wiretap tape recordings made public here today.
Mr. Samper, who won the presidential election Sunday by the narrowest margin in memory here, denied the charges and demanded a police investigation. His campaign treasurer, Santiago Medina, said, "This campaign did not receive one peso from drug trafficking." 
 The No. 2 finisher, Andres Pastrana, played the telephone recordings at a news conference and asserted on national television, "If it is proved that the President-elect's campaign received drug trafficking money, he should resign because his mandate would be invalid."
While some journalists here called the donation offer Colombia's most serious political scandal of recent years, others predicted that it would eventually fizzle out, as have past denunciations of traffickers' influence in politics.
Past incidents that never went beyond newspaper headlines include a 1991 videotape that showed delegates to Colombia's Constitutional Assembly accepting envelopes stuffed with cash from cartel emissaries. The Assembly voted overwhelmingly to bar the extradition of Colombian trafficking suspects to the United States for trial.
 
President Flies to U.S.
 Today, belying a crisis climate, President Cesar Gaviria flew to Los Angeles for the World Cup soccer match between Colombia and the United States.
Seeking to appear presidential, Mr. Samper visited a remote Andean region where an avalanche killed about 1,000 Indian peasants two weeks ago. Both Mr. Samper and Mr. Pastrana plan to travel to the United States on Thursday to follow Colombia's team in the World Cup championship.
Police technicians verified today that the voices on the tapes belong to Alberto Giraldo Lopez, a newspaper columnist, and Gilberto and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela, two brothers who manage the Cali cartel, the world's largest cocaine trafficking organization.
"What a funny thing, the presidency is in your hands," remarked Mr. Giraldo, who appeared on the tape as an obsequious messenger boy for the Rodriguez Orejuela gang.
When Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela grudgingly agreed to donate five billion pesos to the Samper campaign, Mr. Giraldo whined, "In turn, you wouldn't even give me five pesos."
The trafficker replied on the tape: "Yeah, well you can't help us go straight. That fine day when you are a presidential candidate, and you have 47 percent in the opinion polls, you won't get just money, you'll have our lives in your hands."
"We've already talked to Medina," Mr. Rodriguez Orejuela said, apparently referring to Mr. Samper's campaign treasurer. "We'll send around some money on Wednesday, and then the rest around Monday of next week."
Although the dates of the tapes are unclear, the proposed multimillion dollar donation was apparently timed to flow last week, when pollsters were predicting a dead heat for the two candidates.
Playing the role of the intermediary, Mr. Giraldo said, "The important thing is that the five points be reassured, set, taken care of."
Today's issue of La Prensa newspaper, owned by Mr. Pastrana's family, speculated that "points" referred to five nominees in a future Samper Cabinet.
"What's that?" rasped Mr. Rodriguez Orejuela, apparently confused.
To explain, Mr. Giraldo said, "Those are the fundamental nominations."
At the end of the conversation, the trafficker said: "Please don't tell anyone. We aren't dopes. We know how to run our business."
As soon as copies of the tapes started circulating here Monday night, Mr. Giraldo went underground. Today, he openly admitted his role as an emissary for the Rodriguez Orejuela brothers, two men who, in theory, are targets of nationwide manhunts.
 
'My Efforts Were Useless'
 "I suggested to the Rodriguez Orejuela gentlemen that I could intermediate with the candidates' advisers to see if it were possible, without any commitment, deliver economic donations to the campaigns," Mr. Giraldo said in a written statement. Advisers for the two candidates rejected the offer, Mr. Giraldo said, adding, "My efforts were useless."
"Curiously, this part of the dialogue was not published," he continued, implying that Mr. Pastrana edited the tapes.
Denying that the tapes were edited, Mr. Pastrana today gave his account.
On June 15, he said, an unidentified man pressed the tapes into his hands as he was leaving a campaign rally at the Inter-Continental Hotel in Cali. The next day, after listening to the tapes, he delivered them to President Gaviria in Bogota.
On June 17, President Gaviria sent the tapes to Colombia's Prosecutor General, Gustavo de Greiff, and ordered him to investigate their authenticity. The tapes were not made public before polls closed Sunday night.

HEADLINE: THE SHAKEN DOLLAR: THE REASONS;
A Currency Dragged Down by Twin Deficits

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
With all the talk about the United States economy doing well -- so well that the worry is that it may overheat, why is the dollar hitting record lows against the Japanese yen?
To some, the economy may seem like a child who has been diligently doing his homework but still getting a bad report card. The Clinton Administration appears to taking the dollar's plunge that way. 
 But experts, from currency traders to economists, suggest that currency markets are not quite so simple. While the economy is growing -- and the dollar is undervalued by some measures, they say -- America's trade and budget deficits have combined into a considerable force pushing the dollar down.
Another complicating fact is that investors, who have an increasingly global view, have been licking their wounds from market declines earlier this year and have been moving some money in recent months from American to German markets, which are seen as more stable, and to Japanese markets, which may be more lucrative.
 
Conflicting Forces
 Economists note that the value of one currency versus another results from both short- and long-term forces that often push in different directions.
Over the long run, the price of goods, like cars and machinery and corn, that are traded in world markets should equalize across borders. And as countries become more efficient at producing these goods, that improvement will be more or less reflected in the values of their currencies. Such changes go a long way toward explaining why the dollar has dropped so sharply against the yen since World War II, as Japan built its economy and became much more competitive with the United States and other nations. The cost of production in Japan has risen far less rapidly than in the United States.
"The relative price of a basket of American goods compared to a basket of Japanese goods has been going down in real terms since 1950," said Maurice Obstfeld, an international economist at the University of California at Berkeley. "Most people feel that is related to relative gains in Japanese productivity."
Still, some economists said that based simply on the cost of goods, the yen is extremely overvalued. A quick check of prices in a Japanese department store, they say, where an American tourist would pay far more for goods than in the United States, argues that the yen should fall.
 
Supply and Demand
 But at any given moment, currency rates, like any price, are also determined by supply and demand. And in recent weeks, more people have wanted to sell dollars than to buy them, pushing the dollar down against both the yen and the German mark.
The recent decline in the dollar has occurred even though interest rates in the United States have climbed sharply in recent months. This seems to run counter to financial theory that suggests that when interest rates rise in a country, its currency should also gain because investors are paid more to invest in that currency. But this phenomenon is actually a lagging indicator. While rates are rising, the value of bonds falls and stock markets often decline as well.
So, in a global economy, investors shun bonds in countries with rates that are heading up, but they prepare to pounce on those bonds when the rates appear to be at their top. With American bond rates still at historic lows, there is little such sentiment drawing investors to the dollar.
"Rising interest rates are bad for the dollar, but high interest rates are good for the dollar," said John Taylor, president of FX Concepts, a money management firm specializing in currencies.
Ironically, a significant source of the recent selling has been speculative investors, closing out money-losing positions that meant to gain from a rise in the dollar.
"Since the U.S. economy is doing well and the Japanese economy is doing poorly, it looked like the dollar had to appreciate against the yen after its long, long slide," said Klaus T. Said, head of foreign exchange for J. P. Morgan & Company. "Making the dollar-yen bet for speculators and interbank traders was the one sure bet for 1994."
The investors lost money on their positions in February after trade talks with Japan broke down. Somewhat chastened, many speculators kept their dollar investments. But as the dollar fell, they reached their limits for losses and closed out their positions. Mr. Said said that the sentiment among traders may be reversing, though betting that the yen will rise from its current levels is seen as a big risk.
"This year has not been very kind to participants in the forex markets," he said. "The big, seemingly clear trends didn't work out. We're here to make money, and if there is weakness in the dollar, we'll try to capitalize on it."
This said, the speculative investors, like hedge funds and bank proprietary trading desks that had been so influential in currency trading over the last few years in Europe, have maintained a much lower profile. They are using much less leverage and generally looking for conservative, short-term trading opportunities.
And more broadly, most investors are uncertain. The world economy is midway through a lengthy transition from recession and falling interest rates to growth with inflationary fears and rising interest rates. Amid that shift, short-term trends are harder to determine. Traders are less willing to commit themselves. And markets become more volatile.
Historically, the dollar has been a haven for uncertain times, but now the German mark, along with the Swiss franc, appear to some to be a safer choice. The crisis in North Korea has scared some investors. Moreover, there are questions about Washington's resolve to fight inflation.
"There has to be a lot of concern that the disinflationary trend that started with Paul Volcker, will be repudiated over the course of the 90's," said Mr. Obstfeld, the economist.
The German mark, meanwhile, is seen as at least as stable as the dollar. Investors do not have to pay a penalty for that view because short-term German rates are somewhat higher than those in the United States while rates in other European countries are even higher.
The mark has gained after the German central bank indicated that interest rates would probably not be cut further. And support for Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Government in the European parliamentary election reduced worries about political change in the elections in the fall.
"Most people would rather be in Germany because the central bank is more predictable," said Adam M. Greshin, the manager of international bond funds at Scudder Stevens & Clark. "The Fed is an unknown at best."
But at 1.60 to the dollar, the German mark is not seen as abnormally high. It has been as strong as 1.40 to the dollar as recently as September 1992, but it had fallen to 1.76 this February. Moreover, from a purchasing-power point of view, the mark's value is not out of line, many currency experts say.
"If you go to Germany the prices seem normal, but in Japan they are a joke," said Mr. Said, of Morgan.
While the dominant trend among investors has been to become more conservative, some who are looking for higher returns have been drawn to Japan. The Tokyo stock market is up sharply this year, and investors in the United States and Europe have rushed to buy Japanese stocks, for which they must pay yen, thus pushing up the Japanese currency.
And as the American economy has rebounded, the United States has imported more goods from Japan than Japan has taken from the United States, increasing the trade deficit. This has increased the demand for yen, to pay for the Japanese goods.
In the 1980's, Japan invested the dollars it earned from trade in the United States, buying Treasury bonds, real estate and entire corporations. Amid the turmoil in the Japanese economy, the foreign investment flow to the United States largely stopped. Now Japanese companies quickly sell the dollars they earn, converting them back to yen.
Only when Japan chooses again to invest its dollars in the United States or to buy American goods will the dollar rise significantly against the yen, experts say. Japan's central bank appears to be signaling to other Japanese investors that the time is right to move the money overseas by its continued purchase of dollars. Yet it is unclear that the message has taken hold.

HEADLINE: THE SHAKEN DOLLAR: THE GROWING FEARS;
Japan Sees Rise of Yen As Threat to Recovery

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 22

 BODY:
The rise of the yen to its strongest postwar level against the dollar has renewed fears that Japan's export-oriented automobile, electronics and steel companies will suffer another blow to their competitiveness, nipping in the bud Japan's fledgling economic recovery.
The decline of the dollar on Tuesday to below the crucial level of 100 yen brought back nightmares of what happened last year, when a sharp appreciation of the yen extinguished an economic resurgence after the Government declared, prematurely, that the economy had hit bottom. 
 Some economists and businessmen said the dollar had overshot the level at which it should be and would rise again soon. Even if it does not, some said, a slow economic recovery would still be possible for Japan this year unless the dollar dropped as low as 95 yen. Because of the improved economic conditions in the United States and Europe and cost-cutting by companies here, Japan is more resistant to the yen's rise than it was a year ago.
Still, with the dollar having fallen briefly to 99.90 yen in New York trading on Tuesday, piercing the 100-yen barrier, the Japanese appeared in no mood to take chances.
 
'Firm Actions' Promised
 Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata held an emergency Cabinet meeting today on the currency situation. After the meeting, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii promised to take "firm actions" to stem the yen's rise, which he called "bad not only for the nation but also for the world economy."
Japanese auto makers, meeting with Trade Minister Eijiro Hata, called for immediate action to stabilize currency rates.
The Bank of Japan intervened heavily in the market to stabilize the dollar somewhat. In trading here today, the dollar closed at 100.65 yen, its lowest close ever in Tokyo, but still above the opening rate of 100.35 yen.
But economists here said they doubted that the Bank of Japan alone would be able to stem the tide for long unless it was joined by the central banks of other countries. They said Japan had little power to act because what had happened was not so much a strengthening of the yen as a weakening of the dollar against many leading currencies, fueled by fears of inflation in the United States. The solution, they said, might entail raising interest rates in the United States.
"The problem is not the yen; the problem is the dollar," said Ron Bevacqua, an economist for Merrill Lynch in Tokyo.
 
Stabilization Efforts
 Mr. Fujii, the Finance Minister, said after today's Cabinet meeting that Japan was seeking the help of the other industrialized economies to stabilize currencies. He also said the Government would push ahead with efforts already under way to stimulate the economy, such as extending this year's income tax cuts to future years and deregulation.
Other officials said the rise of the yen added to the urgency of Japan's need to reach trade agreements with the United States, because the yen tended to rise when trade relations between the two nations soured.
Makoto Utsumi, a professor at Keio University who was a high-ranking official in the Finance Ministry, said the recent currency movements were the results of speculation, not economic fundamentals, and might soon be corrected. "It is rather counterproductive for Japan to respond to the speculative movement by fundamental policies," he said.
A big concern is what will happen to Japan's export-oriented companies, which have been restructuring to cut costs and moving manufacturing operations abroad to offset the rise of the yen. Many of these companies have trimmed enough that they could live with an exchange rate of 105 yen or 110 yen to the dollar.
 
More Trims Possible
 But if the dollar stays at 100 yen or drops to 95, the companies would return to losing money on exports and would have to trim even more. That would mean a continued decline in capital spending.
The Sony Corporation, for instance, has forecast that its operating earnings will grow by 71 percent in the current fiscal year because of the economic recovery and its cost-cutting efforts. But that forecast was based on an exchange rate of 105 yen to the dollar.
A Sony official said the company was not worried about a short-term dip in the dollar, because it had hedged to cover much of the risk of currency fluctuations. But, the official added, "if the yen stays at 100 or 99 yen per dollar for the second quarter, it will be difficult."
Still, some economists say, Japan's economy is better able to withstand the shock of the yen than it was a year ago. The United States economy is stronger than it was a year ago and Europe is showing some recovery, providing larger markets for Japanese products.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Bonds Post Sharp Gains

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities rose sharply yesterday as a result of a rebounding dollar against the yen and three consecutive days of decline in commodity futures prices.
A stronger dollar and weaker commodity prices helped to ease concerns that the Federal Reserve would need to raise short-term interest rates soon to combat inflation or support the dollar. The Commodity Research Bureau index of 21 commodities dropped 3.42 points yesterday, to 230.87. 
 Earlier in the day, President Clinton announced that Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen would issue a statement on the dollar, and that it would represent the position of the Administration. The bond market took it to mean that Mr. Bentsen would announce a broad package to defend the dollar's value and that seemed to give the bond market a lift.
But Mr. Bentsen, while saying that the Government was prepared to support the dollar, announced no plans to intervene. Mr. Bentsen also said the Government was in touch with the Group of Seven industrial nations about the dollar, and that the Administration continued to share the Federal Reserve's goal of low inflation.
The price of the 30-year bond surged 13/32 , to 8614/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from prices, fell to 7.39 percent, from 7.49 percent on Tuesday. The strong move still leaves the bond in its current trading range.
The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, in an appearance before the House Budget Committee, avoided any mention of the dollar's plunge in his prepared text and refused to answer questions about the dollar, saying the situation in foreign exchange markets was such that he "did not want to get involved" in such a discussion.
Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Securities, who says the dollar is not high on the Fed's priority list, said he believed that "when the Fed moves, it will be strictly for reasons relating to inflation and economic growth rather than to merely stabilize the dollar."
"Interest rates and exchange rates, along with the levels of prices, income and employment, are mechanisms that facilitate economic adjustments," he said. "It may not be wise in a longer-term context to use monetary policy to influence exchange rates, because it would than tend to limit the impact of these tools on economic policy, and as a result put under stress the levels of income and employment as adjustment mechanisms."
The Fed released its so-called beige book summary of business conditions and it had something for everyone. The report showed economic growth had moderated in some areas but that manufacturing was still showing strength and that loan demand was picking up. "It was only interesting if you happen to be coming back from another planet, since most of the data is months old," Mr. Fine said.
 
Treasury Auctions Notes
 In the government market, the Treasury sold $11 billion of new five-year notes through auction and traders said they were relieved that the auction went well.
The note was awarded at a high yield of 6.77 percent, down from 6.78 percent last month, an indication of good demand.
In the tax-exempt municipal market, New York City's Industrial Development Agency is selling $430.6 million of special facility revenue bonds through Smith Barney with a maximum yield of 6.50 percent for an issue due 2024. Yields are 6.45 percent for a bond due in 2019 and 6.40 percent for another due in 2015. Shorter-maturity serial bonds yield from 5.25 percent in 1999 to 6.20 percent in 2009.
The bonds, which are being sold for a Terminal One Group Association limited partnership project, are, for some investors, subject to the Federal alternative minimum tax and are rated A by Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's and A- by Fitch Investors Service.
Yesterday, the Federal National Mortgage Association, better known as Fannie Mae, priced its first global debenture issue ever through an underwriting group led jointly by Merrill Lynch and J. P. Morgan Securities.
The $1.5 billion 10-year global issue was given a 7.40 percent coupon and offered at a price of 99.75 to yield 7.436 percent, or about 25 basis points more than a 10-year Treasury. A basis point is one hundredth of 1 percent.
Both S.& P.and Moody's rate the issue triple-A.
Fannie Mae officials expect more than half of yesterday's issue will be sold to overseas investors. And those investors in 1993 bought about 10 percent of the $46 billion in long-term debt that Fannie Mae issued.
The following are the results of yesterday's auction of new five-year Treasury notes:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)
 
High Yield . . . 6.77%
Low Yield . . . 6.70%
Median Yield . . . 6.74%

HEADLINE: Anticipating Influx of Refugees, Miami Plans Schools for Aliens

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MIAMI, June 22

 BODY:
Concerned that political troubles in the Caribbean might cause a major influx of refugees, Miami's school board today approved a contingency plan that would put the children of aliens into makeshift special schools rather than integrate them immediately into the district's already overcrowded schools.
The plan, which would involve students attending classes in places like shopping centers and movie theaters, has met with resistance from advocates for children who worry that segregation would provide unequal educational opportunities. Others worry that any plan aiding immigrants will lure more to Florida. 
 Dade County school board officials said that they based the plan partly on an assimilation program in San Francisco and that they planned to have the program evaluated by the United States Education Department's office of civil rights to insure that it did not violate the rights of students to have equal public educations. The plan allows for students in the orientation program to apply for waivers that would transfer them to regular schools.
The board vote was not unanimous. One member, Rosa Castro Feinberg, said schools did more than just educate. "They don't just produce school learning and smart kids; they produce Americans," she said. "It is precisely that experience we will be denying under this plan."
The plan was presented by the superintendent of schools, Octavio J. Visiedo, who came to Miami from Cuba in 1961 when he was 9 years old and entered the public school system. "Sometimes they get lost in the regular setting," Mr. Visiedo said of students from abroad.
The plan would be triggered when the daily new enrollment of students becomes 100 more than normal.
During the 1980 Mariel boatlift, when about 125,000 Cubans came to the United States, the Dade schools opened two centers for a short time to absorb about 15,000 new students. School officials, with their eyes on trouble in Haiti and a worsening economic crisis in Cuba, fear that a new influx could be much larger.

HEADLINE: Pledge Made To Give ABC Tax Breaks

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
In the latest pledge of city and state resources to keep a large company in New York City, the ABC Television Network and its corporate parent, Capital Cities Communications, will receive $26 million in sales-tax abatements and subsidized electricity.
Capital Cities/ABC said yesterday that it would use the incentives to invest more than $150 million in new high-technology production equipment for its New York City studios. 
 The ABC network said it would also create 185 jobs in Manhattan over the next two years. It now employs 3,700 in New York City.
The deal, announced at a news conference by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, comes after more than a decade of corporate brinksmanship in which dozens of large employers, ranging from department stores to Chase Manhattan, have received financial incentives to remain and expand in the city.
 
Headquarters Building
 Capital Cities/ABC executives said yesterday that they had never considered moving the company's headquarters or a large part of its production operations out of Manhattan. The company spent $90 million for a new 22-story headquarters building on West 66th Street in the late 1980's.
But considering incentive packages already granted other companies, including NBC and CBS, some form of financial help for Capital Cities/ABC may have been inevitable.
NBC, which had threatened to move its studios to New Jersey, got $100 million in tax breaks and other incentives in 1989. CBS, which had also said it would leave the city, received a $49.5 million package of incentives last year.
"The communications field is one in which we cannot afford to lose our edge," Mr. Giuliani said at the news conference, which was held on the set of ABC's "Good Morning America" in a studio on West 67th Street.
 
Acquired in 1986
 The ABC network was acquired in 1986 by Capital Cities, a New York company with large holdings in local television and radio stations, newspapers and other publications across the nation. ABC has eight studios on the Upper West Side, from which it produces several soap operas, network news and other programs.
In the deal announced yesterday, Capital Cities/ABC promised to keep its headquarters in the city for at least 15 years. Its $26 million incentive package is to include $14 million in savings on power bills from the New York State Power Authority and $12 million in sales-tax abatements on the purchase of equipment.
Network executives said yesterday that the sales-tax abatements were particularly important because they would help defray the $150 million they plan to spend for new high-technology studio equipment.
The equipment, including a new generation of cameras, studio wiring and computers, will be necessary to broadcast the digital signals to enable viewers to receive high-definition television, known as HDTV.
 
Investments in Technology
 Although HDTV is expected to be years away for most Americans since it will require more advanced television sets in home and more detailed regulations, all the major networks are beginning to make large investments in the technology.
ABC executives said yesterday that last fall they approached economic advisers to Mayor David N. Dinkins to request financial incentives. Though those negotiations were incomplete when Mr. Dinkins left office, ABC's request was first considered by aides to Mayor Giuliani in January, officials said yesterday.
In an interview, John S. Dyson, the Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development, who led the city's negotiating team, maintained that the public incentives granted to Capital Cities/ABC were small when compared to the long-term benefits the company would provide in creating new jobs.
By committing itself to a new generation of studios in Manhattan, he said, "ABC is investing in the high-tech future of the city."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar in Rebound vs. Yen; U.S. Support is Anticipated

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar rebounded yesterday from its record low against the Japanese yen, as traders speculated that the Clinton Administration would ultimately act to keep the dollar from falling further.
The United States did not intervene in the market yesterday, surprising many traders. But there was speculation that the Administration was organizing a global rescue plan to prop up the dollar, which had fallen below 100 yen on Monday for the first time since World War II. 
 "It's obvious that the Administration isn't going to sit on the sidelines if the dollar starts sliding again," said Hunt Taylor, managing director of the Reynwood Trading Corporation, a currency trading firm in Short Hills, N.J. "A lot of people expect central bank intervention, and maybe an interest rate increase as well."
A bout of dollar buying by the Bank of Japan during trading in Tokyo also helped the dollar gain, traders said. It rose as high as 101.35 yen in Asian trading, and was quoted at 101.10 yen in late New York trading. The dollar hit a postwar low of 99.90 yen during the day on Tuesday.
The dollar also gained against the German mark, rising to 1.6055 marks from 1.5960 marks.
Words of caution from the Federal Reserve also helped the dollar rebound, traders said. It rose after the chairman of the Fed, Alan Greenspan, told the House Budget Committee that the United States "cannot be indifferent" to the dollar's plunge.
Traders drove the dollar to a postwar low against the yen on Tuesday in part because the Fed was not buying dollars to stem the slide. So far this week only the Bank of Japan has stepped in to rescue the dollar, traders said.
The Administration showed its concern about the dollar yesterday as Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said in a statement that he was "carefully monitoring developments" in the market.
The Treasury orchestrated a huge dollar buying campaign by the Fed and other central banks on May 4 to prop up the dollar.
The dollar tumbled 2 percent against the yen on Tuesday after the Government reported that the United States trade deficit widened 22 percent in April. The swelling trade and current account deficits are among the reasons traders noted to explain the dollar's slide of 10 percent against the yen and 8 percent against the mark so far this year.

HEADLINE: Fed Report Sees a Moderating Economy

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 22

 BODY:
Rising interest rates are beginning to moderate the economy's rapid pace of expansion while wage and price pressures appear to be in check, the Federal Reserve said today.
"Districts report continued economic expansion, although in some areas growth has moderated recently," said the Fed's latest so-called beige book summary. The book is a summary of economic activity in the 12 Fed bank districts culled from interviews with business people, prepared this time by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. 
 The Fed survey, based on interviews before June 14, indicates an expected moderation in activity was setting in since its last survey was issued May 4. At that time, the Fed found "solid economic growth" in most parts of the country.
 
Manufacturing Still Strong
This time, it said manufacturing continued to strengthen in most parts of the country, with orders and shipments rising for most companies except for industries that supply the military.
But it found some slowdown in response to rising mortgage rates amid a generally brisk pace of new-home sales and construction. The survey also found that rising interest rates were causing declines in loan demand in some areas.
As for inflation, the Fed survey said prices for many industrial materials used in manufacturing processes were rising but said competition was curbing price rises for finished goods.
In a similar vein, it found the number of skilled employees needed by factories in some parts of the country was tight but said that wage pressures were moderate "at this point."
Fed banks in Boston, Philadelphia and Dallas said chemicals and metals prices were rising, while Atlanta, Kansas City, Mo., and Richmond reported construction materials prices were increasing.
The bite of more costly credit showed up at several points.
For example, the New York Fed said demand for loans was falling because of higher short-term rates; demand was reported flat in the Atlanta and Philadelphia Fed districts. Loan demand remained weak in California and banks were easing their terms to try to attract business.

HEADLINE: Vast Changes Sought in Electric System

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

 BODY:
The two top officers of the New York Power Authority yesterday presented a proposal for a vast restructuring of the state's electric power system. They would form a single company to operate the thousands of miles of transmission lines now owned by the Authority or by the seven investor-owned utilities around the state and another entity to run the six nuclear reactors in the state.
The proposal also called for the Power Authority to gradually reduce the amount of inexpensive hydroelectric power that it supplies to utilities upstate, and instead to use the electricity to lure job-producing industries there. 
 It recommended using 2 percent of the revenues from hydroelectric projects to support "renewable resources," like solar power, and for electric cars. It also called for severe budget cuts, especially at the authority's two nuclear reactors, which it said must be run more economically or shut down.
The proposals, the result of a three-month study, were contained in a report to the Authority's trustees. The report was offered S. David Freeman, the authority's president and chief executive officer, who earned a reputation for dramatic solutions when he served as chairman of the Tennessee Valley Authority, and by Robert G. Schoenberger, the first executive vice president and chief operating officer.
 
Harsh Words on Nuclear
 Some recommendations, like cutting budgets, could be carried out unilaterally by the Power Authority. Others, like cutting costs statewide by joint management of assets owned by for-profit utilities, would require the assent of those companies, which have always been limited in their cooperation. Still other recommendations would require new law.
One area solely within the Authority's power is its two nuclear plants, which the report assessed in stark terms.
"The harsh truth is that at the moment, our rates don't cover our costs of producing nuclear power," Mr. Freeman and Mr. Schoenberger said.
"The Power Authority must either reduce costs and increase production at its nuclear power plants or shut them down," the report said.
The Indian Point 3 plant, in Buchanan, N.Y., in Westchester Country, has been shut since early 1993 because of operating and management problems. Together with the adjacent Indian Point 2, owned by Consolidated Edison, the plant is at the center of a region more densely populated than any other reactor site in the United States. Its operation has been controversial for years.
 
A 15-Percent Budget Cut
 The Authority's other reactor is the James A. FitzPatrick plant, in Scriba, near Oswego. It is adjacent to the Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation's Nine Mile Point 1 and 2 reactors. The only other power reactor in the state, Rochester Gas and Electric's Robert E. Ginna plant, is near Rochester.
The Authority's trustees received the report but took no action. They are scheduled to take it up at a meeting next Tuesday in Massena, at the St. Lawrence hydroelectric plant.
The two executives called for cutting the authority's budget, now $487 million a year, by nearly 15 percent over the next 18 months. They would reduce reliance on contractors, reduce staff, cut the travel, legal and public affairs budgets, and take a variety of one-time steps, including selling the Thomas Hart Benton murals at the Niagara and St. Lawrence-F.D.R. visitors' centers. (The murals would fetch about $3 million in a gallery, the report estimated.)
A major problem for the authority, according to Mr. Freeman, is that New York State has more electrical power than it needs, and the glut has cut prices. Unlike traditional utilities, the Authority does not have a service territory. It sells its power on the open market, and in some cases is having trouble competing.
The report said that the Authority should do more than compete; it should promote clean-energy sources and energy conservation and stimulate the state's economy.

HEADLINE: U.S. Investments Overseas Benefit From Dollar's Drop

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
The dollar has dropped substantially this year against both the yen and the mark, but for an increasing number of Americans who invest overseas, it has been a real boon. That is because as the dollar has declined against other currencies, investments in overseas assets have become more valuable.
"This is probably a bad time to go to London and pay for a hotel and meal, but if you had some money there, you got a boost," said Mark Headley, director of international investments for Litman/Gregory & Company, an investment adviser in Orinda, Calif. 
 While stock and bond markets around the world have tumbled, currency gains have cushioned the losses for American investors. For example, Germans who invested in their stock market this year lost 12 percent. For Americans, that loss was cut to less than 5 percent because German stocks are worth more in dollars. In German marks, short-term German bonds inched up just 1 percent this year. But translated into dollars, they returned more than 9 percent.
In the few countries with bull markets, currency gains have worked as a turbocharger. The Japanese stock market, for instance, has risen about 18 percent when measured in yen. When that gain is converted into dollars, investors have gained more than 30 percent this year.
"That's really having the wind at your back," said William McBride, international editor at Lipper Analytical Services. "Currency can have a particularly powerful effect in fixed-income, when the currency is rising and interest rates are going down. You don't find it very often, but when you do, you get big gains."
This year the dollar has fallen more than 9 percent against the yen, and almost 8 percent against the mark. But the dollar has risen almost 9 percent against the Mexican peso.
So, currency has hindered as well as helped. Mexico's stock market has sunk 13 percent this year, but because the peso has fallen even further than the dollar, Americans' stock investments south of the border have sunk more than 20 percent. The Canadian dollar has also been a disaster, causing steep losses for bond funds that specialize in North American securities.
Of course, most Americans do not invest directly overseas. Instead, they use mutual funds. While some of these funds specialize in single countries, like Japan, most invest in many markets and as a result feel the effects of different currencies. This muddies the picture a bit, as does the fact that some funds try to dampen the effects of currencies by hedging their holdings, a strategy that can backfire when the dollar drops.
Even so, currencies clearly count. The Vanguard Group's fund that mimics an index of European securities would be down close to 6 percent in Continental currencies, but in dollars it has declined only 1.5 percent. The firm's index fund that invests in Pacific Rim markets has risen about 9 percent in yen, but 15.8 percent in dollars.
Americans' interest in investing overseas has been growing at a torrid pace. Five years ago, there were 59 funds specializing in foreign stocks valued at $7.2 billion; today, 217 such funds hold $83.3 billion of overseas equities, according to the Investment Company Institute, the fund industry's trade association.
The assets of global funds, which can invest at home and abroad, have increased to $53 billion, from $12 billion. And funds that invest in international bonds have risen to $37.3 billion, from $2.8 billion.
 
A New Cascade
 During the second half of last year, investors put as much into international stock funds as they put into funds that kept their money at home, according to figures from AMG Data Services. Americans' appetite for these funds seemed to slow earlier this year, as the markets began to perform badly.
But recently, money has been cascading back into international stock funds, which are getting about a third of all the money moving into stock funds. T. Rowe Price & Company reported a rebound in international stock fund sales, with its Japan fund attracting particular attention.
Renewed interest in international funds is not surprising, given that foreign funds have been doing much better than many of their domestic counterparts. The Lipper Analytical Services index of international funds has edged down 1.7 percent this year through Tuesday, while its index of funds that invest in United States growth stocks has slipped 4.4 percent.
The picture for bond funds is murkier because many worldwide fixed-income funds own a lot of Brady bonds, most of which are issued by emerging nations, Mr. McBride of Lipper said. These bonds have been highly volatile, and because they are denominated in dollars, have not felt any benefit from the recent decline. If they had been in currencies like the peso, the damage could have been worse.
 
Caution Urged
 In any event, world income funds have fallen more than 8 percent this year, while United States Government bond funds have dropped about 4.5 percent.
Though investors tend to chase attractive returns, the experts caution against the temptation. "Moving your money into a Japan fund is a pretty volatile thing to do, since the yen has already moved up very strongly," Mr. Headley said. "It could turn around at any time and weaken 15 percent."
Though in general he recommended diversifying investments by putting money overseas, Mr. Headley said he would be cautious about moving money into international markets now. If any of them dropped 5 percent or so, he said, it would be a good time to move in. For those who have already invested overseas, his advice was simple: "Sit tight."

HEADLINE: Archer Cole, New Jersey Leader For Organized Labor, Dies at 77

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Archer Cole, who spent more than 50 years in the American labor movement, the last 10 as president of the New Jersey Industrial Union Council, died on Saturday at Overlook Hospital in Summit, N.J. He was 77 and lived in Roselle, N.J.
The cause was cancer, his family said. 
 At his death, he was also director of organization and assistant to the president of the International Union of Electrical and Electronic Workers. He helped draft the union's bargaining position for contract negotiations with the General Electric Corporation now under way in New York.
Mr. Cole, a native of New York City, graduated Phi Beta Kappa from City College. Since 1940 he served in many capacities, from shop steward to international representative to secretary to president of District 3 of the electrical workers, which covers New Jersey and New York.
"He was a great labor leader and just a wonderful human being and like a brother to me," said Bill Bywater, president of the union. "His only concern was for working people, and I never saw someone who spent so much time fighting for their interests."
 
Held Trenton Positions
 While Mr. Cole was head of the New Jersey Industrial Union Council, the membership reached 200,000 people.
He also held various public jobs. Gov. Brendan T. Byrne named him to the New Jersey Economic Recovery Commission in 1977. He was then chairman of the state's Employment Security Council through successive administrations in Trenton.
Gov. Thomas H. Kean recruited him in 1984 for a blue-ribbon Commission on Unemployment, which helped to revise the state's unemployment insurance program. He also taught labor studies at colleges, lectured and appeared on broadcast programs on behalf of organized labor.
While attending City College in the 1930's, Mr. Cole worked nights for Western Union. He was a shop steward from 1937 to 1941 before the electrical workers' union made him an organizer in Newark.
Mr. Cole is survived by his wife, Phyllis Salvato-Cole; four sons, Henry, of Upper Marlboro, Md., Fred, of New Brunswick, N.J., Stephen, of Chicago, and Theodore, of New York City; a brother, Jack Cohen of Fairfield, Conn.; a sister, Susan Kissler of Chicago, and four grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Stocks Recover a Bit, Following the Dollar

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
After three punishing sessions in which the Dow Jones industrial average lost more than 100 points and nearly 3 percent of its value, the stock market recovered modestly yesterday as it awaited developments in the wandering course of the dollar and of commodities prices, especially for oil.
The dollar fell on Tuesday to a post-World War II record of below 100 yen to the dollar. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said yesterday that the United States and its allies were monitoring the course of the dollar and would "act as appropriate." 
 Mr. Bentsen was presumably referring to a market intervention of buying dollars to raise the dollar's value. The Federal Reserve and at least 10 European central banks did so on May 4, but the brake in the dollar's fall was temporary. Some currency traders said Mr. Bentsen's statement was too little, too late.
 
 
'Complex Situation'
 Nonetheless, the dollar rose eight-tenths of a yen yesterday, to 101.10 yen, apparently because enough traders were impressed by Mr. Bentsen's statement as well as by overnight intervention by the Japanese central bank to support the dollar.
And the stock market followed. "This is a complex situation," said David Shulman, chief equity strategist for Salomon Brothers, "but for now, the stock market is following the dollar."
The Dow Jones industrial average advanced 16.80 points, to 3,724.77, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 1.75 points, to 453.09. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index rose 3.95 points, to 712.74.
Stock traders still appeared to be largely on the sidelines. Trading volume fell to 251.1 million shares yesterday from 298.7 million shares on Tuesday. Yesterday's turnover was about 15 percent below this year's average daily volume of 295 million shares.
Some technical analysts say the low volume may indicate that selling pressure is dissipating, but other analysts say fewer and fewer potential buyers are willing to commit themselves as the market environment grows more and more complicated.
 
 
'Game of Differentials'
 For example, a strong economy normally translates to a strong currency so, at first glance, the weakness of the dollar is puzzling.
"But the markets are anticipatory," said David DeRosa, a director of foreign exchange trading at the Swiss Bank Corporation. "They see Europe going from recession to turning the corner, and they see the United States going from a very strong economy to just a strong economy. So the dollar falls and the others rise in this game of differentials."
Meanwhile, the United States inflation picture grows more complex. The closely watched Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities fell 3.42 points, to 230.87, on declining futures prices for cocoa, pork bellies and silver.
But the price of oil, which has a greater inflationary effect on the economy than agricultural goods, remains high. After spiking past $20 a barrel on June 17, August crude oil closed down 1 cent, at $19.37 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday.
 
 
Oil Supplies
 Oil prices are rising, in part, because of continued tight production quotas by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and apparent tight supplies of oil in the Midwestern United States. Refineries in the landlocked Midwest are most vulnerable to spot oil shortages because they are farther away from seaports for oil tankers.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.87 point, to 249.97, with advancing stocks outnumbering declining issues by 1,266 to 862. The American Stock Exchange market value index rose 1.35 points, to 433.22.
Of the 30 component stocks that make up the Dow industrials, 20 increased, led by I.B.M., which gained 1, to 62.
The most active stock, at 5.2 million shares, was Microsoft, which fell 1 1/8, to 51 1/2, despite Tuesday's announcement of a legal settlement in its patent dispute with Stac Electronics on important disk-compression technology.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Boeing and Airbus Split Big Order

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, June 22

 BODY:
Splitting a potentially huge purchase between the Boeing Company and Airbus Industrie, Singapore Airlines said today that it had placed orders and taken options for 52 jetliners worth as much as $10.3 billion.
The deal was seen as a blow to the McDonnell Douglas Corporation. 
 More than half of the $10.3 billion figure represented options rather than firm orders. Nevertheless, analysts said Singapore Airlines' large purchase represented a vote of confidence for the long-beleaguered airline industry. "From an airline and airliner provider point of view, it's another indication that the long winter of recession is gradually turning into spring," Wolfgang Demisch, an analyst with BT Securities in New York, said. "It's not overwhelmingly warm yet, but the ice is beginning to break."
Singapore Airlines placed firm orders for 11 Boeing 747-400 jumbo jets, with options for 11 more of the same model. The airline ordered 10 Airbus A340-300E's, with options for an additional 20 of the midsized four-engine aircraft. The Boeing planes will be powered by Pratt & Whitney engines, while the Airbus aircraft will use engines manufactured in France by a General Electric/Snecma joint venture. Airbus is a consortium of Aerospatiale of France, Deutsche Aerospace, British Aerospace and Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A. of Spain.
Today's order exceeded Singapore Airlines' 1990 order of $8.3 billion worth or aircraft, parts and services.
Boeing shares closed up 25 cents, at $48.25, on the New York Stock Exchange. Analysts said the small movement in the stock reflected both anticipation of the deal for several months, and the fact that many of the planes ordered today would not be delivered until the turn of the century.
Deliveries of the aircraft are scheduled for the period from 1996 to 2003, and are intended for growth as well as for replacement of older 747's, according to Singapore Airlines. The airline expects to grow by 8 to 10 percent a year through the decade. The order "is an expression of our faith in the long-term health of the aviation industry and the promising future for S.I.A.," Dr. Cheong Choong Kons, the airline's director, said in a statement. Singapore Airlines, which currently operates 43 Boeing 747's, announced in February that it was evaluating various aircraft and engines to meet its needs for expansion. Singapore's fleet of 63 aircraft also includes 19 Airbus A310's.
"This order complements Singapore's existing fleet," Howard Rubel, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs & Company, said. "It's a nice order in a rotten market, and it demonstrates that the 747 has some continuity beyond the immediately foreseeable future. In a day and age where there's a paucity of orders, an ordinary one becomes extraordinary."
In making today's order, Singapore Airlines retained the right to change its mind. The airline also has the flexibility to convert the optional order to other aircraft types: the Boeing 747-400 options may be converted to any of the three Boeing 777 models, the new twin-engine long-range plane, while the Airbus A340-300E options may be converted to A330's, a twin-engine plane of similar capacity, or A340-200's, which are smaller.
"As usual, Singapore has done a first rate job of negotiating an attractive and very flexible package of bookings without really committing to an unrealistic period of time," Mr. Demisch of BT Securities said. "The main disappointment in this is for McDonnell Douglas, which had also upgraded the MD-11 to be fully acceptable to Singapore and doesn't appear to have even been in contention."
The MD-11 is McDonnell Douglas's triple-engine, midsized aircraft. In order to fly nonstop from Singapore to Europe, both the MD-11 and the Airbus A340 had to be modified to carry more fuel.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Closely Watched Index Falls As Commodity Prices Drop

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Declining prices for commodities ranging from grains to gold caused a steep drop yesterday in a closely watched index of raw materials prices.
The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities, which recently jumped to a three-and-a-half-year high, skidded for the third consecutive day, sinking 3.42 points, to 230.87. The index dropped on declines in grain prices, livestock, cotton, coffee, cocoa, sugar, energy and precious metals. 
 Copper, however, managed to surge.
 "This is not a good day to be a bull in the commodity markets," said Jeff Wilson, editor of the Brock Report, a farm marketing newsletter.
 "A big negative factor is the increased chance of rain across the U.S. Corn Belt for the next five days," Mr. Wilson said, referring to a steep drop in grain prices this week.
 Another factor important to commodity traders, as well as the financial markets, was the stabilization of the dollar in foreign exchange trading. The dollar had tumbled to a record low against the Japanese yen on Tuesday, causing some nervous investors to buy gold. A weak dollar tends to push up gold prices.
"A slightly firmer U.S. dollar after recent sharp losses also contributed to widespread commodity market deflationary trends today," Mr. Wilson said.
 At the Chicago Board of Trade, forecasts for more rain across the Grain Belt this week drove July soybeans down 9.5 cents a bushel, to $6.67. Corn, oats and wheat also fell sharply.
"It's going to take a lot of convincing to get people to buy this market again after the shellacking it's taken," said Steve Bruce, a grain analyst at Geldermann Inc.
Mr. Bruce said previously bullish commodity funds appeared to be pulling out of the market. "Look at meats, there's general commodity liquidation," he said.
The lowest prices for wholesale beef since late 1987 set off selling at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, where live cattle for August delivery fell eight-tenths of a cent, to 62.80 cents a pound, near a six-year low set earlier this month.
The selloff in agricultural commodities means that "inflation concerns appear to be on the back burner for the time being," said Rusty Vanneman, an analyst at Pegasus Econometrics.
The easing inflation concerns also hurt precious metal prices. After rising close to 10-month highs on Monday, gold for August delivery sank $4.80 an ounce, to $389.50 on the Commodity Exchange in New York. July silver declined 22.3 cents, to $5.368.
Bucking the deflationary trend was copper, which rallied on signs of a rejuvenated Japanese economy. September copper rose 1.65 cents, to 113.6 cents a pound at the Comex.

Back to the days of expensive oil? Don't top off your tank yet.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
OIL for $20 a barrel? Is OPEC on the march again?
It would be precipitous to rush to the corner gas station to top off the tank. The surge that has raised crude oil prices by one-sixth in two weeks is largely being written off as a speculative bubble, another symptom of Wall Street's current inclination to discover inflation lurking under every bed. 
 But the oil boomlet is a reminder that the cheap fuel enjoyed by consumers over the last decade is not guaranteed by the laws of economics or nature. Indeed, some experts are convinced that the long-term trend is toward higher prices. "We've turned the corner in the cycle," said Daniel Yergin, the president of Cambridge Energy research Associates.
One recent projection, offered by the business-oriented World Energy Council in London, suggests that oil consumption will press against available supply by early in the next century. And last week the Economist magazine published a lengthy jeremiad explaining why "world energy markets will soon be roiled by surging demand."
Those inclined to such pessimism focus on projected demand from the developing countries. According to the International Energy Agency in Paris, urbanization alone sharply increases consumption, as people abandon animal power for the internal combustion engine and discover the joys of central heating. The I.E.A. believes industrializing countries will increase their energy consumption by 4 percent annually through the year 2010, compared with about 1 percent in the rest of the world.
China, the world's sixth-largest oil producer, has just become a net oil importer. Over all, Cambridge Energy Research Associates predicts, Asia will increase consumption by some eight million barrels by the year 2005 -- as much oil as is currently produced by Saudi Arabia.
There is certainly plenty of fossil fuel left below ground to meet rising demand. A good proportion of it, however, is coal, which emits roughly twice as much greenhouse-inducing carbon dioxide per unit of heat as oil or natural gas. Renewable forms of energy, like hydropower, could yield a lot more power, but at high cost. Likewise nuclear energy, whose future would be bleak even if Chernobyl was still just another anonymous provincial city in the former Soviet Union.
There is also plenty of oil and gas left, much of it extractable at low cost. The catch is that the cheap stuff is almost all in the Persian Gulf, where development and production are largely determined by geopolitics and maneuvering within the OPEC cartel. Figuring how much oil Iran, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia will sell is thus as much "a problem in game theory," as it is a question of supply and demand, notes Dale Jorgenson, an economist at Harvard.
Convinced now that prices are headed up? Morris Adelman, an economist of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, begs to differ. "It's an old story," he says; "industry opinion just doesn't take account of basic economics."
For starters, he is skeptical of the assumption that rapid economic growth in China, India and Latin America will sharply accelerate world demand for oil. As these regulation-hobbled economies modernize, he argues, they are likely to allow energy prices to rise to free market levels, which in turn, will induce conservation of energy. "The more the third world develops," he said, "the less it acts like the third world."
Then there is the question of energy supply from outside the Mideast. Lots of oil remains to be found and extracted in Russia, China, Colombia, Mexico, Vietnam and even Australia. And while capital for investing in these new areas is not plentiful at the moment, Mr. Adelman is confident that countries yearning for oil royalties are growing more realistic about sharing the risks of development with the international oil companies.
Despite differences in opinion about the future of the oil market, it is possible to find some common ground. Almost no one is predicting a rerun of the 1970's oil shocks anytime in the foreseeable future. By the same token, almost everyone agrees with William Hogan, an economist at the Kennedy School at Harvard, "that the combination of low prices and rising demand can only be sustained over the next few decades with the cooperation of the Persian Gulf producers."
In essence, then, the key difference between the optimists and the pessimists is how they expect the low-cost producers in general and Saudi Arabia in particular to behave. Mr. Adelman doubts that the Saudis have the will or the way to follow a high-price strategy. Mr. Hogan doubts that Mr. Adelman or anyone else can predict the oil producers' response to current events. "With cartels," he said, "we just don't know what we're talking about."

HEADLINE: As Drought Looms, Farmers In California Blame Politics

BYLINE: By DAVID MARGOLICK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: FIREBAUGH, Calif.

 BODY:
A few hundred yards from the Edmund G. (Pat) Brown Aqueduct, an old cotton trailer sits alongside Interstate 5, which slices through the parched hills and verdant rectangles of California's San Joaquin Valley. The wire mesh wagon is empty, and over it is draped a large green banner.
"NO WATER, NO FARMING. NO FARMING, NO FOOD," the sign says. It is one of several along the highway between Los Banos and Bakersfield, in letters large enough to be seen by motorists on the Interstate, the main artery between Northern and Southern California. 
 This year, as the sign suggests, the rains have once again stopped falling on California, the nation's largest producer of fruits and vegetables, and a drought watch has been declared in what water officials say will be one of the century's driest years.
But the members of the Central Valley Family Farm Alliance, which is responsible for the banners, are not imploring the heavens for rain, though that would be nice. What frustrates them are not the acts of God but those of politicians, bureaucrats and environmentalists.
California's mountain reservoirs remain nearly 90 percent full, a reflection of last year's heavy rains and conservation efforts. But farmers in the Central Valley, particularly on its more arid western side, are receiving only a fraction of the water they generally receive from Federal and state sources, in some cases only one-third, and their livelihoods are drying up along with the land.
The state's farmers have always received the largest portion of California's limited water supply, usually about 80 percent of it. But recent Federal environmental regulations have mandated that billions of gallons of water be withheld in rivers and streams to protect the dwindling supply of winter-run salmon, delta smelt and other fish decimated by the dams and water diversions of the Federal Central Valley Project.
The Endangered Species Act stipulates that large amounts of water be released from reservoirs into rivers and allowed to flow out to sea, and the Central Valley Improvement Act of 1992 will commit more water to restoring fish and wildlife and their natural habitats.
The farmers contend that the Government has broken its covenant to provide them with the water they need and has thus produced a man-made drought, impervious to natural cycles.
"A drought is O.K.; we can handle a drought," said Jim McLeod, 65, who has grown apricots and walnuts in Tracy, 65 miles east of San Francisco, for most of his life. "But this new drought is an environmental drought, a political drought, not a Mother Nature drought. The Government wanted a good, reliable source of food, and we did it. We're eating better than anybody in history. And now we're destroying it."
To conservationists, however, the changes in water allocation corrected a long-term imbalance that allowed farmers to waste heavily subsidized water on some crops and to grow other crops ill-suited to the arid terrain. The newly struck balance, these people believe, atones for environmental hubris in California -- a state that "has gone to extravagant lengths to deny that it is a desert," Marc Reisner, the author of "Cadillac Desert: The American West and Its Disappearing Water" (Penguin Books), has written.
Fishermen said the historical imbalance has crippled the state's once-thriving fishing industry. "A lot of us feel the water was stolen," said Zeke Grader, executive director of the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen's Associations. "Fish is a food product, too."
Officials say the tug of war is a reminder of the political complexity of water, an issue that historically pitted farmers and cities against conservationists but over which farmers now stand largely alone.
 
Few Signs of Drought
 "The pendulum has shifted quite abruptly, and they've not had the time to make the adjustment," said Douglas P. Wheeler, the state secretary of resources.
Farmers concede their power is eroding. "The scary thing is the transition between now and then, and the number of people's lives that get trampled in the process," said Jason Peltier of the Central Valley Project Water Association, a growers' group in Sacramento.
Driving into Firebaugh, a sun-baked agricultural community of 5,000 about 120 miles southeast of San Francisco, there are few signs of any drought, natural or legislated. Fields of onions and garlic destined to become powdered condiments and fields of tomatoes earmarked for ketchup and pizza sauce shimmer in the late afternoon sun, nourished by sprinklers spitting out what was once the mountain snow pack.
But here and in surrounding towns on the west side of the San Joaquin Valley, where only five-and-a-half inches of rain fall in an average year, hundreds of thousands of acres that once produced cotton, tomatoes and cantaloupes have reverted to sagebrush and tumbleweed.
Chris Hurd, who grows almonds, onions and cotton, said that 600 of his 2,000 acres near Firebaugh lie fallow this year, and that his property has lost half its value since 1989. "I'm only hiring the minimum amount of people because I don't want to turn around and lay them off," he said. "I have no long-range plans, except three things: no risk, no debt, no growth."
Asked to predict the area's future, Mr. Hurd, 43 years old, replied: "More and more depressed. More and more foreclosures. People migrating out."
In Firebaugh, named for the Scotsman whose ferry forded what was once the San Joaquin River and is now a riparian corpse, unemployment, mainly of migrant workers, stands at 43 percent. At least a third of that is attributable to diminished water, contended Dr. Marcia Sablan, the town's Mayor.
A riot broke out last summer when hundreds of job applicants descended on the N. T. Gargulio tomato-packing plant in Firebaugh. Last year, for the first time, federally financed housing for migrant workers did not fill up.
Fifteen years ago, the town had 20 bars; now there are 3. And as Louis Thomason, the John Deere dealer, and John West, who handles Case-International tractors, are having trouble selling equipment, Firebaugh is losing a major source of sales tax. "I don't think the town will ever go back to the boom era of the 60's and 70's," Dr. Sablan said.
 
An Urban Shift
 For California agriculture, the mid-20th century was a time of plenty. There was plenty of political power, plenty of profits and plenty of water, once Federal and state authorities channeled it from one end of the state to the other. The Central Valley Project, begun in the 1930's, evolved into an intricate network of dams, reservoirs, pumping stations and canals: 600 miles of silver ribbons bringing water to 20,000 farmers and three million acres of once arid land.
But agriculture's influence here has diminished greatly. The state is increasingly urbanized, with fewer financial or sentimental attachments to the land, particularly to the huge agribusiness holdings of the Central Valley.
As Californians have concentrated in cities, they have come to care more about the country. Urban interests, which once joined with farmers to build more dams, now align themselves with conservationists.
"We concluded that the environmental problems are real, and that you don't have to ruin the California economy to solve them," said Timothy H. Quinn of the Metropolitan Water District, which serves Los Angeles. "We don't think the core of the problem is that we haven't poured enough concrete."
 
The Fish Story
 Nowadays, the pumps that once lifted water over the hills of Central and Southern California are running at only partial capacity; horsepower has been replaced by fish power.
The Central Valley Project Improvement Act of 1992, signed by President George Bush over heated opposition by Gov. Pete Wilson of California, will channel between one-fifth and one-sixth of project water to rivers, estuaries and habitats in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta for the restoration of fish and wildlife.
Still more could be diverted under more stringent water quality standards promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency last December that will require that additional fresh water be flushed through to reduce salinity in the delta.
Mr. Wilson denounced those standards, which he said threatened the state's agricultural economy, and asked state officials to devise an alternative. Last month, at the behest of farmers in the Western San Joaquin Valley, a Federal judge in Fresno enjoined enforcement of the Central Valley Improvement Act. Both topics were discussed at a hearing yesterday of the subcommittee on water and power of Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, whose chairman is Senator Bill Bradley.
 
A Partisan Issue
 The conflicting demands of California's farmers, conservationists and cities could become an issue in this fall's election, though water clearly flows across party lines. Environmentalists feel betrayed by Mr. Wilson, who appealed for their support during his 1990 campaign and is running for re-election now. "He essentially turned his back on most of the environmental community," said Tom Graff of the Environmental Defense Fund in Oakland.
But they are not yet comfortable with Mr. Wilson's Democratic rival, State Treasurer Kathleen Brown, whose father was an architect of the state water system and whose brother, Edmund G. Brown Jr., pushed unsuccessfully for the Peripheral Canal, a mammoth public works project that would have diverted yet more water from the delta.
Over the last 10 years, 100,000 acres in the Central Valley have been converted from grains, barley and other water-thirsty crops to more efficient row crops like tomatoes or melons. Farmers have also improved irrigation.
Phillip L. Isenberg, a Democratic state assemblyman from Sacramento and an authority on water policy, called the dispute "one of last gasps of an agriculture-dominated society."
"The world that they, their grandfathers and great-grandfathers knew," he said, "isn't around anymore -- and can never return."

HEADLINE: Korean Talks: Looking for Options

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 24

 BODY:
Now that the North Koreans and the United States have finally agreed to hold high-level negotiations, the Clinton Administration confronts a difficult problem: defining what the talks are supposed to accomplish and how.
The agreement to hold the talks, and North Korea's agreement to freeze its nuclear program as long as the negotiations are under way, has removed the immediate sense of crisis and reduced tensions on the Korean peninsula. It has also enabled the White House to focus again on its domestic agenda and to insulate the Administration from charges that it is allowing the North Korean nuclear program to proceed apace. 
 But while the Administration has defined its goals to prevent North Korea from becoming a nuclear power in broad terms, officials concede that Washington must still confront a number of critical issues between now and when the talks resume in early July.
"A lot of work has been done, but we need to take a fresh look at the issues on the table," said a senior Administration official. "We need to look at both sides of the equation: what we want to see from the North and what we are willing to do on our side."
 
Problems and Benefits
 These are some of the key issues:
*How does Washington make the temporary freeze of the North Korean nuclear program, which was agreed on this week, a permanent one?
*How hard does Washington press the North Koreans to learn about its past efforts to divert plutonium? North Korea has already destroyed the best evidence about its past plutonium production.
*What financial and diplomatic benefits does Washington offer in return? The North Koreans say they want light-water reactors, but the Administration has yet to work out a plan detailing which nation might provide the nuclear technology and who would pay for them. Washington also has to decide how to respond to the North Korean demand that the United States formally pledge not to use nuclear weapons if fighting breaks out.
The resumption of the high-level negotiations, which will be held in Geneva, has been under discussion for months.
 
Looking at Possibilities
 North Korea had long offered to freeze its nuclear program if the talks were held. Until last week, however, the Administration believed that a freeze was not a sufficient basis for resuming the negotiations, insisting instead that North Korea preserve evidence that would reveal any prior diversion of nuclear material.
But with the North Koreans poised to leap forward on the nuclear front and the Administration confronting resistance in marshaling economic sanctions, the White House decided to see if former President Jimmy Carter's visit to Pyongyang offered a possibility for a breakthrough.
In seeking the talks, the Administration is not proceeding on blind faith. It received North Korean assurance that it will agree to a "verifiable" freeze on key elements of its nuclear program.
Under the freeze, the North Koreans will allow inspectors to monitor the nuclear fuel it has removed from its Yongbyon reactor and put in a cooling pond. They also promised to refrain from reprocessing the fuel to make plutonium and pledged not to reload the reactor.
But the North Koreans have only promised to freeze their program through the next round of the high-level talks. Also putting pressure on Washington is an important technical consideration.
The nuclear fuel rods that the North Koreans have removed from their reactor are in a cooling pond. The rods are covered with a magnesium oxide cladding that deteriorates over time. American officials fear that the North Koreans may insist after the round of high-level talks that the rods be taken for safety reasons to their reprocessing plant.
 
Concern Over Fuel Rods
 Nations that have joined the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty are allowed to reprocess spent fuel and produce plutonium if it is done under international controls.
Administration officials say that it may take six months to a year before the rods have deteriorated to the point where they have to be moved. And some advanced nuclear nations, like Britain, have learned how to keep the rods in ponds for years.
But the North Koreans told Selig Harrison, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who recently visited North Korea, that the rods need to be removed in about two months.
The concern over the fuel rods has raised some key questions: how much negotiating capital does Mr. Clinton want to expend to prevent the North Koreans from expanding their program, and how much to determine the amount of plutonium it diverted in the past years? And if progress is made, what happens to the fuel rods?
The issue of how much emphasis to put on past diversion of plutonium already divides Pentagon officials, who are most concerned with preventing the North Koreans from making new bombs, and State Department officials, who stress the need to strengthen the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty by uncovering the exact state of the North Korean program.

HEADLINE: Emerging Plan Is Still Costly, Still Complex

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 23

 BODY:
The health care proposal being developed within the Senate Finance Committee, like President Clinton's plan, is technically complicated, difficult to administer and expensive, health policy experts said today.
The proposal relies on changes in insurance regulations, taxes on some businesses, subsidies to low-income people and a provision that could require people to buy insurance if they did not get it through their employers. 
 The new proposal, devised by conservative Democrats and moderate Republicans, calls for Federal regulation of health insurance practices and other changes to make insurance more available. If more than 5 percent of Americans -- about 12 million people -- still lacked coverage in the year 2002, an independent agency would recommend further steps that Congress could take to provide coverage for them.
If Congress did not act within six months of receiving those recommendations, an "individual mandate" would go into effect, requiring people to buy insurance for themselves. The Government would subsidize premiums for people with low and moderate incomes. The subsidies would be financed, in part, by taxing the insurance benefits offered by the most generous employers.
Concerns about the proposal fall into several areas.
COUNTING THE UNINSURED It sounds easy, but no one has a reliable way of counting the people who have no health insurance. The Census Bureau does an annual survey, but it is flawed because people surveyed often do not distinguish between being without coverage at a specific time and being without it for an entire year.
Moreover, health policy experts say, if people are required to carry health insurance and there are penalties to enforce that requirement, they will have a strong incentive to say they have coverage even if they do not.
TAXES The proposal under discussion in the Finance Committee would impose a new Federal tax on "high-cost health insurance plans." But tax lawyers say it is very difficult to measure the cost and value of health benefits. Costs vary with the age of the worker, family size, place of residence and other factors. Medical care for older blue-collar workers in high-risk industries like mining is more expensive than care for young white-collar workers in safe, clean industries like data processing.
The new taxes would almost surely be passed on to consumers, economists say. Moreover, a tax on high-cost plans would often be a tax on traditional fee-for-service medicine, which tends to be more expensive than health maintenance organizations. Such organizations provide care for a fixed monthly premium but often limit the patients' choices of doctors.
SUBSIDIES Insurance for a family can cost $4,000 or $6,000 a year, and if subsidies were not large enough, people would be unable to afford it. However, if the subsidies were generous, they would be expensive for the Government. It is not clear that backers of the new proposal are willing to spend the amounts needed.
Further, if the Government offers substantial subsidies but does not require employers to buy insurance for workers, it creates a strong incentive for employers to drop coverage they now provide, experts say. That would raise the cost of the subsidies even further because more people would need them.
Marilyn Moon, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, said, "The success of this proposal will rise or fall on the generosity of the subsidies."
Joshua M. Wiener, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, explained: "If subsidies are limited to very low-income people, you don't solve the problem of the uninsured. If subsidies are not so limited, they become very expensive, and it will be attractive for employers to drop coverage. Employers will ask why they should pay for health insurance if the Government will pay for it."
The proposal being developed in the Senate Finance Committee would provide subsidies to people with incomes 2.4 times the official poverty level. For a family of four, the income ceiling would be $35,433 a year.
The proposal to require people to buy health insurance if coverage does not reach a specified goal is known as a trigger.
Richard I. Smith, director of health policy at the Association of Private Pension and Welfare Plans, a trade group composed mainly of Fortune 500 companies, said: "In all likelihood, the triggers would be pulled. Voluntary efforts are unlikely to get coverage up to 95 percent, unless the subsidies are extremely generous and hence expensive."
One purpose of the changes in regulations contained in the proposal is to make insurance more affordable for small businesses. But there is no guarantee such a result would occur. Mr. Wiener, a health policy expert at the Brookings Institution, said, "If you reform the health insurance market so that everyone can get coverage, many sick and disabled people will come into the insurance pool, raising the price." If premiums rise, healthy young people may drop their coverage.
William S. Custer, research director of the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a nonpartisan organization whose members include businesses and labor unions, said, "Premiums may go up for small employers who already have insurance if you put them in a pool with nonworkers and Medicaid recipients," who tend to have higher health care costs.
President Clinton's proposal would require employers to pay at least 80 percent of the cost of health insurance for their workers. Employees would pay a maximum of 20 percent. The Finance Committee group would not require employers to pay anything; the employees' share could be much more than 20 percent, and the cost of Government subsidies could grow accordingly.
Subsidies under the Clinton plan would cost more than $100 billion a year. Under the proposal emerging from the Finance Committee, the subsidies would presumably be more expensive because employers would contribute less.

HEADLINE: Caterpillar Tries to Fill Strikers' Jobs

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: EAST PEORIA, Ill., June 23

 BODY:
Managers, supervisors and other white-collar employees of Caterpillar Inc. began toiling on assembly lines this morning, confident that they could build at least a few engines, bulldozers, road graders and other heavy machines while the company's 14,000 union workers were on strike outside.
On the picket lines, members of the United Automobile Workers were openly contemptuous of Caterpillar's ability to operate factories long without them. About a dozen plants are on strike. 
 "It would take someone two years to learn how to operate my press," said Rocky Dewitt, 44, explaining how he adjusts 20 tons of pressure to turn powdered metal into a solid part. "The last time they tried this, the foremen wrecked some of the machines. No way unskilled people can put out quality parts the way we do."
His statements fit the tone of more than two years of labor-management acrimony and work stoppages. On Monday, union members walked off the job over working conditions and compensation. Both sides were posturing a bit, trying to improve morale in the face of what labor and union spokesmen concede could be a long strike after a short negotiating session among the U.A.W., Caterpillar officials and Federal mediators in Indianapolis made no progress.
"Most labor conflicts are controlled conflicts," said Harry Katz, a professor of labor relations at Cornell University. "This looks like it could be a fight to the death."
 
Bitter History
 Caterpillar has had miserable labor relations for decades, experiencing 14 strikes with its last 16 labor contracts. Relations have sunk to a new low in recent months as union workers and supervisors have increasingly wrangled over incidents of petty harassment, work slowdowns and displays of union activism on the factory floor.
By assigning engineers and accountants to do the work of assembly workers, Caterpillar is trying to demonstrate that it is strong enough to operate despite a strike. Indeed, 1993 was a banner year financially, and the board recently doubled the dividend on common stock. By hiring new workers and inviting striking workers to cross the picket line, Caterpillar may exert enough pressure on U.A.W. leaders to force them to negotiate economic issues that will lower labor costs and allow the union to save face.
In 1991, Caterpillar raised the idea of two-tiered wages to save money for the company. Some workers would be paid about $8 to start, compared with the current minimum of $17 an hour. Caterpillar also wants to spend less on medical benefits by having employees join a preferred-provider plan. That type of insurance costs less than plans that allow free choices of doctors and hospitals.
In making that proposal, Caterpillar was rejecting the standard contract signed by other equipment manufacturers, a move that stunned labor relations experts and brought on a bitter five-month strike in late 1991. During that strike, it operated factories with management workers and some union members who crossed picket lines. Caterpillar also began accepting applications for replacement workers, badly frightening union workers and encouraging the union to call off the strike in the spring of 1992.
 
Debate in the Senate
 Current law permits the hiring of replacements during a strike over economic issues but forbids replacement workers in strikes over unfair labor practices. The Senate is set to debate a bill, strongly supported by unions, that would also forbid the hiring of replacements during strikes over unfair labor practices. A Peoria Journal Star editorial this morning questioned whether the Caterpillar walkout might have been timed by the union to coincide with the Senate debate, an idea a U.A.W. spokesman dismissed as "ridiculous."
The prospect that Caterpillar may once more move to replace union workers has caused the union to portray the current walkout as a dispute over unfair labor practices, not over compensation or pattern bargaining, the practice of negotiating one standard contract for all companies in an industry. "All you do is wear a little button and the foremen tell you to stop doing union business," said a picket who declined to give his name. "They're like the communists."
Terry Thorstenson, a Caterpillar spokesman, said the company was hiring permanent workers. But he has been careful not to use the word "replacement," he said. An increasing number of union workers have crossed picket lines since Tuesday, he said, when it was estimated that 26 percent of the 7,500 workers in the Peoria area had shown up for work. The company has declined to provide numbers since then.
A U.A.W. spokesman disputed Mr. Thorstenson's estimate of how many had crossed the picket line. "They're backing off the numbers game. We are rock-solid."
Mr. Thorstenson accused some workers of mischief designed to disrupt the plant, but the union denies that.

Skippy Maker Follows Crowd and Revamps

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
CPC International Inc., the maker of Skippy peanut butter, said yesterday that it would take a pretax charge of $227 million in the second quarter to close several plants and cut its work force by 2,600 people, or nearly 7 percent.
CPC, which also makes Hellmann's mayonnaise, Thomas' English muffins and Knorr soups, said the cost of the revamping after taxes would be $137 million, or 92 cents a share, and would not change the company's expected earnings for the year. 
 The moves come as many of CPC's competitors, like the Sara Lee Corporation, the Procter & Gamble Company, and the Quaker Oats Company, have also announced reorganization plans. Like them, CPC is healthy -- its earnings grew by 6.1 percent last year before adjustments for several one-time charges -- and the economic recovery in both the United States and Europe should increase its sales this year. But CPC insisted that it must cut costs to remain competitive.
"We see the business improving," Charles R. Shoemate, chairman and chief executive of CPC, said in an interview. "But we also see a very competitive industry where everyone is trying to improve."
Several industry analysts agreed. "They are not doing this because earnings are going south, but because they want to make sure that they will continue to go north," said Nomi Ghez, an analyst for Goldman, Sachs & Company.
Ms. Ghez said that despite some recent factory closings, including six in the United States during the last four years, the company still had more than the number of manufacturing operations in Europe and the United States than was justified by the anemic sales growth and rising competition in those markets.
"It's essentially a slow-growth business," Ms. Ghez said. "I would not be surprised to see more food companies taking restructuring charges in this environment."
Mr. Shoemate said the bulk of the job losses would come from the company's two biggest units: the consumer products divisions in the United States and Europe. A CPC spokesman said the cuts would be in rough proportion to the geographic distribution of the company's global sales.
About 40 percent of CPC's $6.7 billion in revenue last year came from Europe, while 36 percent came from the United States and 17 percent came from Latin America. The company, based in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., has bakeries in the Bronx and Greenwich, Conn., as well as three other plants and a research and development operation in New Jersey.
Mr. Shoemate said the lowering of trade barriers in North America, South America and Europe had also been a catalyst for the reorganization. As a result, he said, the company can consolidate the production of various product lines across borders rather than make the same item in several different countries.
About two-thirds of the charge for the reorganization will be used to write off assets, including some plant closings, during the next 18 months to two years. The remaining money will be used to reduce the staff of 39,000.
Shares of CPC were unchanged, at $50.875, on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday.
In the past, Mr. Shoemate has expressed frustration that CPC's share price was not higher even though the company's financial performance was positive. In the interview yesterday, he said he had been satisfied with the stock's performance during the bear market this year. But he also said he expected to lift the company's earnings above the current position, near the middle of CPC's main rivals in the United States food industry.

HEADLINE: Council Chief Wheels and Deals, And New York's Budget Is Passed

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
In the hours before the City Council voted yesterday to approve New York City's new budget, Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone invited a number of his fellow Democrats into his City Hall office. One by one, he beseeched them to ignore their misgivings and to support Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's austere $31.6 billion budget.
But he did more than plead. To some he promised perks for their districts; to others assignments to prestigious committees. And to those who still resisted, he promised a brand of rebuke only the Speaker himself could unleash -- loss of money for their districts and perks for themselves. 
 The strategy paid off handsomely, and the Speaker won a 43-to-8 victory, with only 8 of the Council's 44 Democrats opposing a budget that largely reflected the priorities of the city's new Republican Mayor.
As Speaker, Mr. Vallone controls a $4 million discretionary fund that finances community-based organizations in members' districts and adds to his persuasive powers. Each member who supported the budget received at least $80,000 from the fund. Those who voted against it received about $50,000.
In addition, he parceled out several millions more for small construction projects in the district. Also, Council members said the Speaker's staff had made clear that committee chairmanships -- which can add anywhere between $2,000 and $24,000 to their annual base salaries of $55,000 -- were also at risk with a vote against the budget, although no Council members have yet been stripped of their positions.
Mr. Vallone insisted that the payments were not used to penalize opponents but rather to reward supporters. "But that doesn't mean that if you vote against the budget, you're going to be rewarded," he said. "The only thing that makes a political party work is loyalty. It has to stand for something. And of course you're going to be rewarded with political perks."
One of those being rewarded yesterday was Lloyd Henry, who represents East Flatbush, Brooklyn. When the budget was being considered, he had deep misgivings about how heavy the cuts would fall on his mostly black, working-class constituents.
"I was being lobbied from all sides," he said. "The unions wanted a no vote and the Speaker's staff, of course, wanted me to go along with them."
What persuaded Mr. Henry to vote for the budget were promises by the Speaker's staff for an additional $52,000 for senior-citizen and youth-service centers in his district, plus the promise of added money for a Caribbean cultural center at Medgar Evers College.
"As a junior member of the Council who was just elected last year, I wanted to be able to bring something back home to my district," Mr. Henry said. "By voting no, I risked losing everything at my first time at bat."
 
Much Soul-Searching
 Even so, there was much soul-searching among Council Democrats yesterday as they pondered their reasons for supporting a budget that, even they acknowledged, could cripple some of the basic services that their neediest constituents depend upon.
And the lopsided vote left many Council members and Democratic officials outside of City Hall questioning whether Mr. Giuliani would face any significant opposition in the future.
"It says that, as Democrats, as a counter-voice to Mayor Giuliani, we're in trouble," said Joan Griffin McCabe, a Councilwoman from Brooklyn, who was one of the eight Democrats who voted against the budget. "It says that many of my colleagues need to recognize the responsibility we have been charged with and, as a group of Democrats, we are missing it big time."
In their speeches on the floor of the Council chamber before the vote, many liberal Democrats voiced clear disdain for a budget that slashes funds for public hospitals and social services while leaving the Police Department untouched. They included the overwhelming majority of the Council's black and Hispanic caucus, who only a few months ago stated firmly that they would not support a budget that hurt their constituents.
 
'Difficult Decision'
 In supporting it, many maintained that it was one of the most agonizing decisions of their legislative careers. "It was a tremendourly difficult decision for me," said Una Clarke, who represents part of the Flatbush and Crown Heights neighborhoods in Brooklyn. "But for the residents of my district, a no vote would have been an irresponsible act on my part."
To Mr. Vallone, the political maneuvering in the budget vote is an annual drama, a test of his ability to display unity among the Council members and a means of demonstrating to the Mayor -- whether a Republican or a Democrat -- that the Speaker is a major force in the city's leadership who can command the allegiance of the Council on votes he considers crucial.
"This is what I consider a key institutional vote," Mr. Vallone said in an interview yesterday. "It sends a message to the Mayor and to the city that despite our grievances, we can put aside our differences in party, in color, in economic background, and figure out what's best for the city."
But even with the pressure, some members could not set aside the differences. C. Virginia Fields, the Councilwoman who represents most of Harlem and the Upper West Side of Manhattan, was the subject of some of the most intense lobbying late Wednesday night, not only from Mr. Vallone but also from her fellow black Council members.
Just before the meeting, several black legislators tried to persuade her to support the budget and not risk her position as chairwoman of one of the Council's land-use subcommittees.
"In the final analysis, I just couldn't vote for a budget that had such a severe impact on health care, on education and on social services in my district," said Ms. Fields. She said that although none of Mr. Vallone's aides had discussed her position as head of the subcommittee, she was prepared to lose the spot, for which she is paid an additional $7,500 a year. But she said her allocation of so-called member items, too, was reduced to $50,000 from the $80,000 she typically receives.
Councilwoman Ronnie M. Eldridge, who represents the Upper West Side of Manhattan, said her allocation of discretionary funds was similarly cut. She also said she was prepared for Mr. Vallone to ask her to step down as chairwoman of the Council's contracts committee.
 
'Their Loss'
 "If they take it, they take it," she said. "It will be their loss. I'm constantly surprised by how important these positions are to some people in the Council. But it really is a question of integrity. The Speaker asked me to vote for it. But I just can't vote for something I oppose."
In addition to Ms. Eldridge, Ms. Fields and Ms. McCabe, Council members opposing the budget were Sal F. Albanese and Annette M. Robinson of Brooklyn, Thomas K. Duane, Guillermo Linares and Adam Clayton Powell 4th of Manhattan.
In the Council meeting, several of its 21-member black and Hispanic caucus took pains to defend their decision to vote in favor of the budget, although they each contended that Mr. Giuliani's fiscal plan was likely to be felt most severely by black and Hispanic New Yorkers.
Some caucus members said they voted for the bill because it included restorations of some projects initially eliminated by Mr. Giuliani -- money for designing a new police academy in the Bronx and funds for youth programs, for example.
Mr. Linares, who represents Washington Heights in Manhattan, said that even though he was in the minority by voting against the budget, he could easily understand the pressures felt by his colleagues. "This was a difficult decision for each of us," he said. "Everyone had something to weigh, some feeling of conflict, some reason to spend time deliberating this. In some way, it was kind of a defining moment for all of us."

HEADLINE: The Market Gives Back Earlier Gain

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
The stock market gave back all of the previous day's gains and more yesterday, despite a stable dollar, nearly steady bond prices and falling commodities prices, which are normally conditions for a market rally.
Still, some analysts said they were optimistic about an upturn in the market. "The market will stumble upward," said Alfred Goldman, director of market analysis for A. G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis. 
 Mr. Goldman said the Dow Jones industrial average had risen about 200 points in the last five weeks, but in the last few days, had given back more than half the gains. "People are going to understand this is an opportunity market," he said. "When stocks are being thrown out of windows, it behooves you to hold a basket underneath and selectively catch some."
Still, traders appear to have some reason to worry about the three main factors that move markets, which are inflation, interest rates and corporate earnings. Inflation appears to be tame, but the weakened dollar has increased pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates to attract foreign investors to United States assets, including stocks.
Moreover, there was scattered anxiety among traders about the prospect of a slowing economy, brought about by the Fed's previous increases in interest rates, leading to lower second-quarter earnings. Companies start reporting financial results in two weeks or so. Recently, Lotus Development, Unisys and Cheyenne Software warned that their earnings were likely to disappoint Wall Street.
Yesterday, the Dow fell below 3,700 for the first time since May 16. The Dow dropped 25.68 points, to 3,699.09. On Wednesday, it rose nearly 17 points. The broader Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 3.46 points, to 449.63, after rising 1.75 points on Wednesday. Sears, Roebuck, General Motors, Philip Morris, I.B.M. and Coca-Cola all fell.
Especially hard hit was the smaller-company Nasdaq composite index, which fell 11.89 points, to 700.85, a decline of nearly 1.7 percent. Computer technology stocks like Microsoft, Cisco Systems, Oracle and Intel all fell amid concern that a slower economy would hurt the demand for computers and related products.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 1.68 points, to 248.29, with advancing stocks lagging behind declining stocks by 720 to 1,424. The American Stock Exchange market value index was off 1.97 points, to 431.25.
The most active stock, at 14.6 million shares, was Cisco Systems, a computer-networking company, which fell 2 1/2, to 21, on concern among Wall Street analysts that the company's earnings would be hurt by a slowing economy.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Mixed as Traders Pause After Recent Turmoil

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar ended mixed in quiet trading yesterday, as the currency market took a breather from the volatility that had sent the American currency plunging to a record low against the Japanese yen earlier this week.
For a second day, the Federal Reserve and other central banks failed to intervene in the market to support the dollar. But traders' continuing fears of possible central bank intervention helped prevent the heavy selling that shook the market on Tuesday, when the dollar fell below 100 yen in New York trading. 
 "The market is playing it close to the vest in case there's an intervention," said Kevin Lawrie, manager of foreign exchange for Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh.
 
 
Little Changed Against Yen
 Yesterday, the dollar showed little change against the yen. In late New York trading, it was quoted at 101.40 yen, up slightly from 101.10 yen Wednesday.
The dollar also slipped to 1.6025 German marks from 1.6050 marks.
The dollar traded in a narrow range for much of the day. It rose briefly in early trading on rumors that the Fed was buying dollars, but it fell back when the rumors were denied.
Only the Bank of Japan has intervened in the market this week to keep the yen from surging against the dollar.
In Europe, the German central bank's decision not to reduce key interest rates quashed a late dollar rally in a market that had been expecting a cut. Lower German interest rates would have brought European rates closer to American rates and stimulated capital flows into dollar-denominated investments.
"In terms of the week we've had, today has been a nonevent," said Paul Alley, an associate at the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan's New York office.
But analysts warned that the dollar's volatility did not appear to be over.
 
 
Agitated Market
 "The potential exists for some reasonably wide swings in the next couple of days," Mr. Alley said. "The market definitely appears to be agitated, and when that happens it takes a while before things settle down.
"We're still sitting on the edge of the dollar going into a total abyss against the yen; we're still in a downtrend."
Traders said the currency market showed little reaction to a Government report that factory orders for durable goods surged nine-tenths of 1 percent in May, providing further evidence of the strength of the American economy.
Among other currencies, the British pound rose to $1.5395 in New York, from $1.5315 on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: New Signs Of Slowdown In Economy

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 23

 BODY:
Fresh evidence of a decelerating economy appeared today as a moderate overall rise in new orders for durable goods was accompanied by the fourth consecutive decline in orders for equipment to be used by nonmilitary manufacturers.
Orders for durable goods -- items from toasters to helicopters designed to last at least three years -- climbed nine-tenths of 1 percent in May, aided by another double-digit gain in military contracts, Commerce Department figures show. While this advance was somewhat bigger than expected, many analysts regarded the report over all as pointing to a slackening of economic growth. 
 "The economy continues to expand modestly, slowing from the rapid-fire growth of six months ago," said Robert D. Barr, deputy chief economist for the United States Chamber of Commerce.
He added that durable goods, generally big-ticket items requiring financing, might be an early casualty of the rise in interest rates, which began last fall and was accelerated by the Federal Reserve in February.
 
 
Jobless Benefits Edge Up
 In a separate report, the Labor Department said today that first-time claims for unemployment benefits inched up 3,000, to 352,000, last week. On a four-week average, initial claims edged down to 355,000, a bit lower than in late spring but otherwise the highest in more than a year, according to Merrill Lynch & Company.
The reports released today will likely serve as further evidence for the Federal Reserve that the economy, while still expanding, is cooling, and that it need not rush to raise rates again to head off inflation.
"Here's an indicator that's steady but not out of control," said Patrick J. Moriarty, chief investment officer at Bank Julius Baer in New York, referring to the report on durable goods. The May rise, he noted, was the result of increases for military goods, which is not likely to continue, and in orders for commercial jets, which are delivered over long periods.
 
 
Economy Showing Strength
 At the same time, the economy seems strong enough to withstand another Fed tightening if it should decide higher interest rates are needed to support the dollar in international current markets.
The advance in durable good orders for May, to $148.4 billion, included a 2.2 percent jump for transportation equipment, a 4.7 percent rise for the much smaller primary metals group and a negligible one-tenth of 1 percent rise for industrial machinery and equipment.
On the other hand, new orders for electronic and other electrical equipment skidded 5 percent, a result thought by some to be an anomaly in light of a long period of robust growth.
Excluding military goods, orders were up four-tenths of 1 percent, less than half the overall gain, the report showed.
Within capital goods industries, orders for durable goods rose 1.1 percent over all but were down eight-tenths of 1 percent -- the fourth consecutive decline -- when tanks, planes and other military items were excluded. Military orders alone soared 11.9 percent, to $7.1 billion, after a 28.7 percent leap in April and a 20.1 percent drop in March.
Nonmilitary capital goods excluding aircraft and parts -- a gauge of underlying investment by business -- slumped 2.5 percent after a decline of three-tenths of 1 percent in April.

HEADLINE: Will a Falling Dollar Bring Inflation? Not Necessarily

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 23

 BODY:
Inflation fears fanned by the dollar's fall this week are overblown, many economists say. Despite all the talk about the global economy, they say, the United States is more insulated than most countries against such shocks.
A popular rule of thumb among specialists is that a 10 percent drop in the dollar against the rest of the world's currencies would add no more than one percentage point to the inflation rate over the next year or two. The rule is based partly on the fact that imports account for only a tenth of all goods and services sold in the United States, so changes in their prices are heavily diluted. 
 But some economists now question even this figure, saying that the actual effect may be much less. In fact, they say, it may be negligible for the 3 percent drop in the dollar against the yen and German mark in the last two weeks.
"There's enough downspin to inflation still that even with this, you still have a good chance of coming in under last year's increase" in consumer prices, said David C. Munro, a longtime White House economic forecaster who now works for High Frequency Economics in Manhattan.
Mr. Munro, who is anticipating more interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve to keep inflation under control, estimated that even a 5 percent fall in the value of the yen and the mark would increase consumer prices in the United States by only four-hundredths of a percentage point.
Indeed, Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, played down the globalization of the economy on Wednesday, during Congressional testimony. "At this point, we have little aggregate evidence that the increased openness of the United States economy over the past several decades has substantially altered the process of domestic price formation," he said.
Mr. Munro and other economists point out that foreign companies have passed on less and less of their losses from exchange rate movements in recent years, choosing instead to try to keep prices low and preserve their market shares. This means American companies have had less opportunity to raise their own prices.
 
Imports Priced in Dollars
 Economists also note that more of America's imports are coming from oil-producing countries that price their shipments in dollars or from East Asian and Latin American countries that tie their currencies informally to the dollar.
In the short run, a drop in the dollar against the yen or German mark has little effect on this growing share of American trade, although specialists caution that in the longer term, a drop might provoke Middle Eastern countries to raise oil prices to assure that it still takes the same number of barrels of oil to buy a Mercedes or a Sony television.
The dollar has simultaneously been strengthening in recent weeks against a few currencies, notably the Canadian dollar, said Jeffrey J. Schott, an economist at the Institute for International Economics. American imports last year from Canada nearly equaled imports from Japan and Germany combined.
Moreover, as dramatic as a record low against the yen always seems, the dollar has not really fallen very much in the last two weeks. Inflation depends on the size of the drop, not whether a yen is worth a penny for the first time. So inflation is unlikely to rise just because a dollar now buys 101 yen instead of 104 at the beginning of last week, or buys 1.6 German marks instead of 1.65 marks.
Yet such calculations, by themselves, are not likely to reassure the Federal Reserve, many economists say. The central bank has already raised interest rates four times this year so as to forestall the possibility of inflationary increases. And like falling bond prices, a falling exchange rate may be a clue that investors, expecting higher inflation ahead, are moving into other currencies first. In that case, most economists concur, higher interest rates are needed.
"If the falling dollar is the first sign of inflation, like the approaching clouds of a hurricane that you can see if you have a sharp eye, then a little bit of intervention in the exchange markets is not the right response at all," said William Poole, a Brown University monetary economist often mentioned as a future Republican nominee to the Federal Reserve.
 
Big Indirect Effect
 Other economists who rely on big computer models remain convinced that a falling dollar does have a big effect on inflation. They focus not on the direct effect of rising import prices, but rather on the indirect effect that a lower dollar may have in encouraging American exports. Cheaper dollars allow people in Germany or Japan to pay fewer marks or yen for a new Buick, and when the economy is already operating at or near full capacity, as it is now, growing exports could cause the economy to overheat, feeding inflation.
"The U.S. economy is in a more inflation-prone condition now than it was two or three years ago," said Allen Sinai, the chief economist at Lehman Brothers. "The vulnerability to inflation from a sustained drop in the dollar now would be greater."
But there is little agreement on exactly how vulnerable. While DRI/ McGraw-Hill, in Lexington, Mass., assumes that the indirect effect outweighs the direct effects, Mr. Munro said that the indirect effect was too small even to be measured.
The strongest consensus is that the falling dollar will most affect Americans who go to Europe or Japan and find the restaurants and hotels much more expensive in dollar terms. "It's terrible," said Patrick J. Conway, an associate professor of economics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. "I'm leaving on Saturday and I'm lucky, I'm jumping right over Europe and Japan to Central Asia, where the dollar still stands tall."

HEADLINE: American Love Affair With the Auto May Doom Magnetic Rail;
New York's Progress

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your June 13 article on the ambivalent relationship of the United States with magnetic levitation technology does not note that New York State has gone further than any other state toward building a maglev system. 
 In the 1994-95 budget passed this month, $22 million has been appropriated for high-speed ground transportation. Of that, $2 million will go into the development of United States maglev technology at Stewart Airport in Orange County. New York's maglev rail system will work in tandem with a more sophisticated conventional high-speed rail system from Niagara Falls to New York City.
When completed, the maglev portion of the system will go from New York City to Albany, and eventually from Albany through Massachusetts to Boston. When operational, one will be able to travel from downtown New York to downtown Boston in less time than it takes to travel by air.
Maglev technology is an energy-efficient transportation system. Investing in high-speed rail presents New York with an opportunity to be the first state to develop the intercity transportation system of the future, one that does not pollute our air and that is not dependent on foreign sources of energy.
You point out that the Federal Government has been unenthusiastic about investing in maglev technology, with the exception of the Cassandra-like urgings of New York's Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
However, although Germany and Japan are ahead of us in their development, it is not too late for the United States to make up ground. Federal funds for maglev could give United States industry the opportunity to develop and export high-speed ground transportation systems that could reinvigorate United States industry. This is a technology that is ideally suited for defense industries that have drastically cut their work forces and that can only thrive in a post-defense industry economy by finding innovative niches in civilian technologies.
New York has committed substantial public resources to the development of a meaningful high-speed ground transportation network. It's time that the Federal Government follows Senator Moynihan's lead and does the same.

HEADLINE: Clinton Tries to Head Off Senate on Bosnia Embargo

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 23

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration began a furious diplomatic and lobbying campaign today to head off a Senate bill that orders the President to ignore the United Nations and unilaterally end United States participation in the arms embargo against Bosnia.
In league with the Administration, Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia rounded up four European military officials to testify today against lifting the embargo. But Senator Nunn's tactic only escalated emotions in the already fractious debate. 
 It prompted his colleagues on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who want the embargo lifted to stage another hearing in the afternoon. Top Administration officials responded by testifying against lifting the embargo.
Those who favor defying the United Nations embargo say the Muslim-dominated Bosnian Government, which is outgunned by the Bosnian Serbs, would be better able to defend itself after a lifting of the arms embargo, which was imposed by the Security Council in September 1991 and applies throughout the old Yugoslav federation.
 
A Plea to Lift Sanctions
 "We want the change because we are dying," Ejup Ganic, a Bosnian Vice President, told the panel. "We are not asking for your troops to fight for us on the ground. That is our job and our task. But please, do not combine any more big words with small deeds."
He said a better-armed Bosnian Army would improve the Government's chances of negotiating a settlement with the Serbs, who control about 70 percent of the country.
The Administration is fighting the Congressional move even as it hints to the Serbs that the major powers would back a United Nations resolution lifting the arms embargo if the Serbs reject the latest international peace plan for Bosnia. At the same time, the major powers, including the United States and Russia, are threatening to ease a separate economic embargo against Serb-dominated Yugoslavia, which supports the Bosnian Serbs, if the Bosnian Government rejects the plan.
One senior official said the Administration might propose a compromise amendment that would defy the arms embargo if the Serbs rejected the peace plan.
 
A Loss of Credibility?
 Those who oppose the unilateral violation of the embargo say it would wreck the credibility of the United States at the United Nations; strain the NATO alliance, whose principal members all support the embargo; wreak havoc in the Balkans, and increase the bloodshed, not reduce it.
Senator Nunn said that if the United States reneged on this embargo, it would have no authority in other cases, such as North Korea. "The broader picture is what throws me," he said.
Strobe Talbott, the Deputy Secretary of State, said he understood the desire to lift the embargo, saying it was "rooted in frustration and outrage" that the war had persisted for so long. But he warned that doing so unilaterally would jeopardize the peace talks now under way and would ultimately backfire by drawing the United States in deeper.
The Senate is preparing to vote early next week on a bipartisan amendment to the defense authorization bill that calls for the United States to defy the embargo.
Two United States Navy ships are among the 20 ships from 11 countries enforcing the embargo in the Adriatic. But since signing a federation agreement with Bosnian Croats in March, the Bosnian Government is reported to have received substantial new supplies of weapons through Croatia.
The Senate in May passed a measure calling on the United States to defy the embargo, but only by one vote. At the same time, it passed a second measure, also by one vote, urging that the United States not act alone but urge its allies to end the embargo together. On June 9, the House voted 244 to 178 to violate the embargo unilaterally, sending the issue back to the Senate for resolution.
 
Attached to Defense Bill
 Administration officials have said President Clinton would veto a bill that called for unilateral defiance of the embargo. But the Senate bill, which does just that, is attached to the defense authorization bill. Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, who is sponsoring the measure with Senator Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas and the minority leader, said it would be difficult for the President to veto the entire defense bill because of this measure.
But he also acknowledged that pressure from the Administration against the bill was intense. Its supporters had planned for the Senate to vote today but postponed it until early next week. While sentiment seems to be running high in Congress to lift the embargo, some top Congressional aides suggest that once Senators realize that this vote is "for real," as one put it, they might back off.
The Europeans testified this morning that unilateral defiance by the United States of the embargo would throw NATO into chaos, disrupt the fragile cease-fires that have been established, end the humanitarian aid, hurt peace negotiations and widen the war.
Moreover, they said, the United States would automatically assume "moral responsibility" for what would follow, meaning America would be drawn into the conflict.
Those testifying were defense official Anders Troldborg of Denmark, Jean-Claude Mallet of France, Gen. Juan Martinez Esparza of Spain and Maj. Gen. Rupert Smith of Britain. France, Britain and Spain are major contributors to the United Nations peacekeeping force in Bosnia.
In an unusual outburst, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, interrupted Senator Nunn to object to the fact that no one from the country under discussion had been invited to testify. "Too bad we can't get the views of any of the people getting killed," said a seething Mr. McCain.

HEADLINE: Risk Where Least Expected

BYLINE: By SUSAN ANTILLA 

 BODY:
Smart investors know to brace themselves for wild rides in certain kinds of mutual funds, because the small-stock fund or overseas fund from which they profit today could cause a migraine tomorrow.
But in the case of the funds that invest in short-term Government bonds, no such worry seemed warranted. Or so it would seem from advertising by brokerage firms and mutual fund companies that trumpeted their short-term fixed-income funds as safe alternatives to lower-yielding money market funds and certificates of deposits in the early 1990's. The ads promised higher yields without much more risk. 
 One source of reassurance was the fact that the funds invested in Government bonds, which did not carry the risk of default or bankruptcy like bonds issued by companies. The other attraction was short maturities, which, though not as short as money market funds, still held out the likelihood that even if interest rates moved up they would not be whipsawed as much as longer-term securities.
 
 
Now, the Reality
 The reality has been somewhat different. After having gained 3.39 percent in net asset value in the eight months that ended Jan. 31, short-term Government bond funds turned into dogs as rising interest rates devastated the bond market earlier this year. The 104 funds in one short-term category tracked by Lipper Analytical Services Inc. lost an average of 2.08 percent in the five months through May 31. Worst of all was the Piper Jaffray Institutional Government Income Portfolio Fund, which plummeted 23.91 percent in that period. Next was the Fundamental U.S. Government Strategic Income Fund, down 16.19 percent.
The short-term bond funds -- which generally include Government securities like Treasury bonds, and Government agency bonds including those of the Student Loan Marketing Association, or Sallie Mae, and the Government National Mortgage Association, or Ginnie Mae -- have been enormously popular in recent years. Nearly $10 billion in new money poured into the short-term bond category in 1991, followed by $11.4 billion in 1992 -- the peak year for the short-term bond funds.
Many print advertisements for the funds have stressed stability of principal as a big plus: "An investment that performs . . . whether interest rates go up or down," read the headline in a magazine advertisement in early 1992 for the Franklin Adjustable U.S. Government Securities Fund -- down 4.7 percent in net asset value since March 1993.
A "high-quality portfolio is managed to help minimize price fluctuation," read the copy of an advertisement for the Scudder Short Term Bond Fund, down 6 percent since Dec. 28.
While fund companies pitched the short-term bond funds at investors looking for ultrasafe products -- "Why renew your low-yielding C.D.?" asked an advertisement for Fidelity Short-Term Bond Portfolio -- they rarely explained prominently that investors might suffer a loss of principal. The Fidelity Short-Term Bond Portfolio, for example, has lost 6 percent of its net asset value since Jan. 12. "It is carefully managed by Fidelity for a high degree of share price stability," the ad said.
At Scudder, James Smith, vice president for marketing, said he would still be comfortable running the same advertisement, because the ads prompt investors to call Scudder's information lines, where details of risk are "fleshed out." Greg Johnson, the head of marketing at Franklin/Templeton, said that Franklin's sales brochures and prospectus clearly stated the risks, and that investors in the fund had not lost principal when dividend payments were factored in.
At Fidelity, Neal Litvak, executive vice president for marketing, also said that while investors in the short-term bond fund might have seen net asset value fall, they were not losers on balance when reinvestment of dividends was factored in. He added that phone representatives at Fidelity questioned callers extensively about their risk tolerance.
The Fidelity, Franklin and Scudder short-term funds are on the Lipper list of 104 companies because they fall in different short-term fund categories, and are evaluated by Lipper elsewhere.
Some investors might have been better served had they understood the differences between the safety of principal in their certificates of deposit and the safety of principal in the short-term funds, John Teall, a spokesman for Lipper, said. "I think there was some perception that the short-term Government funds gave you some extra return without a great deal more risk," he said. "In the case of some funds, that was absolutely true. But in some cases, as we've seen, there was substantially more risk."
 
 
'Look at Returns'
 Mr. Teall said that investors could have used relatively simple techniques to gauge whether the fund they were considering fell into the risky or stable category. "The easiest way to tell is to look at returns," he explained. "If your returns are substantially different from everyone else in the group, your portfolio manager is probably taking risks that others are not willing to take."
Thus, little surprise that Piper Jaffray's fund, the worst of the 104 funds in the January-May period, was the No. 1 short-term bond fund between May 31, 1993, and Jan. 31. Piper Jaffray's fund suffered greatly because an esoteric mortgage security called an inverse floater proved a disaster as interest rates rose -- and unexpectedly illiquid as a result of the selling panic that ensued.
Inverse floaters are one of several categories of esoteric securities that Wall Street firms create out of pools of home mortgages. These bonds, whose interest payments go up as rates fall and go down as rates rise, are a particularly aggressive way to place a bet on interest rates -- they rise and fall more sharply than more conservative fixed-income securities.
 Funds that crashed from their top spots did so for a variety of reasons. The Fundamental U.S. Government Strategic Income Fund took its 16.19 percent hit in large part as a result of a position in inverse floaters. The fund's portfolio managers had thought that it was adequately hedged against unfavorable movements by the inverse floaters, a spokesman said. But its hedges in the bond futures and options markets did not work as planned during the unexpectedly quick rise in interest rates earlier this year, he said.
More common is the sort of problem that the Franklin Adjustable fund ran into: its large position in adjustable-rate mortgages stunned the portfolio because of the lag effect of the resetting of adjustable-rate mortgages. "You have a period of up to six months before an adjustable mortgage resets to the higher rates," Mr. Johnson said, explaining that the mortgages in which the funds invested were temporarily paying below-market rates.
Lipper's Mr. Teall noted that as is frequently the case in mutual fund selection, the plodders among short-term bond funds tended to have been the best selections when all was said and done. "Average returns may not be exciting on the way up, but on the way down it's nice to get that 2.5 percent instead of losing 20 percent," he said. "Most people are happiest in funds that return average numbers. You pick your risks, you pick your rewards."
As for the one-time high-fliers, not even a settling down of the fixed-income market may be enough to prevent future turbulence. When the bond market came apart this spring, many fund managers were forced to unload securities in order to meet the redemption requests of disgusted shareholders, Mr. Teall said. "But they got rid of the best and easiest-to-sell pieces first," he added. "And what they're left with now is the hardest, almost diabolical pieces. We suspect what's left is the worst."

HEADLINE: OPPOSITION FORCES JAPANESE PREMIER TO LEAVE OFFICE

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Saturday, June 25

 BODY:
A year after being ousted from power, Japan's Liberal Democratic Party took its revenge on the defectors who brought it down, forcing Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata to resign this morning rather than face certain defeat in a no-confidence resolution.
Mr. Hata's announcement at 11:15 A.M. (10:15 P.M. New York time) touched off a scramble for power that could, under some scenarios, see the Liberal Democrats return to power as the leading party in a new coalition government. They ran the country for 38 years until countless scandals forced them out last summer as part of a drive to reform both the political system and an overregulated, faltering economy. 
 If the Liberal Democrats succeeded in forming a coalition government of their own -- by combining with some of the small parties that have split with the coalition -- many political analysts believe that the wide range of reforms begun last year could grind to a stop.
But Mr. Hata's allies vowed they would try to reassemble the fractured and embittered coalition they cobbled together last July to create the first non-Liberal Democratic government here since 1955. Under one scenario, Mr. Hata could even be installed again, though with a very different Cabinet.
Whatever the outcome, the weeks of confusion ahead seem bound to hamper the Clinton Administration's ability to reach a broad range of trade agreements with Japan before the summit meeting of the seven largest industrialized democracies in Naples, Italy, in early July. In fact, it could place Mr. Clinton in the same position he was in at last year's meeting in Tokyo: He may be negotiating with a Prime Minister who is certain to be out of a job in weeks.
Mr. Hata would attend the summit meeting as a caretaker unless another Prime Minister is elected by the Parliament. If he is replaced in the next three days -- Parliament is scheduled to go out of session Wednesday -- he would hold the dubious record as the Japanese Prime Minister who served the shortest term in office under the post-war constitution.
Oddly enough, political chaos in Japan could continue the strengthening of the yen and the weakening of the dollar that has shaken financial markets in recent days. The markets may conclude that the Japanese Government is in no position to help narrow the trade surplus with the United States. Many economist believe the surplus is a major factor driving the dollar down.
"It is an urgent task to form a stable government," Mr. Hata said, with a grim smile, as he appeared before reporters this morning. Citing the pressing problems of exchange rates and the nuclear standoff with North Korea he added, "We should stop the power struggles. Otherwise, the people's distrust of politics will grow."
Mr. Hata's decision to, in his words, "leave the establishment of a new government to the will of the Diet," followed two days of fruitless negotiations with the Socialist party, which he hoped could save him from defeat in the no-confidence resolution.
The Socialists, once the largest party in the coalition government, abandoned Mr. Hata as soon as he took office 62 days ago, declaring that he and his allies were plotting to exclude them from power. Today, they said their conditions for returning to the fold, which would have once again given the coalition a majority in Parliament, had not been met.
The Socialists differ with the largely conservative coalition on a wide variety of policy issues, from the role of the Japanese military to the conservative's hopes to increase sales taxes as Japan's population ages.
 
Pride Is the Issue
 But the major issue was one of pride: The Socialist have resented the behind-the-scenes power of Ichiro Ozawa, Mr. Hata's closest ally and Japan's most powerful politician. He has made no secret of his desire to cast them out of the government as soon as he finds more ideologically compatible replacements. The leader of the Socialists, Tomiichi Murayama, said today that Mr. Hata "had responded fairly" to the demands from his party that he step down, and he said he was willing to try to re-create last year's coalition government "and pick the prime minister in a democratic manner."
But Mr. Ozawa is a wily political operator, and he has been working furiously behind the scenes to rid himself of the Socialists and split the faction-ridden Liberal Democrats, in which he was once among the most powerful players. He has been trying to lure away younger members of the party, telling them that the L.D.P. is a political dinosaur, out of touch with the country and unwilling to make the changes needed in the way Japan governs itself and takes part in global affairs.
He has also dangled the premiership in front of a Liberal Democratic party elder, Michio Watanabe. Mr. Watanabe is widely believed to be suffering from cancer, and this may be his last chance at the top job. To get it, though, he has to deliver dozens of new L.D.P. defectors to Mr. Ozawa.
Ultimately, Mr. Ozawa has a clear goal: To create two conservative parties in Japan of roughly equal power, each able to take over the reigns of government.
Getting there, however, will require broad realignments of political forces that have been fractured ever since the L.D.P. began to crack apart last year. Today, loyalty to parties and factions means nothing. Each member of parliament has become a free agent as the country's once rock-solid party system shatters like glass.
Mr. Hata could have dissolved the Parliament and called for a new election. He had done so, the election would have been held under the country's old election laws and districts, because a new system authorized by Parliament a number of months ago -- the main political reform accomplishment of the coalition governments -- is not yet in place.
Mr. Hata and Mr. Ozawa decided, apparently, that they had a better chance at keeping the Liberal Democrats at bay through backroom politics than by risking another election under a system that is biased toward the older party's traditional strengths in Japan's rural areas.

HEADLINE: THE BATTERED DOLLAR: OVERVIEW;
A GLOBAL EFFORT ON DOLLAR FAILS

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 24

 BODY:
A multibillion-dollar global buying spree today by the Federal Reserve and 15 other central banks to prop up the dollar in the face of a new onslaught from currency traders failed to prevent the dollar from again slipping against the Japanese yen and the German mark.
The coordinated central bank operation, led by the Clinton Administration, initially stemmed the dollar's slide against both the mark and the yen, but only briefly, as the American currency resumed its drop, falling by late in the day to 1.585 marks, its lowest level in more than a year, and to 100.65 yen, just above the record low of 99.90 yen that it touched briefly on Tuesday. 
 The actual fall of the dollar today against the mark and the yen was small. But what worries some currency traders as well as some American officials is not the size of the decline, but the symbolic statement that the continued slide makes about investors' attitudes toward the American economy now, as well as the fact that traders were not afraid to sell the dollar even in the face of 16 central banks moving in the other direction.
Indeed, the mood among currency traders remained downbeat about the dollar, with many dismissing the Administration's defense of the currency as lame.
The fact that the 16-nation intervention, which involved about $5 billion in dollar purchases, did not particularly impress the markets would seem to increase the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will conclude that it has to raise interest rates once again, either at the next meeting of its policy committee, on July 5-6, or before then. By raising rates, the Federal Reserve could further dampen any fears of inflation, as well as make returns on American bank accounts and securities more attractive, so that investors would want to put their money in dollars.
Another interest rate increase would hardly be good for domestic growth. But if intervention is ineffective, the only weapon left to the United States to support the dollar in the short term would seem to be for the Federal Reserve to raise the Federal funds rate, the interest rate that banks charge each other, for the fifth time this year.
This short-term rate currently stands at 4.25 percent after beginning the year at 3 percent. Traders say nothing other than higher interest rates seems likely to impress the currency market, where there still seems to be some feeling that the threat of inflation in the United States justifies another rise in rates.
President Clinton said today in an interview on a St. Louis radio station that he and others were puzzled by the dollar's continued decline, given the fact that the long-term prognosis for the American economy is actually quite healthy.
"This is a development that is puzzling a lot of economists," Mr. Clinton said. Noting that the economy "is performing so well," Mr. Clinton said that "in a funny way the currency values are running in the opposite direction of economic strength."
Currency traders and market analysts say the President may be right about the long-run health of the American economy, but the problem is that in today's lightning-fast financial markets, there is no long run anymore. For many traders, particularly those who deal in the most liquid asset of all -- currencies -- there is only the short run.
What ails the dollar, traders say, is the coming together of a number of factors that make the yen and the mark relatively more attractive than the American currency. Germany and Japan are both clearly coming out of recession and both are perceived as having a greater chance of keeping their inflation rates under control. Also, both those nations have clearly slowed the pace of their own interest rate reductions for now, making their bank deposits and bonds relatively more attractive.
 
Reversal of Perceptions
 "U.S. assets, relatively speaking, simply don't appeal to the very fleet-footed international investors right now, and they are voting with their feet," Richard Witten, a senior currency trader at Goldman, Sachs, said. "Last year American stocks and bonds could do no wrong. This year it is the opposite. Why? Because no one has a credible argument as to why the American stock or bond market should bottom here. There is some uncertainty about our growth, while there is less uncertainty about Japan's and Germany's.
"Remember, the currency markets do not feed on absolutes, but on relative valuations, and right now -- on a relative basis, the United States looks worse to a lot of investors, and Japan and Germany better. Every day capital becomes more mobile, so those relative valuations matter."
The danger for President Clinton is that Republicans have begun to seize on the fall of the dollar to discredi what has been the Administration's most effective policy area -- its handling of the economy. Actually, despite the recent decline in the dollar, the American currency has actually risen 1 percent against the German mark since Mr. Clinton's election and it has not fallen against the Japanese yen any more steeply than it did under the Bush Administration.
Nevertheless, that has not discouraged Republicans from taking advantage of the headlines, with Senator Pete Domenici of New Mexico saying in a speech on the Senate floor today that the dollar's slide was a "global vote of no confidence" in the Clinton Administration's economic policies.
A senior Clinton Treasury official responded, "The dollar's modest fall over the last several months is no more a referendum on this President's economic policy than were the declines of more than 10 percent over several intervals during the previous Administration a referendum on the Bush Administration's policies."
Still, while the Administration's intervention in the foreign currency markets was a substantive move, its public statements backing up the dollar have been seen as weak. Earlier this year, the Administration had said clearly and publicly that it was not seeking to push the dollar down further to help increase exports, a statement that was absent this week. Some traders say there is something almost half-hearted about the Administration's statements.
Today's move was the third time this year that the United States along with other major central banks has intervened in the markets by selling other currencies and buying dollars.
Germany, Japan and other nations do not want a further decline in the dollar because that makes American products cheaper and easier to sell abroad and makes foreign exports to the United States and other places more expensive and harder to sell.
The United States does not want the dollar to keep falling because that makes many imports more expensive. Economists estimate that every decline of 10 percent in the dollar's value against the other major currencies could add as much as one percentage point to the annual inflation rate, although some say the actual effect has been less.
But some economists also point out that while the dollar has been falling against the yen and the mark, it has held steady, or even risen, against other currencies whose countries trade as much or more with the United States as do Germany and Japan.
Mr. Clinton took note of this today, saying, "The American dollar is actually stronger against a lot of other currencies in the world than it was a year ago."

HEADLINE: Doctors Slow to Join H.M.O.'s Now Often Find Doors Shut

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
In January, the once-bustling offices of the Brook-Island Pediatric Group in Bensonhurst turned much quieter, as the number of appointments suddenly dropped by 40 percent. Was it the fierce winter weather? Or, perhaps, the mild flu season? The five doctors searched for explanations.
Over the next two months they discovered the answer: in December, when many companies allow employees to change health insurance programs, a large number of families in the practice switched to health maintenance organizations or other forms of managed care. 
 "We had resisted getting into H.M.O.'s and networks and we felt we could afford to since we had an old practice and a strong practice," said Dr. Veronica Santilli, a senior member of the group. "But by February we were very, very scared."
So scared, in fact, that the private doctors, who had spurned H.M.O.'s as cumbersome and intrusive bureaucracies that would limit their fees and meddle with their medical decisions, tried to join the local H.M.O.'s. They were dismayed, however, to find that managed-care groups were no longer interested in recruiting them.
The predicament these doctors find themselves in is one of the latest twists in the changing world of American medicine. It highlights the growing problems for those who cannot, or will not, adjust quickly enough as the nation increasingly embraces managed care as a way of containing medical costs.
Many private doctors, who say they will now take H.M.O. rates and play by their rules, are hoping that new laws will insure their access to H.M.O's. Across the country physician groups have lined up behind legislation proposed in Congress and numerous state legislatures that would effectively require H.M.O.'s to accept any doctor or health professional who meets standards for training, skills and credentials. They say that the networks' unwillingness to open their doors has already ripped apart countless longstanding doctor-patient relationships.
But executives at H.M.O.'s say that to maintain tight control over the cost and quality of care in their organizations, they must limit the number of doctors who can join. What's more, they point out that several years ago they fruitlessly begged these same doctors to join their networks. Back then, it was the younger doctors who joined the networks in an effort to build practices, while established doctors resisted and are now largely left out.
"When I hear all the complaining, it reminds me of the story of the Little Red Hen," said Steve Wilkins, president and chief executive officer of Oxford Health Plans, the fastest-growing H.M.O. in the metropolitan region. "When she asked the other animals to help her plant grains of wheat, they said no; when she asked them to help water them, they said no. But when they grew and she made them into bread, they wanted to eat it. And she said: 'No, you were not involved in making this.' "
 
'You're Frozen Out'
 The New York metropolitan region has until recently been one of the last strongholds of the traditional medical system centered on doctors in private practice, and has lagged behind the rest of the country in adopting managed care. But increasingly doctors here are finding that they too must join H.M.O.'s to survive. At the same time, the region's surplus of doctors -- particularly specialists -- means that spots in the networks are scarce or nearly impossible to find.
"In many categories of medical practice you're frozen out -- it's extremely difficult if not impossible to get into any plan," said Dr. Morton Kurtz, a general practitioner in Queens who is past president of the New York State Medical Society.
Industry analysts say that forcing H.M.O.'s to accept more doctors than they want or need will only inflate premiums. And they add that the region's patients have voted with their feet by enrolling in managed care, indicating that they are willing to sacrifice their physicians to gain affordable health care.
Douglas B. Sherlock, president of the Sherlock Company, which does financial consulting for H.M.O.'s, said: "The doctor told patients, 'Join at your own risk because I'm not going to join.' And ultimately Mrs. Smith said, 'Sorry, doctor, it's a good deal.' So now he's in trouble and trying to get the legislature to protect him from a poor decision he made a few years ago. It's rather arrogant, don't you think?"
 
Growing Rapidly in New York
 The war between doctors and networks is being fought nationwide, but the battle in New York has been particularly virulent, since the state's H.M.O.'s have only recently captured a hefty chunk the health care market. Between March 1993 and January 1994, H.M.O. enrollment in New York grew by 20 percent to more than 4.3 million members, and a number of plans have witnessed even more spectacular growth since then. Oxford expects to enroll more than 150,000 New Yorkers this year, doubling its membership. In the first quarter of 1994, U.S. Healthcare, which has more than 400,000 patients in New York, increased its membership 30 percent. Almost 20 percent of state residents are now enrolled in H.M.O.'s, and about 15 percent in New York City.
"When managed-care penetration gets up around 15 percent, then doctors start to feel it," said Dr. Peter Kongstvedt, a former H.M.O. executive who is now with the consulting firm of Ernst & Young in Washington. "When physicians see a number of patients get copies of their records and go, then it's real."
Many private doctors initially avoided H.M.O.'s because they were reluctant to cede control over medical decisions and the plans paid far less than traditional insurers. But that reluctance has waned recently since being part of networks now offers the economic advantage in many neighborhoods, as more patients move into managed care.
 
How Free a Choice?
 Doctors and H.M.O.'s argue over whether patients are freely choosing H.M.O.'s or are being forced in by employers. Doctors' groups maintain that more of their patients are being forced into the networks, so private doctors should be given more rights to join H.M.O.'s. But the pawns in the battle are patients.
Anna Carpenter had taken her two children to Brook-Island Pediatrics for eight years, until her husband's company switched its employees into managed care in January 1993. The pediatricians were not interested in joining plans at that time.
Although Mrs. Carpenter initially decided to try the network's doctors, she lost confidence in the nearest network pediatrician after an incorrect diagnosis. For several months, she went to the H.M.O. doctor for routine checks and immunizations, returning to her old pediatrician when her children were ill. But then the H.M.O. doctor called her to say she would no longer see the children unless Mrs. Carpenter would trust her medical judgment for all types of care. She now pays to see Dr. Santilli.
And Mrs. Carpenter is luckier than many: her H.M.O. pays 75 percent of the cost for out-of-network care related to illness and her private pediatrician has been willing to play tag-team with the doctor at the H.M.O. Many private doctors resent patients who have deserted them for plans returning on an ad hoc basis when they run into trouble.
 
'Very Discouraging'
 Although Dr. Santilli has tried to join Mrs. Carpenter's plan, she says she has been rebuffed by that one and others.
"It's been very discouraging, to say they least," Dr. Santilli said. "They don't return calls. They say they'll send an application, which never arrives. Some tell us straight out that the network is closed."
The closing of networks has affected specialists far more than primary care doctors, since H.M.O.'s tend to rely heavily on generalists and severely restrict the number of specialists they employ. That is particularly true in places like the metropolitan area where there is a glut of highly trained physicians.
Dr. Robert Bergmann, the chief of the department of ophthalmology at Brunswick Hospital in Amityville, L.I., came late to the world of networks and has been turned away by five plans, each of which has enough eye specialists. "The H.M.O.'s have been knocking themselves out in Nassau County, and my practice has gone from a lovely mix of young and old to basically a Medicare practice," said Dr. Bergmann, who has been in practice 40 years. "A few years ago I was booked three months in advance. I'm still busy, and I think I'll be able to weather this storm. But if not I'll just retire."
Health policy experts say that given the shortage of primary care doctors in the region, qualified internists, pediatricians and family doctors should have no trouble finding slots. But physicians in the trenches, like Dr. Kurtz and Dr. Santilli, say their experience belies that wisdom.
 
Supply and Demand
 H.M.O. executives say they must be careful to add doctors only where there is demand. If an H.M.O. enrolls 1,000 people in Brooklyn, for example, it might not want more than 20 general doctors in the borough. They say it is more efficient for them to deal with 20 doctors, each treating 200 members, than 400 doctors, each treating 10, and many require that member doctors agree to accept at least 100 patients.
"The more business a doctor does with a managed-care organization, the more he will pay attention to its needs," said Dr. Kongstvedt. "If he only see one patients from the H.M.O. every two weeks, neither he nor his office staff will have enough business to understand its quality management or to pay attention to its administrative processes."
H.M.O.'s add that many of the doctors now applying to them as generalists do not meet their training requirements or are underemployed specialists, like cardiologists, now willing to do primary care. But Mr. Wilkins said that such doctors often had little up-to-date experience in general medicine and took it on begrudgingly as a back-door route to specialty referrals.
What's more, he said, an H.M.O. might in some cases reasonably refuse to hire qualified physicians as a business decision, if they would compete against doctors already in the plan: "If you have two medical groups five miles from each other and both are high quality, you're naturally going to support the people who took a risk and supported you early on," he said.
Doctors' groups say the issue is not about money, but fairness for professionals and, ultimately, patient care. The American Medical Association stops just short of insisting that H.M.O.'s be required to include all capable doctors, but insists that plans should reveal their selection standards, so that doctors may fight back if turned down.
"Doctors are excluded based on some kind of financial analysis they don't even have access to; it's disturbing and abusive," said Kirk Johnson, general council of the A.M.A. "After all, this is not just about business. It's about a relationship between a doctor and a patient."

HEADLINE: THE BATTERED DOLLAR;
Buying Forays Transformed A Sluggish Summer Friday

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
The dollar continued its decline against the Japanese yen and German mark yesterday, despite a concerted but not overly vigorous effort by the Federal Reserve and other central banks to reverse its recent slide on world currency markets.
The currency market intervention by the Fed and other banks, including the Bank of Japan and the Bundesbank of Germany, transformed what otherwise probably would have been a sluggish summer Friday into a very active trading session. 
 Dealers said the Fed made its initial foray around 9:30 A.M. in New York, buying dollars for yen and marks after the dollar declined against both in Asian and European currency markets. The dollar quickly shot up to 101.85 yen, but soon gave up most of its gains.
Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar had fallen as low as 100.05 yen, not far above its record low of 99.90 yen that it briefly touched on Tuesday.
 
Second Round Aims at Mark

The Fed was back again early in the afternoon, but traders said the second round was solely in support of the dollar against the mark.
Nevertheless, the dollar ended lower. By late yesterday it was quoted at 100.65 yen, down from 101.40 on Thursday. And it fell nearly two pfennigs against the mark, to 1.5850 marks, its lowest level in more than a year, from 1.6025 marks on Thursday.
Initially, though, the intervention strategy had its intended effect, as the dollar bounced off its lows against both currencies. But the gains were short-lived.
"Those that had an interest in selling the dollar but were waiting for the intervention to come sold it after the dollar bounced," one trader said. "And once the intervention went away, the dollar's basic weakness reasserted itself."
This intervention was the third time this year and the first since May 4 that the Fed and other central banks acted in concert to support the dollar. Until yesterday, only the Bank of Japan had acted this week to keep the yen from surging.
 
A Good Day for Intervening
 Traders and analysts said the central banks had picked the best day of the week to try to influence the value of the dollar. Trading volume is generally light on a Friday and dealers are reluctant to take on new positions in advance of a weekend. But they just as quickly rattled off a long list of reasons for the inability of yesterday's intervention to calm financial markets, let alone reverse the dollar's course.
Perhaps most important, traders said, was that the market had been expecting such a move.
After the dollar fell to new post-World War II lows against the yen on Tuesday, the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, and Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bensten said they were monitoring developments in financial markets carefully.
Currency traders and analysts looked at those remarks -- as well as the dollar's weakness -- and started waiting for the central banks.
"The beast was out there in the jungle, and we sort of expected it," the trader said. "The intervention came in a market when nobody was leaning the wrong way."
Interventions are most often successful when they surprise speculators betting on further weakness in the dollar. But even though the market has been remarkably pessimistic about the dollar for some time, traders said speculators had mostly stayed on the sidelines.
In addition, the calendar adversely affected the ability of intervention to alter market psychology.
At the moment, financial market participants are acutely uncertain about how to interpret recent economic trends in the United States, Japan and Europe. Based on the most recent data, it appears that growth prospects in Germany and Japan are increasing even as they are cooling in the United States. That sense is providing an incentive to move money.
"There is a very negative perception about U.S. assets, and the investing community is reflecting that," said Richard E. Witten, a partner at Goldman, Sachs & Company. "In this building, people are equally negative on the 29th floor, where equities are traded, on the 26th floor, where we trade bonds, and on the sixth floor, where we trade currencies."
But those perceptions could change drastically in the next 10 days to two weeks. On July 8, for example, the Labor Department is expected to release June employment data. A strong jobs report would go far to dispel the notion of a cooling American economy, could force the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates and would probably provide support for the dollar.
Yesterday's currency intervention may not have stemmed the dollar's fall, but traders said they expected the central banks to be back at it again, and probably soon.
"Neither the Japanese or the Germans want their currencies to appreciate any further," said Scott Pardee, chairman of Yamaichi International America.

HEADLINE: Stocks Tumble With Dollar as Dow Falls 62.15

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
Stocks fell far, fast and early yesterday, as currency intervention by the United States and other nations failed to stop the decline of the dollar. Bond prices plunged, worsening the stock market's decline.
The dollar's drop again raised the prospect that the Federal Reserve would be forced to raise interest rates to make dollar-denominated assets more attractive, particularly to foreign investors. 
 But traders are already concerned that the Fed's four previous rate increases this year have hurt corporate earnings, and therefore stocks. The Fed's policy-making committee is scheduled to meet on July 5 to consider long-term monetary policy.
 
 
Political Crisis in Japan
 Moreover, fresh doubts were raised about the future of the Japanese Government and the course of trade talks between the United States and Japan. Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, who was facing a no-confidence vote, said today in Tokyo that he would resign. Before his announcement, analysts had predicted that the dollar would drop further if he was forced from office.
Yesterday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 62.15 points, to 3,636.94, the steepest one-day drop since March 30. On that date the Dow plunged more than 72 points after falling on the four previous trading days; the March declines came after the Fed raised short-term interest rates a second time.
Some traders who say the market is in a bearish mode trace the beginnings of the bearishness to late March. But even though stock prices have fallen to more attractive levels, many traders seem to be staying on the sidelines. Trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange was below normal, with 261.3 million shares changing hands. By contrast, the decline on March 30 involved volume of 390 million shares.
For the week, the Dow lost nearly 140 points.
After rising sharply after the central bank purchases yesterday morning, the dollar settled at 100.65 Japanese yen, near post-World War II lows, and 1.58 German marks, the lowest level against the mark in more than a year.
 The dollar's decline discourages foreign investors from buying American assets, including stocks, because dollar-denominated assets lose value when they are converted back into home currencies. The rise of 4.19 percent in the Dow for the last 12 months, for example, would translate to a loss of 3.48 percent in Japanese yen and a loss of 3.25 percent in German marks.
 
 
Months of Aftershocks
 Yesterday's decline in stocks was part of a continuing aftershock from the Fed's initial decision to raise interest rates on Feb. 4. The responses of the stock and bond markets have gone beyond what either the Fed or most traders had expected. Stock and bond traders began looking for signs of inflation in every freshly released economic report, even though nearly five months of economic data have indicated scant inflation.
Still, traders successfully pressured the Fed into three more rate increases, which have served to slow the economy, analysts say, and called into question the strength of companies' second-quarter earnings, to be reported next month.
Meanwhile, currency traders had noticed the slowing United States economy and the recovering European economies. Traders bet heavily on European currencies, especially the German mark, and against the dollar, lowering its value.
While currency intervention has important psychological ramifications, it has little practical effect. Even if the Treasury Department and the Fed spent all of the United States' foreign exchange reserves of about $44 billion, it would have little effect on a currency market with a daily trading volume that may exceed $1 trillion.
Spending all of the United States' reserves would be the equivalent of less than a nickel for every dollar traded in the currency markets. "Intervention is a Band-Aid when you need a tourniquet," said Chris Madell, a former currency trader who now heads Government bond trading at First Chicago Capital Markets.
The bond market also buckled yesterday. The price of the benchmark 30-year bond dropped sharply and the yield rose to 7.52 percent, from 7.40 percent on Thursday, the largest one-day rise since May 23.
But most of the rubble was in the stock market. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 6.83 points, to 442.80, and the Nasdaq composite index dropped 7.06 points, to 693.79. The last time the Nasdaq index closed below 700 was on July 22, 1993, when it ended at 695.52.
 
 
Grim From the Start
 News of the dollar's weakness sent the stock market tumbling at the opening of the session. All leading indexes plunged in the first half-hour of trading. Shortly after 11 A.M., the Dow fell more than 50 points, setting off the New York Stock Exchange's "circuit breakers" -- rules intended to slow high-speed computer-guided trading and cool off the market.
The New York Stock Exchange composite fell 3.74 points, to 244.55, with advancing stocks lagging behind declining issues by 383 to 1,896. The American Stock Exchange market value index fell 4.95 points, to 426.30.
Of the 30 component stocks that make up the Dow industrials, 26 declined, led by the Aluminum Company of America, which fell 2 1/4, to 72 1/2, on no immediate news that would account for the decline. Of the 500 component stocks that make up the S.& P. 500, 424 declined, led by AT&T, which fell 1 1/8, to 53 3/4, on no apparent news.
The most active stock, at 9.1 million shares, was Oracle Systems, a software developer, which rose 2, to 36 5/8, after reporting strong fourth-quarter earnings.
 In Tokyo, the Nikkei index of 225 issues fell 273.46 points, or 1.30 percent, to 20,766.75.

HEADLINE: Direct Flights From Haiti End as Sanctions Take Hold

BYLINE: By GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, June 24

 BODY:
The last direct flights from Haiti to the United States departed today as broader and tougher international economic sanctions took full effect.
The embargo is aimed at forcing the military to cede power so the exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, can return. All trade with Haiti is covered except in medicine, food and informational materials. 
 In addition to the tougher United Nations embargo enacted on May 21, the United States set the deadline on commercial air traffic between the two countries, as well as banning financial transactions. On Tuesday the Clinton Administration announced the additional step of freezing all American bank accounts of Haitians living in Haiti.
 
Last Flights Take Off
 But even as the last American commercial flights took off, diplomats here acknowledged that the measures might not be enough to bring about the return of Father Aristide.
Air France, for instance, has decided not to cancel its three flights a week to Haiti, providing a safety valve for the elite, who can afford to flee. They are generally seen as supporters of the military, which seized power in September 1991. French diplomats say they will study the airline situation daily.
If the sanctions fail to push the military from power, United States officials say that other punitive measures, short of military intervention, are being considered. But they failed to elaborate. In recent weeks Administration officials, including President Clinton, have refused to rule out the use of military force in Haiti.
"We have not made a lot of progress in three years," said a United States Embassy spokesman, Stanley Schrager, referring to negotiations to restore Father Aristide. "We're not naive about that. What we're trying to do is to get it right now."
Freezing the assets of all Haitians surprised many in the business community here.
Citibank and the Bank of Boston closed their branches here, but Emil Jonassaint, the provisional president under the military, issued a court order forcing the banks to open today.
The country's banking system is on the brink of collapse. During a meeting at the Central Bank two weeks ago, officials hinted that they would raise the money supply to $35 million. That move would be highly inflationary, because Haiti is running perilously low on hard currency.
So far there are no signs that new money has been printed, economists say.
Although the military has become more financially independent since the coup, largely through contraband and other illicit activities, Haitian analysts say they believe that wealthy businessmen have been quietly subsidizing the military payroll.
Claude Beaubeuf, a political scientist at Quiskeya University in Port-au-Prince, said the members of Haiti's tiny elite were torn. "They love the military because it has preserved their economic privilege for decades," he said. "But at the same time, they see the military loosing ground. They don't know what to do. In fact they are trapped."
The end of the American Airlines flights effectively prevents Haitians without visas from traveling to the United States. There are Air France flights to Martinique and Guadeloupe, where there are connecting flights to the United States, but without visas Haitians would not be allowed to enter the country.
Because the borders to the Dominican Republic were sealed by the embargo, Haitians may not travel to the adjacent country to fly to the United States from there. But the smuggling of fuel from the Dominican Republic, which shares the Caribbean island of Hispaniola with Haiti, has remained active, mostly at night.
At Port-au-Prince International Airport, the mood for the last few weeks has been chaotic as Haitians flew off to the United States before the ban on commercial air traffic took effect. Today, a line of travelers with huge suitcases and boxes snaked from the airline check-in counters through the sidewalk of the terminal.
At times tempers flared as people flocked to the airport as early as six hours before flight time. Throughout the week fistfights have broken out between travelers, and today a soldier was seen shoving a woman during a heated argument.
"I am leaving because I want to get out before I get stuck here," said Estimond Sifford, who lives in Miami and was visiting relatives here. "It's not fun being here."
Haiti's military leaders have remained defiant since the United Nations Security Council decided to tighten sanctions. But some Haitian leaders are convinced that the army leadership is trying to find a face-saving way out of this crisis.
"Members of the army are beginning to see that this commander is taking them nowhere," said Robert Malval, the country's nominal Prime Minister, referring to the leader of the junta, Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras. "I think any one from a lieutenant on up can dream of becoming a hero overnight."
 
Americans Urged to Leave
 While embassy officials recommended that all of the roughly 8,000 Americans living in Haiti leave by today, only about 2,700 have done so.
The last American Airlines flight out of the capital left about 5:30 P.M. The airport, which had been frenzied, was calm as relatives of travelers milled about waiting for taxis to take them home.
On a morning flight to Miami, the mood among passengers was calm and somber.
The plane was filled with a large number of children, many traveling alone. Clad in pretty lacy dresses and suits, they wore clear plastic pouches carrying their passports and instructions on who would meet them at the end of their journey.
"I hope the Americans come soon," said a woman passenger who declined to give her name.
"We have had it up to here," she said, running her hand across her chin.

HEADLINE: THE SUPREME COURT;
High Court, in a 5-4 Split, Limits Public Power on Private Property

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 24

 BODY:
In a substantial victory for advocates of private property rights, the Supreme Court today placed new limits on the ability of governments to require developers to set aside part of their property for environmental or other public uses.
The 5-to-4 decision, with a majority opinion by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, reflected a fundamental ideological division on a Court where curbing government land-use authority has long been a priority of the conservative Justices. The decision did not cast doubt on the Court's precedents upholding local governments' general zoning authority. 
 The Court held that requiring a public easement as a condition of permission to build or expand is an unconstitutional "taking" unless the government can show a "rough proportionality" between the requirement and the particular harm posed by the development, like increased traffic or a heightened danger of flooding.
The majority then applied that test to reject an Oregon city's requirement that the owner of a plumbing supply store, which is in a flood plain, make 10 percent of her land available for a drainage area, bicycle path and green space as a condition for approval to double the size of her store and pave the parking lot.
Reversing a decision by the Supreme Court of Oregon, the majority found that the city -- Tigard, a suburb of Portland -- had not justified the requirements with adequate precision. Tigard will have a chance to meet the majority's standard in further proceedings in the state courts.
Aside from the "rough proportionality" standard itself, which earlier Supreme Court decisions had suggested, the most important part of the decision today lay in the Court's directions for applying the new test. The Justices gave the city the burden of justifying its restrictions, a distinct and unexpected shift from current law under which the landowner seeking to challenge a land-use restriction has the burden of proving that the regulation would remove all or substantially all economic value from the property.
Justice John Paul Stevens, in a strongly worded dissenting opinion, which he took the unusual step of delivering from the bench, said the Court had "stumbled badly" in placing new constitutional hurdles in the path of land-use regulation.
Restrictions like Tigard's were simply "a species of business regulation that heretofore warranted a strong presumption of constitutional validity," Justice Stevens said, adding, "Property owners have surely found a new friend today."
Chief Justice Rehnquist's majority opinion was joined by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas.
Justices Harry A. Blackmun and Ruth Bader Ginsburg signed the dissenting opinion by Justice Stevens, while Justice David H. Souter filed a separate dissenting opinion.
The decision, Dolan v. City of Tigard, No. 93-518, was based on the takings clause of the Fifth Amendment, which provides that private property shall not be "taken for public use without just compensation."
"We see no reason why the takings clause of the Fifth Amendment, as much a part of the Bill of Rights as the First Amendment or Fourth Amendment, should be relegated to the status of a poor relation," the Chief Justice said in his majority opinion.
 
Seeks 'Effort to Quantify'
 He said that while "no precise mathematical calculation is required" to justify land-use restrictions, a city must make "some effort to quantify" its evidence on the relationship between the impact of the development and the requirement imposed on the landowner.
Tigard had made some fairly detailed studies, estimating that the enlarged store would generate 435 extra trips a day into the city's central business district. But Chief Justice Rehnquist said the city had failed to show how that additional traffic justified the requirement for the pedestrian and bike path.
The Chief Justice said that the city's assertion that the pathway "could offset some of the traffic demand" was only a "conclusory statement" with inadequate proof.
The case was brought by Florence Dolan, the owner of a family business, the A-Boy Supply Company on Main Street in Tigard. She was represented without charge in her constitutional challenge by Oregonians in Action, a property rights organization.
Outside Oregon, the case has been closely watched by property rights advocates, who cheered the outcome after years of frustrated expectations as the Court moved only incrementally toward embracing their point of view. "It's finally happened," said William H. Mellor 3d, general counsel of the Institute for Justice, a conservative group that filed a brief for Mrs. Dolan.
Calling the decision a "dramatic victory," he said its importance lay in the Court's recognition that "the ends can no longer justify the means in the regulation of land use."
Richard J. Lazarus, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis, who worked on the case for the city, said the standard the Court set today confirmed a trend rather than marking a sharp departure. "The proportionality test in isolation is perfectly fair," he said in an interview, adding that the troubling portion of the decision lay in its shifting of the burden of proof from the property owner to the government.
"In this area, you're invariably dealing with risk assessment, not with certainty," Professor Lazarus said. "What risks are you willing to take? That's what environmental protection is all about. You're trying to avoid irretrievable losses."
Environmental groups had also watched the case closely. John Echeverria, general counsel of the Audubon Society, said the ruling would make land-use decision-making more time-consuming and expensive for local governments, and probably also for developers, who will have to do more studies and supply more information.
"This is an extraordinary intrusion by the Court into the authority of local government," Mr. Echeverria said. "It elevates the interests of property owners over the interests of the community as a whole."
But another environmental lawyer, Tim Searchinger of the Environmental Defense Fund, said he thought the Court had set a test that local governments, including Tigard, would be able to meet. "Localities shouldn't be scared by this," he said.
 
Developmental Ban Allowed
 Mr. Searchinger said it was significant that the Court had held that while Tigard had not justified these precise restrictions, the city could have simply banned all development in its flood plain. Many local land-use ordinances prohibit rather than restrict development in flood plains, he said.
Regarding local governments' power to zone land, Chief Justice Rehnquist said that while "classifying entire areas of the city" as part of an overall land-use plan was a valid "legislative determination," the difference in this case was that the city had made not a general but an individual determination that a landowner must yield control over part of her property for permission to build.
The decision puts local governments to a two-part test. First, they must show that the conditions they seek to attach serve a "legitimate public purpose." Tigard met that test, the Chief Justice said, because preventing flooding and reducing traffic congestion were both valid purposes that were related to the development restrictions.
In his dissenting opinion, Justice Stevens said that the inquiry should stop at this phase unless the developer could show that the restriction was so "grossly disproportionate to the proposed development's adverse effects" as to cast doubt on the city's motives.
But the majority went on to establish the second level of inquiry, requiring the city to make "some sort of individualized determination" to justify the particular condition.

HEADLINE: THE BATTERED DOLLAR;
The Bourses Are Pounded; Rates Rise

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LONDON, June 24

 BODY:
If there were lingering doubts about how interconnected the world's financial markets have become and how powerful an effect they can have on the world's economies, this week's turmoil should have laid them to rest.
The turmoil encompassed a weakening dollar and plunging stock and bond prices. It washed indiscriminately over the major exchanges in Tokyo, London, Frankfurt and New York, seemingly oblivious to very real differences in national economic conditions. 
 At work are factors as diverse as rising commodity prices, which economists and investors around the world see as a precursor to inflation, and political instability in Japan, which is an impediment to progress in reducing that nation's trade surplus with the United States.
In Frankfurt, meanwhile, the selloff in the bond market has driven up long-term interest rates, perhaps endangering Germany's chances of pulling itself out of recession.
 
International Cooperation Needed
 The global nature of the problems has put a premium on international cooperation, economists said. The situation is certain to be at the top of the agenda at the meeting of leaders from the world's seven largest industrial democracies starting on July 7 in Naples.
But it remains unclear what action the Group of Seven nations might take, aside from jawboning -- urging the United States, which has made progress in bringing down its budget deficit, to cut it further and faster, or pressing Japan to buy more imports -- or endorsing more concerted intervention to prop up the dollar.
"In terms of the bond markets, there's not very much they can do about it except to stress that inflation fears are overdone," said Tapan Datta, a senior economist at the American Express Bank in London. "One of the things they can do is support the dollar. We haven't seen a sustained generalized intervention yet."
 
Bears on the Bourses
 In London today, stocks fell to their lowest level this year; the Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading shares plunged 65.8 points to close at 2,876.6. Shares also tumbled in Frankfurt, Paris and Tokyo.
Bond prices dropped in all the major markets, sending yields up substantially, although the selloff was tempered late in the day when central banks, seeking to stop the dollar's fall, bought the American currency.
The bottom line was bad news for just about everyone. The dollar's weakening has increased the chances that American interest rates will have to rise faster than they would otherwise, to minimize the risk that rising import prices will fuel inflation. The falling dollar has imperiled Japan's fragile economic recovery by making Japanese exports more expensive relative to American goods.
Falling bond prices mean higher long-term rates, and higher rates could choke off economic recovery in Germany and the rest of Europe.
 
German Rates Rise
 The yield on Germany's 10-year Government bonds has risen from 5.5 percent earlier this year to about 7.10 percent now. The increase in long-term yields has been even more pronounced elsewhere in Europe. Economists in Britain said rising long-term rates were already putting a crimp in what had been shaping up as a recovery in the housing market.
For investors and analysts outside the United States, the key question is whether the Clinton Administration is really dedicated to strengthening the dollar, thereby calming global financial markets, or whether it would like to keep the dollar weak to wring more trade concessions from Japan.
"The underlying economics of the dollar are quite good, but they're completely overrun by the political situation, which is interpreted in a very negative fashion in the markets," said Steve Barrow, an economist at Chemical Bank in London.
Mr. Barrow said currency traders were not yet convinced that Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen was willing to support the dollar aggressively -- meaning Europe is likely to face falling stock and bond prices and growing questions about its ability to drag itself out of recession.
"The situation doesn't just ripple, it bangs into the European markets," Mr. Barrow said. "We're in a situation now where it's in everybody's interests to have a stronger dollar. Either the G-7 nations don't see it that way, or they do see it that way but can't get themselves together to do something on the dollar. I don't think they see the seriousness of the situation."

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Court Ruling Limiting Governments' Power Over Property

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 24

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the Supreme Court's 5-to-4 decision today in Dolan v. City of Tigard, setting new limits on the ability of local governments to require property owners to give up part of their land for public purposes in return for permission to build or expand. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist's majority opinion was joined by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy, and Clarence Thomas. Justice John Paul Stevens wrote a dissenting opinion that Justices Harry A. Blackmun and Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined. Justice David H. Souter also wrote a dissenting opinion, not excerpted here. 
 
FROM THE DECISION
By Chief Justice Rehnquist
 Petitioner challenges the decision of the Oregon Supreme Court, which held that the city of Tigard could condition the approval of her building permit on the dedication of a portion of her property for flood control and traffic improvements. (1993). We granted certiorari to resolve a question left open by our decision in Nollan v. California Coastal Comm'n, (1987), of what is the required degree of connection between the exactions imposed by the city and the projected impacts of the proposed development.
 
. . .
 Pursuant to the state's requirements, the city of Tigard, a community of some 30,000 residents on the southwest edge of Portland, developed a comprehensive plan and codified it in its Community Development Code (C.D.C.). The C.D.C. requires property owners in the area zoned central business district to comply with a 15% open space and landscaping requirement, which limits total site coverage, including all structures and paved parking, to 85% of the parcel. After the completion of a transportation study that identified congestion in the Central Business District as a particular problem, the city adopted a plan for a pedestrian/bicycle pathway intended to encourage alternatives to automobile transportation for short trips. The C.D.C. requires that new development facilitate this plan by dedicating land for pedestrian pathways where provided for in the pedestrian/bicycle pathway plan.
The city also adopted a master drainage plan (drainage plan). The drainage plan noted that flooding occurred in several areas along Fanno Creek, including areas near petitioner's property. The drainage plan also established that the increase in impervious surfaces associated with continued urbanization would exacerbate these flooding problems. To combat these risks, the drainage plan suggested a series of improvements to the Fanno Creek Basin, including channel excavation in the area next to petitioner's property. Other recommendations included ensuring that the flood plain remains free of structures and that it be preserved as greenways to minimize flood damage to structures. The drainage plan concluded that the cost of these improvements should be shared based on both direct and indirect benefits, with property owners along the waterways paying more due to the direct benefit that they would receive.
Petitioner Florence Dolan owns a plumbing and electric supply store located on Main Street in the central business district of the city. The store covers approximately 9,700 square feet on the eastern side of a 1.67-acre parcel, which includes a gravel parking lot.
Fanno Creek flows through the southwestern corner of the lot and along its western boundary. The year-round flow of the creek renders the area within the creek's 100-year flood plain virtually unusable for commercial development. The city's comprehensive plan includes the Fanno Creek flood plain as part of the city's greenway system.
Petitioner applied to the city for a permit to redevelop the site. Her proposed plans called for nearly doubling the size of the store to 17,600 square feet, and paving a 39-space parking lot. . . . The proposed expansion and intensified use are consistent with the city's zoning scheme in the central business district.
The City Planning Commission granted petitioner's permit application subject to conditions imposed by the city's C.D.C.
 
. . .
 Thus, the commission required that petitioner dedicate the portion of her property lying within the 100-year flood plain for improvement of a storm drainage system along Fanno Creek and that she dedicate an additional 15-foot strip of land adjacent to the flood plain as a pedestrian/bicycle pathway. The dedication required by that condition encompasses approximately 7,000 square feet, or roughly 10% of the property.
 
. . .
 Petitioner appealed to the Land Use Board of Appeals (L.U.B.A.) on the ground that the city's dedication requirements were not related to the proposed development, and, therefore, those requirements constituted an uncompensated taking of their property under the Fifth Amendment. In evaluating the Federal taking claim, L.U.B.A. assumed that the city's findings about the impacts of the proposed development were supported by substantial evidence.
 
. . .
 The Oregon Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting petitioner's contention that in Nollan v. California Coastal Comm'n, (1987), we had abandoned the "reasonable relationship" test in favor of a stricter "essential nexus" test. (1992). The Oregon Supreme Court affirmed. (1993). The court also disagreed with petitioner's contention that the Nollan Court abandoned the "reasonably related" test. Instead, the court read Nollan to mean that an "exaction is reasonably related to an impact if the exaction serves the same purpose that a denial of the permit would serve." The court decided that both the pedestrian/bicycle pathway condition and the storm drainage dedication had an essential nexus to the development of the proposed site. Therefore, the court found the conditions to be reasonably related to the impact of the expansion of petitioner's business. We granted certiorari because of an alleged conflict between the Oregon Supreme Court's decision and our decision in Nollan.
The Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution, made applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, provides: "(N)or shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation." One of the principal purposes of the Takings Clause is "to bar Government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole." Armstrong v. United States, (1960). Without question, had the city simply required petitioner to dedicate a strip of land along Fanno Creek for public use, rather than conditioning the grant of her permit to redevelop her property on such a dedication, a taking would have occurred. Such public access would deprive petitioner of the right to exclude others, "one of the most essential sticks in the bundle of rights that are commonly characterized as property." Kaiser Aetna v. United States (1979).
On the other side of the ledger, the authority of state and local governments to engage in land use planning has been sustained against constitutional challenge as long ago as our decision in Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., (1926).
The sort of land use regulations . . . cited, however, differ in two relevant particulars from the present case. First, they involved essentially legislative determinations classifying entire areas of the city, whereas here the city made an adjudicative decision to condition petitioner's application for a building permit on an individual parcel. Second, the conditions imposed were not simply a limitation on the use petitioner might make of her own parcel, but a requirement that she deed portions of the property to the city. . . . Under the well-settled doctrine of "unconstitutional conditions," the government may not require a person to give up a constitutional right, here the right to receive just compensation when property is taken for a public use in exchange for a discretionary benefit conferred by the government where the property sought has little or no relationship to the benefit.
In evaluating petitioner's claim, we must first determine whether the "essential nexus" exists between the "legitimate state interest" and the permit condition exacted by the city.
 
. . .
 Undoubtedly, the prevention of flooding along Fanno Creek and the reduction of traffic congestion in the central business district qualify as the type of legitimate public purposes we have upheld.
 
. . .
 The same may be said for the city's attempt to reduce traffic congestion by providing for alternative means of transportation.
 
. . .
 The second part of our analysis requires us to determine whether the degree of the exactions demanded by the city's permit conditions bear the required relationship to the projected impact of petitioner's proposed development.
 
. . .
 Since state courts have been dealing with this question a good deal longer than we have, we turn to representative decisions made by them.
In some states, very generalized statements as to the necessary connection between the required dedication and the proposed development seem to suffice. . . . We think this standard is too lax to adequately protect petitioner's right to just compensation if her property is taken for a public purpose.
Other state courts require a very exacting correspondence, described as the "specifi(c) and uniquely attributable" test. . . . We do not think the Federal Constitution requires such exacting scrutiny, given the nature of the interests involved.
 
. . .
 We think the "reasonable relationship" test adopted by a majority of the state courts is closer to the Federal constitutional norm than either of those previously discussed. But we do not adopt it as such. . . . We think a term such as "rough proportionality" best encapsulates what we hold to be the requirement of the Fifth Amendment. No precise mathematical calculation is required, but the city must make some sort of individualized determination that the required dedication is related both in nature and extent to the impact of the proposed development.
 
. . .
 We see no reason why the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment, as much a part of the Bill of Rights as the First Amendment or Fourth Amendment, should be relegated to the status of a poor relation.
 
. . .
 It is axiomatic that increasing the amount of impervious surface will increase the quantity and rate of storm water flow from petitioner's property. Therefore, keeping the flood plain open and free from development would likely confine the pressures on Fanno Creek created by petitioner's development. In fact, because petitioner's property lies within the central business district, the Community Development Code already required that petitioner leave 15% of it as open space and the undeveloped flood plain would have nearly satisfied that requirement. But the city demanded more.
 
. . .
 We conclude that the findings upon which the city relies do not show the required reasonable relationship between the floodplain easement and the petitioner's proposed new building.
With respect to the pedestrian/bicycle pathway, we have no doubt that the city was correct in finding that the larger retail sales facility proposed by petitioner will increase traffic on the streets of the central business district. The city estimates that the proposed development would generate roughly 435 additional trips per day. Dedications for streets, sidewalks, and other public ways are generally reasonable exactions to avoid excessive congestion from a proposed property use. But on the record before us, the city has not met its burden of demonstrating that the additional number of vehicle and bicycle trips generated by the petitioner's development reasonably relate to the city's requirement for a dedication of the pedestrian/bicycle pathway easement. The city simply found that the creation of the pathway "could offset some of the traffic demand . . . and lessen the increase in traffic congestion."
 
. . .
 Cities have long engaged in the commendable task of land use planning, made necessary by increasing urbanization particularly in metropolitan areas such as Portland. The city's goals of reducing flooding hazards and traffic congestion, and providing for public greenways, are laudable, but there are outer limits to how this may be done.
 
. . .

FROM THE DISSENT
By Justice Stevens
 The record does not tell us the dollar value of petitioner Florence Dolan's interest in excluding the public from the greenway adjacent to her hardware business. The mountain of briefs that the case has generated nevertheless makes it obvious that the pecuniary value of her victory is far less important than the rule of law that this case has been used to establish. It is unquestionably an important case.
 
. . .
 The Court is correct in concluding that the city may not attach arbitrary conditions to a building permit or to a variance even when it can rightfully deny the application outright. I also agree that state court decisions dealing with ordinances that govern municipal development plans provide useful guidance in a case of this kind. Yet the Court's description of the doctrinal underpinnings of its decision, the phrasing of its fledgling test of "rough proportionality," and the application of that test to this case run contrary to the traditional treatment of these cases and break considerable and unpropitious new ground.
 
. . .
 The Court recognizes as an initial matter that the city's conditions satisfy the "essential nexus" requirement announced in Nollan v. California Coastal Comm'n, (1987), because they serve the legitimate interests in minimizing floods and traffic congestions. The Court goes on, however, to erect a new constitutional hurdle in the path of these conditions. In addition to showing a rational nexus to a public purpose that would justify an outright denial of the permit, the city must also demonstrate "rough proportionality" between the harm caused by the new land use and the benefit obtained by the condition. The Court also decides for the first time that the city has the burden of establishing the constitutionality of its conditions by making an "individualized determination" that the condition in question satisfies the proportionality requirement.
 
. . .
 The Court has made a serious error by abandoning the traditional presumption of constitutionality and imposing a novel burden of proof on a city implementing an admittedly valid comprehensive land use plan. Even more consequential than its incorrect disposition of this case, however, is the Court's resurrection of a species of substantive due process analysis that it firmly rejected decades ago.
 
. . .
 In our changing world one thing is certain: uncertainty will characterize predictions about the impact of new urban developments on the risks of floods, earthquakes, traffic congestion, or environmental harms. When there is doubt concerning the magnitude of those impacts, the public interest in averting them must outweigh the private interest of the commercial entrepreneur. If the government can demonstrate that the conditions it has imposed in a land-use permit are rational, impartial and conducive to fulfilling the aims of a valid land-use plan, a strong presumption of validity should attach to those conditions. The burden of demonstrating that those conditions have unreasonably impaired the economic value of the proposed improvement belongs squarely on the shoulders of the party challenging the state action's constitutionality. That allocation of burdens has served us well in the past. The Court has stumbled badly today by reversing it.

HEADLINE: THE BATTERED DOLLAR;
A Subtle Game That May Not Work

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
Currency intervention is a subtle game, and one that does not always work. That was clear yesterday, when the dollar slipped, even after the Federal Reserve and 15 other central banks bought billions of dollars on the world's foreign exchange markets to prop up the American currency.
The process of intervention itself is not complex. Unlike interest rates, which are set independently by the Federal Reserve, currency intervention policy is set by the Treasury, in consultation with the Fed. Once the Treasury approves an action, traders at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York call up the major banks that deal in currencies and place orders to buy or sell dollars in return for foreign currencies.
 
Process Akin to Judo
 But while the actions are straightforward, the impact is anything but. The process is more akin to judo than boxing, because the central banker uses intervention to divert the force of the market against itself. And if a country is not firm in its footing and confident in its strategy, intervention can well backfire. 
 "It hasn't been the Treasury's finest hour," said Roger M. Kubarych, a former Federal Reserve official who is now general manager of Henry Kaufman & Company, a money management firm. "It looked very tactical without an obvious strategy."
Academic economists have long argued that currency intervention is a weak tool at best, no substitute for policies that affect fundamental economic factors like trade flows and countries' interest rates.
Intervention may be useful in a crisis to restart markets that may have been temporarily frozen by panic. In March, for example, after the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio, the leading party's presidential candidate, the Bank of Mexico intervened to support the peso.
 
Hope: To Scare Speculators
 Central bankers generally also hope that intervention can scare off speculative traders who follow market trends but have little fundamental conviction. If an intervention surprises the market, traders will retreat from their losing bets.
This is where the martial arts of intervention come in: the central banks look to hit a market when it appears weak. That may explain why the Treasury chose to intervene on a summer Friday when many traders would be on vacation. But amid sharp drops of the dollar in Asia, the market was quite active.
As the currency markets have grown, intervention of this sort has become more difficult. These days, interventions involve buying or selling several billion dollars at a time. While that sounds like a lot, it is dwarfed by daily foreign exchange trading well above $1 trillion.
In the United States, the Treasury and the Fed generally split the costs of intervention. Before today's move the Federal Reserve owned $23 billion in yen and marks, and the Treasury's Exchange Stabilization Fund owned $21 billion in the Japanese and German currencies. The Fed also has agreements to borrow an additional $32 billion from other central banks.
 
Big Money Needed
 Many economists argue that for an intervention to have more than a psychological effect, it must be by the tens or hundreds of billions.
"Now the central banks are only spitting in the ocean," said William Poole, a Brown University monetary economist. "If they decided to spend $200 billion or $400 billion or some other big number, and they announced they had assembled a fund of $1 trillion, or some great big number, then they could raise the level of the ocean and make a difference."
Such a large intervention, of course, would put taxpayers at substantial risk if it were not successful and the dollars the central banks bought fell in value. But economists have long argued that if a country uses intervention properly, it should profit, buying its currency when it is cheap and selling when it is dear. Indeed, currency intervention is the ultimate in insider trading, because a central bank could buy a currency with the knowledge that it will soon take action to raise its value, raising interest rates for example.
In 1992, European governments lost billions of dollars when they propped up the value of the British pound to keep it within Europe's semi-fixed exchange rate system, defying economic fundamentals. The onslaught by speculators and more conservative investors like mutual funds, which sold pounds, overwhelmed the central banks' action.
 
Credibility at Risk?
 While the dollar is not so shaky as the pound was two years ago, many specialists still wonder whether the Treasury is risking the same sort of credibility crisis that bedeviled Europe. In particular, if the Clinton Administration wants the dollar to rise it will have to signal that it is comfortable with raising interest rates further, or risk that yesterday's action be taken as a sign of weakness.
"As a substitute for a genuine change in policy, intervention may be counterproductive." Mr. Poole said. "If you don't follow through, people will say you aren't facing up to the situation."
As a result, some see intervention as a no-win game for governments where the benefits are transitory and the costs are high. Indeed, the Reagan Administration avoided it for most of its first term. That changed, however, in 1985 when Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d initiated coordinated international action to push down the surging dollar and set in motion the decade-long slide that has continued until now.

HEADLINE: Frozen Embryos' Fate Awaits L.I. Custody Battle

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MINEOLA, L.I., June 23

 BODY:
In the first case of its kind in New York State, a Long Island couple who struggled for years to have a baby and then divorced are battling over the fate of five frozen human embryos.
Maureen Kent Kass, 36, of Amityville is seeking control of the embryos so she can have them implanted and give birth. Her former husband, Steven Kass, 33, is seeking to have the embryos destroyed. 
 The case raises legal and ethical questions brought about, in large part, by technologies that allow embryos to exist outside the body indefinitely. It may set a legal precedent regarding whether frozen embryos are to be treated as property or children in a divorce settlement.
"What are they?" Mrs. Kass's lawyer, Vincent F. Stempel, asked. "Are they to be considered people, or are they property?" To cover both possibilities, he has filed for both custody and "exclusive possession" of the embryos.
Should Mrs. Kass prevail, both Mr. Stempel and Mr. Kass's lawyer, Linda T. Armatti-Epstein, said Mr. Kass could be responsible for the financial support of children born long after his divorce.
Mrs. Kass describes herself as devoutly Roman Catholic, and even though the church opposes in vitro fertilization, she argues that since the couple underwent the process during a sanctified marriage, it would be a violation of her religious beliefs to destroy the embryos that resulted.
"It's morally and ethically wrong to destroy a human life," Mrs. Kass said in a recent interview. "It's just wrong for me, This is just the right thing to do. They are already fertilized. That's a potential for life. They should not be destroyed because he changed his mind."
She said she would not undergo in vitro fertilization with sperm from an anonymous donor. "I went through a lot to have a baby," she said. "I don't want any part of that, and these embryos are already here."
But Mr. Kass takes a different view.
"It's not that I changed my mind, it's that my wife filed a divorce against me," he said. "I'm being forced into a situation. I'm being held hostage until I do what they want. It's unconscionable."
Referring to the embryos, Mr. Kass said: "They are just two cells. An insect has more life than two cells. They are not even attached to a uterus yet. These embryos should be destroyed."
The five embryos were created in May 1993. In a typical in vitro process, eggs taken from the woman are fertilized in a dish with sperm processed from the man's semen. After two or three days in an incubator at body temperature, one or more embryos are implanted in the woman's uterus, or frozen for later use.
The Kasses' five embryos are being preserved at Mather Memorial Hospital in Port Jefferson, in tanks of liquid nitrogen at a temperature of minus 196 degrees Centigrade (minus 321 degrees Fahrenheit), and they can exist in that state indefinitely, doctors said.
 
Court Protects Embryos
 In the couple's divorce settlement in May, they agreed to let Justice Angelo D. Roncallo of State Supreme Court decide the fate of the embryos. He is expected to rule in the next few weeks on their status and on a petition by Mr. Stempel to give the embryos legal representation.
Last July, Mr. Stempel got a restraining order from the judge barring all but essential medical staff from approaching the embryos.
In a similar case in Knoxville, Tenn., Davis v. Davis, the Tennessee Supreme Court gave seven embryos to the father, Junior Lewis Davis, who is said to have destroyed them.
But the Davis case has one critical difference. Mr. Davis's former wife, Mary Sue, did not want to have the embryos implanted in herself. Instead, she wanted to donate them to an infertile couple.
As a result, said Dr. Bonnie Steinbock, the author of "Life Before Birth: The Moral and Legal Status of Embryos and Fetuses" (Oxford University Press, 1992), Mrs. Davis's right to procreate was not at issue, as it is for Mrs. Kass.
The Kass case, Dr. Steinbock said, pits Mrs. Kass's right to have a child against Mr. Kass's right not to have a child. "What we have here," she said, "is a conflict of reproductive rights."
In the Davis case, the court said fertilized embryos could be used over the objection of a parent if there were "no reasonable alternatives" to bring about a pregnancy. Mr. Stempel is arguing that Mrs. Kass meets this criteria because of her age and because she is sterile.
Mrs. Kass said her mother took the synthetic hormone DES, which was widely used to prevent miscarriage and which, in some cases, left the patients' children infertile.
"If I was pregnant, and he didn't want it, there is nothing he could do about that," she said of Mr. Kass. "It's my right to have a baby. Why can't I have these embryos?"
The Kasses began in vitro fertilization in 1989, Mr. Kass said. After 10 unsuccessful attempts, a fertilized egg was successfully implanted in Mrs. Kass in June 1993. But the pregnancy resulted in a miscarriage.
 
Sister Fails as Surrogate
 In the couple's final attempt to have a child through in vitro fertilization, Mrs. Kass's sister Eileen Kent Smith, a secretary from Garden City, was used as a surrogate, but the egg failed to develop in Ms. Smith.
Mr. Kass said he was an engineer at Machinery Mountings, a Farmingdale company. Mrs. Kass said she was unemployed and had worked as a secretary for her husband.
Mr. Kass lives in a house in Amityville where the couple had lived when married. Mrs. Kass now lives with her family in New Hyde Park.

HEADLINE: California Seeks Solutions To Prevent Insurance Crisis

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT 

 BODY:
As more insurance companies cut back or even abandon their homeowners business in California because of earthquake risks, the state's officials are groping for solutions to prevent an insurance crisis that could derail California's economic recovery.
Gov. Pete Wilson and his insurance adviser, Marjorie Burke, have scheduled a meeting on Monday with executives from 18 insurance companies to discuss the problem and the state's role in keeping earthquake insurance available to homeowners. 
 California's Insurance Commissioner, John Garamendi, proposed on Wednesday that Governor Wilson declare a moratorium to stop companies from refusing to renew homeowner policies.
"The problem in California is not just about insurance companies," said Robert Pike, general counsel for Allstate Insurance, "it involves the California economy, which is just beginning to see an upturn, led by new housing starts."
Mr. Garamendi said a moratorium was needed to prevent an unmanageable surge of business into the state-run insurance program, called the FAIR plan, which Mr. Garamendi has proposed to make available to homeowners throughout the state.
FAIR, an acronym for Fair Access to Insurance Requirements, was created in California to cover homeowners only in areas vulnerable to brush fires, where insurance companies would not issue policies.
Last week Farmers Insurance, the third-largest insurer in the state, with about a million homeowner policies, said it would not accept applications from new customers in California. "We studied our experience and found that our risk of loss from earthquakes was more than would be prudent," said John C. Millen, a spokesman for Farmers.
Because California law requires companies offering homeowner insurance to also offer earthquake insurance, the only way Farmers could reduce its exposure to earthquake loss in California was to stop accepting new homeowner customers. Its exposure in California was one reason that A. M. Best, an insurance rating company, lowered its rating last week to A-, the fourth highest of 15 ratings, from A, the third highest.
Before the action by Farmers, Twentieth Century Insurance, a company based in Woodland Hills, Calif., that suffered severe losses from the Los Angeles earthquake in January, was given permission by California insurance regulators to stop renewing policies on its more than 200,000 homeowner policies. TIG Holdings, an insurer based in New York, is also cutting back its business in California because of earthquake risks and what it considers to be inadequate profits.
Other companies have been trying to cut back on their homeowner business by instructing agents not to seek new business or changing their standards to stop accepting older houses, said Steve Young, director of the Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers of California.
 
Too Many Applications
 The withdrawal of some companies is creating problems for the two largest insurers in the state, State Farm, which has a market share of nearly 26 percent, and Allstate, which has about 15 percent. Both said they were receiving more new applications than they would like. And executives at both companies said the losses from the recent earthquake -- $1.3 billion at State Farm and $950 million at Allstate -- showed that higher premiums were justified.
Currently earthquake coverage costs an average of about $2 for $1,000 of insurance, with a deductible requiring homeowners to assume losses of 10 percent of the insured value.
"When the pool of insurance companies shrinks, but the number of people needing insurance stays constant or grows, it forces the remaining companies to take on greater risk, and puts them in a position where they are under pressure to place moratoriums on accepting new business," said Steven Goldstein, a spokesman for the Insurance Information Institute, based in New York.
So far, State Farm and Allstate have not declared moratoriums, though both want to hold their business stable in the state. State Farm, despite efforts to keep its new business from exceeding the amount of business it loses through attrition, has added 29,000 additional customers so far this year, raising its total earthquake insurance by $4 billion, to $66 billion.
"We do not want to take actions that would create further problems, but we cannot afford to be the only game in town," said Jerry Choate, president of Allstate.
Kim M. Brunner, a vice president of State Farm, said opening the FAIR plan to all California homeowners was not a wise move because it undermined companies' efforts to limit their risk. Insurers are required to cover the FAIR plan losses, and those payments are not covered by reinsurance, the insurance that insurance companies buy to protect themselves from heavy losss.
 
Alternative Plan Proposed
 Mr. Pike of Allstate said his company had discussed with California officials an alternative plan, similar to that developed in Florida after Hurricane Andrew in 1992 caused huge losses and some insurance companies wanted to cut back on their business in the state.
The plan envisioned by Mr. Pike could include a moratorium on moves by insurance companies to leave the market, and the creation of a new organization for earthquake insurance to create a pool of money to cover earthquake claims, ideally without being taxed by the Federal Government. If that pool is not enough, the new organization could sell bonds and, as a last resort, collect additional money from insurance companies.
Insurance company executives, as well as California's insurance commissioner and legislators in the state, are strong supporters of Federal legislation to protect the public and insurance companies from devastating losses caused by big disasters. So far that legislation has more than 150 supporters, but its advocates say the prospects for its passage this year are not bright.

HEADLINE: Prices of Bonds Tumble As Dollar Keeps Falling

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Bond prices tumbled yesterday, falling in sympathy with the dollar despite a concerted effort by the United States and its economic allies to prop up the currency.
The Treasury's 30-year bond fell 110/32 of a point, while its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, surged to 7.52 percent from 7.40 percent. Shorter-term and intermediate Treasury issues also fell. 
 Traders said Treasury prices would continue to follow the dollar down as long as there was no stronger move by the Clinton Administration to support the dollar. They noted that the weakening dollar put pressure on the Federal Reserve to push up interest rates to support the dollar.
Yesterday, the Federal Reserve and at least 16 other central banks, including Germany's Bundesbank and the Bank of Japan, bought $2 billion to $5 billion in the markets in an effort to prop up the dollar after it fell as low as 100.05 Japanese yen early in the day.
But traders said the intervention failed. "The dollar is headed downward and no amount of intervention is going to stop it," a government-securities trader said.
In late New York trading, the dollar ended at 100.65 yen, down sharply from 101.40 yen on Thursday despite the central bank effort to support the currency.
 Indeed, several traders said the Fed would need to push up short-term interest rates by half a percentage point, or even a full point, to send a clear message to the foreign exchange market. But they doubted the Fed was ready to make that move.
"I do not think the Fed will move to tighten immediately just in response to the dollar," said David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company. "I think they will wait until domestic considerations justify another tightening move, since the economy has adjusted to the earlier four moves."
So far this year, the Fed has pushed up short-term interest rates to slow the nation's economic growth and relieve any inflationary pressures.
Yesterday, a senior Treasury official said the Administration preferred a stronger dollar. But traders said the statement lacked bite, especially since the official declined to be identified.
 
No Relief Seen
 In the week ahead, traders say, bond prices are unlikely to gain any ground while the dollar is threatened. The dollar's weakness also discourages foreign investors, who worry that dollar-denominated investments will decline in value relative to other currencies.
"I would have to say the dollar is going to be the single, biggest factor next week," said Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc.
Before yesterday's currency market intervention, analysts and traders speculated that any plan to support the dollar would most likely include a further increase in American interest rates.
"But a quarter-point or a half-point rise won't do anything" for the dollar, said Marilyn Schaja, money market economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. "And, if it isn't warranted by domestic considerations, it's not going to happen."
Economic reports next week may provide evidence of whether the Fed can justify raising rates again on the ground that the economy is still expanding too quickly. These include reports on home sales in May, as well as consumer confidence in June. Also, the Government will issue its leading economic indicators.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Lumber Falls Again on Fear Of Decline in Construction

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Lumber fell yesterday for the fifth time in six days as the prospect of rising interest rates reduced demand from lumberyards.
On other markets, crude oil declined amid concern about rising imports, which helped push the Commodity Research Bureau's index down 0.43, to 229.98, its fifth declining day. Precious metals rose with the dollar's slide and pork bellies rebounded on signs that a supply glut may be easing. 
 Demand for lumber has fallen this week, traders said, as the yield on Treasury bonds rose to a six-week high. Lumberyards are reluctant to build inventories for fear that higher interest rates will curtail new housing construction.
 
Falls to Trading Limit
 "It's the backdrop against what everybody's trading," said Burrle Elmore, editor of the Random Lengths lumber industry report based in Eugene, Ore.. "Nobody's panicking yet, but they're aware that with each uptick in rates there are a few more buyers knocked out of the housing markets."
Lumber for July delivery at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange fell the $10 daily trading limit to close at $349.50 for 1,000 board feet.
Crude oil fell amid concern that surging United States imports means there will be more than enough supplies to satisfy demand.
August crude fell 10 cents, to $19.32 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. July unleaded gasoline fell 0.52 cent, to 53.97 cents a gallon, while July heating oil lost 0.29 cent, to 50.39 cents a gallon.
Precious metals rose as the dollar declined in spite of a concerted effort by the world's central banks to lift the sagging currency.
August gold rose $1.40, to $392.90 an ounce, while July silver rose 1.5 cents, to $5.40 an ounce on the Commodity Exchange. July platinum fell $1.90, to $403.70 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Pork bellies rebounded from a slide yesterday amid signs that farmers are selling fewer hogs for slaughter, helping to reduce an oversupply.
Pork bellies for July delivery rose 0.525 cent to close at 40.525 cents a pound at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Court Rejects G.M. Pickup Coupon Plan

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER 

 BODY:
A Texas appeals court threw out a tentative settlement yesterday that would have given $1,000 coupons to owners of the General Motors pickup trucks that are suspected of posing a fire hazard in side-collision accidents, describing the plan as having little value for consumers.
The court said that because the coupons could only be applied toward the purchase of a new G.M. pickup, they required current pickup owners to make a substantial purchase to be useful. 
 "It is questionable whether a certificate that requires a person to spend from $7,000 to $33,000 for a discretionary, nonessential purchase in order to receive a $1,000 discount on that purchase has any value at all," the court said, citing the price range of new G.M. pickups.
 
 
Class-Action Suit
 The plan was intended to settle a class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of 645,000 people in Texas who own full-sized Chevrolet or GMC pickup trucks manufactured from 1973 to 1986. Car safety advocates are also appealing a similar settlement agreement affecting about four million pickup owners nationwide that is before a Federal court in Philadelphia.
A spokesman for G.M., Ed Lechtzin, said in a statement that the company would seek to have the settlement plan reinstated. "We're disappointed by the Texas Court of Appeals ruling," Mr. Lechtzin said. "G.M. continues to believe that the settlement is a good one."
 
 
Recall Was Requested
 Last year, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration asked the General Motors Corporation to recall the pickups voluntarily, maintaining that the placement of the vehicles' fuel tanks outside the main frames posed a fire risk in side collisions. The auto maker denied the assertion and refused the request.
The rebate plan was intended to cover only economic losses that might result from any reduction in the trucks' resale value. Those participating in the proposed settlement could still seek damages for further injuries.
Analysts said that if all the owners took advantage of the $1,000 offer, the company's obligations could total $5 billion to $6 billion. But G.M. has said that the settlement will not be a financial drain on the company.

HEADLINE: G.M. Plan For Idled Workers

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DETROIT, June 24

 BODY:
The General Motors Corporation is offering some of its idled hourly workers up to $60,000 to move to four plants where jobs are available.
The offer is the latest in a series of attempts by G.M. to plug a perennial drain on its coffers: members of the United Automobile Workers union who draw full wages for not working. The U.A.W. negotiated that benefit as part of a 1990 contract with G.M., to discourage the company from laying off workers. 
 Under the terms of the 1993 contract, G.M. can generally force laid-off workers to take new jobs only if those jobs are within 50 miles of their old ones. As a result, G.M. has resorted to a series of sweeteners to induce its workers to move or retire.
 
 
$25,000 'Signing Bonus'
 Through the new offer, G.M. is trying to move workers to its plant in Arlington, Tex., which makes rear-wheel-drive cars like the Chevrolet Caprice; its plant in Shreveport, La., which makes small pickups; its plant in Janesville, Wis., which builds full-size sport utility vehicles, including the Chevrolet Suburban, and its plant in Defiance, Ohio, which casts iron for engine blocks and other components.
Under the terms of the deal, which has been available to some workers since April, employees who decide to move will receive a $25,000 "signing bonus," Charles C. Licari, a spokesman for G.M., said. They will then be reimbursed for some moving expenses, and will receive additional bonuses after the first and second years at their new jobs.
Workers who move give up their seniority rights, which among other things determine which assignments they receive and which shifts they work. They also give up their "recall rights," which usually guarantee that workers who move can return to their old plants if jobs open up.
Mr. Licari said some workers had elected to move, but he declined to say how many. He said the company had not set a date for ending the offer.
A spokesman for the union, Reg McGhee, also said he did not know how many members had accepted the offer.
About 2,400 of G.M.'s 250,000 hourly workers are laid off and have the "protected status" that guarantees them full wages, the company said. Another 2,750 workers are on "indefinite layoff," drawing about 70 percent of their gross pay through a combination of payments from the auto maker and unemployment insurance. After 36 weeks on indefinite layoff, the workers attain protected status.
At the end of 1993, G.M. had about 3,900 workers with protected status and another 7,600 on indefinite layoff, Mr. Licari said.
In addition, other laid-off workers have promised that they will retire within two years, in exchange for 85 percent of their gross pay and a guarantee that G.M. will not force them to accept a job in the interim. Mr. Licari said he did not know how many workers were in that category.
The 1993 contract also forced G.M. to set aside nearly $4 billion to pay laid-off workers through 1996, up from slightly more than $3 billion under the 1990 contract.
The new offer is aimed at workers with protected status who were laid off from five plants, in Van Nuys, Calif.; Wentzville, Mo.; Lordstown, Ohio; Danville, Ill., and Indianapolis.
G.M.'s common shares fell 12.5 cents today, to $50.625, on the New York Stock Exchange. More than 2.2 million shares changed hands.

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
Term Trusts Are Cheap. Are They a Bargain?

BYLINE: By Francis Flaherty 

 BODY:
IF it's darkest before the dawn, then here comes the sun for the troubled closed-end bond funds known as term trusts.
These trusts strive both to return investors' stakes when they liquidate, generally 5 to 15 years after the public offering, and to furnish high monthly yields in the meantime. To do this, managers borrow money and variously invest in adjustable-rate mortgages, zero-coupon bonds, corporate debt and such arcana as interest-only strips and inverse floaters. 
 As interest rates rose this year, the trusts were pounded. Many original investors must now deal with falling dividends and share levels that may not regain the offering price, typically $10 or $15. "They haven't done well as a group," said Peter Madlem, editor of Cappiello's Closed-Fund Digest in Santa Barbara, Calif. (805) 565-5651. "I don't think any of them has fulfilled expectations," agreed Thomas Herzfeld, publisher of Herzfeld's Guide to Closed-End Funds (800) 854-3863.
In fact, many trusts are in such disesteem they are selling at large discounts to the value of their underlying securities, measured as net asset value per share. Mr. Herzfeld recently computed that about 30 taxable term trusts were selling at an average 2.84 percent discount. At Thursday's close, investors who paid $10 a share faced such prices as $6.625 for the Hyperion 1999 Term Trust and $8.75 for the Blackrock 1998 Term Trust. The net asset values are figured weekly on Thursday's close.
There's more. Last fall, investors sued Hyperion Capital over the performance of the 1999 fund. In April, Piper Capital reduced the monthly dividend on all five of its American Adjustable term trusts; the 1996 trust, for instance, now pays 3 cents, not 4 cents, a share.
And through it all, critics mutter that some brokers soft-pedaled the trusts' risks. "Often, they were sold as '$10 a share, 10 percent yield for 10 years and your $10 back at the end,' " said David Tepper, a money manager in San Francisco. "I'm being facetious -- but not by much."
To rescue American Adjustable investors, Piper has even sacrificed its own paycheck. For the 1995 trust, the company has waived its management fee from last September through fund termination next April. And on Tuesday, Piper proposed buying back up to 25 percent of the shares of the four other Adjustable trusts this fall -- at the net asset value, not the now-lower market price. The unprecedented plan, which would slash Piper's asset-based fees, is sure to receive investor approval.
"It's very uncommon," said Edward Kohler, president of Piper. "But the last three or four months have been very disappointing." So disappointing that despite the 1995 trust's fee waiver and slashed dividend, Piper will probably not be able to pay $10 a share, he said. The company is aiming for something over $9.50.
In short, the news may be so bad that it's good. "I'm sorry for people who bought at $10 and now face $7," Mr. Herzfeld said. "But now the vultures can pick up the remains."
Hefty discounts are the best reason to buy. "There are 20 variables to look at with closed funds, " Mr. Herzfeld said. "Numbers 1 through 10 are the discount." Piper's buybacks and fee waiver -- "that's more than half a percentage point a year" -- just add to the pot.
So does the prospect that the chastened funds "will now be run defensively," he said. Mr. Tepper, who is buying Franklin Principal Maturity, which traded at $8 on Thursday, agrees. Fear of lawsuits and the flap over sales tactics mean managers "will try hard to pay out $10."
Mr. Herzfeld favors trusts with discounts bigger than both their recent average and the average for similar funds. American Adjustable-1998, for example, is a Herzfeld buy. Its current 7.3 percent discount is ahead of its 5 to 6 percent average discount this year and of the 2.84 percent average discount for taxable term trusts.
Trusts with "lots of arms" -- adjustable-rate mortgages -- are appealing because "you can track interest rates back up with them," Mr. Madlem said. Jeffrey Griffin, a Piper senior vice president, calculates that as these mortgages "reset," the 5.3 percent average coupon of the many "arms" in the Adjustable series will rise to 7.2 percent within a year.
Bad news tars all, so investors should also seek out trusts wrongly tainted. For example, many term trusts that will soon end are trading at discounts similar to those of trusts with several years left, Mr. Madlem said. Thus, "the shorter-term ones may be undervalued," he said. If rates rise, they may also be safer.
Investors worried about the final payout may prefer trusts with many zero-coupon bonds, said Mr. Tepper, the money manager. And diversification, always wise, makes even greater sense with complex derivatives.
Many people resist all this positive thinking. You can get bargains at a fire sale, they say, but you can also get burned by these complex trusts.
"I never understood the attraction of term trusts," said Michael Stout of Morningstar. "If I'm an income investor, why would I buy something that assures a declining dividend?" he asked, alluding to the trusts' need to rely on safer maturities to conserve principal as liquidation nears. "And if I'm a growth investor, why would I invest $10 just to hope to get $10 back at the end?"
And the trusts' derivatives cast doubt on the strongest reason to buy them -- discounts. Derivatives are hard to price and often illiquid, making it tough to determine some trusts' net asset values. If the values are "not credible," Mr. Tepper said, the discounts may not be either.

The Worship Of False Sports Gods

BYLINE: By IRA BERKOW 

 BODY:
I WAS struck with a statement in a column in another newspaper the other day about O. J. Simpson, which said that "it had taken courage for him to run against men who were twice his size."
The writer went on to say that "it took no courage at all to murder the mother of two children and her companion, if in fact he was the one who did it. And it took no courage to repeatedly beat and terrorize the same woman, which we know for a certainty that he did." 
 It took no courage, however, for him to play football games, other than those required in summoning up his particular skills in that game, which is nothing more than a game, regardless of how society has often painted such games.
O. J. Simpson was blessed with immense athletic skills. He was strong, he was fast, he was shifty. He was one of the most talented running backs ever, combining the swivel hips of a Gale Sayers with the torpedo-like thrusts of Jim Brown. Simpson, in full football armor, also had blockers blocking for him. When he was with the Buffalo Bills, Simpson called his offensive linemen "the Electric Company," because "they turn the Juice loose."
But it is not uncommon to equate athletic talent with courage. It is done all the time by those in the game to perpetuate their economic base or aggrandize themselves, by the fans as a form of hero worship, and by the press, wittingly or not. Even one of the best sportswriters ever, Red Smith, once looked back and said he, too, at times, had been guilty of "godding up the players."
Sometimes we are so entranced with skill that we ascribe larger elements to those fortunate enough to have been born with them. We seek to make icons of them. "Like a young god, Hercules -- something like that," said Willy Loman, about his son, Biff, a high school football player, in "Death of a Salesman." "And the sun, the sun all around him. Remember how he waved to me? . . . and the cheers, when they came out -- Loman! Loman! Loman! God Almighty. . . . A star like that, magnificent, can never really fade away." But Biff did, disastrously.
When Charles Barkley appeared in a television commercial and said that he didn't want to be looked upon as a role model, for people really didn't know him, he received criticism from some quarters. How dare he! And yet all we know of Barkley, and all we knew of Simpson, is that they were sports stars.
But what and who are sports heroes? Was Mickey Mantle, who hit home runs but didn't look after himself or his family, a hero? Was Lawrence Taylor, who said he lusted to slam rivals so hard that their snot flew?
David Cone once told me that what he did wasn't courageous but a father or mother who gets up every morning to go to work to put food on the table for his family is courageous.
People who risk their lives in battle are courageous. During World War II, players like Hank Greenberg and Bob Feller enlisted in the military, and some, like the little-known Red Sox pitcher Earl (Lefty) Johnson, were awarded a Bronze Star for bravery in European action.
People who risk their lives on a ball field are courageous, as was Jackie Robinson, who braved death threats from those who were against his breaking the color barrier in the majors. Or Pee Wee Reese, who befriended him.
People who overcome great handicaps, who refuse to allow the world to tell them something is impossible, are courageous, like Jim Abbott, the one-handed pitcher of the Yankees.
Courage can come in the little moments, such as the time Jesse Barfield saw a female reporter maligned in the clubhouse and, risking a kind of ostracism, befriended her in a casual but powerful manner.
Mainly, we must look to qualities beyond the playing field. And athletes can be as worthy of respect here as anyone else. Like Roberto Clemente flying off on a mercy mission to bring food and clothing to people in Central America who had suffered an earthquake. Or Dave Bing, who has developed a business and has hired numerous minority-group workers, far exceeding any accomplishment he produced in his Hall of Fame basketball career.
If O. J. Simpson were to be admired for a special characteristic, it might have been his rise from ghetto gang leader to a heretofore contributing member of society.
"I remember that at first I hated O. J.," his first wife, Marquerite, told me in 1968, when they were first married and he was at U.S.C. "He was a tough, always wanting to fight. Once I was at a party, and he and his friends were not allowed in. So they broke windows and came in. It broke up a nice party."
But he changed. Or so we imagined.

HEADLINE: Finally, Talks With North Korea

 BODY:
President Clinton's announcement on Wednesday came as a relief: North Korea had persuaded him that it was suspending its nuclear program for now. Consequently, the U.S. would resume high-level talks with the North on July 8. Mr. Clinton paid tribute to Jimmy Carter's mission to Pyongyang: "It is the beginning of a new stage in our efforts to pursue a non-nuclear Korean Peninsula."
Now that nuclear diplomacy with North Korea is finally getting back to the negotiating table where it belongs, Mr. Clinton has to keep it there. He can accomplish that by cutting through the bickering in his own Administration and putting his personal stamp on a sound U.S. negotiating strategy. 
 To do that he has to be clear in his own mind about the basic objectives: first, to make the suspension permanent by dismantling the North's nuclear program; second, to learn as much as he can about North Korea's past efforts to divert plutonium; third, to curb North Korea's missile exports.
The President's immediate task, however, is to design a convincing package of inducements. The package would provide new nuclear reactors to replace the ones the North now has. It would promise full diplomatic recognition as well as a peace treaty formally ending the Korean War. And it would detail some of the economic benefits to flow from a new relationship.
The North's commitment to allow inspectors to monitor its nuclear reactor and reprocessing plant will insure, at least for now, that additional plutonium -- enough to build five bombs -- will not be extracted from the spent fuel rods now stored in cooling tanks at Yongbyon. But these fuel rods must be disposed of soon. That is an urgent task for the talks.
The North has also agreed not to reload its reactor for now, keeping it from generating more spent fuel that could be turned into plutonium for bombs. The task for the talks is to get North Korea to agree not to reload ever again, and to get an effective ban on reprocessing. That ban could be worked out in talks between the two Koreas. So it is good news that President Kim Il Sung is arranging to meet South Korea's President.
Perhaps the trickiest task facing American negotiators is finding out how far along Pyongyang's nuclear program actually is. The North has not yet allowed international inspectors to determine whether it extracted a bomb's worth of plutonium in 1989, but it has indicated it would accept special inspections to get at the past as part of an overall settlement.
The Carter mission was a big plus for both sides. The very presence of a former President of the United States reassured Mr. Kim that Washington was sincere about improving relations.
Mr. Carter helped Mr. Clinton regain his footing. Now the President needs to put together a persuasive diplomatic package to coax North Korea to become truly nuclear-free.

HEADLINE: Japan Should Pay for Its Own Defense

 BODY:
To the Editor:
A misleading impression is given that the United States holds a weak hand in negotiating with Japan in "A Giant Restrained" (Business Day, June 8). Japan is totally dependent on the United States for its external security. Moreover, Japan relies heavily on exports to United States markets, while the United States would benefit from fewer imports and more exports to Japan.
At the end of the Second World War the United States mandated that Japan devote its energies to peaceful development. To facilitate this policy, the United States opened its markets to Japan without requiring free access to Japanese markets. Moreover, the United States took care of Japan's external defense at the expense of United States taxpayers. 
 These policies have treated Japan like the 51st state of the Union without requiring it to abide by the rules applicable to the other states. What should have been a temporary arrangement after the war's devastation became institutionalized into history's biggest foreign aid program, enriching Japan at an annual rate estimated at $100 billion to $150 billion at United States expense.
During the period 1981-92 the United States spent $3 trillion on defense, or $12,000 per capita. In the same period, Japan spent less than $2,000 per capita. The $10,000 per capita difference gave the 120 million Japanese a $1.2 trillion advantage.
They used this free financing to build up their economy and to penetrate international markets previously served by United States companies. A substantial part of the $3 trillion Federal debt accumulated during the Reagan-Bush era and about $500 billion in United States trade deficits with Japan were caused by these policies.
The best interests of both countries would be served by establishing a mature partnership, one that involves equality in status and cost sharing in trade and defense. The Japanese should open their markets to United States goods and services on the same basis on which they are allowed access to United States markets. And the Japanese should also compensate the United States for defense services.

HEADLINE: A Thinking Person's Guide to University Grades

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Many of those both inside and outside of America's premier universities complain almost Calvinistically about the supposedly undeserved grades that are awarded to today's top students -- as, for example, in your letters columns of June 18 ("Graduate Students Give Grades a Boost") and June 12 ("Students Care Far Too Much About Grades"), all in response to "Making the Grades" (editorial, June 5).
But these complaints often overlook two important points.
First, it is wrongheaded to castigate students for relying, as all of us do every day, on settled expectations. Students at a given university get a sense of what sort of grades they ought to expect, and there is a certain haughty arbitrariness in suddenly stopping on a dime to inform the B student that he or she is "really" only a C student. 
 This solution is almost as unfair as protesting inflation by suddenly deciding to pay one's employees in wages that are pegged to the value the dollar held in 1950. Should I soon expect to pick up The New York Times for a nickel?
The second problem is that grades are subjective social constructs, not objective standards metaphysically woven into the fabric of the universe.
What, after all, does the grade of C indicate? Those who think today's grades are too high would argue that it should be taken to mean "average," while those less upset by grade inflation take it to mean "mediocre."
This choice obviously has important ramifications. Suppose every single one of your students is basically topnotch, as often holds in advanced undergraduate courses or graduate seminars. In this case excellence is average.
So do they all get A's or C's? The choice seems arbitrary to me, so opting to give them all C's has less to do with academic integrity than with a sort of neurotic stinginess.
This last year I served as a graduate preceptor for two courses that were offered by the department of politics at Princeton University, one of them on the history of political philosophy and the other on American constitutional interpretation. I had 45 students all told, approximately 1 percent of Princeton's undergraduate population.
Most of them were good writers, a few were bad, and a few were fantastic. So perhaps I should have given all of the "good" papers a C for "average." But wait! Doesn't "good" translate into a B, according to the classic grading rubric?
You see the problem, I hope. The average student at a university like Princeton or Stanford is good, so it is very easy for graders like me to settle on a B mean, especially where C is widely taken to mean not "average" but "mediocre." The B mean provides for few C's, but still allows ample room for the recognition of different levels of achievement.
For example, in my sections most of the students got B's and a few got B+'s. A grade of A- was very hard to get, and A's were rare indeed. Real problems of meaningless praise only ensue if professors start refusing to give anything less than an A- even in large classes where there are substantial differences in the quality of student writing, as does happen from time to time.
I think that the general recourse to a broad B mean is accurate and fair at a place like Princeton.
Of course, if this system still seems too lax, I suppose we could argue for a recalibration within each elite university, so that all of the country's best students -- who are obviously "average" compared with one another -- get C's. But I suspect that Western civilization will survive if we accept the B mean that I recommend and, having done so, turn away from this fetish and worry about grander things.

HEADLINE: ART;
Doesn't Anybody Want This Job?

BYLINE: By PAUL GOLDBERGER 

 BODY:
WANTED: CHARMING, erudite executive with the diplomatic skills of a foreign service officer, the financial skills of an investment banker and the social skills of a 1950's wife. Position requires the academic background of a serious scholar, with the willingness to let most of this knowledge go unused in favor of poring over budgets and staffing issues. Long hours, low pay and the chance to see your name in the papers every time you make even the slightest wrong move.
The job, of course, is running an art museum. Right now 13 museums in the United States are looking for directors, including three of the most prestigious: the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. Running any of them would seem like a dream job. But as art museums have evolved into huge institutions playing host to millions, the job has become more a matter of politics than of art. Who runs art museums may seem like a matter of little concern to art lovers. But it gets to the very heart of the question of what museums should be. And like so many other nonprofit cultural institutions, museums are struggling over the question of whether they should turn their fate over to professional managers or keep it in the hands of the specialists who have been in charge until now. 
 For all the aura of power that surrounds the running of a major museum, the day-to-day reality can be a matter of contentious staffs, financial pressures, public scrutiny that comes with the public funds most museums say they need to survive, and trustees who are often reluctant to let the director have a free hand in management. The one thing many directors say they have no time to think about is art.
"Directors are like classy beggars with golden cups," said Robert Buck, director of the Brooklyn Museum, who says he spends "150 percent" of his time raising money. "The whole game of keeping these institutions alive has become high stakes."
And once directors have mastered the juggling act of keeping trustees, donors, curators, the public and the press happy, they seem less inclined now to push their luck and try it all over again somewhere else. One of the Modern's brightest prospects, Peter Marzio, director of the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston, decided last month that he did not want to be considered for the post; the Modern had been told the same thing some months earlier by James Wood, the director of the Art Institute of Chicago. Richard E. Oldenburg, who had planned to retire as the Mod ern's director this month, has agreed to extend his tenure to the end of the year, and the board is gamely continuing its search.
While it's hardly the case that no one wants to run an art museum -- hundreds of them are run successfully by people who enjoy their jobs -- there is no question that over the last two decades, running the larger institutions has become less a matter of supervising artistic matters than of managing diverse and competing constituencies.
"You could argue that Wall Street is a more meritocratic place today than most nonprofit institutions," said Malcolm McKay, a partner in the executive search firm of Russell Reynolds Associates who specializes in finding heads for nonprofit organizations. With large, diverse boards, Mr. McKay said, the search process encourages bureaucrats and compromisers. "Intelligence and knowledge are less important than character and personality."
 
The Transformation
Populist Museums, Newly Rich Trustees
 A museum director's job is different today because museums themselves are different. They are as popular as they are scholarly, and they cut a far wider swath across society than they did a generation ago.
Then, museums tended to be run by art historians, curators who had risen from the ranks, and trustees were likely to limit their role to providing philanthropic support. Museums saw their constituencies as committed art lovers who trod calm and placid galleries: connoisseurship, not popular appeal, was the ideal.
All that changed dramatically in the 1970's, as museums began to see their mission as attracting a wider public. Blockbuster exhibitions, often sponsored by corporations eager to burnish their reputations by connecting their names to art, brought in masses of tourists and others who rarely, if ever, had visited museums before, and public support arrived in the form of state arts council and National Endowment for the Arts grants.
But this new money came with strings attached: both corporations and the government put pressure on museums to direct their programming to a broad sampling of society. Art became marketing, and museums talked in terms of box office.
Many became caught up in a frenzy of growth that had something other than the democratization of art as its goal. Building museums became a badge of success for cities, and for people who had grown rich in the 1980's. New blood, often newly rich blood, joined old museum boards. Museums got bigger and more expensive to maintain, which in turn required them to find ways of keeping attendance high to pay mounting bills. Many seemed victims of their own success, caught in a spiral of expanding audiences, expanded facilities and the need for ever more money to support them.
 
The Predicament
Musical Chairs In Reverse
 Few were prepared for the effects of these changes on the nature of the museum -- or for the predicament that many museums face now, when the lavish flow of private and corporate dollars has dried up and government support has been cut back sharply. Museums are left with huge overhead, high social expectations and less money.
"Trustees who made a lot of money fast tend to see the museum as just a business, and see its problems as just a turnaround situation," said J. Carter Brown, the former director of the National Gallery of Art in Washington. "But a museum is a delicate ecology. It needs to serve intellectual and esthetic goals, and it can't be put to the paradigm of another field. When you get a roomful of trustees who are used to getting their way by pounding the table in their own board rooms, it gets very difficult."
These new trustees have become notoriously fickle. Five of the present vacancies for museum directors are the result of directors' having been asked to resign by their boards, as was the vacancy that existed until recently at the Dallas Museum of Art. Michael Shapiro, the last director of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, lasted a mere 10 months; the same board that hired him in 1992 fired him in 1993 after deciding that the museum's serious financial and personnel troubles needed an administrator, not a curator, at the helm.
Michael Mezzatesta did not even get Mr. Shapiro's brief chance. The board of the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore hired him as its director last year, then changed its mind before he had even started. Mr. Mezzatesta, who was given a financial settlement and went back to his old job running the museum at Duke University, was said to have differed with the board over what the Walters should become. But why such a major conflict did not emerge during interviews has not been explained.
Many museums have turned the process of finding a director over to executive search firms like Mr. McKay's, which can make the search resemble the corporate world all the more. But museum directors have never been paid like the corporate executives they are being asked to act like. Most directors of major museums are paid between $150,000 and $200,000 a year, small potatoes by corporate standards. (One exception is Edmund P. Pillsbury, director of the private Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, whose $448,997 salary is paid by the Kimbell Art Foundation, which runs the museum.)
"For $200,000 a year, you get a fourth-rate administrator who could do better at General Electric," said Richard L. Feigen, the New York art dealer. "But that's what the job description calls for, administration and fund raising, since in most museums the trustees want to hold onto all the real power."
One of the few new-style directors who has managed to hold onto significant power himself, even with a strong board, is Thomas Krens of the Guggenheim Museum. But the entrepreneurial, deal-oriented Mr. Krens did it by leading his board into a whole new kind of museum management: aggressive expansion financed by aggressive borrowing. The Guggenheim borrowed so heavily that it even took the unusual step of allowing its art collection to be used as collateral against its loans.
The art hasn't been given up to the banks, but the results of the Guggenheim's leveraged expansion aren't encouraging. The museum had to lay off staff members this spring, and attendance at its new SoHo branch has been too low to cover expenses. No one knows yet whether the trustees are inclined to treat the expansion as just another business deal in need of fixing. But the board is made up heavily of rich entrepreneurs, not old-line philanthropists, and they tend to view the museum differently from the arts patrons of another era.
According to Ricky Abzug, associate director of the Program on Nonprofit Institutions at Yale University, who has tracked the evolution of the boards of museums in six major cities, more than half the trustees were listed in the Social Register in 1931. By 1961 this number had declined to 30 percent, and by 1991 it was under 10 percent.
 
The Candidates
'You Expect The Museum Messiah'
 The shift in the museum's identity over the last couple of generations, from private, cloistered institution to aggressively public one, has only begun to yield a generation of leaders equipped to handle the demands of the new institution. There are young directors who have garnered high marks in both management and curatorship, like Maxwell Anderson of the Michael C. Carlos Museum in Atlanta, who has been mentioned for both the Modern and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, and Charles Moffett of the Phillips Collection in Washington.
But the progression from small to medium-size to major is no longer something talented directors are certain they want. It isn't merely fear of the political and economic stresses that directing a major museum can bring; it is also a matter of the rising profile of many regional museums, which means that directors who have achieved success elsewhere no longer feel that they need the prestige of an institution like the Modern as a capstone to their careers.
Women are becoming more conspicuous in the once largely male preserve of museum directorships. (The Philadelphia Museum of Art, headed by Anne d'Harnoncourt, who has also been mentioned as a possibility for the Modern, and the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond, headed by Katharine Lee, are the largest museums run by women.) University museums, a kind of training ground, have historically been encouraging to women, and they continue to provide opportunities for curators to move up.
The J. Paul Getty Trust, which controls a major museum, the Getty in Los Angeles, has tried to step into the training void with a program in museum administration. While that program has earned high marks for its efforts to combine curatorial values with management training, it is too early to measure its results. But even if the program succeeds, the question remains whether a large museum can actually be run by one person. Three major institutions, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the Art Institute of Chicago, have decided that it cannot, and have been operating for years with dual leadership: a director who oversees matters related to the collections and exhibitions, and a president who handles administration and finance.
 
The Modern's Search
Switching Gears And Coming Up Dry
 The Museum of Modern Art flirted with that idea when it began its search for a new director last year and started looking for a paid president to take over many administrative and fund-raising duties and work alongside Mr. Oldenburg. When Mr. Oldenburg decided to step down, the board abruptly switched gears and started interviewing only people who were now running other museums -- a limited search that may be broadened again, sources close to the board say, because the museum has so far come up dry in its march through the roster of directors of other museums.
The Modern's search has been all the more frustrating because its unusual length has heightened expectations. "You expect the museum Messiah by now, and I'm not sure anyone can live up to that," said one person close to the museum. Making things worse, such a long period with a lame-duck director takes a toll on day-to-day operations and makes long-range planning nearly impossible. Several important posts are vacant and the museum has not rushed to fill them.
The Modern has always moved with a certain hesitation, of course. It stood largely aside from the attempts to redefine and expand that altered many institutions in the 1980's, and it has suffered neither the extreme financial pressures of the Guggenheim nor the virulent press attacks directed at the Whitney Museum and its two most recent directors, David Ross and Tom Armstrong.
The Modern's board is headed by Agnes Gund, an enthusiastic collector whose belief in contemporary art has pushed the museum, in mood at least, away from the somewhat dry, corporate tone it occasionally took on in the last generation. If the board has traditionally been somewhat torn between the museum's role as a historic institution and its commitment to the new, Ms. Gund's passions for new art have been a refreshing change.
But they have not brought the museum as an institution any closer to a sense of who should be leading it.
 
The Prognosis
The Secret Is to Delegate
 In the end, the key issue is one of curatorial values versus management. Everyone connected with a museum wants it to be headed by a trained art historian, just as universities believe they should be headed by scholars, newspapers expect to be run by journalists and hospitals want to be headed by doctors. But increasingly the director's curatorial credentials are little more than a symbol, a way of reminding the world that the museum is an art institution and not a corporation.
"Boards are criticized if they choose someone without a strong art history background," said Mr. McKay, "but the curatorial pool is not strong for people wanting to manage. It attracts people who love objects."
Most directors who have tried to devote significant portions of their time to organizing exhibitions have found that they can do so only at the cost of performing their management duties well. At least one recent candidacy for the directorship of a major museum foundered on the person's insistence that he be permitted to devote a substantial amount of time to mounting exhibitions. The board said no.
Is it just as difficult for a museum director to spend significant time with works of art as it is for, say, the president of a large university to teach? Probably so, and it isn't an entirely new problem. Alfred Barr, the legendary first director of the Museum of Modern Art, was removed by the trustees in 1943 largely because they thought he had neglected management in favor of curatorial work.
Yet as one trustee of the Modern said: "The secret of a good leader is delegating authority. What is most important is that the director be a cultivated person -- a person who speaks with great authority about the 20th century and its culture."

HEADLINE: The Hudson Waterfront: What's Next?

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
RIBBONS will not be cut for the grandest projects until early in the next century -- if then -- but plans for Manhattan's Hudson River waterfront are advancing on several fronts this summer, with tangible results promised next year.
Federal and state highway officials are nearing a final choice of design for the reconstruction of Route 9A from Battery Place to 59th Street. They are likely to heed the preference of transportation engineers for a $380 million "urban boulevard" with six to eight lanes of traffic, a 19-foot-wide median and a parallel bikeway and walkway. The decision could come next month. 
 July may also see a groundbreaking for the rebuilding of the Chelsea Piers, between 18th and 22d Streets, as a combination sports complex and movie and television studio. Roland W. Betts, one of the developers, said the project would be complete by the end of 1995.
Also in July, design will begin on a waterfront park from Battery Park City to 59th Street. It will be built by the Hudson River Park Conservancy, a subsidiary of the New York State Urban Development Corporation, whose board voted Tuesday to approve Quennell Rothschild Associates/Signe Nielsen as the landscape architects.
They were chosen by the conservancy in April and are already working on what one of the architects, Peter Rothschild, calls "modest, tentative improvements" for a few spots along the river, including a canoe and kayak launch on Pier 26, just north of Battery Park City. These temporary projects may be ready next spring.
Officials have also accelerated their assessment of a plan to move the West Side heliport from 30th Street to a surplus Navy helicopter carrier, the Guadalcanal, which would be anchored along the end of the Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum on Pier 86, at 46th Street.
"Things are beginning to happen," said Tom Fox, president of the conservancy. As well they might, since the Westway project along the same route was scuttled in 1985. Mr. Fox thinks the result was worth the wait.
"We will have a boulevard instead of a highway and a world-class park," he said. "For nine years of debate and discussion, that's not a bad result. I think it's a triumph of community participation."
But this summer's mileposts are regarded warily by critics who believe that the highway will provide infrastructure to spur intense development along the Hudson River and that "park" is a misnomer for what is more like a string of waterfront commercial projects.
"They keep referring to everything as park," said Assemblywoman Deborah J. Glick, Democrat of Manhattan, "but what's being offered are vest pockets in the midst of fairly intense commercial development."
On Pier 76, opposite the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, Mr. Fox envisions a terminal for the ferries operated by Arthur E. Imperatore, which now dock at Pier 78; restaurants, meeting rooms and a three-acre park.
Deputy Mayor Fran Reiter, who oversees land-use issues for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, said City Hall supported the general idea for Pier 76. "It's subject to a lot of negotiation," she said, "but in theory we like it."
Mr. Fox said the tow pound that is now on the pier could be removed to a block bounded by 11th and 12th Avenues, 33d and 34th Streets. That block might also be used for an addition to the convention center. A parcel on the 11th Avenue side would be made available to a development team headed by Julien J. Studley Inc., which was designated in 1987 to build a 1,560-room hotel on Pier 76, called Hudson River Center.
An inherent tension in the Hudson River Park project, as conceived by state officials, is the need for revenue-generating sources along the waterfront to finance the park itself. This is illustrated by the Pier 76 proposal, in which only half the area would be set aside as public open space.
"The purist in me says, 'Take it all and we'd have six more acres for the park,' " said Mr. Fox, who was once executive director of the Neighborhood Open Space Coalition. "But the realist in me says that we have to find an income generator that complements the park and allows us to maintain this pier."
THE search for new uses on old piers includes the Passenger Ship Terminal, Piers 88 through 92, from 48th to 52d Street. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey may quit the terminal when its lease expires at the end of the year.
The authority and the city's Economic Development Corporation began a search last year for proposals to exploit the terminal's unused capacity. Chris O. Ward, a senior vice president of the city development agency, said responses included amusement, recreation and entertainment ventures, as well as "modest commercial development."
Now, the economic development agency hopes to find an operator for the cruise-ship terminal, as well as a developer, so that the city would not lose money should it have to take over the complex, Mr. Ward said.
For its sheer size, as well as its prominence on the West Village waterfront, Pier 40 may be the biggest challenge and the site of the most pitched battles.
Not some slender finger in the water, Pier 40 has a surface area of about 14 acres -- roughly the size of Carl Schurz Park on the Upper East Side. The 32-year-old pier shed, originally a passenger and freight terminal for the Holland-America Line, has more than 1 million square feet of floor area
A neighborhood alliance called the Federation to Preserve the Greenwich Village Waterfront and Great Port believes the pier should be a Community Green, designed "by the people who will use it."
This proposal is supported by Community Board 2, said its chairwoman, Carol Feinman, which favors demolition of the existing shed to clear areas for sitting, bicycling, ball playing and Frisbee tossing.
But Mr. Fox said it would cost at least $75 million to raze the structure and build a park. Instead, as one alternative, he sees the three-level shed being used as studios for glassblowers, carvers, weavers, sculptors and other artisans. There would be a gift shop and restaurants, ball courts in the six-acre courtyard at the center of the building and a promenade on the eight-acre rooftop.
The cumulative result of such proposals, Assemblywoman Glick said, is that "there is very little area that the average person would recognize as open space or park."
"It's not a hidden agenda," she said. "To hear Tom Fox talk about the possibilities for commercial or retail development -- it's on the surface. The only artifice is that he keeps saying it's a park. Presumably, if you say it enough, people will believe it's a reality."
Critics say that if the plans were scaled back, the park could be built sooner and would be easier to finance.
"We'd rather have something simple we could enjoy now than a beautifully designed thing after we're dead," said Marcy Benstock, executive director of the New York City Clean Air Campaign. "The funds are available right now. Not all of it, maybe, but enough to do wonderful things."
Money is at the heart of the key unresolved issue: who will own and control the Hudson River waterfront -- that is, the area west of Route 9A, stretching from land's edge over water to the pierhead line, that was to have been the Westway right-of-way?
The property between Harrison and 35th Streets belongs to New York State. (The rest is owned by the city.) It was acquired with $81 million in Federal assistance, as Westway was to have been part of the interstate system. Now that it is not, local officials must either pay back the Government or obtain a waiver by persuading the Federal Highway Administration that the new uses would be related to transportation.
While the Government regards transportation enhancements broadly enough to include a bicycle path, pedestrian walkway and open space for scenic purposes, it would not allow elements like ball fields, marine facilities, food carts or benches.
Several Democratic legislators from Manhattan, including State Senator Franz S. Leichter and Assemblyman Richard N. Gottfried, have been pushing to designate the property as parkland. But they acknowledged that there were too many unresolved issues to expect parkland legislation in the current legislative session.
Instead, Mr. Gottfried said: "What's now on the table is to prohibit any residential, commercial office space or hotel development along the water. That would be an enormous step forward."
IF that happened, Mr. Fox said, "we should repay the Federal Government and get them out, because the state legislative protections are more onerous than a waiver." But Ms. Benstock charged that a payback would merely "clear the way for a complete takeover of the right-of-way by the Urban Development Corporation."
Deputy Mayor Reiter said the Giuliani administration supported the idea of a payback if the $40 million share owed by New York City came back in the form of $40 million in Federal transportation aid.
"We would like to see it mapped as parkland if the legislation handles it properly," Ms. Reiter said. "We have to have some limited but appropriate economic development and allow for the siting of a small amount of potential municipal facilities. The notion of it all being a park is something we're all agreed will never happen."
While these issues are thrashed out, the team charged with designing the waterfront park will begin its work. Besides Mr. Rothschild, Nicholas Quennell and Ms. Nielsen, the team includes the firms of Beyer Blinder Belle and Saccardi & Schiff.
Mr. Rothschild said it would take about two years to prepare an environmental impact statement and get approval on the final park design. The first step, he said, would be meeting with community boards, advocacy groups and neighborhood leaders to learn what they want in a park. "We are kind of agents, if you will, or ombudsmen of the public will," Mr. Rothschild said.
As a temporary measure to "get people down to the waterfront," Mr. Quennell said, several modest projects will be undertaken:
* Pier 26, near North Moore Street -- a canoe and kayak launch.
* Pier 45, at West 10th Street -- two 40-by-250-foot sunbathing areas, with grass or sand, raised 16 to 18 inches from the deck to provide bench-like seating.
* Pier 54, at 13th Street -- an outdoor museum of maritime artifacts salvaged from the waterfront, like bollards, chocks and cleats, framed by the remains of the Cunard Piers headhouse.
These temporary projects are not meant to presage the ultimate nature of the park, Mr. Quennell said, although they might provide some cues if they proved to popular.
Construction of the ultimate waterfront park would accompany that of Route 9A, which is to be built in 10 stages over the course of seven and a half years. As many as five stages may be under way at any time.
The Route 9A project reached a critical crossroads with the publication earlier this month of a final environmental impact statement that identifies the highway design preferred by transportation engineers.
They chose what is called an "enhanced basic reconstruction" of the existing roadway, the least expensive of four alternative construction possibilities. It seems virtually certain that this choice will be ratified by state and Federal officials.
"WE'VE worked very, very closely with the decision makers," said Robert J. Ronayne, executive director of the Route 9A project for the state Transportation Department. "I'd be very surprised if they didn't choose it."
Mr. Ronayne said the preferred highway had the qualified support of all but one of the four affected community boards.
"We've supported, from very early on, the enhanced basic reconstruction," said Ross Graham, chairwoman of Community Board 4, whose area runs from 14th to 59th Street. "Bob Ronayne seems to have a genuine commitment to doing a good road."
A key feature of Route 9A would be the straightening of a notorious S-curve at 23d Street. This would involve clipping a bit of Thomas F. Smith Park and acquiring a privately owned building at 621 West 23d Street. The plan also calls for the widening of 24th Street west of 11th Avenue, which would require the acquisition of the rest of the privately owned properties on that block.
Land acquired by the state but not used for roadways would be combined with the existing park across 23d Street, which would be closed btween Route 9A and 11th Avenue.
The creation of the Chelsea Waterside Park, as Ms. Graham called it, would eradicate one of the last vestiges of "Chelsea" itself, the country estate deeded in 1750 to Captain Thomas Clarke and renowed as the home of Clement Clarke Moore.
The four-story industrial building at 621 West 23d Street, which dates from the 1920's, is owned by a corporation headed by Richard W. Moore, a lawyer and great-great-great-great grandson of Clement Clarke Moore.
Mr. Moore declined to comment on the prospect of condemnation. But Mr. Ronayne, imagining the landmarks implications of any association with Mr. Moore's ancestor, said, "Luckily for us, he didn't write 'Night Before Christmas' in that building."

HEADLINE: The Evolution Of the SoHo District

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Here at the Landmarks Preservation Commission we all enjoyed your May 8 article on the evolution of SoHo. For those of us who remember SoHo in the 1960's and 1970's, its transformation has been truly remarkable. 
 But we also remember that it was the city's designation of the entire SoHo-Cast-Iron Historic District, from Crosby to West Broadway and Canal to Houston, that was instrumental in protecting the world's greatest concentration of cast-iron fronted buildings from demolition for the proposed Lower Manhattan Expressway. It was that battle for historic preservation, together with the campaign for legalized artists' working/living space, that kept SoHo from being leveled, and made possible whatever successes it has since sustained.
Today, the SoHo, TriBeca and Ladies' Mile historic districts have become breeders of the kind of economic development that this city needs so badly. The role of historic preservation in creating that development shouldn't be underestimated, or overlooked.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/The Hemmerdinger Approach;
Carrots, Not Sticks; Improvement, Not Growth

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
H. DALE HEMMERDINGER uses the carrot, not the stick. When too many executives at ATCO Properties, his real estate services company, were getting pudgy, he offered them $100 a pound to lose weight. When he read about the benefits of aerobics exercise, he began paying a $500 year-end bonus to any employee who climbed the 16 flights to ATCO's offices, $250 for anyone who walked halfway up. A smoker quits, it's worth $500.
One result of all this gentle bribery is that very few fat people work at ATCO's headquarters at 555 Fifth Avenue, at 46th Street. And Mr. Hemmerdinger has offered the one holdout smoker a mink coat to quit. 
 "Dale knows what drives people," said Peter L. DiCapua, ATCO's senior vice president, who has lost $5,400 worth of pounds.
Mr. Hemmerdinger, 49, apparently believes that much can be accomplished with a dollop of cash and a ton of psychology. And that includes making money in a tough real estate market.
The Hemmerdinger family owns five office buildings and two apartment buildings in New York and Mr. Hemmerdinger has crunched the numbers. Any way you cut it, he says, the taxes and operating costs in those buildings will be higher than the income they generate for a long, long time.
Mr. Hemmerdinger is certain that his plight is typical. So he is setting up a private hedge fund to sell real estate short. He and his partners will make most of their money if the real estate investment trusts -- known as REITs -- and other real estate-related stocks they pick lose value.
"All this recent misplaced optimism about a recovery stems from a lack of understanding about real estate as a market," Mr. Hemmerdinger said.
Craig A. Drill, a Manhattan hedge fund manager who will run the fund, is certain that jaundiced view has huge profit potential. "Unsophisticated buyers spend billions on REITs," he said. "Dale can spot which REITs will cut dividends and lose money."
Contrariness is nothing new for Mr. Hemmerdinger. He spent the last half of the 80's, when most other developers were building on every square inch of dirt, bailing out of real estate all over the country.
"We no longer felt that owning a hodgepodge of properties was the best way to get a good return on our money," he said.
Mr. Hemmerdinger sold more than a dozen properties. He used some of the proceeds to pay off the mortgages on the buildings he kept. The rest he invested in a bank that does not make real estate loans and in a portfolio of stocks unrelated to real estate.
In 1992 he formed Atlas Partners, a consulting firm to help banks, insurance companies and other "accidental owners" figure out what to do with their properties.
"Dale offers the vantage point of an owner, and at highly competitive fees," said Harrison J. Goldin, the former City Comptroller who hired Mr. Hemmerdinger to gauge the prospects of some properties involved in a bankruptcy in which Mr. Goldin is a trustee.
Mr. Hemmerdinger makes no apologies for switching from bricks and mortar to advice and passive investment.
"MY mother used to rail at me, say, 'Look what Donald Trump is doing -- why can't you grow our business like that?' " Mr. Hemmerdinger recalled. "Well, we entered the 1990's debt free and our investments have been profitable every year since."
Still, Mr. Hemmerdinger's current businesses mark a real departure from the Hemmerdinger family development legacy.
Back in 1922, Dale Hemmerdinger's grandfather, Henry, bought Atlas Terminals, a four-building industrial complex in Glenwood, Queens, to house his rag-recycling business. First, he leased out space he didn't use. Soon, he was building new buildings. Today there are 38 buildings in what has become a thriving industrial park.
The park did so well that Mr. Hemmerdinger's father, Monroe, who died in 1962, sold the recycling business and became a full-time developer. By the end of the 1950's he had built numerous industrial buildings in Miami and New York and two Manhattan office towers, 555 Fifth and 630 Third Avenue, at 41st Street.
"My grandfather viewed real estate as an investment," Mr. Hemmerdinger recalled. "My father made it the family business."
Dale Hemmerdinger almost sidestepped that business. He majored in fine arts at New York University, then entered a masters program in government. His plan was to join the Foreign Service.
Then, in 1967, a trustee of his father's estate invited him to lunch, told him the business was foundering and begged him to take over. He did, dismissed the five people working for it, changed its name from Hemmerdinger Estate Corporation to Hemmerdinger Corporation and formed ATCO (an acronym for Atlas Terminals Corporation) as the company's management and construction arm.
Early on he hired Mr. DiCapua, fresh out of the Merchant Marine and as young and inexperienced as Mr. Hemmerdinger. The second to be hired was Alan Rosenbluth, a lawyer who is now ATCO's head administrator. Neither man has equity in the company, but both can invest in Mr. Hemmerdinger's deals with no mark-ups or caveats.
"When they have their own money up, I know I'm getting their best opinion on whether to do a deal," Mr. Hemmerdinger said.
The team has made its share of mistakes. Take, for example, the luxury condominiums they built in Montauk, L.I.
"We put in all kinds of fancy fixtures," Mr. DiCapua said. "Our competitors recognized that customers were happy with $30 doors from the local home-improvement store." ATCO and its executives lost money.
Still, the ATCO connection has clearly been satisfying and lucrative for both Mr. DiCapua and Mr. Rosenbluth, in that both are still with the company.
"Dale is not detail-oriented, and that's a weakness," Mr. DiCapua said. "But he never second-guesses people he trusts."
That list includes few outsiders. ATCO does its own construction because Mr. Hemmerdinger feels that contractors cut too many corners on tenant build-out work. He employs his own leasing people, lest outsiders who don't have to face the owner each day push through unprofitable deals to get commissions.
And he ticks off whole categories of properties that he will never again buy or build because they are subject to outside forces:
Shopping centers are too dependent on anchor stores. One-family homes are too dependent on individuals. Mr. Hemmerdinger is even chary of office buildings where too many leases roll over at the same time.
"I ONCE lost a 350,000-square-foot tenant for reasons I couldn't control, and I don't want to be that dependent on one tenant ever again," said Mr. Hemmerdinger, who tries to write deals so that about 10 percent of the leases in his buildings roll over each year.
For now, except for a discount mall near London that he has bought into, no new real estate investment seems enticing. Instead, Mr. Hemmerdinger is concentrating on improving the buildings he already owns.
"Depreciation isn't just an accounting issue," he said. "Keeping buildings in shape is critical to keeping tenants."
He has been redoing lobbies, elevators and windows at all his office buildings. And he has refurbished 40 Central Park South, the family-owned rental building where he lives with his playwright wife, Elizabeth.
The rehabs, along with Mr. Hemmerdinger's habit of frequently lunching with tenants, have won ATCO tenant loyalty.
"Lighting, windows, a concierge desk -- they seem to always be improving something," said Stanley Blindman, a partner in the law firm Blindman, Uram & Swords, which just renewed its lease at 630 Third. "I could probably have struck a harder deal elsewhere, but the nonadversarial relationship with ATCO is worth a little extra rent."
Mr. Hemmerdinger is not quite as adamant about staying put as is his tenant. Whether he continues to devote his energy and his family's wealth to real estate will depend on whether his children -- Damon, 23, and Katherine, 20 -- join the business. And that, Mr. Hemmerdinger expects, will depend on whether New York City's economy and quality of life improves.
A self-described old-school Democrat, Mr. Hemmerdinger is nonetheless hoping that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani will accomplish what his Democratic predecessors could not.
"Business improvement districts and incentives to keep companies from moving aren't the answer," he said. "If we don't get low taxes and safe streets and better education, businesses will flee this town. And I wouldn't be surprised if my children do, as well."

HEADLINE: New Jersey Q & A: George R. Zoffinger;
Behind the Campaign for the World Cup

BYLINE: By TOM TOOLEN 

DATELINE: NEW BRUNSWICK

 BODY:
THOUGH George R. Zoffinger is still disturbed at the way the United States Postal Service slighted New Jersey by leaving the state's name off the official World Cup souvenir postal card, the anger has subsided somewhat because of the success of the first World Cup game, which was played last weekend at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford.
Mr. Zoffinger was one of the 74,000 fans who watched Ireland defeat Italy 1 to 0 in the first of seven World Cup games at the stadium. 
 "Seeing how well the game went and how much fun everyone had has taken some of the sting out of being slighted on the stamps," he said.
Mr. Zoffinger, 46, the co-chairman of the New Jersey World Cup Host Committee, tried a stop-the-stamp campaign before the postal cards carrying three different World Cup stamps was issued on May 26.
"It's just another example of how New Jersey gets discriminated against in the larger picture, and that is why it was so important to bring the World Cup games to Giant Stadium," he said. "We will make sure everyone knows the games are being played in New Jersey."
Many officials, including Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, sent letters asking that the souvenir cards be amended to include New Jersey's name, but postal officials said it was too late. Officials of the International World Cup Organization in New York apologized for the omission, and so did the postal officials.
Mr. Zoffinger is also chairman of the Corestates New Jersey National Bank, in New Brunswick. At his office, he said the World Cup was bringing millions of dollars into the state's coffers, with people from around the world visiting New Jersey.
Half a million people are expected to see the seven games at Giants Stadium, and millions more will be seeing the games across the nation. The games will last five weeks, with the finals in Los Angeles.
Q. Why is the World Cup so important to New Jersey?
A. The World Cup will attract more than $800 million of revenue into the metropolitan area, and half of that will be spent in New Jersey. In addition, over all, more than two billion people will watch the finals via satellite on TV around the world. It will go a long way in putting New Jersey on the map because the World Cup is a mega-event and most of the world is crazy about soccer.
Q. How did you get the campaign to get the World Cup started?
A. I was with Gov. Jim Florio in a Portuguese restaurant in the Ironbound section of Newark in 1990, and a giant roar came up from the other room. The Governor asked me what the noise was, and I told him it was a bunch of people watching the World Cup. That was my opening to ask the Governor if we could attempt to bring the World Cup to New Jersey.
He was very enthusiastic when he saw how excited the people were getting about the games. The Governor said that if that much emotion is involved, then New Jersey should give it a try and try to attract the World Cup in 1994. After all, New Jersey has deep ethnic ties to the sport, he said, and don't forget the New York Cosmos had played their games in Giants Stadium.
Q. You were never discouraged about bringing the games to New Jersey?
A. No, I guess I'm not that type of person. I know that if we work hard enough, good things will happen. There will be banana peels along the way, but you don't have to step on them.
Q. What was the biggest problem?
A. I guess the fact that we had to find a way to replace the artificial grass in the stadium with real grass. International soccer rules say that the World Cup games must be played on real grass. But there was no real problem since the folks at the New Jersey Meadowlands Sports and Exposition Authority found a way to lay the real grass over the artificial turf.
Q. Any other problems?
A. Well, many people were skeptical about us being able to pull it off. Who would have imagined when we first started that the teams with the two largest ethnic followings in the state -- Italy and Ireland -- would be playing on June 18? But they did.
Q. You're still fuming about the omission of New Jersey by the Postal Service?
A. Well, it was a mistake, an honest mistake, I understand that, but it's a mistake that happens too often to New Jersey. For instance, when the United States Open golf tournament was being played at Baltusrol, a great New Jersey golf course in Springfield, all the TV announcers were talking about was the New York skyline and showing the World Trade Center. They should have been talking about New Jersey and showing the Jersey Shore or some other state attractions.
Q. Do you think the World Cup will help change the image of New Jersey in the eyes of outsiders?
A. I think it will. It will show the world that we have a great stadium in East Rutherford, and we have great attractions in the state. It will be a boon for the state -- that's for sure.
Q. How did you win approval for the World Cup?
A. It began when I was head of the Department of Commerce and Economic Development for the state, an agency designed to create jobs and attract business to New Jersey. What greater attraction than the World Cup? I assigned a lawyer to assess potential sites and draw up a no-frills proposal. The lawyer took the $250,000 application fee that was required to apply for the World Cup out of the department's advertising budget. Incidentally, we eventually got the deposit back, and we got the World Cup games too.
Q. How did you convince the World Cup officials that New Jersey was the place to play seven games?
A. We convinced them that we would change over to grass with no problem and we would adhere to the wider field that soccer is played on. They were impressed with the fact that the largest soccer crowd in history had seen Pele play in Giants Stadium, a North American record that stood for nearly a decade.
Q. How many others were bidding to be host to the World Cup games?
A. We beat out 35 competitors to be one of the nine sites for the World Cup play. And we have the most games played here in New Jersey than the other sites: Washington, Dallas, Detroit, Chicago, San Francisco, Orlando, Austin and the finals in Los Angeles.
Q. What do you say to the New Jersey detractors now?
A. I say that the whole world found Lillehammer, Norway, for the Olympics, and I'm sure they have found East Rutherford, N.J., for the World Cup.
Q. What was the most rewarding part of seeing the first game?
A. Exhilaration, excitement and relief. I was exhilarated to see the fruits of our long months of labor. I was excited at the well-played soccer game. I was relieved there was a great feeling of fun among the spectators. There was virtually no trouble at all, and for that I was very relieved. I think that shows that New Jersey was the right choice to host the games.

HEADLINE: A SENSE OF PLACE

BYLINE: By Glenn Collins 

 BODY:
THEY are tough. They are resourceful. And they are everywhere: one of New Jersey's most abundant natural resources. Yet they get absolutely no respect.
Talk-show hosts make jokes about them; government authorities favor their elimination. Worse, they breed wild speculation and outright rumor. And so, at long last, some hard-hitting truths about the New Jersey mosquito. 
 Is the New Jersey mosquito the state bird?
Absolutely not. This silly, New Jersey-bashing deceit was first launched as a joke by Johnny Carson on the "Tonight" show in 1964 and has been perpetrated by Jay Leno and David Letterman. As readers of the scandal sheets must know by now, the state bird of New Jersey is the killer bee.
Should state residents be defensive about the notorious New Jersey mosquito?
Beware, citizens: mosquito guilt is an insidious condition. It has been fostered by the Anti-New Jersey Promotional Authority, a national hate group that has long placed New Jersey-mocking jokes in Hollywood movies and in the hands of stand-up comedians. Before its mosquito campaign, the authority kept busy spreading the rumor that Jimmy Hoffa is buried in the Garden State.
How are mosquitoes a positive asset for New Jersey?
Residents should be justifiably proud of that these legendary residents are actually a vital New Jersey resource.
1. They are responsible for maintaining the nationally recognized diversity of the bird population of the state.
2. They have been a spur to the pesticide refinery-plant industry that has for decades contributed so much to the ambiance of the New Jersey Turnpike.
3. Most importantly, the New Jersey mosquito has single-handedly deterred hordes of unmannerly out-of-staters from despoiling our favorite beaches, forest lands and hiking preserves. Home-grown mosquitoes have even been known to intimidate indomitable Mainers heading to the Jersey Shore to escape the stinging bites of black flies.
Can the bite of a New Jersey mosquito be fatal?
Unlike the aggressive urban mosquitoes of neighboring states, well-mannered New Jersey insects rarely engage in drive-by bitings or insect wilding, and for the most part they practice safe sting.
What attracts mosquitoes to their victims?
Scientists used to believe that mosquites were attracted to the carbon monoxide, warmth and moisture of the breathing mammal. But that was based on studies of unsophisticated out-of-state insects. New Jersey mosquitoes are much more selective; they prefer to dine on trendier New Jerseyans who have consumed Brie, sun-dried tomatoes, pignoli nuts, jicama slices and Zima alcoholic beverage.
Are New Jersey mosquitoes the largest in America?
No, although die-hard New Jersey boosters would certainly feel a surge of pride if the state ever held the record. But Alaska has larger mosquitoes by far. The record-holder was a 2.3-pound Anopheles captured with 10-pound monofilament line and a standard reel at Point Barrow on Sept. 29, 1982.
The largest New Jersey mosquito on record was a mere 1.3 pounds, captured in a swampy region of Wawayanda State Park the night of July 3, 1979.
The magnificent specimen was caught only because it was carrying a flashlight, and it has been placed on permanent exhibition in the legendary "Garden State Hall of the Mosquito" display next to the change machine near the snack-bar corner of the Molly Pitcher Service Area on the New Jersey Turnpike.
How many mosquitoes are there in New Jersey?
Happily, according to statistics released by the New Jersey Bureau of the Mosquito Census, the mosquito population has grown by leaps and bounds in the last decade. The current species are larger, healthier and stronger than ever before, thanks to the decades-long efforts of the New Jersey Mosquito Control Commission. The number has increased 5.1 percent, to 44,912,024,000 mosquitos productively living, working and contributing to the state's economy.
What is the position of New Jersey mosquitoes on the possible move of the New York Yankees to the Garden State?
The Mosquito Trades Council, Local 1020, has unanimously voted to support all attempts to bring more people, Yankees or otherwise, to the Meadowlands. Members especially wish to personally welcome George Steinbrenner.
What is the state's official stance toward the New Jersey mosquito?
A bill, S.L. 345Hi(A), nicknamed the "bloodsucker bill," would impose a graduated income tax upon all 44 billion working mosquitoes in the state. Mosquito-rights groups have vowed to protest the measure to the last bite.
How can the New Jersey mosquito best be repelled?
Although commercially available sprays may be effective, the most successful strategy is to just say no. In fact, a loud, firm "no," when aimed at a cruising Garden State mosquito, can be effective since New Jersey species are highly intelligent.
What is the future of the mosquito in New Jersey?
The Native Jerseyan Mosquito Coalition has instituted a lawsuit challenging mosquito-eradication efforts in the state. The suit argues that mosquitoes have inhabited New Jersey since shortly after the extinction of the dinosaurs. Therefore, the suit says, mosquitoes have the right of citizenship in the state. The suit would designate humans as legal prey.
Why do New Jersey mosquitoes hum?
The humming noise was long thought to be a powerful sexual attractant of the male mosquito for the female. But researchers have discovered the true reason that mosquitoes hum: they are really happy with their work.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
Riding the Roller Coaster in Europe

BYLINE: By Richard W. Stevenson 

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
IN the European bond markets, last week was a doozy, even by the tumultuous standards of the last several months.
It started with a bang on Monday. With the dollar plunging and inflation fears intensifying, investors dumped bonds as fast as they could into a market where buyers, to the extent that there were any, were growing increasingly reluctant at any price. Prices plunged. Yields soared. Traders began worrying about a major market meltdown. 
 As the week progressed, relative calm descended. The dollar stabilized against the German mark and the Japanese yen. Stock prices recovered somewhat. Bond yields edged down.
Then on Friday, the markets grew anxious again, sending stocks and bonds tumbling. Intervention by central banks on Friday to prop up the dollar soothed the worst of the anxieties in the markets but by no means put them to rest.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year German Government bond, the Bund, rose to 7.19 percent on Monday, up from 7.12 percent on the day and up from about 5.6 percent at the beginning of this year. It fell back to around 7 percent on Thursday, and then spiked upward again on Friday, closing at 7.05 percent.
Government bond yields in most other European nations have risen even more steeply since the beginning of the year. The benchmark Italian 10-year bond was yielding 9.438 percent at the close on Friday, up from 9.331 percent on Thursday.
Given the generally strong economic fundamentals in Europe -- and the prospect of further official interest rate cuts in Germany -- some investors and analysts began wondering whether the bear market in bonds was just about over, and whether there was not some value at current prices.
"We certainly take the view that the market is being far too pessimistic, particularly in continental Europe, about the likely path of economic growth and inflation," said Ros Lifton, an economist at Nomura Research.
Yet Ms. Lifton, like most analysts and economists, was far from ready to call a turn in the market. The fundamentals are strong, but the negative market psychology seems stronger, and investors in Europe appear likely to remain extremely sensitive to signs of incipient inflation and dollar weakness, and to take their cues from rising interest rates in the United States.
European bond prices have been falling since February, when the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates in the United States, puncturing the belief that rates would continue falling or remain at historical lows even as the world's economies picked up.
Hedge funds and other big institutional investors that loaded up on bonds during 1993 in a bet on falling rates found themselves selling frantically to minimize losses on their positions -- and each bout of selling pushed prices down further, creating even more selling pressure and driving away buyers.
Evidence of economic recovery in the United States and Europe has only served to further fuel inflation fears, even though inflation remains remarkably well tamed on both sides of the Atlantic.
The markets got a glimmer of good news last week. A key measure of the German money supply fell somewhat in May, the Bundesbank announced, raising hopes that the powerful German central bank might be able to reduce official interest rates again later this summer. The money supply figure, M3, rose at an annualized rate of 13.7 percent in May on a seasonally adjusted basis -- well above the Bundesbank's target of 4 percent to 6 percent, but below what the markets had expected and down from the 15.4 percent rise in April.
In a report to clients last week, Salomon Brothers in London said it expected further reductions in M3 growth and steady reductions in inflation.
"The substantial deceleration in M3 from the current pace will enable the Bundesbank to embark on another easing move without raising fears of future inflationary pressures," Salomon Brothers said. "Near term, bearish sentiment could push Bund yields up further. However, with M3 and inflation slowing, Bunds should prove an attractive buying opportunity later this year."
Part of the Bundesbank's monetary strategy in recent months has been to cut short-term interest rates in the hopes of encouraging savers to move money from savings accounts -- where it is included in M3 -- into long-term investments such as bonds. Brian V. Mullaney, an economist at Morgan Stanley in London, said that the role of domestic investors in the European bond markets would be crucial, but that in Germany, for example, domestic demand for bonds has not yet improved significantly.
"So far, local investor interest has been, and remains, insufficient to prevent further increases in bond yields, as increasingly risk-averse international investors scale back their exposure," Mr. Mullaney said in a report last week.
Mr. Mullaney said long-term bond yields are just now reaching their average over the last 20 years of 7.5 percent in Germany, and that real yields -- the difference between absolute yields and the level of inflation -- are still below their historical average of 4 percent to 4.5 percent.
"But although market valuations now look less expensive than before, they are still not cheap," Mr. Mullaney said. "So bond market performance still depends primarily on the outlook for short-term interest rates, which in turn depends on the outlook for inflation and economic recovery."
