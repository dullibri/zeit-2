HEADLINE: Bridge

BYLINE: By Alan Truscott

 BODY:
Seattle has some 7,000 hotel rooms, but it will be hard to find one around Thanksgiving. There will be at least 5,000 visitors bent on attending the football game between Washington and Washington State. There will be some 4,000 bridge players attending the Fall Nationals, with headquarters at the Sheraton Hotel. And there will be 3,000 delegates, staff members and journalists attending the Asia-Pacific Conference, an economic meeting of nations of the Pacific Rim.
There has already been some furor because one president, Barbara Nudelman of the American Contract Bridge League, has refused to surrender the presidential suite at the Sheraton to another President, Kim Young-sam of South Korea. 
 The Korean Consul in Seattle would not comment, but Mrs. Nudelman was forthright: "I can't believe this man has anything but an ego trip in needing this suite. Is he going to entertain every night? Who is he going to entertain? I entertain hundreds of people over 10 days."
The Sultan of Brunei, the world's richest man, was another unsucessful applicant for the suite, which covers 1,500 square feet and costs $2,000 a night. The Bridge League has it as part of a contract for space in the whole hotel.
 
High-Level Chinese Game
 A different, and more harmonious, relationship between an American official and Asian leaders will occur in January. Jim Cayne of Manhattan, president of the Bear, Stearns brokerage, will play bridge with members of the Chinese hierarchy when he goes to Beijing in January to open an office there. This repeats a similar visit to Shanghai last January, and again he will partner Kathie Wei-Sender, long a link between the Chinese Government and the United States.
In a recent practice match in Manhattan, preparing for their trip, Wei-Sender opened the North hand shown with two diamonds, a Precision bid showing a three-suiter short in diamonds. Over a double, showing diamonds, Cayne jumped to four hearts with the South hand. West might have saved in five diamonds, which would have failed by a trick, but chose to defend and lead the diamond jack.
South had to worry about the spade ace, the heart queen and the club king. He took the diamond ace and led a spade, testing the water in that suit. When West played low and the king won, South played another spade. This left all options open, and when East won and played a diamond dummy ruffed.
South was willing to lose a club trick, and East was likely to have the king. The queen was led from dummy, and East won and played another diamond. South ruffed in dummy and played trumps, surrendering a trick to the queen. He had made his game by avoiding the traps that defeated the declarer in the replay.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Harmonizing From a Forbes Quartet

BYLINE: By DEIRDRE CARMODY

 BODY:
The frenetic 1980's had been over for only two months when Malcolm S. Forbes, chief executive of Forbes Inc. and a flamboyant presence on the American business scene for almost 40 years, died unexpectedly in his sleep at the age of 70. It was, everyone said, the end of an era.
But it was also the start of an astonishingly compatible partnership, as his four sons assumed leading positions in the family publishing company that had been founded by their grandfather in 1917. 
 In 1992, under their leadership and during one of the worst economic periods in the history of magazines, Forbes magazine became the industry leader in ad pages. It was a feat their father had never accomplished. Since his death, the company has also brought out new magazines, started three foreign-language editions of Forbes, expanded its weekly newspaper chain in New Jersey and embarked on a custom textbook publishing venture. And it is about to open an executive conference center on the 255,000-acre Forbes Trinchera ranch in Colorado.
"I think a lot of people felt that when Malcolm passed away, the company was in trouble," said Frank Smith, vice president and group director of print services at the advertising agency Young & Rubicam. "The fact is that since Malcolm's passing, I think the company is stronger and the magazine is better."
Some things have not changed. The Forbes brothers have continued the extravagant business entertaining that was their father's trademark. On eight Saturdays in autumn, for instance, they invite groups of publishers, ad executives and others aboard the Highlander, their father's yacht, and take them up the Hudson River to West Point. The yacht is also used for dinners like one last Thursday, which included Margaret Thatcher and Ann Landers as guests.
The brothers continue to offer balloon meets at the family chateau in Normandy and paid trips to Europe for special advertisers. Last month, 10 advertising chief executives and their spouses were flown to Paris on the Concorde for two days of wining and dining and a private viewing of an exhibit of Faberge jewelry that included four Faberge Imperial eggs from the Forbes collection. Another group went to St. Petersburg, Russia, in June to see the same exhibit at the Hermitage Museum.
But more striking than the lavish entertaining style are the respect and affection that the brothers have for one another. They had known that when their father died, the eldest brother, Malcolm S. Forbes Jr., known as Steve, would inherit 51 percent of the voting stock and become president and chief executive. Steve Forbes, 46, is also editor in chief of Forbes magazine, chairman of the 17 Forbes newspapers and chairman of American Heritage magazine, which Forbes acquired in 1986.
Christopher Forbes, 42, who is known as Kip, is vice chairman of Forbes Inc., responsible for all advertising and promotion. He is also in charge of the German, Chinese and Japanese editions of Forbes and the company's real estate holdings in England, France and Morocco, as well the corporate art collection.
Robert L. Forbes, 44, is vice president of Forbes Inc. and president of Forbes FYI, a quarterly life style publication introduced in September 1990. And Timothy C. Forbes, 40, is president of the American Heritage division of Forbes, which includes five subsidiary magazines and a custom textbook publishing group.
 
'Genuinely Like Each Other'
 "I think the smartest thing Malcolm did was to raise four people who genuinely like each other," said Christopher T. Buckley, editor of FYI, and a friend of the family. "They tend to laugh with each other, and that's a pretty good sign. It's impossible to imagine a serious rift occurring in this family as has occurred in other American dynasties."
Why are the brothers so close?
In an interview, Kip Forbes grinned and said, "If you have all learned how to play the bagpipes together and wear kilts to church on Sunday, you have gone through the ultimate bonding experience."
Or, as Steve Forbes put it: "We trust each other totally. It's a nice relationship, one we would not have thought of when we were youngsters. We are not throwing balls at each other now, and we all have shares in the business so we all have a stake in doing well."
They also have a sister, Moira Mumma, 38, who shares in the inheritance. But she decided long ago not to become involved in the operations of the business, despite her father's urging.
Forbes is a privately held company and does not disclose its revenue or profit. Estimates about the worth of Mr. Forbes's estate at the time of his death ranged from about $400 million to $1 billion. Steve Forbes said that at the time of his father's death, the estate was worth "more than $100 million and less than $1 billion."
 
Gains in Circulation
 Sitting in his father's former office in the Forbes building on lower Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, Steve Forbes seemed to enjoy talking about the company. An original Gilbert Stuart portrait of George Washington stared down from behind the desk.
Steve Forbes said two-thirds of the company's profit comes from Forbes magazine, which he called "the core of the company." The magazine, published every two weeks, has long focused on the people and strategies of company management. Circulation is 767,789, up 3.7 percent from last year, enabling the magazine to raise the circulation it guarantees advertisers to 765,000 from its current 750,000, starting in January.
So far this year, ad pages have totaled 3,078, up 5.3 percent from the corresponding period last year.
"They inherited a magazine that is in very good shape, and Malcolm did groom Steve in a shrewd way," said Leo E. Scullin, president of Scullin & Company, a media consulting firm. "Forbes has managed to keep its edge through a very difficult time."
James Spanfeller, publisher of Inc., a magazine that covers growing companies, said that after Malcolm Forbes died, Forbes magazine organized a particularly aggressive and successful sales effort to maintain its position in the market. Some competitors say Forbes makes so many deals involving discounted pages -- like a free page in return for three paid ad pages -- that its position as the leader in advertising pages is meaningless.
Steve Forbes said that all discounts and bonuses are stated on the rate card. And media directors of advertising agencies say that almost all magazines offer advertisers some kind of bonus, ranging from free tickets to a tennis match to free ad pages in a sister publication.
 
The Forbes Spinoffs
 In recent years, Forbes has started a number of spinoff magazines that are aimed at segments of the Forbes readership.
FYI, for instance, goes to Forbes subscribers four times a year, free of charge. Robert Forbes, president of FYI, said advertiser response had been beyond expectations; FYI will carry 330 pages of advertising this year, up 32 percent from last year. FYI's ad pages are counted as part of the Forbes total by the Publishers Information Bureau, which tracks the magazine industry.
Last year, Forbes introduced ASAP, a magazine about technology for the general executive. Now a quarterly, it will be published six times a year starting in January.
American Heritage has also started several spinoffs under Timothy Forbes. These include Civil War Chronicles and Audacity, which focuses on the past as it relates to the present. Another spinoff, Invention and Technology, was started in 1987.
American Heritage has just introduced a consumer-oriented quarterly called Media Critic, which is a "look at ourselves and our colleagues with a critical eye," Timothy Forbes said. It has 25,000 subscribers and will also be sold on newsstands.
In separate interviews, the four brothers made the point that they would grow the business slowly, starting new magazines only when they saw a real need. And they seemed far more relaxed than many other industry executives on the subject of interactive media and the ramifications for magazines.
"If something comes along that intrigues us, we'll do it, but I don't think we'll have to do it to survive," Steve Forbes said.
"As long as you have information that is put together so it's of use to the person at the other end," he added, "you're in business. How the information is conveyed -- whether it's on paper or on a blank screen -- is immaterial to us."

HEADLINE: Hunter College's Playhouse Prepares for a New Beginning

BYLINE: By ALLAN KOZINN

 BODY:
Two seasons ago, the Hunter College Playhouse was the rundown home of a few rootless ensembles, and barely in use at that. Concertgoers old enough to remember the recitals and theater productions that had made Hunter a lively place between 1942 and 1975 could not help glancing wistfully around the tattered auditorium, or walking through the college's main building to peek into the larger Assembly Hall, where Horowitz, Heifetz, Segovia, Rubinstein, Pinza and other classical-music greats used to perform.
But after letting its performance series slide for nearly 20 years, to become a casualty of changing policies and campus overcrowding, Hunter is getting back into the business with a vengeance. The Playhouse, at 68th Street at Lexington Avenue, has been fully revamped, and Joseph A. LoSchiavo, its new administrator, has put together a schedule of 200 dance, music and theater performances. The hall opened for business quietly in April. But its official Inaugural Week begins tonight with a Lerner and Loewe revue, "The Night They Invented Champagne."
 
Stiff Competition
 Hunter's new program is likely to draw heavily on an audience already stretched thin by the recession and distracted by numerous other entertainment choices. On the East Side alone, the Playhouse is up against competition from the Tisch Center at the 92d Street Y, the Metropolitan Museum, the Frick Collection and Gould Hall. Across town, Lincoln Center, Carnegie Hall, Merkin Concert Hall, Town Hall, the Joyce Theater and other halls offer further diversions. 
 Hunter's revival is being closely watched by the 92d Street Y, 24 blocks up Lexington Avenue from the college. The competition between them may become more acute if Hunter goes through with a plan to renovate the 2,100-seat Assembly Hall and to build a new 200-seat recital hall. In a way, the performing-arts programs of Hunter and the Y intersect. Omus Hirshbein, the vice chairman of the Tisch Center, has built the Y into a major force in the New York concert world. Before he went to the Y in 1975, he ran the Hunter concert bureau until the college phased it out.
But in recent seasons his program has come under attack by a budget-conscious board. A recital series has been dropped, the series by the resident New York Chamber Symphony series has been scaled back, and an ambitious Schubertiade, which was to have presented all of Schubert's music over 10 years, has been reduced to a series of thematic Schubert concerts.
There are signs of revival this season: the Y's programs are livelier, and Mr. Hirshbein is projecting a 10 percent increase in ticket sales. But the program is still vulnerable, and the appearance of an eager competitor with a bright new hall has been met with some trepidation.
At Hunter, the 664-seat Sylvia and Danny Kaye Playhouse (named in gratitude for a $1 million contribution toward the renovation) was completed last spring, six months ahead of schedule and within its $4.8 million budget. Its threadbare seats have been replaced, the technical facilities have been updated, and a new acoustical shell has been built. The walls have been modified to better reflect the sound, dressing rooms have been expanded, and the grungy lobby has been cleaned up and modernized.
The Inaugural Week schedule suggests the tenor of Mr. LoSchiavo's programming. Besides tonight's gala, there is the opening, on Tuesday, of a chamber-music series with a new work by a woman composer on each program. The Caribbean Dance Company is to perform on Wednesday, followed by the American Tap Dance Orchestra on Thursday. A recital by Martina Arroyo is to be held on Friday, with an orchestral concert by Michael Tilson Thomas and the New World Symphony on Sunday.
"I don't think our program is typical of what you will find in New York under one roof," said Mr. LoSchiavo, who was a freelance opera director and the chief librarian at Fordham University before coming to Hunter. "But this first year is by no means as diverse as I would like our schedule to be in the future. My hope is to present the best in the performing arts of a wide variety of cultures."
"I don't perceive competition," he added. "I don't want to be Lincoln Center on the East Side. That would be a pointless intent. And I don't want to be either a clone of the 92d Street Y or a threat to them. Our programming overlaps slightly. Hunter has such a long history in music that it was expected that we would present a certain amount. But the Y doesn't offer the dance and theater programs we have, and we are not yet doing the literary programs that the Y has."
 
The 'Not Yet' Factor
 Mr. LoSchiavo's noncompetitive pronouncement notwithstanding, his "not yet" suggests designs on an area in which the Y has an edge. And indeed, the significance of Hunter's re-entry into the presentation world has not been lost on Mr. Hirshbein.
Mr. Hirshbein, actually, had his own designs on Hunter's performance facilities. For the last few years, he has explored the possibility of presenting some of the Y's concerts at Hunter. In 1990 he took an experimental step in that direction by presenting a Schubert opera -- part of the 92d Street Y's Schubertiade -- in the Assembly Hall. But with the establishment of Hunter's own presentation department, Mr. Hirshbein's plans have been shelved.
"Cooperation can definitely happen," Mr. LoSchiavo tentatively offered. "Omus and I have discussed it in general terms. But I think we need to see how we can develop on our own before we seriously explore that." And in the spirit of friendly competition, the Y allowed Mr. LoSchiavo and his team to examine, measure and copy the Y's acoustical shell.
The Y has a bigger budget, but the figures are not directly comparable. The Y's $4 million presentation budget includes musical and literary series, as well as educational outreach programs. But the Y produces its events, meaning that it pays the bill for them. At Hunter, the operating budget of $1.2 million includes some production money. But many of the events, particularly the dance and theater offerings, are rentals: the companies pay Hunter for the use of the facilities. Mr. LoSchiavo said rental fees are crucial to his budget. The budget itself, though, is a touchy issue.
"Being in the middle of a city institution that has very real financial problems, it's important that people understand that this $1.2 million is not a sum that is given to me," Mr. LoSchiavo said. "There are no tax levy funds involved. It is not part of the City University's tax levy budget, and is not coming out of any academic programs. I have to raise every dollar of my budget myself, through a combination of box office, rental fees and fund raising."
There was, however, some city money in the restoration project. Half of the $4.8 million budget came as a matching grant from New York State. New York City provided $1 million and the school raised $1.4 million in private donations, including $1 million from the Sylvia and Danny Kaye Foundation.
Mr. LoSchiavo faces a difficult juggling act. He is at the helm of an enterprise that must be financially self-sufficient. But he must also be responsive to Hunter College's needs. Some of those needs are practical -- the hall must be available for use by student ensembles -- and some are political.
"Hunter's performance program foundered on open enrollment," Mr. Hirshbein said. "There was a concern that what was perceived as the elitist persona of the hall was contrary to the mission of the college, which was that any one with a high school diploma could attend."
Open enrollment also caused a space crunch; the concert halls were pressed into service as classrooms, and the dressing rooms became faculty offices.
Hunter's East Building, which opened in 1985, alleviated the crowding. Around the same time, the school's administration began to regard arts programming as both a cultural necessity and a magnet for alumni who might contribute money to the school. The program was re-established on the condition that its offerings reflect the increasingly multicultural makeup of the student body and the city. Complying with that requirement, while keeping an eye on both the budget and the competition, is the challenge that Mr. LoSchiavo faces.
"I would be lying if I said I'm not nervous," he admitted. "You wake up in the morning and say, 'I have to be crazy to be doing this,' and then you realize that if the other people in the world who present concerts weren't also crazy, there would be no performance world."

HEADLINE: Welfare Reform, Done Harshly

 BODY:
Wisconsin's welfare reform -- putting a two-year limit on benefits -- would seem to have come straight out of President Clinton's playbook. During the campaign, he promised to "end welfare as we know it" by making benefits temporary. No wonder then that the Administration granted its approval for Wisconsin's plan last week.
But a closer look shows that the two policies veer in starkly different directions. Mr. Clinton wants to guarantee a job for parents who reach the end of the two-year period; Wisconsin doesn't. Mr. Clinton pledges generous education and training programs before the benefits run out; Wisconsin doesn't. And Mr. Clinton's advisers recognize that for welfare reform to work, it must protect children from penalties meted out to delinquent parents; Wisconsin doesn't. 
 Wisconsin, under Gov. Tommy Thompson, a Republican, will pick two counties for the experimental reform. Welfare recipients will initially be directed into training and education, but only for at most one year. During the second year, enrollees will work off their benefits in private or public jobs. After 24 months of welfare, the guaranteed jobs disappear and cash assistance is cut off for three years. The state would continue to provide food stamps, health care and, in a small number of cases, housing vouchers.
To critics, the Wisconsin plan isn't just tough; it's vicious. What happens to parents who, for no fault of their own, can't find work? Where will they get cash to buy their children soap, clothes, bus fare -- let alone an occasional book or movie ticket? Wisconsin only promises to extend benefits beyond 24 months if the local job market is dreadful; but that would still leave many unemployed in the lurch. Nor would Wisconsin help children of delinquent parents who refuse to show up for work. If they don't work, the family loses all but health benefits and food stamps.
Though Mr. Clinton's plan won't be out until next year, his statements suggest that he will at least provide the poor an opportunity to earn cash assistance through community service. And, unlike Wisconsin, he's struggling to figure out how to insulate kids from the failure of their parents.
The underlying presumption of the Wisconsin plan is that able-bodied parents who know for certain that their benefits will end, and that no job will be automatically offered to them, will figure out how to find steady work. As proof that aggressive management can work, Wisconsin points to its enviable record driving down welfare rolls the past eight years.
The Wisconsin plan might make progress in moving some welfare recipients off the rolls and into productive work. But there are virtually certain to be some ugly outcomes. And even if the experiment works to some degree, it is unlikely to be a model for reform elsewhere in the country. The experiment is isolated to relatively few families in only two counties, yet to be picked but probably prosperous, in an economically healthy state.
That would allow Wisconsin to sidestep the problems faced by urban centers where an increasing number of poor parents cannot find or hold steady jobs. The country has engaged in rounds of experiments with jobs programs, combining different levels of carrots and sticks. At best, these reforms move a few unemployed into jobs. None are hugely successful.
Wisconsin's harsh plan doesn't match the President's inviting rhetoric. But that doesn't mean he should have rejected the application. The President has pledged to provide states the leeway to experiment with social programs. And Wisconsin's track record on welfare reform is sufficiently encouraging to warrant giving it a long leash. The danger, however, is that should the plan backfire it will tarnish Mr. Clinton's more generous approach that would strive to replace welfare with a humane, effective alternative.

HEADLINE: DIALOGUE: North Korea and the Bomb;
A Deadline On Diplomacy

BYLINE: By Zalmay M. Khalilzad; Zalmay M. Khalilzad, director of strategy at the Rand Corporation, was an assistant under secretary of defense in the Bush Administration.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
North Korea is playing a frightening game of cat and mouse in its efforts to build nuclear weapons without risking significant reprisal from the international community. Other nations -- and particularly the United States -- should not let the North Koreans get away with it: we should threaten them with economic sanctions, and soon.
The bomb program came to international attention last winter, after the International Atomic Energy Agency detected that Pyongyang was diverting fissionable material from its civilian nuclear program. To determine how much diversion had occurred, the agency demanded to inspect two sites. The North Koreans refused and threatened to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. 
 But they did offer to discuss the issue with the United States. After two rounds of meetings last summer, they agreed to continue abiding by the treaty and to renew discussions with the atomic energy agency.
But Pyongyang is still refusing to allow inspection of the two sites. Not only that; it has also impeded the I.A.E.A.'s work at sites previously under routine inspection, and ultimately suspended talks with the agency -- whose director recently reported to the United Nations that monitoring cameras at the routine sites had run out. The implication is that the agency cannot tell whether still more diversion of nuclear materials is taking place.
After breaking off discussions with the agency, the North Koreans expressed a willingness to talk with the U.S. again. And last month we did.
The longer this game goes on, the closer the North Koreans get to building nuclear weapons. And if they succeed, the risks are grave. The chances of war between North and South Korea would increase. Seoul and Tokyo might well consider nuclear programs of their own. North Korean cooperation with Iran on missiles could expand to include nuclear weapons. And North Korean success in defying the I.A.E.A. could wreck our global nonproliferation policy.
The time has come to impose a deadline on the North Koreans. We should tell them that unless they allow inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency -- both routine and special -- by Dec. 1, we will seek the imposition of economic sanctions by the U.N. The sanctions would ban imports of petroleum products, exports of weapons and other products from North Korea and financial transfers to North Korea.
Effective sanctions would require the cooperation of China. To get its support, we must make cooperation on the North Korean nuclear program the litmus test of our relations. This issue should be the central item on President Clinton's agenda when he meets with the Chinese President, Jiang Zemin, in Seattle next week. He might forcefully remind Mr. Jiang of the implications for Japan's nuclear posture.
For now, as we pursue sanctions, we should take two other steps. First, we should increase our own military capability in the region, and South Korea's. This would help discourage North Korean adventurism and signal Pyongyang that it is on a dangerous course. It would also enforce a blockade, if need be.
Second, we should hold out a carrot to the North Koreans, telling themthat if they cooperate on the nuclear issue we will lead an international effort to help them and will consider ways to end North Korea's international isolation.
But it's obvious that the costs of relying solely on diplomacy are unacceptably high. Recent events in Somalia and Haiti may have emboldened the North Koreans to think they can play cat and mouse forever; to change their calculations, we need to make clear that we have decided to stop playing.

HEADLINE: School Voucher Plans Don't Improve Education;
Benefits of Choice

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "California's Experiment on Your Schools" (Op-Ed, Oct. 30), Jonathan Schorr says there's no proof that vouchers work, so let's not try them. Yet there's ample proof that public schools are not working for many of the families who are paying taxes to have children educated by them. 
 Perhaps Mr. Schorr is relying on a recent report by the Economic Policy Institute, which asserts that school choice does not help students nor create more equity for racial minorities. This is from the same group that gave us the twisted calculation that the United States spends less on education than every other industrialized country save Sweden. This report again skews the facts.
School choice programs in nearly a dozen states are made up of large numbers of low-income, minority children in well-integrated settings. Both public and private schools in which choice is exercised demonstrate not only higher achievement in academic subjects, but also a decline in dropouts, a higher average daily attendance rate, high morale, a drop in disciplinary action or none at all and greater retention of teachers.
In every experiment where a child has transferred from a public to a private school, that child is now graded against a higher standard.
In Milwaukee, home of the first example of a publicly funded school choice plan, public schools are discouraged from holding back students who show up at least half the time and are able to muster at least a D in all subjects. Conversely, most of the private schools in the choice program in Milwaukee base grades on tests, effort and the demonstration of knowledge. It will take some time before children coming out of the public school system can show on paper what they have achieved.
There are other benefits less tangible than test scores. Many of the people in California who voted for the school choice initiative that was defeated Nov. 2 are worried about crime in the schools. They're worried that their children aren't learning enough to land a job that requires more than seventh-grade skills. They're worried about public schools with minorities segregated in bad schools away from the mainstream.
In the end vouchers will give the poorest of students the choice not only to attend quality private schools, but to benefit from an improved public school system as well because a system responsive to parents will create a dynamic for improvement in all schools.

HEADLINE: Past Doesn't Repeat In Fear of Immigrants

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Fear of Immigrants Sounds an Old Theme" (letter, Oct. 28) Amy Bridges notes that New York City's foreign-born population was almost twice as high in 1855 as today, and she lauds the achievements of "that generation of immigrants." 
 But history does not repeat, and one set of newcomers is not interchangeable with others. America in the Civil War era was a developing economy with abundant natural resources and great need for workers. New York's urban complexity today, with its fragile infrastructure and congested social environment, is hardly comparable. Among the many differences are the extent of diversity, changed social values and the need for vital government services.
Back then, moreover, anti-immigrant sentiment derived largely from religious bias and snobbish natives. Today, it is to be found among working people, often newcomers themselves, in despair of access to jobs, housing, safety and decent living space.

HEADLINE: Troubled U. of Bridgeport Is Seeing a Turnaround

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRIDGEPORT, Conn., Nov. 6

 BODY:
Last year 19-year-old Ricardo Perez was teaching in an institute run by the Rev. Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church in his native Dominican Republic. Now, he's a student at the University of Bridgeport, where he lives on campus on a full $19,000-a-year scholarship.
In many ways Mr. Perez reflects the changing student body here. After years of declining enrollment, the university is making a concerted effort to recruit students from around the globe, said Edwin G. Eigel Jr., the university's president. 
 The school says 25 percent of its 1,600 students are now from 55 countries, compared to about 10 percent of foreign students two years ago. Within a few years, Mr. Eigel said, half of the students will be from foreign countries.
The university's goal, Mr. Eigel said, is to have 1,900 students next year and 3,200 in three years. The school, which had a peak enrollment of about 9,000 in the early 1970's, had dropped to just under 1,400 last year.
The new approach at Bridgeport follows the troubled university's affiliation last year with an arm of the Unification Church, the Professors World Peace Academy, which rescued the school from financial collapse under a five-year agreement to provide $50 million in aid.
 
Deny Church Membership
 Like many students, Mr. Perez said he was not a church member. But he said he agreed with its goals and philosophy and he did not consider the church a cult. Mr. Perez said many students who were Unification Church members or attended functions would not acknowledge it.
"They are very quiet about it," he said. "It can be that there is some brainwashing, but their ultimate purpose is good. If they took over the world, that would be good because there is nothing wrong with getting people from all over the world together to study."
But Naoko Miyazawa, a 19-year-old whose parents are members of the Unification Church and sent her to the university from Gifu, Japan, said she did not trust the church and was afraid to speak against it.
"I don't like the church very much, I don't want to be in it," Ms. Miyazawa said. "But I want to study in United States and this is where parents want me."
A former student, Byung Uk Kim, a 26-year-old Korean now attending the University of New Haven, said many of his friends had been pressured unduly to attend church functions.
"I think it is happening less now because they are afraid of the bad publicity," said Mr. Kim, former president of the University of Bridgeport Korean Student Association. "But Koreans don't like to make trouble for other Koreans, so nobody wants to press any formal charges," he said.
Mr. Eigel denied that students, faculty members or administrators were being pressured by anybody associated with the Unification Church and said that if students complained that anyone was harassing them, the charges were fully investigated. "I wouldn't still be here if they were trying to influence me or anybody else in any way," Mr. Eigel said. He has been president for two years and has been on the university's staff for 14 years.
But Glenn Bassett, chairman of the management department in the school's business college, said there was clearly a church influence at the school.
"It would be kind of astonishing if there weren't, wouldn't it?" said Mr. Bassett, who has been teaching at the school for 12 years. "After all they are the people who are paying the bills. But it doesn't bother me. In my estimation there are a lot of other so-called acceptable religions that are just as cultish, if not more so, than the Unification Church."
 
Student Caliber 'the Same'
 Mr. Bassett said the overall quality of students had not diminished. "The caliber of students is the same, it's just that they are now from all over the world," he said.
Some international students said they had never heard of the Unification Church when they were recruited by the university to attend the school on full scholarship. Others said they almost did not come because of it.
"I'm worried about it and I plan to transfer out of here as soon as I can," said 21-year-old Yen Feng, a physics major from Beijing. "We all talk about it and just hope we can avoid" church members.
Missy Glenn, 18, a freshman from Chicago who came to the university to play on the women's soccer team and is on full academic scholarship, said her parents were worried at first about sending her to a school with ties to the Unification Church.
"I think the diversity here is a major plus because you get points of view from people all over the world," she said. "I really haven't seen any kind of proselytizing at all and I haven't seen any church members. If that were happening, I would leave."
The president of the senior class, Erica Roesch, said she was unaware of any students being pressured by members of the church. Ms. Roesch, who is from Stratford and has attended the school throughout its last four turbulent years, said, "I'm one of the survivors and I'm glad I'm still here. I think it would have been awful if the school had closed."
But some people, like the Coalition for Concerned Citizens, composed of clergy, elected officials, university alumni, former faculty members and city residents, think Bridgeport would have been better off if the university had closed rather than been linked to the Unification Church, which they considered to be a dangerous cult.
 
Lawsuit Filed
 The coalition, founded by City Councilman William A. Finch and Rabbi Israel Stein of Congregation Rodeph Shalom, has filed a lawsuit in Superior Court in Stamford on behalf of 14 former university donors, trustees, students and professors, who maintain the university's board of trustees entered into an illegal agreement with the Professors World Peace Academy.
The basis of the suit, according to the coalition's Bridgeport lawyer, Michael Stratton, is that the agreement allows the World Peace group to have a majority representation on the board in violation of the school's charter, which requires it to be run by an independent board.
University administrators refused to comment on the suit, and said they were busy preparing for a visit next week by an evaluation team from the New England Association of Schools and Colleges -- the commission that placed the university on probation last year -- through which more than 200 institutions in New England are regularly accredited. Concern about the school's financial situation and academic standards prompted the action. The State Department of Higher Education's board of governors issued renewed state accreditation for the university in a 7-3 vote last February, but is monitoring the school closely.
Anthony J. Guerra, associate vice president of academic affairs and a member of both the academy and the Unification Church, denied any academic involvement by the church at the university. He also said he believed the church was the target of racism.
"Many religions have been called a cult, even Christianity," said Mr. Guerra.
But Glenn Davis, a 1987 University of Bridgeport graduate who is working on his master's thesis at Wesleyan University and on a book about the decline of the University of Bridgeport, said church members control the school and just about everything that goes on there. He cautioned, however, that it is done in so subtle a way as to be barely discernible.
"They influence everything because they make the decisions and are in control of the board of trustees," said Mr. Davis. "They're using the school and will use it for their own purposes down the road. It's just bizarre that here we have a known, destructive cult running an institution of higher learning right here in our backyard. It could only happen in Bridgeport."

HEADLINE: Whitman's Budget Vow May Hurt Backers

BYLINE: By TOM REDBURN

 BODY:
If Christine Todd Whitman is going to make good on her promise to cut New Jersey income taxes, her own supporters will have to pay a part of the price.
Analysts outside her circle of advisers say her task will be to persuade the suburban voters who gave her the margin of victory to sacrifice some of their most cherished government benefits, including aid to education and local governments. 
 "Is it doable? Yes. Will it be hard? Absolutely," said Michael J. Scheiring, vice president and treasurer at Thomas Edison State College in Trenton, who served as executive director of a nonpartisan commission established in 1990 by Gov. Jim Florio to review the state's budget and recommend savings.
"The real question to be asked is not whether it can be done," Mr. Scheiring added, "but just how and at what price."
 
$1.4 Billion Pledge
 In fact, Mrs. Whitman argues that other governors have already cut their budgets, notably in Michigan and Massachusetts. But others say that there are important differences in the experiences of those states that undercut the parallels. [Page B6.]
Mrs. Whitman has pledged that within three years she will find $1.4 billion to cut from a budget now running about $15.6 billion a year at a time when estimates keep climbing on just how big a gap already exists between revenue and spending.
Inevitably she will have to look at aid to municipal governments and local school districts, because they are two of the largest slices of the budget pie. They are also two areas that have powerful backers in the Legislature.
In part because of the expensive administrative duplication required by more than 600 separate school districts, New Jersey spends more per pupil on education than any other state, yet ranks below average in student achievement.
"If Christine Whitman is not willing to say no to the education establishment and take a hard stand, it is going to make it all that much harder to balance the budget," said Steven Gold, director of the Center for the Study of States in Albany.
Mrs. Whitman would also have to question a number of popular programs, like the building of even more prisons. "She would have to attack some longstanding shibboleths," Mr. Gold added. "Being 'tough on crime,' for example, is very, very expensive. The voters don't understand that. To save money, though, you would have to introduce a major reform of sentencing practices."
Other experts say that New Jersey is well behind even such traditionally generous states as New York and Massachusetts in revamping its costly Medicaid program. State spending on Medicaid has risen at an annual rate of 18 percent in recent years, from $800 million in 1989 to $2.1 billion this year.
"Introducing managed care for Medicaid, as New York is doing, will not hurt the poor and should even be to their advantage by improving primary care," said David Kehler, president of the Public Affairs Research Institute of New Jersey, a nonpartisan policy analysis organization.
Mr. Kehler said New Jersey, particularly locally, is long overdue for an in-depth review of government spending priorities. Only one-fifth of Trenton's budget goes for state operations; at least $6 billion is funneled directly to schools and municipalities.
 
Different Views in G.O.P.
 "The state has already started to tighten its belt, but you can't say the same thing has happened at the local level," he said.
Some differences have already surfaced among Republican lawmakers about how seriously to take Mrs. Whitman's plan. Donald T. DiFrancesco, the Senate President, warned immediately after the election that he may want to look at alternatives. "It's a starting point, and we're going to talk about what's doable," Mr. DiFrancesco said. "It may not be what she wants."
Assembly Speaker Garabed (Chuck) Haytaian said that he thought the cuts were realistic if the specifics were worked out through the legislative process.
Meanwhile, local political leaders are already planning their defense. They argue, as Governor Florio did, that any reduction in state aid will simply force them to increase property taxes, already among the nation's highest.
"We will cooperate with the new Governor, but we will work as hard as we can to make sure the municipal aid that we currently receive will remain intact and continue to increase," said Donald L. Fauerbach, executive director of the New Jersey Conference of Mayors. "The major urban centers are desperately in need."
 
Warning About Polarizing
 Indeed, Mayor Sharpe James of Newark said Mrs. Whitman could succeed only if she was willing to challenge her strongest supporters on their home turf. He said he feared that her election would ignite an explosive conflict between cities and suburbs over the allocation of state money.
"I would hope that the new Governor can rise to the occasion and prevent a polarizing of the state," Mr. James said. "She was elected by suburban voters and I'm worried that the cities will bear the brunt of the cuts."
During the campaign, Mrs. Whitman deliberately avoided specifying where she would find the budget savings to pay for the tax cut. She cited only a few minor examples of what she called widespread waste, like the Governor's $7 million helicopter. The rest was to be achieved through broad, but generally unspecified, budget initiatives.
Claiming as much as $500 million in savings, Mrs. Whitman listed half a dozen ideas proposed earlier by former Gov. Thomas H. Kean and by Governor Florio but never carried out. She vowed to use the governor's line-item veto to cancel $250 million in spending from this year's budget, which runs through June 1994. And she insisted she could hold the growth in state spending down to the rate of inflation, arguing that that would save $460 million.
 
Immediate Budget Crisis
 The total potential budget savings, she said in a four-page document outlining what turned out to be the keystone of her campaign, was $1.2 billion. Even without questioning whether Mrs. Whitman is counting some of the same spending cuts twice, she still fell short of the projected $1.4 billion cost of her tax-cut plan. In addition to the $1.1 billion income-tax cut, it also includes eliminating the state tax on telephone use, cutting diesel-fuel taxes and rolling back the corporate tax surcharge.
Worse, just as Governor Florio faced an unexpectedly wide budget gap when he entered office in 1990, Mrs. Whitman will be confronted by an immediate budget crisis created by Mr. Florio himself, when he used several one-time revenue gains and optimistic forecasts of tax receipts to balance this year's budget.
"Both candidates did not level with the voters about how big the budget problem is in New Jersey," said Richard C. Leone, chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and former budget director for Gov. Brendan T. Byrne. "And what makes being governor so politically precarious is that the problem cannot be solved in a way that pleases the people who vote for you."
By official figures, New Jersey's shortfall totals at least $1 billion in next year's budget. The gap is probably closer to $1.7 billion, said Michael Brooks, a government bond analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, a New York investment house.
 
Spending Cuts Urged First
 "She's got a lot bigger hole than she thinks she's got," Mr. Brooks said. "Before she can even think about cutting taxes, she will have to make really substantial cuts in spending."
But Mrs. Whitman's campaign advisers argue that approving a tax cut to be phased in over three years is the best way to give her political leverage to force a major retrenchment in state spending. And, unlike the theorists around former President Ronald Reagan who argued that steep tax cuts would pay for themselves through faster economic growth, Mrs. Whitman says she intends to reduce spending dollar for dollar with tax cuts.
"Basically, what you see is what you are going to get," said Lawrence Kudlow, who devised the plan with a small team of other experts. Mr. Kudlow, chief economist at Bear, Stearns, was a ranking adviser to David Stockman, Federal budget director during Mr. Reagan's first term. "She intends to do exactly what she told the voters she would do. And that means whatever it takes."

Prices Turn Up for Treasury Issues

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The Treasury market ended a sharp weeklong decline as prices advanced yesterday in advance of the Government's sale of new notes and new reports on inflation.
The price of the Treasury's 30-year bond gained 3/32 of a point. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, slipped to 6.19 percent, from 6.20 percent on Friday. 
 Shorter-term maturities posted bigger price gains.
 
 
Positive Economic Reports
 This was the market's first broad advance since Oct. 28. Last week, a string of positive economic reports sent Treasury prices plunging and yields on the long bond soaring by nearly a quarter of a percentage point.
Analysts tied most of yesterday's price gains to strategies by investors trying to unwind speculative trading strategies.
Before last week's price plunge, many traders who expected bond prices to drop borrowed bonds and sold them short. Yesterday, these traders bought bonds at the cheaper prices, paid off their loans and pocketed the price difference in a process called short selling.
Traders do not want to be in risky trading strategies amid the uncertainty of the Treasury's auction of three-year notes today and 10-year notes tomorrow, analysts said.
In addition, the Labor Department is releasing its producer price inflation statistics today and its consumer price inflation data on Wednesday.
"Everything is sort of the anticipation of upcoming reports," said Robert Brusca, chief economist and senior vice president at Nikko Securities International.
Economists hope the reports provide more insight into whether the economy is entering a period of faster growth that could aggravate inflation pressures.
If the reports show higher-than-expected inflation, the bond market could tumble. Inflation reduces the value of fixed-income securities like bonds.
 
 
Fear of Rate Increases
 In addition, investors are concerned that the Federal Reserve may lean toward encouraging higher interest rates as a way to keep inflation from picking up. Higher rates on new securities can reduce the value of existing bonds.
The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, added 3.92, to 1,310.45.
In its weekly bill auction, the Treasury sold $13.8 billion of three-month bills at an average discount rate of 3.11 percent and a yield of 3.18 percent.
Another $13.9 billion of six-month bills was sold at an average discount rate of 3.28 percent and a yield of 3.38 percent.
In secondary trading, the discount rate on three-month Treasury bills held at 3.04 percent. The discount rate on six-month bills fell 2 basis points, or two-hundredths of a percentage point, to 3.22 percent. And the discount rate on one-year bills fell 5 basis points, to 3.36 percent.
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds closed at 10121/32 , up 2/32 from late Friday. The average yield to maturity was unchanged at 5.65 percent. Following are the results of the Treasury's regular weekly auction of three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: With Foreign Policies Under Fire, Top State Dept. Deputy Is Ousted

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 8

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration moved today to stanch the relentless criticism of its foreign policy performance by compelling the second-highest official in the State Department to resign.
Deputy Secretary of State Clifton R. Wharton Jr., the highest-ranking black official in State Department history, submitted his resignation, effective immediately, in letters to President Clinton and Secretary of State Warren Christopher, senior White House and State Department officials said. 
 Mr. Clinton and Mr. Christopher have not decided on Dr. Wharton's replacement, but they are focusing on a foreign service veteran modeled on Lawrence S. Eagleburger, who was both a Secretary of State and the deputy in the Bush Administration, senior Administration officials said.
 
Background in Education
 Mr. Christopher is said to have long complained about what he considered Dr. Wharton's lackluster performance and reportedly told Mr. Clinton several days ago that he wanted a career diplomat in the job. Dr. Wharton is a former president of Michigan State University and was chancellor of the State University of New York system.
Rumors of Dr. Wharton's resignation have circulated in Washington for weeks as the Clinton Administration has come under fire for foreign policy failures in Bosnia, Somalia and Haiti.
But Dr. Wharton, the most prominent official to be dismissed in the Administration's 10 months in office, was not directly involved in the formulation of the policies that have run into trouble. Rather, his portfolio included the reorganization of the State Department, the foreign aid budget and the restructuring of the Agency for International Development.
It is Peter Tarnoff, the State Department's third-ranking official, who holds the title of Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, who has been Mr. Christopher's representative at White House meetings of the so-called deputies committee, where initial foreign-policy formulations are made. Ultimately, of course, foreign policy is set by the President with the Secretary of State.
Senior White House and State Department officials insisted that Dr. Wharton was not being blamed for policy setbacks and that his resignation is not the beginning of a purge of other officials.
"Dr. Wharton's reasons for leaving had nothing to do with hot spots around the world, but had everything to do with his view of the job and the Secretary's view of the job," said Michael McCurry, the State Department spokesman, in a telephone interview. "Mr. Christopher offered him the opportunity to stay in Government -- perhaps as an ambassador -- but Dr. Wharton preferred to depart."
When Mr. Christopher introduced Dr. Wharton to State Department employees on Jan. 25, he praised him as "a great human being, a great American," who "can succeed in almost anything."
But Dr. Wharton resented being pigeonholed as an administrator, telling reporters shortly after he took the office that he saw himself as Mr. Christopher's "alter ego" who would make policy in his absence, not as simply a bureaucrat.
 
'Weak Member of the Lineup'
 But that did not transpire. Mr. Christopher is said to have been disappointed with Dr. Wharton's performance for several months, and returned from vacation after Labor Day determined to replace him, senior State Department officials said.
"It became apparent that he was the weak member of the lineup," said one senior State Department official. "He is leaving in order to add a heavy hitter, preferably someone with deep experience in foreign policymaking."
Another senior Administration official said, "The sense of many in the White House and the sense of Christopher himself was that they needed a deputy to take a much broader range of things in the conduct of foreign policy."
At the White House, however, senior officials said the decision to replace Dr. Wharton was made exclusively by the State Department.
State Department officials close to Mr. Christopher said Dr. Wharton never mastered the bureaucratic intricacies of the department and was slow in making decisions, such as producing a plan to revamp the Agency for International Development.
Mr. Christopher told Mr. Clinton of his intention to replace Dr. Wharton during a meeting at the White House on Oct. 19, and Mr. Clinton concurred, senior officials said.
The plan was to have Dr. Wharton stay on for a while, perhaps to the beginning of next year, after his resignation was announced, which would have given Mr. Clinton and Mr. Christopher enough time to find a suitable replacement -- and perhaps another post for Dr. Wharton.
But after Newsweek reported in October that Dr. Wharton would resign, he met twice with Mr. Christopher who told him bluntly that he was not working out, senior officials said.
 
Meeting With Christopher
 After a second article about an impending resignation appeared in The Washington Times last week, Dr. Wharton forced the issue in a meeting with Mr. Christopher on Saturday and said he wanted to leave immediately.
"He said that he had resisted the idea of coming into Government and that he had been proven right," said one senior State Department official. "He said he felt victimized by a campaign of leaks."
In a statement laced with bitterness, Dr. Wharton praised what he called his "significant contributions" to the State Department, but added, "In the past two weeks, it became unmistakably clear that I was being subjected to the classic Washington practice of sustained anonymous leaks to the media. Therefore, I decided to resign, rather than permit my effectiveness to be further eroded. I am confident that those who know me well would never accuse me of quitting in the face of adversity."
 
Eagleburger Seen as Model
 Alhthough Mr. Clinton and Mr. Christopher have not decided on Dr. Wharton's replacement, senior officials said that among those under consideration are Thomas R. Pickering, the Ambassador to Russia; Michael H. Armacost, a former Ambassador to Japan and a former Under Secretary of State; Donald F. McHenry, a former chief representative to the United Nations; Rozanne L. Ridgway, a former Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs; and Morton I. Abramowitz, a former Assistant Secretary of State for intelligence matters and now the president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
 
Other Possibilities for Job
 Less likely because they are already functioning in important Administration positions, but also under consideration, are Winston Lord, the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, and Strobe Talbott, the Ambassador at Large for the former Soviet Union.
Of the contenders, only Mr. McHenry, a professor at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service, is black. Mr. McHenry, who has turned down an offer to become Ambassador to Brazil, said in an interview today that the Administration had not asked him whether he is interested in Dr. Wharton's job.
White House and State Department officials insisted that Dr. Wharton's resignation was not a setback for Mr. Clinton in his drive to make his Government look as diverse as America.
"The President started out wanting a Cabinet and Government that looked like America and he remains committed to that," said Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary. "There will certainly be other African-Americans serving at the highest levels of this Administration, and the President doesn't see this as a setback in terms of diversity."
Dr. Wharton was in his office at the State Department today, but did not return phone calls.
Before he became a university administrator, Dr. Wharton was the first black leader of a Fortune 500 company as chairman and chief executive of the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association-College Retirement Equities Fund in New York, one of the world's largest pension funds, with more than $100 billion in assets.

HEADLINE: Herman Nolen, 92, Chairman Emeritus Of Drug Corporation

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON

 BODY:
Herman Christian Nolen, chairman emeritus of the McKesson Corporation, the San Francisco-based manufacturer and distributor of drugs and health and beauty care products, died on Sunday at Bethesda Memorial Hospital in Delray Beach, Fla. He was 92 and lived in Delray Beach.
He suffered a brief illness after a stroke, his family said. 
 Mr. Nolen led the company, now 160 years old, during a period of strong growth and diversification. He raised eyebrows in the pharmaceutical industry when he took what was then McKesson & Robbins into the distribution of generic drugs manufactured under its control in Mexico, Colombia and the Sudan. McKesson's annual sales now top $10 billion.
Mr. Nolen, who was born and reared in Muskegon, Mich., received a bachelor's degree from the University of Wisconsin, a master's degree from the University of North Carolina and a Ph.D. from Ohio State University.
 
Wrote Book on Chain Stores
 He began his career as a professor of marketing at Ohio State, where he wrote several books, including "The Chain Store Problem," an analysis of the comparative efficiency of independent stores and chains. The 1938 volume, written with Theodore N. Beckman, was reissued in 1976 by Ayer Company Publications and remains in print.
In World War II he helped the War Production Board establish an economics section for the Allied Military Government of Occupied Territories, and served in the occupation of Sicily and Italy. In 1943, Mr. Nolen, by then a colonel, joined the Allied supreme command in England to plan the military government's program for the civilian economy of occupied Germany.
He is survived by his wife, Julia Bird Nolen; two sons, Wilson Nolen of Manhattan and Chapin Nolen of Bedford, N.Y.; a stepdaughter, Jane Stearns of West Springfield, Mass.; a sister, Helen Peterman of Muskegon, six grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Tokyo Panel Urges Loosening of Bonds on Business

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 8

 BODY:
In its first effort to reduce the Government's power over Japan's minutely regulated economy, a commission appointed by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa called today for the elimination or easing of 475 regulations governing the nation's legal and economic systems.
The proposals, which were in an interim report hastily prepared so that Mr. Hosokawa can present it to President Clinton this month at a planned meeting in Seattle, were ambitious but conspicuous in their lack of details. 
 The commission proposed everything from making it simpler to open large department stores and liquor shops to encouraging housing construction and easing quotas on fish imports. It called for creation of Japan's first product liability law and something that would mark a minor revolution in a country that permits dozens of cartels -- strict application of the anti-monopoly laws.
The report offered a vision of an economy making a historic turn toward freer markets, saying at one point, "Economic activity should be founded on the basic idea of freedom from regulations in principle, with regulated areas the exception."
 
'No Sacred Cows'
 Gaishi Hiraiwa, head of a powerful business organization and chairman of the commission, said at a news conference, "Our position is there are no sacred cows."
But several experts said there was little reason to believe that the plan would achieve any more success than several previous ones aimed at reducing the country's huge trade surpluses and presenting Japan as an unthreatening citizen of the world.
In addition, an appendix to the report merely listed 475 laws by name, without specifying in most instances what should be done about them.
Japan's trading partners have long pressed Tokyo to ease its regulations to increase competition, reduce prices and make it easier for foreign companies to sell their goods. But some Japanese economists say the deregulation of Japan's markets will not necessarily lead to an increase in imports to Japan.
"In terms of Japan's surpluses, deregulation basically means nothing," said Yukio Noguchi, a leading economist and a professor at Hitotsubashi University. "This isn't the solution."
 
Rice Policy Defended
 The Government also seemed to be backpedaling on some sensitive issues already. For instance, the commission suggested that Japan should remove barriers on its rice market, a politically loaded issue. But Masayoshi Takemura, the chief cabinet secretary, quickly announced that the Government had no intention of altering its rice policy.
"As you can expect, the hard part is yet to come," Toyoo Gyohten, chairman of the Bank of Tokyo and a commission member, said in an interview.
The Advisory Group for Economic Restructuring, as it is known, was appointed several months ago by the new Prime Minister as a step toward fulfilling campaign promises to tame the government bureaucracy, reduce astronomical prices and improve the quality of life of Japanese consumers.
Many businessmen have argued that the measures, if enacted, would make it easier for entrepreneurs to innovate and help multinational companies compete in markets that are growing tougher all the time.
"In a certain sense the report grew out of the fear that the Japanese economy cannot survive in the 21st century in its present form," Mr. Gyohten said.
 
Friction With U.S.
 Not least, it was also widely hoped that the commission's recommendations would begin to whittle down Japan's surpluses and thus remove a considerable source of friction with the United States. The goal is to expand demand and revitalize domestic markets. Thus, Japan would import more, and companies here would be able to grow by servicing their home market rather than exporting.
But for the most part, the report is aimed at the domestic economy and is intended to address a silent but growing anger over the fact that the Japanese consumer has been given little of the benefit of the enormous economic might amassed here. Mr. Hosokawa is getting record approval ratings in polls in part because of a perception that he is committed to helping consumers.
"What we sensed was a very conspicuous sense of frustration, particularly from the private sector," Mr. Gyohten said. "They are simply fed up."
While economists in the West have tended to look at all capitalist economies as being basically similar because of the supremacy of the markets, the Japanese have long clung to the view that state support is essential in nurturing certain businesses and making industries competitive internationally.
 
Reducing Government Intrusion
 The fundamental policy underlying the commission's report, however, is that the time has come to reduce government intrusion in the economy. It speaks repeatedly of "the principles of self-responsibility," which means businesses have to get used to fending for themselves.
In addition, the report suggests that Japan should become a nation of laws rather than of bureaucratic fiat. Currently, bureaucrats can influence businesses using what is known as "administrative guidance," meaning dictates that are often not even written down.
The commission sought to improve prospects for the enactment of its proposals by recommending the creation of two new bodies with oversight responsibility. It suggested that the Prime Minister head one council to push for scrapping unnecessary rules and prepare a five-year deregulation program.
In addition, the commission proposed the creation of an independent body to monitor deregulation.
"This is not a panacea," Mr. Gyohten said. "It's not a bonanza for the society as a whole. Deregulation means in the first stage some loss of jobs. So we have to suffer in that sense. People have to know it's not all rosy, at least at first."

HEADLINE: Other States' Cuts, Cited by Whitman, Were Less Severe Than Her Proposals

BYLINE: By TOM REDBURN

 BODY:
When Christine Todd Whitman was challenged over her plan to slash state taxes and spending in New Jersey, she often replied that if other governors could do so, so could she.
Her advisers frequently point to Massachusetts and Michigan, along with Arizona, as examples of states where Republicans succeeded in reversing years of supposed Democratic profligacy after entering office. 
 "We drew very heavily from the Michigan experience," said Lawrence Kudlow, a Wall Street economist who was instrumental in drawing up Mrs. Whitman's tax proposal. "We also looked at Massachusetts, Wisconsin and Arizona as examples of what is possible. And we looked at California, where Pete Wilson came in and accepted a large tax increase without solving the financial deficit, as how not to do it."
But others say that the experiences of other states reveal as much about the differences with New Jersey as they do about the similarities.
"In Michigan, Massachusetts and Arizona, there was very little parallel between those states and what Christine Whitman is proposing," argues Steven Gold, director of the Center for the Study of States. "They may have prevented taxes from rising, but none of them went as far as she is proposing in cutting revenues."
Michigan and Massachusetts, both major industrial states with similarly sized budgets to New Jersey, elected Republicans in 1990, following eight years under a Democratic governor.
In Massachusetts, Gov. William F. Weld managed to sharply hold down spending and instituted several smaller tax cuts despite facing a legislature controlled by Democrats. And his personal popularity remains high in a state dominated by Democratic voters.
"It certainly seems like he will be re-elected," said Gerry Chervinsky, director of a public opinion research firm who serves as the poll taker for The Boston Globe. "This is largely a middle-class, high-tax state and the cuts have been popular. He did exactly the opposite of Jim Florio in New Jersey and absolutely refused to raise taxes."
 
Conflict in Michigan
 In Michigan, Gov. John Engler has had a somewhat different experience. He is embroiled in a major political fight with a deeply divided legislature, which has approved a plan to eliminate property taxes next year as a financing source for schools. But there is no agreement between the Governor and lawmakers over how to replace the lost revenue.
According to Patty Woodworth, Michigan's budget director, Mr. Engler faced a $1.8 billion deficit when he entered office, comparable with the gap that is likely to greet Mrs. Whitman. The Michigan Governor, while managing to restore fiscal balance, has not pushed through any major tax cuts. The sharp reduction in local property taxes, worth about $6.5 billion, is destined to be almost entirely offset by other tax increases.
"Our goal is not so much to reduce the overall tax burden sharply as to redistribute it," said Ms. Woodworth, a veteran, like Mr. Kudlow, of the Federal Office of Management and Budget.
"There's no question that our property taxes will be much lower, while our sales taxes, which are low by national standards at 4 percent, will certainly rise," she said. "To attract business and individuals, we want to put ourselves more in the middle of the pack."
 
Looking to Massachusetts
 Despite some differences, the closest parallel to Mrs. Whitman's situation is probably that of Governor Weld of Massachusetts, a Republican who took office in 1991 after Michael S. Dukakis left after his failed Democratic bid for the Presidency in 1988.
Dominick Slowey, Massachusetts' assistant secretary for administration and finance, said that when Mr. Weld took over, the state faced a $2.6 billion budget gap.
The task was certainly not painless. Mr. Weld forced state workers to take unpaid furloughs as long as three weeks, denied all supplemental requests for spending and so sharply reined in the budget that spending actually fell for the first time in 31 years -- from $13.6 billion in the 1991 fiscal year to $13.4 billion in 1992.
Like Michigan, Massachusetts closed several mental hospitals, farmed out some government services to private firms, and forced thousands of people off the rolls of a special supplemental welfare program.
The state introduced managed care for Medicaid, sharply cutting the growth of health-care spending. Within 18 months, the state had a $200 million surplus. Massachusetts is now spending about $15.5 billion, almost the same as the spending in New Jersey's budget.
In addition, Mr. Weld pushed through a repeal of a sales-tax increase adopted by the previous legislature, maintained a $225 million rollback of income taxes, and achieved several additional tax cuts worth more than $250 million a year.
Mr. Weld, however, retreated from his campaign advocacy of much more extensive tax reduction after voters rejected a separate initiative on the plan. "As Governor, he cut taxes far less deeply than Christine Whitman suggests, with far greater consequences than she projects," says James Braude, director of the Tax Equity Alliance for Massachusetts, which opposed the state tax cut initiative.
Still, under Governor Weld, Massachusetts has managed to curb government spending and has started to witness a modest upswing in the state economy.
"The bureaucracy is not going to volunteer to cut itself down," Mr. Slowey said. "The only way to force the state to rein in its appetite is to take the money off the table up front."

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Complexities of the Middle of the Road

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 8

 BODY:
There is a certain grandeur to President Clinton's proposed Health Security Act, to the sheer reach of the thing, from Title I, Subtitle B, Section 1114, g(2A), authorizing Pap tests every two years for women aged 50 to 65, to Title X, Subtitle C, Section 10201(a), creating a 15-member Commission on the Integration of Health Benefits.
There is a certain pride in the White House over the sweep and intricacy of the 1,342 pages, which roll like the work of a bureaucratic Tolstoy from the procedures on the posterior teeth of children under the age of 13 to the borrowing authority for regional alliances to cover cash shortages. 
 "The President, in bringing his Health Security Plan to Congress, demonstrates a level of detail and comprehensiveness that is not only not seen in other plans, but is also quite unique in health care in general," said Marla Romash, a spokeswoman for the White House on health.
On benefits, premium costs, deductibles and organization matters large and small, Ms. Romash said, "the President spells it out."
But the very complexity of the plan has also emerged as one of its principal political vulnerabilities. "Having trouble understanding the Clinton health plan?" asked the conservative Heritage Foundation, reprinting a mind-numbing organizational chart for the proposed system.
Democratic and Republican lawmakers are asking about the duties, powers, interrelationships and budgets of the proposed National Health Board and the regional alliances, a new form of government -- or quasigovernment -- through which millions would buy their insurance.
 
Spelling It All Out
 Republicans warn darkly of "another Big Government bureaucratic nightmare," as Representative Robert L. Livingston of Louisiana put it in his party's response to Mr. Clinton's recent radio address. Advocates of Government-financed systems like Canada's or Medicare writ large argue that at least people can understand how their systems would work.
Much of that is the predictable partisan and ideological positioning that would occur with any effort to overhaul the health system. Moreover, as Ms. Romash suggests, some of the initial shock of detail stems from the Administration decision to spell out in legislation what would, eventually, have to be dealt with through rules and regulations under any major plan.
For all that, the structural complexity of the Clinton plan worries some analysts, including James Q. Wilson, a professor of management and public policy at the University of California at Los Angeles. In an op-ed piece for The Wall Street Journal and in an interview, Mr. Wilson argued that Mr. Clinton's plan, with its emphasis on regulating and centralizing decisions now made by millions of people in one-seventh of the economy, was at odds with his promise to reinvent a leaner government.
 
'Managing the Complexity'
 Some critics fear that the public, already fed up with the demands of the present health system, is looking for simplicity that the Clinton plan will not deliver. Other figures in public-policy circles are beginning to wonder just how well the plan would be carried out and administered, where the expertise would come from to manage the alliances and how to retain that expertise.
"It isn't the complexity of the thing, it's managing the complexity," said Harvey Sapolsky, a professor of public policy and organization at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
The alliances, after all, do not now exist, at least not on anything like the scale envisioned by the President. But they would in a few years be created to cover virtually every American except those working for large corporations that set up their own plans.
The alliances would have numerous responsibilities like negotiating with health plans, compiling and distributing performance "report cards" and responding to complaints. They would collect premiums from employers, manage the web of subsidies for low-income employees and small businesses in their regions, negotiate fees with doctors who chose to stay outside health maintenance organizations and practice fee-for-service medicine and engage in a host of other tasks.
 
Fears of Politicization
 As the details filter out, there are more than a few jitters on Capitol Hill. A senator who sympathizes with the Clinton Administration and insisted on anonymity said he worried that the system of alliances would lead to "a huge politicization of medicine."
The cost controls are also complex. The Canadian system admired by many liberals in Congress negotiates with doctors and sets rates while setting budgets for hospitals each year. The Clinton plan seeks a more politically palatable indirect approach, through a premium cap beginning with a "national per capita baseline premium target" set by the National Health Board, adjusted for each alliance by a regional inflation factor and other variables in a formula spelled out in the bill.
The question behind the debate, of course, is whether the plan had to be so complicated. Administration officials argue that it did, simply because the system is now so intricate and fragmented, and the Administration was committed to building on that rather than scrapping it and creating something entirely new.
But the Administration also made basic decisions that pushed it toward complexity. Early on, the Administration ruled out both confining itsplan to modest changes for the industry and, at the other extreme, moving to a "single-payer," or Canadian-style system, which it considered politically unfeasible. Instead, the Administration embraced what its officials saw as a Clintonian third way, the philosophy of managed competition, a blend of market and regulatory forces.
Paradoxically, several analysts said, the effort to strengthen the market involves considerable regulation. The alliances are presented as a means of giving consumers power and encouraging competition among health plans while protecting the quality of care. But the alliances also constitute a new layer of bureaucracy and regulation.
 
'Yes, It Was Inevitable'
 The Administration also chose not to rely on competition alone to hold down costs, but decided to impose a form of budget to control costs, in the end, settling on a premium cap. That also required a more intricate administrative structure.
"Once the President made the decision that he wouldn't go all the way in either direction, either regulatory or free market, yes, it was inevitable that this would be complicated, an attempt to meld two very different visions of the way the health-care system should work," said Drew Altman, head of the Kaiser Family Foundation.
The Administration also sought a middle ground on financing, deciding against a broad-based tax and a payroll tax in particular. That led to the system of premiums with subsidies to cushion smaller low-wage businesses.
"Clearly, they made a political judgment that taxes and a more straightforward way of financing this were not going to fly in Congress," said John Rother, legislative director of the American Association of Retired Persons. "So a lot of the complexity here is an end run around the T word."
 
Rebutting an Issue
 Administration officials dismiss the notion that theirs is a Big Government solution. The shift to a single-payer system would be far more radical, they say. They also argue that their plan would replace a more complicated, and less equitable, status quo. And the President's political advisers suggest that the complexity factor is a manufactured issue.
"The insiders are wrapped up in what the organizational chart looks like," said Stan Greenberg, the President's pollster. "People don't care about that. They care about what their insurance will cover, what it will cost."
Still, there are concerns that the basics could be lost. "The tremendous complexity of the legislation and the difficulty the public has in understanding it," Mr. Altman said, "really makes them vulnerable to the spin controllers and the organized interests."

HEADLINE: Stocks Edge Upward as Dow Gains 4.47

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
Apparently winded after a week of agitated trading, investors nudged stocks forward yesterday, warily holding some of their orders while waiting for the Government to release reports on inflation today and tomorrow.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 234.3 million shares, one of the lowest totals in months and about 30 million shares less than the session average for the year. Volume on the American Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq also sagged. 
 But with the bond market steady and anxiety over rising interest rates ebbing, at least for now, most of the major indicators edged up and all three markets showed breadth for the first time in a week. On the Big Board, advancing issues led declining issues by about 4 to 3.
The Dow Jones industrial average, which careered through last week, rose 4.47 points, to 3,647.90, led by Caterpillar, up 1 3/8, to 91 3/8; Procter & Gamble, up 1, to 54 3/8, and Eastman Kodak, up 7/8, to 62.
Analysts said many investors appeared cautious after the frenzy of last week, when the Dow hit two record highs before it plummeted in extremely heavy trading. The markets staged a mild recovery on Friday.
Investors are also pausing before the Government's inflation reports for October are issued, analysts said. The Producer Price Index is to be released today and the Consumer Price Index is to be released tomorrow.
Economists say they generally expect a two-tenths of 1 percent rise in producer prices and a four-tenths of 1 percent gain in consumer prices. But they caution that the indexes will be influenced by the new 4.3 cent Federal gasoline tax.
If the numbers jump sharply, the bond market may drop, forcing up yields. That will probably drag down the stock market because investors may switch from equities to fixed-rate securities. The stock market has prospered this year on a surge of money from people seeking higher returns.
"It's a relatively lackluster stock market, with a mild degree of nervousness," said Alan R. Ackerman, executive vice president at Reich & Company. "If there is a sense that inflation is not a problem, then the market is likely to do better later in the week. But it's a market that is stop and go and continues to be volatile."
Underscoring that hesitancy was the Dow Jones utilities average, which many analysts consider an important indicator of the market's direction because its components are sensitive to interest rates. The index, which hit a 10-month low last week, closed down 0.13 point yesterday, to 227.13.
The utilities index was one of the only major indicators to drop. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 0.64 point, to 460.21. The American Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.27 points, to 476.60. And the Nasdaq composite index rose 3.22 points, to 766.21.
High-technology, life insurance, bank, health care and automobile stocks did well yesterday, while tobacco, oil and telecommunications issues suffered.

Dollar Declines as Traders Profit From Recent Advance

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar fell against other leading currencies yesterday, as traders took profits from its recent rise.
"The dollar's going through a consolidation," John Nelson, vice president at Barclays, said. 
 The dollar remained weak for most of the day after dropping in early trading against both the German mark and the Japanese yen. In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 107.80 yen, down from 108.40 yen on Friday. It also fell to 1.6843 marks, from 1.6930 marks.
Gold, meanwhile, also lost ground. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for December delivery fell $2.30, to $375.50 an ounce.
"Japanese economic problems are plaguing the yen and people expect the dollar to move higher," Paul Yarden of the Bank of Montreal said. "But there's still hesitancy to buy the dollar against the yen as trade balance issues are still not resolved."
 
 
Bentsen Concerned Over Japan
 In the past, a weaker dollar has been used to battle Japan's huge trade surplus with the United States. But lately the dollar has been rising because of the severely weak Japanese economy.
The Treasury Secretary, Lloyd Bentsen, urged Tokyo yesterday to stimulate consumer spending and expressed concern that Japan's economy seemed to be slowing. He also said he was comfortable with current exchange rates.
Later yesterday, a senior United States Treasury official said Japan looked unlikely to put forward a plan to stimulate its economy before Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa meets President Clinton in Seattle later this month.
Despite yesterday's setback to the dollar, dealers noted that overall market sentiment remained bullish. A recent advance in American interest rates has made dollars more attractive, since rates in Europe, Japan and Canada are falling.
The British pound, meanwhile, closed in New York at $1.4810, down from $1.4840 late Friday. Other late dollar rates, compared with Friday's quotes, included: 1.4845 Swiss francs, down from 1.4933; 5.8665 French francs, down from 5.8850; 1,643 Italian lire, down from 1,646, and $1.2960 (Canadian), up from $1.2914 (Canadian).

Chief of CVS Unit Promoted To President's Job at Melville

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The Melville Corporation said yesterday that Harvey Rosenthal, president and chief executive of its CVS drugstore unit, would become its president and chief operating officer in January.
Mr. Rosenthal, who is 50, has headed CVS, which is Melville's largest subsidiary, since 1984. He joined CVS in 1969 after earning an M.B.A. from the Harvard Business School. 
 Mr. Rosenthal succeeds Stanley P. Goldstein, Melville's 59-year-old chairman and chief executive, as president. Mr. Goldstein will retain his other posts. The chief operating officer's post is newly created.
Melville said Thomas M. Ryan, 41, would succeed Mr. Rosenthal at CVS. He is currently the subsidiary's executive vice president of operations.
When he was a CVS executive, Mr. Goldstein had a hand in hiring Mr. Rosenthal, and the two men have worked together ever since.
"Over the years Harvey Rosenthal and Stanley Goldstein have had a very, very close relationship," said Robert Roth, a securities analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company.
 
Promotion Based on Perfromance
 But Mr. Roth said Mr. Rosenthal's promotion was based on performance, not on friendship. During his tenure at CVS, sales have risen to around $4 billion, roughly 40 percent of Melville's annual revenues.
And in a telephone interview, Mr. Goldstein indicated the appointment does not represent Mr. Rosenthal's appointment as his successor.
"Clearly, Harvey is a strong candidate," Mr. Goldstein said. "But I am 59 years old and plan to be here for quite a while."
Mr. Rosenthal will join Mr. Goldstein and Robert D. Huth, Melville's 47-year old executive vice president and chief financial officer, at the top of Melville's management.
With Mr. Rosenthal's background in sales and marketing, Mr. Roth said, the executive's primary task will be to put some bounce in Melville's earnings, which he said had been "fairly sluggish, even compared with other retailers." Melville is one of the country's largerst speciality retailers. Based in Rye, N.Y., the company owns Marshalls, Medisco, Key-Bee toy stores and other stores.
In a separate interview, Mr. Rosenthal said consumers, who have been extremely cautious for several years, are beginning to show some signs of life.
"In recent years retailing has been impacted by the economy and the recession, particularly on the East and West coasts, where many of Melville's stores are located," he said. "But little by little we think we are seeing improvement, and we are optimistic about 1994."
Mr. Goldstein said Mr. Rosenthal "comes at things through the customer's eyes and mind and has proven he has been able to adjust to the changes that have taken place in an extremely competitve, deflationary environment."
In addition to his M.B.A., Mr. Rosenthal also received an A.B. from Harvard. He and his family will relocate to the New York area from Woonsocket, R.I., where CVS is based.

HEADLINE: In Los Angeles, a Museum on a Roller Coaster

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
The earth didn't actually quake. But to those at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the effects of the last 18 traumatic months may make it feel as if the Big One had hit.
The museum was still enjoying tremendous growth when its director, Earl A. Powell 3d, resigned in April 1992 to head the National Gallery in Washington, one of the most prestigious jobs in the arts in America. From a fledgling institution in 1965, it had become the most comprehensive art museum west of Chicago. More than $80 million of private money had been raised during Mr. Powell's 12-year regime to put up new buildings to house the growing collection and the blockbuster exhibitions that regularly stopped there. Annual operating costs had topped a whopping $30 million, but the museum felt secure that about half of that would be picked up by the County of Los Angeles under a contractual commitment any museum could envy. 
 Now this museum finds itself digging out from the rubble of the last year and a half. The most wrenching and visible sign of crisis was the shockingly brief tenure of Mr. Powell's replacement, Michael E. Shapiro, who struggled in vain to deal with problems for which he himself admits he was not prepared.
The museum boomed in the 80's, when Los Angeles did. So when the city slumped in the 90's, the museum was perhaps bound to suffer, too. The riots didn't make it easier in straitened economic times for an art institution and its new white male director to compete for dwindling public money.
Mr. Shapiro found himself in a financial quagmire. Amid Southern California's deep recession, millions of dollars of supposedly immutable county support for the museum disappeared. So did a substantial chunk of the museum's membership. The loss of income forced dozens of staff cutbacks, helped spur resignations and compelled the museum to shut its doors two days a week instead of one.
On top of it all, disgruntled staff members and major donors entangled the museum in litigation. This added to a bitter atmosphere in which trustees wrangled among themselves about how to overcome the turmoil they had failed to anticipate, even as they remained fixed on further expansion.
In some ways, the story of the Los Angeles County Museum is emblematic of problems that cultural institutions across the country face. During the flush years of the 80's, museums organized one lavish loan show after another, and constructed one new wing after another in which to hold them. Bigger was often simply assumed to be better. Socking away endowment money as security seemed unglamorously and unduly bearish in bullish times. Now some of these organizations find themselves burdened with operations they can't support.
At the same time, as the 10-month tenure of Mr. Shapiro illustrates, museum directors who can successfully grapple with the new and complex jumble of financial and artistic challenges are as rare as Michelangelos, if not rarer.
In an atmosphere of shrinking resources and increasing competition, major museums from the Museum of Modern Art in New York to the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston to the Seattle Art Museum are all looking for directors who combine the talents of Lee Iacocca and Bernard Berenson. The problem is: who can fit that bill?
Mr. Shapiro was a neophyte, a curator at the St. Louis Art Museum with no directorial experience when, to the surprise of many museum professionals, he won the job here. Mr. Powell had also been a youthful curator when he became director, and the trustees remembered that. They were persuaded, too, by Mr. Shapiro's innovative ideas about education and community involvement, as well as by his artistic expertise. What trustees describe as his eloquent talk about making the museum more accessible and relevant to the diverse population of Los Angeles identified him, they felt, as the ideal man for the 90's.
To ask the trustees what went wrong at the museum is to hear a rehearsed chorus. "We were blindsided," said Julian Ganz Jr., the chairman of the trustees' executive committee. "No one could have seen it coming." He was referring to the county's decision to make severe cuts in funds to the museum shortly after Mr. Powell's resignation and before Mr. Shapiro's arrival. "We have a contract with the county," Mr. Ganz added, "and it is not living up to the terms of that contract. The county was like a $350 million endowment."
Yet even before Mr. Powell left there had been signs that the recession would have an effect on the museum; for one thing, memberships started to drop. Roughly half the cost of running the place comes from the county, but the other half comes from private contributions, like membership, admission fees, gifts and endowment, so that even if the county had not cut back subsidies from $16.9 million to what is now $13.4 million a year, the museum would have had a money crunch.
Having raised tens of millions to build new galleries bearing the names of their donors, the trustees had never seen the need to put together an endowment to cover operating costs, banking on the county and on steady membership to pay the bills. The museum's endowment of around $22 million is minuscule for a large urban museum.
Robert F. Maguire 3d, the current board president, concedes the point: "We were hit by two things. One was the county cuts. Should we have anticipated them? Maybe. Second, on the private side, the giving went down about the same amount. Should we have had additional private endowment? Sure."
About whether the museum, like others around the country, had imprudently emphasized growth during the 80's under Mr. Powell, setting the stage for trouble, Daniel Belin, the chairman of the museum, insists the answer is no. "The museum has to present itself as the vehicle through which great art can be shown to the public," he said. "Otherwise the collector and donor won't respond. That's why it was essential to build the new buildings."
 
 
Galleries
Space Is Available: What to Put in It?
 The Robert O. Anderson building, a wing of the museum opened in 1986, was built not only to add exhibition and gallery space but also to entice collectors of 20th-century art in a city that has some especially large and distinguished modern art collections.
No such collectors, however, have pledged what they own to the museum since Anderson opened, and now the rival Museum of Contemporary Art is stiffening the competition. "The 20th-century collections have expanded, but we have not attracted large collections," Mr. Belin acknowledges. "It's on a picture-by-picture, sculpture-by-sculpture basis."
More than one architecture critic has said that the hodgepodge of buildings the museum has constructed, beginning with the trio of dull modernist boxes that the firm of William L. Pereira & Associates designed in 1965, turned it into a kind of world's fairgrounds. Individual patrons focused on their own pavilions, but there was no coherent overall scheme.
Anderson had, in fact, been advertised as a structure that would unify the group of buildings, but it failed to do so, as Mr. Maguire, a developer known for the high architectural quality of his own projects, admits. "We have an amalgam of buildings that have to be pulled together architecturally," he says. "We have to come up with a rational, functional plan."
The same is true for the wide-ranging collection. Everyone at the museum points proudly to sheer breathtaking growth under Mr. Powell's directorship, but Mr. Maguire and his fellow trustees are hard pressed to come up with areas of it that are highly distinguished on a national level. The strengths of the museum's holdings make for an oddly disjointed list: the Robert Gore Rifkind Center for German Expressionist Studies, the Arthur Gilbert collection of decorative arts. The museum conspicuously failed to win, among other great Southern California collections, Walter Annenberg's Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings. Asian art, which includes some of the museum's strongest material, has always been treated as a stepchild, as it is in many American art museums.
Furthermore, when the institution opened beside the La Brea tar pits on Wilshire Boulevard 28 years ago, there was little competition in the Los Angeles area. Now there is not only the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art but also the J. Paul Getty Museum and the Norton Simon Museum, which owns the world's finest collection of European paintings put together after World War II.
 
 
Leadership
Lawsuits, Grousing And Other Troubles
 Mr. Maguire says that "all of the museums in the area could profit from working closely together in terms of programming." And before a new director is picked, he adds, the board must finally deal substantively with the museum's mission, a mission that he believes should take more into account the interests of the area's growing Asian and Hispanic populations. "Where is the public we are trying to serve?" he asked.
That is a question Mr. Shapiro also asked. But before he could answer it he was out the door. Almost everyone at the museum praises him for his good ideas and intelligence, and points out that not even an experienced director could have dealt easily with the crisis of the county cutbacks and the layoffs that followed.
But Mr. Shapiro revealed his inexperience in removing Maurice Tuchman, a longtime senior curator of 20th-century art, from his job, which prompted a lawsuit by Mr. Tuchman. Even those at the museum who privately say that after more than 25 years Mr. Tuchman had been in his job long enough feel that Mr. Shapiro's attempt to move him into a new post as head of 20th-century drawings was botched: the director failed to understand the intricacies of county employee rights, they point out, and tried to argue that the removal was based on minor job infractions. At the beginning of November, the museum announced that the suit had been resolved out of court and that Mr. Tuchman was to be returned to his post.
A number of trustees also complained that Mr. Shapiro lacked managerial and personal skills. Joe D. Price, a one-time trustee who gave the museum his major collection of Japanese screens and paid for the idiosyncratic building designed by Bruce Goff to house it, became increasingly disgruntled during Mr. Shapiro's tenure. Eventually he, too, filed suit against the museum, contending that the terms of his donation had not been honored and that some screens he had lent the museum should be returned.
Mr. Shapiro also annoyed officials at other museums when he said he wanted to back out of a traveling retrospective they were organizing of the work of the contemporary painter R. B. Kitaj because he was not an enthusiast of the artist. (The show is now back on the schedule.)
Finally, some senior curators, while appreciating Mr. Shapiro's attempts to involve them more in decision-making, stewed over why one of their own from a smaller museum had been chosen as their superior, and moreover why they had not even been consulted by the trustees before his appointment. "There was no honeymoon period," Mr. Shapiro says, who since leaving in August has moved back to St. Louis.
He concedes he made some mistakes out of inexperience, the first and most critical of which was his failure to get a clear picture of the museum's finances before he took the job. "No question about it," he said. "I'll be so careful next time that they'll think Price-Waterhouse is coming at them."
The chastened trustees -- although not unanimous on this point -- may do things differently themselves next time calling for advice from staff members and outsiders as "sounding boards," said Mr. Maguire, who in the meanwhile has put Stephanie Barron, a longtime and respected curator of 20th-century art, in charge of curatorial affairs. Ronald B. Bratton, the chief deputy director, oversees administrative and financial matters.
 
 
The Future
The Positive Spin: Others Worse Off
 If some officials of the Los Angeles County Museum privately express anxiety about the future of the institution, everyone knows how bad news can deter potential donors, employees and loans for exhibitions. So publicly the museum is united in trying to put the same positive spin on the current situation: it is nothing like the one at the Detroit Institute of Arts, they point out, where cutbacks in public money combined with an inadequate endowment have forced the museum to the brink of shutdown.
The museum here, staff members and trustees insist, went through a rough period but has come out of it debt-free and wiser. Some county cutbacks have already been recouped. Lawsuits, like the ones involving Mr. Tuchman and Mr. Price, are being resolved. And both trustees and the county understand the symbolic and practical importance of returning the museum quickly to a normal six-day schedule. Some younger, enthusiastic trustees are bringing a fresh perspective to the notoriously fractious board, and while important curators have left, and positions remain unfilled, Mr. Shapiro added J. Patrice Marandel as head of European paintings and sculpture to a staff that is still good. There is also a full slate of important exhibitions, some organized by the museum, like "Expressionist Utopias" and the forthcoming "Picasso and the Weeping Women."
"We're here, we're active, we're engaged," says Ms. Barron.
The museum is even on the verge of further expansion, contemplating the construction of a roughly $5 million sculpture garden, as well as the acquisition, for somewhere between $15 million and $20 million, of more than eight acres near the museum, a site occupied by the landmark May Company department store. Finally, a joint lawsuit by the museum and Stanford University against the Church of Christ, Scientist, over the complicated disposition of the estates of two wealthy Christian Scientists is nearing a settlement, to be heard by the courts on Dec. 14. It could provide a windfall of nearly $24 million to the museum, more than doubling the meager endowment.
But whether all that means the museum is fully on track is another matter. Without a clear sense of the shape and scope of the institution on which they can all agree, the trustees have yet to prove they have overcome the strategic confusion that led to Mr. Shapiro's tenure.
They are agreed on one issue: Before any successor is even considered, a firm contract concerning the county's support, this time with a specific dollar amount, must be worked out. Moreover, Mr. Maguire adds, "It's going to be important for the board to commit to specific amounts of endowment for acquisitions and operating costs."
He did not say where the millions upon millions of dollars for an endowment adequate to help safeguard the biggest museum in Los Angeles will come from.

HEADLINE: Old Tablet From Turkish Site Shows Early Spread of Culture

BYLINE: By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD

 BODY:
NEW discoveries in Turkey and northern Syria, two buried cities and intriguing clay tablets with cuneiform writing, are expanding the known horizons of early urban civilization and literacy well beyond the Sumerian city-states of southern Mesopotamia.
Archeologists say the discoveries are among the most exciting in Mesopotamian studies in recent decades. They are confident that further excavations at the sites will provide answers to one of the most important questions in archeology: how and when did the phenomena of urban living and the first writing spread from their place of origin more than 5,000 years ago in the lower valley of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers far into adjacent regions? 
 Working in the Balikh River valley of southern Turkey, near the Syrian border, a team of American and Turkish archeologists found traces of a large city that apparently flourished in 2600 B.C. A single tablet with cuneiform inscriptions, the earliest known writing system, was found lying on the surface, prompting hopeful speculation that other, more revealing tablets would eventually be uncovered.
Dr. Patricia Wattenmaker, an archeologist at the University of Virginia and director of the excavations, said the discovery should overturn conventional thinking that confined the development of large urban centers of the period to southern Mesopotamia and dismissed the cultures to the north and west as mere backwaters. Further research, she said, could extend the known range of early literacy.
Preliminary excavations indicate that the site, known as Kazane Hoyuk, holds the remains of a city that spread over at least 250 acres, large for its time and place. One tentative hypothesis is that these are the ruins of Urshu, a northern city mentioned in some Sumerian texts.
"Kazane's a huge place," said Dr. Glenn Schwartz, an archeologist at Johns Hopkins University who is familiar with the discovery, "and has to have been one of the most important political and economic centers of its region."
The other discovery that has excited archeologists is the buried ruins of a smaller city of the third millennium B.C. at Tell Beidar in northern Syria. There European and Syrian archeologists have found a well-preserved temple, administrative buildings and a collection of as many as 70 clay tablets with Sumerian writing and Semitic names, as well as many other tablet fragments. And they have only begun to dig.
"It's the most spectacular find this year in Syria," said Dr. Marc Lebeau, the leader of the discovery team, who is president of the European Center for Upper Mesopotamian Studies in Brussels.
 
Dating of Tablets
 Preliminary analysis places the time of the tablets and other artifacts at about 2400 B.C., during the Sumerian ascendancy in southern Mesopotamia and just before the rise of the Akkadian empire under Sargon the Great. The tablets that have been deciphered appear to be bureaucratic records of a robust economy, including lists of donkeys, oxen and sheep and the names of towns and villages.
Dr. Harvey Weiss, a Yale University archeologist, recently visited Tell Beidar and said that it and Kazane Hoyuk "prove everything we've been saying about northern Mesopotamia for many years," namely that the cuneiform archive discovered in 1974 at Ebla, also in Syria, was not an anomaly but strong evidence of the widespread expansion of Sumerian urban civilization, beginning as early as 2600 B.C.
If Ebla, near the city of Aleppo, revealed the civilization's western progression, excavations by Dr. Weiss at Tell Leilan, begun in 1979, produced the first strong evidence of its northern reach. Tell Leilan, identified as the ancient walled city of Shubat Enlil that experienced sudden growth in 2500, lies on the fertile plains of Syria near the borders of Turkey and Iraq. Nearby is the European dig site of Tell Beidar. Farther north is Kazane Hoyuk, at least twice as large as Tell Beidar and the same size as Tell Leilan or larger.
Other scholars had previously failed to recognize this expansion phenomenon mainly because the most thorough excavations had until recently been confined to the Sumerian heartland in the lower Tigris and Euphrates valley.
 
New View of Mesopotamia
 "People used to think of ancient Mesopotamia as small and restricted, but not any longer," said Dr. Elizabeth Stone, an archeologist at the State University of New York at Stony Brook.
The two discoveries were made over the last two summers, but the results have only now become known by word of mouth (and computer mail) to many other archeologists. The details and their implications were discussed in interviews last week.
Dr. Wattenmaker was driving on the road south of the modern Turkish city of Urfa when she saw a prominent mound in the fields near an irrigation canal. In her initial survey last year, pottery shards were found scattered over the ground. Some were as much as 7,000 years old. Others were at least 4,500 years old and in the Sumerian style.
This and other evidence gathered this year indicated that the site had been occupied almost continuously since 5000 B.C., and so should provide evidence of the transition from a simple farming society to an urban culture. It grew to be a large city about 2600 B.C. and was abandoned for an unknown reason around 1800 B.C.
A worker found the baked clay tablet lying on the surface. It is 22 inches by 22, and encrusted in dirt. Cleaning away some of the dirt, archeologists saw the wedge-shaped cuneiform inscriptions typical of early writing, which was first developed by Mesopotamians about 5,000 years ago.
Scholars are especially cautious in their assessment of the tablet because it was a "stray find." It was picked up on the ground, out of context with archeological ruins and in an area that had been disturbed by construction of the canal. Still, they said it appeared to be genuine and from the third millennium B.C.
"It's a tease," said Dr. Piotr Michalowski, a specialist in Sumerian and Babylonian languages at the University of Michigan, who is examining photographs of the tablet inscriptions. "It doesn't tell you much. It is not a connected narrative of any sort, just signs and not very good ones. Somebody might have been practicing writing, and wasn't good at it."
 
Speculation of Literacy
 Since early writing was associated with official record-keeping related to the collection and distribution of grain and goods and since Kazane Hoyuk was a city on known trade routes, Dr. Michalowski said: "I will stick my neck out and say it had to be a literate society. Other tablets may be found there. I've always thought Ebla was only a symptom of a much more widespread literacy in this period."
Although archeologists said they could not yet determine the ancient name of this city, Dr. Michalowski said there was a "good degree of probability" that it was Urshu, which Sumerian inscriptions of 2100 B.C. refer to as a city in the highlands of Ebla; that would put it at some distance to the northwest. The site of Urshu has never been identified. But confirmation of this surmise will have to await the discovery of more and better tablets.
Dr. Wattenmaker plans more excavations, looking for tablets and other evidence regarding the nature of economic and social forces that contributed to the rise of centralized government and urban society. Her research team included archeologists from the Universities of Chicago and Virginia, Istanbul University and the Urfa Museum.
Preliminary study of the tablets at Tell Beidar, Dr. Lebeau said, showed that they are approximately the same age as the Ebla archive, probably a century or two later than the Kazane Hoyuk fluorescence, and that they provide a clear link between this ancient city, Ebla in the west and southern Mesopotamia.
These are the first tablets of this period to be found in northern Syria, and archeologists expect to find more as they dig deeper at the site. The discovery team included archeologists from Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain and Syria.
The new discoveries, Dr. Weiss said, were further evidence for the sudden rise beginning around 2600 B. C. of cities in nearly all directions beyond the bounds of southern Mesopotamia and may help account for this expansion. Was this the consequence of trade among independent people or incipient colonialism and imperialism? If these burning questions in Mesopotamian archeology can be answered, scholars will still be left to ponder the bigger question of how state societies and urban civilization happened to begin then and there in the first place.

HEADLINE: MARATHON;
Lebow's Mettle Earns French Medal

BYLINE: By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
Countdown week for next Sunday's New York City Marathon got under way at Tavern on the Green in Central Park yesterday with the usual tokens of hype and of hoopla, from the over-sized athletic shoe behind the podium at the morning news conference to the presentation of the official medal of the French City of Caen to Fred Lebow.
You know Fred Lebow. According to Caen's deputy mayor, Paul Dubourget, everybody in France does. And what's more, the French are so taken with Lebow's sheer, shining human will in overcoming brain cancer and completing his 69th marathon last year that they plan to honor him from here to France. 
 Among other things, Lebow, who is reverting from runner to race director this year, will receive the French Order of Merit. He will also run in a 14-kilometer race that is a satellite to the annual Liberty Marathon, run along the invasion beaches of Normandy to the World War II Memorial museum in Caen.
The 1994 races, on June 12, will be special, partly because they will be held in connection with the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Normandy invasion on June 6, and partly because the shorter race, formerly known as the Pegasus, after the bridge at its starting point that was the first French territory to be liberated on D-Day (by British glider troops at 16 minutes past midnight) will be renamed the Fred Lebow Challenge.
"I've run in more than 1,000 races," Lebow said, "but never in one named for me."
 
 
Hot or Cold?
 The fact that the Nov. 14 race date is the latest in the New York City Marathon's history has stirred a debate between Lebow and Allan Steinfeld, the technical director. Because this past Sunday was very cold, Lebow expects frigid weather. For the very same reason, Steinfeld expects a warm day. The National Weather Service, citing a southeastern storm that was knocking all the models out of whack, said yesterday that it was a coin flip. For the record, the normal high for the date is 55 degrees, the low is 42, and if you want to prepare for the worst, the records were 71 in 1980 and 20 in 1905. There were also 2.23 inches of rain in 1972 and one inch of snow in 1911. Mush.
 
Helping Hands, and Feet
 He's said it before, but this time Fred Lebow means it. Really. The number of starters, which has been growing alarmingly, to a course-choking 28,656 last year, will be held down to 26,000 or so.
The runners will also be held back to prevent the premature starts that have marred a couple of previous races. For one thing, because construction at the Pulaski Bridge has required routing the course over longer lanes, the three starting lines will be moved up a compensating 40 yards or so, which means the main blue men's starting line will be narrowed considerably, making crowd control easier.
To make it easier still, the volunteer monitors who were required to move out of the way of the impatient, surging throng a minute or so before the starting canon will be replaced by 200 runners from the police and fire departments. As official competitors, they will be able to keep their front-row positions until the start. They will be given special hats, but will have to supply their own billy clubs.
 
More Sponsors Than Miles
 As befitting an enterprise that has an estimated $80 million impact on the local economy, Marathon Inc. is big business. The front pocket of the 116-page press manual's loose-leaf binder is stuffed with individual releases from seven major and 11 "sporting" sponsors. (The 10 "associate" sponsors get only listings.)
You probably knew that Mercedes is the official marathon car, that Ronzoni is the official marathon pasta, and maybe even that the Rudins are the official marathon family. But did you know that Blimpie is the official marathon sandwich, that Arnoff is the official marathon mover and that Browning-Ferris is the official marathon recycler -- primarily of the 2 million or so cups and 150,000 plastic bottles expected to be discarded by runners using Vermont Pure Natural Spring Water, the official marathon water, and Gatorade, the official marathon sports water.
 
Better Than the Stanley Cup!
 With a roster of such former runners as Bobby Murcer, Jean-Claude Killy, Ingemar Johansson and Floyd Patterson, the New York City Marathon has long attracted cross-over celebrity athletes.
This year's entries include Lynn Swann, the 41-year-old former Steeler receiver, who will make his marathon debut, and Bobby Nystrom, the 41-year-old former Islander forward, who will be making his second run, after finishing in 3 hours 40 minutes in 1991.
Whatever his time this year, Nystrom would seem fairly sold on the marathon. Or, as the man who helped the Islanders win four Stanley Cups, and scored the overtime goal which won the first one, put it yesterday, "Finishing the marathon was probably the most thrilling experience of my life."

HEADLINE: Editorial Notebook: Nationalist China or Nationalist Taiwan?;
Democracy Raises An Inconvenient Issue

BYLINE: By DAVID C. UNGER

 BODY:
Americans who still think of Taiwan as "Nationalist China" are in for a shock. The most conspicuous nationalism to be encountered on the island these days is not Chinese but Taiwanese.
It's based on the idea that the immigrants who arrived from the Chinese mainland centuries ago created a new and distinctive society, just as the English colonists who settled America or Australia did. Taiwanese nationalists point out that for only four years this century has their island been under mainland rule. 
 Taiwanese nationalists distinguish themselves from "mainlanders" -- the families of those who fled mainland China with Chiang Kai-shek after he lost the civil war there in 1949. Using that definition, about 85 percent of the island's present inhabitants are Taiwanese. But even most of today's "mainlanders" are Taiwan-born children of mainland parents.
Taiwanese nationalism isn't just a cultural curiosity. In the five years since President Lee Teng-hui, himself a Taiwanese, began dismantling Chiang Kai-shek's police state, Taiwanese politics has increasingly come to reflect public opinion. Taiwanese nationalism now finds powerful political expression in the call to abandon also Chiang's claim to be the lawful government of China, and to declare, instead, an independent Republic of Taiwan.
Independence is the official rallying cry of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party. And it even has some sympathizers within the ruling Chinese Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang. Already, Taipei has begun to press for its own United Nations seat.
There's a real chance, then, that a pro-independence government could take power in Taipei this decade. If saner heads prevail on both sides of the Taiwan Straits, this needn't necessarily lead to crisis. But because Beijing openly threatens to greet any moves toward Taiwan independence with military force, the issue could bring on a large-scale regional confrontation.
Most Asian Pacific nations, the U.S. included, would prefer not even to think about such a dangerous possibility. Understandably, they give priority to their relations with mainland China, a country with many more people, regional military power and an expanding marketplace.
Taiwan is no superpower. But its 22 million people, dynamic capital-exporting economy and increasingly vibrant democracy make it impossible for Americans or Asians to be indifferent to its fate.
The sensible course is to begin diplomatic efforts now to pre-empt any future military confrontation. That involves working out broadly acceptable formulas to reinforce Taiwan's present political and economic autonomy and to include Taiwan in the regional economic and security organizations now taking shape.
For Washington, it always seems to be the wrong moment to raise new contentions into an already troubled relationship with Beijing. But waiting for the right moment poses even more serious risks.
At President Clinton's invitation, Taiwan and Beijing will both be represented at this month's Asia Pacific economic summit meetings in Seattle. That makes it a fitting occasion to begin thinking and talking with regional leaders about an issue that isn't going to go away. DAVID C. UNGER

HEADLINE: The 'Great Debate' Over Nafta

 BODY:
Were it not for the fact that truly serious issues are involved, the caterwauling over the North American Free Trade Agreement would be almost comic.
On one side we have a populist President frantically wooing the Republican establishment to round up the 30 or so votes he needs to get Nafta through the House. Standing the usual political coalitions on their heads, Mr. Clinton has courted familiar G.O.P. luminaries like Henry Kissinger, James Baker and even Senator Bob Dole, while accusing his erstwhile allies in the labor movement of using "naked pressure" and "muscle-bound tactics" to defeat the agreement. 
 On the other side we have Ross Perot, warning that Nafta is a giant plot against the American worker and delighting in the chance to tweak the big boys and rebuild his slightly tattered reputation as the People's Tribune.
To top it all off, Nafta, a complex issue of no small consequence to millions of Americans, Canadians and Mexicans, will be "debated" tonight on the Larry King show, a forum better suited to the sound-bite demagoguery of which Mr. Perot is an acknowledged master than to the deadpan analysis preferred by his opponent, Vice President Al Gore.
Nafta deserves better. The laboriously constructed agreement to phase out trade barriers among the U.S., Mexico and Canada, which this page has strongly supported, is likely to have a positive, though small, impact on U.S. living standards and provide a modest boost to the Mexican economy. Some American jobs would be lost to cheaper Mexican labor, other jobs would be gained because American exports would increase as Mexico's high tariffs gradually disappeared.
Economics aside, Nafta's defeat would suggest that the U.S. had abandoned its historical commitment to free trade and would thus discourage other Latin and South American countries that (as Washington has long suggested) have moved toward more market-oriented economies in the expectation of freer world trade.
Mr. Perot dismisses the foreign policy implications while manhandling the economic data. In a nine-month anti-Nafta crusade that has taken him to 43 states and 91 cities, he has warned that Nafta would cause American industry and agriculture to flee south with "a giant sucking sound" toward cheaper Mexican labor, costing Americans 5.9 million jobs.
This is an absurd calculation that Mr. Perot, made giddy perhaps by his resurgent notoriety, has now taken to truly stratospheric levels of exaggeration. On Sunday in Tampa, he told a cheering, stomping audience that 85 million people could lose their jobs under Nafta, which is just about everyone in the American work force. "Eighty-five million people can elect anybody -- anybody!" he cried. "Do you hear that, White House?"
There's no telling how Al Gore will handle this sort of hyperbole. Ed Rollins, a Republican consultant who worked for Mr. Perot's Presidential campaign before quitting in disgust, predicts that Mr. Perot will "chew up Al Gore and spit him out. Gore will give intellectual answers, and Perot will hit the emotional buttons and spit out sound bites."
However, this overlooks the fact that Ross Perot hasn't really debated anyone on the issue; his recent anti-Nafta campaign has consisted almost entirely of monologues with adoring audiences. And while Mr. Gore certainly cannot match the Texas bantamweight sound bite for sound bite, his grasp of dull detail may be just what the Nafta discussion needs.
Nothing will quiet Mr. Perot's incessant chatter. But a sober presentation of something resembling the truth about Nafta might persuade Larry King's audience, including Congress, to think again about Mr. Perot's distortions.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Grovel and Pander

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
Ross Perot? He is a team player and yes, he might be considered for a job in Bill Clinton's cabinet.
Who said that? Al Gore, when he was running for Vice President. 
 Ross Perot? He is a man of such standing and dignity and so full of ideas that a great flock of Americans lifts off simultaneously from all over the country, flying to Dallas. They crowd the platform around him, to praise him before the nation and ask for his approval.
Who did that? Why, the country's top Democrats and Republicans -- members of Congress, financiers, large thinkers. And who told them to do it? Bill Clinton, George Bush and their political handlers, a month before Election Day in 1992.
They said it, they did it, and they made embarrassments of themselves. That is their business, I suppose. But what the Democrats and Republicans also accomplished in the great grovel of 1992 is the business of the country. They accomplished the empowerment of Ross Perot.
Instead of fighting him, telling Americans what they really thought of him, that he was a demagogue, a political hustler, a chronic quitter, making suckers of voters in the snake-oil school of American politics, whacko but not funny, they just groveled, pandered and simpered.
The motive was to win over some Perot followers, maybe even get a pat on the head from the leader. The result was they helped him parlay his wealth into 19 percent of the national vote, plus four years front and center to try for more percentage points, a whole White House more.
Now Mr. Clinton, less than a year into his first term, finds that Ross as Boss already endangers Nafta, a keystone endeavor of his Administration. And look -- he is likely to endanger other cherished goals in the three years to come, including a second term.
We will not say we told you so, will we? No, we will just count our few little blessings and give thanks that win or lose, Nafta is paying off in the decision to confront Mr. Perot.
Supporters of Nafta should hope that Mr. Gore is better than Mr. Clinton in spelling out what he is for and against. The Vice President will be for, I assume, a treaty that he thinks can bring a better economic day to the United States, Mexico and Canada. He is against H. Ross Perot, and has come to the conclusion that he is not a team player after all.
But I hope he does not turn his support for Nafta into a blunderbuss attack on Americans who exercise their constitutional right to be afraid for their jobs, correctly or not, and have the nerve to say so.
On "Meet the Press" Mr. Clinton decided that the A.F.L.-C.I.O. was behaving "real roughshod" for doing what all big lobbies do -- lobby, real roughshod.
I do not like unions threatening to defeat Representative Nancy Pelosi because she supports Nafta. She is a Democrat who is one of the best reasons for moving to San Francisco despite the weather. But I like even less the threats of other lobbies -- like the gun lobby campaigning against Congressional dissidents. Guns kill, not union cards.
The Administration has failed to convince labor after it had a full chance to do so. Denouncing American labor now will simply help Mr. Perot -- one more time.
In any case, facing Mr. Perot instead of groveling is good for the posture and the soul. So far Republican leadership seems still in careful crouch. Senator Robert Dole thinks confronting Mr. Perot in a Nafta debate could build him up more. Quite possible; there is no free pander.
The Dole argument was raised whenever politicians talked of standing straight before Mr. Perot and talking straight -- and always will be.
Will the new upright position last right through the 1996 campaign, even if Mr. Perot looks strong as primary, convention and voting time get sweatily near? Will Democrats and Republicans keep telling the American people that a demagogue is a demagogue -- and a danger to American political life?
Let's not be cynics, no. But the year of grovel, pander and simper did leave, say, certain shadows about the courage and wisdom of both major political parties.
Yet certainly it can be said that the Clinton decision to send Mr. Gore against Mr. Perot should make it hard to pick up the great grovel where it left off. Can't that be said?

HEADLINE: What Other Industry Suits Washington?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
In "Tax Fairness for D.C." (editorial, Oct. 30), you are right to criticize Congressional meddling with the budget of the District of Columbia. The residents of the District should have the real self-government that cannot exist without fiscal autonomy, including the right to make foolish decisions. 
 But you are dead wrong in asserting that "the Government presence costs the District $2 billion a year in lost tax revenues."
If that statement means anything at all, it must mean that if the Federal capital were moved from Washington, the Government uses of the land that it now occupies in the District would be replaced by private business activities and fully taxpaying housing.
That is a fantasy: in a few years, Washington would be a lot worse off than Detroit is, with its economic reason for being -- its role as the Federal capital -- gone. What would replace that? Steel mills? Oil wells? Theme parks? Shopping malls?
Washington is a city of stable, largely middle-class jobs because it is the capital. There is no earthly reason why the rest of us should pay higher Federal taxes in the form of "rent" on land and buildings we own and have paid for in the past so that District residents can pay lower local taxes.

HEADLINE: Small Businesses Also Deserve a Few Breaks From City Hall

 BODY:

To the Editor:
New York City is giving Kidder, Peabody & Company $31 million in incentives to stay in New York City (news article, Oct. 30). The city has been giving large corporations billions for decades to retain jobs. 
 But such incentives are not available to companies like mine, which have decided to stick it out though most of our competitors have abandoned this city. Indeed, by not making demands on City Hall, we pay higher taxes to subsidize those who have the leverage to hold the city hostage. Yet small companies are collectively the major employers in the city.
It costs us about double to operate in Brooklyn what it would in New Jersey. However, we are not compensated proportionately to make up the difference. Much of our work is with government. But many agencies in government limit the overhead rate a participating company can charge to about 60 percent of what it costs us to operate in Brooklyn.
We own the building in which we have three floors of offices. But we are not permitted to include in our overhead the market rate for the space that we use for offices, only the cost of depreciating and maintaining the building, which is less than one-third of the rent that we could charge others for the same space.
Kidder, Peabody claims the $31 million in incentives will enable it "to operate in Manhattan on a cost-competitive basis." What about companies like ours? Many "New York" companies face this issue with most of their work force outside the city.
Small-business owners get involved in their communities. Each year my company provides hundreds of thousands of dollars in pro-bono technical services. We plan to continue to do so as long as we live and work in New York City.
City Hall must protect the small-business people who contribute to the city's coffers and its welfare as much as those that are more politically visible.

HEADLINE: Theater in Review

BYLINE: By WILBORN HAMPTON

 BODY:

Trophies
Cherry Lane Theater
38 Commerce Street
Greenwich Village
 
By John J. Wooten; directed by John Gulley; set by Mark Cheney; costumes by Missy West; lighting by Mark F. O'Connor; sound by Scott Stauffer; music by David Brunetti; production stage manager, Geoffrey F. Morris. Presented by Yabadoo Productions.
WITH: Janet Nell Catt, John Henry Cox, R. Ward Duffy, Mark Irish and Christen Tassin. 
 As the lights come up on "Trophies," John J. Wooten's gripping new play at the Cherry Lane Theater, a television is on in an empty den that is a shrine to the modern American family. Appropriately, the show no one is watching is "Family Feud."
But the cozy fireplace, wingback chair, bay window and trophy case that make up this vision of homey contentment is merely a facade behind which the repressed anger and thwarted aspirations of the American dream roil. Mr. Wooten has attempted nothing less than an All-American family tragedy, a play about ordinary people in ordinary conflict that ends as a poignant lament for the lost familial values we like to think once held our society together.
The play evolves around an Easter visit home from college by David, the eldest of three children in the Stone family. It is clear from the start that if David's decision to major in acting has made him a prodigal, his return is not awaited with open arms. His father is coolly polite, his mother uneasy, and Laura, his kid sister, indifferent. Only his younger brother, Bobby, is eager to see him, and it is soon apparent that all is not well with Bobby.
Through flashbacks, Mr. Wooten relates how Bobby, the father's pride and joy, was a high school football star when an accident left him brain damaged. As a result, the father has retreated to a Scotch bottle, sliding toward alcoholism in his wingback chair, refusing to answer the phone or even watch football on television. Laura spends as much time away from home as allowed, Bobby stays mostly in his room, and Mrs. Stone fights a losing battle at maintaining equilibrium.
David's infrequent visits shatter whatever balance keeps the family afloat. His very presence seems antagonistic to his father, and while their arguments may turn on such subjects as David's choice of career, each knows their antipathy springs from a deeper source. To see "Trophies" as a play about football vs. acting would be like describing "Death of a Salesman" as a play about unemployment.
Father and son cling to rage and resentment, while the mother shuttles between the two trying to arrange a cease-fire that will at least hold through the weekend. Mr. Wooten offers no solutions or remedies, only the hope of a kind of liberation that comes through honesty, however painful. There are moments that brush close to sentimentality, and some of the early scenes tend to portray David and Mr. Stone in black and white. But those images blur as father and son move toward acceptance of their failure toward each other.
The director, John Gulley, has assembled a fine cast that keeps the action taut and the tension high, even in the humor. R. Ward Duffy is excellent as David, a resilient and ebullient young man who ultimately comes to realize his own selfishness. John Henry Cox delivers a tightly reined performance as the father, clutching his glass of whisky for dear life while coming to acknowledge his own truth. Janet Nell Catt is touching as Mrs. Stone and Mark Irish is credible and sympathetic as Bobby. Mark Cheney's set could have come from an Ethan Allen showroom. WILBORN HAMPTON

HEADLINE: In Central Asia, New Alliances Shift the Balance;
Turkey Looks to West

 BODY:

To the Editor:
William Safire's "Ally for Sale" (column, Oct. 28) lacks understanding of Turkey's deep commitment to the Western alliance, of which Turkey is an integral part. Since World War II, Turkey has promoted and strengthened its alliance with the West out of respect for shared ideals of freedom, democracy, human rights and economic liberalization. 
 Turkey stood by the United States and other coalition partners during the Persian Gulf war and its aftermath. Turkey has no intention of weakening its position over the situation in Iraq. However, the economic embargo of Iraq has cost Turkey a total of $20 billion in the last four years. This has had adverse effects especially in the southeast region of Turkey. It is difficult to understand Mr. Safire's contention that Turkey must go on suffering.
As for the Kurds, there is a distinction between the P.K.K., the Marxist-Leninist terrorist organization, and Turkish citizens of various ethnic origins. P.K.K.'s terrorism is determined to pursue its own destructive separatist aims. Turkey is determined to protect its territorial integrity and sovereignty.
Turkish citizens of Kurdish or other ethnic origins enjoy equal rights within Turkey's democratic society. Turkey has also shown concern for Iraqi Kurds. In 1988 Turkey accepted more than 60,000 Kurds running from brutality. We have recently given $13 million of humanitarian aid to the Kurds and others in northern Iraq.
Turkey's relations with the United States will grow. I quote President Clinton, who in meeting with Prime Minister Tansu Ciller remarked:
"We've all had to pay a price for enforcing the will of the international community, and Turkey in that regard has certainly done more than its share. And we are grateful for its contribution."

HEADLINE: Trade Pact Divides New York's Garment Industry

BYLINE: By KEN BROWN

 BODY:
Behind the facades along the streets of New York's storied garment district, it would seem that few workers or managers appear as vulnerable to the potential upheaval caused by opening trade with Mexico as those in the apparel business. Over the years it has lost tens of thousands of jobs to foreign countries where lower wages and business costs seem the perfect setting for churning out competitively priced shirts, jackets, pants and blouses.
But the industry is split over the North American Free Trade Agreement. Some prominent New York manufacturers support it and are convinced that they have little to fear from Mexico's lower-wage work force. In fact, they think New York's battered economy may actually benefit if Congress approves the trade pact, which will reduce tariffs among the United States, Mexico and Canada. However, other manufacturers -- and the industry's unions -- believe that the prospect of increased Mexican competition is unfair and may ultimately mean their demise. 
 "What makes anybody think that sending my work to another country is going to help my shop?" asked Dino Bonacasa, president of Dino Clothing Company on West 19th Street in Manhattan. He said foreign competition in Asia and Mexico had already forced him to cut his work force by nearly 60 percent, to about 75 people, and he feared an influx of cheap goods from Mexico would eventually force him to shut down.
 
 
A Typical Shop
 Mr. Bonacasa's shop -- where the unionized workers speak a range of languages from Italian and Spanish to Hungarian and Romanian -- produces high-quality men's suits and sport jackets. It is typical of many companies that are too small to move and yet would face pressure from low-wage manufacturers in Mexico. The brightly lit shop extends the length of a city block, and workers, members of the Amalgamated Clothing and Textiles Workers Union, earn between $8 and $10 an hour.
"They don't pay my gas, my electricity, my labor, my insurance,"Mr. Bonacasa said of Mexican manufacturers. "How can I produce at the same price?"
Other garment makers concede that costs in Mexico would be less but they disagree that would automatically spell doom for manufacturers in New York's garment district, which runs from Chinatown in southern Manhattan to around 40th Street in midtown. They argue that clothing can be made profitably in New York even if wages here are relatively high -- mostly because New York manufacturers benefit from their proximity to fashion designers who demand fast turnaround times for making a trendy design come to life on a rack.
Those in favor of the agreement believe that the expensive suits and jackets Mr. Bonacasa's company makes will survive and that horror stories of shuttered shops could undermine the trade pact's passage. They say the accord will help the city's staggering economy, which has lost nearly 400,000 jobs since April 1989.
"Our manufacturing base is not going to be seriously affected." said Mitchell Moss, director of the New York Urban Research Center and a professor at New York University. "The ones that survived in New York have been able to adapt to the environment and find specialized niches, and find noneconomic reasons for being in New York."
"We don't make the stuff that's carried in Wal-Mart, we make the stuff that's carried in Barneys," Mr. Moss said, referring to the more intricate sewing and tailoring that is required of higher-cost suits, jackets and designer fashions made in the garment district.
Bud Konheim, the chief executive of Nicole Miller Ltd., agrees, and says New York's speed and quality cannot be matched anywhere for any price.
"We are 100 percent in favor of the Nafta agreement, and we are a union shop and we make all our clothing in New York," he said. "We have no plans to manufacture in Mexico and we never will; we were the first ones to manufacture in Hong Kong, and the first ones to leave Hong Kong."
Mr. Konheim said those who moved to Mexico for the low wages would quickly see any initial savings disappear as skilled workers demanded more money and problems that could have been solved quickly at home became intractable abroad.
"Our solution was making all our product two blocks from our office," Mr. Konheim said. "We can run down there in one minute to see if there's something wrong, and we solve it right away."
Still Mr. Konheim is in the minority. Eli Elias, the president and executive director of the New York Skirt and Sportswear Association predicted a depression for the city if the trade accord passed.
 
 
'Almighty Buck'
 "The almighty buck is the thing that is going to control people's thinking," he said, adding that garment workers who lose their jobs here would have nowhere else to go.
And Paul Lau, general manager of the Greater Blouse, Skirt and Undergarment Association, which represents 540 mainly Chinese-owned shops in the metropolitan area, agrees. "My gut feeling is there will be a significant shift of jobs, and that would clearly affect our workers," he said.
New York's garment industry has been shrinking for the last 30 years, first as companies moved to nonunion factories in the South, and then to Asia. Employment in the industry is about 83,000, making it the largest manufacturing industry in the city, even though it is the 11th-largest industry in the city over all, down from No. 2 in 1960.
Most of the companies that did leave produced on the low end of the industry -- underwear and casual clothes -- that did not require the skill and knowledge necessary for suits. But some still remain, particularly in the fast-moving area of sportswear, where styles last for days and weeks instead of months and years.
 
 
Trucker's Day Away
 Shraga Frisch, the owner of Royal Sportswear Manufacturers, said his only advantage over Asian companies had been response time -- he needs just two months lead time to produce a garment, compared with six months in Asia.
"But Mexico is just a trucker's day away," he said.
He is opposed to the North American pact. "I think the whole industry would be closed," said Mr. Frisch, himself a Brazilian immigrant. "Even the factories in the South. Historically, their lead over other manufacturers is low overhead; they're going to lose that, too."
Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the regional commissioner for the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, said the accord must be viewed as part of the overall shift in the world economy. "It tightens the screw a notch, but the screw has been tightening without it," he said.
This point is stressed by those favoring the accord, who say that claims of job losses must be accompanied by proof that the pact is the culprit. Susan Kaufman Purcell, vice president of the Americas Society, an educational and cultural institute based in New York, said many of the jobs lost would be replaced by better jobs in industries that would benefit from the agreement.
 
 
'Life and Death Issue'
 Many of those jobs will be nonunion though, so the two garment industry unions -- the International Ladies Garment Workers Union and the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union -- will be hurt.
"This is a life-and-death issue for the labor movement in this country and in this city," said Alan H. Howard, assistant to the president of the Ladies Garment Workers Union. Union officials say the pact will lead to lower wages in shops that do not move.
Dorcia M. Robinson, who sews sleeves for Dino's and has been in the trade for 35 years, said, "I don't mind helping anyone else, but you've got to help yourself." She reflects the prevailing attitude of the workers who sew and press the garments made in New York.
"I'm almost 65 and I can retire," she added. "I feel for the people behind me. And some people, this is all they know."

Fresenius USA said that the increase in net income for the latest quarter and 9 months resulted from an increase in net sales, as well as certain economies of scale which the company was able to achieve as a result of increased production volumes.
 
In addition, the company said it received additional revenues of about $ 3.5 million from bloodline sales during the latest quarter. The increased sales resulted from actions taken by the Food & Drug Administration, which temporarily banned the importation of bloodlines by one of the company's competitors.

HEADLINE: THE FREE TRADE ACCORD: The Overview;
Gore and Perot Dual on TV Over the Trade Pact

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 9

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore suggested tonight that Ross Perot opposed the North American Free Trade Agreement to win political and financial advantage for himself.
In a sour 90-minute televised debate that turned more on personality than substance, the Vice President observed that Mr. Perot had favored the trade agreement until he began running for President, and that the Perot family had obtained special free-trade privileges for its development near a cargo airport in Fort Worth. 
 "If it's good enough for him," Mr. Gore declared, gesturing at Mr. Perot, "why not the rest of the country?"
 
For Free Trade
 Mr. Perot retorted that he was in favor of free trade generally, but not the agreement negotiated by the Bush Administration and strongly advocated by President Clinton. As for the airport development, Mr. Perot said he would never put his financial interests ahead of the country's.
The debate, broadcast on the CNN program "Larry King Live," broke no new ground on the merits and demerits of the trade pact, devolving instead into bickering and recriminations.
Indeed, Mr. Gore seemed intent on trying to attack Mr. Perot and provoke him, departing from the more polite treatment Gov. Bill Clinton and President George Bush gave the Texan in the 1992 Presidential debates.
 
Scrambling for Votes
 The House of Representatives is scheduled to vote next Wednesday on legislation to put the trade accord into effect. As matters stand now, Mr. Clinton is scrambling for enough votes to win passage of the measure. Politically, it is the most important vote facing Mr. Clinton and Congress for the rest of the year.
The White House challenged Mr. Perot to the debate in an effort to make him the embodiment of opposition to the measure. Polls show that his standing with the public has fallen markedly in the last six months.
The trade pact would gradually eliminate tariffs and trade barriers between the United States, Mexico and Canada. It has the support of many business organizations but is vigorously opposed by organized labor.
 
Sarcasm Aplenty
 From the moment the genial Mr. King introduced his guests and announced the rules, the confrontation turned sarcastic. Mr. Gore repeatedly interrupted Mr. Perot, challenging his presentation and suggesting that the Texan was more interested in promoting his political ambitions than finding the truth.
Mr. Perot, affecting a kindly schoolteacher's forbearance for the class dunce, instructed Mr. Gore to be quiet and stop interrupting him.
At the outset, Mr. Gore said of the agreement, "This is a good deal for your country."
Mr. Perot, who won 19 percent of the popular vote running as an independent in last year's Presidential election, responded: "This is not good for the people of either country," referring to the United States and Mexico.
Mr. Gore argued that every living former President, former Secretary of State, Treasury and Defense and every economist who had won the Nobel Prize favored the trade measure. Mr. Perot replied that they were the ones who had caused the country's economic problems in the first place. "Those are the guys that cut the worst trade deals in history," he said.
 
Standards of Living
 Lower tariffs in Mexico in the last five years had already led to 400,000 additional jobs in the United States in exporting industries, and the trade measure would create another 200,000 in the next few years, Mr. Gore said.
Mr. Perot disputed that. The Mexicans, he said, simply could not afford American goods. "Here it is on a more personal basis," he asserted. "Livestock in this country and animals have a better life than good, decent, hard-working Mexicans."
Mr. Gore and Mr. Perot arrived not only with charts and photographs but with set arguments. They involved much more than just the advantages and drawbacks of the trade accord.
Mr. Gore's contention that the Perot family's airport project in Fort Worth would benefit from rejection of the trade pact is a questionable one. The family has said for years that the project, run by Mr. Perot's son, Ross Jr., would benefit from free trade.
In response to the accusation tonight, Mr. Perot declared: "This is the lowest, silliest propaganda trick put out by the U.S. Government. My son's too good to be true. I will not tolerate anyone criticizing him."
Mr. Perot parried another of Mr. Gore's jabs -- the contention that he had lobbied Congress to win special tax breaks for his businesses. That was widely documented in the 1970's, but Mr. Gore did not seem to have the details. He was unable to respond when Mr. Perot called him a liar.
 
Gain or Loss on Jobs?
 The two men disagreed emphatically on the pact's effect on the job market. Mr. Gore argued that free trade would improve the economy of all North America and would create a common market larger than any other in the world. More exports would lead to more jobs in the United States, he said.
Mr. Perot maintained that hundreds of thousands of low-wage, low-skill jobs would move from the United States to Mexico as companies relocated in search of cheaper labor, less Government regulation and lax environmental rules.
Mr. Gore said that was preposterous. "If low wages were the determinant of where we locate business," he maintained, "then Haiti would be an economic powerhouse. Bangladesh would be a powerhouse."
American workers are the most productive in the world, the Vice President said, and as long as that is the case, American companies will be able to manufacture most goods here less expensively.
Mr. Gore maintained that 22 of 23 studies of the economic effect of the trade measure showed that it would lead to an increase of jobs in the United States.
Mr. Perot said Government studies were worthless. "I'm saying they basically come out with phony numbers," he said.
Mr. Gore said Mr. Perot had often been a doomsayer only to be proven wrong. The Texan had predicted, Mr. Gore said, that 40,000 American soldiers would die in the Persian Gulf war.
"You were wrong about that," Mr. Gore said. "Now, the politics of negativism and fear only go so far."
 
Spending on Lobbying
 The two men fussed time and again over who was spending how much money to lobby for and against the trade pact.
Mr. Perot said that the Government of Mexico had spent $30 million lobbying on the measure and that the full faith and credit of the United States was behind the Clinton drive to win approval of the measure.
The Vice President noted that all those expenditures were on the public record, then challenged Mr. Perot to say how much he was spending in the effort to defeat the pact. Mr. Perot hedged.
"I am paying for it," he said. "It's that simple."
 
Mexican Politics
 Mr. Perot criticized Mexico for its oligarchic, one-party rule. "Read the State Department's annual report on human rights," he said, "of journalists being killed, people in the opposing political parties being put in prison and killed and tortured. This is not a free society."
Mr. Gore held that the United States could not afford to look inward and had to reach out to other countries in order to prosper. In the case of Mexico, he said, free trade encouraged that country to move more quickly toward an open economy and a Democratic government.
Mr. Gore acknowledged that "Mexico is not yet a free democracy," and still lacked "full protection for human rights."
"But they've been making tremendous progress," he said. "And the progress has been associated with this new relationship with the United States."
During the last part of the debate, Mr. Gore and Mr. Perot took questions from callers.
An American woman calling from Mexico City said Japanese companies were waiting to move into Mexico in droves if the North American trade accord goes down.
Mr. Perot seized the opportunity to to say that in fact the trade agreement gives some special advantages to Japanese companies.
Mr. Gore said that was indeed the case. Companies like Honda and Toyota that have plants in the United States would indeed benefit, he said, creating more jobs here for Americans.
As part of his argument that Mexico did not deserve equal billing with the United States, Mr. Perot said the environment south of the border was one of the most polluted in the world. Companies can take advantage of lax environmental standards.
The Rio Grande, he said, is the most polluted river in the Western Hemisphere.
Mr. Gore responded, "If we defeat Nafta, we'll lose all leverage over the enforcement of Mexico's environmental laws."
 
Two Interpretations
 The White House and its partisans organized a quick response to the broadcast soon after it ended, arranging for former President Jimmy Carter to telephone reporters and faxing pro-accord statements around town that declared Mr. Gore the winner.
Mr. Carter said he was pleasantly surprised at the outcome.
"I was uncertain about whether it was a good idea, because I didn't know how Ross Perot and Al Gore would shape up against each other," Mr. Carter said. "Ross Perot bombed out."
But Ralph Nader, the head of Public Citizen and an ardent opponent of the proposed pact, said the broadcast had glossed over essential facts. Mr. Gore, he said, was "smooth and deliberate and misleading and disingenuous."
"It had one great asset," he said. "It greatly expanded, both in anticipation and during post-mortems, the number of Americans who now know something about Nafta and are either skeptical against it or for it."
The more Americans know, Mr. Nader said, the more they will dislike the agreement.
For his part, Mr. Perot said afterward, "This is not show business. I don't care if I looked pretty or ugly up there. I'm here for the American people."

HEADLINE: CHINA MAY ALLOW RED CROSS TO VISIT DISSIDENTS IN JAIL

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Nov. 9

 BODY:
Signaling what would be a major policy shift on human rights, China said today that it would give "positive consideration" to allowing the Red Cross to visit more than 3,000 political prisoners.
Speaking with United States journalists, Foreign Minister Qian Qichen also said China viewed a meeting next week between President Clinton and the Chinese Communist Party Secretary, Jiang Zemin, as not for "picture taking," but as a discussion of "a broader and longer-term perspective" on bilateral relations. 
 The talks are to be held in Seattle during a meeting of national leaders from both sides of the Pacific.
 
'Left Over From the Cold War'
 Mr. Qian indicated that Mr. Jiang would take a hard line against Washington's policy of linking trade preferences to China's human-rights record, a policy that the United States has insisted on since the 1989 military crackdown at Tiananmen Square.
"China does not accept linking questions unrelated to trade," Mr. Qian said. "This method is a means left over from the cold-war era. It is a means to exert pressure, and therefore one cannot expect China to accept this."
Mr. Clinton said in May that "overall, significant progress" in improving China's human-rights record would be the main criterion for whether he renewed China's favorable trade status with the United States next June.
 
Skepticism From Christopher
 Just three weeks ago, Secretary of State Warren Christopher said he did not think he could recommend renewal of China's trade privileges because of China's human-rights record.
But in answer to a question about the desire by rights groups to inspect prisons, Mr. Qian said, "I believe that if the Red Cross does put forward such a request for exchanges, we would give positive consideration to that request."
[State Department officials said in Washington that the apparent decision by China to allow the Red Cross access to prisoners would be an important factor in determining whether China's favored trade status would be extended.]
Western diplomats and human-rights workers, who have been urging China to take such a step for years, applauded the move. If carried out, it would reverse four decades of refusals to allow any outside humanitarian organization access to the tens of thousands of Chinese who have been imprisoned, tortured or persecuted for their political beliefs.
Coming as it did days before Mr. Qian and Mr. Jiang leave for the United States, the statement was clearly timed to defuse the contentious atmosphere over China's record on rights.
Even though Mr. Qian rejected a link between trade and human rights, the turnabout on access to prisoners is clearly part of China's strategy to improve relations.
Access to prisoners is an explicit condition of Mr. Clinton's executive order on China's future trade relations. The order says China must make progress within one year on "insuring humane treatment of prisoners, such as by allowing access to prisoners by international humanitarian and human rights organizations."
The Asian representative for the International Committee of the Red Cross, Christophe Swinarski, said in a telephone interview from Hong Kong that the Red Cross would take Mr. Qian's statement "very seriously." He hinted that talks on prison access could begin this week when Mr. Swinarski passes through Beijing on his way to North Korea.
John T. Kamm, an American businessman who has carried on private humanitarian work in China for years, characterized Mr. Qian's statement as "a significant change in the opinion of the Chinese Government."
"To me, the immediate impact of this announcement," he said, "is that it delivers a message to every warden holding prisoners that they better clean up their act because there is a very good chance the Red Cross is coming."
Apropos the talks in Seattle, business leaders in the United States have urged the Clinton Administration and the Chinese leadership to repair their relationship, which has been dominated by Washington's reprisals and threats on trade since China's crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in 1989. The crackdown has been followed by four years of harsh political repression.
Some corporate leaders fear United States companies will fall behind those in Japan and Europe in building markets in China, whose economy is growing by 13 percent this year and may continue to grow 10 percent a year for the rest of the decade.
Business leaders have also warned that if Mr. Clinton cancels China's most-favored-nation trade status, the loss of markets could further slow the growth of the United States economy.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Welcomed in Washington
 WASHINGTON, Nov. 9 (Special to The New York Times) -- State Department officials said today that the apparent decision by Beijing to allow the Red Cross access to political prisoners would be an important factor in whether Secretary of State Christopher would recommend extending China's preferred trade status.
State Department officials said that since it often takes more than a year for the Red Cross to reach agreement with a government to interview prisoners, actual visits need not take place before Mr. Christopher makes his recommendations to President Clinton next year.
But the officials said China must either allow visits or engage in serious talks with the Red Cross in order to have its new position counted in its favor.
United States officials have been pressing the Chinese for some time to allow the Red Cross to meet with political prisoners. The Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, Winston Lord, raised the subject during a visit to Beijing in May, and Senator Charles S. Robb, a Virginia Democrat, did the same in August.

HEADLINE: THE FREE TRADE ACCORD: Right and Wrong;
Exaggerations? Yes, Particularly by Perot

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 9

 BODY:
As has been the case with much of the fight over the North American Free Trade Agreement, the debate tonight between Vice President Al Gore and Ross Perot included some misleading and exaggerated arguments on both sides.
Their disagreements ranged from the sweeping (whether the pact would result in massive layoffs across the United States) to the obscure (the pact's rules on certain labels of Tennessee bourbon). But a review of their statements on CNN's "Larry King Live" indicates that Mr. Perot tended to stray a little further from the facts than did Mr. Gore. 
 For instance, Mr. Perot complained that the networks had sold time to the pact's advocates but not to its opponents. Actually, both sides have bought advertisements of up to a minute on NBC.
What Mr. Perot was apparently referring to was the recent refusal of all three networks to displace a show in their fall schedules to make way for Mr. Perot's latest half-hour "infomercial" criticizing the pact. NBC did sell Mr. Perot a half-hour for such a program during the Memorial Day weekend when many reruns were scheduled.
By far the most heated clash today came when Mr. Gore asserted that Mr. Perot stood to gain financially if the agreement passed and also if it failed.
This exchange centered on a free-trade zone that surrounds Alliance Airport near Fort Worth. The land in the zone is owned by a company that belongs to Mr. Perot and his son, Ross Perot Jr. In such zones, the Commerce Department agrees to have the Customs Service delay collection of tariffs normally charged on imports and reduce some tariffs on components used to assemble goods within the zone.
Mr. Gore implied that Mr. Perot had gained a relative advantage in the trade zone that would be lost if the trade agreement passed and tariffs fell everywhere. "If it's good enough for him," Mr. Gore said, "why not the rest of the country?
On the other hand, Mr. Gore went on to argue that Mr. Perot and the trade zone which was approved early this autumn, would benefit if Congress approved the pact and trade with Mexico increased.
 
Family Documents Are Cited
 That assertion appears to be borne out by documents filed long ago by the Perot family to win the free-trade zone for its land around Alliance Airport.
In those documents, the family argued that the airport project would be helped by passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement because it would increase the volume of freight flowing through the airport area. The family business is run by Mr. Perot's son, but Mr. Perot retains a large stake.
Adding a final argument to the bevy he had arrayed around the potentially sensitive topic of the airport trade zone, Mr. Gore went on to say that if the pact was defeated, the Perot family would benefit by handling the increase in imports of goods made in Mexico by factories that would flee the United States.
All of Mr. Gore's arguments were rejected by Mr. Perot, who said that while he could make lots of money toting factories to Mexico if the agreement is passed, he was setting that potential benefit aside to argue instead in the national interest.
Mr. Perot's responses to Mr. Gore on the subject, while fervent, included few specifics. Mr. Perot initially said the airport was owned by the city of Fort Worth, then later said that he owned a minority stake in it. The facts lie somewhere in between; he owns a stake in the free-trade industrial zone around the airport.
Interestingly, the last of Mr. Gore's assertions runs counter to arguments the Administration has made in favor of the agreement. While the Vice President said today that manufacturing jobs would flow south in the absence of the pact, President Clinton and others have argued that there is little economic incentive for American factories to relocate.
 
Feint-by-Number Tactics
 During the rest of the debate, both men engaged in a variety of statistical distortions.
In the opening minutes, for example, Mr. Gore said that Mexicans bought 750,000 cars a year but that Detroit's Big 3 sold only 1,000 of them. The Vice President was referring only to the number of cars Detroit ships to Mexico from factories in the United States each year.
In fact, United States auto makers' increasingly efficient factories in Mexico dominate the market there. One of the biggest fears of American labor unions is that the Big 3 will use these factories to supply the United States market once the free-trade agreement eliminates the United States' current taxes on vehicles built in Mexico: 2.5 percent on cars and 25 percent on light trucks.
Mr. Gore came closer to the truth than Mr. Perot on another of the most hotly contested issues in the debate -- the extent to which American exports to Mexico actually stay there. Mr. Perot asserted that two-fifths of these southbound shipments consisted of "phony exports" -- parts assembled into products that were in turn shipped to the United States. Another two-fifths of the exports, he said, consisted of machinery used to build products mainly for the American market.
Mr. Gore more accurately addressed the first issue -- parts that come back to the United States in Mexican products. He said that 80 or 90 percent of American exports physically stay in Mexico. A recent study by the International Trade Commission, a bipartisan Federal agency that analyzes the effects of trade agreements and is independent of the Administration and Congress, found that the figure was 78 percent last year, up from 68 percent in 1987.
 
Exports of Machinery

Commerce Department figures indicate that the figures Mr. Perot cited about machinery exports were also exaggerated. Machinery accounted for 33 percent of American exports to Mexico last year, but this included everything from hospital imaging equipment to construction cranes, in addition to factory equipment. The United States is most competitive internationally in machinery, which accounted for 39 percent of all American exports to the rest of the world last year.
Sounding one of his central political themes, Mr. Perot said the free trade agreement was laced with special deals for influential companies. In making the charge, he accurately cited the inclusion of a $17 million break for Honda. The agreement would retroactively cancel an assessment on Honda Motors that was levied by the Customs Service after agents determined that Hondas imported from Canada had not been meeting the North American content levels required to avoid paying duties.
But Mr. Perot did not mention that the original assessment on Honda had been made in a politically charged process in which the Customs Service used an arcane method to measure the percentage of American parts used in Honda's cars. The North American pact would simplify these arcane rules in a way that would help Honda retroactively but would hurt Honda and other Japanese auto companies in the long run by requiring them to use more and more American parts that Detroit automakers already use.
In another attack, Mr. Perot maintained that three dozen business executives owned 54 percent of the Mexican economy and were recently asked by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari for campaign contributions of $25 million apiece. While the $25 million figure was right, the description of the potential donors was inaccurate. Some of the executives were representatives of broad trade associations composed of many companies, and some of the campaign contributions might have come from companies not owned by the executives.
President Salinas abandoned the plan after its public disclosure, and the ruling party did not end up with the money.

HEADLINE: Yeltsin Promotes a Charter That Is Very Much His

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Nov. 9

 BODY:
President Boris N. Yeltsin went on national television tonight to open his campaign for a new constitution that he promised would help restore "law and order" to a country that has seen little of either in the last two years.
"We need order, but not the horrible repressive order of the Stalinist camps," Mr. Yeltsin said. "Russia needs a steady, law-based order badly," he added, not an "iron hand" but a "democratic state that will insure progress toward a normal and worthy life for citizens, toward prosperity for a single, integral Russia." 
 Russians are to vote on the draft constitution and elect a new parliament on Dec. 12.
After two years of numbing political quarrels that ended last month in the horrifying spectacle of Russians killing Russians in the streets of Moscow, most citizens seem to agree the country needs clear rules -- for themselves, but mostly for their leaders.
"We need a constitution in order not to dash from one extreme to another, in order to calm down, in order to make fewer mistakes," Mr. Yeltsin said in a rare admission that he, too, sometimes needs to be brought back into line.
 
What's in It for the People
 Under the draft constitution, which Mr. Yeltsin approved on Monday, citizens are guaranteed freedom of speech, of religion, of assembly and of travel. Rights to private property, including the right to own land, which was taboo under the Soviet constitution, are explicitly protected.
Some of these clauses were in the Soviet Constitution; others had been added over the last few years as the Congress of People's Deputies, which the President has disbanded, worked its will through myriad, often contradicting amendments. Other clauses, like the right to own land, are new.
Unlike the United States Constitution, which lays out broad principles, the draft Russian constitution sets out legislative specifics, with guarantees of free medical care, free education, a sound environment, protection against unemployment and affordable housing.
But experience taught Soviet citizens to be wary of promises, and there is still reason for Russians to be skeptical. For instance, both the old and the new constitutions promise "freedom of movement, freedom to choose a place to live and to stay." But Moscow and other major cities continue to vigorously enforce the Soviet system of residence permits.
 
What's in It for Yeltsin
 Nor is it lost on Russians that the draft is essentially a political document. As the editor of the newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta wrote today in an editorial, "It will be a constitution for presidents in general, and for President Yeltsin in particular."
Based loosely on the French Constitution, which also blends a strong executive and a parliament, the draft Russian constitution gives the president extraordinary latitude.
The lower house, or Duma, has control over the budget. And the President needs its consent to name (but not to dismiss) a Prime Minister. But if the Duma refuses the president's choice three times in a row, then it too can be disbanded -- just as Mr. Yeltsin disbanded the last Parliament in September, in defiance of the Constitution.
The new document removes other obstacles that had blocked Mr. Yeltsin's use of power: there will be no vice president, eliminating the chance of any more dangerous power plays by erstwhile running mates, and the head of the central bank will be answerable only to the president.
 
Who Will Implement It
 In his speech tonight, Mr. Yeltsin took pains to tell voters that this was no hastily patched together document but the product of a three-year process. And yet, in its final stages, the pretense of a broad-based consensus gave away to the sheer force of presidential will.
Over the protests of some regional leaders, Mr. Yeltsin's team emerged last weekend with a document that clearly reasserted central control aimed at halting the centrifugal forces that have been tugging at the edges of the Russian Federation.
For candidates running for the 450 seats in the Duma, there were also surprises. Until last week, they thought they were running for four-year terms; under the draft constitution, their terms have been cut to two years.
Nor is the anomaly of a single election for a new constitution and a new legislature lost on Russia's crisis-hardened students of politics.
 
Who Is Really in Charge
 Describing the new constitution and the new legislature, Aleksandr Minkin wrote today in Moskovsky Komsomolets: "Since they are born at the same time (and both of them from Zeus's head), they are brother and sister. The new constitution will never be the mother of the parliament. We are presented with some kind of almost out-of-wedlock parliament."
Mr. Yeltsin's statement over the weekend that he no longer intends to hold early presidential elections next year was regarded by many as further proof that for the moment anyway, Russia's future will be determined by a leader who will preside over two parliamentary elections before his term runs out in 1996.
"Such tactics appear to be very dangerous," a journalist said in the newspaper Izvestia. "By playing down the role of the future Parliament, the measures contradict both the interest of most parties who have decided to take part in the election and the very spirit of the election campaign."
Already several people, including Sergei Stankevich, a top Yeltsin adviser, are predicting that the constitution is bound to be a temporary one, a bridge to carry Russia through its next turbulent decade.
As one regional leader told reporters last week, "Life does not end with this Constitution."

HEADLINE: Stoked by Ethnic Conflict, Refugee Numbers Swell

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 9

 BODY:
The spread of ethnic conflict since the end of the cold war has pushed the number of refugees to 44 million people, or more than one in every 130 inhabitants of the globe, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees reported today.
The number of people qualifying as refugees because they have been driven across an international frontier has climbed steadily from 2.5 million in 1970 to 19.7 million today, taking into account the recent mass exodus from the tiny African state of Burundi. In addition, roughly 24 million people have been forced into exile within their own countries. 
 The figures were presented by the High Commissioner, Sadako Ogata, in a report titled "The State of the World's Refugees -- the Challenge of Protection."
 
Intervention for Prevention
 The increase occurred despite the return of some 2.4 million refugees to their countries of origin during 1992.
"The massive number of people on the move has weakened international solidarity and endangered the time honored tradition of granting asylum to those in genuine need of protection," the report says. "The traditional system of protecting refugees has come dangerously close to breakdown."
The crisis is forcing the refugee agency to expand its mandate to help not just refugees forced across frontiers but also internally displaced people to prevent their becoming refugees.
While insisting on refugees' right to asylum in foreign countries, Mrs. Ogata said that preventing people from becoming refugees lies in the "realms of peaceful resolution of conflict, respect for human rights, economic development, stable participatory government, a fair and independent judiciary and tolerance for diversity."
But the agency, which expects to spend $1.3 billion on the care and protection of refugees this year, says that political solutions cannot substitute for helping those who need assistance.
 
Iran Tops List
 In particular, Mrs. Ogata warned that Security Council trade sanctions against such countries as Iraq and parts of the former Yugoslavia are exacerbating the plight of the people.
Asia still has the largest number of refugees with some 7.2 million last year, although that figure is down from 8.6 million in 1991. Africa follows with 5.4 million refugees, while Europe is now in third place with 3.6 million, largely a result of the fighting in the Balkans. The number of refugees in Latin America, mainly the result of the civil wars in Central America, has dropped below 1 million.
Iran is currently granting asylum to the largest number of refugees in the world, a total of 4.1 million, including 2.9 million Afghans and 1.2 million dissident Iraqi Kurds and Shiite Muslims. It is followed by Pakistan with 1.6 million Afghans and Malawi, with about 1 million refugees fleeing the civil war in neighboring Mozambique.
The report highlights the growing reluctance of industrialized countries to accept refugees, listing Austria, Canada, Germany, the United States and Britain among countries that are tightening asylum laws.
 
Germany Feels Effects
 In 1983, only 100,000 people asked for asylum in Western Europe, North America, Australia and Japan. But by 1992 the number had risen to 800,000. Over the same period the number of asylum-seekers arriving in Western Europe climbed from 30,000 a year to over 680,000. Germany has been the most seriously affected, with the number of asylum seekers rising from 121,000 in 1989 to 438,000 in 1992. Although Bonn is tightening its asylum laws, Germany remains the industrial country with the most refugees, providing asylum to 827,000 at the end of 1992. So far the numbers of refugees to Western Europe from the East have been lower than expected.
 In the United States the total number of refugees declined slightly, falling from 482,000 in 1991 to 473,000 last year.
The report says that the majority of asylum seekers are refused refugee status, though most manage to stay on illegally or under special dispensations. Only 20 percent of asylum-seekers were accepted by European Community countries in 1991, but about 80 percent remained in those states.

HEADLINE: THE FREE TRADE ACCORD: MEDIA WATCH;
Personalities and Pictures: A Made-for-TV Debate

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 9

 BODY:
Sometimes there is a political event so transcendentally weird, so Silly Putty, to use one of tonight's Perot-isms, that it almost defies description.
Tonight's big Nafta debate on "Larry King Live" on CNN was not exactly Webster and Clay. More like Punch and Judy -- with charts instead of bats. 
 Mr. Perot showed up for the 9 P.M. show with so many charts and pictures that the CNN producers had to provide a small table for him to stack them. Then, when the Gore contingent showed up and discovered the imbalance of chart power, they demanded their own little table.
"It's chart wars," replied a White House official, who was asked midway through the debate how it was going. Promising that the Vice President would not run out of graphics, he added, "The night is still young."
Despite the astonishing proliferation of visual aids, the debate certainly was not a primer on the pros and cons of the complicated trade agreement with Mexico and Canada. It was a confusing blizzard of facts and figures, almost all of them contradicting each other. And whatever facts might have come through to the average viewer were overwhelmed by the nasty tone of the encounter.
The television contest, once again, raised the question of whether forums usually used by addiction-confessing movie stars and book-hawking authors can work well for substantive political discourse. On the other hand, this was the spot where Mr. Perot suddenly announced the Presidential bid that won him 19 percent of the vote.
 
Camera Tactics
 For 90 minutes, Vice President Al Gore and Ross Perot mostly bickered about who was interrupting whom, who was avoiding answering whom and who was lying about whom. Mr. Perot tried not to look at Mr. Gore, preferring to talk directly into the camera and complained when the Vice President addressed questions directly to him. For his part, the Vice President, whose main tactic was to make Mr. Perot look kooky, spent most of his time smiling at his opponent rather patronizingly.
A typical exchange:
Mr. Gore: "How do you stop it without Nafta?"
Mr. Perot: "Give me your whole mind."
Mr. Gore: "Yeah, I'm listening. I haven't heard the answer, but go ahead."
Mr. Perot: "That's because you haven't quit talking. Are you going to listen? Work on it."
Or this:
Mr. Gore: "I mean, humor me, if you would, and ----"
Mr. Perot: "No, won't. I don't think I can."
Or this from Mr. Perot, who seemed particularly keen on policing the interruptions: "Please, let's have an unnatural event and try not to interrupt me."
Although the television debate was ostensibly a chance to talk about the issues involved in opening an era of free trade with Canada and Mexico, the hottest question in Washington, the White House had acknowledged in advance that its main goal was to turn Mr. Perot into the face of the opposition to the agreement and to discredit that face.
From the start, that was clearly Mr. Gore's main purpose.
The Vice President's staff felt he got off to a fast tactical start when he won the noon coin toss, calling tails, and got to choose his seat. He chose the middle seat, with the more flattering camera angle, leaving the outside seat for Mr. Perot, which offered viewers a close-up of his Texas-sized ears, floating right above the CNN logo. But to even out the staging, they had adjustable chairs so that when seated, Mr. Perot could appear as tall as Mr. Gore.
Mr. Gore tried to undercut Mr. Perot's credibility by accusing him of seeking to benefit financially and politically from a defeat of the trade pact. He accused Mr. Perot of covering up how much money he had spent on the anti-agreement lobbying campaign. And at one point he went into an attack intended to make Mr. Perot look like a wacky Chicken Little. The Vice President said that before the Persian Gulf war, the businessman had gone on "Larry King Live" and predicted that the fighting would "lead to the death of 40,000 American troops."
 
Failed Predictions
 He also said Mr. Perot had predicted that 100 American banks would fail on the day after Mr. Clinton's inauguration.
Although Mr. Gore was never able to push Mr. Perot into one of his renowned tantrums, the Texan did seem hard pressed at times to stay calm. Mr. Perot was the one who initiated most of the squabbling about the protocol of the debate.
Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, was exultant afterwards.
"We showed Mr. Perot for what he is tonight," Mr. Kantor told reporters at the CNN studio in Northeast Washington. "He's for fear. You don't even need to spin tonight."
While Mr. Gore was busy trying to scare America with Mr. Perot, Mr. Perot was busy trying to scare Americans with Mexico (and trying to paint Mr. Gore as a rude young fellow who wanted to ask him questions when Mr. Perot had already said several times that only Larry King was allowed to do that).
Mr. Perot began his part of the fight with a series of poignant photographs, which he described as hovels in Mexico that workers in a big American plant built next to the factory. He said that people were building homes out of cardboard and that they were worse off than American livestock. The point, which Mr. Perot never really explained, apparently was that if trade barriers were lifted, American companies would move their plants to Mexico where they could hire workers who would be paid next to nothing.
 
Pictures of a Shack
 Showing a picture of a man hammering together his cardboard shack, Mr. Perot said: "Do you know what his dream is? To someday have an outhouse."
Taking up another popular anti-pact argument, Mr. Perot said Mexico's environmental standards were too lax. Talking about a different factory in Mexico, he said, "A disproportionate number of the babies born in the shanty town around that plant are born without a brain. Now, I don't care if you're poor or rich, if your baby is born without a brain because a U.S. company is willing to take advantage of workers to that extent, that's wrong."
At first, Mr. Gore tried to out-folksy Mr. Perot, by drawing forth his Tennessee drawl and talking about a friend from Elmwood, Tenn., who make tires, which he pronounced "tars."
But that effort by the Vice President, who grew up mostly in a fancy hotel suite in Washington as the son of a Senator, may have fallen a bit flat when he tried to counter Mr. Perot's stark photographs of poor Mexicans by presenting his rival with a black and white photograph of two members of Congress who looked like undertakers: Reed Smoot and Willis C. Hawley, who introduced a famous protectionist tariff in 1930 that damaged the economy.
Mr. Perot disdainfully took the gift, which the Vice President said he had had specially framed, and slammed it face down onto the desk in front of him.
The two men, realizing that the audience of the show itself is relatively small, were mostly aiming their comments at lawmakers and others in the know. For the rest of the country, they knew that it was important to get something snazzy played back on the news tonight or tomorrow. So they devoted a fair amount of time to coming up with the best sound bite.
Mr. Perot's best line may have been the one about the outhouse, but Mr. Gore got in the last word, saying of Mr. Perot: "He started as the head of United We Stand America, and I'm afraid he'll end up as the head of Divided We Fall."
As Mr. Perot came out of the studio, a well-dressed wife of a union executive, who seemed to be a friend of his, welled up with tears and told him what a good job he had done.
"Oh," he said, laughing and throwing up his hands, "you're just a public citizen."

HEADLINE: THE FREE TRADE ACCORD;
Excerpts From the Free Trade Debate Between Gore and Perot

GRAPHIC: Following are excerpts from the debate last night between Vice President Al Gore and Ross Perot over the North American Free Trade Agreement, as broadcast by CNN and recorded by The New York Times. The debate was moderated by Larry King in his television studio in Washington.
 
 
For and Against
 KING When President Bush signed this in San Antonio, he was on our show, and then a few nights later, I was with you and the then-President -- Governor, now President-elect Clinton, asked about this, Nafta, and the President said, to the best of my memory: "Well, I'm basically for it. I want to see the side agreements, I want to hear what the unions object to and then I'll come back and sort of let you know." But it was not a definitive "Yes." What changed?
 GORE Well, we negotiated two side agreements that protect labor and protect the environment and not until the two side agreements were completed did we agree to support Nafta. Now this is a good deal for our country, Larry, and let me explain why.
KING But you were hedging early?
GORE Well, we said from the very beginning that we wanted to improve the basic arrangement, which we did with the side agreements, and the reason why this is so important can be illustrated by the story of a good friend of mine that I grew up with named Gordon Thompson who lives in Elmwood, Tenn., with his wife, Sue, and his son Randy. He makes tires for a living. He is a member of the United Rubber Workers and he is for this because he has taken the time to look at how it affects his job and his family.
We make the best tires in the world. But we have a hard time selling them in Mexico because they have a 20 percent tax collected at the border on all of the tires that we try to sell. Now when they make tires and sell them into the United States, the tax at the border is zero. So it's, it's a one-way street. Nafta changes that. It makes it even-steven.
KING So he'll make more tires.
GORE Well, his job will be more secure. They'll make more tires. They'll be able to sell more tires. His son will have a better chance of going into that line of work, if that's what he should decide he wants to do.
And remember this, I mean, people think, well, they don't buy tires. Mexico bought 750,000 new cars last year. The Big 3 sold them only 1,000 because they have the same barriers against our cars. Those barriers will be eliminated by Nafta. We'll sell 60,000, not 1,000, in the first year after Nafta. Every one of those cars has four new tires and one spare. We'll create more jobs with Nafta.
KING Weren't you a free-trader always, Ross?
PEROT I am a free-trader now.
KING Do you favor some sort of Nafta?
PEROT Absolutely.
KING Then what's your rub?
PEROT The problem is this is not good for the people of either country.
KING Either country?
PEROT Yes. I think the important thing for everybody watching this show tonight to remember: This is not an athletic contest, this is not a question of who wins -- whether I win or the Vice President wins -- this is a question of do the people of the United States and the people of Mexico win. Now that's the important issue, and I'm sure we're in agreement on that. My concern is very simple.
I look at many years experience in the maquiladoras program and ----
KING These are the ----
PEROT Here is what I see. This -- we have a lot of experience in Mexico. I've been accused of looking in the rear-view mirror. That's right. I'm looking back at reality. And here is what I see after many years: Mexican workers' life, standard of living and pay has gone down, not up. After many years of having U.S. companies in Mexico, this is the way Mexican workers live all around big, new U.S. plants.
Now, just think if you owned a big U.S. company and you went down to see your new plant and you found slums all around it, your first reaction would be, "Why did you build this plant in the middle of slums?" And your plant manager would say, "Well, there were no slums here when we built the plant." And you say, "Well, why are they here now?" He says, "This is where the workers work ----

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
Wages in for Mexicans
 PEROT All I'm saying is ----
KING ---- what would you ----
PEROT ---- is if after 10 active years -- this has been in effect since the 60's, but let's say 10 active years -- you would think the standard of living of the Mexican worker would begin to come up. Instead, it continues to go down by design. Thirty-six families own over half the country; 85 million people work for them in poverty. U.S. companies, because it is so difficult to do business in this country, can't wait to get out of this country and go somewhere else and, if possible, get labor that costs one-seventh of what it costs in the United States.
GORE How would you change it? How would you change it?
PEROT Very simply. I would go back and study. First, we look at this. It doesn't work. If ----
GORE Well, what specific changes would you make in it?
PEROT I can't, unless you let me finish, I can't answer your question. Now, you asked me, and I'm trying to tell you.
GORE Right, well, you brought your charts tonight, so I want to know what specific changes ----

 	 	 		.. .	 	
 
Previous Accords
 GORE I've heard Mr. Perot say in the past that, as the carpenters says, measure twice and cut once. We've measured twice on this. We have had a test of our theory and we've had a test of his theory. Over the last five years, Mexico's tariffs have begun to come down because they've made a unilateral decision to bring them down some, and as a result there has been a surge of exports from the United States into Mexico, creating an additional 400,000 jobs, and we can create hundreds of thousands of more if we continue this trend.
We know this works. If it doesn't work, you know, we give six months notice and we're out of it. But we've also had a test of his theory.
PEROT When?
GORE In 1930, when the proposal by Mr. Smoot and Mr. Hawley was to raise tariffs across the board to protect our workers. And I brought some pictures, too.
KING You're saying Ross is a protectionist?
GORE This is, this is a picture of Mr. Smoot and Mr. Hawley. They look like pretty good fellows. They sounded reasonable at the time; a lot of people believed them. The Congress passed the Smoot-Hawley Protection Bill. He wants to raise tariffs on Mexico. They raised tariffs, and it was one of the principal causes, many economists say the principal cause, of the Great Depression in this country and around the world.
Now, I framed this so you can put it on your wall if you want to.
PEROT Thank you, thank you, thank you.
KING Would raising tariffs produce another ----
PEROT We're talking to two totally different, unrelated situations. Now, you do need to measure twice and cut once, but then if you have a program that is failing, you should not institutionalize it.
See, the Mexican program has failed. It's failed the people of Mexico. It's failed the people of the United States. These numbers they give of exports from the United States are not realistic numbers. For example, they count in the Government figures automobile parts going into Mexico to be put into cars made by U.S. car companies in Mexico and shipped back to the United States to be sold as if Mexican consumers bought those parts. That didn't happen.
Then, if you take a ---- let's just say you have a piece of glass crystal that you spend $100 making it in this country, you're going to send it to Mexico to have $10 of additional work done to it, they count it as a $100 export, then they count it as $100 to come into Mexico from the U.S., then they count it as a $110 import back to the United States.
Now then, when you look at how they count, the real export figures to Mexican consumers are tiny. The used factory equipment coming from U.S. factories going into Mexico -- new factories going to Mexico ----
GORE Are not more?
PEROT No, no, no. It's equipment from the U.S. into Mexico. That's used equipment. Then, we count that as if Mexican consumers bought it. Nobody bought anything. Old equipment must come to Mexico.
GORE Let me respond to that if I can because, unfortunately, there's a grain of truth to that, but it's so tiny that ---- I mean it's not a half-truth. It doesn't quite rise to that level. There are a few things in that category, but the vast majority, 80 to 90 percent, are exports that stay in Mexico and are bought there.
Here's what's happened to our trade surplus. And these figures are net figures. It takes into account everything that he's talking about in that small category. In 1987, before Mexico started lowering its taxes at the border, its tariffs, we had a $5.7 billion trade deficit with Mexico. After five years, our, the goods we make and sell into Mexico, the volume has been growing twice as fast as the goods they make and sell in the United States.
So last year we had a $5.4 billion trade surplus. Now if that trend continued for another two years -- and Nafta will by removing those barriers greatly accelerate it -- we will have a larger trade surplus with Mexico than with any country in the entire world.
KING Why are trade unions so opposed to it, then?
GORE Well, some of them ----
KING If your friend, who makes the tire, and he is a union member, is going to benefit from this, why is the unions aligned with Ross Perot? Why do we have this alignment of Ross Perot, unions, Jesse Jackson, Pat Buchanan and Ralph Nader?
GORE Because some of them make the same mistake that, with all due respect, Mr. Perot makes. They confuse the bad trade deals in the past with this one, which is the first time we've been able to get one that's even-steven, with zero on -- zero taxes on both sides. You know, I told you about my friend Gordon Thompson? The international president of his union opposes Nafta; Gordon Thompson has taken the time to look at the facts, and he supports Nafta.
Let me tell you who else has taken the time: Every living former President of the United States in both parties, the two-termers and the one-termers. Every former Secretary of State, every former Secretary of Defense, Secretary of Treasury. Every living Nobel Prize winner in economics -- conservatives, liberals, everyone in between. They've never agreed on anything ----
PEROT That fact ----
GORE Let me just finish this one point ---- and distinguished Americans from Colin Powell to Tip O'Neill to Rush Limbaugh, Ross Perot Jr., the head of his business, Mort Myerson, Orson Swindle, the head of United We Stand last time; and Ross Perot Sr. supported it until he started running for President and attempting to bring out the politics of fear.
KING Ross.
PEROT Will I be able to speak for a second or two from time to time?
KING You may. You're on.
PEROT Because there's a lot of inaccuracies here. Let's go to the big picture, then skip the personal stuff.
People who don't make anything can't buy anything. Let's start with that. We're 85 percent of the market. Canada is 11 percent of the buying power.
KING Of the total free market.
PEROT And Mexico is only 4 percent. People who don't make anything cannot buy anything. Never forget that.

Accusations Over Airport
 GORE There has been unfair competition from foreign countries that don't let our products in, even though we buy their products. This will help to stop that.
Some people want to stay with the status quo, just keep things the way they are.
We want to open up these barriers. And let me give you a specific example. Valmont Electric Company in Danville, Ill., less than a year ago was trying to sell products into Mexico. They've got a 13 percent tax at the border. We have a zero tax coming the other way. They closed down in Danville. Four hundred jobs lost. They opened up in Mexico with 100 jobs down there, and now they ship their products duty-free back into the United States through the Alliance Airport, which is the free trade zone that Mr. Perot's company has set up for. It's kind of a private free trade zone ----
KING Are you saying Mr. Perot's ----
GORE Outside of Dallas. And they take Valmont Electric's products and distribute them through the United States duty free.
Now, if we pass Nafta, that 13 percent tax that they have at their border would be gone and companies like Valmont could stay here in the United States, sell their products in Mexico and not have to go down there to get over the barrier.
KING Are you saying that Mr. Perot is personally benefiting by attacking Nafta?
GORE I think he has set it up so that he will benefit financially either way. But if Nafta passes, I mean if Nafta is defeated, this family business that has a free-trade zone outside of Dallas will continue to distribute products coming from Mexico into the rest of the United States.
What is the deal with Alliance?
PEROT I think what you meant ---- I'll explain it. What we see here tonight is why our country is $4 trillion in debt, going a billion dollars in debt every working day. Nobody ever focuses on the real problems.
Now, I'm going to try to say this as simply as I can. Alliance Airport is in Fort Worth, Tex., not in Mexico. Alliance Airport is owned by the City of Fort Worth, not my son.
Can you shake your head on that?
GORE No, the ----
PEROT Alliance Airport, check the F.A.A., is owned by ----
GORE You don't ----
PEROT ---- the City of Fort Worth.
GORE You don't, you don't have ----
PEROT The airport ----
GORE ---- ownership of --
PEROT The airport.
GORE ---- of the Alliance Carter Incorporated?
PEROT Please.
KING All right, let him finish.
PEROT Let's have an unnatural event and try not to interrupt me.
KING O.K.
PEROT Now, my son owns land adjoining the airport. Now, the purpose of that land is to build factories and warehouses to be, so that industrial goods can be moved by rail and by air.
KING From the airport?
PEROT Just now. Watch my lips: The jobs will be created in Texas; Texas is in the United States, the workers will be United States citizens. They will be paid U.S. wages. It is a job creator in the United States of America.
And all of this other Silly Putty they throw up. For example, the free-trade zone concept goes back to the 1930's. It is nothing new about the free trade zone concept. You have to apply to the U.S. Government to get it, and if it didn't make sense, I guess they wouldn't have given it to him. But it is not aimed at doing business with Mexico.
GORE You're not involved in it?
PEROT Mexico will be a tiny, little part of this whole operation. O.K. I am putting my country's interest far ahead of my business interest.
KING You would do better with Nafta?
PEROT I would. No, it ---- When I'm in a room with corporate America, the first thing they say is, "Perot, why don't you keep your mouth shut. You could, with your resources, make more money than anybody else."
KING If Nafta ----
PEROT Here is the Nafta gain. Buy U.S. manufacturing companies cheap right after Nafta passes that are labor-intensive that make good products that have marginal profits. Close the factories in the U.S., move the factories to Mexico, take advantage of the cheap labor, run your profits through the roof, sell the company stock at a profit. Go get another one.
GORE That's what they do now.
PEROT You ----
GORE That's what they're doing right now.
KING Are they doing that now?
GORE And they're using Alliance Carter Inc. in part to do it.
PEROT Oh, come on, come on. You're talking about something like a trickle of water coming over Niagara Falls as opposed to the gusher. You know it.

Issue of Japan

CALLER The subject has come up about the possibility of Japanese taking over if Nafta doesn't go through. I'm American. I've been living in Mexico City for many years. There are thousands of Japanese here. They are waiting. They are lurking. What are you people doing? Why ----
GORE Let me answer that.
KING Hold on. What's the finish of it ma'am. All right, I didn't hear the end of it.
GORE Yes, she said, "What are you doing? Why don't you wake up?"
KING Okay. Well, I think the question was ----
PEROT It'll only take a minute to kill this snake, go ahead.
KING Go ahead, kill it.
GORE You're talking about the question, not me, right?
GORE You're talking about the question not me, right?
PEROT No, this question, absolutely.
KING Go ahead, it's for you.
PEROT Just this basic. There's a constant in the Clinton Administration. Any time they get cornered, they go into the what I call the sky is falling routine, the presidency is at stake. The Japanese are coming.
KING The question was she says there are Japanese ----
PEROT Next spring we'll have the British are coming, you know, the ghosts are coming. Look, the Japanese cannot just wander into Mexico, do anything they want to do, dump across our border unless we're stupid enough to let them. Now, if our foreign lobbyists say wired in the way they are now, we'll probably say, ooh, this is wonderful. I can tell you about Japanese deals that have been cut through our foreign lobbyists. I can tell you a deal that's buried in this agreement that gives a $17 million benefit to Honda. It's buried, I can show it to you in print. It's there big time. I can show you a deal --
KING Benefits a single company?
PEROT You bet. I can show you a deal on Tennessee whiskey that will make you just wonder what the heck is going on. The sky is not falling, the Japanese are our friends. They're not a threat. They're not a threat.
GORE Let me respond. Both automobile manufacturers, including Honda in Marysville, Ohio, Nissan in Tennessee, Saturn in Tennessee, all of the companies in Detroit, they benefit because that Mexican tariff is brought down to zero. Every other American from Tennessee, whiskey benefits, every American business potentially benefits if they want to sell in Mexico. Hold on, hold on, because I want to respond to her question. This is extremely important. President Salinas has a trade mission to Japan the month after the vote on Nafta. If we don't take this deal you can bet that Japan will try to take this deal. They'll be in there in a New York minute. Europe will try to get this deal. They are concerned about us taking this deal.
Listen, Larry, we ought to thank our lucky stars that the Mexican people have had the vision and courage to strike out on the American path toward the ideas of Thomas Jefferson, toward democracy, toward free markets and now they just want to know can we take yes for an answer.

HEADLINE: Dow Drops 7.83 Points After a Run-Up Fizzles

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
The stock market has been yearning for more good news on the economy, but when the Government issued a surprisingly reassuring report on inflation yesterday, many investors seemed to evince only one reaction: ho-hum.
To be sure, the Dow Jones industrial average did jump more than 20 points in the first hour of the session, apparently because of the announcement that wholesale prices had declined two-tenths of 1 percent in October. Many private economists had predicted a rise of two-tenths of 1 percent. 
 But the Dow then journeyed downward, ending the day off 7.83 points, at 3,640.07. Other indicators also rose early before falling back to nearly unchanged levels, as if investors remained so guarded and worn-out after the grueling trading of the last few weeks that they refused to take many chances.
"No one wants to be a hero right now," said Edward E. Collins 3d, an executive vice president at Daiwa Securities. "The long-term investors are sitting on the sidelines."
Mr. Collins said some investors may have discounted the bond market's rally yesterday, preferring to wait for more data on the economy in today's report on the Consumer Price Index for October. And the stock market may have been hesitant because of the cloudy fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Vice President Al Gore and Ross Perot debated last night, after the market's close.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 276.4 million shares, slightly better than average and up from Monday's total of 234.3 million shares. Advancing issues led declining issues yesterday by about 4 to 3.
The Dow Jones utilities average, which many analysts consider a harbinger of the market's performance because its components are sensitive to interest rates, hit another 10-month low, falling 2.04 points, to 225.09.
 
Nasdaq Rises 3.63 Points
 Among the broad indicators, the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks edged up 0.12 point, to 460.33. The American Stock Exchange composite index dropped 0.58 point, to 476.02. And the Nasdaq Composite index increased 3.63 points, to 769.84.
Tobacco stocks, which have been heavily traded in recent weeks, were among the most active issues because RJR Nabisco is raising prices on most of its brands, including Camel and Winston. RJR, the Big Board's most active issue yesterday, rose 3/8, to 6 3/4, while Philip Morris jumped 1, to 55 3/4, and American Brands was up 1/8, to 33 1/4.
Telefonos de Mexico was the third most active issue on the Big Board, its American depository receipts rising 1/8, to 50 1/2, amid concern over the free-trade accord.
Among other heavily traded stocks, Wal-Mart Stores was up 3/8, to 28 5/8, after reporting that its quarterly earnings and revenues were record highs. Dun & Bradstreet jumped 1 1/2, to 67 1/2. The company linked the active trading of its stock to its repurchase plan.
 
Motorola and Nextel Rise
 Motorola rose 1, to 99 3/4, after it sold a large group of mobile-radio licenses to Nextel Communications. Nextel's stock was up 1 1/4, to 47 1/4, in Nasdaq trading.
Bank, financial service and life insurance companies did well in response to the news of low inflation. Bankers Trust rose 1 to 76 1/4; First Chicago was up 3/4, to 44 3/4; American Express increased 1 1/4, to 31 7/8, and Wells Fargo jumped 2 1/8, to 112 3/4.
On the Nasdaq, Intuit shot up 5 3/4, to 43 1/2, after the company posted higher quarterly earnings than analysts had predicted.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Maxwell Advisers Seen As Winners in Breakup

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
Regardless of the outcome of today's auction of Macmillan Inc., some clear winners in the deal will be the advisers to Maxwell Communication, the parent company of Macmillan.
The biggest prize will go to Price Waterhouse, the accounting firm that is acting as the administrator in the liquidation sale of Maxwell's assets. According to court documents, Price Waterhouse will earn a fee of an estimated $36 million. That appears to be even more than what J. P. Morgan & Company will receive. The investment bank had already earned more than $6.5 million in fees, the documents show, and could earn several million more. The law firm of Milbank Tweed could earn $6.2 million. The total fees were estimated at $60 million. 
 Bidders in the auction for Macmillan, the crown jewel of the empire of the late Robert Maxwell, waited anxiously last night to learn who would win the venerable publishing house.
 
Decision Expected This Morning
 Administrators, lawyers and investment bankers representing Maxwell Communication were scheduled to meet with the Maxwell Creditors Committee at 8:15 this morning to approve a buyer. The meeting was expected to last two hours.
Maxwell Communication had been operating under the supervision of the Federal Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan and administrators in London since shortly after the mysterious 1991 death of Mr. Maxwell. Price Waterhouse had been administering both the British and the United States bankruptcy proceeding of Maxwell Communication. J. P. Morgan is the banker handling the sale.
The four bidders are believed to be Paramount Communications, Harcourt General, Pearson P.L.C., and the K-III Communications Corporation. Though bidders had agreed not to divulge their offering prices, the publishing company was expected to bring as much as $500 million.
The deal has created some new relationships in the incestuous and intricate network of media companies, investment bankers and their lawyers at a time when Paramount is not only bidding for Macmillan, but is itself the subject of a bidding war betweem Viacom Inc. and QVC Network Inc.
While Lazard Freres was serving as Paramount's investment banker in the sale to Viacom, it is representing Pearson, a rival bidder to Paramount, in the Macmillan deal.
When Martin S. Davis, the chairman of Paramount, first considered bidding for Macmillan, he could not hire Lazard because it was representing Maxwell Communication, according to one banker with knowledge of the discussions.
So Paramount hired Rothschild Inc. to represent it. Later, when Lazard was no longer working for Maxwell, Paramount had already hired a banker. Lazard then found itself a client in Pearson, which is 50 percent owner of Lazard's British unit.
 
Melding Operations
 Paramount could justify paying a higher price for Macmillan than could some of its competitors, several industry experts noted, because melding the two companies would invite some economies of scale.
Although K-III, a publishing company run by former Macmillan executives, does not own book publishing businesses that would have the same cost controls, its management was eager to regain control over a company it once ran and was expected to be an aggressive bidder, according to several executives close to the negotiations.
While Paramount's college publishing business is the largest in the world, and Macmillan's is the seventh largest, a possible merger was not expected to raise antitrust issues because the college textbook market is fragmented, with professors selecting the reading for their classes. In contrast, school districts or state agencies select the reading material for an entire elementary or high school system.
Macmillan represents the last major asset sale of the Maxwell empire. When it is all over, according to documents filed earlier this year with the British and American bankruptcy courts, Price Waterhouse, the two law firms involved in the deal -- Norton Rose is the other -- and the United States bankruptcy examiner and advisers are projected to collect a total of about $60 million in fees.
According to the documents, J. P. Morgan had already earned at least $6.5 million, after the sale of Official Airline Guides and and some other assets. Today's sale of Macmillan is expected to provide a fee of several million dollars more, the documents indicated.
One Maxwell creditor with expertise in bankruptcy investing said yesterday that the fees in this case had been on the high side. Price Waterhouse and Milbank Tweed executives could not be reached for comment yesterday evening. J. P. Morgan declined to comment.
 
Viacom Amends Lawsuit
 Separately, Viacom Inc. amended its antitrust lawsuit against QVC yesterday to include Comcast Corporation, which is supporting QVC in its hostile bid for Paramount Communications.
Viacom had previously filed an antitrust suit against QVC and two companies controlled by John C. Malone, the powerful cable executive, whose Liberty Media Corporation is the largest shareholder in QVC.
The suit charged that a series of practices were anticompetitive and had hurt Viacom. Yesterday's suit contended that other actions were also anticompetitive, including conduct that forced Viacom to raise its offer for Paramount Communications by $2 billion. Viacom had raised its bid twice since the initial merger plan was signed on Sept. 11.

HEADLINE: At Haiti-Dominican Border: Barrier or Loophole?

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BANICA, Dominican Republic, Nov. 4

 BODY:
More a creek than a river, the Rio Artibonito forms the border between Haiti and the Dominican Republic, and for as long as the two countries have existed people on both sides have often just waded across at points like this whenever they wanted to trade with each other.
But with Western ships off the Haitian coast, the success of an oil and arms embargo against Haiti may ultimately depend on enforcement of the sanctions along the country's 241-mile border with the Dominican Republic. 
 So it was no surprise when the Dominican President, Joaquin Balaguer, visited this market town today and proclaimed that there had been no violations of the sanctions.
"Since the embargo began, this country has not sent a single drop of oil to Haiti," Mr. Balaguer said. He said his country would continue to abide by the embargo imposed by the United Nations and the Organization of American States, "so long as they do not condemn the Haitian people to hunger."
 
Embargo Is Reimposed
 The United Nations reimposed the embargo last month after the Haitian military began to renege on an agreement to restore the country's exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, to power.
Mr. Balaguer has since been under growing international pressure to insure that no oil or arms cross the border. But diplomats say his Government is ambivalent at best about complying with its obligations.
With a presidential election only six months away, Mr. Balaguer, who is running for re-election, wants to avoid a situation in which thousands of desperate and hungry Haitians flee across the border and are settled in refugee camps run by the United Nations.
The 87-year-old President's distaste for Haitians is no secret, having been documented in two books he wrote, and he has told foreign diplomats that he thinks the embargo is a mistake. Diplomats and other political experts say Mr. Balaguer had an amiable relationship with Haiti's former Duvalier family dictatorship and has privately expressed dislike for Father Aristide, a leftist priest.
"Balaguer will do everything he can not to respect the embargo," Wilfredo Lozano, director of the Dominican branch of the Latin American Faculty of Social Sciences and an expert on Dominican-Haitian relations, said in an interview in Santo Domingo, the capital. "But he is a practical man, smart enough to know that could lead to confrontation and isolation, so he will observe the forms of the blockade while hoping that holes will open in it."
A diplomat in Santo Domingo said that given the porous nature of the border, "it is accepted that there is going to be some slippage" in the embargo. The countries that want to see Father Aristide return to power are willing to accept some small-scale profiteering, he said, so long as they are certain that Haitian military or Government officials are not running the operation.
"Juan Valdez may be running across the border with 20 one-gallon milk containers full of gasoline strapped to his back," the diplomat said. "But that's not a major violation. It's the 20-truck convoys being waved through the checkpoints that we're worried about, and so far we haven't seen any of that."
Any continuous large-scale truck traffic across the border can take place only through the three main crossings, at Jimani, Dajabon and Elias Pina. The Haitian military is rushing to complete a two-lane road that would allow traffic to flow smoothly from Jimani to the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince, and this has caused international concern about Dominican compliance with the embargo.
In late October, a foreign reporter on the Haitian side of the Jimani crossing saw six heavy trucks pass through in the 15 minutes soldiers allowed him to linger. One of the trucks appeared to be carrying oil, though the nature of its cargo could not be confirmed.
 
Steady Flow of Trucks
 During a five-hour drive on the main highway from Santo Domingo to Jimani recently, only one truck with Haitian license plates was observed. The truck, which was loaded with metal drums of the type used to transport oil, sped away, seemingly when its driver sensed that he was being trailed.
Dominican officials acknowledge there is a steady flow of truck traffic through Jimani into Haiti. But they maintain that all of the goods being exported there or sold openly to Haitians at markets in towns like Banica, often at prices that are triple those of just a few weeks ago, consist of food, medicine and other items specifically exempted from the embargo.
"It is not true that the Dominican Republic does not support the blockade," Deputy Foreign Minister Fabio Herrera Cabral told reporters. "The list of articles being sent is limited to humanitarian articles."
Among the goods crossing from the Dominican Republic into Haiti, Mr. Herrera acknowledged, are rice, sugar, cooking oil and "items for personal cooking," like propane gas. "We are only sending what is permitted, and within that is propane gas, which is for cooking food," he said.
The United Nations has threatened to widen the embargo to cover all goods except vital food and medicine if the Haitian military does not back down. But Western governments are still somewhat reluctant to stiffen the sanctions at this point. Already the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, Haiti is suffering more each week because the fuel cutoff has slowed delivery of supplies.
 
All Oil Is Imported
 The Dominican Republic produces no oil itself, importing it from Venezuela and Mexico under an agreement negotiated in the 1980's. Latin American diplomats in Santo Domingo said Venezuela, one of four countries underwriting the July agreement intended to restore Father Aristide to power, was determined not to let the Dominican Republic flout the embargo.
"A sudden surge in oil imports would not go unnoticed here or in Caracas," one said. "That has not happened yet, but if there are signs of an increase in oil purchases, I am sure that question will be promptly addressed."
The commander of Haiti's armed forces, Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, and the Port-au-Prince police chief, Col. Joseph Michel Francois, have relatives in the Dominican Republic who have come under scrutiny, Haitian exiles in Santo Domingo say. The exiles, who insisted on anonymity, said that a brother of General Cedras had been involved in a small air-charter business in Santo Domingo but that the company's planes were too small to haul large amounts of gasoline.
In recent weeks there has been a noticeable buildup of military and police forces on the Dominican side of the border. Residents of the region say the Dominican troops have been focusing not so much on enforcing the embargo as preventing Haitians from crossing the border and deporting those who have already reached Dominican territory.
At the many checkpoints along the border, armed soldiers stop every car and truck headed toward Haiti, but do not search the vehicles for weapons or other contraband. Instead, they briefly question drivers and passengers in Spanish, hoping to detect Creole-speaking Haitians by their accents.
Dominican press reports say that as many as 600 Haitians have been arrested on Dominican soil and forcibly returned to Haiti and that many of them pay bribes of about $4 a head to Haitian soldiers to stay out of jail.
Mr. Balaguer formally ordered the repatriation campaign halted late last month, saying the armed forces "did not understand my instructions well."

HEADLINE: Paris Journal;
France's Homeless Get Help! Read All About It!

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Nov. 9

 BODY:
After a chilly night huddled in blankets outside the Musee d'Orsay, Georges was up with the sun and ready for a morning's work selling Macadam Journal at an open-air market near the Seine in Paris's elegant 16th arrondissement. By noon, he had earned enough for a good lunch.
"It has made a big difference for me," he said, nodding toward the tabloid newspaper "for the homeless" that he was holding out to passers-by. "I can stay in a small hotel one night out of three, but at least I'm well fed now. And I have saved a bit of money." 
 A hundred yards away, past stalls weighed down with the best meat, fish, vegetables, pates and cheeses that France can offer, Raymond, a slightly unshaven man in his mid-30's, called out softly, "Macadam Journal, the paper of the S.D.F." -- the French initials for "Sans Domicile Fixe," or "No Fixed Address."
"I lost my job last year because of the economic crisis, then things fell apart in my life," he said unapologetically. "But for the past three months I have been doing this and things are looking up. Someone I met selling the paper even offered me a free room."
When Macadam Journal appeared in May, the founders made no claim to originality. Street News in New York and The Big Issue in London both served as inspirations for the new monthly.
 
A Growing Phenomenon
 But the appearance of a street people's newspaper here -- it takes its name from the word used to describe the surface of a road -- is itself confirmation that Paris is beginning to experience social problems long familiar to New York and London. Paris may have always had wine-swilling "clochards" living under its bridges, but the notion of homeless is relatively new here.
The dimensions of the problem are hard to measure. Private associations supporting the homeless estimate that half a million people live in inadequate housing in France, while Government officials put the number of people without a permanent home at about 200,000. What no one disputes is that the phenomenon is growing and that, in Paris at least, the sight of homeless people sleeping in doorways no longer causes surprise.
As winter approaches, both Government and charitable organizations are hurriedly preparing centers that offer a bed and a meal for the homeless. Transportation officials have also set up relief programs to prevent train stations, the subway and airports from becoming improvised shelters from the cold.
But with unemployment now standing at 3.2 million, or 11.8 percent of the work force, and still rising, the underlying causes of the problem remain. Men -- and some women -- lose their jobs, their unemployment benefits run out, they can no longer afford to pay rents and they end up on the streets.
More than for the tramps, drug addicts and the new influx of Romanian Gypsies who try to survive by begging and often upset the public with their fierce panhandling approach, Macadam Journal is intended mainly for those homeless people who are victims of temporary misfortune but who still hope to resume normal lives.
 
Falling on Hard Times
 "We don't deal with clochards," Leila Khallouki, the paper's communications director, said. "We're looking for the new S.D.F. We have some 600 vendors, and 90 percent of them have suffered some accident -- in their lives, families, health or jobs -- that has put them on the streets."
Gerard -- a 36-year-old former businessman who, like others, asked that his full name not be used -- said he lost all his savings when 11 cars that he had exported to Poland were seized in a dispute over customs payments. "I had to leave my apartment and move into a hotel that I pay for daily," he said.
Since July, though, he has been selling Macadam Journal, and he boasts that he was able to save enough to take two children from a broken marriage to Eurodisney. "They don't know what I do because I always appear in jacket and tie," he said.
The newspaper sells on the street for 10 francs, or $1.69, of which the vendor keeps 6 francs, or $1.02. Olivier, who arrived at the monthly's depot in Aubervilliers outside Paris with his 18-month-old girl, Marianne, asserted that he sold 200 copies one Saturday, probably a record. Olivier admitted sheepishly that sales were better when he carried Marianne.
But even with one vendor's daily sales averaging, say, 50 copies, they can still earn around $400 a week, enough to pay for a small hotel and simple meals. "It gives us a chance," Gerard said. "My aim is to come here one day and say, thank you, Martine, I'm not going to sell Macadam Journal anymore."
 
An Extraordinary Success
 Martine Vanden Driessche is editor of the paper, but it is the brainchild of Jacques Chamut, a Belgian businessman who decided that there was a need for a French-language version of The Big Issue, for sale not only in Paris and Brussels but also in other French and Belgian cities where homeless are now appearing.
Written by professional journalists, the 24-page monthly tackles broad social issues for the general reader. And whether people buy it out of sympathy for the vendors or out of interest in its contents, its success has been extraordinary. Its first issue sold 100,000 copies, its fourth 400,000.
Indeed, its example is already being followed. One of its former vendors, Georges Mathis, has founded La Reverbere, which is written by homeless people and is backed by several neighborhood associations. A bimonthly glossy, La Rue, is now also sold by homeless.
For the homeless vendors, who are required to dress as well as possible and are urged to avoid "aggressive" sales tactics, what matters most is that they have recovered some dignity. And at least Macadam Journal has now become a symbol of respectability that seems to reassure the general public.
"What I most like is that people come up to chat," Georges said as he awaited a sale beside a vegetable stall in the 16th arrondissement market. "They want to help people who want to help themselves. If I'm not seen for a few days, they ask, What happened? Are you all right? In the past, they would look the other way."

HEADLINE: A Haven for Hopeless Causes;
Devotions to St. Jude Are Growing, Manhattan Church Says

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

 BODY:
Clutching rosaries or wrinkled prayer cards, thousands of urban pilgrims filed through the sanctuary of St. Francis of Assisi Roman Catholic Church over the course of a recent week, seeking answers to the impossible -- chronic illnesses, broken marriages, lost jobs -- or just a glimpse of happiness. Laborers and executives, blacks and whites, young and old sat together during prayers, lining up afterward for a blessing from a relic of St. Jude, the patron saint of impossible causes.
Attendance at the devotions has doubled at the Manhattan church in the last six years, just one sign of the popularity of this dedication of prayers to a saint who, despite having been one of Christ's 12 Apostles, had been obscure until a priest in Chicago erected a shrine to St. Jude. It has become one of the most durable American devotions, with numerous prayer services that attract even non-Catholics. There are also countless tiny newspaper ads by worshipers that read "Thank you, St. Jude, " and there is even a St. Jude chain letter. 
 Every era spawns its own reasons for interest in the saint -- the Depression and World War II saw the devotion become so popular that some priests broadcast them on the radio. Recently, the Persian Gulf War, a stale economy and the AIDS scourge have attracted new followers in quest of miraculous solutions.
 
Peace and Solidarity
 But there is also a desire to satisfy a more fundamental need.
"People need a place to go to pray, a sense of peace and they need the opportunity to express their sorrows," said the Rev. Eric Carpine, who leads the devotions at St. Francis of Assisi, on West 31st Street between Avenue of the Americas and Seventh Avenue. "They can look around and see others suffering. There is some solidarity that comes from that, and a great deal of strength."
Saints are seen by the faithful as people who led exemplary lives and have the ability to intercede with God.
"It's easier to approach a human person than it is to approach God directly," said the Rev. George Concordia, a Dominican friar in charge of the St. Jude shrine at St. Catherine of Siena Roman Catholic Church in Manhattan. "You have more empathy with a St. Jude. You identify with a human being."
Virginia, who would give only her first name, credited her prayers to St. Jude for her son's rapid recovery from an accident that had left him unconscious four years ago. She has attended the weekly prayer sessions at St. Francis ever since. "You've got to have faith; otherwise you couldn't go through it," she said. "People do have faith that things do get better. Even if it doesn't look that way."
The American Catholic tradition of devotion to St. Jude is relatively recent for a martyr who was both a relative and disciple of Jesus Christ. It began in 1929 when the Rev. James Tort, a member of the Claretian order, founded a shrine in honor of the saint at a Chicago church that attracted people who were struggling through unbearable economic times.
Robert Orsi, a professor of religious studies at Indiana University and the author of an upcoming book on American women's devotion to the saint, said it was then common to finance church buildings through devotions to a particular saint. In Chicago, the devotions helped to pay off a church debt and assisted in the financing of a seminary.
St. Jude had been somewhat obscure in this country partly because his identity was confused with that of Judas Iscariot, the disciple whom the New Testament said betrayed Christ. As an indication of the saint's marginal status, Mr. Orsi noted, in Chile Jude was considered the patron saint of prostitutes.
By choosing the relatively unheralded saint, Mr. Orsi said, Father Tort faced no competition from other religious orders with established devotions. Since then, other shrines have sprung up across the country, and smaller versions where a statue is placed in a church niche.
The devotion's American origins may be one reason for its enduring popularity, especially among the children of immigrants and non-Catholics, Mr. Orsi said. Unlike other saints, like Poland's Black Madonna or Mexico's Virgin of Guadalupe, St. Jude is not firmly identified with the religious experiences of any particular ethnic group. "Jude is attractive because he is not an ethnic saint," said Mr. Orsi. "Jude is really an Americanized saint."
St. Jude's association with impossible or lost causes has been somewhat harder to determine. Several priests whose parishes have shrines to the saint said that peoples' belief in St. Jude's ability to help them through extraordinarily difficult times stemmed partly from the very obscurity that had dogged St. Jude. His guilt by association, because his name was similar to that of Christ's betrayer, allowed people to relate their burdens to St. Jude's.
"It seems they believed that some of the worst needs were relegated to him because of his relationship to Christ," said the Rev. John Lemrise, the novena director at the Chicago shrine. "We are convinced that the grass roots discovered a quality they attributed to St. Jude."
 
Testimonies of Faithful
 The shrine's newsletter features testimonies from the faithful, who said their prayers had been responsible for recoveries from aneurysms and comas, for finding jobs and even for selling a house in a slow market.
Toni C., a songwriter and a recovering addict, offered her prayers at St. Francis for other addicts and their families. She said her devotion to St. Jude dated to her childhood, when her younger sister's paralysis from spinal meningitis was inexplicably relieved after her family prayed.
"Having a patron saint is like having a sponsor who looks out for you," she said.
Roy Davidson, who helps at services at St. Francis, said it was important to remember that prayers to the saints are asking for their intercession with God.
"It's good and healthy as long as they approach the devotion in the right frame of mind," said Mr. Davidson, who said he prayed to the saint a few years ago for the strength to cope with his companion's death. "It's like approaching a friend to ask a favor. I wouldn't approach him as I would approach God."
 
Long-Term Relationships
 Mr. Orsi said that the devotion has endured despite what he saw as a disdain among theologians and liturgists. "These guys think that relating to the sacred is awesome and unreachable except through the official teachings of the church," he said. "But lots of people found access to what they considered the holy through the saints. To enter into a relationship with Jude, in a desperate time, that is to enter a relationship that often lasts for decades."
Danny Thomas, the late entertainer, often said St. Jude had answered his prayers when his early career was sputtering. In thanks, Mr. Thomas was the moving force in establishing the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis.
The classified ads thanking the saint are viewed with mixed emotions by priests. While the ads spread knowledge of the saint and encourage others to pray to him, some priests feel the money spent on the ads could be better used on donations to soup kitchens or homeless shelters.
Some priests worry that the ads are part of an improvised religious tradition that in some extreme cases are more akin to superstition and send the wrong message about the devotion.
Indeed, some practices surrounding the devotion have been criticized as superstitious and as preying on people's fears, including the proliferation of a chain letter. It promises solutions to any problem in return for saying a prayer to St. Jude and other prayers over a nine-day period. It also asks the worshiper to leave nine copies of the letter inside a church each day.
Such practices reduce the devotion to an acquisitive exercise where a rote incantation to a saint possesses some magical power, said the Rev. James Gill, a psychiatrist and Jesuit.
 
'An Intermediary'
 "A solid piety knows it is God who does the deed and answers their prayers and the saint is only an intermediary," he said. "Those who are more superstitious will direct a plea to St. Jude, get what they want at times and not think beyond that. They don't attribute it so much to God but to the pull a saint has."
He added that even within the accepted forms of the devotion, people had to be careful in interpreting an answered prayer as a miracle. In strict terms, miracles are occurrences that transcend the laws of nature, not the marketplace. An unexpected cure from a terminal illness might qualify, happening upon a rent-controlled apartment would not.
Dr. Gill and other priests emphasized that prayers had to be not just for help with needs, but also for praise and thanksgiving, adding that without a deeper, well-rounded faith, the devotions would be empty.
Dennis O'Donnell has faith in the young people he works with as the head basketball coach at St. Thomas Aquinas College in Rockland County. He makes a regular "pilgrimage" to the city to offer his prayers to St. Jude on their behalf.
"I suppose the hardest thing in the world is for a young person to grow up and be good," he said. "It's just so easy for kids to get messed up."
Of course, some people think he's really praying for victory, although he insists that's not the reason. But he wouldn't mind that, either.
"We have been winning the past couple of years," he said, smiling. "I guess there's been some spillover."

The revolution in wireless communications took a new turn yesterday as an upstart company acquired the capstone for a nationwide network that could give cellular phone companies and giants like A.T.& T. a run for their money.
Capping a steady and often stealthy six-year buying binge, Nextel Communications Inc., of Rutherford, N.J., announced it would buy a huge collection of mobile-radio licenses from Motorola Inc. for $1.8 billion in stock. When combined with licenses that Nextel had already acquired, the company now has the potential -- theoretically at least -- to serve 180 million people across 21 states. 
 That is roughly three times the number of people covered by McCaw Cellular Communications, the nation's biggest cellular operator, which American Telephone and Telegraph is buying for $12.6 billion.
"We admit it, we are the skunk at the wireless picnic," said Morgan E. O'Brien, chairman of Nextel. "No one invited us."
Using digital technology to update old-fashioned taxicab radio services, Nextel officials say they hope to offer a sophisticated rival to cellular networks within three years. Besides carrying ordinary voice conversations, as cellular does, the new Nextel networks would offer built-in paging and data communications -- features not available with most current cellular service.
The company has already begun operating such a network in Los Angeles and expects to cover almost all of California by spring. In the metropolitan New York area, Nextel's service should be running by next summer.
Nextel officials also announced yesterday that Nippon Telegraph and Telephone , the Japanese telephone giant, would invest $75 million in the company and would design a nationwide signaling system to enable Nextel to link all its local systems into a single network within three years.
Despite Nextel's potential, made possible by a more than fourfold increase in the company's stock in the last year, the challenges ahead are enormous. For one thing, the existing cellular industry has a huge head start with roughly 12 million customers nationwide. Nextel would not be fully operational until at least 1996.
Moreover Nextel, despite having raised more than $1 billion in working capital during the last two years, will also need a lot of additional financing. Brian D. McAuley, Nextel's president, estimated that Nextel's initial construction costs would total $1.2 billion.
Beyond that, the company will need hundreds of millions of dollars to cover marketing and operations. Industry analysts estimate that cellular companies incur marketing costs of $500 to sign up each customer, and some predict Nextel will have to spend $650 a customer because its equipment and service is not as familiar.
Currently, Nextel has about $400 million in cash from recent stock and junk-bond offerings, and $520 million in credit from Motorola, which supplies Nextel's network equipment. Mr. McAuley has made it clear the company will be raising extra money, either from the public markets or from investment partners.
But Nextel is well positioned to raise money on the strength of its stock, which has soared from a low of $9 last year to the mid-40's recently. Nasdaq trading in Nextel's stock was temporarily halted yesterday morning after the company made its announcement. When trading resumed, the shares soared $5 to more than $51 each, a record, before easing back to close at $47.25, up $1.25 for the day.
Money could come from some of its current partners, like the Comcast Corporation, a Philadelphia-based company with extensive holdings in cable television, cellular and other communications services. Comcast has already invested $300 million, and it holds options to buy shares at $16. Exercising those options would bring Nextel $400 million, Mr. McAuley said.
But the company faces obstacles besides money. Nextel telephones are currently bulkier and more expensive than comparable cellular phones. And company officials acknowledge that they cannot yet economically compete for low-budget consumers who spend only $50 a month on cellular service. At least initially, the company plans to focus on business customers who want both cellular service and more traditional fleet-radio services.
 
A Credible Player
 Nevertheless, Nextel has clearly emerged as a credible player in the wireless wars. Its biggest advantage is that it and the other big "radio dispatch" carriers like Cencall Communications of Denver and Dialpage Inc. of Greenville, S.C., will all use the same digital technology developed by Motorola. That should make it much easier for these companies' subscribers to use the same telephone when they travel to different cities, and for the carriers to serve one another's traveling customers.
By contrast, the cellular industry is now divided among at least three different technologies. One is the traditional analog system in which sounds are transmitted in the form of waves. The other two are dueling digital technologies, each of which can greatly increase the capacity of a cellular network and is expected to improve sound quality. The cellular industry is split over which of the two digital technologies is better, while many smaller companies are reluctant to spend the money to move beyond the older analog systems,
Nextel, meanwhile, may be able to get a jump on companies developing "personal communication services," or P.C.S., a broad family of new wireless services that will use a huge block of the airwaves that the Federal Communications Commission opened up last month.
Most of these new services will not be up and running for at least three years, because the F.C.C. will not even begin handing out licenses until it starts auctioning them off next June. Many industry experts say the F.C.C. has also doomed the fledgling P.C.S. industry to fragmentation by electing not to offer any nationwide licenses, deciding instead to offer more than 2,500 regional licenses.
Nextel may benefit directly from the P.C.S. rules. The F.C.C. placed strict limits on the ability of cellular telephone companies to bid for the new licenses, because it was afraid cellular companies would stifle new rivals. But it placed no limit on companies like Nextel, which can now bid on P.C.S. licenses to fill out any remaining blank spots in their holdings.
Many analysts had been expecting a deal like the one announced today, in which Motorola is selling Nextel hundreds of licenses in 21 states. Nextel had recently been on a frenzied acquisition campaign, expanding its portfolio of properties. And it had cemented agreements with other big operators of mobile-radio services to help create a national market by using the same technology as Nextel.
Motorola, which has been the nation's largest operator of these so-called "specialized mobile radio" services, had already sold off a big chunk of its holdings to two other companies similar to Nextel, Cencall and Dialpage.
Motorola, the world's largest maker of cellular and paging equipment, developed the technology being used by Nextel.

HEADLINE: A Satisfactory Marriage;
Many Economists See Boon to Competition In Merger of Cable and Phone Companies

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
The proposed $32 billion merger of Bell Atlantic and Tele-Communications may turn out to be not only the biggest deal yet, but also one of the most scrutinized.
The Justice Department, the Federal Communications Commission and a host of Congressional committees are all expected to weigh in. Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, the Ohio Democrat whose Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust policy held hearings last month on the merger of the giant regional phone company and the nation's largest cable television conglomerate, has attacked the deal as a "double whammy for consumers," a mega-monster that will raise both phone and cable prices. 
 Many economists, by contrast, seem almost sanguine about the proposed combination. While they acknowledge that a merger of this magnitude in so important an industry merits a close look, few share Senator Metzenbaum's concerns. "If they spin off T.C.I.'s cable companies in Bell Atlantic's own phone territory, I just don't see any anticompetitive aspects," said Robert Crandall of the Brookings Institution.
Peter Pitsch, a former adviser to the F.C.C., thinks the merger could actually stimulate competition. "The new company," he predicts, "could give local telephone monopolies a run for their money in wireless voice communications."
Economists generally expect free markets to discipline themselves; if one producer charges excessively, it will attract other sellers and drive down prices. But because it was assumed there was really only the need (or room) for one set of telephone lines, communications policy has long been aimed at letting a local phone company operate as a protected franchise and then closely regulating its prices and performance.
The catch is that even under the best circumstances, regulation can only approximate the outcome of competitive markets. And as technology has made it possible to carry voice or video in many different ways -- on different kinds of wire or even beamed without wire -- the neat market boundaries have evaporated, making it ever more problematic that the waste associated with unchecked private market power would exceed the waste linked to less than omniscient regulation. For many economists, in fact, the far greater worry today is that Government control will retard technological change or distort it to favor entrenched interests.
It is still easy to see why the alarm bells are ringing in Washington. the Bell Atlantic Corporation alone provides a dial tone for 18 million phones and operates cellular systems with 800,000 customers. Tele-Communications Inc. serves 13 million cable subscribers and has a big stake in video programming, owning chunks of the Turner Broadcasting System, the Discovery Channel and the Liberty Media Corporation. What is more, Tele-Communications' chief executive, John C. Malone, has never been shy about exploiting a new opportunity.
But Alfred E. Kahn, the last chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board and a father of the deregulation movement, points out that sheer size and aggressiveness are poor yardsticks of a corporation's market power. What counts is the capacity to manipulate the price of services bought and sold at the expense of customers, suppliers or competitors. How one views this merger, he suggests, should depend on how one expects the market for telecommunications services to evolve.
 
The Competitive Shootout
 The seven unregulated parent companies of the regulated local telephone carriers have campaigned for years for the right to offer cable video services to their phone customers -- a right denied them under the 1982 judicial decree breaking up A.T.& T. The idea, which seemed reasonable at the time, was that the sale of unregulated services would generate insurmountable conflicts of interest for local phone monopolies.
By the same token, cable companies have been itching to compete in the portion of the telephone market now dominated by the local Bells. And while some can and do provide specialized data communications to businesses, they have yet to obtain permission from state regulators or make the investment in switching equipment needed to operate a local telephone network.
Many analysts had expected that if the regulatory obstacles were removed, the two forms of communications networks would eventually engage in a bitter battle to sell an array of advanced services ranging from picture phones to catalogue shopping to movies on demand.
At first glance then, a merger of a big cable company and a big phone company seems to upset the prospects for a competitive shootout in which consumers are guaranteed to be the winners. But hardly anything is so simple in the rapidly changing, technologically driven market for telecommunications.
One complication, argues Leland Johnson, an economist who recently retired from the Rand Corporation, is that the two kinds of communications networks are not really competitive equals. The coaxial cable used by cable television gives the cable companies an enormous advantage now because it has far more capacity to carry information than the pair of copper wires currently used to link most phones.
In fact, coaxial cable may be sufficient to provide the first generation of interactive video services, leaving potential competitors from the telephone side of the market with the difficult choice of leap-frogging the cable operators by investing in super-expensive fiber-optic links to homes or leaving the field of battle.
 
A New Class of Competition
 Mr. Pitsch, the former F.C.C. adviser, notes that another complication is that it is far from clear that the primary challenge to cable's video services will come from competing wire networks, like the phone companies, or that challenges to local phone companies' voice and data transmission will come from cable. There may well be yet more competition from companies that transmit signals with no wires at all; satellites, for example, could be used to broadcast video direct to homes and wireless phones may go head to head with the wired networks.
In fact, direct broadcast service with the potential for more than 100 interference-free channels is scheduled to begin next year. To make such a service interactive, however, users would have to send messages back to the broadcaster by ordinary phone lines.
Moreover, the cable networks may never go into the wired phone business because their main competitive chance lies elsewhere. Mr. Pitsch points out that tiny, wireless phones may have significant cost advantages over conventional wired networks. And he says existing cable systems may prove the perfect match for the new technology, accommodating the thousands of transmission "nodes" a personal communications system would need to operate within a single large city.
In any case, Bell Atlantic is not about to concede that the merger would reduce competition, even if one discounts the prospects for a new generation of wireless video and phone services. Jim Smith, a spokesman for the company, points out that a combined Bell Atlantic-Tele-Communications would sell off all its local cable systems in the states where Bell Atlantic now operates wired phone networks. "How can it be anticompetitive," Mr. Smith asks, for Bell Atlantic to provide the cash and technical expertise to speed the enhancement of T.C.I.'s plain-vanilla video cable systems.
This is not quite the last word in the debate, however. By being first, it is at least plausible that Bell Atlantic and Tele-Communications could discourage local phone companies from going into the interactive video business themselves.
That assumes, of course, that the regional Bells would otherwise be able to surmount the technological and financial hurdles of converting existing phone networks into information superhighways. Rapid enhancement of Tele-Communications' cable systems might also lock up millions of customers for the expensive new video services, deterring investment in direct-broadcast satellites.
But Mr. Pitsch is not impressed by such scenarios. Telecommunications are changing so rapidly and the difficulty of predicting winning and losing technologies is so great, he argues, that Washington would be foolish to second-guess those willing to take big risks in search of big profits. "I'm glad it's Bell Atlantic's money, not mine," he says.
What does worry many economists is a less-noticed potential bottleneck to competition: the cost of producing programming is so great today and the audience so fragmented, says David Waterman, an economist at the University of Indiana, that new cable channels need access to every home they can get. Thus a big cable system -- notably Tele-Communications Inc., which already has a hammerlock on the cables serving one home in four -- can extract the best possible terms from program producers.
The issue gets even stickier if -- as is the case with Tele-Communications Inc. -- the cable system already has a substantial investment in the programming business. How, for example, should one expect Tele-Communications to respond to the formation of another all-news network when it owns a chunk of CNN through its investment in Turner Broadcasting?
But Tele-Communications' share of the total cable market is smaller than the maximum 30 percent permitted by the F.C.C. If that share were deemed anticompetitive, the commission (or Congress) could always reduce it. In any case, Mr. Waterman allows, this potential for discriminating against programmers would not be increased by union with Bell Atlantic.
"The merger probably won't make telecommunications less competitive," Mr. Johnson cautiously concludes. "And it may make it more competitive."

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Supreme Court Ruling on Sexual Harassment in Workplace

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 9

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the Supreme Court's ruling today on sexual harassment in the workplace. The Court ruled unamimously that workers suing their employers for sexual harassment need not show that they suffered psychological injury. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote the opinion, Harris v. Forklift systems. While joining the opinion, Justices Antonin Scalia and Ruth Bader Ginsburg also filed separate concurring opinions.
 
BY JUSTICE O'CONNOR,
For the Court
 In this case we consider the definition of a discriminatorily "abusive work environment" (also known as a "hostile work environment") under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 
 Teresa Harris worked as a manager at Forklift Systems, Inc., an equipment rental company, from April 1985 until October 1987. Charles Hardy was Forklift's president.
The magistrate found that, throughout Harris's time at Forklift, Hardy often insulted her because of her gender and often made her the target of unwanted sexual innuendos. Hardy told Harris on several occasions, in the presence of other employees, "You're a woman, what do you know" and, "We need a man as the rental manager;" at least once, he told her she was "a dumb ass woman." Again in front of others, he suggested that the two of them "go to the Holiday Inn to negotiate (Harris's) raise." Hardy occasionally asked Harris and other female employees to get coins from his front pants pocket. He threw objects on the ground in front of Harris and other women, and asked them to pick the objects up. He made sexual innuendos about Harris's and other women's clothing.
In mid-August 1987, Harris complained to Hardy about his conduct. Hardy said he was surprised that Harris was offended, claimed he was only joking, and apologized. He also promised he would stop, and based on this assurance Harris stayed on the job. But in early September, Hardy began anew: While Harris was arranging a deal with one of Forklift's customers, he asked her, again in front of other employees, "What did you do, promise the guy . . . some (sex) Saturday night?" On Oct. 1, Harris collected her paycheck and quit.
Harris then sued Forklift, claiming that Hardy's conduct had created an abusive work environment for her because of her gender. The United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, adopting the report and recommendation of the magistrate, found this to be "a close case," but held that Hardy's conduct did not create an abusive environment. The court found that some of Hardy's comments "offended (Harris), and would offend the reasonable woman," but that they were not "so severe as to be expected to seriously affect (Harris's) psychological well-being. A reasonable woman manager under like circumstances would have been offended by Hardy, but his conduct would not have risen to the level of interfering with that person's work performance.
"Neither do I believe that (Harris) was subjectively so offended that she suffered injury . . . . Although Hardy may at times have genuinely offended (Harris), I do not believe that he created a working environment so poisoned as to be intimidating or abusive to (Harris)."
 
Conflict Among Circuits
 In focusing on the employee's psychological well-being, the District Court was following Circuit precedent. See Rabidue v. Osceola Refining Co. (CA6 1986). The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed in a brief unpublished decision.
We granted certiorari, to resolve a conflict among the circuits on whether conduct, to be actionable as "abusive work environment" harassment (no quid pro quo harassment issue is present here), must "seriously affect (an employee's) psychological well-being" or lead the plaintiff to "suffe(r) injury." . . .
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 makes it "an unlawful employment practice for an employer . . . to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin." As we made clear in Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, (1986), this language "is not limited to 'economic' or 'tangible' discrimination. The phrase 'terms, conditions, or privileges of employment' evinces a Congressional intent 'to strike at the entire spectrum of disparate treatment of men and women' in employment," which includes requiring people to work in a discriminatorily hostile or abusive environment. When the workplace is permeated with "discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult," that is "sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive working environment," Title VII is violated.
This standard, which we reaffirm today, takes a middle path between making actionable any conduct that is merely offensive and requiring the conduct to cause a tangible psychological injury. As we pointed out in Meritor, "mere utterance of an . . . epithet which engenders offensive feelings in a employee," does not sufficiently affect the conditions of employment to implicate Title VII. Conduct that is not severe or pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment, an environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive, is beyond Title VII's purview. Likewise, if the victim does not subjectively perceive the environment to be abusive, the conduct has not actually altered the conditions of the victim's employment, and there is no Title VII violation.
 
Effects on Performance
 But Title VII comes into play before the harassing conduct leads to a nervous breakdown. A discriminatorily abusive work environment, even one that does not seriously affect employees' psychological well-being, can and often will detract from employees' job performance, discourage employees from remaining on the job, or keep them from advancing in their careers. Moreover, even without regard to these tangible effects, the very fact that the discriminatory conduct was so severe or pervasive that it created a work environment abusive to employees because of their race, gender, religion, or national origin offends Title VII's broad rule of workplace equality. The appalling conduct alleged in Meritor, and the reference in that case to environments " 'so heavily polluted with discrimination as to destroy completely the emotional and psychological stability of minority group workers,' " merely present some especially egregious examples of harassment. They do not mark the boundary of what is actionable.
We therefore believe the District Court erred in relying on whether the conduct "seriously affect(ed) plaintiff's psychological well-being" or led her to "suffe(r) injury." Such an inquiry may needlessly focus the factfinder's attention on concrete psychological harm, an element Title VII does not require. Certainly Title VII bars conduct that would seriously affect a reasonable person's psychological well-being, but the statute is not limited to such conduct. So long as the environment would reasonably be perceived, and is perceived, as hostile or abusive, there is no need for it also to be psychologically injurious.
This is not, and by its nature cannot be, a mathematically precise test. We need not answer today all the potential questions it raises, nor specifically address the E.E.O.C.'s new regulations on this subject. But we can say that whether an environment is "hostile" or "abusive" can be determined only by looking at all the circumstances. These may include the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance. The effect on the employee's psychological well-being is, of course, relevant to determining whether the plaintiff actually found the environment abusive. But while psychological harm, like any other relevant factor, may be taken into account, no single factor is required.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
BY JUSTICE SCALIA,
 Concurring
 Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, held that Title VII prohibits sexual harassment that takes the form of a hostile work environment. The Court stated that sexual harassment is actionable if it is "sufficiently severe or pervasive 'to alter the conditions of (the victim's) employment and create an abusive work environment.' " Today's opinion elaborates that the challenged conduct must be severe or pervasive enough "to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment, an environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive." Ante, at 4.
"Abusive" (or "hostile," which in this context I take to mean the same thing) does not seem to me a very clear standard and I do not think clarity is at all increased by adding the adverb "objectively" or by appealing to a "reasonable person's" notion of what the vague word means. Today's opinion does list a number of factors that contribute to abusiveness, but since it neither says how much of each is necessary (an impossible task) nor identifies any single factor as determinative, it thereby adds little certitude. As a practical matter, today's holding lets virtually unguided juries decide whether sex-related conduct engaged in (or permitted by) an employer is egregious enough to warrant an award of damages.
One might say that what constitutes "negligence" (a traditional jury question) is not much more clear and certain than what constitutes "abusiveness." Perhaps so. But the class of plaintiffs seeking to recover for negligence is limited to those who have suffered harm, whereas under this statute "abusiveness" is to be the test of whether legal harm has been suffered, opening more expansive vistas of litigation.
Be that as it may, I know of no alternative to the course the Court today has taken. . . . .
 
BY JUSTICE GINSBURG,
 Concurring
 Today the Court reaffirms the holding of Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, "(A) plaintiff may establish a violation of Title VII by proving that discrimination based on sex has created a hostile or abusive work environment." The critical issue, Title VII's text indicates, is whether members of one sex are exposed to disadvantageous terms or conditions of employment to which members of the other sex are not exposed. As the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission emphasized, see Brief for United States and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission as amici curiae, the adjudicator's inquiry should center, dominantly, on whether the discriminatory conduct has unreasonably interfered with the plaintiff's work performance. To show such interference, "the plaintiff need not prove that his or her tangible productivity has declined as a result of the harassment." It suffices to prove that a reasonable person subjected to the discriminatory conduct would find, as the plaintiff did, that the harassment so altered working conditions as to "ma(k)e it more difficult to do the job."
Davis concerned race-based discrimination, but that difference does not alter the analysis; except in the rare case in which a bona fide occupational qualification is shown, see Automobile Workers v. Johnson Controls, Inc., Title VII declares discriminatory practices based on race, gender, religion, or national origin equally unlawful. (Footnote 1)

 	 	 		. . .	 	Footnote 1. Indeed, even under the Court's equal protection jurisprudence, which requires an exceedingly persuasive justification for a gender-based classification, Kirchberg v. Feenstra (1981), it remains an open question whether classifications based upon gender are inherently suspect. See Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, (1982).

HEADLINE: Fears on Nafta Lower Peso

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Nov. 9

 BODY:
The Mexican currency fell sharply today as foreign investors pulled out money amid jitters over the prospects for approval in the United States of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The new peso declined 15 centavos against the dollar, to trade at 3.30 pesos in early dealings before firming later in the day to close at 3.27, down about 4 percent. 
 The funds have reportedly been withdrawing as much as $1 billion a day since last week, and this prompted Mexico's central bank to raise interest rates to stem the tide.
However, a senior Mexican official, who was not identified by name, said there was nothing to worry about and scotched any idea of a devaluation. "Has there been a devaluation?" the official said. "Absolutely false. There's nothing to it. This is all within the normal range."
Some investors fear that the trade agreement, widely known as Nafta, will be defeated by the United States House of Representatives in its vote next Wednesday. This, they fear, would dash hopes for a quick economic stimulus in Mexico and for a time depress Mexican stock and bond prices. Analysts and traders said $4 billion to $5 billion have poured out of Mexico since the weekend as investors tried to limit their exposure in pesos.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Refunding Wavers a Bit

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The Treasury struggled a bit in the first leg of its quarterly refunding auctions yesterday, even though the latest report on inflation was unexpectedly good.
Bidding for the $17 billion worth of new three-year notes sold yesterday was somewhat ragged, traders said, and the securities sold at an average yield of 4.44 percent. It is the lowest yield on a three-year note since the May 11 auction, when the average yield was 4.27 percent. 
 In addition to the three-year notes, the Treasury also sold $14 billion worth of 66-day cash management bills at an average yield of 3.16 percent.
 
Three-Year Note Auction
 Before the three-year note auction, yields on the new securities dipped as low as 4.41 percent, as traders reacted to the Government report showing that wholesale prices fell by two-tenths of a percent last month.
The report on the Producer Price Index took the market by surprise, and the yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond fell to 6.14 percent, from 6.19 percent on Monday. Treasury yields have been rising in recent weeks on signs that the economy is strengthening, which could reignite inflation.
October's decline in producer prices was partly a result of a steep 3.9 percent drop in automobile prices. Many analysts had expected the Producer Price Index to rise by two-tenths to three-tenths of a percent.
Despite the steep drop in the automobile component, the overall decline "wasn't totally illusory," said Steven A. Wood, director of financial markets research at BA Securities Inc. in San Francisco.
"A substantial proportion came from the car sector, but there was weakness elsewhere in the report," he said. "Producers have been having difficult times putting through any price increases for the last couple of years, and they still are."
The three-year auction will be followed today by the sale of $12 billion worth of new 10-year notes. That auction will close out the autumn refunding, which is unusual this year because the Treasury does not intend to sell new 30-year bonds.
The change reflects the shift in the Treasury's approach to debt management announced in May, one that places more emphasis on shorter-term securities and less on longer-term issues. The Treasury will not sell any new 30-year bonds until its winter refunding in February.
This is the first time that the Government has voluntarily held refunding without bond in slightly more than two decades.
Unless a report due this morning on consumer prices is much worse than current expectations, traders said they expect the auction of 10-year notes will go well.
"Since the Treasury changed the supply schedule, and since the Fed isn't about to ease monetary policy, there is no real reason, either technically or fundamentally, to buy the short end," one trader said.
"But the long end is an entirely different story. Inflation is low, the yield curve is steep, and there is no supply as you go out the curve. After the 10-year auction, I would expect the long sector will outperform the world."
In when-issued trading late yesterday, the new 10-year notes were offered at a price to yield 5.63 percent.
Because the increase in Federal gasoline taxes went into effect in October, most analysts are forecasting that the Consumer Price Index to be released this morning will be up by about four-tenths of 1 percent. Excluding the volatile food and energy sectors, however, the closely watched index is expected to post a more modest rise of around one-tenth of 1 percent.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, bonds benefited most from the good news on producer prices. By late in the day, the 6 1/4 percent bonds of 2023 were offered at a price of 101 17/32 , up 25/32 from late Monday, to yield 6.14 percent. In hectic trading following the producer price report, bond prices jumped by more than a point.
Reaction among shorter-term securities was much more muted. Prices of the Treasury's 4 3/4 percent five-year notes rose by just 3/32 , to a late offered price of 98 30/32 , to yield 4.99 percent. And prices of the 3 7/8 percent two-year notes were unchanged, at 99 19/32 , to yield 4.09 percent.
In other developments, an offering of $823 million worth of securities from the New York City Municipal Water Finance Authority highlighted activity in the tax-exempt municipal bond market.
Term bonds maturing in 2019 represented the biggest part of the multi-part issue. These 5.50 percent securities were priced to yield 5.73 percent.
Investment bankers at Smith Barney Shearson, lead managers on the underwriting, said the issue, which was increased in size from $750 million, was selling well. By late yesterday, they said about $100 million worth of securities remained unsold.
The issue is rated A by Moody's Investors Service and A- by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
 
Corporate Bond Market
 In the corporate bond market, U S West Communications priced $250 million worth of debentures with a final maturity in 50 years. The maturity is a bit misleading, because the issue can be called in 20 years.
The 7 1/8 percent securities were priced at $99.269, to yield 7.179 percent, 85 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 1/8 percent 30-year bonds maturing in February, 2023.
Merrill Lynch & Company acted as lead manager for the underwriting. The issue is rated AA-3 by Moody's and AA- by Standard & Poor's.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Posts Broad Gains While Gold Also Advances

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar rose against most currencies yesterday, despite a two-tenths of 1 percent drop in October producer prices that pointed to lower interest rates and inflation.
"It was a surprising day in some respects," said Bruce English, head of institutional sales for ABN/AMRO N.V. "I would've expected the dollar to fall on the P.P.I., but bulls maintain inflation is still a problem no matter what the short-term indexes say." 
 The dollar normally loses value as United States interest rates decline, because dollar deposits earn less money as rates fall. But some dealers said the currency rose as the market reassessed the data to view low inflation as positive for the dollar longer term.
"If rates were to go higher in response to inflation, the dollar would go higher because it would attract money from overseas," said Michael Martin, vice president at the Sinclair Group, "But a long-term inflationary picture hurts the buying power of the dollar," he said.
Mr. English noted some dollar buying was related to concerns about the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement, ahead of a televised debate last night between Vice President Al Gore and Ross Perot.
"If Nafta is not passed, it will have a slight inflationary impact on the U.S.," he said.
In late New York trading, the dollar rose to 1.6925 German marks, from 1.6843 marks on Monday. It also edged up to 107.95 Japanese yen from 107.80 yen.
Meanwhile, gold prices rose. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for December delivery gained $1.10, to $376.60 an ounce.
The dollar traded in a narrow range against the yen, caught between Japanese exporter sell orders at 108.30 yen and good buying beneath the market at 107.50 to 107.80 yen.
Nagging concerns about Japan's huge trade gap with the United States continued to brake the dollar's gains, dealers said.
Trading remained cautious ahead of the release of more inflation data today, when the Government reports the Consumer Price Index for October.
Many economists are maintaining their forecasts for October consumer prices despite the drop in producer prices. On average, economists forecast the Consumer Price Index to rise four-tenths of 1 percent, while the so-called core rate is seen up two-tenths of 1 percent.
The British pound slipped to $1.4685 in New York trading, from $1.4810 on Monday.

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Fell In October

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 9

 BODY:
Prices received by American producers declined two-tenths of 1 percent in October, surprisingly strong reassurance that a pickup in the economy is not reviving inflation, Labor Department figures showed today.
Except for a modest rise in September, prices for finished goods have fallen or been unchanged every month since April and "core" inflation -- with energy and food excluded -- has all but disappeared over the last 12 months. 
 "This report underscores the fact that inflation still looks like it's declining," commented William C. Dudley, senior economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company. He said it probably "cinches the argument" that the Federal Reserve would avoid even positioning itself to tighten credit when its main policy-making arm meets next week.
 
 
Bond Prices Jump
 Bond prices surged on news of lower producer prices, driving down interest rates. [Page D16.] Most economists had expected a small increase in prices, mainly reflecting what turned out to be the biggest jump for energy since February.
But food prices declined five-tenths of a point and the finished-goods index benefited greatly from a 3.9 percent drop in the price of new cars. As part of its process of adjustment for recurring seasonal variations, the department calculated that quality improvements averaged $310.96 a car, or 46.5 percent of the $668.80 yearly increase that car makers received.
The retail equivalent of these changes averaged $363.63, about half for air bags and the rest involving powertrains, corrosion protection, emissions, side-impact standards and changes in amounts of standard or optional equipment.
Before seasonal adjustment, passenger car prices climbed 5 percent for the month.
 
 
'Lot of Excess Capacity'
 Inflation was also well contained at the intermediate stage of production, where prices edged down one-tenth of 1 percent last month. Crude goods posted a 1.4 percent increase but would have declined without the surge in oil prices, which has now been reversed.
"Inflation should be well behaved" for a considerable period, said Patrick J. Corcoran, economist for the Prudential Insurance Company. "We've got lots of excess capacity in the United States economy."
Laurence H. Meyer, a St. Louis consultant, concurred. He noted that the Producer Price Index rose just one-tenth of 1 percent without the benefit of the restraining automobile component and said today's report "should calm inflationary fears which have been brewing on a host of strong economic reports" over the last two weeks.
So far this year, prices for finished goods -- those ready for sale to the consumer or final business user -- have advanced at a rate of just four-tenths of 1 percent, the best performance since the Producer Price Index posted a rare decline in 1986 with the collapse in oil prices.
The Producer Price Index, however, does not include imported goods, most services or taxes. The Consumer Price Index, which does cover these items, is expected to show a modest increase when it is published Wednesday, perhaps half the rise resulting from the 4.3-cent Federal gasoline tax that took effect Oct. 1.
Prices for the core Producer Price Index last month fell five-tenths of 1 percent after showing no change in September, today's survey also found, meaning that most companies are finding it nearly impossible to impose price increases.
 
 
'Competed Away'
 The cost reductions obtained through restructurings are being "competed away" in a ferocious market, declared Mr. Dudley of Goldman, Sachs.
At Greer Industries in Morgantown, W. Va., Thomas Buck, the controller, said the company had managed only "very, very slight" price increases for its sand, gravel and concrete over the last six months.
Today's report showed a 1.3 percent rise in energy that resulted from jumps of 6.3 percent for gasoline and 5.5 percent for home heating oil, partly offset by a 2.3 percent decline for residential natural gas. But finished foods reversed a September rise to decline five-tenths of 1 percent on lower prices for beef and veal and fresh fruits and vegetables.
Capital equipment eased four-tenths of 1 percent as computer prices and motor vehicles fell in price while civilian aircraft rose sharply.
Among intermediate goods, metals and other durables for manufacturing fell four-tenths of 1 percent while factory nondurables, such as chemicals, fell six-tenths of 1 percent. In both cases the declines exceeded September's.
Construction materials, however, rose five-tenths of 1 percent following a September advance of seven-tenths of 1 percent.
The Producer Price Index for total domestic manufacturing, which includes petroleum refining, climbed eight-tenths of 1 percent in October, the report also showed. This was the first increase since May.

HEADLINE: Gorky Stars as Auctions Resume

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
The market for contemporary art at auction is facing its own sort of Catch-22. The audience is there and eager to buy; the only problem is finding good material to sell. At a tepid auction at Christie's last night, art sold at every price level, even relatively insignificant art. Of the 62 works offered, 50 found buyers. The evening's sale totaled $15.9 million, just above Christie's low estimate of $15.3 million.
"I was mightily relieved and pleased that there was so much activity," said Christopher Burge, president of Christie's in New York. "We saw more bidding on less valuable works than we have in the past." 
 Eli Broad, a Los Angeles collector, said after the sale: "This was not an exciting sale. If they had first-rate material, they'd have more buyers."
The sale reflected more conservative offerings than Christie's has had in recent seasons, with works mostly from before 1980 and a strong emphasis on classical Abstract Expressionist work. There were also few pricey paintings; only three pictures were expected to bring $1 million or more.
Final prices for works bought before 1993 reflect the buyer's commission, which was then 10 percent and is now 15 percent of the first $50,000 and 10 percent of the rest. The estimates do not include commissions.
 
Gorky Sells;, Twombly Doesn't
 By far, the star work was Gorky's "Year After Year" (1947), sold by Gifford Phillips, a New York collector who is a trustee of the Museum of Modern Art. The lush, beautifully colored abstract painting was estimated at $3 million to $4 million. It sold to an unidentified American collector for $3.8 million, a record for the artist.
Another big-ticket painting's failure to sell became the evening's surprise. Cy Twombly's "Untitled (New York City)," from 1969, a blackboard painting with spiraling scrawls in chalk on a gray background, had been expected to fetch $1.8 million to $2.2 million, but bidding stopped at $1.5 million.
The third high-price work, Jackson Pollock's "No. 26, 1951," a black-and-white abstract painting, was estimated at $800,000 to $1 million. It was sold to Larry Gagosian, the New York dealer, for $827,500.
Francis Bacon's "Study for Portrait of Lucien Freud" (1964), estimated at $700,000 to $900,000 had many would-be takers. After a lengthy bidding war, it was sold to an unidentified telephone bidder for $1.7 million.
Throughout this fall auction season, many works that were up for sale just a year or two ago have reappeared, but with far lower estimates. Frank Stella's "Kingsbury Run" (first version), from 1961, was last up for sale at Christie's in November 1991, with an estimate of $2 million to $2.5 million, but bidding never went higher than $1.1 million. Last night, it was for sale again, this time with an estimate of $550,000 to $750,000. The painting was sold to an unidentifed bidder for $662,500, right in the middle of its estimate.
Calder, is one artist whose work has seemed almost recession-proof in the last few rough years, and last night was no exception. In fact, two of the three Calders for sale last night were among the auction's top 10 sellers.
The most important Calder, "Fish," a mobile circa 1942, was expected to bring $300,000 to $400,000. Seven years ago, it was up for sale, also at Christie's in New York, with an estimated of $65,000 to $85,000. Then it sold for $187,000; last night it brought $376,500. Another Calder, "Mobile with Eight Elements" (1948), estimated at $105,000, was sold to David Nahmed, a New York dealer, for $118,000. An untitled 1948 Calder with an estimate of $250,000 to $300,000 was sold to an unidentified telephone bidder for $277,500.
Another artist who fared well was Morris Louis. His "No. 25" (1962), estimated at $120,000 and $180,000, was sold to an unidentified bidder for $255,500. The artist's "Beta Tau" (1961) also sold to a telephone bidder for more than its high estimate of $300,000, bringing $354,500. "Pretty and decorative things sold, especially Color Field artists," said Lorinda Ash of the Gagosian Gallery. "There seemed to be new bidders, a different group than in the past."
The auction house confirmed that it had seen many new buyers, but there were many familiar faces in the audience as well. Stefan Edlis, a Chicago collector, bought Claes Oldenburg's "Stockinged Thighs Framed by Skirt" (1961), estimated at $150,000 to $200,000. Mr. Edlis paid $167,500. Several dealers were also buying, among them Laura Carpenter from Santa Fe, N.M., and Paula Cooper, the SoHo dealer.
Two artists who are currently having major retrospectives, Robert Ryman and Roy Lichtenstein, were represented last night. Mr. Ryman's "Marker" (1988), estimated at $120,000 to $180,000, brought $134,500. Several determined phone bidders fought over Mr. Lichtenstein's "Still Life With Coffee Pot" (1976), estimated at $200,000 to $250,000. After two bidders slowly climbed by $5,000 increments, it finally sold for $211,500. A Lichtenstein "Portrait" (1986), estimated at $140,000 to $180,000, sold above its high estimate, bringing $200,500.
One of the evening's tensest moments came when bidding began for Robert Artschwager's "Train Wreck" (1967). The work, estimated at $60,000 to $80,000, brought out a host of collectors in the salesroom who bid and bid hard. The painting finally sold for $222,500, almost three times its estimate.
But the Artschwager was an exception. For the most part, works sold within their estimates. "We've been at this level long enough," said Diane Upright, the head of contemporary art at Christie's, referring to the fact that prices are now where they were in early 1988. "It seemed both buyers and sellers were accepting the price levels."

HEADLINE: NEW YORK CITY MARATHON;
After 9,319-Mile Run, 26.2 Should Be a Mere Stroll

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN

 BODY:
As Japan's Demon Drummers sprinted the final yards in Central Park yesterday, completing a three-year, 9,319-mile run around the perimeter of the United States, Sunday's New York City Marathon promised to be less a torturous race than a stroll down the driveway for the morning paper.
"After this, only 26 miles will seem like dessert," said Marco Lienhard, 31, a Swiss-born member of the drum troupe, known in Japan as Ondekoza, which will play Carnegie Hall on Dec. 3. "A treat." 
 The nine arriving runners had been through 28 states, 125 pairs of shoes, countless knee strains, untold cartons of aspirin and analgesic rub, running an average of 20 miles a day and as many as 40, arriving at the finish line of their odyssey only to prepare for another run. The idea made the two-time New York winner, Tom Fleming, wince, as if he had pulled a muscle.
 
'A Serious Disease'
 "It's a serious disease," Fleming said with a laugh yesterday. "There should be medicine for that."
Takayasu Den, 62 years old, who founded the drum troupe in 1969, smiled and admitted through a translator that, yes, running the perimeter of the United States was "abnormal." After all, he was wearing socks and comfortable thongs on his feet, not a pair of running shoes that had been on tour longer than the Grateful Dead.
But, Den added, what better way to collect a mental scrapbook of the United States than to run the country instead of traversing it in the steel tube of an airplane or the five-speed isolation of a car?
"Many people have run across the United States," Den said. "But no one has run around it."
 
'Fulfilling My Dream'
 The idea was to see American cities, big and small, spreading the tradition of Ondekoza music with its throbbing 700-pound barrel drums and whispering bamboo flutes. In return, the drummers would learn something about the United States and themselves. Den had experienced America through its movies -- "I was born in 1931, same as James Dean" -- yet the country had seemed like a mannequin, draped out in finery but artificial on the flat screen. Now, it would come to full life in person.
"I wanted to run, but I couldn't," Den said. "These young people are fulfilling my dream."
Thirteen runners, age 15 to 29, set out from New York on Nov. 15, 1990, and ran down the East Coast to Miami, across the Deep South and Texas to Phoenix and Los Angeles, up the West Coast to Seattle, across the Great Plains toward Minneapolis, Chicago, Cleveland and finally, back to New York, skipping only an excursion to Boston in order to be here for Sunday's marathon.
They ran on small highways, avoiding the interstates except when it was impossible in Yuma, Ariz., and parts of Southern California. The drummers stayed on a ranch in Sulphur Springs, Mont., bunked in a church in Roundup, Mont., and otherwise bivouacked in schools, tents, a trailer, economy hotel rooms or the homes of people drawn to their pulsing music and the inspired lunacy of their running.
"America is a welcoming country," said 29-year-old Shigeru Yamamoto. "People we didn't know a few hours earlier, we ended up staying at their houses."
Ondekoza gave 300 performances during the run, many planned, some impromptu. Money came from ticket and T-shirt sales, donations, corporate largesse. The people of Crowley, La., made the drummers honorary citizens. The artist's colony of Hillsboro, N.M., made them feel as if they had ended up in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.
"There are only about 173 people in the town, and 98 showed up for our performance," Lienhard said. "It was a small town, but a big push."
 
Not Without Complications
 The running was not without complications. One runner was hit by something dropped from a truck in Japan and lost a leg before the trip began. Two months after leaving New York, the group had its trailer crunched by an 18-wheeler on the North Carolina-South Carolina border. In Virginia, several runners were picked up by the police as they tried to negotiate a five-mile bridge span that was off limits to pedestrians.
"We had made up our minds to run the whole way, so we came back and did it at night," Lienhard said.
And, of course, somebody was bound to get lost on one of the maddening Los Angeles cloverleafs.
"The guy had a beeper, so he called Japan, and they called New York and New York finally called my pager," Lienhard said. "We were supposed to be on the Pacific Coast Highway. We found him on Interstate 405, heading for San Diego."
In the desert from Phoenix to Los Angeles, the temperature hit 110 degrees. When shoes blew out, strips of tires along the road made for spare soles. Four runners eventually dropped out at different points for health reasons. Most everyone had to walk for stretches to nurse a sore knee or a balky muscle. Ryohei Inoue limped across Montana, needing as long as 14 hours to cover 35 miles in a day. His twin brother, Kohei, had earlier experienced a gimpy knee in Florida.
"We were only doing 20 miles a day then, so he was lucky," Ryohei Inoue said.
All nine runners are fit for Sunday's marathon. After completing the run in Central Park, they will head for Brooklyn and a concert at the Grand Army Plaza. On Dec. 3, it's off to Carnegie Hall. After that, there is talk of more running.
Around Europe.

HEADLINE: Small Ranchers Can't Pay More for Arid Lands

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Bruce Babbitt's Landscape, at Risk" (editorial, Oct. 31) captures the attitude of the Clinton Administration (and your newspaper) that the Secretary of the Interior and the Federal Government can lord it over citizens of the West and arrogantly impose upon them a new system of grazing regulations.
This tired old command-and-control approach is deemed by Mr. Babbitt to be in the best interests of Westerners, despite the historical, social, economic and, yes, even democratic arguments to the contrary. 
 Mr. Babbitt and you conveniently forget one important point when endorsing the grazing scheme offered by Senator Harry Reid. Simply put, people have a right to due process.
In Congress that means a right to be heard before legislation is passed. But this backroom Reid-Babbitt deal is being foisted upon Westerners without such basic fairness. Not one hour was spent in Congressional committees of jurisdiction before this deal was cut by a handful of Congressmen and tacked onto Mr. Babbitt's spending bill for quick passage into law -- even though the proposals would dramatically change public policy affecting 270 million acres of the United States.
Remember, Western ranchers, who on average make only $28,000 a year, didn't ask to be neighbors with Federal lands. It simply came to pass in the days of America's westward settlement that no settlers wanted to homestead these unfarmable, arid, desolate lands that eventually devolved to Government control.
It was understood, however, that settlers (and their descendants ranching today) would combine these Federal acres with their private land to provide enough grass to feed livestock and squeeze out a living.
These inhospitable lands deterred homesteaders for the same reasons that today justify the difference in public and private grazing fees. There is no magic, no trickery here. It is the same economic reality that accounts for a different rental charge for an unfurnished sixth-floor efficiency apertment and a furnished penthouse in Manhattan. Both provide shelter, but no one would expect to pay the same rent for both.
Your naked assertion that no ranchers will lose their homes and livelihoods from an 85 percent increase in rent charged by landlord Babbitt is a surprisingly casual and callous disregard for human suffering and of numerous studies by university economists to the contrary. You and your readers would benefit from the facts.
It is clear that the Secretary of the Interior has no interest in resolving the impasse, apparently in the belief that he can steamroller his agenda through the Senate. Our advice, then, is for his boss. President Clinton, the time has now come to get involved. Americans in the West deserve fair play.

BYLINE: By D. J. R. BRUCKNER

 BODY:

Jimmy Tingle's
Uncommon Sense American Place Theater
111 West 46th Street
Manhattan
 
Written and performed by Jimmy Tingle; directed by Larry Arrick; lighting, Christopher Boll; production stage manager, Paul A. Kochman. Presented by the American Place Theater, Wynn Handman, artistic director; Susannah Halston, executive director. 

 Jimmy Tingle has worked his way up the stand-up comedy circuit in the last decade until he stands near the top. But the fact that there is more to him than comic wit is evident in the emotional effect he has on an audience in his one-man show, "Jimmy Tingle's Uncommon Sense."
Mr. Tingle brings so much energy and personal warmth to this 90-minute nonstop performance that one comes away from it strangely uplifted. He reveals often mortifying absurdities in virtually everything that comes to his attention: politics, sex, the economy, religion, education, race, nationality, even assassination. Yet he is so cheerfully intelligent that he makes his audience optimistic in the face of appalling reality.
Having developed his act mostly in comedy clubs, Mr. Tingle lacks some of the artfulness he needs for the theater. He could use more training in a whole range of theatrical gestures that might make him less dependent on words alone.
But those are not great faults. And the man does have courage: he wraps his entire commentary in an autobiographical journey that begins with the murder of President John F. Kennedy, when Mr. Tingle was 5 years old, and he raises laughter at his reactions even to that.
None of the rest of his material is quite so dark. While politicians and various authority figures are his main targets, his most lethal jabs are aimed at consumerism and what he sees as a growing popular revolt against "the gods of the billboards." He applies the logic of cigarette advertising to sportswear with wonderful effect and ridicules the hidden hypocritical moralizing of economic analysts ("Consumer confidence is down? People don't lack confidence; they lack money").
Mr. Tingle's persistent, even philosophical effort to expose prejudices and rid us -- and himself, for he is an engaging sharer -- of them accounts for the uplift one feels at the end. It takes a serious and well-intentioned man to make one laugh to such good effect. D. J. R. BRUCKNER

HEADLINE: Rebounding From Crises, New York Hospital Changes Its Ways

BYLINE: By TOM REDBURN

 BODY:
At a time when New York Hospital, like nearly all others in the city, was facing an acute financial crisis, the mysterious death of Andy Warhol after a routine operation in 1987 added yet another jolt. But in the end, the tragedy helped shock the entire staff of the institution into accepting the need for a sharp change in direction.
New York Hospital -- which, in conjunction with Cornell Medical Center, is among the most distinguished teaching hospitals in the nation -- brought in a new president, introduced modern business practices and, perhaps most importantly, took the lead in looking for innovative ways to escape the fiscal traumas that continue to plague nearly all hospitals in the area. 
 Today, instead of continuing to struggle like most of its counterparts in the city, New York Hospital is considered by its peers to be at the forefront of a transformation of the health care industry across the nation.
Its network now consists of 15 institutions with 4,100 beds capable of serving a population of almost a million people. Within the New York region, it is the first of what is expected to become a host of large, all-embracing providers of managed care, which is the underlying goal of President Clinton's health care overhaul plan.
Not only did New York Hospital undertake measures to improve its bottom line, it also has focused even greater attention on insuring a high level of patient care. In a survey conducted by the Federal Health Care Financing Authority, the overall mortality rate for Medicare patients treated at New York Hospital has been significantly lower than most other hospitals. In the nationwide survey, it stands in the top 1 percent of all hospitals, despite treating patients with unusually severe illnesses.
"The impact of the bashing we were taking was very negative on the staff here and people were very demoralized," recalls Dr. David B. Skinner, who took over as president and chief executive officer of New York Hospital in late 1987. "We were losing $1 million a week, the building was crumbling from age, and there was no question we couldn't go on as before."
 
A Major Expansion
 So Dr. Skinner took a new tack. While engineering a turnaround that took the hospital from a loss of $57.2 million in 1988 to a surplus of $2 million in 1991, he began exploring uncharted waters. Even as other local hospitals were trying just to stay afloat, New York Hospital expanded its reach.
Through a complex corporate arrangement requiring almost no cash on either side, it formed a network of allied hospitals, clinics and nursing homes extending through the city and, most recently, into Westchester County. In May the hospital began a long-delayed $880 million rebuilding project to replace its sprawling 60-year-old Upper East Side monolith with one of the most modern acute-care centers in the nation.
New York City and, to a lesser extent, the state and surrounding region have been well behind the curve in exploring this trend. "In health care, New York has generally been an island apart from the rest of the nation," said Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association. "We've been out of sync."
By contrast, New York Hospital has tried to anticipate the changing marketplace for health care. More than four years ago, the hospital's trustees agreed with Dr. Skinner's idea to form the New York Hospital Care Network, effectively a friendly takeover of smaller institutions. A common board oversees the network.
 
A Family of Institutions
 So far, the network includes, in Manhattan, the Amsterdam Nursing Home, Gracie Square Hospital, the Hospital for Special Surgery, New York Downtown Hospital, the Stanley Isaacs Healthcare Center for Senior Citizens and the Rogosin Institute.
Elsewhere it includes Community Hospital, the Methodist Hospital and its Family Health Center, all in Brooklyn, and in Queens, the New York Hospital Medical Center of Queens (formerly Booth Memorial Medical Center), the Women's and Children's Health Center of Western Queens, the Rogosin Institute Queens Dialysis Center, and Silvercrest Extended Care Facility. Last month, it reached into Westchester for the United Hospital Medical Center in Port Chester.
"The corporate relationship has been a blessing," says Mark Mundy, president of the Methodist Hospital. "What distinguishes our network from others is that we are all part of a family. Since there is no possibility of divorce, we all have to work together on the marriage."
In different ways, several other groups of hospitals are racing to catch up. Mount Sinai Medical Center recently established ties with the Queens Hospital Center, the Jewish Home and Hospital for the Aged in Manhattan and Phelps Memorial Hospital in Westchester. Beth Israel Medical Center just purchased a chain of six doctors' offices in Westchester.
Meanwhile, many of the same institutions have formed looser links to create their own "preferred provider" networks. One of them, Premier Preferred Care, offers its patients access to a network of doctors and hospitals in New York and New Jersey at discount prices.
 
Savings in Consolidation
 Whatever happens to Mr. Clinton's proposal in Congress, the introduction of competition into the practice of medicine means that such integrated networks are almost certain to be the key institutions in any revamped health care system.
Under the concept of managed care, patients receive all their medical services from a group of providers, from simpler primary care at doctors' offices and routine operations at outpatient clinics to emergency care and intensive, so-called tertiary care at sophisticated medical centers. Savings are achieved by using advanced computers and pooling services to reduce overhead. Even more important is the ability to funnel a steady, more predictable supply of patients through the network.
"We realized," Dr. Skinner said, "that health care delivery had to change from the very decentralized, Mom-and-Pop approach to streamlined systems that use modern technology and link together the various systems from primary care, community hospitals, to tertiary and emergency care to nursing homes into a seamless web. As in any other industry, there are substantial savings to be found."
Indeed, the cushy world of nonprofit hospitals is being transformed into the cutthroat business of providing medical services to what insiders call "covered lives." And Dr. Skinner is the very embodiment of the doctor who has become a hard-nosed, up-to-date, computer-literate executive to preside over such a transition.
"See, I still put on my white coat," said Dr. Skinner, somewhat defensively, as he concludes an interview to take a reporter on a brief tour of the hospital.
"I don't think I'll ever entirely lose the physician mind-set," he added. "Doctors have to be part of the solution, not just part of the problem. I've taken on this business role because I believe that if we weren't involved, it would just get worse."
Dr. Skinner's methods have not gone down easily. Coming to New York Hospital from Chicago with a reputation as a tough bargainer, he insisted on full authority, gaining considerably more administrative power than his predecessor. He replaced several of the hospital's senior department heads. Amid tensions over real estate the dean of the affiliated Cornell medical center resigned in 1991 to return to his native Texas.
But his approach also got results. In a recent speech, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo said that Dr. Skinner has demonstrated that "he's not only a skilled physician, but also a master business manager."
The Governor said: "He's establishing a network for managed care with the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center serving as the hub. That network will serve as the perfect complement of a new national health-care plan." For his work, Dr. Skinner, 58, received salary and benefits worth $809,000 last year.
For Dr. Skinner, as for many other health care providers, the ultimate target of his ambition is now coming into view. He would like hospitals to take over the job that insurance companies now perform and thereby capture the money for his own institution.
 
'Extracting Premium Dollars'
 "There is a fairly strong sense on our board -- and it's spreading elsewhere, too, I might add -- that insurance companies don't bring added value to the health care industry," he said. "To the extent administrative costs are high, including a profit to their shareholders, they are extracting premium dollars away that could be captured by a provider-sponsored service and used to provide better health care."
New York Hospital is actively exploring the creation of its own health maintenance organization to offer its network of services directly to employers and their employees. For all the temptations, however, the venture would be fraught with risks. The greatest danger is retaliation by insurance companies that now direct patients to the hospitals within the network.
"New York Hospital would absolutely lose our membership if they formed an H.M.O.," David Alpeter, senior vice president at Aetna Health Plans of New York, recently told Crain's New York Business.
Dr. Skinner seems prepared to take the plunge within the next few years. "We won't go into that until we have a large enough network," he said. "But we are approaching the point where we feel confident we could rapidly acquire a sufficient panel of patients on our own."
Much is at stake for major hospitals. Once national health care is adopted, "My greatest long-run fear is that health care will be dominated by large insurance companies," says Mr. Raske of the hospital association, which represents 152 hospitals and nursing homes in the New York area. "Instead of local control, power would shift to Hartford," where many of the largest insurance companies are headquartered.
For now at least, the insurance industry professes to be unworried about being squeezed out of a very lucrative business.
"If groups of providers want to take on the risks of health insurance, they are going to have to come up with considerably greater resources to satisfy state requirements of financial soundness," says Kylanne Green, director of managed care at the Health Insurance Association . of America in Washington. "In general, their pockets aren't very deep."
 
Thinnest of Margins
 That's true, particularly in New York, where hospitals have been heavily regulated and operate on the thinnest of margins. Even New York Hospital, healthier than most of its counterparts, is going deeply into debt to finance its new building, which will stretch across Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive between 68th and 70th Streets.
But help could be on the way. White House officials, upset at the health insurers' opposition to Mr. Clinton's plan, are suggesting that Washington might side with the hospital industry in its looming battle with the insurance business. Ira C. Magaziner, the White House's senior adviser for health policy, recently proposed that the Federal government offer financing to hospital-run networks willing to assume all the risks of full coverage.
Whatever happens, Dr. Skinner thinks New York Hospital is ready. "Nobody really knows what the health care delivery system is going to look like in the future," he said. "But I think our network structure provides us with the flexibility to offer top-quality care no matter what."

HEADLINE: THE FREE TRADE ACCORD;
Mexicans Seethe With Anger At Perot's Depiction of Them

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Nov. 10

 BODY:
After weeks in which Mexicans seemed to hold their anger at criticism of their country by opponents of the North American Free Trade Agreement in the United States, they fairly exploded today at Ross Perot's depiction of Mexico the night before.
"Last night, Mexico was the object of a long series of calumnies and lies," the Government-owned newspaper El Nacional said in an editorial on Mr. Perot's comments on the trade agreement in his debate with Vice President Al Gore. And the accusation was echoed by many others. 
 "He's never set foot here!" said Luis Estrada, a 50-year-old lawyer in a gray business suit who put down his sandwich at a downtown restaurant. "How is it possible that he can say everyone lives in poverty here? Before he opens his mouth, he ought to come down here and take a look."
 
Words of Rage
 Cristina Cueto, a graphic designer in the upscale neighborhood of Polanco, offered a series of off-color terms for Mr. Perot before settling on a mild epithet.
Relatively few Mexicans watched or heard the debate on Tuesday night between Mr. Perot and Mr. Gore, but angry newspaper editorials, outraged politicians and word-of-mouth seemed to carry what regular Mexican television programming had not.
And after weeks in which other American opponents of the trade pact have been assailing Mexico as polluted, corrupt, destitute and undemocratic, there was some new evidence for the warnings of officials here that a backlash of anti-American feelings could ensue if the accord is rejected by the United States Congress in a vote scheduled for next Wednesday.
What rankled Mexicans was that in the course of the 90-minute debate on CNN's "Larry King Live," Mr. Perot described Mexico as a destitute, authoritarian and unjust place where "36 families own over half the country," virtually everyone else lives in poverty, and factory workers dream of having outhouses and running water.
"People who don't make anything cannot buy anything," said Mr. Perot, who held up photographs of what he described as hovels surrounding an American plant in Mexico. He said some Mexican workers were building homes of cardboard, implying that this was what to expect if the trade accord was approved.
Some of his assertions were seen here as merely exaggerated, while others were denounced as patently untrue.
While poverty in Mexico is widespread, for instance, most studies indicate that less than half, about 40 percent, of the population lives below the poverty line. The figure in the United States is about 14 percent. Similarly, according to the latest Mexican Government statistics, the richest tenth of Mexican households takes in 37.9 percent of the country's total household income. And whatever they might earn, Mexicans as a whole are the third largest customer for exports from the United States.
Not all Mexicans seemed to wince at the country's rough-handed treatment. Some critics of the accord have viewed Washington's debate as an opportunity to voice their complaints about the policies of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. At least some seemed to appreciate that Mr. Perot had gone so far in countering what they see as Mexican Government propaganda.
Mexico's Trade Secretary, Jaime Serra Puche, sought to emphasize the positive. He called the debate a "fortunate" departure from the unanswered criticism with which Mexico and the trade agreement have sometimes been showered in the past.
 
'Distortions and Inventions'
 "For the first time, the distortions and inventions of the opposing group, headed by Mr. Perot, were given correct and specific answers of fact," Mr. Serra said. "It seems to me that in that sense it was particularly positive."
There was also a good deal of rejoicing today at the Mexico City stock exchange. The elation was based on a perception that Mr. Gore had knocked his opponent around and improved the prospects for the agreement.
Yet there was no shortage of prickly reactions to Mr. Perot's remarks.
"His words were totally offensive to the Mexican people," said Evararido Rodriguez, a computer programmer at the Bolsa who read of Mr. Perot's comments in a newspaper. "They don't have anything to do with reality."
At the announcement this afternoon of $1.5 billion worth of new real estate investments in Mexico City, Javier Beristain was having similar trouble with Mr. Perot's imagery. "I imagine that Mr. Perot is not very well informed," said Mr. Beristain, the city's courtly planning secretary. "He obviously has not undertaken a complete analysis of the new Mexico."
Political analysts here differ on how directly the continuing criticism of Mexico in the United States might lead to a resurgence of anti-American sentiment in Mexico if the pact is defeated.
Mexican officials and their opponents expected that the Salinas administration's policies would be discussed in the American debate, including its efforts to perpetuate the 64-year control of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party. But as with recent moves to toughen efforts to stop illegal immigrants on the United States' southern border, some Mexicans said they were surprised that American officials could overlook their country's sensitivity to criticism, even as a historic partnership is in the balance.
Sergio Aguayo, a political scientist who has studied the evolution of Mexico's image in the United States, argued that even Mr. Gore spoke in the debate in what many Mexicans would consider "interventionist" terms. "More than racism, there was a kind of cultural disdain coming from both of them," he said. "There was a kind of 'us and them' attitude. And I think both of them expressed the view that Mexico's future depends on the United States."

Alarmed by the possibility that cable operators in many cities might be free to raise prices as high as they want, the Federal Communications Commission decided today to extend a temporary revenue freeze on cable companies for three months to give cities more time to study the new regulations. 
 The problem is the latest of several recent signs that the new cable law is not delivering the consumer benefits that Congress envisioned in October 1992 when it passed the legislation over the veto of President George Bush. Last month, for example, a preliminary study by the F.C.C. found that about a third of cable subscribers have seen their rates increase since the new pricing regulations went into place.
 
Local Responsibility
 Under the Federal law that took effect last spring, local governments were given the primary responsibility for regulating cable prices under guidelines established by the F.C.C. Cities and towns must first apply for certification from the F.C.C., which entails filling out a one-page form.
Yet so far, agency officials say only about half the 11,000 communities have sought certification. The problem is most widespread among small towns and cities, many experts said, because many fear the potential complexity and administrative burden will overwhelm their resources. But other experts say the reluctance stems primarily from the cable companies, which have waged a concerted effort in many cities to persuade local officials against becoming regulators.
"Many of them are scared," said Barry Orton, a professor of telecommunications at the University of Wisconsin and a consultant to local cable authorities in that state. "Some fear it's going to cost them money. Some are against it on principle. And some have been talked out of it by cable companies."
As a group, officials from medium and large cities were among the staunchest advocates of the new law as it progressed through Congress. And most big cities, including New York, have been quick to seek the F.C.C. authority to regulate cable prices.
But local officials in some smaller municipalities apparently find the Federal rules too burdensome. "Once you get tied up with the Feds, you can end up running the cable system yourself," said Marvin Thompson, the president of the City Council in Rice Lake, Wis., a town of 8,000 people. The Council decided not to seek F.C.C. certification for regulating cable. "We just decided we didn't know enough to make a decision," he said.
 
Government Reluctance
 The reluctance of local governments marks the latest strange twist to the saga of cable rate regulation. In overriding President Bush's veto, Congress passed what was seen as a tough law designed to address the consumer outcry over soaring cable prices, which were deregulated in 1987. Since that year, cable rates have risen at more than twice the rate of inflation, in part because all but a handful of cable systems face no head-to-head competition.
But the new regulations have generated continuing controversy as the F.C.C. has tried to codify the intent of Congress. F.C.C. officials initially predicted that the regulations would lead to a $1 billion annual rate reduction nationwide. Instead, prices for at least a third of all customers have gone up rather than down, and the biggest rate reductions have gone to relatively affluent customers who buy extra cable outlets and remote control devices. People who subscribe to the most basic packages of service have often seen prices go up.
Few people dispute that the new rate regulations are complicated. The rate rules alone are more than 400 pages long, and the rules on technical and programming issues run hundreds of pages more.
The F.C.C. tried to simplify the rate rules by establishing a set of "benchmark" prices for different kinds of cable systems, a move designed to avoid the endless analyses used in telephone rate regulation to determine a company's costs and allow a reasonable profit. But a city must still wade through a long list of calculations, juggling the number of channels and the prices for installations, extra outlets and remote control devices.
Beyond that, a cable company is allowed to appeal the benchmark prices by asking for a separate proceeding to explain its costs. While the F.C.C. and the courts ultimately must decide such appeals, the city is responsible for seeing the case through the process.
"You've got to think about this in the context that there are a lot of very small towns and counties with limited resources who have always been very suspicious of the Federal Government," said William F. Squadron, the Commissioner of Telecommunications and Energy for New York City. Mr. Squadron, who is also the president of a national association of telecommunications administrators, added that many cable companies had worked hard to foster those concerns among local officials.
For example, Marcus Cable, which is based in Dallas, in July wrote to the local officials in small cities in Wisconsin where it has cable systems, warning that the Federal rules would create a nightmare. "This hodge-podge of rules, requirements, edicts and dictates is, in a word, ludicrous," wrote Jeffrey Marcus, the president of the company. "The losers are the cable customers, the municipalities, and the cable companies."
 
'Step Up to the Plate'
 Despite such pressures, some consumer advocates said municipalities bore a good measure of responsibility for delaying the implementation of the new cable rules. "They've really got to step up to the plate and do something," said Brad Stillman, legislative counsel for the Consumer Federation of America, which pushed hard for the cable law last year. "I guess I'm surprised. The cities had been pretty gung-ho on enabling this legislation. This is somewhat troublesome."

HEADLINE: New Home Option: Surviving Flames

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WEBB, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 10

 BODY:
Watching the television images of brush fires engulfing the canyons of Southern California, most viewers probably had mixed emotions: awe at the scale of destruction, and relief that they were safe from risk.
But natural fires can occur almost anywhere, especially in forested areas and during droughts. In 1992, there were 439,000 reported brush and grass fires, according to the National Fire Protection Association. 
 Richard Bukowski, senior research engineer with the Building and Fire Research Laboratory at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg, Md., cited current risks in Texas and in the Southeast, where pine forests have been devastated by beetles. "If I were living in a wooded area, even in the Northeast, and it were time to replace a shingled roof, I would look for one that was highly fire-resistant," he said.
But the degree of risk varies greatly. "California is the only state with an insurance designation for brush-fire zones," said Chris Guidette of the Insurance Services Office, an organization in New York that prepares statistics for property insurers."
Fire is part of the ecology in the arid West, nature's way of clearing old growth and regenerating the landscape. But well-protected houses in high-risk areas can survive the flames. Creative architects and builders have developed fire-resistant alternatives to the rustic cottages and wooden chalets that have regularly succumbed to conflagrations.
To Bui-Bender, a Vietnam-born civil engineer and builder, anticipated the need for protection when he constructed his family house in Laguna Beach with stucco walls, a concrete-tiled roof and double-glazed windows. For four hours before the fire reached the house on Wednesday, he hosed down the stucco and surrounding vegetation. Later that evening, he appeared on television beside his house, which had survived amid the devastation of the neighborhood.
But most people are not as sensible as Mr. Bui-Bender.
"Very few of my clients put a premium on fire protection, even when they get involved in every other aspect of the design," said Ron Goldman, an architect in Malibu. "People who live close to nature want to build in natural materials -- wood stands for comfort and tradition."
Another Malibu architect, David Lawrence Gray, built a wood-shingle house for himself when he arrived in Los Angeles from the Northwest, via the University of California at Berkeley. "As soon as I saw my first fire, I realized that was a dumb thing to do," he confessed, "and for the last five years, I've used only steel and concrete. If you must use wood as a facing, you should back it with a fire-resistant 5/8-inch drywall."
Fire officials and building experts agree that the first priority, wherever you live, is to cut back dried vegetation from around the house and create a green belt of fire-resistant grasses, ice plants, salvias or whatever varieties a nursery recommends for the climate and site. Citrus trees make an effective fire block; eucalyptus and pine are highly flammable. When renewing scorched slopes, they recommend planting deep-rooted plants to check erosion.
Chief John Montenero of the Santa Monica Fire Department, said he becomes frustrated and angry when he sees homeowners neglecting their responsibilities. "I've even heard careless people say, 'That's what I carry insurance for,' " he said.
To be safe, he added, you should set the house back 100 feet from dry vegetation on an average slope, and up to 500 feet on sheer slopes, which can accelerate updrafts. "And you need a pump that will put out 250 gallons a minute through a one-and-a-half-inch hose from your pool or a water tank," he continued. "You don't have a chance in a Santa Ana with a garden hose."
Even with such clearings and plantings and abundant water, a house can be ignited by radiant heat or flying embers. Dick Davis of Factory Mutual Engineers in Boston, an expert on building materials, recommends brick, stucco or concrete for walls, and clay or concrete tiles for the roof. The eaves should be sealed to exclude wind-borne sparks.
Buzz Yudell, an architect, and his wife, Tina Beebe, a color consultant, incorporated these lessons in the house they built in Malibu. A tin roof fits snugly atop the stucco walls, with no overhang. The house is set well back from vegetation on every side, and the interiors have sprinklers.
As an economy, they chose not to use double-glazed windows, which retard the transfer of radiant heat and are less likely to break. "Someone should market the painted metal shutters or roll-up metal blinds that are common in France and Italy," he said.
Often, people neglect the simplest precautions. Mr. Gray noted that a neighbor's roof has been piled high with driftwood and an old boat for more than three years. And Mr. Goldman pointed out that houses are built of the same materials used centuries ago. He said he hoped that the rising cost of wood would encourage the use of innovative industrial products. In a house he designed for himself on the Malibu beach, Mr. Goldman used translucent fiberglass for a large skylight, and last week it survived a flurry of burning embers.
Expense is a factor. Ceramic glass will withstand a high level of radiant heat without cracking, but its high cost -- four to eight times that of conventional glass -- restricts its use.
Steven Ehrlich, a Santa Monica architect whose outlook was shaped by his Peace Corps experience in Africa, says he sees a need to live in harmony with nature.
"A house in Malibu should not be like one in New England," he said. "What we need here are porous fortresses -- to withstand human and natural assaults, and to open up to the benign climate."
He recalled the thick-walled courtyard houses he explored in the Sahara and the Sahel, simple shelters that stayed cool for most of the day. "Here, you can use poured concrete or concrete block for the walls, open up courtyards on one side to the ocean or a view, and protect the wide openings with sliding steel doors."
These safeguards can be considered the price of living -- perhaps of surviving -- in an earthly paradise.

HEADLINE: Emotion Rules TV Debate on Puerto Rican Vote

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN JUAN, P.R., Nov. 10

 BODY:
With Puerto Ricans set to vote on Sunday on whether they want statehood, independence or a continuation of commonwealth status, leaders of the island's three main political parties resorted to emotional appeals in a crucial televised debate on Tuesday night, their last chance to address uncommitted voters en masse.
Unless Puerto Rico becomes the 51st state, said Gov. Pedro J. Rossello, head of the pro-statehood New Progressive Party, Congress could deprive the island's 3.7 million residents of their American citizenship. 
 Mr. Rossello's chief rival, Senator Miguel Hernandez Agosto of the Popular Democratic Party, which favors an "enhanced" commonwealth status, countered that Puerto Ricans might be forced to give up "our language, our anthem and our sports teams" to enter the union.
Senator Ruben Berrios Martinez, leader of the Puerto Rican Independence Party, on the other hand, urged what he called "this country on its knees" to forge a new identity through a complete break with the United States. "There is only one colony left in the world with a population of more than a million people," he said, "and that is Puerto Rico."
 
Dead Heat in Poll
 The two-hour debate, conducted in Spanish and broadcast by the Telemundo network, was characterized by angry accusations and heated language, with both Governor Rossello and Mr. Hernandez Agosto saying the other had run "a campaign based on fear and lies." Mr. Berrios in turn said both statehood and commonwealth offered only "a vision of dependence, lack of functions and handouts."
A poll published today in a San Juan newspaper, El Nuevo Dia, shows statehood and commonwealth running virtually even, at about 40 percent each, and independence trailing at 5 percent. That survey of 1,000 people, conducted door to door from last Wednesday to Monday, also indicated that most of the 15 percent of voters still undecided seemed to be leaning in favor of statehood. The poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
Sunday's plebiscite, in which about two-thirds of Puerto Rico's two million registered voters are expected to participate, has been endorsed by the White House as a welcome exercise in self-determination, but the result is not binding. No matter which wins, any change in Puerto Rico's status would require approval of Congress, which in the past has been extremely reluctant to deal with the issue.
Some Republicans fear that a Puerto Rican state would send an overwhelmingly Democratic delegation to Congress. Democrats and Republicans alike question the expense of a state in which most of the population would qualify for welfare benefits, and some fear that Puerto Rican statehood would give momentum to a campaign to grant statehood to the District of Columbia.
 
Question of Citizenship
 It was exactly the dependence on the good will of Congress that Governor Rossello, a pediatric surgeon elected last year in his first campaign for office, advanced as a principal reason to seek statehood. Echoing a recent television advertisement, he referred several times on Tuesday to a study by the Congressional Research Service, an arm of the Library of Congress, that concludes that Congress has "the power to sever the United States' relationship with the island" unilaterally as long as Puerto Rico remains a commonwealth.
Mr. Hernandez Agosto dismissed the issue as a scare tactic that in practical political terms is meaningless. Congress also has the power to declare war on the Vatican, he noted, "but that doesn't mean it will." Citing Supreme Court decisions, he also argued that "Congress cannot take away the citizenship of any American citizen without his consent."
Mr. Hernandez Agosto also questioned the patriotism of Mr. Rossello and other advocates of statehood, implying they were willing to sacrifice Puerto Rico's interests and cultural identity in their eagerness to join the union.
"One does not negotiate the nation," he said. "One does not sell the nation."
 
Question of Costs
 Mr. Rossello repeatedly attacked what he called the "impotence" of the commonwealth model, noting that soldiers from Puerto Rico had repeatedly been sent off to war without the island's having a voice in the decision and that the island's economic model was largely imposed by Washington. More than 40 years of commonwealth, he argued, have failed to "breach the income gap" between Puerto Rico and the United States mainland.
"Those of you who have gone to the United States, who have relatives living there, know that the standard of living is higher there," Mr. Rossello said, addressing voters directly. Puerto Rico's per capita income is about $6,200 a year, the highest in Latin America but less than half that of the United States as a whole.
With statehood, Mr. Rossello predicted, Puerto Rico would automatically receive an annual injection of more than $3 billion in new Federal money, like Medicare payments and Aid to Families With Dependent Children, which would spur growth. In addition, he said in response to a journalist's question, Congress would have to allocate even more money to the island, "no doubt about it," because Puerto Rico would need "extraordinary aid" to rise to the levels of the 50 other states.
"Congress has to assume its responsibility to a new state," he said.
Answering the same question, Mr. Hernandez Agosto said enhanced commonwealth status would also "cost Congress some money." His party said it would seek extension of some Social Security benefits, protection for Puerto Rican agriculture and restoration of some tax exemptions that Congress reduced this year.
But he argued that the benefits of commonwealth included exemptions from Federal income taxes, and he said statehood would be costly. Not only would some Puerto Ricans have to pay Federal income tax, he said, but Mr. Rossello's party would also have to institute a sales tax and raise property and gasoline levies to make up for revenues like some business taxes that were possible only with commonwealth status.
Mr. Berrios was also critical of commonwealth status, complaining of "the indolence promoted by the government and colonial status." But he said statehood would "convert Puerto Rico more and more into the ghetto it already is." He urged voters to be courageous, saying, "To be afraid of an independent republic is to be afraid of oneself."

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Three Choices for Puerto Rico's Future"
 
POLITICAL STRUCTURE
 Commonwealth: Residents vote in Presidential primaries, but not in other Federal elections. The island sends a single nonvoting delegate to Congress. The local government is headed by an elected Governor, and there is an elected bicameral legislature.
 Statehood: Puerto Rico's congressional delegation would consist of two senators and at least six representatives, with full voting powers. Residents would enjoy the same constitutional rights and benefits as all other citizens, including the 2.6 million Puerto Ricans living on the mainland.
 Independence: Puerto Rico would become a fully sovereign republic, with its own diplomatic representation and membership in international organizations. The only formal tie to the United States would be a treaty of friendship and cooperation, to be negotiated during a 10 year transition to independence.
 
TAXES AND BENEFITS
 Commonwealth: Residents of the island are exempted from Federal income taxes, though Puerto Ricans living on the mainland are taxed like all other citizens. In order to generate jobs, American companies operating in Puerto Rico also get an exemption on local profits. Puerto Rico does receive large amounts of Federal aid, though payments are capped at levels far below that of any state.
 Statehood: Special tax exemptions for industry would disappear, and Puerto Ricans would have to begin filing income tax returns like all other Americans. Because income levels are less than half those on the mainland, many Puerto Ricans would not have to pay Federal taxes and would be eligible for an "earned income credit" of up to $2,000 a year.
 Independence: Military veterans and retired people would continue to receive their pensions, but other Federal payments to Puerto Rico would eventually cease. Instead, a new system of local taxation and tariffs would be implemented. Independence advocates say they would also press the United States to pay for having occupied the island since 1898.
 
LANGUAGE AND CULTURE
 Commonwealth: Both Spanish and English have been official languages since early this year, reversing previous legislation that granted that status only to Spanish. Because of its uniquely ambiguous relationship with the United States, Puerto Rico has its own Olympic team and participates in other major international competitions and events as if it were independent.
 Statehood: Advocates say Puerto Rico would continue to be a bilingual entity, though commonwealth backers dispute that, arguing that Congress has required some states to adopt an "English only" policy as a condition of entry into the Union. Like all other states, Puerto Rico would have its own flag and anthem, but would probably be forced to give up its Olympic team.
 Independence: Spanish would become the sole official language, and schools would give more emphasis to Puerto Rican culture and history, phasing out a "colonial" curriculum.
 
CITIZENSHIP
 Commonwealth: Backers of commonwealth status insist that American citizenship is irrevocable, but statehood forces argue that is only true of Puerto Ricans born on the American mainland. Puerto Ricans are eligible for military service, whether born on the island or in one of the 50 states, and thousands have served with distinction.
 Statehood: Full American citizenship, with all the rights and responsibilities it confers, to all Puerto Ricans, regardless of their birthplace.
 Independence: Those who wish to maintain their American citizenship would be allowed to do so, through a system of dual nationality, but that right would not be extended to those born after independence. Puerto Ricans would become a nationality separate from that of the United States and would travel with their own passports.

HEADLINE: Clinton Pushing Business With Asia

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 9

 BODY:
Seeking to capitalize on the world's fastest-growing economies, the Clinton Administration is pushing to topple trade barriers in East Asia, increase export subsidies and persuade United States companies to overcome their traditional reluctance to expand in the region.
While trade with Mexico and Canada dominates national debate, the Administration is orchestrating the push out of concern that businesses are not taking advantage of the huge opportunities in a region whose boom the World Bank calls the East Asian miracle. 
 Some officials have suggested creating a zone free of barriers to trade and investment on both sides of the Pacific, invoking the same philosophy that underlies the North American Free Trade Agreement: more trade means more jobs.
"The fact is this is the most dynamic region in the world," said Winston Lord, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs. "If we are interested in more exports and jobs, the most lucrative direction is the Asia-Pacific region."
 
Waking Up Businesses
 Corporate America has been slow to expand in East Asia. The Administration's plans are also presented as a way to prod businesses to wake up to the opportunities, though some critics may question whether the Administration's push is more show than substance.
A central part of the plan is to transform a weak, 15-nation association -- the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum -- into a powerful group that might, for instance, establish uniform rules for trans-Pacific trade and investment. The forum includes the United States, Canada, and 13 nations in Asia.
In parallel actions to increase the United States economic presence in Asia, the Administration is pressing Japan to open its market more to manufactured goods. The Administration's efforts have yet to produce concrete changes in Japanese practices, however.
The Treasury Department has also stepped up a campaign to put pressure on Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and other nations to remove barriers to American banks and insurers.
And the Trade Representative's office is pushing China to remove quotas on goods like cars, chemicals and computers.
 
Clinton to Meet Pacific Leaders
 As part of the Administration's efforts, President Clinton will meet in Seattle on Nov. 19 and 20 with the leaders of the other 14 nations. Some officials fear that the President's position could be undercut, however, if Congress defeats the North American Free Trade Agreement in a vote scheduled two days before the summit meeting.
Several officials described the push as a strategic repositioning, redirecting economic ties from slow-growing, inward-looking Europe toward a more dynamic, outward-looking Asia.
"If you look at our problems in that region, a lot has to do with the lassitude and ignorance of American business," said Paula Stern, a Washington-based trade consultant. "There needs to be a sense of urgency on the part of U.S. interests because we are slipping, relatively speaking, in that area."
American companies have been slow to expand in East Asia for various reasons, including cultural differences, trade barriers, a lack of capital, a widespread perception that much of the region remains backward and opportunities in other regions, like Latin America and Eastern Europe.
Governments in Japan, Thailand and other nations also maintain that Washington has simply been too complacent, allowing Japanese investors to fill the vacuum. They are also concerned that the recent withdrawal of United States military forces from the Philippines and, in part, from Japan and South Korea signifies a diminishing interest in Asia.
Still another problem is that Asia represents a wide range of countries, from rich to poor, with different concerns about protecting their industries with trade and investment barriers.
Many trade experts question how soon the Administration's Pacific overtures will translate into more exports and investments. Officials acknowledge that it may take years for these efforts to bear fruit.
If the United States increases its $129billion in annual exports to Asia by just 10 percent, that will mean 240,000 new American jobs, experts say.
 
Demand for Goods Seen
 In another decade, the World Bank predicts, the combined economies of China, Taiwan and Hong Kong will grow larger than the United States economy. In the same period, officials say, China, Indonesia, Taiwan and other countries will be shopping for hundreds of billions of dollars in goods and services in which American companies are world leaders.
These include computers, aircraft, telecommunications equipment, hospital equipment, airport construction, power generators and financial services like insurance. Wall Street's investment banking giants might also benefit from East Asia's huge need for billions of dollars in capital to finance factories and infrastructure, officials say.
The Administration is eager to use its Asian efforts to show that post-cold-war foreign policy can indeed translate into more jobs and higher living standards for Americans.
"Improved economic cooperation with Asia is naturally a major component of a foreign policy directed at promoting prosperity at home," said Lawrence H. Summers, Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs. "Asia, which already represents a trillion-dollar-a-year import market, will account for nearly half the world's economic growth over the next decade."
 
Details of the Boom
 In the view of Administration officials, most Americans fail to recognize how fast Asia's economy has grown, how trade with Asia is booming and how rich many Asians have become. Per-capita income in Singapore is $15,000 a year, higher than in many Western European countries.
Indonesia's economy has more than doubled since 1985, and while most of its 190 million people remain poor, it has developed a sizable middle class able to afford American goods.
Thanks to moves toward a free market, China's economy has been growing by a phenomenal 12 percent a year. Since 1988, United States exports to Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia have more than doubled. In 1980 the nation's trans-Atlantic trade was the same size as its trans-Pacific trade, but now the Pacific trade is 50 percent larger.
"Asia is likely to be the most dynamic part of the world in the decades to come," said Robert E. Rubin, director of the National Economic Council. "The idea is to have the freest possible trade with Asia."
The Administration is convinced that it can play a major role in expanding exports by improving political relations, reaffirming security ties and promoting economic cooperation, for instance, by pushing to reduce customs paperwork or harmonizing product standards. If the United States and a dozen Pacific nations develop common standards for mobile phones or satellite channels, that will increase United States exports.
 
Malaysian Boycotting Summit
 Some Asian officials complain that the Seattle summit meeting shows that Washington is arrogantly assuming a leadership role in East Asia. For this reason Malaysia's Prime Minister, Mahathir Mohamad, plans to boycott the talks.
But other Asian officials have quite a different fear: that the meeting will mainly be a photo opportunity with little follow-up. Leaders of some nations are eager for Washington to play a larger role, partly to serve as a counterweight to Japan and China.
"They certainly want us to stay on in security and economic terms," said Mr. Lord, of the State Department. "They find that we provide stability. Each one has concerns over the longer term about one or more of its neighbors. They see us as a friendly balancing nation."

HEADLINE: THE FREE TRADE ACCORD;
Perot Stake Under Pact Is Not Clear

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 10

 BODY:
A business owned by Ross Perot that became a central point of contention in his debate with Vice President Gore on Tuesday night told the Commerce Department earlier this year that it intended to take advantage of the surge in trading that would follow passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Questions about the venture, Alliance Corridor Inc., a 9,700-acre distribution center near Fort Worth that uses Federal tariff breaks to attract business, led to a series of testy exchanges, as Mr. Gore suggested that Mr. Perot stood to gain personally from his campaign against the pact. 
 Mr. Gore went on to say that Mr. Perot "has set it up so that he will benefit financially" whether the trade agreement passes or fails.
A review of documents filed by Alliance and interviews with Commerce Department and trade officials as well as Perot aides indicates that the Alliance has much more to gain from passage of agreement than its defeat.
Barry P. Bosworth, a Brookings Institution economist, dismissed Mr. Gore's suggestion that Mr. Perot would benefit from the pact's defeat. "I don't find the logic of that at all," he said. "That project is a good idea only on the basis of trade with Latin America."
 
Room for Confusion
 Both in Mr. Gore's assertions and in Mr. Perot's responses about Alliance, there was plenty of room for confusion.
The Perot family is developing the center for the distribution of goods in the United States and Mexico. The family is building vast warehouses for lease to other businesses, while the Santa Fe Railroad is building the largest freight-handling operation in the Southwest there. Mr. Perot is the principal investor in the venture.
According to a 1991 filing by Alliance with the Commerce Department, the project intends to take advantage of the higher volumes of freight that the trade pact would produce. "As the goods begin to flow, the Alliance Corridor will act as a hub for free trade," the filing said.
The filing was part of a petition for the Commerce Department to designate the project as a foreign trade zone, a status that allows businesses to delay payment of import taxes and sometimes pay lower rates. The petition was approved on Aug. 31.
Mr. Gore mainly emphasized the contradiction between Mr. Perot's public opposition to the trade pact and the Alliance project's advocacy of it. But he also suggested that Mr. Perot would benefit more from the foreign-trade zone if the pact failed, when the actual benefit would be very small or nonexistent, managers of other foreign trade zones in Texas said today.
 
Contradictory Motives
 "I think he has set it up so that he will benefit financially either way," Mr. Gore said. And at another point he suggested that Mr. Perot might be opposing the agreement to hold on to the relative advantages a foreign trade zone designation conveys. "If it's good enough for him," Mr. Gore declared, gesturing at Mr. Perot, "why not the rest of the country?"
Mr. Bosworth described the foreign trade zone's benefits as trivial compared with the trade pact's benefits for Alliance.
A Commerce Department official who insisted on anonymity noted that the use of a foreign trade zone does not eliminate the need to pay duties even for imports that are taxed. The main advantage of a foreign trade zone like Alliance is that it allows the importer to postpone the payment of duties, earning interest on the money in the meanwhile, the official said.
Manufacturers with factories in foreign trade zones are able to reduce the tax rate that they pay on some imported components for assembly, by choosing to pay the lower of the tax rate on the components or the tax rate on the finished product. But this requires separate approval by the Commerce Department, and the Alliance project has never applied for such approval, the department official said.
Mr. Gore also referred to the Alliance foreign trade zone incorrectly four times as a free trade zone. A free trade zone is a group of countries that do not collect tariffs on each other's goods.
Alliance officials expressed irritation today about the confusion, which Mr. Perot perpetuated during the debate by using the free trade zone term twice after Mr. Gore began using it. "Free trade zone has a connotation or perceived definition, that is different from a foreign trade zone -- it was most misleading," said Timothy D. Ward, the president of the Alliance Trade Authority, which operates the foreign trade zone.
Mr. Gore also suggested during the debate that the foreign trade zone had allowed an American company, Valmont Electric Inc., to shut down its factory in Illinois, move to Mexico and ship its products back to the United States without paying duties. "They closed down in Danville, 400 jobs lost, they opened up in Mexico with 100 jobs down there, and now they ship their products duty free back into the United States through the Alliance Airport," Mr. Gore said.
But no duties apply to the product, regardless of whether it comes through a trade zone, Federal officials said. Mr. Ward said the foreign trade zone status had never been activated for Valmont's warehouse. "They located to Alliance because of its distribution capability," he said.
Valmont executives were traveling today and did not return telephone calls for comment.
Mr. Gore first mentioned Valmont Electric to raise the issue of Alliance. But Jay Ziegler, a spokesman for Mr. Gore's office, said that the Vice President had not explicitly linked the duty-free status to the foreign trade zone. "It makes it sound that way, but that's not explicitly what the Vice President said," Mr. Ziegler said.
Mr. Ziegler said that Mr. Gore meant to say that the foreign trade zone gives Mr. Perot an advantage if the agreement fails. But the Commerce Department official said there were 25 other free trade zones in Texas, including three others near Fort Worth.
Terry Parent, the director of marketing for the Dallas-Fort Worth Airport, which also has a foreign trade zone designation, said that the designation would become more important if the trade pact is approved. The trade zone would still help for imports from countries outside North America, and these imports from outside the continent will likely increase if the agreement is adopted, he said.
The Alliance project is not the only one in which Mr. Perot appears likely to benefit financially from Congressional approval of the pact. He also owns a stake in the Perot Systems Corporation, a computer services company that is trying to do more business in Mexico.
Morton Meyerson, the chairman and chief executive of Perot Systems, was quoted on Oct. 20 by a Mexican newspaper, El Norte, as saying that, "Perot would be much better off if he favored Nafta rather than oppose it since his businesses would operate with great success in Mexico."
Mr. Meyerson was out of the country today and could not be reached for further comment. Stan Thigpen, a spokesman for Perot Systems, said that Mr. Meyerson had been accurately quoted by El Norte.


GRAPHIC: In his debate with Ross Perot, Vice President Gore raised the issue of a foreign trade zone in Fort Worth, Tex., operated by a company owned by Mr. Perot's family. Foreign trade zones are areas designated by the Commerce Department in which tariffs, which are taxes on imports, are waived to encourage business in or around the area.
Chart: "Advantages of Foreign Trade Zones"
Specifically, foreign trade zones allow American and foreign companies to save on Federal import taxes in various ways. The Perot family's foreign trade zone, which is designed to be a distribution hub for goods, has been granted permission for the first two ways. The Perot family has not asked permission to run factories in the zone, so the third method does not apply to it.
 
DELAYS SOME TAX PAYMENTS
If a company imports a widget from another country, stores it in the foreign trade zone for a month and then ships it to a store somewhere in the United States, the company does not have to pay import taxes until the widget leaves the trade zone. Without the trade zone, the company would have to pay the import taxes one month earlier, losing the use of that money.
 BENEFIT: Company earns interest on the duty for one month.
 
AVOIDS WAIT FOR TAX REFUND
If a company imports a widget from another country, stores it for a month in a foreign trade zone, and then reships it to another country, then it never pays taxes on the import. If the company stores the widget for a month outside of a foreign trade zone and then reships it, then the company must pay the tax when the widget arrives and then ask the Customs Service for a tax refund, known as a duty drawback, which can take half a year.
BENEFIT: Company earns interest on the duty for seven months.
 
LOWERS COMPONENT TAXES
If a company imports widgets, and uses them to build other gadgets inside the foreign trade zone, then the company can choose whichever tariff is lower, for widgets or gadgets.
 BENEFIT: Lower tarrifs.
 
IF THE NORTH AMERICAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT PASSES, import taxes would be eliminated on goods shipped from Mexico, eliminating the advantage of foreign trade zones for such imports. But the advantages of foreign trade zones could be increased for imports from other countries.

HEADLINE: JAPANESE PREMIER FACING MAJOR TEST

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 10

 BODY:
A hundred days after taking office and promising the most sweeping political change in postwar Japan, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa still enjoys the highest approval rating in the history of Japanese polling but faces a critical test within the next few days getting the first of his biggest reform plans approved by Parliament.
Mr. Hosokawa has said that he must get a broad political reform bill approved in at least one house of Parliament before traveling to Seattle to meet President Clinton and most of the leadership of Asia at a major economic conference next week. But the obstacles standing in the way loom large. 
Mr. Hosokawa's aides and colleagues say passage of the bill must be completed before they can move on a host of other promises -- including an economic package and reforming a bureaucracy grown bloated with power. Mr. Hosokawa has said that he would resign, or force another election, if the political reform ever fails. But as the deadline nears, Tokyo is awash with predictions of another outbreak of political turmoil, the second stage of what began last summer when the Liberal Democratic Party splintered after 38 years and paved the way for Mr. Hosokawa's coalition Government to come to power.
 
New Defections Foreseen
 Many predict more defections from the Liberal Democrats over the reform plan, one that threatens to vastly weaken the power of the rural voting base that has been the party's greatest strength. But there is also strong opposition to the plan from the Socialists, the biggest party within the Hosokawa Government. The Socialists fear that the plan may work against small parties, who therefore may also defect from the Government ranks. To survive, Mr. Hosokawa's coalition would have to quickly find new members from the ranks of the Liberal Democrats.
"The next few weeks will be the most critical period in the post-war political history of Japan," Hiroshi Kumagai, the Minister of Trade and Industry and an influential member of Mr. Hosokawa's cabinet, said the other day.
So far, Mr. Hosokawa is extending the olive branch, offering to compromise on details of the plan. He may have no choice, because even before the issue is settled he will be forced to wander into a political minefield every one of his predecessors has sidestepped: Agreeing to the opening of Japan's long-closed rice market.
At the same time, in Seattle, Mr. Hosokawa will meet with President Clinton and try to convince him that the changes underway in Japan will narrow its trade imbalance with the United States.
 
Premier's Prospects Improve
 But for all his problems, the straight-talking southern governor now appears to have a better hold on power than at any time since he came to office. People who predicted a six-month premiership for Mr. Hosokawa are now measuring his potential tenure in years.
His greatest strength is the weakness of the Liberal Democrats, who seem on the verge of collapse. Unaccustomed to life in the opposition, the party's elderly leaders are constantly bickering. The elaborate system of factions they built up over the decades is falling apart. Many fear that the reapportionment of seats, and the granting of greater power to urban voters, could mark the end of their careers.
But a group of conservative, long-time leaders of the party, like former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, seem openly unrepentant. In a recent interview he argued that Mr. Hosokawa's popularity "is not really substantiated by merit, competence and capability" but rather in "some nebulous expectation that something new might emerge."
Clearly, many younger members of the Liberal Democratic party disagree. A number are openly talking about abandoning ship in the next few weeks, so that they will be seen as reformers working alongside Mr. Hosokawa rather than as proteges of a dying generation of old-style politicians.
 
Threat of New Election
 On Tuesday the man who stitched together the seven-party coalition Government, Ichiro Ozawa, taunted the Liberal Democrats with the threat that he was ready to play his strongest card: Another election. If the Liberal Democrats block the electoral reform effort in coming days, he said, "we may have to ask the will of the people" for the second time in six months.
Few think that Mr. Ozawa, a master strategist, really wants an election yet. But with Mr. Hosokawa's Cabinet drawing approval ratings of 70 percent in the polls, the Liberal Democrats cannot risk it; they would almost certainly lose many of the seats they now hold -- and more young members of the party would defect.
One of the results of the endless scandals here is that virtually everyone in the political scene has to support political reform in public. But arguments have broken out over how the seats would be divided once Japan does away with its current system, in which each district is represented by three to six members of Parliament.
Under both the Government and opposition party's proposals the country would be divided in constituencies that would have only one representative. Currently, half or more of the candidates are endorsed by the Liberal Democrats, meaning they differentiated themselves by how much cash they could give out or what favors they could perform.

HEADLINE: Mexican Stocks Soar After TV Debate in U.S.

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Nov. 10

 BODY:
After what was widely seen here as a tough and effective defense of the North American Free Trade Agreement by Vice President Al Gore in Tuesday night's debate with Ross Perot, the Mexican stock market today turned in its strongest performance of the year.
The market's index rose 81.49 points -- 4.17 percent -- to reach a new high of 2,035. 
 Currency exchange rates also stabilized after a wild fluctuation on Tuesday that saw the Mexican peso, after months of comparative stability, drop 15 centavos against the dollar, a little more than 4 percent. Currency-exchange shops along the Mexican border with the United States stopped accepting pesos on Tuesday and closed at midday. The shops reopened today.
Despite the market's rebound, analysts, economists and bankers continue to predict substantial volatility in Mexico until at least next Wednesday, when the House is scheduled to vote in Washington on Nafta, the trade agreement grouping the United States, Canada and Mexico.
 
Flight of Americans Seen
 Many foreign investors are hedging against the risks of the next week by selling short-term Mexican Government Treasury notes or by not renewing them, at least until after the vote. Erick Berry, an analyst at Vector, a Mexico City financial consulting firm, said he believed that American citizens, rather than Mexicans, were those seeking to get out of the market.
Foreign investors may have withdrawn $3 billion to $5 billion from Mexico over the last few days, analysts said. In an attempt to lure back that money, the rate on the Mexican Treasury notes, known as cetes, was set at 17.23 percent this week, up from an average of 14.94 percent last week.
 
Turbulent Week Expected
 "Many investors decided they wanted to go into dollars while they wait out the Nafta vote," said Jonathan Heath, director general of Macro Asesoria Economica, another consulting firm here.
The Mexican stock exchange, the Bolsa Mexicana de Valores, has shadowed the progress of the trade agreement all year.
Yesterday, the market may also have been responding to other positive economic signs. Inflation figures for October showed a rate of four-tenths of 1 percent, the lowest monthly rate in 25 years.
And Paul Reichmann, the Canadian real estate developer who built Olympia & York, announced here today that he was investing in three office and retail projects valued at $1.5 billion, with backing from the New York investor George Soros.
By the end of the day, the peso was selling at 3.19 to a United States dollar, about the level before the plunge yesterday. Analysts said that uncertainty over the trade accord's chances of United States approval had led investors over the last few days to convert their peso investments to dollars, leading to a tide of selling and pressure on the exchange rate, and prompting the Mexican central bank to stop defending the peso at its longstanding ceiling against the dollar.
Rogelio Ramirez de la O, an economic consultant here, said that by 11 A.M. on Tuesday, there was "a moment almost of hysteria," when it was unclear what action, if any, the central bank would take to regain control.
The bank has established a band within which it allows the exchange rate to fluctuate. The ceiling now stands at 3.309 to the dollar. But to help an economic stabilization plan of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the central bank has in fact tried to keep the exchange rate somewhat better -- around 3.15 to the dollar -- where it has been most of the year.
On Tuesday morning, the bank decided to ignore the informal ceiling and allow the exchange rate to reflect to the real pressures of the market. That meant that if investors wanted to change pesos to dollars, they would have to turn over more of them.

HEADLINE: Its Economy Rising, Morocco Lures Investors

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RABAT, Morocco

 BODY:
For several weeks, Kerry Yeager, a project manager for the AES power corporation of Arlington, Va., has been hunkered down in a suite at the Hyatt here hammering out the terms of the biggest American investment ever in Morocco.
"We are coming here because Morocco is pro-Western, stable and has as good and sophisticated a group of people as I've ever met," Mr. Yeager said. 
 He has reason to be bullish. AES is about to ply close to $600 million into building a major thermal power plant and therefore has a keen interest in Morocco's stability. But it is not alone in taking a new look at Morocco, whose cheap labor, proximity to Europe and fast-growing population have prompted talk here of the potential similarities between Morocco's relationship to Europe and Mexico's to the United States.
After a decade of economic adjustment directed by the International Monetary Fund, Morocco has seen inflation reduced to 5.6 percent, tariffs cut and the foreign-debt burden lowered. So the argument, in essence, says Morocco is ripe for a wave of foreign investment to exploit both the growing domestic market and the potential for using the country as a low-cost base for exports to Europe.
Without that investment, Western officials here say, a demographic explosion expected to swell the population from 25 million to 40 million by early in the next century could prompt millions more Moroccans to cross the eight miles of water separating them from an increasingly xenophobic Europe.
Morocco appears to offer the best chance of an economic success story in North Africa. Its gross national product rose 4.5 percent a year from 1985 to 1991, and 3.5 percent in the last two years, when harvests were bad.
Already, foreign investment has risen fourfold in the five years to 1992, when it totaled $500 million. This year, the investment will be far higher as Spanish textile companies like Cortefiel have been moving production here because labor costs are at less than 25 percent of European levels.
Menaces lurk, however. In neighboring Algeria, the rise of militant Islamic fundamentalism has led to unrest that has claimed 3,000 lives over the last two years. While King Hassan of Morocco has kept a tight lid on similar movements in Morocco, and there is no sign of their making headway, the danger of a spillover persists.
Unemployment, about 16 percent, and illiteracy, about 55 percent, remain high. And fundamentalism has thrived on economic misery in both Egypt and Algeria. Aware of the danger, King Hassan has been trying to open the economy and pressing for closer links to the European Community.
Andre Azaulay, chief economic adviser to the King, said: "We are eight miles from Europe, and we want to be part of Europe. What we would eventually like is a full free trade zone with Europe, along the lines of the North American Free Trade Agreement."
After having initially scoffed at Morocco's interest in joining the community, Europe has sharpened interest in the country's economic and political stability because of the prospect of Algeria's turning into another Iran.
Meanwhile, Mr. Azaulay predicts fast progress on a privatization program devised in part to lessen Morocco's dependence on agriculture, which still accounts for over one fifth of its national output. The program involves the sale of 112 companies and is expected to raise about $2.2 billion.
A wide range of Moroccan businesses -- including mining, textile, paper, banks, insurance and hotels -- are on the block, and foreign investment is being encouraged.
One decisive stimulant to the economy could come if Morocco accords diplomatic recognition to Israel. There are more than 500,000 Jews of Moroccan descent in Israel, and many more in the United States and Canada. Mr. Azaulay, who is a Moroccan Jew, and other officials say they believe that these people would be ready to invest in Morocco if it recognizes Israel.
But Morocco is still a very long way from that. The King, while a persistent intermediary between Israel and Arab countries, is certain to move cautiously on Israel because he does not want to be seen to be betraying Arab claims to Jerusalem.

HEADLINE: THE FREE TRADE ACCORD: Beyond a Trade Pact;
The Issue: Should the U.S. Expand Its Economic and Political Influence?

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 10

 BODY:
The political debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement is not about tariffs or domestic content rules or side agreements on labor and the environment. It is not even mostly about trade with Mexico.
The debate is about matters much larger and more important. It is about whether, in the aftermath of the cold war, the United States will try to expand its economic and political influence around the world or whether it will withdraw within its borders and try to go it alone. And the debate is about the fate and frustrations of American workers, who have seen the number of good factory jobs decline and family incomes stagnate. 
 The trade agreement, in other words, is a symbol. It is more than a trade accord the way a nation's flag is more than a colored piece of cloth. It represents the enormous changes coursing through the American economy: increased competition from abroad, ever fewer blue-collar jobs, declining military industries, greater opportunities for workers with education, skills and knowledge of new technology.
These changes are extremely promising to some Americans and terrifying to others. That is why so much attention is being paid to an arcane measure that almost no one has tried to understand in detail.
 
U.S. Place in World Economy
 This is one of the first chances politicians have had to vote on a matter involving the place of the United States in the world economy since international communism ceased being the overriding threat to the nation's security.
And it is an opportunity for politicians to vent their anxiety about what is to become of workers in this country who have been mainstays of the middle class and who lack the education and perhaps the ability to master the sophisticated tools of the 21st century.
The trade agreement is bound to cost some jobs off the bat -- in the garment industry, for example. And it is sure to improve commerce around the Mexican border. So lawmakers with many garment workers will certainly vote against the measure, and those with districts along the Rio Grande will vote for it. But the greater tension is over what the agreement stands for rather than what it does.
Some politicians have been rather eloquent in addressing the symbolism.
In September, when President Clinton opened his campaign for Congressional approval of the trade pact, he declared, "This is a debate about whether we will embrace change and create the jobs of tomorrow, or try to resist those changes, hoping we can preserve the economic structure of yesterday."
 
'Seen too Many Jobs Lost'
 Last week, Representative David E. Bonior, the Michigan Democrat who is leading the drive against the trade pact, explained his position this way: "We have seen too many jobs lost. We have seen too many families uprooted. And we have seen too many communities destroyed the past 12 years."
In the television debate Tuesday night, Vice President Al Gore stacked the pact against some of the monumental judgments in American history. "Sometimes we do something right," Mr. Gore said. "The creation of NATO, the Louisiana Purchase. The purchase of Alaska. These were all extremely controversial decisions."
But Ross Perot saw the stakes differently. If the changes in the world economy are so encouraging, Mr. Perot asked: "Why is corporate America down-sizing? Why do we have the largest number of college graduates this year unable to find jobs since at any time since the '40's?
In point of fact, the trade agreement itself is of quite modest consequence in the whole scheme of the world economy and the American work force. Few Americans if any stand to strike gold or go broke depending on whether Congress votes next week to put the pact into effect.
But this is an instance in which the vote on a piece of legislation becomes disproportionately important because, coming at a turning point, the outcome could signify a change in direction or the continuation on a course.
In that respect, it is similar to the Civil Rights Act of 1957, the first civil rights law in this century. The actual provisions of that law -- creation of a Federal Civil Rights Commission, the authority for the Attorney General to seek court injunctions against obstructions of voting rights -- did little for the cause of black America. But its enactment was the first step toward the abolition of legal segregation in the United States.
Had Congress rejected this modest measure of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, it would have been crushing to the cause of civil rights.
Similarly, said Robert D. Hormats, a vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International, who has been a Government economic official under Democratic and Republican Presidents, rejection of the trade accord would be a more significant loss than just the defeat of a trade measure. "It would be devastating to American foreign policy," he said.
From the opposing point of view, there are also parallels between the trade accord and the civil rights legislation. Not that those against the trade agreement would have voted against civil rights. Far from it. The Congressional Black Caucus is opposed to the agreement.
But many of the opponents of free trade with Mexico are trying desperately to hang on to a vanishing way of life, much as were the white Southerners in the 1950's. In the case of the trade pact, it is completely understandable that they should want to do so.
One of the bases of the American middle class, once the envy of the world, has been the well-paying assembly-line jobs available to (mostly) men who were not skilled craftsmen and had nothing more than a high school education.
 
Fewer Workers Producing More
 Such jobs are rapidly disappearing -- not primarily because of trade competition and not primarily because American factories are moving abroad in search of cheap labor -- but because machines are replacing people. The number of manufacturing jobs in the United States decreased to 17.7 million last month from 19.4 million in 1970. But manufacturing output has doubled during that period. Fewer workers are producing more.
It is fine for economists whose jobs are not in jeopardy to say that such improved productivity is essential to long-term economic prosperity. And many legislators who agree with the economists will vote for the trade pact.
But improved productivity is little solace to workers whose own livelihoods are at stake, and in their behalf, many lawmakers will vote to reject the agreement.
Romano L. Mazzoli, a Democrat from Kentucky, said he was leaning toward voting for the measure. But he said he was not happy about it. "There's a real palpable fear," he said, "that Nafta signifies the beginning or continuation of a profound change -- that it'll never, never be like it was before. And with it comes the frustrations that you and I, with two or three college degrees, can't understand."

HEADLINE: State Dept. Seeking Funds of Other Agencies

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 10

 BODY:
Faced with the erosion of its foreign aid budget, the State Department has begun a campaign in the Administration to direct funds from other Federal agencies into foreign assistance programs.
A proposal being drawn up by top officials in the State Department will recommend to President Clinton that the Federal budget be revamped to channel funds from agencies like the Defense Department and the Drug Enforcement Agency into international programs. 
 State Department officials assert that with the demise of the Soviet Union and the threat of Communism, American foreign policy must concentrate on issues intertwined with domestic concerns, like the global environment, terrorism, narcotics trafficking and the development of markets for American goods.
In the new conditions, it makes little sense to maintain strict separation of domestic and international programs, the officials argue. In addition, they say funds earmarked for military assistance programs to foreign governments might also in future years be shifted more into foreign aid not related to defense.
Some State Department officials acknowledge, however, that the impetus for breaking down walls between domestic and international spending also stems from a realization that recent cuts in foreign aid are forcing severe cutbacks in international programs.
The State Department proposal is likely to touch off a turf battle between various Federal agencies and their protectors in Congress.
A first step toward this end is a new foreign aid bill being drafted by the State Department. The bill, which will be presented to Congress after the vote on the North American Free Trade Agreement, seeks to move away from allocating dollars on a country-by-country basis, and give the Administration flexibility to shift foreign aid dollars around to meet specific goals like building democracies or providing relief assistance.
An Administration official said that for the time being, certain foreign aid programs that are considered sacred cows, like aid to Israel, will not be affected.
 
A Trial Balloon
 The bill is a kind of trial balloon that even State Department officials call a "discussion draft" that could be modified to take into consideration objections raised by Congress and would affect only funds already controlled by the State Department.
But some officials make clear that they they envision eventually using the same kind of flexibility they hope to get from the new foreign aid bill to use funds that have been shifted from other Federal agencies into the foreign aid program.
The proposals being discussed at the State Department come at a time when levels of foreign and political support for it in Congress continue to plummet.
From a high in 1985 when foreign spending hit $18.5 billion, the amount budgeted for foreign assistance has fallen to $14.4 billion -- about one percent of total Federal spending -- in the current fiscal year.
With aid programs for Israel, Egypt and the former Soviet Union taking up about 40 percent of the foreign assistance budget, State Department planners find that other international programs, including those involving population stabilization, the environment and anti-drug programs are being squeezed.
In addition, the Administration last week told Congress that it intended to cut $458 million more in development assistance and economic support programs for foreign nations.
 
Aid Groups Alarmed
 The prospects of further deep cuts in foreign aid to help the Administration meet its deficit reduction targets has caused alarm among groups doing international relief and development work.
Last month, a letter signed by nearly 200 groups representing private relief agencies, environmentalist and religious and other charitable groups was sent to Mr. Clinton urging him to protect financing for international development programs.

Ski Apache draws 250,000 visitors annually, and the 440-room Inn of the Mountain Gods, with a convention center, golf course, Casino Apache and two artificial lakes, is humming.
What's next? A company that will store nuclear waste, if tribal elders get their way. The Governor of New Mexico, both houses of the Legislature, both Senators and all three Representatives are adamantly opposed, but because the tribe is a sovereign nation, such opposition may not stop them. There is little open opposition to the idea on the reservation, which expects enormous profits. 
 For a decade, the nuclear utilities and the Department of Energy have been looking for a few hundred acres, -- some place with not too many people but not too far from major transportation routes -- to store several thousand tons of high-level nuclear waste for a few decades, until a permanent repository is established.
The industry or the Government could pay tens of millions of dollars a year. That kind of money has attracted many inquiries, but only the Mescaleros have expressed serious interest. They see it as another way to use their 460,000-acre reservation to support the 3,400-member tribe.
 
Ancient Tribe, Modern Ills
 "We are looking for something so we can continue the tribe into perpetuity," said Fred Peso, one of eight members of the elected tribal council and the tribal official in charge of what the elders refer to as "the project." Nuclear waste storage could provide scores of jobs, many of them requiring far higher levels of professional training than the mill or the hotel demand.
The Mescaleros, descendants of Geronimo and Cochise and other Apaches who once ranged over a wide swath of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and the Mexican states of Sonora and Chihuahua, face a variety of problems today. They have a housing shortage, a high unemployment rate despite the businesses they already operate and vandalism so bad that at one point it forced the closing of the tribal store.
Many of the tribe's neighbors say a waste site could wipe out the economic base of nearby towns. "Western tourism and nuclear storage don't mix," said E. Frank Potter, a city councilman in Ruidoso, a skiing and resort center next to the reservation.
 
'We're Still Here'
 In the high desert and fir-covered mountains, the conflict has racial overtones. The Mescaleros accuse neighboring whites of condescension when they say that Washington is trying to impose radioactive waste on the Indians. "The state has always tried to tell the tribe what to do," said Silas Cochise, one of the elders and a great-grandson of the Apache warrior.
The debate also raises questions about the nature of long-lived radioactivity. The Indians say they have a sense of continuity with future generations and a stronger respect for the land than a governor or a corporate executive can claim. "We fought the Spanish, the Mexicans, the Texans, the U.S. Army," Mr. Peso said. "Even the Confederate Army came here. We fought with five nations and we're still here."
What little opposition exists within the tribe is subdued. The tribal council is employer, landlord, local government and family circle, so misgivings are voiced quietly. Whites who have had long associations with the Mescaleros say tribal politics is not much influenced by outsiders and, like family decisions, is driven by unseen factors.
In fact, tribal officials discourage discussions with outsiders. Wendell Chino, the president of the Tribal Council for the last 30 years, complained in a three-page letter sent to all members of the tribe in January 1992, that "using the white man's influence, T.V. and papers against your own people is not the Apache way."
 
Misgivings and Ghost Bullets
 To push the idea of accepting the waste, the tribal government converted an old laundromat into a nuclear information center, complete with geiger counter and sample radioactive materials, and a dummy nuclear fuel assembly. The tribe also distributed refrigerator magnets with the information center's phone number.
To explain ionizing radiation to older members of the tribe whose primary language is not English, Mr. Chino uses a phrase in Apache that means "ghost bullets."
Many people voice misgivings, although they refuse to be identified. "I don't want to start glowing in the dark in a couple of years," said one young Mescalero woman who works at a job off the reservation.
An older woman said she was torn. On one hand she was drawn to the allure of a long-lasting industry that would provide jobs to keep young people on the reservation and support traditional ceremonies and crafts. On the other, she was bothered by the uncertain meaning of "interim storage." The Department of Energy hopes to open a permanent repository at Yucca Mountain, in the desert near Las Vegas, early in the next century. But Nevada is fighting hard to stop it, and the site may prove unsuitable. "Yucca Mountain is holding back, and they may never find a place for it," she said.
 
Voters Reject Dissidents
 Mr. Chino's opponent in the tribe's most recent election, Rufina Marie Laws, said there were religious objections to the project: "We were given this land by the Great Spirit. The ground we walk on is the same ground as our forefathers walked upon."
Ms. Laws said relatives had pleaded with her not to campaign against the waste site, fearing reprisals against the family. She said she had gone forward because she had had a dream in which a stream of iridescent water came down off the mountain and killed everything in its path.
In tribal elections on Nov. 3, Mr. Chino defeated Ms. Laws 391 to 176. Mr. Peso was elected vice president, defeating Donalyn Torres, another opponent of the plan, 333 to 211.
Tribal elders and outside engineers -- some from the nuclear industry and some who are industry critics -- say the installation the Mescaleros are considering would entail very little risk, if any.
 
Question of Appearances
 Used, highly radioactive nuclear fuel would arrive in sealed steel containers. But it would be in solid form, no longer generating enough heat to require water cooling, so there would be no liquid to leak and no pumps or valves or other mechanical systems to fail.
But that may not be the point. "Whether or not it is safe is not as big a question as the appearance," said H. John Underwood, the city attorney of Ruidoso and the area's state representative.
Last winter a group in Ruidoso gathered signatures on a petition to oppose the storage site. They planned to march to the reservation to deliver it, but Mr. Chino, the tribal president, threatened to close the ski area if they did. The opponents gave up the march.
In August, the Mescaleros applied for a final grant of $2.8 million from the Department of Energy to study whether the tribe should volunteer for the job. Over the years, 29 tribes and counties, including the Mescaleros, have applied for grants of $100,000 or $200,000, but most have dropped out. The Mescaleros were the first to seek the final grant.
The grants are available under a Federal law that invites states, counties and Indian tribes to negotiate with the Government for a temporary or permanent site. According to the Department of Energy, a sovereign Indian tribe would not need state permission, but Congress and the President would have to approve.
 
State Circles Its Wagons
 The Governor and New Mexico's Congressional delegation were horrified. Senator Jeff Bingaman led the successful push for an amendment to the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act that eliminated financing for the grant for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1.
But the Indians are not deterred. The tribe is studying two areas on the slopes of the Sierra Blanca. When the light is right, the tops of the ski area's chairlifts are visible from the sites, 40 miles north of Alamogordo, N.M., where the first atomic bomb was tested in July 1945.
Nationally and in New Mexico, some environmentalists say they will fight the idea because it means putting more nuclear waste on the roads and rails than is absolutely necessary. But advocates of interim storage argue that the only alternative to one location with casks full of spent fuel is scores of such locations around the country, some in places far more populous or environmentally fragile than this area.
The Mescaleros say they may not need Congressional approval at all. If the Government does not build a repository, they say, they may strike a deal with a consortium of investor-owned utilities. Experts in the nuclear industry say that Commonwealth Edison in Illinois, and Northern States Power in Minnesota are likely candidates.
Whatever the claims of opponents, Mr. Chino explains his outlook this way: "The Navajos make rugs. The Pueblos make pottery. And the Mescaleros make money."

HEADLINE: House G.O.P. Proposes 'Tough Love' Welfare Requiring Recipients to Work

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 10

 BODY:
House Republicans struck first today in what promises to be a divisive debate over welfare, unveiling a plan they called "tough love" to make welfare recipients spend 35 hours a week working off their benefits.
With the White House drafting its own welfare proposals, the Republicans staked out a position that portrayed the nation's five million welfare families as an indolent lot in need of a moral tonic. 
 "You can't maintain civilization with 12-year-olds having babies and 15-year-olds killing each other and 17-year-olds dying of AIDS," said Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the minority whip.
The Republicans called the work proposal a compassionate idea that would give the downtrodden the incentive to change. But they also recognized that change would not come cheaply and they proposed spending up to $6 billion a year.
They proposed raising the money by cutting food programs and barring immigrants from welfare assistance, provisions almost certain to be opposed by the Democrats.
The plan offered a preview of the volatile politics likely to surround next year's debate, as advocacy groups leapt to denounce the plan's emphasis on personal morality rather than the weak state of the national economy.
 
Accusation of Racism
 "It's racist," said Sonia Perez, a policy analyst at the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic advocacy group. She said the plan unfairly made immigrants targets and blamed minorities for high rates of single motherhood.
The Administration reacted cautiously, issuing a statement pledging to work with Congress on a bipartisan basis. But Representative Harold E. Ford, Democrat of Tennessee, who heads a Ways and Means subcommittee with jurisdiction over the plan, dismissed it as "negative and punitive."
President Clinton's pledge to impose a strict, two-year limit on welfare benefits was one of his most popular campaign themes and a large part of his claim to represent new Democratic thinking. But he has yet to specify what he has in mind.
An Administration plan being written for release next winter is likely to be shorter on penalties and longer on the expansions of social services, like job training and child care.
Distributing a series of Clinton campaign pledges on welfare, the Republicans warned they would attack any Democratic plan they found to be too permissive as backsliding.
"I hope the President means what he says," said Representative Rick Santorum, Republican of Pennsylvania.
The handouts accompanying the Republican plan said the two fundamental causes of welfare were the high rates of out-of-wedlock births and the failure of welfare recipients to seek jobs. Many scholars say the shortage of remunerative jobs for people with few skills is a third factor.
 
Two-Year Deadline
 Representative E. Clay Shaw Jr., Republican of Florida, acknowledged that some regions had high unemployment but argued that even then "it doesn't mean that you don't have jobs."
The Republican plan, endorsed by party leaders, would give welfare recipients up to two years to take advantage of the education and training programs that already exist.
At the end of the two years, however, the mothers would have to work 35 hours a week to continue benefits.
The plan envisions two kinds of work programs: community service at a public or nonprofit agency, or a job at a private business that receives a Government subsidy. But they would pay no wage other than the continuation of welfare benefits.
States could end all benefits if recipients still had not found real jobs after three years on the work program.
Parents who failed to comply would have their aid reduced, with three infractions resulting in the cessation of all cash assistance.
The plan also seeks to increase child support collections and deny any cash assistance to a mother who fails to identify a father.
Mr. Santorum and the bill's other sponsors argued that the work experience would enable welfare recipients to develop skills and resumes that would make them more appealing to potential employers. But research in the area is at best inconclusive.
A recent report by the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation, a nonprofit group, looked at past community work experiments and found "there is little evidence that unpaid work experience leads to consistent employment" or higher earnings.
The Republicans tried to portray their bill as an expansion of opportunity to needy people. But they also portrayed welfare recipients in almost uniformly negative terms.
"Some women on welfare are more consumed with the feeding of their drug habit than the gut instinct to feed their children," said Representative Nancy Johnson of Connecticut.
Gary Franks, Republican of Connecticut, who said he had relatives on welfare, talked of "taxpayer dollars going into the hands of drug dealers."

HEADLINE: THE FREE TRADE ACCORD;
Cuomo Says He Won't Support Trade Pact

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Nov. 10

 BODY:
After refusing for months to take a firm position on the North American Free Trade Agreement, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York said today that he could not support the proposed treaty in its current form.
Mr. Cuomo's announcement came at an impromptu news conference a week before the House of Representatives is to vote on the trade agreement. Almost all 31 members of the House from New York had already taken a stand on the issue. 
 Twenty-one oppose the agreement, while four favor it and six are undecided. More than 40 governors support the agreement.
In recent appearances, Mr. Cuomo has praised the concept of a free trade agreement, even calling the one under discussion "a terrific idea" in a speech to the American Bankers Association in San Diego on Saturday. But he has also asked, as he did on the "Charlie Rose" program on PBS on Tuesday, "Is this the best deal, and is this moment the time to make it?"
 
Request for Analysis
 Mr. Cuomo said in that interview with Mr. Rose that he would not take a stand until he received an analysis of the agreement's potential effect on jobs in New York from the state's Department of Economic Development. But today, after being criticized in news reports for the ambiguity of his position, he announced his opposition before receiving that analysis.
"At this moment, I don't see how I can support it because there is not evidence for me to support it now," Mr. Cuomo said. "It will be good for business. But there is no evidence that it produces jobs for us. And there is some evidence that it will cost us jobs."
Mr. Cuomo said the trade agreement might be good for New York in the long run. But, he said, "I govern in the short term as well," adding that the greatest short-term need in New York was for jobs.
Mr. Cuomo said New York had been hurt disproportionately by several recent Federal decisions, including Medicare cuts and tax increases in this year's budget and military base closings in the state. He suggested implicitly that he could not support President Clinton, a fellow Democrat, on the trade accord unless the state received financial help in other areas.
"I'm for some kind of free trade agreement because you have to compete with the European Community, you have to compete with the East," Mr. Cuomo said. "But does it have to be at this moment, because I have all these impacts? Are you offering us something?"

HEADLINE: Louis Banks, 77, Dies; An Editor for Time Inc.

 BODY:
Louis Banks, a former managing editor of Fortune magazine and former editorial director of Time Inc., died on Sunday at his home in Naples, Fla. He was 77.
The cause was congestive heart failure, Fortune said in a statement issued yesterday. 
 Mr. Banks started at Time in 1945 as a correspondent in the Los Angeles bureau. He was chief editor of Fortune from 1965 to 1970 and, as editorial director from 1970 to 1973, he held the second highest editorial position at Time Inc.
He helped launch a number of new ventures, most notably Money magazine. He retired as a member of the corporate board in 1987 when he reached the age of 70.
Mr. Banks was born in Pittsburgh and raised in Southern California, where he graduated in economics from U.C.L.A. During World War II, he served as a Navy pilot in the Pacific with the rank of lieutenant.
In 1969 he took a sabbatical to study at Harvard University as a Nieman Research Fellow. He returned to Time Inc. when he was offered the editorial director's post along with a seat on the company's board.
In 1973 he became a visiting professor at Harvard's Graduate School of Business Administration.
Mr. Banks is survived by his wife, Mary Campbell Banks; four sons, Robert L., William C. and Theodore R.; a daughter, Margaret Banks Czekaj, and eight grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Consumer Prices, Reflecting New Gasoline Tax, Rise 0.4%

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 10

 BODY:
Reflecting a higher gasoline tax and other special factors, consumer prices climbed four-tenths of 1 percent in October, the biggest advance in six months, the Labor Department reported today.
The rise in the Consumer Price Index, which followed an unchanged reading for September, was widely regarded as a statistical anomaly and not a sign that the recent pickup in economic activity was heating up inflation. 
 "The tax increase had a one-time effect," said Brian S. Wesbury, an economist at Griffin, Kubik, Stephens & Thompson, a Chicago investment house. "Over all, the numbers confirm that inflation remains moderate."
In another report, the department found that first-time claims for unemployment insurance rose a surprising 14,000 last week, to 354,000, the highest level in more than three months. The four-week moving average, which is considered a more reliable indicator of labor-market conditions, moved up 2,500, to 348,250.
While today's inflation report was not as unexpectedly favorable as Tuesday's survey of prices at the producer level, which declined two-tenths of 1 percent in October, it showed that underlying, or core, inflation eased to 3 percent in the latest 12 months. This is the best year-over-year performance since the early 1970's, when the Nixon Administration imposed price controls.
Nonetheless, bond prices fell and long-term interest rates rose in the credit markets. Traders said that the surprisingly favorable producer price figures released on Tuesday had raised expectations in the market that consumer prices would also show weakness.
The underlying inflation rate, which rose three-tenths of 1 percent in October, does not include food and energy, which bounce around from month to month, often because of extreme weather.
Indeed, food prices in grocery stores spurted eight-tenths of 1 percent last month, the biggest rise since August 1992. The advance was concentrated in fresh fruit prices, which rose 18.1 percent in the last four months.
The effect of higher energy prices was felt mainly in the transportation sector, where prices rose 1 percent last month, the most in three years.
Gasoline prices, which had fallen for seven straight months, jumped 4.5 percent as the 4.3-cent increase in the Federal gasoline tax took effect on Oct. 1. Demand was apparently strong enough to allow service stations to pass most of the extra tax on to customers.
New cars, which fell 3.9 percent at the producer level, rose four-tenths of 1 percent at retail, with about 30 percent of the sample consisting of 1994 models. Used cars climbed six-tenths of 1 percent to a level 8.3 percent above that of October 1992.
Medical costs rose five-tenths of 1 percent, the biggest increase since May, bringing the 12-month gain to 5.7 percent, the report showed.
Among the five big metropolitan areas for which October figures were published today, prices rose the least in New York, edging up just one-tenth of 1 percent. Prices rose three-tenths of 1 percent for Chicago and San Francisco, five-tenths of 1 percent for Los Angeles and seven-tenths of 1 percent for Philadelphia.
For the first 10 months of the year, the C.P.I. for urban consumers has advanced at a 2.8 percent pace, about the same as for all of 1992.
"We have modest inflation, and I think the downtrend is going to remain intact," said Carl J. Palash, economist at MCM Money Watch, a New York advisory firm. He predicted that the year-over-year rate would fall to less than 3 percent, to perhaps 2.5 percent, in the first half of 1994.
Still another report, one partly derived from the price data, showed today that real average weekly earnings rose three-tenths of 1 percent last month, recovering part of the September decline of eight-tenths of 1 percent.
Hourly earnings rose five-tenths of 1 percent and hours worked rose three-tenths of 1 percent. But inflation -- as measured by an alternate C.P.I. -- reduced buying power by five-tenths of 1 percent.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
A Fight for Green Point's Pot of Gold

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL

 BODY:
In the 125 years since it was founded, Green Point Savings Bank of Flushing, Queens, has accumulated a giant pot of gold -- retained earnings of $758 million.
Under the arcane rules governing mutual savings banks like Green Point, the pot of gold is nominally owned by depositors, but in reality owned by no one. The pot of gold is why Green Point is in the middle of a takeover battle with Republic New York Corporation of Manhattan. 
 Claiming that pot of gold was one reason behind Green Point managers' announcement in July that the bank would convert to a shareholder-owned corporation in an initial public offering worth $600 million to $800 million, the largest such conversion to date.
Their deal would give insiders 30 percent of the company and would make all top management and trustees millionaires. For example, Thomas Johnson, Green Point's chairman, would get about $2 million in stock outright and options on $4 million more. A former president of the Manufacturers Hanover Corporation, he was hired in August.
Last Friday, however, Republic upended Green Point's plans. It proposed to acquire Green Point, paying nothing for it directly, but offering a $100 million special interest payment to depositors. Republic has acquired the Manhattan Savings Bank and the Williamsburg Savings Bank on similar terms.
The nasty war of words that has ensued represents the fervor of people fighting over the keys to a treasure chest.
"They are looking for a loophole to get something for nothing," Mr. Johnson said about Republic.
Jeffrey C. Keil, Republic's president, in turn, criticized the large awards of stock and options that would go to Green Point management and trustees: "The whole thing is a scheme to enrich insiders," he said.
To be fair, these compensation programs are similar to other conversions of mutual savings banks, although the dollar amounts are higher, since Green Point is the largest such conversion. Moreover, these awards vest over five to ten years.
As for getting something for nothing, the two proposals offer the same windfall to the eventual acquirer: an institution with a book value of at least $1.2 billion for a contribution of equity of about $700 million.
Who should get this windfall? The relevant law was not written to deal with this situation. Essentially, it is up to the bank's board of trustees to decide, although the standard they should apply is far from clear.
On this point, the regulators obfuscate. The state Banking Department approved the Green Point plan last week, but in response to a query by Republic, Elizabeth Tibbals, the department's deputy superintendent and counsel, wrote to both banks that the trustees were obligated to act "in a manner that is consistent with their roles as fiduciaries, although the Banking Department will not attempt to describe or define the scope of such fiduciary duties."
The Green Point trustees' main objective is to preserve Green Point's independence, Mr. Johnson said: "It is our absolute conviction that this bank should be preserved and not incorporated within some other bank that would change it and hurt it."
Mr. Keil, Republic's president, responds that because Republic is bigger, it can offer Green Point customers a broader range of services.
The other difference between the two plans is how they affect the depositors. Under the management plan, each depositor would have the right to buy up to $1.75 million in stock in the offering, stock that would be otherwise hard to find. Republic would offer its stock to depositors at the market price, which is no real benefit, but give them a share of the $100 million special interest payment, about 2 percent of deposits.
Unlike proxy battles for public companies, Green Point's depositors are largely left on the sidelines. They must vote whether to approve management's plan, but Republic is not allowed to submit an alternative to them. A lawsuit has been filed on behalf of depositors, with Republic's assistance, seeking to get the trustees to consider Republic's bid.
All of this begs the question of whether Green Point needs to convert to stock ownership at all. As a public company, it can issue more stock to raise capital or make acquisitions. On the other hand, the bank is overcapitalized now and would be much more so after the Green Point offering. Ronald S. Riggins, who conducted the appraisal for the offering, says the bank's return on equity would fall to a meager 6.8 percent.
After converting from mutual status in public offerings, many savings banks, in fact, have started buying back their stock with their extra capital. This, not so coincidentally, increases the share of the company's stock held by insiders.
For this and other reasons, depositors thinking of investing should exercise caution. Green Point has essentially one business: It attracted deposits with above-average interest rates and lent them as home mortgages, to borrowers who offered little or no documentation of their income.
But as the New York area fell into recession and still struggles out of it, Green Point's delinquent loans and loan losses have increased sharply.
The numbers do not necessarily paint a disaster in the making, but Green Point's record of steadily increasing earnings in recent years could well be broken by a spike in loan losses.


GRAPHIC: Because it is a mutual savings bank, Green Point Savings' retained earnings of $758 million are essentially owned by no one. Two groups, Green Pont's management and trustees led by Green Point's chairman, Thomas S. Johnson (photo), and the Republic New York Corporation under its chairman, Jeffrey C. Keil (photo), have offered competing plans to find an owner for the bank and its capital hoard.
 
GREEN POINTS TRUSTEES'S PLAN
Chart/Photos: "Who Gets a Savings Bank's Hoard?"
 CONVERSION FROM MUTUAL TO STOCK OWNERSHIP. New stock worth $600 million to $800 million would be sold.
 TOP INSIDERS GRANTED STOCK AND OPTIONS. Trustees and top executives would be given $1 million to $2 million worth of stock each over 6 to 10 years, plus the right to buy another $1 million to $4 million worth at the offering price (probably lower than the market price) over 5 years, representing a total of up to 15 percent of the bank's stock.
 15% BOUGHT FOR EMPLOYEES. An employee stock ownership plan would buy $70 million worth of shares at the offering price, and up to $35 million more on the open market.
 DEPOSITORS CAN BUY UP TO 0.25% EACH. Most depositors do not buy many shares in stock conversions, but professional investors have opened small deposit accounts in order to cash in. Trustees and executives are depositors too; they said they will buy $4.145 million of the stock set aside for depositors.
 THE PUBLIC CAN BUY WHATEVER IS LEFT. $180 million has been reserved for institutional investors, the rest will be sold to individuals chosen by the bank.
 
REPUBLIC'S PLAN
 A MERGER, OF SORTS. Since Green Point has no owners, Republic would simply absorb its capital, assets and liablities.
 BONUS FOR DEPOSITORS. Those who stay with Green Point for a year would divide a $100 million special interest payment, about 2 percent of the total deposits.
 COMPENSATION FOR INSIDERS. Executives and trustees would all keep their jobs and get compensation comparable to what they would get in the public offering.
 MORE REPUBLIC STOCK ISSUED. Republic would sell about $700 in its stock and add the proceeds to Green Point's capital.

HEADLINE: Goal: Integration by Consensus;
Weak Gesture or Trojan Horse? Connecticut Is Divided

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD

 BODY:
Connecticut is about to call on its 169 towns and cities to do what no state has ever asked: to cooperate in creating, from the local level up, a statewide plan for integrating public schools.
To some parents and politicians, the planning exercise, mandated by a law enacted in the spring, is a Trojan horse being hammered together to force racial quotas and busing on their communities. To others, it is a weak gesture at bridging the racial and economic gaps that divide the state's poor cities from their wealthy suburbs. 
 All Jack Hasegawa has to do is bring everyone together to discuss, very publicly, one of the most sensitive issues in American life, and make the process work.
Mr. Hasegawa, until last month the director of Dwight Hall, a community-service center for students at Yale University, is the sole full-time employee hired by the state to set in motion the law, "An Act Improving Educational Quality and Diversity."
Looking at his new surroundings, an isolated cubicle in the State Department of Education with little more than a desk and a telephone, he sees perhaps the best answer to fears that the law's language conceals a plan to impose school desegregation. There is no one to do that.
"The legislature really meant it, for once, when it said we're going to do this as a locally directed process," Mr. Hasegawa said in an interview. "As far as I can tell, this may be the only time that a state has said, we have to do a basic education reform and we're going to do it by going out to the citizens and asking them to do it."
The law lays out a firm timetable for every community to take part in an unfamiliar process, defined by code words ("quality," "barriers to opportunity," "student diversity") that can mean different things to different people.
Republicans, who opposed the law in the General Assembly, intend to make it a central issue in next year's legislative elections, and are already distributing materials that sharply dispute its intent.
In the end, whether any community takes part in magnet schools, or exchanges of students or teachers across district lines, or any other plan, remains up to each city or town, not the state.
So Mr. Hasegawa's role is in many ways like that of a guide leading a large and prickly contingent of strangers through new territory. There is a deadline, there is a need for order, but the destination is uncertain and not his to decide. He can only point out features of the land that might help people decide where they want to end up.
Mr. Hasegawa, 49, has made his own journey through a diverse world. He grew up in a Japanese-American farm community in California, took part in civil-rights protests in the South, was inspired by black church leaders to attend divinity school, worked with street gangs in Boston, and eventually spent several years working and teaching in Japan, where as a fourth-generation American he learned the language of his great-grandfather.
Having worked with Yale students of all backgrounds meeting people unlike themselves for the first time, hearing his 11-year-old son tell of unpleasant encounters in his suburban school in Woodbridge, Mr. Hasegawa says, "It's unnatural in Connecticut for us to have children in class with kids who are fundamentally different in color or ethnicity."
 
'A Common Interest'
 He says the essence of his new job is "the ability to create community, the ability to help people see that they have a common interest in this question of quality and diversity."
"There are a lot of people who don't trust that the law means what it says," Mr. Hasegawa said, "who believe that somehow down the road their kids will have to be bused."
"But the Commissioner of Education has said over and over, if busing comes, it will be the result of a local plan, or because people feel there is a better opportunity at the end of the bus ride, or because a court orders it. It will not come out of the department's planning process."
A court order is a possibility because of a lawsuit known as Sheff v. O'Neill, which seeks to integrate Hartford's schools with those of 21 suburbs. Long-delayed final arguments are set for Dec. 16, and a decision by Superior Court Judge Harry Hammer is expected in the spring.
 
Asking Local Boards
 The law calls on local school boards to appoint advisory committees and then propose what their communities could contribute to regional plans to improve and integrate public schools. Almost 80 percent of the students in Connecticut's cities are black or Hispanic, while most suburban districts are 90 percent to 95 percent white.
Eleven regional forums will draft the plans, which the Commissioner of Education can comment on, but not reject. Approval is up to the school boards and governing bodies in the communities. Even then, towns can refuse to participate.
The process officially begins in January, when the Institute for Public Service at the University of Connecticut will convene the forums. Mr. Hasegawa and the institute staff, however, are already deeply into their planning, knowing that the success of the process will depend greatly on how they start it off.
"Every region will be free to do its own thing, but we'll have some suggestions on how to proceed," said the institute's director, Howard Rifkin. "We're going through this constant debate on how much guidance is too much and will be perceived as trying to force certain solutions."
"I've been to a lot of meetings where people are trying to set up the us-against-them mentality," he said. "I tell them, this is about you. It's not about the institute or the Department of Education defining anything."
 
Italicized Options
 To build consensus, Mr. Hasegawa and Mr. Rifkin have consulted with several statewide groups on how to organize the process. In suggesting ways to proceed, or options for meeting a goal, Mr. Hasegawa said, "We find ourselves using things like italics, to say, "one possible way.' "
In this month's school-board elections, the law did not appear to be an issue, said Terry P. Cassidy, executive director of the Connecticut Association of Boards of Education, which has conducted several meetings on the law for its members.
"I haven't heard anyone say, 'We will not do this.' I haven't heard anyone say it's a bad idea. I've heard them all recognizing that we have to give every child a chance."
What does concern school boards, Mr. Cassidy said, is how they will build support for the regional plans in their communities, and the unanswered question of whether the state will help pay for new schools, new programs or transportation that the plans propose.
The Republican Party has already sent its legislators material for letters warning constituents that the law portends mandatory busing, regional tax districts and desegregation plans forced on towns.
"It's not something that's of great concern to people at this moment, but I think this is the major issue for next year," said State Representative Daniel F. Caruso, a Republican from Fairfield who sent a mailing on the law to his district.
Mr. Hasegawa's advice to those concerned about the law is to take part in the process. There will be advisory groups. All meetings will be open. There will be public hearings.
"The fear is, isn't there a hidden agenda?" he said. "The right question should be, how can I be involved?"

HEADLINE: Cyclicals Set the Pace, With Dow Up by 23.48

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
Surmounting its gnawing fear of rising interest rates, the stock market yesterday cobbled together its first major rally in more than a week.
The Dow Jones industrial average rode a wave of buying in stocks of the cyclicals, companies whose earnings are sensitive to changes in the economy. The index rose 23.48 points, to 3,663.55, its biggest increase since late October. Technology issues were also strong, propelled by an encouraging report from a trade group on semiconductor sales. 
 Yesterday's gains came despite a slump in the bond market that was apparently touched off by the Government's report that consumer prices climbed four-tenths of 1 percent in October, the biggest advance in six months.
A faltering bond market -- and a resulting jump in bond yields -- has repeatedly pulled down the stock market in recent weeks because some investors fear that people seeking better returns on their investments will switch from equities to fixed-rate securities, analysts said.
But yesterday, stock investors seemed to home in on parts of the Government's inflation report indicating that the economy was expanding without creating major price increases. Many economists noted that the four-tenths of 1 percent rise was an anomaly influenced by the new Federal gas tax of 4.3 cents.
"The report hinted that some pricing power is being restored, and that's good for stocks," said Hugh Johnson, the chief investment officer at the First Albany Corporation. "Because of some strengthening in the economy, corporations are recovering their ability to raise prices."
Mr. Johnson said the market was also buoyed by Vice President Al Gore's performance against Ross Perot during the debate on the North American Free Trade Agreement on Tuesday night.
 
Market Seems to Favor Nafta
 The market seems to favor the accord because many companies believe they will benefit from it. Mr. Gore's apparent success also helped American depository receipts of Mexican companies in yesterday's trading. Telefonos de Mexico was the second-most-active stock on the Big Board, rising 1 7/8, to 52 3/8.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was better than average at 283.45 million shares, up from 276.4 million shares on Tuesday. Advancing issues led declining issues by about 4 to 3.
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 3.39 points, to 463.72. The American Stock Exchange composite index was up 0.68 point, to 476.70. And the Nasdaq composite index jumped 6.66 points, to 776.50.
The cyclicals led yesterday's gains, particularly the auto, mining, paper and chemical issues.
General Motors rose 2 1/2, to 51 1/8; Ford was up 7/8, to 61 3/4, and Chrysler edged up 3/8, to 55 1/4.
Besides G.M., the other cyclicals that contributed to the rise in the Dow Jones industrials were Alcoa, up 1 3/8, to 69 3/4; Bethlehem Steel, up 1 1/4, to 17 5/8; International Paper, up 1 1/8 to 62 5/8; Allied Signal, up 7/8, to 71 7/8, and Caterpiller, up 7/8 to 90 7/8.
A report from the Semiconductor Industry Association on growing semiconductor sales bolstered the stocks of technology companies. Intel was the most active issue on the Nasdaq, rising 2 1/2, to 63 1/2. Texas Instruments surged 4, to 63 1/8, and National Semiconductor jumped 1 3/4, to 17 7/8.
Among other technology stocks, I.B.M. rose 3/4, to 49 7/8, Compaq shot up 2 1/4, to 68, and Oracle Systems was up 1, to 31 1/2.

Bonds Retreat on Price Index Rise

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The bond market retreated yesterday and long-term interest rates rose after the Government reported news on inflation that disappointed traders and investors.
The rise in October consumer prices of four-tenths of a percent matched most analysts' forecasts. It was caused mostly by a big jump in gasoline prices, which surged as Federal taxes rose 4.3 cents a gallon. 
 But in the wake of Tuesday's unexpectedly good producer price figures, traders said expectations had been raised. "There was hope that the Consumer Price Index would perform better," said Steven Saslow, an executive managing director at Carroll McEntee & McGinley. "Accounts wanted to see a more favorable number to justify buying back securities they probably sold over the last month."
 
Rally on Tuesday
 On Tuesday, the unexpected drop of two-tenths of a point in the October Producer Price Index caused bond prices to rally by about 3/4 point. But those gains were completely wiped out yesterday.
By late in the day, the Treasury's 6 1/4 percent 30-year bond was offered at a price of 10025/32 , down 25/32 , to yield 6.20 percent, up from 6.14 percent late Tuesday.
"We aren't going to see a lot more declines in inflation," said Donald Ratajczak, director of the economic forecasting project at Georgia State University. "But we will see better numbers than we had for October. Basically, we are on a 3 percent inflation path."
The consumer price data also quelled demand among investors for the $12 billion worth of 10-year Treasury notes that were auctioned yesterday. The auction was the second and final leg of the Treasury's autumn refunding.
Traders said that much of the issue, which was auctioned at an average yield of 5.69 percent, was bought by speculative accounts. At the last 10-year auction on Aug. 11, the securities were sold at an average yield of 5.78 percent.
Late yesterday, the new 10-year notes were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 5.69 percent.
 
Managers Turn Cautious
 The disappointing consumer price figures were the most obvious apparent cause of the selloff yesterday. But traders and analysts said the session's results were also symptomatic of a market in which money managers, approaching the end of the year with substantial profits in their pockets, were turning cautious.
"People are defending their profits," said one Government securities trader. "The same thing happened last year, and with the economy looking stronger, people are getting very, very careful."
Ward McCarthy, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a bond market research firm in Princeton, N.J., said that weekly surveys of money managers conducted by the firm showed that since mid-October these accounts had substantially reduced their exposure to longer-term notes and bonds, which are more volatile than shorter-term securities.
"It makes sense for them to do that, because they have had a heck of a year," Mr. McCarthy said. "Right now there is very little reward for taking on more risk."
Prices of shorter-term Treasury issues also fell yesterday, but not as much as bonds.
By late yesterday, the 4 3/4 percent five-year notes were offered in late trading at a price of 9821/32 , down 1/4 point, to yield 5.06 percent. And the 3 7/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 99 1/2, down 2/32 , to yield 4.14 percent. Treasury bill rates were little changed.
 
Corporate Activity Slow
 In the corporate bond market, new-issue activity, which was heavy on Tuesday, ground to a virtual halt yesterday. The consumer price figures and the Veterans Day holiday persuaded underwriters to leave new issues on their shelves.
In the tax-exempt municipal bond market, the day's biggest offering was a competitive sale of $310 million worth of sales tax revenue bonds for the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transit Authority. A bid from a group led by Goldman, Sachs & Company won the issue.
Serial bonds were reoffered with yields from 4.05 percent in 1997 to 5.35 percent in 2013. And term bonds maturing in 2023 were priced to yield 5.50 percent.
The issue is insured by the Ambac Indemnity Corporation, and carries an AAA rating from both Moody's Investors Service and the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of 10-year Treasury notes:

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Drops Despite Report Showing Increased Inflation

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar fell against the yen and other currencies yesterday after the American currency failed to rally on a Government report showing higher inflation.
Rumors that the Federal Reserve was buying dollars for the Bank of Japan helped the dollar recover from its worst levels, although traders said they saw no signs that the United States central bank was in the market. 
 The dollar fell to 107.20 yen in late New York trading, from 107.95 on Tuesday. In Tokyo, the dollar fell to 107.88 yen from Tuesday's close of 107.97 yen.
Gold bullion rose 80 cents an ounce, to $377.40 for the December contract, on the Commodity Exchange in New York.
The yen gained against most currencies on signs that Japanese buyers were liquidating foreign assets, which supported the yen.
 
 
'Good Buying'
 "There was good buying of yen across the board on talk of repatriation of offshore assets by Japanese investors," Richard Koss, director of foreign exchange sales for CIBC, said. "The Japanese also sold European assets."
The dollar ended at 1.6892 German marks in late New York trading, down from 1.6925 marks on Tuesday. Earlier, it fell to 1.6925 marks in London from the Tuesday close of 1.6957 marks.
In United States trading, the dollar declined initially after the Government said the overall Consumer Price Index rose four-tenths of 1 percent in October, and three-tenths of 1 percent for the core rate, excluding food and energy. The dollar ignored a sharp rise in credit market interest rates in response to the consumer price rise.
"The C.P.I. was more or less in the bounds of expectations and had a low level of impact," Chris Bourdain, a corporate foreign exchange trader at Credit Suisse, said.
Failure to push the dollar higher sparked selling.
"People are beginning to question how long the bullish sentiment in the dollar will survive," Mr. Koss said. "It's liable to persist, but some may start to figure the path of least resistance is lower," he said.
The Mexican peso ended firmer against the dollar, recouping some of its sharp losses of Tuesday amid growing optimism about the prospects for the North American Free Trade Agreement.

HEADLINE: China Austerity Drive Is Hurting U.S. Ventures

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SHENYANG, China

 BODY:
Last summer, when thousands of regional Communist Party bankers were printing money to finance their capitalist dreams, China's leaders in Beijing clamped down with an austerity drive to rein in a runaway economy.
Bank lending stopped suddenly under orders from central authorities to recoup tens of billions of dollars in state loans made in a frenzy of unauthorized investment. 
 But China's four-month-old austerity cure may be worse than the disease, especially if it kills the investment momentum that is pouring about $1.5 billion in foreign investment into China each month.
Already, the program has undermined production at some American corporate ventures and dried up bank credits that were financing new factories for other foreign partnerships.
Here in the heart of China's northeastern industrial belt, a $100 million joint venture with the General Motors Corporation and the Jinbei Automotive Company to produce pickup trucks is at a virtual standstill because local governments that would be likely customers for the trucks do not have the money to buy them. And even if they did, Beijing has told Government agencies and state factories to stop buying new vehicles until the end of the year.
The austerity drive's aim was simple: stop the wasteful spending on golf courses when power plants and dams were begging for funds; get control of the inflationary spiral that had broken through 20 percent in urban areas and was still climbing, and, finally, slow China's growth, which was highballing at 13.9 percent in the first half of the year.
But because China's economy still largely runs by central command, the austerity drive froze the flow of money through the banking system.
Financing problems also endanger another $100 million project: Pittsburgh-based PPG Industries' plan to join Japanese and Chinese partners in producing flat glass in nearby Dalian. PPG said its Chinese partners could not get the money they needed.
And the Chinese partners of the big American pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. are also said to be having trouble getting money to finance a venture that began operating earlier this year at Dalian, producing antibiotics and other medical products.
Western bankers here have begun telling European and American corporations to proceed cautiously into China and to gauge how the austerity program, might affect new projects.
The lack of money for Government-owned factories, some of which are straining to meet their payrolls, and the shortage of bank financing for construction became such a crisis that in early October China's economic czar, Deputy Prime Minister Zhu Rongji, flew to Dalian to address the complaints of industrial managers and regional officials.
One result was that the Government decided about a month ago to pump $5.2 billion nationwide into high-priority projects that were going begging for working capital. But this injection may fall well short of the overall demand.
Almost $1 billion of the emergency money was designated for projects here in the northeast, where one foreigner said American joint-venture executives "have been yelling bloody murder" over arbitrary Government decisions to block access to letters of credit and other sources of guaranteed financing.
 
Tight Credit Acknowledged
 Zhou Zhengqing, deputy governor of the People's Bank of China, acknowledged that credit was tight, a situation he said was caused both by excessive construction as well as the controls clamped on by Mr. Zhu.
He said those controls "are not meant to tighten money" and that additional funds were being directed to important projects in the railway, coal, oil, power, communications and building-materials sectors.
For Mr. Zhu, who has day-to-day management control over the economy, engineering a "soft landing" for China's economy is a test of his political skill and China's credibility.
There have been persistent reports in recent weeks that President Jiang Zemin and other members of the Politburo, fearing a crash landing of the economy with Mr. Zhu at the controls, are ready to throw off the strictures of the austerity plan.
In recent days, there have been reports that China's ailing senior leader, Deng Xiaoping, has grumbled that the austerity program is stunting the full-speed growth he insists is the only course.
"It is better to make the pace faster," he was quoted by Wen Wei Po, a pro-Beijing newspaper in Hong Kong, "A slower pace of development is not correct." Then, the Communist Party released one of the old speeches by Mr. Deng to showcase his dictum that slowing growth leads to civil unrest.
 
Fear of Institutional Suffocation
 A number of officials have suggested that the austerity program will be enveloped by a new set of changes aimed at overhauling the banking and taxation systems. This plan was reviewed by the Politburo in the summer and was scheduled for consideration at a Communist Party Central Committee leadership meeting.
A new commercial banking sector could go a long way toward re-establishing credibility for joint-venture companies that are finding out that guaranteed letters of credit are not worth the paper they are written on if the People's Bank of China simply refuses to issue the funds.
"Most of the joint ventures are solving their problems at considerable cost to themselves," said one person knowledgeable about the ventures. "Either they have brought in more money, or they have sent people down to Beijing to complain until they get something done."
A spokesman for PPG Industries, John S. Ruch, said, "Our Chinese partners have not been able to obtain the funding they have been promised" for a $100 million assembly line. PPG hopes that by 1995 it will begin making 600 tons of glass a day for China and for export to Japan.
"At this point," Mr. Ruch said, the plant remains on schedule, but he added that PPG had put its Chinese partners on notice that without a favorable response on the financing by the end of the year, "the project will be affected in the near future." He declined to say whether PPG would pull out.
 
Feeling Pinched
 A Pfizer spokesman in New York, Michael W. Hodin, said the Government's decision to tighten credit had had the effect of "reducing the local funds available for companies to finance their operations."
"This limits expansion opportunities," the statement continued, "and results in an increase in the cost of doing business for both local companies and joint ventures in China."
He did not elaborate on how the tight credit would affect Pfizer's plan to begin operations this year at a 250-employee production line that would make a range of pharmaceuticals.
As for the General Motors joint venture here in Shenyang, analysts say G.M. may be a victim not only of the austerity program, but also of some basic miscalculations about China's auto market. G.M.'s share of the $100 million venture is a $30 million upgrading and expansion of an antiquated assembly line belonging to the Gold Cup state auto maker, which is affiliated with Jinbei, a major commercial vehicle maker.
 
'1920's Technology'
 The plan was to jump into the truck business here by assisting Gold Cup in producing its dowdy trucks temporarily while bringing in kits of G.M.-designed products: a light-duty S-10 pickup truck and the Jimmy and Blazer utility vehicles.
G.M.'s first problem was that in the spring, the aged Gold Cup trucks, which one executive described as "1920's technology," began to lose their market among Chinese customers. At the same time, the S-10 truck was not creating the demand that had been expected. Of the 500 kits assembled since May 1992, the venture sold only 12, one analyst said.
"This could just be a question of suitability to the market," one analyst said. "The S-10 is overengineered for the China market. It is too expensive and it has too many bells and whistles on it." G.M.'s pickup costs about $25,300 in China; competing models sell for 35 percent to 50 percent less.
But the real blow came during the summer, when Mr. Zhu announced his austerity measures and ordered state enterprises to stop buying new vehicles for the rest of this year. Now most of the activity going on at the G.M. assembly line in Shenyang is training and waiting.
 
G.M. in for Long Term
 In Hong Kong, a G.M. spokesman, David Bodkin, said, "We recognize the country had to do something to cool down an overheated economy, and regrettably, we may have to live through it." He would not say how many trucks the venture had sold. "But we did not go to China only to pull out after a year or two," he said. "We view this as a long-term project. We're definitely staying."
Putting the best face on it, Mr. Bodkin pointed out that G.M. business in China was up this year, despite the Shenyang disappointment.
[In Detroit on Monday, G.M. confirmed a report in the trade press that Robert Stramy had been replaced as president of its joint venture with Jinbei. His successor is Stanford Clemens, who took over in October. G.M. said Mr. Stramy left because his job, which was to initiate the venture, had been completed.]
G.M.'s exports to China jumped from 3,600 units in 1992 to an estimated 9,000 units this year. Mr. Bodkin said G.M. still planned to redesign the S-10 truck and hoped to build 50,000 trucks a year by 1998 with Gold Cup.

To Let a Thousand Bull Markets Bloom

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
After watching Adam Smith's two-part series on the Chinese economy, the first impulse is to invest, to get in on the ground floor of China's booming, astonishing economy.
That is not an unreasonable impulse. On Channel 13 tonight and on Nov. 18, Mr. Smith offers a vivid glimpse of China's emerging middle class, now 200 million people and climbing rapidly. Supplying them makes China a golden market, not only for American companies with products to sell but also for Americans with money to invest in the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock markets. 
 Mr. Smith calls it the "China play," and he brings on a Western investment banker in Hong Kong who says, "I foresee a 50-year bull market developing."
We have heard this sort of message, of course. The Chinese economic miracle is a favorite and important media theme; Mr. Smith breaks no new ground. But in his simple, explanatory style, he makes the Chinese marketplace understandable to Americans only casually acquainted with China.
The two half-hour programs are a quick, viewer-friendly course in Chinese economics. They reflect Mr. Smith's surprise, on his first trip to China since 1976, at the buying power and size of the consumer population. He mentions in passing that for all its vigor, China's economy could founder, given that nation's various political and civil-rights problems, and even the possibility of regional conflicts.
He notes that the 200 million middle-class consumers represent less than 20 percent of China's population, clustered mostly in urban coastal areas, while 1 billion Chinese inland still suffer from poverty and hardship. Will this mix erupt in some unforeseen way after the death of Deng Xiaoping, China's 89-year-old leader?
While other journalists raise these downside problems in detail, the message of Mr. Smith's program is that the worst-case scenarios won't happen: China will stay on the high road, regaining the glory it enjoyed through most of history as a rich and powerful nation. So get aboard, America. Or, as J. Stapleton Roy, the American Ambassador, puts it, China is a market that cannot be ignored.
Mr. Roy makes several appearances, becoming a sort of assistant narrator, reinforcing Mr. Smith's message and providing some startling statistics. The Chinese economy, he says, is growing faster than any other nation's, and at the current pace will be the wealthiest economy in the world in 30 years. For every 100 urban households, there are 101 television sets, 77 cameras, more than 55 VCR's -- and good products, not cheap merchandise.
In the rich Guangdong Province near Hong Kong, wages and incomes are rising by 20 percent a year, on average, and bank deposits by 40 percent, Mr. Roy reports. And other experts tell us that by the end of the century, China could have more billionaires than the United States, while already 80 million people in the rising middle class make $10,000 a year.
This rich marketplace has already paid dividends for American companies, Mr. Roy explains, giving Mr. Smith's documentary just the suggestion of a sales pitch for foreign investment. A visit to the A.T. &T. operation, trying to supply China's huge demand for telephones, demonstrates the payoff now and to come for one big investor. And then Mr. Smith and his camera crew move quickly to the next scenes and interviews, never bogging down as they portray, in broad strokes, China's new wealth, its modern cities and rising, Westernized middle class.
Mr. Smith's great skill is in the insights that explain in some simple, memorable way how economics works. His visit to a Beijing family -- parents and young daughter -- does this towards the end of tonight's program. The parents, two of China's new consumers, earn $141 a month, he as a property manager and she as a bookkeeper. But they spend only half this income on necessities in a nation where the state still subsidizes rents, utilities and three daily school meals for their daughter.
That leaves half the income for consumption, a neat explanation of how China can be both a great source of low-wage labor and also middle-class consumption. Can the subsidies and the good times last? No one knows, Mr. Roy says, but Mr. Smith bets that the good times will.

HEADLINE: The Nafta Debate That Wasn't

 BODY:
It wasn't exactly what the Founding Fathers had in mind when they spoke of reasoned political discourse, nor was it what Al Gore and Ross Perot presumably have in mind when they tout the mediating powers of the electronic town hall. Instead, Tuesday's Big Debate over Nafta was a frightful mishmash of rhetorical false starts and logical inconsistencies. It would be nice to say that the evening was redeemed by civility, but it wasn't.
From time to time, Vice President Gore and Mr. Perot returned to the question at hand: Is the North American Free Trade Agreement a good deal? Mr. Gore said it would benefit everyone by eliminating tariffs and boosting exports. Mr. Perot, tapping into widespread anxieties in the labor force, argued that jobs would flee to Mexico as companies relocated in search of cheaper labor. 
 Mr. Gore got the better of the evening. We say this not because this page supports Nafta but because he did a better job of rising above the constant schoolyard bickering and, on matters of substance, stumbled into fewer logical blind alleys.
Early on, Mr. Perot produced a picture of a man hammering together a cardboard shack and said: "Do you know what his dream is? To someday have an outhouse." But he never explained why this man would be worse off under Nafta. When Mr. Gore asked him how he'd improve the lot of the Mexican worker, Mr. Perot replied with the odd argument that the U.S. should impose a "social" tariff that would be phased out as Mexico lifted its wages to U.S. levels. Mr. Gore wasn't quick enough to ask how forcing employers to pay higher wages would help Mexican workers who suffer double-digit unemployment rates.
Mr. Gore also embarked on unproductive digressions, devoting too much time to arguing that Mr. Perot would benefit personally from Nafta's defeat. This seemed part of a White House strategy to paint Mr. Perot as something other than a disinterested citizen who wished only to protect ordinary Americans.
Even here, though, Mr. Gore seems to have scored some useful points. A USA Today/CNN/ Gallup poll reported that 47 percent of adults who saw the show believed Mr. Perot's opposition to Nafta sprang from "personal interests." Respondents also made Mr. Gore a 59-to-32 winner.
The real target of the debate, however, was not the television audience but Congress. Mr. Gore tried his best to appeal to its conscience. Nafta, he said, represented optimism and the future; Mr. Perot represented defeatism and fear. Whether this moved lawmakers -- who seem more worried about their own jobs than any that would be lost to Mexico -- will not be known until the vote on Nov. 17.

Gore Flattens Perot

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Are you going to keep interrupting, or can I finish this column?
In a classic rendition of "Mr. Nice Guy Goes for the Jugular," Vice President Al Gore poked, prodded and needled Ross Perot into revealing himself as a bossy old billionaire bully who blows his cool when confronted in a fair fight. 
 The debate on CNN, which I saw on National Public Radio, wasn't even close. Gallup scored audience reaction as almost 2-to-1 for Gore, and two members of my own focus group showed why: "The old guy was mean to him," said one; her husband said of Perot: "He wants everybody to listen to him, but he don't listen to nobody."
Was this event an elucidation of the issue of free trade versus protectionism? Of course not; the scrap taking place in the arena of Nafta has little to do with foreign economic policy. It is the old grudge fight between the politics of hope against the politics of fear (as the free traders put it) or the cultural elite against the pee-pul (as the protectionists put it).
That's why the Clinton decision to have his Vice President take on Perot was a media masterstroke. Last year, both parties abased themselves polishing the independent's apple. This year, at little political risk (a buildup of the Perot candidacy would cut primarily into any Republican challenger's votes) the President saw how to dramatize a dull issue -- by anointing one volatile villain as spokesman for Nafta's opposition.
Perot stepped eagerly into the trap of Larry King's unstructured debate. His "are you gonna keep interrupting me?" technique works well with journalists, but backfires when used against another politician, especially one who can strike a deferential pose.
The White House strategy was to provoke Perot into blowing his cool, into getting visibly mean and verbally abusive when cornered. Gore's tool in peeling off the veneer of folksiness was an accusation of hypocrisy: since Perot personally profited from his land around a free-trade zone near Mexico, why did the billionaire oppose everybody else getting the same free-trade break?
That threw him on the defensive. In truth, Perot is not in the Nafta opposition for the money he can make; he's only in it for the power he can grab. But the charge of financial hypocrisy rattles him because it undermines his appeal to populist resentment.
When Perot launched his customary attack on lobbyists, Gore landed the counterpunch related to that conflict of interest: "I served in the Congress," said Gore, "and I don't know of any single individual who lobbied the Congress more than you did . . . to get tax breaks for your companies."
"You're lying," Perot sputtered. "You're lying, now." But the fact is that he has lobbied government at all levels all his business life for contracts and special favors, with great success. Vulnerable to this counterpunch, Perot lost control and hurled the word "lying" twice at the Vice President, the cry of the stymied debater.
When Perot expressed his usual scorn at government forecasts, Gore lowered the boom: "When the war against Iraq was about to take place, you told Larry King 'this is a terrible mistake and it'll lead to the death of 40,000 American troops.' " Same with a wild Perot prediction that 100 banks would fail after Election Day. Irrelevant to Nafta? Yes -- but right on target against "the politics of negativism and fear."
Throughout the show, Perot left the impression of a man whining about the interruptions of his interruptions: "I would like to finish a sentence just once before the program's over . . . let's have an unnatural event and try not to interrupt me. . . . Are you going to listen? Work on it. . . ."
Gore's red cape enticed Perot into insulting charges and insolent digs, which Americans recognize as a symptom of blown cool. "Would you even know the truth if you saw it? I don't believe you would. . . . Give me your whole mind. . . ." The effect of this uncontrolled contempt was heightened by the matador's studied, boy-scout respectfulness.
The depressingly sincere Vice President is not the best formal debater around; I thought Dan Quayle edged him last year. But in this performance, Gore proved that a politician armed with courage and civility can beat a bully every time.
Perot's insistent message through his exercise in self-revealing self-destruction was "Let me finish." Let's hope he has.

HEADLINE: U.S. TO GIVE ISRAEL INCENTIVES TO SEEK A BROADER PEACE

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 11

 BODY:
President Clinton is planning to present Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel with a package of military and economic incentives that he hopes will both reinforce the Israeli leader's political standing at home and make him and the Israeli public more willing to deal with Syria.
Among the items Mr. Clinton plans to discuss with Mr. Rabin during their talks on Friday, American and Israeli officials said, is how to help Israel meet an estimated $250 million in costs for roads and military bases required for redeploying Israeli troops from Gaza and Jericho as part of its accord with the Palestine Liberation Organization. One idea is for the Administration to consult with Congress about allowing Israel to use some of the $10 billion in American loan guarantees extended last year for absorbing Russian Jews to pay for redeployment projects in the West Bank and Gaza. 
 Officials said the White House also seeks to address Israel's desire to import more American computer and electronic technology to help it maintain its military edge over the Arab states for another generation. At the moment, some of the most sophisticated American supercomputers and electronics components are banned for export to Israel -- as well as other countries -- because they have both civilian and military applications, particularly for use in ballistic missiles.
 
Assurances on Aid
 President Clinton also plans to offer assurances that his Administration will not cut the current aid level of $3 billion a year, despite a shrinking foreign aid budget, officials said.
Moreover, they said, the Administration wants to discuss Israel's desire to purchase its next generation of American combat aircraft -- the F-15E's -- and how the United States might help Israel defray some of the costs.
There is something very new and something very old about the package. What is old is the laundry list of items that constitute the traditional currency of the United States-Israel security relationship. What is new is that the United States now has little money available to help Israel pay for them.
So, in this era of "no-money diplomacy," the Administration will try to deliver benefits largely by loosening regulations on export controls or loan guarantees, or by offering creative financing proposals, in order to get the Israelis some strategic benefits that might have come from cash or grants in the cold war era.
The politics behind this package, say American officials, is this: Since Mr. Rabin signed the peace accord in September with Yasir Arafat, the P.L.O. chairman, there has been a slight erosion in support for the treaty in Israel, as shown by the recent municipal elections in which Mr. Rabin's Labor Party took a beating from the right-wing Likud in both Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.
Administration officials say they want to do all they can to bolster Mr. Rabin's standing, by showing the Israeli public that the Prime Minister can deliver on their security concerns. At the same time, they want to make the Israeli leader more comfortable with the idea of striking a deal with Syria.
 
Balancing Two Promises
 The question of Syria will hang over all the discussions on Friday between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Rabin at the White House. Mr. Clinton is trying to balance two promises: one to Mr. Rabin not to try to foist on him an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights before Mr. Rabin feels he is ready and able to sell it to the Israeli public, and the other to President Hafez el-Assad of Syria not to let the Israeli-Palestinian deal stand as a separate peace.
As American officials note, the Israeli-Palestinian deal is certainly important for peace. But American strategic interests lie even more importantly with getting a Syrian-Israeli peace accord, since this would eliminate the greatest threat to a major war in the region and help to further isolate Iran, now a Syrian ally.
The Americans fear that if Mr. Assad feels put off by Israel for too long he will invest all of his energy in trying to scuttle the Israeli-Palestinian accord, and the emerging Israeli-Jordanian deal.
But Mr. Rabin has his own domestic balance to worry about, say Israeli officials. One message he will be bringing Mr. Clinton is: don't overload the political circuits in Israel by pushing a Syrian-Israeli deal before President Assad himself demonstrates some real willingness to sign a full treaty. Mr. Rabin, Israeli officials said, will stress to President Clinton his willingness to engage in either secret or public diplomacy with the Syrian President, and that if Mr. Assad were to accept such a meeting it would dramatically recast Mr. Rabin's attitude toward him.
 
Incentives for a Syrian Deal?
 Up to now, Mr. Assad has rejected such secret or public encounters with Israeli leaders. The Syrian leader is still apparently considering whether he is ready to offer Israel the sort of full peace, open trade, and tourism that it would demand in exchange for a withdrawal from the Golan Heights.
The question some Middle East experts are asking is: Will the Clinton package provide what Mr. Rabin needs now to build a solid Israeli constituency for the agreement with the Palestinians and for a future deal with Syria?
Some analysts believe that what goes to the heart of those concerns are matters that are really in the hands of the Palestinians and the Syrians, and that Washington is largely a bystander. Unless the Palestinians can control the radicals in their own community and create their own viable political and economic structures in Gaza and Jericho, American F-15's will not necessarily allay the Israeli public's concern about the peace accord.
Israeli officials said that Mr. Rabin arrived in Washington in a not particularly upbeat mood about the readiness and ability of the Palestinians to take the reins of authority in Gaza and Jericho from the Israeli military. The highly centralized P.L.O. structure under Mr. Arafat has been slow to design solutions to the practical problems of creating a quasi-government in Gaza and Jericho.
While the P.L.O. has been procrastinating, Mr. Rabin has complained, Palestinian opponents to the agreement have been acting with ruthless efficiency, killing Israelis, Arafat loyalists and optimism.

HEADLINE: Maurice Cranston; Briton, 73, Wrote On Political Theory

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON

 BODY:
Maurice Cranston, a British professor who was a leading interpreter of the political philosophers of the 17th and 18th centuries, died last Friday in London. He was 73.
He had a heart attack while recording a television program for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation about the recently published memoirs of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. 
 He was a professor of Political Science at the London School of Economics from 1969 to 1985. His specialty was Rousseau. But he also delved into contemporary thought, as in the study of Jean-Paul Sartre he published in 1962 and a collection called "Western Political Philosophers" he edited two years later.
He wrote two books on freedom and human rights before achieving prominence in 1957 with "John Locke: a Biography." His book about Locke, the 17th-century British doctor-philosopher, won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize in Britain. It was published the same year in the United States by Macmillan.
Professor Cranston was born in London, the son of a theatrical manager, and in his younger years was a freelance writer and film critic. He received his education at the University of London and St. Catherine's College, Oxford.
He lectured at the University of London throughout the 1950's and joined the London School of Economics as a lecturer and reader of political science, becoming a full professor 10 years later.
He lectured, in French, in France and Quebec. In the United States, he was visiting professor at the University of California in 1976 and again from 1986 until last year. He had also served as a visiting professor at Harvard University, Dartmouth College and the University of British Columbia.
He was named a foreign honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1970. He was also a regular contributor of literary features to the BBC.
Professor Cranston is survived by his wife of 35 years, Baroness Maximiliana von und zu Fraunberg. They had two sons, Nicholas and Stephen.

HEADLINE: U.N. Tightens Sanctions Against Libya

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Nov 11

 BODY:
After weeks of haggling and delay, the Security Council finally carried out its threat to tighten sanctions on Libya today. The Council said Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi had defied its order to surrender two Libyans accused in the destruction of a Pan American airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland. The downing of the plane, in 1988, killed 270 people.
Eleven of the Council's 15 members voted for the resolution, which is to freeze Libya's overseas assets, ban some sales of oil equipment and tighten an earlier decision to end commercial air links with Libya. China and the Council's three Islamic members, Djibouti, Pakistan and Morocco, abstained. 
 The new sanctions, which are to take effect Dec. 1, will cause Libya some inconvenience, particularly by cutting off its income from investments it has made around the world. But Libya had ample notice that the restrictions were coming and has been able to hide much of its liquid overseas assets.
Moreover the new measures stop well short of the total ban on oil exports that the Council imposed on Iraq for invading Kuwait. Many families of those who died in the destruction of Pan Am Flight 103 sought a total ban. Libya gets 98 percent of its income from oil, selling mainly to Western Europe.
 
Critics of Resolution
 In addition, French, Belgian, Italian and other foreign oil companies will also be able to maintain the lucrative oil and gas exploration and drilling contracts they have with Libya.
Representatives of the families of the victims of the bombing predicted today that nothing short of a full oil embargo is likely to persuade Colonel Qaddafi to hand over the two suspects.
"This resolution is a step in the right direction but we don't believe it's going to be enough," said Rosemary Wolfe of Washington, who is the head of the Association of the Families of Pan Am 103-Lockerbie and who lost a 20-year-old stepdaughter in the bombing. "Only an oil embargo will get Colonel Qaddafi to comply."
Nevertheless, family representatives who attended the debate broke into applause when the United States representative, Madeleine K. Albright, came to talk with them after the vote.
Clinton Administration officials have made it clear that the United States will press again for a full oil embargo if the new sanctions do not force Libya to hand over the suspects. But Western European countries have resisted a total embargo because it would hurt their economic interests.
In her address today to the Council, Ms. Albright defended the resolution as "balanced and precisely targeted," adding: "To those who say it is not enough, I say this: why did Libya try so hard to stop this resolution if the sting of its new sanctions is so mild?"
But she also told Council members that Washington was willing to go further if these sanctions did not work, noting that the United States has already imposed harsher unilateral measures on Libya. She acknowledged that in formulating the new sanctions, "we have considered and respected the views of those countries whose economic interests at stake might exceed our own."
 
British View Presented
 Sir David Hannay, the British representative, said the new sanctions sent a clear message that "terrorism is not cost-free," adding that Britain favors "gradually ratcheting up" the pressure on Colonel Qaddafi. France's representative, Jean-Bernard Merimee, said Libya's attitude showed that "all it wants to do is play for time."
During an hour-long address to the Council, Libya's representative, Ali Ahmed el-Houderi, questioned its right to require the extradition of Libyans and complained of the Council's "whims, special interests and double standards." Maintaining that polls showed that 61 percent of the British do not believe the Libyans would get a fair trial in Scotland, he repeated Libya's demand that they be tried in a third country.
Speaking on behalf of the Arab League, Sudan's representative, Ahmed Suliman, said additional sanctions would prove counterproductive.
The decision to take new measures against Libya came almost six weeks after the Oct. 1 deadline that the Council had set for Colonel Qaddafi to hand over for trial the two suspects, Abdel Baset Ali Megrahi and Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah.
 
French Investigators
 Libya was also supposed to cooperate with French investigators in the bombing of a French airliner over Niger in 1989 that killed 171 people. And it was supposed to renounce support for international terrorism and agree to compensate victims of the two downings if its agents were found to be responsible.
But the deadline was allowed to slip, initially because Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali wanted more time to mediate. After his efforts got nowhere, Russia for a while threatened to veto new sanctions unless the Council agreed to use frozen Libyan assets to settle an arms debt of $4 billion. In the end, Moscow settled for a paragraph stressing that Libya is still expected to pay its debts.
In addition to freezing Libyan assets, today's resolution bans the sale of oil-refining and pipeline equipment and requires members to reduce the size of Libyan diplomatic missions and close all offices of Jamahiriya Libyan Arab Airlines, the flag carrier.

HEADLINE: A Disneyland of History Next to the Real Thing

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HAYMARKET, Va., Nov. 11

 BODY:
To the shock and utter exuberance of many in this thoroughly rural village 35 miles from the White House, the Walt Disney Company unwrapped plans today for a new amusement park that would relive the grand sweep of American history. Only better, of course.
On 3,000 verdant acres abutting a busy Interstate highway, Disney will split the American story into nine playlands which, planners declared, will let visitors participate in the nation's creation but without getting shot, or even dirty. 
 When and if the park opens in 1998, it will occupy only about 100 acres of the site. The rest, officials said today, will be held as open space or marked for later development with hotels, shops, houses or apartments and other ventures. The company declined to say how much all this would cost, except that the total would run into the "hundreds of millions."
Virginia and Prince William County, the park's locale, will also be asked to do their part, building a new highway interchange and other improvements. In return, Disney officials estimated that the attraction would pump about $1.5 billion in taxes into state and local treasuries over the next three decades.
 
Losses at Euro Disney
 Today's announcement came as Disney disclosed that it had lost $900 million in the first full year of operation of its Euro Disney theme park outside Paris, a figure so large that the company's executives committed themselves to eating future losses for only "a limited period" while they sought refinancing of the venture.
Disney officials here shrugged that off. They said that Euro Disney was still the Continent's biggest tourist attraction and that the losses stemmed mostly from Europe's recession. The company's other theme parks, in California, Florida and Tokyo, are still enormously profitable, they said.
As for the park being planned here, there has never been anything like it in Mickey Mouse's empire or anywhere else -- unless, of course, one counts American history itself, which saturates the piney hills and rolling pastures surrounding the park site.
Tourists not fulfilled by the Manassas National Battlefield Park, the solemn site of two of the Civil War's most poignant battles, could drive five miles up the road to Disney's America for what its designers call the Civil War "experience."
And if a glimpse of Bill Clinton's morning jog whetted their appetite, they could drive 40 minutes to a Disney building crammed with talking, moving Presidents, dead and alive.
 
Making History 'Real'
 "The goal here is to make this real," said Peter Rummel, who heads the Disney Design and Development unit that designed the park.
Disney's America will feature arecreated Indian village with a Lewis and Clark whitewater ride, and a Crossroads USA town, a recreation of a bustling town of the mid-1800's that sells 1990's souvenirs. It will sport a Civil War scene with realistic floating ironclads, a replica fort, and veritable slaves and soldiers. It will include the factory town Enterprise, in which roller-coaster riders will careen under smoky vats of ersatz molten steel, just as in the era of the steel barons.
It will boast cheek-pinching real "audioanimatronic" Presidents -- computer-driven mannequins that will spout historic speeches and debate one another. And it will have a genuine-looking Army airfield where computer animation will let 10-year-olds fly World War II bomb runs and parachute behind enemy lines.
Some preservationists and lifelong residents are expected to oppose Disney's America, with the traffic, fast-food restaurants and geegaw shops sure to follow if the park is established. But Prince William County is in the economic horse latitudes after two go-go decades, and the park's 3,000 jobs seemed as thrilling to local residents as the prospect of something new to do.
 
Good Things Predicted
 "I think it'll do the area a world of good," said John Evans, who moved to America 18 years ago as a British diplomat and now runs an antique shop here with his wife. "It's not a rich town. There are a lot of people out of jobs."
Sarah M. Turner, the head of the Haymarket Historical Commission and chief chronicler of events in this town of 500 people, said that as far as she was concerned Disney could not come soon enough.
"I think it will be fine," she said. "I think almost anything out here would be an improvement, because it's so dull."
Manassas National Battlefield, where 4,200 Union and Confederate soldiers died in July 1861 and August 1862 -- both Confederate victories -- is a local shrine. But "there's not much exciting there for a child," Mrs. Turner said.
True again. Over at the national park, there is a brief movie and booklets about the Civil War, and there is a walking tour. But there is no Circle Vision 360, which Disney's designers said would transport visitors into simulated combat.
 
Battlefield Visitors
 About 130,000 people a year visit the battlefield. Disney is reported to anticipate that many tourists in about four days of business.
In fact, Faith Swettle, of nearby Warrenton, had planned to take her four children to today's Disney announcement until, as often happens with children, they all got out late. So she took them to the Manassas battlefield, with its somber hills and statues and authentic stone houses, instead.
"You come here, it's quiet, very moving," she said. "You can almost feel what they went through."
But as she read the Disney brochure, she concluded that the park would be a great addition. "Good for the economy," she said. "I think it'll be neat."
The visitor's log at the Manassas battlefield, where tourists leave parting comments, echoed that.
"Cool place. Neat."
"Good show."
"Sell T-shirts."
"Very moving."
Wrote Keli Wright, of Oakton, Va., "Get a snack bar, or at least a vending machine."
Replied Warren W. Walls, of St. Louis, "Leave it as it is."

HEADLINE: U.S. and China Try to End Bar to High-Tech Trade

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 11

 BODY:
The United States and China are negotiating to eliminate American trade sanctions on high-technology exports to China, senior Administration officials said today.
But the Administration has so far failed to persuade China to formally agree to an international accord controlling the export of missile technology. And President Clinton's senior national security advisers agreed at a White House meeting on Wednesday to keep the sanctions in place unless China agrees.
 
Talks Next Week
 The Administration had hoped to strike a deal with China on lifting the sanctions before Mr. Clinton meets China's President, Jiang Zemin, in Seattle on Nov. 19, the first top-level meeting since before the June 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre in Beijing. Unless Mr. Clinton overrules his advisers, he will not be able to announce the end of sanctions. 
 "Our conditions for waiving the sanctions haven't changed," a senior Administration official said. "We have been urging the Chinese to talk about those conditions, but so far they've refused."
The Administration imposed sanctions on an estimated $1 billion in high-technology trade with China in August, as required under law, after intelligence agencies reported that China had shipped technology and components for M-11 missiles to Pakistan in violation of the Missile Technology Control Regime. The sanctions affect the planned launches of seven commercial satellites on Chinese rockets.
But as part of the Administration's larger strategy to win over China rather than isolate it, the White House is looking for a legal way to ease the sanctions.
In an effort to persuade the Chinese to begin talks on the sanctions, and in a major concession to United States business, the White House is pressing for a broad legal interpretation of the law requiring sanctions so some sales can proceed. The goal is to have Mr. Clinton accept the broad interpretation so that he can approve the export of one or two of the satellites by the time he goes to Seattle, senior Administration officials said.
White House lawyers argue that satellites that do not include components on the State Department's munitions list are not covered by the sanctions law and should be allowed for export.
"The National Security Council genuinely believes that the legal arguments are not clear cut and that there is some discretion on how to apply the law," an Administration expert said. "It's in part a matter of good business and in part that Seattle is coming up."
But it is far from certain whether satellites manufactured by Hughes Aircraft and Martin Marietta, the companies whose exports are pending, will be allowed to ship them.
Mr. Clinton intends to use next week's meetings with East Asian heads of state to point to his foreign policy successes, particularly efforts to increase trade with Asia. In his meeting with Mr. Jiang, the President will cite a series of high-level exchanges in the last several weeks between the United States and China, officials said.
 
Contact With Chinese Army
 As a result of one such visit, the Administation recently announced the resumption of long-suspended contacts between the Pentagon and the Chinese Army. The next high-level visit will be a trip to Beijing this winter by Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen.
Senior Administration officials added that Mr. Clinton would bring a negative message to Seattle as well: that China must make urgent progress on human rights, trade and non-proliferation of nuclear arms.
Senior officials said he would not be able to escape the conclusion voiced by Secretary of State Warren Christopher and other senior officials: that the relationship with Beijing has deteriorated in recent months and that unless there is significant improvement, particularly in China's human rights record, Washington will be unable to renew trade benefits for China when they come up for review in June.
These benefits, which allow China to export goods to the United States under the same low tariffs that apply to most other countries, form the foundation of the two nations' economic links.
There is other worrisome behavior as well. China experts in the Administration have concluded that China's underground nuclear test in early October was not a gesture of defiance aimed at the United States but an important military decision to improve strategic nuclear forces.
And Administration officials are convinced that American intelligence reports indicating that China intended to ship ingredients for chemical weapons to Iran were accurate, despite the fact that an inspection of a merchant ship turned up no evidence.

HEADLINE: Even Brazil Is Shocked: State Is One Family's Fief

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MACEIO, Brazil

 BODY:
With her gold earrings glinting and high heels sinking in the mud, Denilma Bulhoes roams her domain, bringing what she calls a message of hope to the peasants and shantytown dwellers in Brazil's impoverished northeast corner.
Underscoring the mixed message, her husband, Geraldo, the Governor of Alagoas State, appears before photographers in dark glasses and releases a white dove. 
 With a few superficially modern touches, the Bulhoes family offers a portrait of a Latin American institution that is certain to endure into the 21st century: the provincial oligarchy.
From Mexico to Argentina, powerful political clans still hold sway in much of rural Latin America. In Brazil they flourish particularly in the most disadvantaged states, in the Amazon and the Northeast, where wealthy families feud among themselves for control of city hall or the state governor's palace.
 
Cholera and Leprosy
 In Alagoas, where the Bulhoes family has presided over the state machinery since 1991, the people suffer from the highest infant mortality rate in the region, its lowest child vaccination rate, its lowest rate of prenatal care and one of its lowest rates of schooling -- 1.8 years per adult.
In this seaside capital of 600,000, slum dwellers are plagued by cholera and leprosy; by contrast, the local elite looks forward to the day in January when cellular telephone service will be inaugurated.
The state Governor's wife chartered an executive jet three times this year to fly to Sao Paulo and back, with the state treasury picking up the $24,000 bill for each trip. At the same time, the state's public schools were closed for seven months because teachers were protesting salaries of $80 a month. Taking a hard line with the teachers was the state Secretary of Education, Isnaldo Bulhoes, a brother of the Governor.
Partial to French suits and Italian shoes, Mrs. Bulhoes shops for clothes in Miami, Paris and New York. Swinging through Alagoas, she says, "Poor people have just the same right to see me pretty as people in society."
An untiring campaigner who hopscotches across the region in her helicopter and claims to be more popular than her husband, Mrs. Bulhoes plans to run in 1995 for the Mayor's seat here in Maceio.
 
High Ratings in the Polls
 "In this panorama of absolute poverty, where people are dying of hunger, if you arrive out of the blue with some food, people think you are God," said Pedro Collor, a local newspaper owner, trying to explain the political couple's consistently high ratings in polls conducted in the state of 2.5 million.
A central tenet of a Latin American political oligarchy is a blurring of lines between public and private.
In Brazil's northeastern states, political families pass power from father to son: the Magalhaes in Bahia, the Maias in Rio Grande do Norte, the Arcoverdes in Piaui, and the Tavoras, the Bezerras and the Cals in Ceara.
In Alagoas, the blurring of public and private developed into a virtual art form with the inauguration in 1991 of Geraldo Bulhoes, a three-term Congressman who had risen from rural roots.
At the Governor's palace, Enaldo Bulhoes, a brother of the Governor and a staff member, helps route state cars to a garage partly owned by one of the Governor's sons, Geraldo Henrique, for servicing. The state's printing needs are met by a shop owned by another son, Gustavo, and state travel arrangements are handled by an agency owned by the Governor's daughter, Ana.
 
No Fear of Inquiries
 But the family has no fear of inquiries by the state Attorney General; the post is occupied by Heraldo Bulhoes, another brother of the Governor.
"Corruption has become institutionalized in Alagoas," said Luiz Barbosa Carnauba, an independent state prosecutor who is conducting criminal investigations of the extended family. Mr. Carnauba says he has received death threats.
The Governor's eldest son, Geraldo Henrique, is under investigation on charges that he takes kickbacks for reducing tax obligations and in awarding contracts for road repair and school contruction.
After winning election in 1990, Mr. Bulhoes built the state-controlled military police into a major political base. In two years, the police payroll doubled, from 8,000 to 16,000, including a newly formed "Denilma Bulhoes Battalion" of women who served as officers.
 
Police Notorious for Violence
 Statistics show that crime actually increased, partly as a result of a free rein given to police officers. The Bulhoes rehired about 120 policemen who had been dismissed for corruption or for excessive violence. Whenever police brutality cases came to trial, military police units surrounded the courthouse, forcing witnesses to walk through a corridor of armed and hostile men.
Police violence became so notorious here that a Brazilian congressional investigation concluded in June that the military police were involved in 80 percent of the 600 murders committed in Alagoas during the first two years of the Bulhoes government.
Sometimes violence erupts within the Bulhoes clan itself.
Last June, when Geraldo Henrique asked his younger brother Gustavo to account for the print shop's expenses, Gustavo stormed out of the palace here and sprayed his brother's car with automatic rifle fire before guards disarmed him. Geraldo Henrique met his brother in the parking lot, pulled out a pistol, and aimed it at his brother's head. Then he lowered the pistol and shot his brother in the left foot.
 
President Intervenes
 Last spring there was a national outcry when dissident police officers charged that the police commander, a protege of the family, was skimming $400,000 a month in illegal deductions from the police payroll. One of the dissident officers, a police colonel, was detained in May in a police hospital, where police doctors were reported to have injected him with tranquilizers.
The scandal grew so great that Brazil's President, Itamar Franco, intervened in July by appointing an army colonel as the police commander for Alagoas.
But in a state where 27 families own 60 percent of the fertile land, the Bulhoes still seem to enjoy a kind of impunity.
Blood feuds are common among the handful of political clans that jockey for power in each of Brazil's 10 northeastern states.
On Nov. 5 in Paraiba, the state Governor recently walked into a restaurant and shot his predecessor twice, leaving him critically wounded.
After spending a few hours in jail, the Governor was released on the ground that he did not have a criminal record. Angry over corruption accusations made by his predecessor, the Governor announced that he would argue in court that he was defending his honor.
Here in Alagoas, the string of abuses began in February, when the youngest of the couple's four children, Guilherme, shot his girlfriend in the hand in a motel. In May, Gustavo Bulhoes urinated in front of a beachfront tourist bar, taunting the police to try to arrest a son of the Governor. Two policemen detained him, and they were later dismissed from the force.
Then in August, Gustavo ran over an 17-year-old girl waiting at a bus stop here. After pausing to pull the critically injured girl off his car hood, he raced off without bothering to call an ambulance on his police radio. But in his haste to escape the accident scene, he plowed into three other cars.
The Bulhoes family managed to keep Gustavo's name out police reports, but not out of the newspapers.
The Governor declined to be interviewed here. Mrs. Bulhoes was out of town, on a two-week shopping trip in New York.
 
A 'Shocking Picture'
 Even in Brazil, where excesses of the wealthy are often excused, the Bulhoes oligarchy is seen as an embarrassment, especially in the country's developed south. It is not lost on the public that Mr. Bulhoes's predecessor as Governor was Fernando Collor de Mello, an Alagoas native who resigned last year as Brazil's President after lawmakers impeached him on charges of benefiting from a multimillion-dollar influence-peddling ring.
"This is the shocking picture of the type of regional oligarchy that unfortunately has not yet disappeared from our political scene," a recent editorial in the Rio newspaper Globo said of the Bulhoes family.
In another Rio newspaper, Jornal do Brasil, a journalist named Rosemarie Muraro wrote scathingly of Mrs. Bulhoes, "Evita Peron was only possible when Argentina was a big Alagoas."

HEADLINE: Mindful of Trade Fight, Clinton Warns of Isolationism

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 11

 BODY:
President Clinton used the 75th anniversary today of the armistice ending World War I to warn against a return to the economic isolationism that he said once again poses a threat to American security.
Mr. Clinton referred only obliquely to the North American Free Trade Agreement in his Veterans Day remarks. But his words added gravity to an Administration attempt to elevate its fight for passage of the accord to one seen as representing a momentous choice in the nation's history. 
 "Once again, history is about to take the measure of our wisdom," Mr. Clinton declared in an address to hundreds of veterans in an amphitheater adjoining the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National Cemetery. He said Americans would choose "whether we will swell the global tide of freedom by promoting democracy and open world markets or neglect the duty of our leadership, and in the process and in the withdrawal diminish hope and prosperity not only for our own people, but for billions of others throughout the world."
Mr. Clinton, who was born 28 years after the First World War ended, offered the predominantly older veterans a history-book style reprisal of an American descent after 1918 into isolation, protectionism and more war. As Vice President Al Gore did on Tuesday night in his televised debate with Ross Perot, he held up the high tariffs of the 1930's as the dangerous alternative to the controversial slashing of tariffs with Mexico and Canada that he has proposed.
 
'Siren Song of Protectionism'
 "We neglected during a careless peace what had been so dearly won in a relentless war," the President said. "We turned our backs on the rest of the world. We ignored new signs of danger. We let our troops and arms fall out of readiness. We neglected opportunities for collective security in our own national interests. We succumbed to the siren song of protectionism and erected walls against peaceful commerce with other nations. Soon, we had a Great Depression and soon that depression led to aggression and then to another world war, one that would claim a half-million American lives."
He added, "Let us today resolve we will not shrink from the responsibilities necessary to keep our nation secure and our people prosperous."
Mr. Clinton's appearance was not marked by the kind of hostility he has sometimes encountered from military groups disdainful of his decision to evade military service during the Vietnam War. But on his first Veterans Day since taking office, Mr. Clinton went out of his way to praise Army Rangers for their valor in the Oct. 3 battle in Somalia. They suffered heavy casualties in the incident, which forced a reappraisal of American policy there.
By inviting 17 of the Rangers and Delta Force soldiers involved in that firefight to visit him in the Oval Office and join him at the ceremony, aides said, Mr. Clinton hoped to send a message that their conduct had been heroic and not the fiasco that some published accounts have described.
 
Mending Military's Image
 In a larger sense, the gesture served as a first step by the President to repair the damage to the military's image from the Somalia mission, which has contributed to the isolationist impulses he was warning against.
"We owe it to them and to their colleagues to insure that our forces remain the best trained, the best equipped, the best prepared in the world," Mr. Clinton said. He said the aftermath to victory in the cold war was testing once again "whether we will preserve freedom's gains and learn freedom's lessons."
The President arrived hatless and coatless at the cemetery on a bright but chilly autumn day, and he moved with a touch of awkwardness as he laid a wreath at the unknown soldiers' tomb and was honored with a 21-gun salute. Military leaders and veterans of battlefields from France to Mogadishu greeted him with polite applause.
In a week in which the House of Representatives only grudgingly approved his request to keep American troops in Somalia until March 31, Mr. Clinton seemed determined to drive home his message that the United States must remain engaged with the rest of the world. He began the day by congratulating the American Legion for its support of the trade agreement, and he met privately with the Rangers so that he could recount "the real story" of their ordeal.
Although 18 Americans died and more than 70 were wounded in that fight, Mr. Clinton noted that most of the casualties were suffered because the elite unit chose to stay behind to protect the body of a fallen comrade. He said the Rangers exacted a "terrible toll" on their adversaries. "I want you to let them know that they did their mission well and that we are proud of them," he said.
Later in the day, the President traveled to Martinsburg, W.Va., where he toured a Veterans Administration hospital, awarded medals to four World War I veterans and made a brief pitch for the universal health coverage program that he has proposed.
"I'm very proud of the fact that the health care reform plan proposed by our Administration is the only one that embraces the V.A. as a real resource for high quality, affordable health care for our people," he said.

HEADLINE: Dr. Nicholas A. Rango, 49, Dies; Built New York's AIDS Program

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
Dr. Nicholas A. Rango, who built New York State's AIDS Institute into the nation's largest state AIDS program while struggling with the illness himself, died on Wednesday at home. He was 49 and lived in Manhattan.
The cause was AIDS, the State Health Department said. 
 Dr. Rango publicly acknowledged his illness and his homosexuality. He ran the agency from his sickbed during medical relapses. In June he said, "When you're aware the clock is ticking, it focuses your attention."
Through his work in New York, he exerted national influence on AIDS issues. He also organized his counterparts from other states into a coalition to lobby for Federal money and policy changes.
 
Recruited in 1987
 Dr. Rango was recruited to his post as director of the AIDS Institute in 1987 as the epidemic worsened in New York, which has the most AIDS cases in the country. His mission was to plan treatment and prevention and to get services delivered.
During his tenure, the AIDS Institute quadrupled its budget to $120 million and expanded into a wide array of programs.
Dr. Rango broadened services to people other than gay men who were increasingly afflicted by AIDS, including heterosexuals, women and babies. New programs were begun for teen-agers, minorities, prisoners and addicts.
Advocates for AIDS programs, even while complaining about the state's shortcomings, considered him a friend behind the scenes. Once, when the group Act Up disrupted a State Public Health Council meeting by blowing deafening horns, Dr. Rango confided to a bystander that he was glad the protesters kept the pressure on.
"We are moving too slow," he said in 1989, repeating a frequent theme. "We have done a lot, but we have not done enough." Sometimes acerbic, he said at a 1990 seminar on lobbying: "On the issue of AIDS, the New York Congressional delegation is somewhere between stage three and four of a coma."
 
The First Long-Range Plan
 Dr. Rango assembled the state's first long-range plan on AIDS. It called for action by 18 agencies, including those dealing with human rights, the courts, schools, mental health, youths, parolees, addicts and welfare recipients.
He initiated AIDS medical care standards, a wider definition of AIDS entitling more patients to receive care, special nursing homes and residences, higher reimbursements to encourage doctors and clinics to treat AIDS patients, housing aid, prison health programs, home care, tuberculosis programs, care for the uninsured, research to prevent accidental exposures like needle sticks and special training for doctors and nurses.
Dr. Rango advocated giving clean needles to drug users to curb infection, a measure resisted by many state and local officials. He also expanded preventive education, voluntary testing, confidentiality protection, subsidized medications for 7,300 patients and a network of AIDS treatment centers in 23 hospitals across the state.
Nationally, he led the opposition to mandatory testing of health care workers and to the barring of infected people from doing invasive medical procedures.
In New York he worked with State Health Commissioners David Axelrod and Mark Chassin and with the State AIDS Advisory Council and its chairman, David Rogers. With Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, they forged the administration's AIDS programs and sought support from the Legislature.
Getting money for the agency was a constant struggle, and Dr. Rango was quick to defend its semi-independent status within the Health Department.
He did not win every battle. He failed in an attempt to require Roman Catholic-run AIDS nursing homes to give preventive education on safe sex and the use of condoms. When the recession hit, AIDS funds and staffing did not rise so quickly as the epidemic, which by June 30 reached 61,082 cases with 42,567 deaths.
Trained in gerontology and sociology, Dr. Rango was the director of the Village Nursing Home in Manhattan before joining the AIDS agency. In AIDS work he faced many of the same terminal-care issues but in much younger patients, he said.
 
An Ohio Native
 Dr. Rango was born in Youngstown, Ohio. He graduated from St. Louis University in Missouri and earned his medical degree at Northwestern University. At Cook County Hospital in Chicago, he was president of the Residents and Interns Association, a union with more than 500 members.
He earned a doctorate in sociology at Columbia and for nine years taught health at Barnard College, where he developed a health policy and medical ethics program for premedical students.
Dr. Rango won awards for his work, published research in medical journals and assisted on the federally sponsored National Hospice Study and the Hasting Center's project on Termination of Treatment and Care of the Dying.
His survivors include his mother, Doris, of Manhattan; a brother, Arthur, of Manhattan, and a sister, Ann Ursula Watkins of Warren, Ohio.
A Mass will be held at 12:45 P.M. on Wednesday at the Church of St. Francis Xavier at 30 West 16th Street in Manhattan.

HEADLINE: The High Price of Protectionism

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
Ross Perot and other critics of the North American Free Trade Agreement have hammered away at how many American jobs will be lost if the United States lets down barriers to Mexican imports.
What has gotten much less attention is the cost of keeping those barriers: how much Americans pay in higher prices when tariffs and other barriers are used to protect jobs, and how effective such protection is in shielding workers from job losses. 
 Almost all economists agree that the price of protecting jobs with trade barriers is high. First, there is the cost of the tariffs, themselves, which amount to billions of dollars a year. Then there are other less visible costs as well, including greater inefficiency and bigger profits for foreign and domestic producers, which are harder to measure, but also very large.
 Economists have pondered the price of protection since Adam Smith's 1776 treatise, "The Wealth of Nations," which detailed the costs of mercantilism. And economists of nearly every political stripe since then, from conservatives like Milton Friedman to liberals like Paul Samuelson, have dismissed protection as a job-saving strategy.
Dozens of studies in recent years have estimated the costs, reaching remarkably similar conclusions. One such study that is receiving attention now, in the middle of the debate over the North American pact, is work by Gary Hufbauer and Kim Elliott, two pro-Nafta trade experts at the Institute for International Economics.
They estimate that Americans effectively spend about $32 billion more each year on purchases of goods and services than they would if there were no barriers to goods entering this country. Their figures, drawn from surveys of 21 industries with sales of $1 billion or more that the United States protects most heavily, suggests that the price of protection amounts to $170,000 a year per job saved. The authors note that that is many times the pay in the jobs being protected -- as well as many times what it would cost to send a worker back to school to learn a new trade.
 The estimates by the two economists are not hard and fast numbers, and depend on assumptions about how consumers and companies would react to changes in import prices if existing tariffs were abolished overnight.
Some advocates of protection for key industries argue that the calculations include only the costs, but not the benefits, of protection. Jeff Faux, president of the Economic Policy Institute, a union-backed research organization, is one who calls the Hufbauer-Elliott figures "way overblown."
A non-economist who has provided some of the intellectual fodder for Nafta foes, Mr. Faux argues the researchers ignored the savings from avoiding worker dislocation, the added investment that protected companies may undertake and the likelihood that producers, not consumers, would capture gains from lower tariffs.
But many trade experts consider the calculations conservative. And economists who have seen the work say they find the methodology reasonable.
"Most economists would agree with the estimates, both with the techniques and the actual numbers," said Dominick Salvatore, an international economist at Fordham University and editor of "Protectionism and World Welfare" who supports freer trade with Mexico and other nations.
Furthermore, Mr. Hufbauer says that trimming the estimates would not puncture the point that protection is a very costly strategy for retaining low-wage manufacturing jobs.
"We not going to defend these numbers to the last digit," Mr. Hufbauer said. "But even if we're off by a factor of 10, the policy is bonkers.
"If protection were a boon to low-skilled workers, how is it that we have extremely bad working conditions and low pay in sugar plantations in Florida and Louisiana? Basically, if protection helps anybody, it's the owners. It doesn't trickle down."
 
 
Smoot-Hawley Days
 Only about 5 percent of United States manufacturing -- about 1 in 10 factory workers -- gets significant protection from imports, and many of the protective tariffs date back to the Smoot-Hawley days of 1930. Smoot-Hawley tariffs still exist on products ranging from luggage to shoes, and range from 6.5 percent to 21 percent. The North American trade pact, if adopted, would squeeze most tariffs on Mexican imports to zero by 2000.
What is equally surprising is that although these 21 protected industries employ nearly two million workers, the two trade experts calculate that tariffs and quotas effectively shield only about 200,000 workers. That would amount to $160,000 per job being saved, several times as much as the average worker in those industries takes home in pay.
The luggage-making industry shows how much tariffs can cost consumers. It is a small industry, with relatively high tariffs, but one in which relatively few jobs are thought to have been saved. An industry that turns out about $1 billion in luggage annually and employs about 7,500 workers -- the number has been shrinking by about 2 percent a year -- it has been helped by tariffs that raise the price of virtually every piece of luggage imported from other countries. Consumers who buy a suitcase made in China or the Dominican Republic, for example, pay a 16.5 percent duty on it, or a total of $169 million a year.
 
 
Damping Competition
 But the two economists say that while those costs are sizable, they do not fully capture the price Americans pay for such protection. By making imports less competitive with American-made suitcases, tariffs let domestic manufacturers charge more than they might otherwise because they do not need to compete with the very low prices on imports. And by damping competition even a little, tariffs remove an incentive for the domestic industry to be as efficient as it could be.
Mr. Hufbauer and Ms. Elliott conclude that when these factors are added up, American consumers pay $211 million more every year for luggage than they would otherwise have to, to save about 200 jobs. The effective cost per domestic job saved, the two economists calculate, amounts to almost $1 million a year.
Nor is the luggage industry an isolated example. The two economists conducted similar calculations for other large, heavily protected industries -- from clothing to ceramic tiles to sugar -- and concluded that protection for these industries carried similar heavy costs.
Despite the high cost, the protection is not very effective in saving jobs. According to Mr. Hufbauer and Ms. Elliott, employment in most protected industries is shrinking anyway, just as it is in many other manufacturing industries that are eliminating lower-skilled jobs to become more efficient.
 
 
Losing a Job to Another Region
 What is more, the workers who are supposed to be shielded from dislocation often do not avoid it. High apparel and textile barriers never kept New England textile mills and garment factories from shutting down, and for a worker, or a region, losing a job to Florida can be just as devastating as losing it to the Far East.
Take the experience of Frank de Sousa, a 25-year employee of an American Tourister plant in Warren, R.I., who clocked in for the last time several weeks ago. After years of downsizing, consolidations and pay concessions, during which three plants were closed, American Tourister this year moved its last operations to Jacksonville, Fla., leaving behind 350 Rhode Island workers, many of them Portuguese immigrants who speak little English and have few job options.
"I worked in the plant for almost 25 years," Mr. de Sousa said. "Nobody got a pension. I'll pick up part-time jobs sometime, wait until summertime, cut some grass or something like that."
Luggage is the most extreme case the researchers studied, and economically, not the most important. But, according to Mr. Hufbauer's and Ms. Elliott's estimates, the hidden tax on consumers for each job saved by high tariffs -- or in some cases quotas -- on 21 products ranging from suitcases to sugar to sweaters, exceeds $150,000 per job.
 
 
Worker Retraining Programs
 Even after taking into account that the Government makes money by collecting the tariffs and American companies earn extra profits, the net cost to the nation is still $54,000 per job -- several times what workers in the protected industries earn.
That kind of arithmetic makes may many economic experts, including Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich, suggest that substituting worker retraining programs -- at a cost of no more than $15,000 a year per worker -- for tariffs would be a real bargain for the country.
Still, there is no rush in this direction. "First of all, in an age of economic anxiety, a good job in danger of being lost is more potent than a better job not yet visible," Secretary Reich said, calling it "a bird in the hand phenomenon."

HEADLINE: Cautious Optimism as Fall Art Auctions End

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
As the two most important weeks of the fall art auctions in New York ended on Wednesday night, it wasn't high prices but a new infusion of energy that stunned the art world. Not since the heady years of the 1980's had there been so much enthusiasm and so many determined bidders. But these buyers weren't going crazy and paying ridiculously high prices. Indeed, the last two weeks have been less about conspicuous consumption and more about a sense of renewed confidence.
"It's fashionable to buy art again," said Diana D. Brooks, who heads Sotheby's auctions worldwide. "We've turned an important corner this fall. After a difficult few years when people were scared away, they now feel good about buying art again." She cited lower interest rates and strength on Wall Street as having helped make the difference. 
 Christopher Burge, the president of Christie's in New York, said: "There's new money out there, and it's pretty visible. New buyers were from all the major industries. Everyone from entertainers to financial advisers is coming into the market."
 
Back to Middle Ground
 Both Sotheby's and Christie's worked hard this season to keep estimates low, helping to fuel sales. Savvy collectors recognized that this season's sales offered an opportunity to buy at realistic prices. The lure of a bargain, after all, is irresistible.
Unlike last season, when "quality sells" was the tired mantra of the auction experts, this fall art of all levels and quality sold, including less expensive works the experts call the middle market, which often went unsold last season.
Still, the dollar totals from the last two weeks of sales were not impressive. Christie's sales of Impressionist and modern art brought in $64.1 million and Sotheby's brought $93.4 million, including the Stanley J. Seeger collection of Picassos. Contemporary art, as always, fetched far less. Christie's contemporary-art sales totaled $22.6 million; Sotheby's totaled $21.7 million. (Final prices reflect the buyer's commission, which was 10 percent before 1993 and is now 15 percent on the first $50,000 and 10 percent on the rest. The estimates do not include commissions.)
 
Picasso's Night
 The auction that was by far the biggest risk and in the end turned out to be the biggest success was Sotheby's sale of 88 Picassos from the Seeger collection on Nov. 4. The works spanned the artist's entire career, from 1899 to 1972, and every medium.
Every work sold, with many bringing double their estimates. While there were no blockbusters, there were paintings that carried estimates of several million dollars and a host of drawings offered for as little as $8,000 each.
Mr. Seeger, a reclusive American who lives in Switzerland, began buying Picasso's work in 1980, acquiring almost all of his collection at auctions in London and New York. The sale became a telling barometer of the art market's last 13 years. Works for which Mr. Seeger paid high prices in the 1980's were offered with significantly lower estimates, while those he bought longer ago carried price tags that reflected their significant inflation.
The star work, "Women and Children at the Seashore" (1932), was sold to an unidentified American collector for $4.4 million, well above Sotheby's estimate of $2.5 million to $3.5 million. Mr. Seeger had bought the painting at a sale at Christie's in New York in 1983 for $990,000. Another important painting, "Glass, Bouquet, Guitar, Bottle" (1919) sold for $2.3 million, just under Sotheby's estimate of $2.5 million to $3.5 million.
But Mr. Seeger didn't always sell at a profit. "Setting Sun," a painting from 1956, sold for only $398,500, below Sotheby's $500,000 to $700,000 estimate. Mr. Seeger bought it at Christie's in London in 1989 for $1.8 million.
Drawings, which have recently become particularly popular, often soared way beyond expectations. "Portrait of Angel Fernandez de Soto" (1899-90) brought a surprising $530,500, more than five times its estimate of $80,000 to $100,000. Mr. Seeger had bought it at Christie's in London in 1988 for $154,500. After the sale, David Nash, the director of Sotheby's department of Impressionist and modern art, noted that many bidders were people he never thought would be interested in Picasso.
 
Hits and a Big Miss
 New buyers were active at the sales of Impressionist and modern art, too. Both sales had similar results, with some works bringing prices that far exceeded their estimates. At Sotheby's, the star work was a Matisse cutout, "The Wine Press" (1951), which sold for $13.7 million, nicely above Sotheby's estimate of $10 million. But Christie's top painting, Renoir's "Motherhood or a Woman Nursing Her Son" (1886), failed to sell. It was expected to bring $8 million, but bidding never rose above $4.8 million. No one seemed surprised, however, since the work had been at auction fairly recently; it had previously sold for $8 million at Sotheby's in New York in 1988. But just as the Renoir fell flat, Degas's "Dancers Taking a Bow (The Ballerinas)," from 1885, sold for $7 million. The pastel, which showed dancers taking a curtain call, doubled its low estimate of $3.5 million.
Many works at the contemporary sales also fetched far more than their estimates, but people who attended all the sales of the last two weeks couldn't help noticing the difference between the two areas. "Two different things happened in the two different markets," Mr. Burge said. "In the Impressionist and modern field, the turnaround came 18 months ago, and what we saw last week was a continued steadying." The contemporary-art market, on the other hand, has been far weaker for the last three years, and this week it made a big leap forward.
Buyers of contemporary art follow trends more closely and trade more furiously. This has traditionally been a more volatile segment of the market. Contemporary art had the greatest inflation in the boom years, the most dramatic crash three years ago and the slowest recovery. This fall, while the offerings at both houses were slim, the results were significant. At each auction, about 80 percent of the contemporary works offered were sold. Christie's sale totaled $15.9 million, just above the low estimate of $15.3 million, and Sotheby's totaled nearly $14 million, right in the middle of Sotheby's estimate of $11.3 million to $15.5 million.
 
Seven Records in One Night
 Sotheby's sale was livelier and set records for seven artists. While only one painting at Sotheby's was expected to sell for more than $1 million, in the end four works brought seven figures. The star work in the sale was Alexander Calder's 14-foot, 6-inch standing mobile "Constellation" (1960). Sotheby's estimated it would bring $500,000 to $700,000, but it sold to an unidentified collector bidding by phone for $1.8 million.
At both Sotheby's and Christie's many works were up for sale that had been at auction not long ago. But this season, prices were dramatically lower and the results were astonishing. An untitled Cy Twombly painting from 1969, which failed to sell two years ago at Sotheby's (the highest bid was $75,000), sold for $162,000 on Wednesday night, well above its $55,000 to $65,000 estimate. "The person who bought it and the underbidder were both at the sale in 1991," said Lucy Mitchell-Innes, director of Sotheby's department of contemporary art. "It shows a new level of confidence."
Despite all the good news, both auction houses worry that the market is still shaky. "We have to continue to be careful about keeping estimates down," Mrs. Brooks said. "If we aren't, this recovery could easily come to a dead halt."

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Female Genital Torture

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
On Oct. 7, H.R. 3247 was introduced, almost unnoticed, in the House of Representatives. It is the first Congressional bill to deal with the most widespread existing violation of human rights in the world.
The bill forbids operations to mutilate female genitalia, a torture committed against millions of women abroad. Some have already taken place in the U.S. 
 With expanding emigration from the 30-odd countries, mostly African, where these ritual mutilations are practiced, the likelihood grows of more occurring in the U.S. Unlike many European countries, the U.S. has no laws prohibiting them.
The bill was introduced by Patricia Schroeder of Colorado and Barbara Rose Collins of Michigan. A few days later, Representative Schroeder mentioned female genital mutilation to a colleague. He did not know what she was talking about.
That conversation, it seems to me, is the issue.
The bill is needed. But it cannot prevent the millions of mutilations committed every year against small girls, leaving them in lifelong pain and sexual deprivation, and making them more vulnerable to disease, infection and early death.
Only two things can do that. One is making sure nobody can say "But I did not know." The other is to organize political and economic action.
Female mutilation is decreed by no religion. But it is passed on, generation to generation, and enforced by custom and religion. Eighty million women now alive are its victims.
The chief instrument of enforcement is not the knife or razor. It is the belief drilled into women that their genitalia and their sexual desires are inherently disgusting. For girls to be marriageable, the genitalia must be controlled -- by cutting, excision and other mutilations.
Representative Schroeder's fact list says the male equivalent would be amputation or cutting of the penis and its surrounding tissues -- a description that should get any Congressman's attention.
One form of mutilation is removal of the clitoris and labia minora. Infibulation, another form, is the removal of the external genitalia, the stitching up of the two sides of the vulva, sometimes with thorns, and the insertion of a sliver to keep only a small opening for the passage of urine and menstrual blood -- all done without anesthetic while the child is held down.
Does that clear it up for Representative Schroeder's colleague? So now he knows.
Judged against its reach and hideousness, no other existing violation of human decency has received so little government and journalistic attention. But not everybody has been silent.
U.N. commissions have passed resolutions. In the West organizations like NOW, Population Action International, the Women's International Network and others have spread information.
Hanny Lightfoot-Klein wrote the important "Prisoners of Ritual" 14 years ago. Alice Walker wrote a novel on the subject and has taken part in a new film, "Warrior Marks." On TV, Charlayne Hunter-Gault did a documentary for public television, and ABC moved ahead of the other major networks with a fine piece for "Day One." In print journalism, The Atlanta Journal and Constitution have been particularly good.
So if many people really do know, why has so little been done? The major responsibility belongs to the governments where mutilation is practiced as part of life, or death.
The former colonial governments and present independent governments either sidestepped the whole thing or accepted it as custom and ritual too dangerous to handle. A few African governments are now trying to do something, and should get help.
The rest of the world has simply failed to take obvious steps. In the U.S., all political and social groups that care could pool talents and clout to shake Washington awake.
The U.S. could bring this atrocity before the major bodies of the U.N. The goal could be to use international clout: give special help to governments fighting mutilation on their soil, cut grants and loans to governments that refuse or stall.
The lack of action in the West -- it must come from bias and disdain, not just against women and blacks by others, but also against women and blacks by themselves. Else, once knowing, they would never again look away.

Devil in the Details

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

 BODY:
The Israel-P.L.O. Declaration of Principles signed on Sept. 13 calls for all implementing plans to be agreed by Dec. 13 and the Palestinians then to assume authority in Gaza and Jericho. A month before that date, with Prime Minister Rabin again in the United States, the necessary agreements are far from completion.
In the declaration the two parties took the essential step of mutual recognition. But all the details of how to govern a dense urban population like Gaza's -- the size and powers of a Palestinian police force, for example -- were left to be negotiated. 
 "It was a beautiful ceremony on the White House lawn," a high Israeli official said. "But in practice the declaration said very little."
Failure to meet the Dec. 13 target date would carry serious risks. For in the view of the Rabin Government, it is only by showing that promises will be carried out on the ground that peace can be made credible to Palestinians -- and can draw in the neighboring Arab states, notably Syria.
After a lame start under the eyes of journalists, one negotiating committee of Israelis and Palestinians moved to a secret location in Cairo. There they have made progress on a ticklish question, the scope of Israel's military withdrawal from the Gaza and Jericho areas: where the troops will go, how many will remain to protect Jewish settlers and so on.
But another important negotiating committee has not started work. It will decide economic questions that greatly concern Israel. For example: Will there be an open relationship between Israel and a future Palestinian entity in the West Bank and Gaza? How will taxes be arranged? Customs duties?
The P.L.O. has been slow even to name its economic negotiators. The committee is now scheduled to meet for the first time Monday in Paris.
The tardiness of the P.L.O. on that issue reflects a fundamental problem in these talks. On one side there is a state, used to the hard business of governing. On the other there is a body, the P.L.O., that is torn by individual and ideological conflicts and that has no experience in running the life of a community.
The odds must be against meeting the Dec. 13 target. Nevertheless, I think there is reason for some optimism about the outlook for peace in the Middle East.
The Rabin Government has a great stake in the success of its agreement with the P.L.O., as hardly needs to be said. That is why Mr. Rabin has been pressing for international aid to the new Palestinian institutions -- to show Palestinians that peace can actually improve their lives.
More broadly, the handshake between Mr. Rabin and Yasir Arafat has opened possibilities for Israel in parts of the world that formerly shunned it. Though Arab states have refused to lift their economic boycott, for example, several have quietly begun talking about financial deals.
Then there is the hope of peace with Syria, which would be the great prize for Israel's security. Prime Minister Rabin has made clear that he does not look for any early breakthrough on that front. Syria will wait to see the concrete results of the P.L.O. agreement. So there again Israel has a deep interest in seeing that it comes to fruition.
Peace has also developed a tangible political momentum among Palestinians since the Sept. 13 signing. Even in Gaza, where the Islamic fundamentalist movement Hamas has been strong, support for the P.L.O. is said to have increased sharply. In Jordan, with its majority Palestinian population, fundamentalists lost ground in the election this week.
Hamas is trying to counter the momentum for peace. In the last two weeks its terrorists have killed three Israeli civilians in the occupied territories, with the obvious purpose of arousing Israelis against the agreement with the P.L.O.
Israeli settlers have rioted. But the main body of Israeli opinion has apparently not been moved -- indeed, some reports say people living in Israel proper have been troubled by the settlers' lawlessness. The general impression since Sept. 13 is that for most Israelis, after all their years of war, the palpable hope of peace has very strong attraction.
"The P.L.O. agreement created an entirely new atmosphere for Israel," the high Israeli official said, "all over the world. The problem now is not atmosphere. It is making the agreement work."

HEADLINE: Why Americans Distrust Clinton on Trade Pact

 BODY:
To the Editor:
James Carville, Bill Clinton's 1992 campaign manager, of all people, should know better than to waste his time joining Tony Snow, a George Bush speechwriter, pontificating on behalf of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Op-Ed, Nov. 2). Mr. Carville should have spent that time reminding his President of the reasons Americans fear the agreement to begin with, and telling him what to do about it. 
 For the majority of American workers, wages have declined since 1973. Meanwhile, inequality has soared, as the richest 20 percent of the population has reaped whatever gains a slow-growing economy has made. According to some studies, the overall effect of economic globalization is to exacerbate the increase in inequality in this country. Americans fear -- rightly or wrongly, but understandably -- that the trade agreement will accelerate these trends.
President Clinton should realize that he cannot expect Americans to trust him on the North American Free Trade Agreement until he reassures them he is committed to raising wages and combating inequality. In the campaign, Mr. Clinton proved that he knew the grim statistics, and he promised to fight for American workers. He downplayed deficit reduction and talked about things like investment in infrastructure, a massive national service program and requiring employers to devote a percentage of revenue to job retraining.
But in the course of the budget wars, the "investment" budget shrank to a pittance, and national service became a pilot program. The retraining requirement has been forgotten. And the Administration has shown little enthusiasm for any increase in the minimum wage.
In short, Bill Clinton has given American workers little reason to believe that he is on their side. Thus, when they are told that the North American Free Trade Agreement is a sellout to big corporations, they tend to think it's true.
The trade agreement may be merely symbolic, but the problems it symbolizes are all-important. Mr. Clinton should have spent some political capital addressing those problems before he asked Americans to swallow a trade agreement that they suspect will make the problems worse.

HEADLINE: Why Americans Distrust Clinton on Trade Pact;
Retraining's Failure

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The views expressed by Tony Snow and James Carville in "Victory Made (Sort of) Easy" (Op-Ed, Nov. 2) are loaded with pro-North American Free Trade Agreement and pro-business arguments. What happens if the rewards outlined by these two insiders aren't harvested? Maybe earning the equivalent of their Mexican counterparts would be their reward. 
 Our beleaguered economy is already encountering a pre-trade agreement employment crisis by not creating sufficient jobs with good pay for United States workers. Sears, I.B.M., Boeing, Procter & Gamble, Woolworth and General Motors have all announced employment cutbacks of some 200,000 workers in the next 28 months (not to mention cancellation of the supercollider project in Texas). The trade agreement won't restore those jobs.
The bottom line is that proponents of the North American Free Trade Agreement, including these two political observers, must prove that the trade pact will not result in lower wages for American workers. That's what the North American Free Trade Agreement is all about.
President Clinton promises to cushion the short-term jobs fall-out from the North American Free Trade Agreement with retraining dollars for "dislocated" workers. However, retraining workers is not so easy as originally thought. A Labor Department study of Government job-training programs for workers hurt by foreign trade in 1991 found that one in five retrained workers landed jobs paying at least 80 percent as much as their former jobs. This retraining program cost United States taxpayers $200 million. What waste!
The North American Free Trade Agreement is good for investors and big business only; it's bad for American workers.

Past Promises Unkept

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In the heated debate over the probable economic consequences of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico, surprisingly little attention has been paid to the accuracy of past predictions about development along the border.
In 1965 business leaders lobbied successfully for a border industrialization program, predicting that factories would spring up all along the United States side of the border in tandem with Mexican border development: the twin plant concept.
On the other hand, Ernesto Galarza, farmworker chronicler, was skeptical. In 1967 he requested in vain that the Border Commission include in its membership Mexican labor people from both sides of the border to work toward raising "Mexican levels of income to American standards," not "lowering American to present Mexican ones." Otherwise, he predicted, "goods will be manufactured at Mexican wages and reimported for sale at American prices."
Given past misguided business predictions, why should we rely on the assurances about the trade agreement?

HEADLINE: Courts Also Must Take Battering Seriously

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Whose Shocking Crime?" (Op-Ed, Nov. 5) by Annie Gottlieb puts the case of the severing of a batterer's penis in perspective. Battering of women results in severe physical and emotional harm to millions of women in the United States. However, Ms. Gottlieb, like many others, has been misled by exaggerated reports that police studies prove that arrest does not deter batterers. 
 The National Center on Women and Family Law has completed "Must We Stop Arresting Batterers?: Analysis and Policy Implications of New Police Domestic Violence Studies," a review and analysis of those studies. The findings of lack of deterrence in those studies is limited to unemployed, socially marginal batterers. Even that conclusion is questionable because the methodology of the studies is seriously flawed.
Indeed, the studies show a strong deterrent effect overall. This is particularly impressive because domestic violence usually escalates unless society intervenes effectively.
By isolating police response from other parts of the legal system, the studies fail to consider the very real effect that court and prosecution have on the abuser. The problem with mandatory arrest may be that even when we require the police to take domestic violence seriously, the courts still don't.

HEADLINE: Tapping a Rich Smoking Frontier

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PRAGUE

 BODY:
Andreas Gembler, the head of the Philip Morris International tobacco operations in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, points to a simple statistic to explain the company's decision to sink nearly $1 billion into the region after the collapse of Communism. About 700 billion cigarettes are sold there annually, making the market 40 percent larger than that of the United States.
"No industry can ignore the consumer in this part of the world," Mr. Gembler said. 
 At the Czech Ministry of Health, Dr. Jiri T. Kozak is pondering another statistic. The percentage of Czechs who are smokers, he said, has risen to 37.5 percent, from 35 percent in 1989, when the Berlin wall fell and Eastern Europe began opening in earnest to, among others, the Marlboro Man, Joe Camel and the rest of the Western tobacco industry. In the United States, an estimated 25 to 27 percent of adults smoke.
"Until the arrival of the transnational tobacco companies and the beginning of aggressive advertising, the prevalence of smoking was decreasing," said Dr. Kozak, an adviser to the ministry who is helping to prepare legislation to restrict cigarette advertising.
 
Looking for Growth
 Confronted with flat or shrinking markets in America and Western Europe, as well as a precipitous drop in profits in the United States, tobacco companies are counting on the rest of the world for growth. The trend has encompassed Latin America, Africa and Asia. But no region has captured more of the industry's money lately than the former Soviet bloc, where Philip Morris and R. J. Reynolds of the United States, B.A.T. Industries of Britain, Reemstma of Germany and other companies are forging joint ventures and making acquisitions.
Their investments, which total more than $1.5 billion, have bought them a large presence in countries extending as far east as Kazakhstan in central Asia, where Philip Morris agreed in September to pay more than $200 million to acquire control of the Government-owned cigarette factory. Still to come are privatization programs in Poland and the full-scale opening of the tobacco industry in Russia.
As they looked out on the cities and towns where billboards and alluring slogans herald capitalism ("L& M: The Way America Tastes"), tobacco executives said they were confident in their strategy.
But the tobacco companies will face formidable obstacles and some controversy. A look at the biggest deal completed so far -- Philip Morris's acquisition of a controlling stake in Tabak, the formerly state-owned tobacco company in the Czech Republic -- illustrates the potential and pitfalls for the industry.
Philip Morris, the largest tobacco company in the world and the maker of Marlboros, won a bidding war by agreeing last year to pay $400 million to acquire a controlling interest in the company and modernize its five plants -- the only tobacco factories in the Czech Republic.
Philip Morris got factories that are considered among the best in Eastern Europe, though far below Western standards. Perhaps most important, Philip Morris acquired a portfolio of local brands that were extremely strong sellers and a chance to increase the sales of Marlboro and its other Western brands.
 
A Growing Share
 Tabak controls 62.5 percent of the combined Czech and Slovak markets, according to Philip Morris, up from 60 percent before the acquisition. In the Czech market alone, the figure is probably closer to 75 percent, prompting grumbling from competitors that the Czech Government has been too slow to allow other Western cigarette companies to begin manufacturing in the country.
Mr. Gembler said that on an operating basis Tabak was already profitable. But analysts said Philip Morris might wait a long time for the investment to pay off, because profit margins in Eastern Europe were a fraction of those in the West, and the ability to raise prices was limited.
Emanuel Goldman, an analyst for Paine Webber in San Francisco, said that in the former Soviet bloc, the company made $2.29 for each 1,000 cigarettes sold last year. In the European Community, in contrast, it made $6.03. In the United States, the margin was $24.23 for 1,000 cigarettes last year, though Philip Morris's move earlier this year to slash prices has driven down margins in the United States to $15.82, he said.
 
Unit Sales Lower
 Retail prices are up sharply this year in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, but primarily because of tax increases. At the same time, the region's economic teething pains and the effects of the recession in neighboring Germany -- the biggest export market and the primary source of foreign investment -- have lowered total unit sales by more than 2 percent this year.
Much of Philip Morris's investment has gone to modernize Tabak's main plant in Kutna Hora, 40 miles from Prague. The plant's decades-old cigarette-making machines ground the tobacco unevenly, and the machines could not weigh the tobacco used in each cigarette, so each cigarette would burn differently. Packaging machines often put cellophane wrappers on unevenly.
All that has changed, said Leon Dediot, the manager of operations for Tabak. The new machinery has been put in, and the old equipment is being rebuilt.
 
Emphasizing the Familiar
 In the long run, Mr. Gembler said, Western brands like Marlboro will be the big sellers in Eastern markets. But for now, he said, Philip Morris is happy to emphasize the familiar, affordable local brands.
Of the top 10 brands in the combined Czech and Slovak market, 8 are produced by Tabak, including 4 of the top 5. The two leading brands are Tabak's Petra and Petra Lights. Marlboro, which sells for the equivalent of $1.20 a pack, 60 percent more than Petra, ranks fifth and is the best-selling international brand.
To support its products, Philip Morris has become one of the biggest advertisers in the region.
Smoking here has never had the social stigma it has acquired in America. Dr. Jaroslav Kriz, the chief hygienist for the Czech Ministry of Health, noted a study showing that 52 percent of surgeons are smokers.
But governments, with the encouragement of groups like the World Health Organization, have taken up the anti-smoking cause. With their tobacco industries now largely in foreign hands, they have become more aggressive in their attacks.
"The transnational tobacco companies exploit our countries' desperate need for immediate economic investment," public health officials from 13 former Soviet bloc nations, including the Czech Republic, said in a letter to President Clinton in September. "But in so doing they damage our health and ruin our longer-term economic well-being."
Legislators in the Czech Republic, like those in many other Eastern European countries, are debating restrictions on tobacco advertising. Poland has adopted some that will take effect in 1995. In Hungary, several companies, including Philip Morris, have been fined for violations.
So far Philip Morris, along with the advertising industry, has headed off legislation in the Czech Republic, in part by casting the issue as one of free speech, not an issue that any politician at this point in the country's history is eager to be seen opposing.
Mr. Gembler said Philip Morris did not oppose advertising restrictions, but said they should be drafted in an open legislative process and define what was permissible. Czech officials said compromise legislation was likely in a year or two.
Philip Morris already faces advertising restrictions in almost every Western market. Still, neither Philip Morris nor any other tobacco company has shown any less interest in Eastern Europe because of the issue.
Mr. Gembler said the company was pleased with the results of its strategy in countries like the Czech Republic and Hungary. And while progress in countries like Russia and the former Soviet republics will be much slower, he said, ultimately they will be very attractive markets.
"The question is, can you afford not to be there?" Mr. Gembler said.

HEADLINE: Mere Hint of Jobs Draws Crowd in Detroit

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Nov. 11

 BODY:
In this city's troubled downtown, thousands of people lined up in the cold this morning to apply for jobs that may never exist. The applicants, mostly black, were hoping to work in a casino to be run by Greek-American businessmen on behalf of an Indian tribe based in Northern Michigan.
But the casino appears to have little chance of winning approval, which means the long line probably served as little more than a gauge of the desperation of people unable to find full-time work in a city that once boomed with the auto trade. 
 The casino's sponsors say the project would help revive downtown's boarded-up department stores, office towers and stately theaters. With Detroit's unemployment at 13 percent, almost double the national rate, the prospect of jobs with benefits -- any jobs -- led hundreds of would-be workers to turn out by 7 A.M., three hours before applications were available.
 
Desperation in Motor City
 "It's pitiful," said Roosevelt Albritton, standing near the end of the line, which snaked back and forth through blocked-off streets over two blocks. "This is the auto industry town. It should never have to go through this."
For the casino to open, Federal and state officials must permit a block of downtown Detroit to be taken into trust for the Indian tribe, the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians, to make it part of a reservation some 350 miles north of here.
With that prospect in deep doubt, Dennis Archer, the city's Mayor-elect and an opponent of the plan, said the casino job offer was cruelly raising false hopes. The casino's sponsors announced the offer in Sunday's newspapers, which warned that no one would be hired until the plan was approved.
 
'Nothing Else Happening'
 But the patiently waiting applicants said they had no alternatives. "Nobody else is saying, We've got 4,000 jobs," said Bessie Sibbaluca, who said she has been raising two children on part-time jobs and social assistance for more than three years. "There's nothing else happening but crime."
The last solicitation for a large number of jobs came from the post office, she said. It promised 300 jobs over three or four years.
Most of the auto jobs disappeared long ago; Mr. Albritton, 45, lost his in the late 1970's. While some businesses and neighborhoods still thrive in Detroit, the grim remnants of the blue-collar paradise that slipped away with the industry are everywhere: the silent, sprawling brick factories; the deserted wood-frame houses with doorways gaping; the vacant lots, where grass grows waist-deep in summer.
Now, Mr. Albritton said, "The American dream isn't here anymore."
The casino, in some ways, has the earmarks of a desperation move by businessmen in one of the city's still-vibrant pockets. The casino would be in an area called Greektown, at night an island of bustling restaurants and bright lights amid the dark streets.
Mayor-elect Archer called the offer of 4,415 jobs like dealing cards or spinning roulette wheels an effort to build political pressure. Referring to the businessmen, he said in an interview today: "They've confirmed what all of us know in the city, that we've got some outstanding people who would like the dignity of good-paying jobs. I would respectfully represent to you that if you went to any city in the United States and said, 'We have 4,000 jobs,' you would create a line."
Ted Gatzaros, one of the businessmen who would operate the casino for the Chippewas, said he had to solicit applications now to have time to train the workers for the casino's planned opening in June to coincide with the World's Cup in nearby Pontiac. Base wages of $16,000 to $18,000 would be paid for work cleaning bathrooms to dealing blackjack to spinning the roulette wheels.
In addition, he said, 11,000 jobs will open up around the casino for tour guides, jewelers, bakers, baby sitters, taxi drivers and others.
 
Governor Is Opposed
 By the end of the day, more than 10,000 people had filled out applications, and many more had picked them up, the casino's backers said. The Detroit police had no crowd estimates.
Gov. John Engler opposes Indian casino gambling in Detroit if it does not benefit all seven of Michigan's tribes and if it is not part of a larger urban revitalization plan. "The tribe has failed to meet the minimum conditions that the Governor has set down," said Michael Gadola, the Governor's deputy legal counsel.
Before the proposal reaches the Governor's desk, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt must approve taking the land into trust. He has not yet indicated how or when he will decide, a spokesman said.
Residents of Detroit have voted down casino gambling in the city four times. But if the land is taken into trust, their approval would not be necessary, a fact that enrages some city leaders.
"Something is being forced on us that we have rejected as a community," said the Rev. Jim Holley, president of the Council of Baptist Pastors of Detroit and Vicinity. "We're not looking for a war on anyone, but it's not something the Indian community would let us do to them."
 
'50 Years of Depression
 On the reservation on Michigan's Upper Peninsula, gambling has already created a boom for the tribe. "Detroit is similar to the Sault," said Bernard Bouschor, the tribal chairman, or chief. "We had 50 years of depression." About 1,500 members of the tribe live in Detroit, a city of about one million.
Throughout Michigan, the seven Indian tribes now run eight casinos, but Mr. Gadola said the operations were not legal. The state has agreed to a compact governing gambling at those casinos, but that agreement is awaiting Mr. Babbitt's approval. Meanwhile, Federal officials have not taken action against them.
Mr. Bouschor and his business partners have promised the city $20 million annually from the casino, over and above the cost of city services, and the state another $32 million.
It is unclear whether the state could accept the funds, however. Under the 1988 Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, states may recoup their costs for providing services to casinos, but may not profit from them, said Bob Walker, a spokesman for the Department of the Interior.
Unlike casinos in Atlantic City, he said, the casino proposed by the Chippewas will benefit surrounding business because it will offer few services besides gambling. "It's gaming and bathrooms," he said. "They don't want to create fortresses of greed."
Mr. Gatzaros said he saw business at his restaurants and hotel in Greektown plunge 50 percent in two years. Suburbanites, he said, have been scared off by what he called exaggerated reports of crime downtown.
 
'Have a Job for Me?'
 He also said that city leaders who pine for the return of high-wage auto jobs needed to explore alternatives. "People are desperate," he said. "They're waking up and realizing those jobs are never going to happen again."
As they waited in line, applicants said that unless the casino's critics could supply another option, they should stand aside.
"Do they have a job for me?" asked Ponchita Flowers, 45, a former executive secretary who said she had been searching for a full-time job for six years. "If they have a job for me, fine, I'll come see them tomorrow."
"Yesterday," amended Gloria Chapman, 49, who was standing in line behind Mrs. Flowers.

HEADLINE: The Future Is Coming

BYLINE: By Timothy Ferris; Timothy Ferris, professor of journalism at the University of California at Berkeley, is senior producer of the forthcoming PBS series "Future Quest."

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
Why doesn't America know where it is going? U.S. foreign and military policy is swerving like a drunken driver without a map. . . . We are undergoing the deepest rearrangement of global power since the birth of industrial civilization.
-- Alvin Toffler and Heidi Toffler, Op-Ed page, Oct. 31, 1993.
Why is American foreign policy lurching like a drunken driver without a map? To answer that vital question, we need to set aside the obsolete world map that befuddled policy makers have been consulting and turn to a new map -- specifically, the 1993 Universal World Globe. 
 We find that there are three sorts of nations -- those with muddy colors, yellow and brown, like India and China; those with cooler, "Miami Vice" hues of blue and green, like Singapore, Lithuania and the nations of the Malay Archipelago, and those that display a confetti-like array of bright colors, like the U.S., Japan, Western Europe and the Cape Verde Islands.
As the hypersonic winds of change blow us all down the corridors of future history, it becomes clear that these states have sharply differing interests. Mud-colored nations need seed bags, Archimedes' screws, insect repellent and audio cassettes recorded on only one side. The priorities of cool-tone nations lean toward bedroom air-conditioners, cigarette papers and powerful X-ray machines for checking whether shoes fit.
The confetti-colored nations are very different. They don't need food, water, and transportation, but information. They require high-speed C.P.U.'s, giant TV screens, comfy sofas and coasters. Without leaving their couches, citizens of these third-hue nations will soon be able to calculate their taxes, look up "bird" in the Grolier's Encyclopedia or watch grandmothers be shot by snipers in Sarajevo from six camera angles.
Of course, these divisions are not absolute. Even in mud-colored nations, a few people watch TV or play Gameboy. Every once in a while someone in a cool-tone region grooms a water buffalo or lights a fire to stay warm. Some among the confetti peoples upholster couches or grow potatoes. But these overlaps should not blind us to the powerful forces shaping the very nature of futurology. Confetti will fly everywhere, and policy makers who don't smell the coffee had better get their heads out of the fan.
When we take these prospects together, there emerges a vision of a new world in which traditional political boundaries count for little. Once mighty states like Italy, Germany and the Benelux nations are doomed to be replaced by such emerging centers of info-power as Orange County, Calif., and Champaign-Urbana, Ill.
With the dinosaur governments of Japan, the U.S. and Russia paralyzed by thousands of treaties and regulations thoughtlessly inked by their old-think leaders, vital decisions about whether, say, to explore Mars or dispatch a carrier wing to the Indian Ocean will be left to free-wheeling confetti states like Ifni and Nauru.
Dwarfing even this change will be the revolutionary economic transformations wrought by the coming info-age. Studies commissioned by the Home Shopping Channel show that more buying power is wielded by just one confetti-nation subgroup -- divorced fathers living in trailer parks who own a remote control TV and at least one automatic pistol -- than by the former Warsaw Pact nations combined. In the emerging world of fiber-optic networks, such economic clout will be combined with instant access to information ranging from high school basketball scores to promotion prospects for stenographers born under the sign of Libra.
Where it will all go, know few -- and most of them work in my think tank. As wave upon wave of digitized change washes across a changing world, U.S. policy will continue to swerve drunkenly across the globe until its leaders wake up and start hiring futurologists.

HEADLINE: A Graver Jackson's Cry: Overcome the Violence!

BYLINE: By DON TERRY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The Rev. Jesse Jackson's star has dimmed a bit. At 52, he is graying at the temples, and his heart seems heavier than it was in the 1970's, when he sought to sway a generation of black teen-agers to believe, and repeat, "I am somebody." When he talks with teen-agers these days, it is not about the promise of tomorrow but about the dangers of today.
"Stop the violence!" Mr. Jackson thunders. "Save the children!" 
 Until then, hope will have to wait.
Mr. Jackson says he cannot remember a time when so much of black America was in such deep danger and despair because of drugs and violence, unemployment and disease.
 
Part of Culture, He Says
 Poverty and racism still do their devil's work. But nowadays the threat to life and limb and liberty often grows up just down the street. Young black men and boys are killing one another, Mr. Jackson says, in a storm of "self-destruction." Baby sister and little brother are dying in the crossfire.
But this isn't happening in a vacuum; the violence among blacks, he says, is rooted in a national culture -- shared by people of every color in the country's rainbow -- that is drawn to the power of the gun, particularly as a means to settle disputes, big and small, in the street and in the home.
For Mr. Jackson and a growing number of prominent black clergy members, writers and community leaders, ending the violence has become a crusade. He calls it the "new frontier of the civil rights movement."
Long-term answers will have to include jobs and schools, the nuts and bolts of life, Mr. Jackson says, but in the meantime people are dying.
Mr. Jackson has been traveling the country preaching to black audiences to do-for-self, to take responsibility for ending the carnage in their streets. And lately, he has been getting a lot of attention from news organizations and even from President Clinton.
"No one else will do it for us but us," he says. It is a sentiment passed down from generation to generation, like the family Bible. For Mr. Jackson it is a self-evident truth.
"When it's black on black, there seems to be a zone of permissiveness about crime," he says. "That has got to stop."
But he says permissiveness and acceptance of killing has also seeped into the souls of too many black people, and that troubles him the most. He wants black students to be on the front lines in the war on guns, self-hate, greed and violence, much as their parents' generation was in the forefront when the enemies were Klansmen, dream-crushing laws and governors blocking the schoolhouse door.
The man who spent recent years telling students to "keep hope alive" is now telling them to stand up to the thugs among them and to break the student "code of silence" that allows Johnny to sit in class with a pocket full of dope and a 9-millimeter pistol in his waistband. Turn Johnny in, he says.
"It's not snitching," he recently insisted to a group of skeptical students at Roosevelt High School in Washington. "It's self-defense."
A senior, DeMone Perry, shook his head at what he later said was Mr. Jackson's naivete or "old age" about what it takes to survive in the streets. "You need some kind of protection," the youth said, "because nobody else is going to stop a bullet for you."
He said almost everyone he knew carried a gun or a knife to school, including some teachers. He said he would not "snitch" because the police had their own code of silence that protected crooked officers and allowed them to rob, cheat, steal and sell drugs like criminals.
"I'm sorry, sir," the youth told Mr. Jackson. "This is 1993, not 1963. I don't know where you've been."
Mr. Jackson put his hand on the student's shoulder and said, "I've been to a lot of teen-age funerals."
 
Recapturing Spotlight
 Mr. Jackson has also been to a lot of news conferences.
Adolph L. Reed Jr., a political science professor at Northwestern University who wrote "The Jesse Jackson Phenomenon," a book published in 1986 by Yale University Press, says that now, with attention on a new group of more moderate black political leaders, Mr. Jackson's talk of self-help to fight crime is one sure way to recapture the spotlight that dimmed so much for him last year during the Presidential election campaign.
"Jackson has been marginalized within the Democratic Party," Mr. Reed said. "He's been trying to figure out for some time what to do with himself and how to assert his presence on the national stage."
Not long after the Presidential campaign, he failed to recapture that spotlight when at the 11th hour he withdrew from consideration as executive director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Although Mr. Jackson was clearly the most well-known of the candidates, questions were raised about whether he was best suited for the post.
For others, Mr. Jackson's current campaign comes dangerously close to blame-the-victim oratory, and it lets the bigger -- and whiter -- society off the hook of responsibility.
Richard Majors, a psychologist on leave from the University of Wisconsin and a founding member of the National Council on African American Men, said Mr. Jackson and other leaders must be careful not to put too much of the burden for change solely on the weary shoulders of black America.
"We've paid a black tax in terms of our blood, sweat and tears," Mr. Majors said. "The solution may begin in looking at ourselves but it doesn't end there. Considering unemployment, poverty and racism, I think black males have done very well."
Carl Upchurch, a founder of a national effort to get street gangs to stop fighting, said, "Unless we get the larger society to live up to its responsibilities to justice and equality, then these kids aren't going to change."
"These kids aren't the problem," he said. "They are the symptom."
In another sign of how deep the crisis seems to be, people and organizations who have kept their distance for years are starting to come together to oppose violence. A few weeks ago, the Congressional Black Caucus embraced the Nation of Islam leader, Minister Louis Farrakhan, partly because he is such a hero in some of the hardest-hit and most difficult-to-reach pockets of urban America.
 
'A Sacred Mission'
 Benjamin Chavis, the executive director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, has been traveling from city to city, encouraging gang members to put down their guns. "This is a sacred mission," he said at a recent gang peace meeting in Chicago.
Mr. Jackson and Mr. Farrakhan addressed the same gathering.
In recent weeks, from Washington to Oakland, he has been mixing shock therapy with theology, pep talks with homicide statistics, in a series of speeches to inner-city high school students about their singular role in ending the "madness."
He asks the students to pledge that "my school and my community will no longer be a sanctuary for dope pushers, gunslingers and killers."
He has started a project called "Reclaim Our Youth," a program to counsel and to provide mentors for teen-agers that he hopes to see operating soon in 1,000 churches across the country.
"So we can get the kids before the streets do," he explained.
On the road, he bellows: Stop killing each other! Stop in the name of the grandmothers who worked two jobs to support you, and stop in the name of the college students who died in some southern swamp so all Americans could vote. In the name of God. Stop.
"You have the power to do that right now," he says. "You have the power to choose life over death and hope over dope."
The students near the stage at Roosevelt roared yes, they would sign his pledge. A group of boys in back slumped in their seats, smirking as they watched a teacher pull a girl out of the auditorium.
"She's using all sorts of vulgarities," the teacher said to another.
"So what?" the girl said. "You wouldn't understand no way."
She did not get to hear much of Mr. Jackson's message. Sam Hartwell, 19, did and said his mother would faint when he got home and told her how close he had been to Mr. Jackson.
"He's a great leader," Sam said. "So I'll listen to him. But it's easy for him to talk about giving up guns and drugs. He don't have to live with the same problems we do.
"Some people bring guns to school because their lives are in danger. He has body guards, we don't. He has money, we don't. You watch, somebody is going to get killed tonight. I'm going to do my best to make sure it ain't me."

HEADLINE: Phone Company to Cut Its Work Force by 14%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN, Conn., Nov. 12

 BODY:
Southern New England Telecommunications Corporation said today that it would lay off up to 1,500 employees, or 14 percent of its work force, to become more competitive in a changing market.
"We have carefully considered all other possible actions and there are no realistic alternatives to layoffs," said Daniel J. Miglio, president and chief executive officer, in a videotaped message to employees. 
 In recent years, the company has moved gradually to reduce costs and shrink its work force. But with "incredible changes" transforming telecommunications, including the merging of industries, Mr. Miglio said the slow approach had to be abandoned.
 
Management Feels It Too
 Mr. Miglio said 400 to 700 of the 3,600 management employees would be laid off, along with 500 to 800 of the 7,000 union employees.
Industry analysts have been saying that SNET needs to cut up to 3,000 jobs to match the productivity of other phone companies.
Most of those who will lose their jobs are employed in the network operations of the company's largest subsidiary, Southern New England Telephone. They include telephone installers, cable splicers and clerical workers.
Layoffs will begin Jan. 12. Management employees will be notified between Jan. 5 and March 4 and union workers starting Jan. 27.
The company had earlier offered financial incentives to most of its work force to leave voluntarily, but only a small number have accepted, said Beverly Levy, a spokeswoman for the company.
"The numbers are low and really don't make a significant dent in the number of jobs we have to downsize," she said.
Ms. Levy said the company could not be more specific because "we're still working on a radical reorganization and restructuring."
Improved technologies make the job cutbacks possible, the company said.
Southern New England Telephone's revenues have been flat during the last five years as the state has endured its worst recession since the Great Depression.
Adding to the pressures on SNET, the company began facing competition this year on intrastate long-distance phone services, and has seen revenues drop as a result, Ms. Levy said. The company's new competitors include A.T.&T., MCI and Sprint.
Employees were reluctant to discuss the announcement during their lunch hour today, and those who would comment did not want to be identified.
 
Workers Saw It Coming
 A market researcher said most employees knew layoffs were coming and accepted that cutbacks were necessary.
"I guess my job is in jeopardy as well as everyone else's," the researcher said. "But if the company is going to be viable, it's going to have to make some hard decisions."
The Connecticut Union of Telephone Workers, which represents 7,000 SNET employees, did not challenge the need for the cutbacks.
"We certainly feel for those who lose their jobs," said Jim Grinberg, a union spokesman. "We're unhappy about it."
But realistically, Mr. Grinberg said, "the company is not a nonprofit organization" and had to find ways to deal with the state's lingering recession, increased competition and changing technology.
Blue-collar workers at SNET have until Nov. 30 to accept the company's buyout offer, which provides employees as much as $26,000 in a lump-sum payment based on years of service. The management buyout offer did not have a deadline. SNET said it would disclose next week how many accepted the offer.
In his 10-minute message to employees, which was shown throughout the day today and will be replayed Monday, Mr. Miglio called his action "the most gut-wrenching decision I have ever had to make in my 30-plus years at SNET."

HEADLINE: NATIONS BACK BAN ON ATOMIC DUMPING

BYLINE: By DAVID E. PITT

 BODY:
Capping a series of actions hailed by environmentalists as a turning point in the protection of the world's oceans, the United States and 36 other governments voted yesterday to impose a permanent, legally binding ban on the dumping of all types of radioactive waste at sea.
The vote to ban dumping of low-level radioactive wastes came at a meeting in London of 42 of the 71 nations that signed a 1972 treaty on ocean dumping. Five of the countries represented at the meeting -- Russia, Britain, France, China and Belgium -- abstained from the vote. 
 On Thursday the signers of the treaty also approved two less intensely debated measures, approving permanent prohibitions on ocean dumping of toxic industrial wastes and waste incineration at sea. The agreement's "black list" of prohibited materials already includes highly radioactive wastes.
Diplomats say the actions will transform the treaty -- known as the London Convention -- from an agreement regulating marine dumping to one aimed at preventing the practice whenever there is reasonable doubt about its ecological soundness.
 
Modest Step, Big Problem
 In terms of the overall problem of ocean pollution, the bans constitute a modest step: deliberate dumping of nuclear and toxic industrial wastes at sea constitutes only about 10 percent of the total that enters the ocean. Up to 80 percent originates from such sources as raw sewage, airborne wastes and runoff of pesticides and fertilizer.
But environmental groups believe that the governments' actions in London this week are a sign that they may eventually come to grips with the much larger problem of land-based marine pollution, which Clifton Curtis, a treaties expert with Greenpeace International, described as "far more complicated in technical, legal, political and economic terms."
"What they did here is a sign of a real commitment to view the oceans very differently than before," Mr. Curtis said in a telephone interview from London, where Greenpeace -- which began campaigning for permanent dumping bans 15 years ago -- was monitoring the conference. "It sends a very positive signal."
Any of the 71 signatories, including the 5 that abstained from yesterday's vote, have the right to refuse to comply with changes to the treaty if they file notice within 100 days. The measure approved yesterday replaces a 10-year-old nonbinding moratorium. It is to take effect in 100 days, and includes a provision for a scientific review after 25 years.
Russia, which has been dumping nuclear wastes into the ocean for decades, said it would have to resume dumping low-level radioactive garbage after 18 months unless it receives assistance from the West to build more land-based storage areas.
The plea for aid was dismissed as unconvincing by the chief American delegate, David A. Colson, who noted that Russia spends "enormous sums of money" on its nuclear fleet.
"You will not convince me, and you will not convince the American people, that if the Russian Government so chose, it could not reallocate its priorities and immediately build and quickly have in place adequate storage and processing facilities," Mr. Colson told delegates on Thursday.
Adoption of the ban comes less than a month after a Russian tanker, shadowed by a Greenpeace vessel, pumped more than 900 tons of low-level waste into a squid-fishing ground in the Sea of Japan. The episode, days after the Japanese and Russian Governments had pledged a new era of cooperation, set off a storm of protest. Soon after, on Oct. 21, Japan announced that it would support a permanent ban.
 
Clinton Shifts U.S. Policy
 On Nov. 1, a Clinton Administration official disclosed that, after nearly a year of deliberations, it had decided to reverse American policy and also support such a ban. Participants in the London meeting said the shift, championed by the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, was a decisive factor in yesterday's vote.
The decision in London follows years of controversy over the suspected -- but still largely unproven -- dangers of dumping of low-level radioactive wastes on marine ecosystems. Proponents of the ban argued that the wastes could be retransmitted to humans through the food chain. They also warned that it was risky to dump radioactive material without means to monitor and, if necessary, retrieve it.
The ban, originally proposed by Denmark, is in line with a measure approved at the so-called Earth Summit in Brazil last year, when 172 governments urged the treaty signatories to consider banning low-level dumping as a precaution.
But Britain and France, which fought an 11th-hour battle for a compromise short of a permanent ban, questioned whether low-level waste dumping posed a real danger, and complained that a permanent prohibition would complicate the problem of what to do with growing accumulations of low-level wastes, much of it from decommissioned submarines, nuclear power plants and hospitals.

HEADLINE: THE FREE TRADE ACCORD;
Clinton Extends an Unusual Offer to Republicans on the Pact

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 12

 BODY:
Administration officials worked today to nail down a solid base of support for the North American Free Trade Agreement as members of Congress returned to their home districts to face constituents this weekend.
President Clinton even promised to defend any Republican incumbent against a Democratic challengers' attack if it was based on the incumbent's vote for Nafta, as the trade agreement is known. 
 Several previously undecided members of Congress, including two Democratic Representatives, Nita M. Lowey of New York and Richard Lehman of California, announced they would support the pact, and White House officials said they expected similar support to come Saturday from Representatives Harold E. Ford and Jim Cooper, both Democrats from Tennessee.
"I think we'll get what we think we have to get on the Democratic side, and I'm working with the Republicans," President Clinton said today as he embarked on another round of meetings and phone calls on the subject.
But the White House lost a potentially powerful ally today when Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, announced that he would vote against the agreement.
Mr. Waxman said he remained unhappy with what he said was a lack of health, environmental and labor protections in the agreement, and he called on the White House to withdraw the legislation and reopen negotiations.
 
'Full Court Press'
 Much of the last-minute lobbying on behalf of the pact has fallen to Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the second-ranking Republican in the House. "I feel like we're in the third overtime of a basketball game and we've been running a full court press," said Mr. Gingrich, who met with Mr. Clinton and the House Republican leader, Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, at the White House on Wednesday to count votes.
Mr. Clinton plans to hold a dinner for undecided lawmakers at the White House on Sunday.
Mr. Clinton sweetened the pot for Republicans today, offering a written promise that he would assail any Democratic challenger who ran against a Republican incumbent because of a vote in favor of the accord. "I'll give it to them in writing," he said. "I'll give it to them in public statements. I do not believe any member of Congress should be defeated for doing what is plainly in the national interest."
 
Debate is Cited
 Mr. Gingrich, like other pact supporters, said they detected momentum toward the agreement, and they attributed it to the fallout from Tuesday night's debate between Ross Perot and Vice President Al Gore, which they said was lost by Mr. Perot, who opposes the accord.
"The Perot collapse the other night took a great deal of the energy out of the opponents," Mr. Gingrich said.
Mr. Perot's lobbying against the accord is continuing. A Dallas-area telephone number for workers in his field organization carries a message that pleads for opponents of the pact to "leave nothing to chance."
"They are spending hundreds of millions of dollars in taxpayer money to buy votes," Mr. Perot says in a message taped this afternoon. "We have to make sure we don't even blink. The meetings that you are holding this weekend while the Congressmen are home will make all the difference.
"You know who the uncommitted are," Mr. Perot continues. "Let's focus on them. Just cover them up with telephone calls."
White House officials stopped short of saying that minds were changed because of the debate, but several said they were satisfied that it had eroded the credibility of the accord's opponents.
Lawmakers who oppose the agreement, which would erase trade barriers with Canada and Mexico, said, however, that they have enough votes to defeat it. The President, they said, must now wrest votes from their base of support if he is to eke out another of his trademark narrow victories on a crucial piece of legislation.
"I'm still very upbeat about this," Mr. Clinton said today. "But I think there'll be, you know, clouds around this issue right until the last."
 
Undecideds Hold the Outcome
 Part of the Administration's uneasiness appeared rooted in its concern about appearing too confident too early, but both sides concede that most of the remaining undecided members of Congress will probably side with the Administration.
"If you're undecided today, we feel pretty good about our chances to have them fall our way by Wednesday," said William Daley, who is running the White House effort to pass the accord.
Representative Lowey, whose district is in the New York City suburb of Westchester County, said she had become convinced that the agreement would spur economic growth.
"If I believed that the Nafta would accelerate these inequities or eliminate jobs, I would vote against it," she said. "The fact is that Nafta will, on balance, make the United States and the New York region more competitive."

HEADLINE: Rise in October Retail Sales Confirms Recovery's Vigor

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 12

 BODY:
Shoppers spent 1.5 percent more in October, the seventh straight gain and the biggest since April, the Census Bureau reported today.
The greater-than-expected advance, which lifted sales to $177.32 billion, was strong confirmation that the economy had gained momentum since late summer. It was also regarded by some as a sign of at least a satisfactory holiday season. 
 "Consumer spending continues to improve," said John E. Silvia, economist for Kemper Financial Services, a unit of the Chicago-based insurer. "For all the popular talk about consumer attitudes being depressed, retail sales are doing just fine."
As further evidence of a seeming disparity between what shoppers say and what they do, the University of Michigan reported today that its mid-November reading of consumer confidence edged down to 82, from 82.7 in late October.
The October retail sales gain was led by the automotive sector but was broadly based, with durable goods -- those meant to last more than three years -- up 2.6 percent and nondurables up eight-tenths of 1 percent.
Yet economists continued to fret because retail spending, which accounts for a third of the economy, is rising faster than incomes, eroding the rate of saving and increasing consumer debt levels.
For now, things look pretty good, said Rosanne M. Cahn, economist at the First Boston Corporation, but "the consumer isn't earning enough income to support these gains." She said she could not say how long heavy spending was likely to last.
Patrick J. Moriarty, a vice president at Bank Julius Baer, concurred, calling earnings gains "mediocre" and evincing concern about the languishing job market. "There's not a lot of reason to expect a big Christmas season," he said.
About 15 percent of the October gain reflected the 4.3-cent rise in the Federal gasoline tax, which took effect at the start of the month, according to one calculation.
Excluding automotive, the October advance was nine-tenths of 1 percent, compared with six-tenths of 1 percent without autos in September, today's report showed. The auto sector thus dragged down total sales in September, which posted an overall rise of just one-tenth of 1 percent, and then swelled the total last month.
These figures are adjusted for recurring seasonal patterns, but analysts cautioned that this process was unreliable during the period of new-model introduction.
Still, it was clear that consumers were spending freely and that cars and rebuilding from Midwest floods were just two of several strengths.
"They were also in the malls, shopping centers and on Main Street," said Tracy Mullin, president of the National Retail Federation. She predicted a minimum 3 percent gain for the holidays from 1992 levels.
Auto dealers' receipts rose 3.6 percent for the month while those for merchants selling building materials, hardware, garden supplies and mobile homes rose 3.5 percent.
The third major durable-goods category -- furniture, home furnishings and equipment -- eased three-tenths of 1 percent after gaining eight-tenths of 1 percent in September.
Among nondurables, sales rose 2.9 percent at gasoline service stations, 1.1 percent at department stores and other places selling general merchandise, eight-tenths of 1 percent at restaurants and bars and seven-tenths of 1 percent at food stores.
Sales fell eight-tenths of 1 percent at drug and proprietary stores and two-tenths of 1 percent at apparel and accessories stores.

HEADLINE: Another Kind of Challenge;
For Many Who Don't Run, the Marathon Still Offers a Serious Contest: Marketing

 BODY:
There has been a lot of talk of finishing times and "hitting the wall." Plenty of people have speculated about the seven-figure turnout of fans.
But who has considered the 30,000 sponges? 
 The New York City Marathon has attracted 26,402 runners and their friends, and they all have had to be fed, entertained and marketed in the frenetic, yet oddly controlled manner at which New York excels.
Just mull the ramifications for the restaurants that emptied their kitchens of tons of pasta this week.
And consider other feeding frenzies. Who will address the annual problem of how to procure a bagel on First Avenue around noon tomorrow, without either being trampled by the well-toned calves of runners or being forced to wait behind the throngs of spectators who cannot decide, once they have reached the counter, between Nova Scotia salmon and lox?
The estimated gain to the city for putting on the product known as the New York City Marathon is $80.9 million. Behind all of the training and sweating there is selling, two-stepping, sweeping and pizza eating.
There are the restaurants, like Cafe Europa on 57th Street, that are offering 24-hour pasta specials. There are the hawkers who have gravitated to the Sheraton New York Hotel, where lots of runners are staying, to hand out fliers for sneaker sales.
 
A Gaggle of Actuaries
 And there is the New York Road Runners Club, the sponsor of the event, which compiled a tome of statistics on the runners so comprehensive that it boggles the mind. (Did you know that there will be 43 actuaries running this year?)
The marathon has drawn runners from every state and 100 countries, and a wee bit of each culture seems to be represented. Renee Gavin, 41, a llama farmer from Bozeman, Mont., who runs a marathon somewhere each year with her sister, trained for this race by jaunting through country roads with her livestock.
"I'm kind of partial to Marmaduke," said Mrs. Gavin, referring to her favorite llama, which is not permitted to run the race and therefore will not take first place in his class, though he apparently runs faster than any human. "He's very athletic and very gentle."
But back to excess. Could Gary Muhrcke, the winner of the first New York City Marathon in 1970, when it was confined to Central Park and offered a first prize of a cheap watch, ever have imagined that the pot for the winning male and female runner would grow to $20,000 and a Mercedes-Benz E320 sedan? (If the winner is an American, he or she will receive a $120,000 bonus.)
And surely Pheidippides, the first marathoner, who crossed the plains of Greece to announce victory over Persia, would be confounded by Borden's Elsie, the self-proclaimed marathon cow who insists on "hoofing" her way from the United Nations to Tavern on the Green during the race.
It's all about progress, really. Consider that last year, Michael Paolillo proposed marriage to Linda Harris on live television at the finish line. This year Tom Young and Pam Kezios will be married on the run, in the middle of the race.
Before the race, the biggest challenge has nothing to do with romance, but rather how to provide enough carbohydrates.
 
Loading Up on Pasta
 "We've done copious amounts of pasta," said Scott Geraghty, the executive chef at the Sheraton. "Runners have a tendency to load up a few days before the race, so we've been offering lots of pasta buffets."
Other preferred treats include bananas (the Sheraton has gone through nearly 500 pounds), bottled water, fruit juices and cereal. "We serve more oatmeal this time of year than we do all year long," Mr. Geraghty said.
When they are not eating, runners are often shopping. The Sheraton set up a maze-like Expo Gift Shop, where those who enter are immediately flanked by women with clipboards, pleased to help browsers select from the plethora of hats, videos, books, official plaques, posters, a block of T-shirts and telephone cards.
Runners are greeted at the door of the Expo with a plastic shopping bag filled with items every runner surely needs: Cracker Jacks, Advil, some fizzy bath cubes, a sample of Tic Tacs and a small can of L'Oreal's light step foam conditioner.
When it is all over, who will take care of the littered scraps of the feasts and the 30,000 discarded sponges used to mop the perspiring runners, as well as the 1.6 million paper cups and 18,000 yards of barricade tape? Browning-Ferris Industries, the waste-management company from Texas, will recycle the cups and plastic water bottles.
The city's Department of Transportation estimates that the event will cost about $30,000 to clean up, not all that large compared to, say, a ticker-tape parade.

HEADLINE: Disavow Attacks on Israelis, Clinton Warns P.L.O. Chief

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 12

 BODY:
Worried about eroding Israeli public support for the accord between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization, President Clinton and Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel called on the P.L.O. chairman, Yasir Arafat, to condemn recent Arab attacks on Jewish settlers, saying he was duty-bound to do so.
President Clinton planned to use the visit of the Israeli Prime Minister to the White House today to highlight a package of economic and military benefits that Washington was offering Israel, in hopes that it would make the Israeli public more comfortable with the notion of trading land for peace with Syria in the near future, and thereby widening the circle of peace. 
 Mr. Clinton promised that the United States would not cut its annual $3 billion in assistance to Israel and that it would help Israel use loan guarantees to finance the cost of Israeli troop withdrawals from Gaza and Jericho. He also said the United States was rewriting American export laws to allow Israel and other countries to buy advanced computers for military uses and that it was ready to sell Israel more military aircraft.
 
Firming Up the Accord
 But in their talks and joint news conference the two leaders dealt as much with how to consolidate the Israel-P.L.O. agreement as with prospects for widening the circle of peace around Israel.
The Israeli Army said today that it had arrested five members of Mr. Arafat's own Fatah organization from the West Bank on charges of involvement in the killing of a Jewish settler on Oct. 29.
"We consider it a great and dangerous violation of the commitment of the P.L.O.," Mr. Rabin said of the Fatah link to the attack. "In the letter that was signed by the chairman of the P.L.O. to me, he committed himself to renounce and reject terrorism. Keeping commitments is the basis for the advancement of peace. We will keep our commitments. We demand then that they keep their commitments, and to come out openly in renouncing and taking the discipline measures" to which Mr. Arafat has committed.
Mr. Clinton also endorsed this view.
"I agree with what the Prime Minister said," Mr. Clinton declared. "I think that Chairman Arafat now, under the terms of the agreement, is duty-bound at a minimum to condemn it. I think we all recognize that he may not have total control over everyone who acts in the name of Fatah, but he is now bound by the terms, the clear terms of the agreement to condemn it."
 
Concern About the Pace
 Mr. Clinton also expressed concern that Mr. Arafat has been slow to set up the economic and security institutions that the P.L.O. requires to begin implementing the agreement with Israel by a Dec. 13 deadline. But the President expressed some understanding for Mr. Arafat's plight, noting that the P.L.O. is not a state, still lacks many basic institutions and therefore is entitled to a certain degree of patience.
"I wish that the pace had been more rapid," Mr. Clinton said, "but I think it is important to recognize that the P.L.O. itself, by its very nature, by the nature of its organization and its activities over the last many, many years, has never had the responsibility of going through the mechanics that have to be discussed in this agreement. You know -- how do the lights get turned on in the morning, how is the food distributed, how are the houses built, how are these things done.
"So I think, in fairness, I would be quite concerned if I thought that the fact that we're a little bit slow in the pace here was the result of some sort of deliberate desire to undermine an accord they had just signed off on. At the present moment, I really believe it is more a function of the whole organization not being organized for or experienced in the work in which they must now engage."
While President Clinton said, "We are working on an agreement to make available a number of planes to the Israelis," Israeli officials said they still have not decided which aircraft they want. They are likely to purchase some top-of-the-line F-15E's, which have the capability to fly from Israel to Iraq or Iran, and some older F-16's being decommissioned by the United States Air Force, officials said.
President Clinton made clear that he was seriously considering Mr. Rabin's request to commute the sentence of Jonathan Pollard, who is serving a life term for spying for Israel. Mr. Pollard, a former civilian intelligence analyst for the Navy, was arrested in 1985 for passing classified information to the Israelis. The intelligence agencies and the Justice Department have been hostile to the idea of commuting the sentence of Mr. Pollard, who was paid thousands of dollars for his services by Israel. But Mr. Clinton left himself a lot of room to maneuver.
"I explained that under our procedure here, I cannot make a decision on the Pollard case until the Justice Department makes a recommendation to me," he said. "Under the U.S. Constitution, I do not have to follow the recommendation of the Justice Department, but under our procedure I have to get one. When I get one, which won't be too long in the future, I will then review it and make a decision."

HEADLINE: Family Doctors Gain a Niche in New York

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
Dr. John Falencki is an anomaly in a city teeming with specialists, where patients see orthopedists for ankle sprains and neurologists for headaches. One of the few physicians in New York City with a full service family practice, Dr. Falencki's patients include 9-day-old infants and 90-year-old great-grandmothers. He does childhood immunizations, Pap smears and minor surgery.
Ten years ago Dr. Falencki would have been seen as a dinosaur doomed to extinction. But today, as health policy experts in Washington have emphasized the need for comprehensive primary care, he and others like him are regarded as a new vanguard. After years of struggling, they have gained new respect and their practices are thriving. 
 "It used to be very hard to work as a family doctor in this town, but the barriers are dropping, since all the hospitals know that they are going to need better primary care," said Dr. Falencki, who opened his practice on lower Fifth Avenue in 1980. "And my experience is that the public is very receptive. People are happy to have a doctor who takes care of all of them, not just their foot or their kidney."
There are only about a dozen board certified family doctors in broad- based private practice in Manhattan, and perhaps slightly over a dozen more in clinics in the borough, said Dr. Neil Calman, president of the Institute for Urban Family Health. But that is more than a decade ago. Although there are no reliable statistics about the number of those board certified family doctors in New York, there are signs that this type of practice is growing and gaining acceptance, both in Manhattan and in the boroughs.
Family physicians have long been popular in rural areas, whose sparse populations cannot support both an internist and a pediatrician, and where specialists are out of the question. Family physicians, whose residencies last three years, are trained in treating adults and children, and can also do small surgical procedures, including delivering babies.
But family physicians have been largely excluded from the cities, where specialists abound and where, until recently, health maintenance organizations would not hire family physicians and hospitals would not give them admitting privileges. When Dr. Falencki came to New York in 1980 after finishing a residency in Seattle, he went into private practice because he could not find a group that would hire him. He said that H.I.P., one New York City H.M.O., told him it promised patients "that their kids will see pediatricians."
That is changing, thanks to the persistence of the few family physicians in New York, as well as the fluctuating demands of the health care marketplace.
"A few trailblazers spent that last decade proving to hospitals that we practice high quality medicine," said Dr. Robert Massad, chief of the new academic department of family medicine at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx. "But more important is that the hospitals are now on a drive for self-preservation. It has become clear that if they want to survive, to fill their beds, they're going to need a lot of primary care physicians. So hospital have had to swallow their objections."
While Dr. Falencki was the only family doctor affiliated with Beth Israel Hospital 10 years ago, today there are 20. And one by one over the last five years, more than a dozen of New York's hospitals have allowed family physicians onto their staffs. It was within the last year that Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan and Einstein established departments of family practice. By next year, both will have active family-practice training programs with the goal of turning out family doctors for urban care.
New York and other urban centers in the Northeast have lagged far behind cities elsewhere in the country in embracing family practice. On the West Coast, even the most prominent academic medical schools, like the University of California at San Francisco and the University of Washington, have strong departments of family practice and turn out many doctors in the field.
Family physicians differ from the old-time general practitioners in their years of specialized training and in the array of services they can provide to patients of all ages. General practitioners, who typically had only one year of training after medical school, usually saw only adults and have no proficiency in some of the new minor surgical procedures that family physicians can do.
The actual number of doctors qualified to practice comprehensive family medicine in New York is difficult to tally, since many of the doctors who describe themselves as "family physicians" in medical directories are not board certified or limit their practice to adults.
Dr. Calman predicted that the family physicians would be crucial to providing health care for the inner city, because they are so self-sufficient and can do many of the procedures that specialists are eager to provide to the well insured. But, he added, a family doctor can also be an attractive option for the middle class and the rich, since families who would usually visit half a dozen doctors to tend to their medical needs could consolidate care with one physician who knows them well.
"This is not just a model of care that works just for poor people or people who live in remote places," Dr. Calman said. "We have people practicing on Fifth Avenue and their offices are mobbed as well."
 
An Inhospitable Environment
 Claire Watson, whose husband and 5-month-old son also see Dr. Falencki and his partner, Dr. Jerry Clements, said: "When doctors are seeing the whole family there's a kind of continuity that really nice. They're generalists in the best sense, trained in all areas, and that's been extremely helpful." She said that the doctors helped manage her recent pregnancy and took care of skin problems that would previously have sent her to a dermatologist.
The dearth of family physicians in New York City has a lot to do with the traditionally inhospitable environment, particularly in Manhattan. Although most of the borough's smaller hospitals, like Beth Israel and St. Luke's-Roosevelt, now allow family doctors on their staffs, its large academic medical centers -- Columbia Presbyterian, New York Hospital, Mount Sinai Medical Center and New York University Medical Center -- do not, although some are reviewing that decision.
What is more, none of Manhattan's medical schools have departments of family practice or residencies in the field. As a result, they have perennially turned out fewer family practice doctors than any others in the country. Last year, Cornell University Medical College had none, New York University had one, Columbia had three and Mount Sinai School of Medicine, six. The Institute for Family Urban Health is aggressively recruiting medical students at Manhattan's medical schools, in the hopes of increasing output.
A few large hospitals in the other boroughs, like Montefiore in the Bronx and Downstate in Brooklyn, have had small family practice programs for more than a decade.
Medical students in New York City say they are dissuaded from entering the field by the lack of role models, leaving them with the feeling that family practice is irrelevant to urban life.
During the last 20 years a few doctors have successfully braved this hostile terrain. Dr. Steve Tamarin practices on West 81st Street in Manhattan, where he sees 2,000 patients. "I feel like a small town doctor on the Upper West Side," he said. "In some families I have four generations under my care."
"It had always been said that you couldn't open a family practice here, that people would prefer a specialist, that you couldn't get hospital privileges, but I always thought it would fly," he said.
Although he initially opened shop on the Upper East Side, he feels his practice is more suited to his current location: "This is a real neighborhood, everyone knows everyone else, and I get many of my referrals through word of mouth."
In addition to routine visits for children and adults, Dr. Tamarin does several office procedures, including skin biopsies; fiber-optic examinations of the colon to detect early cancer, and minor surgery to remove precancerous growths on the cervix.
 
Work With Specialists
 Dr. Tamarin and other family doctors say they offer only those procedures they feel competent to perform, and say they request specialists when they are in over their heads. For example, Dr. Falencki said that while he handles outpatient pediatrics on his own, he sometimes consults pediatricians when young patients are hospitalized.
Advocates for family practice say that family doctors will be crucial to improving health in poor urban neighborhoods,
The Institute for Urban Family Health, which is setting up a family practice residency with Beth Israel Hospital, has already established one at Bronx-Lebanon Medical Center, which has been turning out 10 family doctors a year since 1989.
To encourage graduates to stay in the neighborhood, the institute has set up several small group practices in the south Bronx, where the doctors work for competitive salaries.
The Bronx-Lebanon program, he said, tried to insure that its doctors could provide all the services the community needed. For example, he said, in New York's poorer neighborhoods there is a great shortage of gynecologists to treat women with abnormal Pap smears who are on Medicaid or are uninsured. Abnormal tests must be followed with a procedure called colposcopy in which the doctor takes a closer look at the cervix for signs of cancer and, if that test is abnormal, does minor office surgery to shave off abnormal cells. All of the doctors trained at Bronx-Lebanon can do a colposcopy, he said.
Dr. Calman said that the family practice doctors affiliated with the institute would soon be learning to do abortions, because this simple office procedure can be difficult for poor women to obtain.
"In rural areas there are geographic access problems, but here there are economic access problems or language access problems and the results are the same," Dr. Calman said. "If you have no insurance or don't speak English, you can wait three months in this city to get follow-up for an abnormal Pap test and that's crazy."

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Painful Lessons for Mexican Labor

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PUEBLA, Mexico, Nov. 9

 BODY:
Standing almost in the shadow of Mexico's twin volcanoes, long lines of new Volkswagen Beetles -- remarkably unchanged from those sold in waves in the United States until the 1970's -- give an impression of steadiness and continuity.
But that belies the turmoil that has shaken Volkswagen de Mexico over the last year and may be a precursor to the painful transition that all Mexican businesses are about to undergo, with or without a North American Free Trade Agreement. 
 Last year, VW, which had the most inefficient car plant in Mexico, went through a bitter strike over a new contract, followed by a 43-day lockout that ended with the dismissal of all 15,000 union employees. Most were rehired, but only after they agreed not to press legal actions against the auto maker and to accept Japanese-style work rules and pay scales based on productivity and not seniority.
 In Mexico, the lockout has become a labor watershed because of the way it was handled by Volkswagen and by Mexico's federal Government, which backed VW's hard-line approach by declaring the strike illegal and sending in police officers with shotguns to deter any violence. Union leaders and labor rights experts in the United States have pointed to the strike to explain their opposition to the trade pact, saying it demonstrates that Mexican labor laws do not protect workers and their right to strike.
Volkswagen officials say the dispute stemmed from a split in the leadership of the union, with one side agreeing to make the pay and work rule changes and the other objecting. But no matter how painful or costly, the battle was necessary if the German company was to compete successfully in an open Mexican economy, they said. And they say that where VW has gone, most other companies will someday have to follow.
"We didn't have a very competitive labor contract with our people," said Juan Manuel Rodriguez Jado, who came in as president of Volkswagen de Mexico last spring, eight months after the lockout ended. "Changing that was an unprecedented move, and I think we paid dearly for being the pioneers."
Volkswagen, with the approval of the Government, locked out and then dismissed all assembly-line workers who walked out of the plant and camped outside in protest over the changes in work rules and wage structure. Then, after the Government sided with the company, VW offered to rehire all of those who renounced the dissident union leaders who had led the walkout. Carlos Fernandez de Real, a legal adviser to the dissidents, said 2,000 workers were not rehired because they followed the dissidents.
"The Government was at fault," Mr. Fernandez said. "The workers just wanted to elect their own representatives. You can't do that in Mexico. It was a ferocious repression."
The role of Government in the Volkswagen strike is important, said Huberto Juarez Nunez, a researcher at the Workers University of Mexico, because it shows the weakness of Mexican labor laws and the degree to which unions here are apt to side with management, under pressure from the Government, over the interest of their members. Mexican officials saw Volkswagen as a crucial step in the transformation of the auto industry, and they sent a clear message to workers at other plants about accepting Japanese-style work rules.
Once the new rules were in place, the start-up was rocky and months passed before the factory managed to build a car that it could ship.
 
 
Bad Time for a Strike
 During the 43-day lockout, VW may have lost as much as $2 million a day. Worse is that the strike came just as VW was preparing to build its first new Golf and Jetta designs in several years, cars that it hoped would lift its flagging share of the United States market. By the time workers finally returned, they not only had to learn how to build the new models, but how to work in the newly formed teams.
That delayed delivery of the cars for nine months, leaving long-suffering VW dealers in the United States with little to sell.
Having slid from strength to near disappearance in the crucial United States automotive market, Volkswagen has hitched its hopes for recovery to the 28-year-old plant in Puebla, about 80 miles southeast of Mexico City. Until August, when Brazil resumed limited production, Puebla was the only plant in the world still producing the Beetle. The factory also produces redesigned Golfs and Jettas, small stylish cars that are sold around the world.
Joaquin Vasquez, 34, has worked at the plant for 10 years. He lives in Puebla, as do most of the 14,000 VW workers. He has worked many jobs on the assembly line, but now he is part of a team that assembles a large part of the dashboards of Jettas.
"The changes are good, I think, but they could have come a bit more slowly," he said. "It's hard for some of us to adjust."
The team concept is a direct result of last year's labor problems. In a country where unions have a great deal of political clout, VW's independent union was among the largest and most powerful. As last year's contract was being negotiated, most workers thought the big struggle would be over wages. A 35-hour strike at the beginning of July 1992 helped to bring wages up 20 percent, to an average of $15 a day, among the highest in Mexico.
But the new contract restructured the way work would be done. VW wanted to join the most advanced auto companies, who are following Japanese lean-production systems. Workers would do more than one job and would work in teams.
Company executives say they held meetings, some lasting more than 18 hours, with 182 union delegates to negotiate the work rule changes. But a group of union members, including officials who had lost control of the union a few months before, asserted that provisions calling for the rule changes had been kept secret from the rank and file.
Hence, thousands of workers refused to work and staged a sit-down protest outside in July 1992, just a few days after the new contract had been signed. VW officials contended that since the union had already signed a contract, the strike was illegal. Moreover, they said, it was really a conflict between the two union factions.
"It looked like a bunker," said Mr. Juarez Nunez, who taught at the University of Puebla during the strike.
 Mr. Rodriguez, the VW president, says he thinks the plant is more efficient and the quality of the cars is improving. VW says that if the free-trade agreement is approved, it will be able to meet a content requirement of 62.5 percent North American parts, because more than 55 percent of the value of its parts purchases now come from the United States, Canada or Mexico.
Mr. Rodriguez, who worked for VW in Argentina and Spain before coming to Mexico, called the strike "an old and painful story" that he would rather not dwell on.
This past summer, a contract was negotiated under the new work rules. Workers received productivity bonuses and there was no violence.
Fausto Lara Paisano, a union leader, said the last year had been among the most difficult of his 14 years at Volkswagen. "But tensions are starting to disappear," Mr. Lara said. "The workers have a little more confidence now because the biggest changes have already been made and they start to see that everything maybe can turn out all right."

HEADLINE: THE FREE TRADE ACCORD;
Little Voices Roar in the Chorus of Trade-Pact Foes

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 12

 BODY:
President Clinton has been going after Big Labor for orchestrating a campaign against the North American Free Trade Agreement.
But Big Labor, meaning the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s bureaucracy in Washington and most of the 33 union presidents who lead it, is the least of his problems. 
 For all its lobbying, petition drives and $3.2 million in billboard and radio advertising, the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations maintains that it is the people in the hinterlands -- and, interestingly, many of them in nonunion jobs -- who are driving the effort. Among loose, grass-root coalitions of workers, farmers, small-business people, the clergy, civil rights groups and environmentalists, the trade agreement is stirring local passions as never before.
For example, nonunion garment workers in Georgia are putting pressure on Representative George Darden, a Democrat, to oppose the trade pact. Other Congress members are facing similar pressure from farmers and business people in Minnesota and from citrus and vegetable growers in Florida. In San Francisco, where most garment workers are nonunion, they have joined union members and even some contractors to defeat the accord.
 
A 'Bottom Up' Issue
 "This is one of those issues that is bottom up," said Mark Anderson, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s director of trade affairs. From thousands of local unions, he said he had been swamped with requests for information about the pact. "We have probably sent out more material on Nafta than on any other issue, ever," he said.
Jose Alvarez, political director of the 143,000-member Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union, said: "The nerve center is the American people. American men and women see the Government in one scheme after another that gets rid of their jobs."
To the extent that the drive against the trade accord is being orchestrated, one leader is the agreement's chief opponent in Congress, Representative David E. Bonior, the Michigan Democrat who is the majority whip. Grass-root opponents mainly rely on him for head counts in Congress. Another is the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s biggest union, the 1.3 million-member International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which has far out-pamphleted and out-demonstrated all other unions.
But the main coordinator of the effort is a tiny lobby here, the Citizens Trade Campaign, which operates out of a one-room office with a staff of six and a budget of $400,000 this year. Of its 41 supporting organizations, 13 are labor unions
 
Other Foes of Pact
 Among the other chief opponents are United We Stand America group, the political party formed by Ross Perot; the Sierra Club; Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth; the National Farmers Union; the National Council of Senior Citizens; Ralph Nader's Public Citizen; Jerry Brown's We the People, and Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition. Some of these groups, like retirees and small farmers, have credibility among Republican legislators, which the A.F.L.-C.I.O. lacks.
But it is the Citizens Trade Campaign, with offices in 47 states, that has been doing much of the organizing. State and regional captains, most on loan from citizen groups, are organizing parades, speeches and visits to legislators' home offices. Jim Jontz, the director of the campaign, an Indiana Democrat who is a former House member, says most of his work involves advising local campaigns and providing speakers for demonstrations.
"We are not the A.F.L., and they are not us," he said. "Our campaign is the base of the Democratic Party. People see this very much about whether they're going to have control over their communities or leave it to corporate board rooms."
Frank Jackalone of Public Citizen, who has been leading the drive against the pact with groups in six Southern states, said the region's economy had blossomed with the relocation of Northern and Midwestern industries. But he said workers now saw the agreement as likely to hasten the exodus of those industries to Mexico.
In recent years, Mr. Alvarez said, workers have seen cut-and-sew apparel companies move to Mexico. "Pack a sewing machine in a box and you move a factory," he said. He said the trade accord would give industry confidence to invest heavily in high technology there.
Because unions have organized little of the Southern textile industry, some members of Congress there say they are rarely lobbied by labor leaders. But they see plenty of the new coalitions.
"The opposition, and the workers who are in greatest peril in my district, apparel and textile workers, are nonunion," said Mr. Darden, a Democrat from Marietta, Ga., who said he was leaning against the agreement. "It seems quite spontaneous."
In Minnesota, a strong union state, Representative David Minge, a Democrat, had heard many other voices before deciding a few days ago to oppose the agreement. He received a petition, signed by 33 farmers and business people, from Bud's Place, a cafe in the village of Gluek. "We would like you to vote 'no' on Nafta," it said. "We do not believe selling our rural America is the proper thing to do."
Mr. Minge said, "That kind of response was important to me."
Mr. Minge also heard from the Minnesota Fair Trade Coalition, the local branch of Mr. Jontz's group. "All our effort was focused on Minge for a couple of months," said Larry Weiss, the local captain.
Republican fence-sitters are also hearing from local opponents. For instance, Representative Dan Miller of Sarasota, Fla., said he had been contacted most by citrus and vegetable farmers in his predominantly agricultural district. "Perot got 23 percent of the vote in my district," Mr. Miller said of the Presidential race last year. "There are not a lot of people who feel strongly in favor of Nafta. There are a lot who feel strongly opposed."
Within the labor movement, the campaign against the accord extends far beyond the industrial unions that have been most directly affected by jobs' moving to Mexico. "Our self-interest is very similar," said Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of Teachers. When factories close, he said, community tax revenues plunge, so teachers lose wages and jobs.
 
Drive to Oust Backers
 Local union leaders and their nonunion allies, and not just Mr. Perot, are threatening to purge Congress of members who support the agreement.
Dominic Chan is an organizer for the West Coast garment workers and a member of the coalition opposing the pact. Only 1,600 of the San Francisco Bay area's 20,000 garment workers are union members, but they and even some garment companies that cannot afford to move have joined Mr. Chan in fighting the accord.
In next year's Congressional elections, he said, the workers will try to oust legislators who favor the accord. One is Mr. Chan's representative in Congress, Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat. "We're going to oppose her," he said. "We're going to find a serious candidate to run against her."
John P. Morris, who leads 140,000 workers as the top teamsters official in Pennsylvania, a highly unionized state, said he would support whoever ran against legislators who favored the accord. "We will take up a collection to get that Congressman a ticket on a bus to Mexico," he said.
To be sure, most top union officials plan to make peace, regardless of how next week's vote on the pact turns out, so they and the Administration can work together on issues like health care. "We disagree on this single issue, and that's it," Thomas R. Donahue, the federation's secretary-treasurer, told a news conference Wednesday.
But pass or fail, other opponents of the agreement say, the struggle is likely to cast a long political shadow.
Every time a factory departs for Mexico, Mr. Jackalone said, "Clinton is going to get hell."

HEADLINE: Good Retail Sales Data Help Dow Climb 22.08

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
Propelled by another report of good economic news, the stock market bounded ahead yesterday in a rally led by issues that have foundered for much of the year.
Investors flocked to forest-products, tobacco and other cyclical stocks, whose earnings are sensitive to the pace of the recovery. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 22.08 points, to 3,684.51 in heavy trading, bolstered by Philip Morris, up 2 1/2, to 59 1/4;, International Paper, up 1 1/2, to 65 7/8, and Woolworth, up 1, to 22 1/8. For the week, the Dow rose 41.08 points.
The Dow Jones transportation average, which has broken several records in the last month, hit another high. It shot up 17.09 points, to 1,752.07, surpassing its closing of 1,742.24 set on Nov. 1. Its standouts included UAL, up 1 5/8, to 148 3/8; AMR, up 1 1/4, to 71, and Burlington Northern, up 1 1/2, to 56 1/2.
The market got a jolt of energy yesterday after the Government reported that retail spending rose 1.5 percent in October. Moreover, the National Association of Realtors said housing demand was growing because of low mortgage rates. The announcements were interpreted by many investors as a sign of a strengthening economy.
And the bond market, which has slumped in recent weeks in response to good economic news, held steady, propping up stock prices. Some analysts have noted in recent weeks that rising bond yields might encourage some investors to switch to fixed-rate securities from stocks.
"If this stock market is to continue making new highs, then it has to be led by the cyclicals," said John H. Shaughnessy, a senior vice president at Advest Inc. "We are beyond the stage where this market is going to be driven by the prospect of lower interest rates. We are into the second phase, the earnings- and dividend-driven phase."
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 326.2 million shares, up from 287.1 million shares on Thursday. Advancing issues led declining issues by about 3 to 2.
Among the broad indicators, the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 2.75 points, to 465.39. The American Stock Exchange composite index increased 1.62 points, to 479.60. And the Nasdaq composite index edged up 0.34 point, to 779.32.
The Dow Jones utilities average, which had slumped to a 10-month low on Thursday, rebounded slightly yesterday, closing up 0.98 point, to 224.95.
A report that shipments for linerboard products grew in October and recommendations from several analysts helped paper stocks, which have suffered for much of the year.
Besides International Paper, Federal Paper Board rose 1, to 23 3/8; Temple-Inland shot up 4 3/8, to 50 1/8; Stone Container increased 1 3/8, to 10 1/8; Weyerhaeuser was up 1, to 44 3/8, and Georgia-Pacific surged 3 5/8, to 73 7/8.
Tobacco stocks continued their hot streak after Philip Morris and American Brands told distributors that they were raising prices about 4 cents a pack. Besides Philip Morris, RJR Nabisco edged up 1/8, to 7; American Brands shot up 1, to 35 3/8, and UST rose 1 1/2 to 27 1/2.
Among other issues, Dreyfus rose 3 5/8, to 46 1/4 after it was upgraded by Oppenheimer & Company. Takeover rumors have swirled around Dreyfus in recent days. Caterpillar fell 1 1/8, to 89 1/4, after thousands of its workers in two states walked off the job, angered by the suspension of a union representative.
In Nasdaq trading, Vital Signs plunged 6 1/2, to 13 3/4, after Prudential Securities reduced its recommendation on the stock. And Boston Chicken, the most successful initial public offering in years, continued its slide, falling 2 1/4, to 39 3/4. When the stock began trading on Tuesday, it promptly skyrocketed to 48 1/2, more than double its initial offering price of $20 a share.
In Tokyo, Japanese stocks rose yesterday, rebounding from the sharp declines of the last two weeks. The Nikkei average of 225 issues gained 335.03 points, or 1.85 percent, to close at 18,493.55.

HEADLINE: Bonds Rebound From Early Selloff

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The Treasury bond market rebounded strongly yesterday, recovering from an early selloff set off by the Government's report of a surge in October retail sales.
By the end of the day, the price of the Treasury's 30-year bond jumped 23/32 of a point, while its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, tumbled to 6.15 percent, from 6.20 percent on Wednesday. 
 The bond market was closed Thursday for Veterans Day.
In early trading, bond prices had fallen as much as 20/32 after the Commerce Department reported that retail sales rose 1.5 percent in October, the biggest gain in six months. The surge was led by the automotive sector but was broad-based.
Analysts said the Government report had initially raised concern that economic growth could aggravate inflation pressures, which can reduce the value of bonds. But the market reversed course after buyers emerged to take advantage of the cheaper bond prices. In addition, analysts said that many investors had taken a second look at the retail report and decided it was not so bearish for bonds after all.
 
Higher Prices in the Picture
 Marilyn Schaja, money market economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities, said that much of the 1.5 percent increase in retail receipts resulted from higher consumer prices, not greater sales.
For example, sales soared 2.9 percent at gasoline stations, but a large part of that was a 4.3-cent-a-gallon increase in the Federal excise tax on gasoline, which took effect Oct. 1.
Also contributing to skepticism about the economy's strength was a University of Michigan consumer confidence survey; that index fell to 82.0, from 82.7 in October, according to financial market participants who saw the results.
But there was doubt that the bond market could sustain its upward trend after its dramatic plunge of recent weeks, touched off by worries that the long-running bull market was nearing an end.
"I don't think we've now gone into a renewed bull market by any means," said Alan Levenson, money market economist at the UBS Securities unit of Union Bank of Switzerland. "I don't know if today's action tells us anything."
Prices of short-term Treasuries were 3/32 to 5/32 of a point higher, while intermediate maturities rose 9/32to 10/32 of a point. The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, rose 3.01, to 1,311.36.
The discount rates on Treasury bills slipped. The rate on three-month bills fell one basis point, or hundredth of a percentage point, to 3.09 percent. The discount rate on six-month bills dropped three basis points, to 3.22 percent, and the rate on one-year bills fell one basis point, to 3.37 percent.
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds closed at 102 11/32 , up 2/32 from late Wednesday. The average yield to maturity was unchanged at 5.60 percent.

HEADLINE: Housing Resale Prices Rose in 3d Quarter

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 12

 BODY:
Demand spurred by low mortgage rates drove up prices of previously owned homes in the third quarter, particularly in smaller inland parts of the nation.
The National Association of Realtors said today that "second tier" markets were thriving in much of the West, Midwest and South from July through September, compared with the similar period of 1992. 
 The median price jumped 6 percent in the South, to $97,400, and 5.2 percent in the Midwest, to $85,700. Both regions were hurt less and recovered earlier from the recession.
California, whose economy remains depressed, limited the overall appreciation in the West, which posted a 1 percent loss despite double-digit gains in some areas. The median price in the region was $143,100.
Prices in the Northeast, which has been slow to recover, slumped 2.2 percent, to $140,400.
"Sales of less-expensive homes have been the big force behind many markets," said the association's president, William S. Chee. "Over the past quarter, the lower-priced segment of the market has continued to draw the most buyers."
Mr. Chee said the lowest mortgage rates in two decades had increased demand in the lower price ranges, by allowing more first-time buyers to enter the market.
The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation has reported that mortgages averaged 6.91 percent last month.

Oil Prices Retreat as Traders Discount Talk of Cutbacks

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
Crude oil prices retreated yesterday, giving back half of Thursday's gains, as traders dismissed speculation that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries might be preparing to reduce its output.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for December delivery fell 18 cents, to $16.72. December heating oil dropped 0.17 cent, to 51.61 cents a gallon, and December unleaded gasoline lost 0.94 cent, to 45.37 cents a gallon, its lowest in five years. 
 "Nothing has changed" in the downward trend of oil prices, which have fallen more than 10 percent in a month, said Tom Bentz of Quantum Financial in New York.
But prices jumped more than 2 percent on Thursday amid speculation that Saudi Arabia, OPEC's largest producer, would push for a production cutback at the group's next meeting, on Nov. 23. OPEC's production ceiling, set at 24.52 million barrels a day in September, is too high, traders said.
A senior official at Saudi Aramco in Riyadh called production cutback reports "rumors and speculation."
OPEC produces about 37 percent of the world's oil supply. Rising non-OPEC output and weaker-than-expected demand have sent prices down. In addition, Iraq is to begin talks with the United Nations Monday about ending economic sanctions against it, including the oil embargo. Iraq's return to the market could add 1.5 million barrels a day to already glutted markets, traders said.
On other commodity markets, coffee prices fell sharply for the second session. Traders are disappointed that Brazil, the world's largest coffee producer, has bought only 10 percent of the coffee it agreed to buy in an effort to push up prices.
On the New York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, coffee for December delivery dropped 2.10 cents, to 72.90 cents a pound, its lowest in a month.
Brazil agreed in September to participate in a plan to retain 20 percent of its own coffee exports in warehouses until prices rose above 75 cents a pound but is not buying enough, said Judy Ganes, an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Slips Despite Report Of a Pickup in Retail Sales

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar fell yesterday, slipping to a four-week low against the Japanese yen, as traders shrugged off positive economic news and focused on next week's uncertain Congressional vote on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The dollar usually gets support from signs of an improving American economy, but a Commerce Department report showing the strongest pickup in retail sales in six months failed to push up the currency. 
 "Traders are not that confident about holding positions ahead of Nafta," Carlo Ceresa, foreign exchange manager at Credit Commerciale de France, said of the House vote scheduled for Wednesday. "As we get nearer, it will affect positions more and more."
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said yesterday that the Administration was within 10 votes of the 218 needed in the House. But the pact faces strong opposition in Congress and from organized labor.
In late New York trading, the dollar fell to 105.65 yen, from 106.40 on Thursday. It also dropped to 1.6845 German marks from 1.6931.
 
Dealers Still Bullish
 Gold prices also fell. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for December delivery lost $2.80, to $373.60 an ounce.
Despite the dollar's weaker tone, dealers still maintain bullish forecasts for it, given recent signs of economic growth. Some said it had to retrace before heading higher.
"We're definitely seeing improvement on the economic front," a New York bank dealer said. "But if the dollar's going to get to 1.75 marks, we're going to have to see more of a retracement to build a base beneath."
Furthermore, some dealers expect the Bank of Japan to support the dollar if it falls much further because a weaker dollar would hurt Japanese exporters.
The British pound closed in New York at $1.4937, up from $1.4760 late Thursday.
Other late dollar rates, compared with Thursday's quotes, included: 1.4870 Swiss francs, down from 1.4980; 5.8650 French francs, down from 5.9000; 1,652 Italian lire, down from 1,657, and $1.3133 (Canadian), down from $1.3152.

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
Employee Pension Plans Can Suffer From Neglect

BYLINE: By Francis Flaherty

 BODY:
WHEN R. Theodore Benna happened upon an obscure paragraph in the tax code 13 years ago, he made a discovery that would drastically alter pension planning in America.
"I had no idea" how big it would become, Mr. Benna, then a little-known benefits consultant in Bucks County, Pa., said in a recent interview. His discovery -- section 401(k) -- led to a type of pension plan that has since attracted hundreds of billions of dollars in employee retirement savings. By the year 2000, these worker-financed plans -- the fastest-growing of defined-contribution pensions -- will be America's "largest source of personal wealth," Mr. Benna predicts. 
 But 401(k)'s have an image problem. As the millions of employees who get memos on the subject this fall will vouch, the plans are boring.
Investing can be full of excitement, from the nail-biting of an initial stock offer to the dropped jaws of market-roiling news from abroad. But 401(k)'s -- basic investments, regularly made, for, yawn, retirement -- are about as sexy as their name. If they were food, they'd be potatoes; if they were shoes, they'd be sensible.
What's more, the plans need some getting used to. Take employees. Instead of just collecting the monthly checks issued under traditional defined-benefit pensions, workers must decide if and how much to contribute to these plans and then select and monitor the investments.
For some, it's an unaccustomed role -- and it shows.
A plan's investing options might include a money market fund, a bond fund and a stock fund. But a 1993 survey by John Hancock Financial Services found that almost half of 401(k) participants thought money market funds contained stocks and bonds. Only a quarter knew that declining interest rates signaled the best time to buy bond funds.
These false impressions surface as bad investment choices. More than half of the plans' assets are in conservative investments -- like money markets or guaranteed investment contracts -- that may not grow fast enough to support a retirement, Mr. Benna said.
But the really bad news is that only 17 million of the 24 million workers eligible for the plans participate.
"They're by far the best deals out there," said W. Boyd Griffin, president of Retirement Advisors Inc., a Hearst Corporation venture. Besides deferring taxes on both contributions and earnings until retirement, most plan participants can get matching funds from their employers. "The most common match is 50 cents on the dollar up to 3 percent of annual income," Mr. Griffin said.
Thus, even if a worker opts for an investment yielding 3 percent, matching may lift his first-year's "return" to a whopping 54.5 percent, counting interest on the match.
Even when they do participate, "people aren't putting in enough," Mr. Benna said. Although some restrictions apply to salaries above about $64,000, many workers can contribute about 15 percent of annual income up to a maximum this year of $8,994. The average annual contribution is 4 percent of income.
Of course, some people cannot afford to contribute; indeed, participation rates rise sharply with income. In many companies, workers can rely on traditional pensions, profit-sharing and other programs. In estimating their retirement needs, workers should count all income sources.
Employers also have new roles to play in the 401(k) world, and some, like their employees, are stumbling. (Most companies have been deft, however, in grasping the worker-financing aspect of the plans.)
With 401(k)'s, a company must decide what options to offer and must select a bank, insurer, broker or mutual fund company to run the plan and furnish the investment vehicles.
"Early on, a lot of plans didn't have many investment choices, and they had high fees, paid either by the participants or by the employer," said Kurt Brouwer, president of Brouwer & Janachowski, investment advisers in San Francisco. "Some companies just had a C.D. at their local bank."
Employees should scrutinize their plan's fees and investment options. They should check out the plan manager's resources, too; many large ones offer 401(k) newsletters, like Fidelity's Stages and Scudder's focus.
If employees don't like the company plan, "they should tell their human resources people," Mr. Benna said. Many employers may be responsive. Under voluntary Labor Department guidelines effective in January, companies can gain some liability protection for poorly performing investments if their plans satisfy rules on the number and variety of investing options, periods when employees can switch investments and so on.
Employees should also ask their companies to look into the latest wrinkle in 401(k) education: independent advice. Commonly, the institution that manages the assets also designs the plan and educates the employees. When the purveyor of the investments is also the plan designer and educator, "the fox may be watching the chicken coop," Mr. Griffin said.
Last August, such suspicions led Mr. Griffin to introduce 401(k) Dimensions, a quarterly newsletter sold to employers for distribution to employees. Standard & Poor's also publishes an independent newsletter, Your Financial Future, which goes to 500,000 people.
Perhaps to atone for all the confusion he has caused, Mr. Benna recently started the 401(k) Association forplan participants. The annual $35 fee buys a retirement-planning workbook, the S.& P newsletter and other resources. (800) 320-401K
Most important, don't procrastinate. Read the pile of 401(k) memos consigned to the far corner of the desk. Like cleaning out the closet or shining one's shoes, dealing with Mr. Benna's discovery is boring -- but increasingly necessary.

The Short-Run America

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER

 BODY:
The bleak side of capitalism is the ruin it leaves behind after, having worked its magic, it moves on. Backers of the North American Free Trade Agreement are naturally reluctant to dwell on this gritty historical fact, yet there is something cruel, offensive and faintly dishonest in their argument that any pain felt by the working classes will be only a "short-run" experience.
The argument comes easily to people with the financial security required to live in the "long run." Corporate America and the Washington establishment, both ardent for this agreement, consist of people who can afford to wait for the year of Jubilee. 
 For working stiffs, however, life is lived in the "short run." The rent is due at the end of the month, the grocery money every Friday. Politicians, tycoons and media stars exhorting such people to ponder the comforts to come in the "long run" can only sound like hypocrites or visitors from another planet.
The truth most likely is that the agreement will indeed bring benefits in the long run to something called "society," which will include the comfortable people now hot for free trade. History, both modern and antique, suggests that it will also bring a great deal of ruin to the people who now fear losing their jobs.
Besides trying to sell the empty notion that everything will work out in a long run that is meaningless to many working people, advocates of the agreement should also be thinking of ways to deal with some of the ruin inescapable for short-run people.
An unpleasant characteristic of capitalism is the ruination it periodically creates: ruined landscapes, ruined societies, ruined people. Since capitalism is the national dish, we ought to be aware of this dark side of its nature so we can be ready to soften its nastiest results as it rollicks from place to place, first doling out money prodigiously, then suddenly skipping town and leaving a wasteland behind.
In this fashion it made England rich with the Industrial Revolution and introduced a century of human misery. In America it has left ruined New England mill towns, a "rust belt" of ruined steel towns, ruined railroad towns from one end of the continent to the other and, most recently with more to come, ruined auto towns like Flint, Mich.
Mining has left the ruined landscapes of West Virginia and Kentucky, the real-estate boom has left the ruined farmlands of the lush Piedmont, the miraculous chemical industry has left ruined flora and fauna, and the auto industry has left a ruined sky and a junkyard ruin in every other town in America.
State capitalism is now showing that it too can turn boom to ruin. For details, see Joan Didion's recent New Yorker article about the ruin of the California town that lived high and fat until military-spending cuts shut off the Pentagon's money to McDonnell Douglas that had made it boom.
The problems created when capitalism visits these periodic ruins upon us include despair, anger, misery, hatreds, social upheaval and the rise of new political ideas, some dangerously crackpot, others as dangerously intellectual as Karl Marx's Communism, one result of the ruins of the industrial revolution.
Some sort of dangerous economic disturbance is obviously in progress. American labor is being priced out of jobs by East Asian workers who will do the same work for less. American retailers now fill their racks with low-priced clothing made by sweated child labor in South Asia.
Even more alarming is the recent trend in industry's extensive firings: first, blue-collar workers, then white-collar people, then lower-level technicians, and now middle- and upper- management people. Some say this is the work of the computer, which enables industry to keep production high while drastically cutting employment.
In brief, the people who say it's a new world and we'd better face it quickly have a point. Unfortunately, they are not being honest about the price many people will have to pay. In this computerized world they don't even talk much about maybe retraining old-timers who are potential losers to use computers. This isn't surprising; our schools don't even prepare many young people to qualify for employment in this new cybernetic America.

Mexican Mine Interest On the Block

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON

 BODY:
Asarco Inc., a major American mining company, said yesterday that it expected to be able to sell a portion of its stake in Grupo Mexico, one of the largest mining and mineral producers in the world, when that company joined the ranks of at least 30 other Mexican concerns whose shares are now traded on United States exchanges.
The Mexican concern, whose full name is Grupo Industrial Minera Mexico, S.A. de C.V., plans an international offering in the near future, although the company and Asarco executives declined to specify on what exchange the shares would be traded. At present, Grupo Mexico shares are only traded on Mexico's stock exchange, the Bolsa. 
 Asarco closed yesterday at $20.50 a share, up $1.25 in light trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Grupo Mexico's international offering will take place after Grupo Mexico absorbs a privately held subsidiary, known as Medimsa, which comprises all of Grupo Mexico's assets. Medimsa is now 28 percent owned by Asarco, based in New York. Asarco's book value for the interest in Medimsa is about $300 million.
 
Asarco to Own a 23% Share
 After the merger, Asarco will own 23 percent, or about 158.7 million shares, of Grupo Mexico's total 690 million shares outstanding, said Gerald F. Corbett, an Asarco spokesman.
Asarco declined to say how much of its Grupo Mexico stake it might sell.
Recently, metal prices have been depressed as consumption has declined during the worldwide recession. Some analysts expect slight increases in demand for metals in 1994.
Asarco has had Mexican mining interests since its founding in 1899. But Asarco has lost money during the four previous quarters and its Mexican mines have not paid a dividend since 1988, Mr. Corbett of Asarco said.
"They've had an illiquid investment for a while," said Wayne Atwell, a metals analyst for Morgan Stanley. Medimsa's copper mine near the Arizona border needs millions of dollars in investment to improve its efficiency, he said. Asarco "didn't want to put the cash in."
 
Chairman Voices Optimism
 In an interview, Richard de J. Osborne, Asarco's chairman, said he expected that Asarco's remaining stake would rise in value since Grupo Mexico would be able to tap other sources of capital and perhaps retire some of its $1 billion in debt.
Medimsa is Mexico's largest mining company and last year produced 242,000 tons of minerals such as copper, lead, zinc, silver, gold and molybdenum. Its two copper mines, which were purchased from the Mexican Government since 1988, have substantial reserves.
Last year, Grupo Mexico had earnings of $123 million on sales of $905 million.
Ten of Mexico's stocks trade as American depository receipts on the New York Stock Exchange, including Telefonos de Mexico , the Mexican phone company. An additional 20 companies' shares are traded over the counter, according to the Mexico Investment Board.

HEADLINE: THE IMPACT: The Elderly;
Those With Large Bills See Aid in Clinton Plan

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
Millions of older Americans share the problem of paying for expensive prescription drugs and long-term care at home. The Clinton health care plan includes three broad provisions that are likely to be special boons for them.
*It would create a prescription drug benefit, under which those eligible for Medicare would pay an extra $8 a month, and in return the Government would pay for most of their medications, after a $250 deductible. 
 *It would provide some money for long-term home care for disabled people who need help with daily tasks like eating, dressing and bathing, or for those with serious mental impairments.
*It would assure health insurance for those who retire early, and do not become eligible for Medicare until they turn 65.
"People's first reaction to this plan may be confusion or being overwhelmed, but once they sort through it, they're going to see that it's got some substantial benefits," said John Rother, the legislative director of the American Association of Retired Persons.
It is no accident that the Clinton Administration, desperate to win the allegiance of the elderly -- and the powerful advocacy groups that represent them -- has produced a plan that should appeal to older people.
The new drug benefit would be a great help to people like Howard Rosenzweig, 77, who, considering his diabetes, his heart condition and other medical problems, spends more than $200 a month on medications. As he says, the rising cost of prescription drugs, coupled with the low interest rates his savings now yield, have changed his retirement from comfortable to constricted.
"I had to give up going out for dinner so I could pay for my medication," said Mr. Rosenzweig, a retired New York City garment worker. "I think, Is it food or is it medication?"
 
Vague on Long-Term Care
 The Clinton proposal's long-term care sections are not as well defined as the prescription drug benefit. Indeed, there are no specifics about how much help the Government would provide to people with physical disabilities or to those with severe retardation or dementing illnesses like Alzheimer's disease.
What the plan does say is that under a new long-term care program, the Federal Government will provide money for some home-based care and other non-institutional care for people who need help with three of the five basic tasks of eating, dressing, bathing, going to the toilet and getting out of bed, and for those with severe mental impairments.
But many experts say that, given budget restraints, it is unlikely that significant long-term care benefits can be provided to all who need them. And the plan makes only a nod to perhaps the thorniest problem of long-term care: the high price of nursing-home care.
Because few families can afford nursing-home costs -- which can exceed $50,000 a year -- many Americans in need of care but unable to pay now find themselves in the difficult position of having to impoverish themselves to qualify for Medicaid. The Clinton health plan would allow people to keep $12,000 of assets -- instead of the current $2,000 -- and still qualify for Medicaid. And nursing-home residents on Medicaid could keep $100 of their monthly Social Security checks as a living allowance, instead of the current $30.
 
Early Retirees' Insurance
 The Clinton plan does tackle a problem that plagues employers and older workers alike: health insurance for early retirees. Most Americans retire in their early 60's, but they are not eligible for Medicare until they turn 65. Many lose their health insurance when they retire, or find they must pay high premiums for minimal coverage.
"I retired last year when I was 59," said Sandy Warshaw, who worked as a manager in New York City's government. "I had thought of moving to Boston, where my grandchild is, or to Arizona, where it's warmer, but decided I shouldn't because of insurance. Under my insurance from the city, I pay $10 each time I see one of the preferred doctors, and those doctors are all around here." Under the Clinton plan, which offers universal, fully portable coverage, Ms. Warshaw could go wherever she wants without losing insurance benefits.
The plan guarantees anyone who retires between 55 and 65 access to comprehensive health insurance at a community-wide price through the new regional health care alliances, once they are set up. Beginning in 1998, the Government would pay 80 percent of the premiums for all but the most affluent early retirees.
Over all, the Clinton plan envisions a day when most older Americans would be covered through the same regional health alliances as younger workers, instead of through Medicare. Once the plan is in effect, people turning 65 would be allowed to choose either Medicare or insurance through an alliance.

HEADLINE: If The French Can Do It, Why Can't We?

BYLINE: By Steven Greenhouse; Steven Greenhouse, a reporter in the Times Washington bureau, was a correspondent in the Paris bureau for five years.

 BODY:
Pascal Favre-Rochex is in the midst of that morning tightrope walk parents know so well -- settling his son in preschool. His knees are scrunched up against the pint-size table as he hams it up, reading "Monsieur Rigolo" to 3-year-old Clement. A moment later he gives his son a hug and is out the door. The teacher, Maryse Corne, invites Clement, Antoine, Ines, Mehdi, Stanislas and 16 other toddlers to sit on the gray rug at her feet. First they recite rhymes about escargots and bumblebees, and then they sing "Frere Jacques," pumping their right arms up and down to ring imaginary church bells.
By French standards it's just another day in preschool. But through American eyes what's going on in this Parisian preschool is extraordinary. This class is part of a free, full-day, public preschool, or ecole maternelle. Many New Yorkers, Washingtonians and Californians pay $8,000 to $14,000 a year to send a child to preschool or a day-care center, if they are lucky enough to find a place. In France, 99 percent of 3- 4- and 5-year-olds attend preschool at no or minimal charge. 
 In sharp contrast, just one-third of American 3- and 4-year-olds attend preschools or day-care centers, and in many communities the nonaffluent need not apply. But with the strong backing of left and right, the French spend $7 billion a year to make sure every child -- rich, middle class or poor -- gets off to a good start. They feel the benefits outweigh the cost.
Comparing the French system with the American system -- if that word can be used to describe a jigsaw puzzle missing half its pieces -- is like comparing a vintage bottle of Chateau Margaux with a $4 bottle of American wine. The first child-care centers were built in the early 1800's to protect the children of women who took jobs in rapidly industrializing Paris. But it was only after World War II that the system exploded in size as the battle-scarred nation sought to protect its young from starvation and disease. Today, for France's 4.5 million children under the age of 6, the constellation of child-care offerings is vast and all of them are linked to health care. The three major categories are day-care centers and day-care homes, for children 3 months to 3 years of age, and preschools, for children 2 1/2 to 5 years old. Day-care centers, or creches, and day-care homes charge fees on a sliding scale. Public preschools, or ecoles maternelles, are free; parochial preschools are heavily subsidized.
"Our objective is to be both a place of learning and a place that stimulates children," says Josiane Mattei, the director of the preschool Clement attends, off Avenue du General Leclerc. Mattei coordinates the curriculum for 210 children and, since this is France, sees to it that the children use proper table manners.
"We don't want parents to feel that they're leaving their kids at a baggage claim," she says.
Preschools run from 8:30 A.M. to 4:30 P.M.; parents can pay $300 a year for wraparound programs that provide supervised activities from 7:30 to 8:30 A.M. and 4:30 to 6 P.M.
Local government supports the day-care centers, which are normally open from 7 A.M. to 7 P.M. The overall cost of sending a child to a Parisian day-care center is $10,000 a year. Poor families pay $390 per year, middle-class families pay about $3,200, and the rich pay $5,300. When we lived in France, our son, Jeremy, attended a creche in the Latin Quarter. The fee was $3,850 a year.
The staff of 19 was responsible for 72 children. The director, Odile Caplier, is a registered nurse who spent two years studying child development. Like all municipal creche directors, she has an apartment in the same building, enabling her to keep a child past 7 P.M. in an emergency. The staff includes a deputy director (also a registered nurse) and two teachers (each with the equivalent of four years of college). The 12 child-care aides are high-school graduates who have taken a one-year course in child development.
What wowed my wife, Miriam, was the food. She often mailed copies of the creche's weekly menu to friends in the United States so they could salivate over the poached fish, cauliflower mousse, parsleyed potatoes and Camembert cheese -- not bad compared with the peanut butter sandwiches served at so many American preschools.
Concluding that our daughter, Emily, would do better in a more intimate situation, we sent her not to a day-care center but to a day-care home. France has 30,000 such homes -- what amounts to a network of full-time government-licensed baby sitters who look after 57,000 children under the age of 3. Baby sitters must pass medical and psychological exams, and their homes are inspected for safety.
Once a month, Daniele Naudin, the matronly director of a municipal day-care center in western Paris, goes on her rounds. She pushes open the door of a turn-of-the-century brown brick building, walks up two flights of stairs and presses the doorbell of one of the eight baby sitters under her supervision.
"Bonjour, Mme. Naudin," Malika Akdim says, as she opens the door to her apartment, where she is looking after two girls, 11 months and 19 months old.
Naudin organizes monthly training sessions for the baby sitters, teaching them how to cope with emergencies, keep children clean and prepare healthful meals. One morning a week, the baby sitters take their charges to the center, where they play with other children and are examined by doctors.
Eager to encourage baby sitters to work within the system instead of in an off-the-books limbo, the French are trying to make the job more respectable and lucrative. Akdim, who emigrated from Morocco 15 years ago, has three school-age children and earns about $1,000 a month as a baby sitter. The local government provides bedding, bottles, toys and strollers for the children she cares for. The national Government has created an incentive for parents to use licensed sitters by refunding the Social Security taxes they pay (about $800 a year). Just imagine the grief this would have saved Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood.
France also offers parent-run day-care cooperatives and short-term drop-in programs. Municipalities put up money to build the cooperatives and provide a child development specialist to work with parents. Government-run "garderies," which are akin to indoor playgrounds, offer a few hours' respite for parents. Paris is experimenting with a center for children in "difficult" family situations that provides special care night and day supervised by a psychologist and social worker. Called Enfant Present, it works with the court system and social service agencies.
Small wonder that many American educators and child-care experts -- including Hillary Rodham Clinton -- have looked to France as a model. Four years ago, as chairwoman of the Children's Defense Fund, she was one of 14 American experts who took part in a study of French child care sponsored by the French-American Foundation. "We found that most programs in France looked as good as the best American programs," says Gail Richardson, director of the foundation study. "What you see for everybody in France is what you see for just a small percentage of people in the United States."
French child care is not perfect, Richardson concedes. Though the ratio of children to teachers in French preschools, sometimes more than 25 to 1, is high by American standards, it is offset by the use of teachers' aides and by extensive teacher training. Most French preschool teachers have the equivalent of a master's degree. But don't expect the First Lady to make a big push for a French-style system anytime soon. The simple reason is cost.
Even if the White House were to unfurl a grand plan for child care, Federal, state and local governments would no doubt squabble over how to finance and control it. American and French taxpayers' attitudes toward spending on social services are very different. Almost half of France's gross domestic product goes to taxes, compared with less than a third in the United States. Even after the conservatives ousted the Socialists in the April elections, and amid signs of growing worry about France's budget deficit and high payroll taxes, the French are clamoring for more, not less, spending on child care.
In Paris over the last decade, creche enrollment has doubled to 22,000. But in some neighborhoods, there still aren't enough places for all the children that need them. And in this year of deep recession throughout France, local officials say they are feeling intense pressure to hold down the cost to the taxpayer. The solution: continue building day-care centers while charging parents, especially the rich ones, more.
During the 70's, most middle-class and rich French parents preferred to use nannies. But attitudes changed radically after research demonstrated that socialization is important and that children who had been in creches and ecoles maternelles did better in the first years of elementary school.
"Nowadays, most parents want collective care, which is exactly the opposite of 20 years ago," says Sylvie Rayna, a researcher for the Ministry of National Education. "Now, everybody seems to be demanding a place at a creche."

HEADLINE: Moment of Decision For Health Care

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

 BODY:
IT was only two or three years ago that the phrase "job-lock" began to appear in public discourse. The ugly new term described an ugly new condition faced by millions of people: fear of leaving or switching jobs out of a well-founded concern that health coverage, once given up, might not be regained because of price, "pre-existing conditions" or other factors.
Now less than three weeks after President Clinton's 240,000-word proposal for health care was placed before Congress, now as months of intensive debate begin amid a chorus of hope about the goals and a cacophony of warnings about the details, it is easy to forget the serious underlying problems -- spreading job-lock being symptomatic of them -- that led to calls for drastic change on the scale of the New Deal or the Great Society. For his part, Mr. Clinton was moved to gamble his own place in history on an issue that had been a nonstarter for many Presidents before. 
 Now the President and Hillary Rodham Clinton, his chief torchbearer on health care, are doing their best to remind everyone of the costs to individuals and the economy of inaction. Thus their mantralike descriptions of a health-care system that's "badly broken," their endless promises of "security" and of "comprehensive benefits that can never be taken away."
If there is no consensus on how to fix things, there is wide agreement that two intertwined problems -- an erosion of health insurance and a rocketing of medical costs -- are jeopardizing the security of families and the economic health of the country.
Some 37 million Americans, mainly the working poor, live without the basic peace of mind offered by health insurance. Every other industrial country provides something close to universal coverage and the ever-growing number of uninsured Americans has long been seen by medical experts as an index of national shame.
Still, it was not a sudden rise in compassion for the poor that suddenly thrust health care to the top of the national agenda. Increasingly, middle-class Americans have tasted the fear, degradation and risk of financial catastrophe that come with a lack of health insurance. As costs soar, insurers have found more ways to discriminate among customers, excluding those most likely to run up large bills, and to avoid or pile huge charges onto individuals and small groups that cannot spread expenses among large numbers of payers. Tearing away further at the insurance net are changes in the job market, including increased layoffs and the spread of part-time work and jobs without benefits.
The number of the uninsured at any point in time, in some ways obscures the real problem. A little more than half have been without insurance for more than a year. But the rest are part of a constantly changing mix of people who spend anxious months without coverage before regaining it through employment, qualifying for government programs or other means. In an era when the bill for an afternoon's visit to a specialist, including tests, can reach $1,000 and outpatient surgery can cost $15,000, the fear is palpable.
Federal experts estimate that over the next two years close to one in four Americans will spend time uninsured. Thus the White House has sought to redefine the debate, focusing as much on the insecurity of the currently covered as on the plight of the chronically deprived.
"All these trends add up to a growing sense of unease: 'Yes, I'm insured today but will I be tomorrow?' " says Henry Aaron, an economist at the Brookings Institution.
At the same time, many economists say, runaway medical costs have eroded wages and threatened the competitiveness of American industry. Certainly they threaten the solvency of the Federal Government.
This year, about 14 percent of the gross national product will be devoted to health care, one dollar in every seven. By comparison, no other country devotes more than 10 percent of its economy to health. By the year 2000, according to Federal projections that assume no radical policy changes, health spending would reach 19 percent of the economy. And by that year, the Medicare program for the elderly and the Medicaid program for the poor would eat up an astounding 23 percent of the entire Federal budget, dooming any hopes of taming the deficit.
If it were just a question of guaranteeing universal coverage the country would face a relatively simple task. But assuring coverage cannot, alas, be considered apart from the vastly more complex and divisive question of cost control. Continued inflation would not only fling ever more people into the ranks of the uninsured, but also drive the costs of any subsidy scheme through the roof.
Mrs. Clinton said the goal is "to preserve what is right and works about the American health care system, but, finally, to fix what is wrong." But there is no agreement yet on how to reshape American medicine in a way that will prune out waste while preserving quality care, on how to bring discipline to the sprawling "medical-industrial complex" without stifling innovation.
And so now the country, with a set of sweeping proposals on the table, must decide just how badly broken the system is after all, and what price it is willing to pay to fix it.
The Clintons wanted "a great national discussion." That they have. Whether the issues can now be engaged in an understandable way, whether members of the public can connect their own preferences with practical alternatives, whether Congress and the President can clarify the choices and pass a coherent plan -- all are the stiff questions facing American democracy.

HEADLINE: Growing Consensus on Covering All, but How?

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER

 BODY:
PRESIDENT CLINTON and Hillary Rodham Clinton have won the first battle of health care, with hardly any notice of how important the victory was. Business, labor, consumer groups, the elderly, doctors, nurses and hospitals, the insurance industry and even many once-reluctant members of Congress have come together on a central issue as never before. They agree that the nation needs universal health care coverage.
This success has gone largely uncelebrated, mainly because the perils of the long march ahead allow no indulgent, if deserved, respite for self-congratulation. Reconstructing the way Americans relate to doctors, hospitals and insurers is the most profound social task Congress has undertaken since the 1964 Civil Rights Act, and it is being mounted without the same national sense of moral command that underlay that law. 
 But the commitment of the major players to universal coverage is a monumental first step. Since last year's campaign, the Clintons have focused and crystallized the public's anxiety about the rising costs of health care, and especially its fear of suddenly losing insurance. Of the President's campaign promises, that was the one that mattered intensely to voters in 1992. His willingness to stake his Presidency on the issue has transformed the question of whether to have a national health care program to what program would be best.
Still, there is no certainty that the Clintons' formidable weapons of tenacity and eloquence can convert the apparent consensus over universal coverage into agreement on his proposal, or, more realistically, on some combination of his proposal and other competing plans.
These are the problems:
*The issue is complicated, and the Clinton solution, on which debate focuses, hardly matches his claim of simplicity.
*Congress has jurisdictional and partisan divisions that often tie it up, and the central issue of requiring employers to pay insurance premiums is one that could bring on paralysis.
*The organizations that have coalesced behind universal coverage have seemed to move quickly beyond that point and now spend more energy demanding a better break for themselves than advocating the idea generally.
*The public's commitment is general, rather than precise.
*Disputes over how to deal with abortion could fragment Democratic supporters.
On the other hand, here are the reasons more lawmakers expect action than foresee stalemate:
*As House Speaker Thomas S. Foley describes the mood in Congress, "Clearly, there is a virtual consensus that we need to reform the health care system." He said, "There are hardly any voices who say 'This is not broken, don't fix it.' '
*The rank-and-file agreement is buttressed by the evident desire of such senior committee chairmen as Senator Edward M. Kennedy and Representatives John D. Dingell and Dan Rostenkowski to crown their careers with this achievement.
*About half the Senate Republicans, having abandoned their filibuster mode of last spring, plainly want to see major changes enacted.
*The Clinton Administration has come up with one of the best political slogans in years, "Health care that's always there," and an equally snappy visual gimmick, the red, white and blue health security card; both are important devices for public persuasion.
The plan they are selling would revolutionize the financing and delivery of health care in the United States. The plan spelled out in the 1,342-page bill submitted to Congress last month would try to insure that every legal resident of the United States has health insurance and try to curb rising health-care costs.
Most employers would be required to pay the bulk of their workers' insurance premiums, with small business heavily subsidized. No employer would have to pay more than 7.9 percent of payroll. The self-employed would be required to insure themselves. The Government would cover the poor, now treated through Medicaid, and the unemployed, so that workers would no longer be, in the Clintons' phrase, "only a pink slip away" from losing their insurance.
States are likely to have considerable latitude in managing the system. But except in a few states that might choose a "single-payer" system where the Government pays the bills, the actual insurance would be provided by insurance companies. They would have to offer a broad standard package of benefits set by Congress and adjusted by a National Health Board, including doctors' and hospitals' bills and prescription drugs, and would compete in ways of delivering it, such as through a Health Maintenance Organization or a more expensive, traditional fee-for-service plan.
To connect insurers and consumers, states would create insurance purchasing alliances representing hundreds of thousands of people. The alliances would use large-scale bargaining power to negotiate the lowest possible rates from companies, and then send consumers comparative information on prices, ways of providing service, and quality ratings -- from customer waiting time to immunization rates. Consumers would choose among plans annually, although some plans might become "full" and closed to new patients.
Companies with more than 5,000 employees could choose to self-insure their employees if it would save them money, but would have to offer them the standard national benefits package.
The elderly would continue to be covered by Medicare, but would be given a new benefit of prescription drug coverage and inclusion in another new program for long-term care in homes and communities, but not in nursing homes. The new benefits would be paid for, in rough balance, by cuts in the expected growth of Medicare and Medicaid.
Over all, three-fourths of the health care dollars would come from the same sources they do now, from individual and employer payments. Subsidies for small business and the poor would come from other Federal savings and from about $100 billion in cigarette taxes and taxes on big employers that do not join alliances.
Besides the savings it envisions from greater competition among insurers, the Administration's hopes for controlling costs rest on restrictions on insurance-premium increases.
The biggest questions raised about the plan relate to its complexity, its cost controls, the overall financing and the requirement that employers pay premiums.
The President argues, with good reason, that nothing could be as complicated as the existing system. But descriptions of his plan, especially of how the alliances would work, have left lawmakers baffled. Thomas Mann, a political scientist at the Brookings Institution, says, "The belief that it's too complicated is seeping through."
The insurance premium limits are sharply criticized by Republicans who say price controls are not only wrong but do not work. Republicans like Senator John Chafee of Rhode Island would rely much more heavily on competition and restructuring the insurance industry for savings.
The doubts about the financing of the system run in two streams, one Congressional and one administrative. Many outsiders, and many lawmakers, too, doubt that Congress can muster the courage to impose the proposed Medicare and Medicaid cuts and avoid the pressures for more coverage -- from more frequent mammograms to more generous mental health benefits to greater small business subsidies. Meanwhile small-business owners wonder whether those subsidies will outlive a future round of budget cuts.
But even lawmakers who don't share those reservations recall how much the costs of Medicare exceeded the expectations, and doubt that anyone, even with the best intentions and the ablest computer programmers, can foretell the expense of a vast new Federal program. And no one thinks the estimates will be low.
When the Clintons delivered their bill to Congress last month, they had reshaped the financing to try to answer those doubts. It plans to lay aside enough money to provide a 15 percent "cushion" above cost estimates it says are already conservative, in order to provide a reserve fund if costs spurt beyond the estimates. The President defines his plan as a "capped entitlement." That means that if health-care costs outrun the money made available to pay for them plus the 15 percent, Congress will have to cut health benefits, cut other programs or vote to raise more money, presumably by raising taxes. Other entitlements, like Social Security, expend whatever funds the law calls for, whether they go over budget estimates or not.
The clearest dispute is over the requirement that employers pay premiums for their workers. Mrs. Clinton told the House Education and Labor Committee that since most employers now pay for insurance, this is the least disruptive way to approach universal care. But most Republicans, and many Democrats, fear that such a rule would kill off small businesses.
Senator Chafee would try to get everyone covered by requiring individuals to buy insurance. But that approach has a political problem of its own: the specter of the Internal Revenue Service. He said recently that to enforce the mandate on individuals, "you will have to show on your tax return that you have health insurance." Enforceability, in other words, is a key difficulty here.
The Clinton program was put together over several months of closed-door brainstorming led by Mrs. Clinton and Ira C. Magaziner, the President's top health policy aide. It was assembled through painstaking negotiation with all kinds of organizations. Small business was promised subsidies. Big business was assured that the Government would pick up its share of insurance for early retirees. The elderly were told their prescriptions would be included. There was more tinkering after a draft of the program was shown to Congress in mid-September.
But the result has not been altogether satisfying for the Administration. Some groups sound like Rickey Henderson, the baseball player who signed a rich contract and then pouted for years after other players were paid more. While the Administration may have had no realistic alternative, when a program is offered like candy, some children worry that the next kid is getting more. The President's deal-making to get his bill passed only invites organizations to keep asking for more.
After a public relations triumph with the plan's initial selling by the President and the First Lady, the Administration has been disappointed in its hope of leading a popular bandwagon of support. Many groups whose backing it hoped for, like the National Association of Manufacturers and the American Association of Retired Persons, have focused on the negatives.
"It's a lot easier for a critic to get an attractive sound bite, a catchy phrase," observed Bill Kovach, curator of Harvard University's Nieman Foundation for journalism. But he said newspapers and magazines had failed, too: "One of the trends in journalism is to emphasize the negative aspects of public debate on any issue."
The view of the public is somewhat favorable -- though not by large margins -- but people are not in general confident of their knowledge of the proposal. A CBS News Poll in October showed that 37 percent thought the plan would make health care better, and 26 percent said it would make it worse. But only 18 percent, down from 23 percent soon after Mr. Clinton's speech and his wife's testimony, said they thought they had a "good understanding" of it.
The Administrartion has a lot of work ahead before that understanding goes much higher, as effective as the "health care that's always there" slogan. On Sept. 22, Mr. Clinton cited six principles by which to judge the program: security, simplicity (which took the most words), savings, choice, quality and responsibility.
But there is no equally effective three- to five-minute explanation to solidify support and to translate interest into real and essential commitment.
The President cannot, certainly, afford to rely solely on unions, who are now fighting with him over the North American Free Trade Agreement, or the American Association of Retired Persons or any other single special-interest group. He knows he has to build the same kind of broad consensus for enacting his plan as he built for the belief in the need for it. Former Gov. Richard F. Celeste of Ohio is in charge of that, traveling the country trying to create state and local organizations to keep the pressure on.
But this will not be easy. Congress will probably not even begin voting in committees until late winter or early spring. Jurisdictional rivalries, especially in the House, could delay action further. Many Republicans and conservative Democrats seem committed to fighting hard against the plan. The Administration must deal with them without angering liberal supporters of a national "single-payer" system -- a group of five Senators and 89 representatives who want, at the least, to make sure the system is generous enough to those in the greatest need and is truly universal.
Effective dates, and almost anything with a number in it, may change.
But universality is probably the only truly non-negotiable issue for the Clintons. As Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader, said recently, universality "clearly is seen by a lot of people, including a lot of Southerners, as the kind of inner glue to the whole proposal."
Senator Kennedy, who has been pushing for national health care for most of his 30 years in Congress, spoke with relief about the consensus on universal coverage. But, he said: "We can't afford to miss this once-in-a-generation opportunity to achieve health security for all Americans." And he observed, "If we can't do this, people will wonder why have a Congress at all."
It will not be easy, nor without moments when all seems lost. But the odds are that before the voters get to pose that question at the polls a year from now, Congress will have passed a bill that somehow reaches the goal of universal coverage.

HEADLINE: THE IMPACT: The Consumers;
More Choices, but Also More Costs

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

 BODY:
The heart of the Clinton strategy for holding down medical spending is to make people aware of the true cost of their health care. And that may be jarring for many who receive generous benefits at work.
In the structure outlined by the White House, many people may find themselves choosing among unfamiliar new health plans and accepting new limits on their freedom to choose doctors or hospitals, or paying extra to use the system as freely as they are accustomed to. 
 The question remains whether the lower-cost health maintenance organizations into which many people might be pushed will offer long lines and second-class medical care, as some critics fear, or efficient, prudent, top-flight care, as officials predict.
 
How Much for Coverage?
 Under the Clinton proposal, everyone would be required to have health insurance and to contribute to its cost. All companies would be required to contribute for workers and their families, with the employers paying 80 percent of the cost of premiums and workers 20 percent.
Officials estimate that the average premium in 1994 would be $1,932 a year for individuals and $4,360 for families; so an employee would pay an average of $388 for individual coverage and $872 for family coverage. The self-employed and unemployed would be responsible for the entire amount, but depending on income, could be eligible for subsidies.
Individuals and most companies would no longer directly buy their own health insurance. Instead they would sign up with large cooperatives, or regional health alliances, which would present their members with a choice of health plans that have the same basic set of benefits. These plans would be made up of groups of doctors and hospitals, often organized by insurers.
A company employing at least 5,000 people could function as its own alliance or join the regional alliance.
The proposal envisions three basic kinds of plans. They are:
*"Low cost-sharing" plans, H.M.O.'s in which patients pay $10 per office visit to affiliated doctors.
*"High cost-sharing" plans, which allow patients to visit any doctors and health centers on a fee-for-service basis, but require families to pay a deductible of $400 and 20 percent of all subsequent bills, to a maximum of $3,000 per family per year.
*"Combination" plans in which patients pay little to use affiliated doctors and more to use others.
In more populated areas, an alliance might offer several plans with varying premiums. Any patient could choose any plan; the idea is to force plans to compete for customers by offering the best price and quality.
In turn, financial incentives would be used to nudge more people into the most cost-effective H.M.O.'s. Through stiffer deductibles and co-payments consumers would pay heavily for the ability to choose any doctor -- an amount, officials say, that fairly represents the extra cost of unmanaged care.
Thus, while many Americans might be able to choose more generous plans that cost them little more than they have paid in the past, others might find themselves spending more to keep the same freedoms.
 
The Choices
 One of the hottest issues raised by the proposal is freedom to choose one's doctor. Critics attack the plan as restricting choice, while the White House says it will be opening more choices. Both are right.
More than 41 million Americans are already in H.M.O.'s. But to the extent that more people feel pushed into them, they will face new limits. These groups usually allow a choice of primary physician among affiliated doctors, but patients must go through this "gatekeeper" to visit specialists, who must also be in the group.
Critics raise the specter of chronically ill patients ripped from a trusted doctor. This might happen, but the chances would be reduced if virtually all doctors sign up with health plans, as the proposal envisages.
Administration officials also point out that large numbers of Americans do not now enjoy the hallowed freedom of choice. Some 37 million are uninsured and the 30 million people on Medicaid, the program for the poor, often have trouble finding decent care.
Health maintenance organizations save money not only by negotiating lower fees with doctors, hospitals and other suppliers but also by scrutinizing medical decisions and discouraging wasteful, costly services. At best, this could produce fine care and weed out useless and harmful procedures. At worst, doctors' groups and H.M.O.'s could be tempted to scrimp on costly but useful care, jeopardizing health, and on personnel and equipment, producing long waits.
Administration officials say their proposal would insure high-quality care. As they make their annual selection of health plans, consumers would vote with their feet, shunning plans that perform poorly. A national program would develop ways to measure the quality of care offered by health plans. But critics question how consumers can adequately compare medical performance.

HEADLINE: THE IMPACT: The Providers;
Reshaping the Medical Marketplace

BYLINE: By PETER KERR

 BODY:
If the health care proposals of the Clinton Administration become law, they would throw into fast forward trends that are already reshaping the fates of doctors, hospitals and the insurance companies that pay them.
Doctors would win a victory that leading medical organizations like the American Medical Association have long sought: guaranteed insurance coverage for tens of millions of the uninsured. 
 But physicians would find that under the plan they would have even less autonomy than they do now. The market could be expected to force doctors to find patients by signing up with health care networks run by insurance companies and health maintenance organizations. Even when they treat patients who are not members of such networks, they would be required to charge them according to a schedule of fees approved by regulators for every service, the type of arrangement that has applied to Medicare and Medicaid.
The impact of the plan would probably be just as great on the hospital industry. As hospitals and treatment centers are drawn into managed care networks, they, too, would be put under growing pressure to cut costs. Experts say the Clinton program would probably speed the pace at which such institutions are already shutting down wards, merging with other hospitals or closing their doors.
 
The Big Five
 In addition, the plan says teaching hospitals would be forced to stop turning out so many highly paid specialists and to redirect their efforts to training lower-paid, primary-care physicians. And the plan is expected to bring changes in the medical marketplace that would force a significant number of specialists to retrain.
Some of the most drastic changes, however, would be seen in the health insurance industry. Most of the nation's 500 or so health insurers are expected to be driven out of the field, and among the likely beneficiaries would be the five giants of industry -- Prudential, Cigna, Aetna, Travelers and Metropolitan Life -- as well as the more than than 70 Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans.
The Clinton plan offers a bit of relief to insurance companies that sell workers' compensation and automobile insurance. The plan would merge the $40 billion in medical coverage now offered by workers' compensation and automobile policies into standard health care plans. But it assures property-casualty insurance companies that now sell such coverage that they will be allowed to stay in those lines of business by providing coverage through the alliances.
What ties together the future of all sorts of medical providers, doctors, hospitals, health maintenance organizations, pharmacies and laboratories, is the requirement under the Clinton plan that Americans receive their health coverage through the yet-to-be-created purchasing groups.
These health alliances, region by region, perhaps metropolitan area by metropolitan area, would tell insurers and health maintenance organizations what minimum requirements they must meet before they would be allowed to offer coverage to the public.
By assuring that all Americans have complete medical insurance coverage, the Government is guaranteeing that millions more patients and tens of billions more dollars will flow into doctors' offices. In addition, by permitting the 30 million people who are now covered by Medicaid to be covered by the alliances, the Clinton Administration would create legions of patients who are suddenly more lucrative to treat.
But the plan also spells out major constraints on doctors. The plan says insurers may still offer the current type of insurance that lets doctors bill patients for each procedure performed. Since such plans are expected to be the most expensive, however, planners say the majority of consumers will choose managed care plans. As a result, doctors searching for patients will find themselves joining managed care plans as well.
Such plans vary greatly, but one common element for doctors is that they have to agree to work under the rules of an insurance company or a health maintenance organization that closely supervises how much care and what kind of procedures should be given.
In addition, they are often paid by a system designed to motivate doctors to think twice before they go ahead with expensive and time-consuming procedures.
Under this "capitation" system, an insurer might offer a doctor a fixed fee for treating 100 patients. If the patients need less care than the average for such a group, the doctor makes more profit, but if the group needs more care than the average the expense comes from the doctor's pocket.
Doctors may decide to join such networks, but executives at some large health insurance companies say that over time, they expect more and more doctors to affiliate with one network or another.
In some specialized fields that have many practitioners in a given area, like hematologists in New York City, there may not be enough spaces in networks for all the doctors. The result may be that many such highly trained doctors will have to retrain in a lower-paying field of primary-care medicine.
Much of the nation's hospital industry has already been shaken in the past five years by the need to get rid of excess beds and lower their costs. As hospitals, too, find that they have to affiliate with managed care networks, the process will certainly speed up.
Another section of the report suggests a five-year phase-in period in which academic hospitals would try to decrease the number of specialists they train.
For the nation's $300 billion health insurance industry the future is one of transformation. The vast majority of the hundreds of health insurance companies in the United States offer the old-fashioned fee-for-service plans. Those plans are already losing customers to managed care networks, and under the alliance system, economists say, most would have to leave the business entirely.
What would remain, health economists predict, would be a limited number of H.M.O.'s, insurance health plans and similar networks run by doctors and hospitals.
The largest health insurance companies that have invested heavily in managed care networks say they hope to move swiftly to reduce costs. One executive said his company's goal was to reduce its work force.

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S HEALTH PLAN;
A New Framework for Health Care

 BODY:
To control medical costs and provide secure coverage to all, President Clinton has proposed a vast restructuring of the health care system, to be phased in over several years. The proposal would use financial incentives to encourage consumers to join low-cost health maintenance organizations, and would push doctors, hospitals and insurers to join toether in networks. The strategy is to make consumers conscious of the ture cost of their care and, by fostering competition among plans, to force the plans to cut costs and offer better service. If competition does not drive down costs, mandatory ceilings on the growth of insurance premiums would aim to keep total spending in line with the growth of the economy.
 
THE OVERSEER
 
A seven-member National Health Board, appointed by the President, would monitor state compliance and the functioning of health alliances, interpret the standard benefit package and make recommendations about new benefits to reflect changing technology and needs, and set regional medical spending ceilings. It would develop indicators ofthe quality of service and care offered by health plans and publicize the results to promote informed consumer choices. A committee would monitor drug prices, raising questions to the pharmaceutical companies about those drugs it deems unreasonably expensive.
 
THE PAYERS
 
Employers: Would pay the bulk of the cost. The plan requires them to pay at least 80 percent of the average cost of premiums in thier region, and to support family coverage for married workers.
 
Employee: Would contribute an average of 20 percent toward their own insurance premiums, plus any required deductibles or co-payments.
 
Self-Employed and Nonworkers: Would be required to buy insurance, paying the full cost of premiums, unless they qualify for government subsidies. The cost would be fully tax deductible. Currently only 25 percent of the cost is tax deductible.
 
Government: Would subsidize costs for many small and low-wage businesses and for individuals (like part-time workers and the unemployed) who have incomes below 150 percent of the poverty line. Medicare payments would continue for the elderly and disabled. Medicaid would continue to pay for the poor, but through health alliances.
 
Large Corporations: Would have the option to negotiate directly with insurers for their employees' coverage, but would still be required to pay at least 80 percent of employees' premiums.
 
THE BROKERS
 
Health Alliances: The core of the plan. Run by the states under Federal scrutiny, these regional purchasing groups would collect and distribute premiums, certify health plans and offer them to consumers, insure that average premiums grow no faster than Federally set limits, collect and publish data on performance of health plans and negotiate with local doctors and hospitals to set fees for services provided outside H.M.O.'s
 
Access: All citizens and legal resident would be covered.
 
Cost: Alliances would determine a target range for average premiums charged by plans in its area. Plans would not be eligible if their charges were higher than the range.
 
Eligible Plans: Alliances would write a contract with any plan that met state requirements.
 
Options: Alliances would offer a range of medical plans of three types: an H.M.O., a fee-for-service plan, or a combination of the two. Patients could not be turned away unless a plan is overshubscribed.
 
Quality: Allance would publich information to help consumers compare the service and the medical perfomance of various plans.
 
Size: Alliance size would be based on population, so the number of alliances in each state would vary.
 
Structure: Alliance structure would be determined by states. Could function as nonprofit corporations or state agencies, but consumers and employers would have to be equally represented in the management of the alliance
 
Corporate Alliances: If these employers decided to negotiate directly with insurers and form their won alliances, they would still have to offer the guaranteed benefits package and a choice of plans, though their employees might have fewer providers to choose from.
 
THE OPTIONS
 
Most alliances would offer a large selection of plans, but all must include at least one fee-for-service options offering free choice of doctors. The administration estimates that the average plan cost would be $1,932 a year for an individual and $4,360 for a family, but costs would vary by region. Plans of any type would vary in price; people choosing costlier ones would pay a higher share of premiums. Plans could offer supplemental policies, covering items like extra dental or mental health benefits; employers could choose to pay for these or consumers could buy them with after-tax dollars.
 
H.M.O.: The least-expensive option. Patients sign up with a health maintenance organization and only consult doctors affiliated with that organization. Subsribers typically pay only $10 for an office visit. If they visit a doctor outside the plan, they pay a share of the bill.
 
Combination Plan: The middle option. Patients sign up with a group for most of their care, but reserve the right to consult outside doctors by paying 20 percent of the fee for those visits.
 
Fee For Service: The most expensive option, offering the widest choice of doctors. Patients can see any doctor they choose, but must pay deductibles ($200 for an individual and $400 for a family) and 20 percent of the cost of office visits and hospitalization, up to a limit of $1,500 for an individual and $3,000 for a family.
 
THE BENEFITS
 
All Americans would be issued a "health security card" that would enable them to receive the guaranteed benefits listed below.
 
Dental: Most care for children. Adult preventive benefits phased in by 2000.
 
Drugs: Prescriptions
 
Eye & Ear: Routing vision and hearing examinations; eyeglasses for children only.
 
Extended Care: Nursing homes or rehabilitation centers (as an alternative to hospital stays). Maximum of 100 days each year.
 
Home Care: As an alternative to hospitalization; re-evaluated every 60 days.
 
Hospice Care: For terminally-ill people.
 
Hospital Stays: Semi-private room; private rooms only when medically necessary.
 
Mental Health: Limited psychotherapy; limited inpatient services and psychiatric hospital stays.
 
Office Visits: Professional services, emergency care and other outpatient hospital services; laboratory tests and ambulance.
 
Medical Equipment: Braces, artificial limbs or prosthetic devices, when equipment improves functional abilities or prevents futher deterioration.
 
Outpatient Therapy: Physical, occupational or speech therapy to restore skills lost from illness or injury. Re-evaluated every 60 days.
 
Preventive care: Immunizations, mammograms, Pap smears, prenatal care and cholesterol screening.
 
Substance Abuse: Limited outpatient and inpatient services.
 
The plan excludes services that are not "medically necessary or appropraite," citing cosmetic orthodontia, hearing aids, contact lenses, sex-change surgery and in-vitro fertilization as examples of such services.
 
 
 
A Consumer's Guide: How Different Groups Would Be Affected

 
IF YOUR SITUATION IS...
 
Working, with Good Insurance: Many employees would see little difference, especially if they have already joined an H.M.O., and some would have more plans to choose from. Workers opting for free choice of doctors would often pay more up front toward premiums and have higher costs as theyreceived care. Companies would be required to pay 80 percent of average premium costs, but could pay more if they wished. If currently offered, company-sponsored benefits behond those in the standard package remian tax-free to employee for 10 years.
 
Working, Uninsured: Employers would be required to contribute and employees would be required to purchase coverage, paying 20 percent of the cost if they chose an average-priced premium, less if they chose a cheaper one. Workers would receive a subsidy toward their share, on a sliding scale, it family income is below 150 percent of the poverty line. The poverty line in 1992 was $14,340 for a family of four; 150 percent of that is $21,500.)
 
Non-Worker or Unemployed: Those with little income would pay little to keep full coverage; those with uneraned family income would contribute on a sliding scale, paying full cost if income exceeds 250 percent of the poverty line.
 
Part-Time Worker: Employers would contribute toward premiums for those working from 10 hours to 30 hours a week on a prorated basis. Depending on total family income from all sources and eligibility for subsidies, workers pay the remainder. In general, those who have purchased individual policies in the past would benefit from cheaper large-group rates.
 
Self-Employed: Self-employed individuals would pay under a complex formula that treats them like a small business, potentially eligible for subsidies, and an employee. As contribtuion toward the employer share - 80 percent of average premium cost - they would pay from 3.5 percent to a maximum of 7.9 percent of business income, depending on income level. They would also pay employee's 20 percent share, or less if family income was below 150 percent of poverty. Combined payments would approach full cost of premium at income of about $30,000. All premium payments would be tax deductible, compared with 25 percent now.
 
Two-Earner Family: In most cases entire family would sign up for same plan, but spouses may be allowed to join different ones. Each of the two employers would contribute toward each earner, but the two earners together would not pay more than the normal family share - 20 percent of the cost if they chose an average-priced premium. Whether most families would pay more or less than now depends on many factors.
 
Household Employee: For those working more than 10 hours a week and considered an employee by Social Security, employer would make a contribution based on wages, ranging from 3.5 percent of annual wages under $12,000 to 7.9 percent of $24,000. Employees would pay the remainder with subsidies for families below 150 percent of the poverty line.
 
Early Retiree: Initially, early retirees not yet eligible for Medicare would have guaranteed access to insurance at community-wide rates. Beginning in 1998, the Government would pay 80 percent of the cost of an average premium for all but the most affluent people. Part-time work or a spouse's earning would alter this subsidy.
 
Medicare Recipient: The elderly would continue to receive the same benefits, plus new prescription drug and home-care coverage. States have the option of bringing Medicare beneficiaries into health alliance, but only if benefits equal or are better than current coverage and a fee-for-service plan is offered. Monthly premiums would rise, especially for affluent retirees. Once alliances are established, people turning 65 have option of remaining in their former health plan, paying any differnce between Medicare contribution and plan cost.
 
Medicaid Recipient: Poor people on Medicaid would receive mainstream medicine, signing up for a plan through the alliance. In most cases the Federal and state government would make set payments to the health plan, rather than paying providers on a per-service basis with a fee schedule as in the past. Recipients could choose any plan with premium at or below the regional average without making additional payment.
 
Student: Students attending school full time in a distant location, but covered under their family's policy would sing up for coverage through the alliance where they attend school. A Portion of family and employer premium payments would be transferred from the home alliance to the alliance providing coverage.
 
Illegal Immigrant: Illegal immigrants would not be eligible for coverage through the health alliance but could still receive emergency and other care as they do new.

HEADLINE: THE DEBATE: The Red Tape;
Less Paperwork or New Headaches?

BYLINE: By PETER KERR

 BODY:
President Clinton's promise to cut the mounting paperwork clogging the American health care system will be welcomed by consumers befuddled by complex benefit forms. And it could save a great deal of money for doctors and hospital administrators who have to employ staffs to cope with the bewildering range of forms and requirements imposed by insurers.
But at the same time, critics are asking whether Mr. Clinton's proposed new layers of state and Federal agencies would simply replace one set of costly bureaucratic headaches with another. 
 Under the Clinton plan, hundreds of existing insurance forms would be replaced by a single simplified claim sheet for both doctors and patients. And because standardized benefits packages would replace the widely varying benefits now offered by insurers, consumers would find it easier to compare plans, and doctors and hospitals would save billions of dollars now spent paying administrators to decipher what is covered under each patient's policy.
But even if the Clinton plan makes life simpler and less expensive in these ways, many health care experts are asking just how much huge new Federal and state agencies and boards would cost, and whether they would simply create more red tape for consumers, doctors, hospitals and businesses.
 
Specter of Monster Agencies
 "There is a tremendous potential for this to become highly bureaucratic and highly regulatory," said Uwe Reinhardt, a professor of political economy at Princeton University. "The kind of people who run the department of motor vehicles would be the kind of people who would staff the alliances. Who else would staff it?"
Under the Clinton plan, most people and companies would buy health insurance through large regional alliances that would represent perhaps a million consumers or, in big cities, even more. These alliances, set up by state governments, would determine which medical groups and insurers could offer health plans to the public and how much they could charge. They would collect and distribute most insurance premiums and collect and publicize data on the performance of health plans.
Because these alliances are charged with many responsibilities, critics say they could grow into monsters that would be unresponsive to consumers' problems and become the focus of a new industry for lobbyists and regulatory consultants. The result, they say, is that overall savings in administration may not be as great as the President hopes.
"In the end, I frankly don't think it will simplify things at all," said Joseph A. Califano Jr., a domestic policy aide under President Lyndon B. Johnson and Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare under President Jimmy Carter.
Still, everyone agrees that paperwork and duplication plague the current system, and some of the Clinton proposals are widely cheered.
Large hospitals now employ entire departments of highly specialized workers just to determine what each patient's insurance policy covers, what information each insurer demands, whether a second or third type of insurance may supplement the patient's primary coverage, and how to redistribute the costs of the uninsured among the bills of insured patients.
 
Paperwork Everywhere
 In his speech in September, the President cited the example of Washington Children's Hospital, saying it spent $2 million a year filling out unnecessary forms. If doctors and other medical providers were freed of that paperwork, he said, the hospital could treat 10,000 more children a year.
Medical groups say that many private offices have also been forced to hire administrative staffs to handle forms, and that some doctors spend more than 20 hours a week on paperwork.
The White House estimates that administrative costs account for at least 15 cents of every dollar paid to insurance companies in premiums. The Clinton plan would cut four to six cents in current administrative costs, Administration officials say. The new alliances and other new administrative costs would add about 2.5 cents in costs, they say, for a net reduction of 1.5 to 3.5 cents for each dollar spent on health care. "If you are familiar with the incredible disorder now, you know that things can be better," said Paul Starr, one of the President's advisers on health care. "This plan will be a huge help to small businesses and to consumers." The White House contends that the Clinton plan would simplify things in several ways.
In addition to the standardized benefit packages and streamlined claims forms, the Administration hopes that employers will no longer need to employ health benefits specialists or pay health insurance agents and brokers to find their employees the best health plans. That would be left to the alliances and the employees themselves.
The White House also says the Clinton plan would simplify Federal regulations on Medicare and Medicaid and cut bureaucracy by merging the medical benefits of workers' compensation and automobile insurance policies with the health plan's coverage.
 
'Major New Bureaucracy'
 Mr. Starr said consumers would be safeguarded by the requirement that the alliance's boards include equal numbers of representatives of employers, consumers, the self-employed and other covered groups.
The alliance boards would not include people associated with health care providers, law firms involved with health care, pharmaceutical companies or suppliers of medical equipment and services.
But a number of health economists and public policy specialists say the plan could create bureaucracies that would be at least as expensive as those in the current system. Their concerns center on the alliances.
"I am not sure there is going to be that much savings," said Patricia M. Danzon, a professor at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania who has studied the administrative costs of health care in Canada and the United States. "It all adds up to a major new bureaucracy that is duplicating functions that today are being performed elsewhere in the system." Experts predict many alliances will collect and distribute more money than the governments of the states in which they operate.
Professor Reinhardt said he feared that in cases where consumers found that the alliance had an incorrect address or Social Security number, they might face civil servants who were less responsive than workers at large insurance companies.
Mark Pauly, the chairman of health care systems at the Wharton School, said another cost to society of the Clinton plan would be new industries of lobbyists and consultants who specialize in guiding their clients through the various alliances in each state or through dealings with a new Federal entity, the National Health Board, which would oversee the state alliances.

HEADLINE: THE DEBATE;
Some Fear Rationing of Care

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

 BODY:
Of all the facets of President Clinton's plan for overhauling health care, few have generated as much heated debate as his proposed constraints on medical spending. The proposal has prompted warnings that it will undermine the quality of care and possibly lead to rationing.
Braking medical spending as sharply as the President proposes -- cutting annual growth by more than half of what it has been in recent years -- could force strapped medical groups to shortchange patients, denying them useful tests and treatments, some doctors and insurance executives maintain. While these critics also fear for their own incomes and profits under the Clinton plan, their warnings are echoed by many economists. 
 Nonsense, Administration officials say. They and many medical experts portray an American system so replete with inefficiency, duplication, overcharging and overuse of procedures that huge sums can be squeezed out for many years to come.
Right now, health care consumes 14 percent of the gross national product, up from 10 percent in 1981. Under the Clinton plan, spending would bulge in the next three years as uninsured Americans were covered, reaching 17 percent of the economy, but officials hope it would stay on a plateau at that level for years to come.
The White House wants to curb spending by limiting premium increases in health plans, limiting Government expenditures and pressuring drug companies to hold down prices.
Without the Clinton overhaul, Government experts predict, medical spending in the year 2000 would reach 19 percent of the gross national product, with tens of millions of people still not covered, and would keep climbing.
"When an American physician tells you that at 17 percent of the G.N.P. we'll have to ration, that seems bizarre on its face," said Uwe Reinhardt, a health economist at Princeton University and an expert on European health systems that spend far less.
But Dr. Reinhardt added, "The issue is the speed of the slowdown in spending, not the ultimate level."

HEADLINE: THE DEBATE;
A.M.A. Challenges the President's Plan

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The American Medical Association has urged doctors to lobby patients to oppose central elements of President Clinton's health plan, including Federal regulation of health insurance premiums and cuts in the growth of Medicare and Medicaid.
At a political education conference here and in documents sent to all doctors across the country, leaders of the A.M.A. punctured the spirit of bipartisan euphoria that briefly hovered over the plan after Mr. Clinton presented it to Congress in September. 
 The association said some parts of the plan, like the proposal to guarantee health care for all Americans, were good for patients. But in a letter to 670,000 doctors and 40,000 medical students, leaders of the association said they would "activate an unprecedented national network of physicians" to persuade Congress to make substantial changes in Mr. Clinton's proposal. Hundreds of doctors, organized by the association, have taken their case to Capitol Hill in a lobbying blitz.
The doctors do not have a veto over legislation but are expected to wield considerable influence in Congress because many are prominent in their communities and contribute to political campaigns. The association itself has a $7 million budget for lobbying.
Dr. Lonnie R. Bristow, chairman of the association, said: "The President has offered the country a prescription for what ails our health care system. While we agree with his general diagnosis, we disagree with some of his treatment decisions. He's prescribing some pretty stiff, new and untried medicine. We are worried that no one really knows what the side effects are going to be."
Previously, the association's tone had been conciliatory, as it worked quietly behind closed doors to influence Mr. Clinton's proposal. The Administration has swung between seeking the cooperation of the A.M.A., whose opposition has proved fatal to a long series of health care proposals, and preparing to do battle with it.
The A.M.A.'s tone has become more aggressive as members have focused on details of the Clinton plan. The doctors said their positions reflected their patients' interests, not just their own economic interests.
At the conference, doctors booed and hissed Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, when she told them of the President's proposal to limit medical malpractice lawsuits, a proposal the doctors see as inadequate.
While vowing to be constructive, the doctors criticized crucial parts of Mr. Clinton's plan to hold down health costs and reshape the medical system. Administration officials rejected the criticism but said they would work with doctors toward a compromise.
The association said it "unequivocally opposes a national health spending budget," which Mr. Clinton proposed.

HEADLINE: AMERICANS REACT: VIEW FROM MIDDLE AMERICA;
Voices of the People: Struggles, Hope and Fear

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa

 BODY:
For four families in the middle of America, President Clinton's promise of health care coverage "that can never be taken away" has hit home, addressing what is clearly a shared yearning.
In interviews before and just after the President's speech to Congress in September proposing a new national health care system, the families, including people who are insured and uninsured, employed and unemployed, healthy and sick, all said they welcomed the promise of secure health insurance for all. They were first interviewed about their health and needs in May. 
 They welcomed the President's promises of Government-guaranteed care for all and the right to insurance even when they lose jobs. The elderly were especially pleased by his promise to preserve Medicare and, for the first time, to include prescription drugs in the program.
Some fear that under Mr. Clinton's proposals they might have to pay more from slim incomes for the insurance plans they already have. Some are skeptical -- about the President, about gridlock in Washington, about the financing of the plan and about the influence of lobbyists representing doctors, drug companies and insurance companies. But all are relieved that a President has finally taken on the health care tangle.
"I liked everything he said," said Debra O'Connor of Lisbon, Iowa, a single mother of three young boys who worries about layoffs at her company and fears that she is only a pink slip away from losing her health insurance. "I think it can work if everybody gives it a chance."
Ms. O'Connor, who works at an aerospace company, said she took her relatively low-paying job not because she liked the work but because she would pay only $7 a month for a comprehensive health plan. She expects to have to pay more if the Clinton plan succeeds, and so be it, she says; at least her dread about the consequences for her children in the event of being laid off will be reduced.
The two families with the most to gain were those of Leo and Elma Patten of Cedar Rapids, who are unemployed and largely uninsured, and Maria Weirather, who has been driven to poverty by bills for cancer surgery. But the Pattens worry that under the Clinton plan they might not be able to keep the doctor who they say has helped them get through an onslaught of medical problems, and Ms. Weirather is skeptical about the Government's ability to carry out the Clinton plan.
An older couple, William and Gertrude Coen, now find themselves very comfortable with Medicare, the health insurance program for the elderly. But they are concerned about the possibility that an illness requiring long-term care could drive them into poverty.
Here are the stories of these four families, their hopes and their fears:
 
The Pattens
Access to Doctors Is a Major Worry
 Leo Patten, 62, and his wife, Elma, 58, are both unemployed because of their health. Mr. Patten, whose emphysema has cut his lung capacity to 40 percent of normal, is only partly insured. His wife, who is unable to get insurance, is a diabetic who has had numerous operations for a host of problems, including double bypass heart surgery.
So they were happy to hear Mr. Clinton's promise of secure medical coverage for everyone by 1998 -- security that they have desperately needed.
But as they watched the President unveil his plan on television, they worried that they could lose access to the one person they credit for keeping them going: their family doctor, Jo Lynn Glanzer.
"She treats us so good," Mrs. Patten said. "She'll call and ask how we're doing."
The Pattens worked all their adult lives until their health forced them to stop. Mr. Patten says smoking -- he quit in 1975 -- and the foul air of the factories where he worked as a machinist brought on his emphysema.
He has Medicare because he has been disabled for more than two years, but because of his pre-existing condition he cannot get supplemental insurance to pay for doctors' and hospital bills that Medicare does not cover, or for any of his medicine. Because of her medical history, Mrs. Patten said, the price of health insurance is far beyond anything she can afford.
Working until a year ago, most recently marking prices on goods at a women's clothing store, she had insurance from employers that covered most of her huge medical expenses, including the heart bypass surgery, a mastectomy, a hysterectomy and two wrist operations for a repetitive motion injury related to her work.
After decades of middle-class security, the Pattens, whose savings are down to $2,000, fear that another setback will drive them out of their $65,000 white clapboard home and onto the welfare rolls.
"A person keeps their nose to the grindstone, works hard, pays their bills on time," Mrs. Patten said in a letter to Hillary Rodham Clinton. "Then when your health goes bad they kick you into a corner."
The Pattens' annual income is now $23,460, the total of the $1,374 Social Security disability check that Mr. Patten gets each month and $581 a month in disability compensation from his last employer.
They spend about $1,100 a year for medicine -- one expense they would largely avoid under the Clinton plan, which would extend prescription coverage to all. Dr. Glanzer accepts Medicare's payment for Mr. Patten's visits and lets Mrs. Patten pay for hers in small installments. Mrs. Patten's disability will qualify her for Medicare in July 1994, but she wonders what would happen if she needed another operation before then.
Their one worry about Mr. Clinton's plan concerns Dr. Glanzer. She has joined a group of doctors who will compete to provide health care to businesses and their employees. In theory, under the structure the President has proposed, the Pattens should be able to choose that plan, or keep going to Dr. Glanzer under Medicare. But both the doctor and her patients feel uncertain about how the new system would really run, and they wonder whether things will work out as smoothly as promised.
"They will be better off with their medicine and their insurance," Dr. Glanzer said. "But in terms of whether they keep me as a physician, I don't know. You may get a choice, but maybe not the choice you want."
 
The Weirathers
Cancer Bouts Bring On Poverty
 Marie Weirather is the embodiment of the Pattens' fears of being driven into poverty.
Ms. Weirather, who is 26 and divorced, lives with her two spirited little girls in a trailer in Iowa City that has flimsy, sheet-metal walls. Her disastrous bouts with cancer and the medical system have drained her of all her money and even personal possessions. She would welcome the changes proposed by the President, but she is skeptical about how soon they will materialize.
Her living room is also the master bedroom, with a foot-high double bed taking up the center. Her daughter, Andrea, who is 4 and entering a Head Start program soon, is asleep in the back, and Beverly, 5, is in school.
Ms. Weirather (pronounced WY-rather) is living on food stamps and welfare checks of $426 a month, because of her medical problems. She also receives an $895-per-semester Federal Pell grant to go to the University of Iowa here part time.
Once Ms. Weirather's care was simple and automatic. Her former husband had insurance through his job as a mechanic at a Chrysler dealership when, in October 1990, a malignant tumor was found on her left ovary. "I went in, and they said, 'Surgery,' " she said. "Within a week, I had surgery." After the divorce, Mr. Weirather left his job for another without insurance. Her eyes welling up, Ms. Weirather said that a year after her operation, doctors spotted another growth on the same ovary. They removed it last fall.
Public assistance paid for the operation and her chemotherapy, she said. "But I was left owing $5,000 to the hospital," she said.
Ms. Weirather owns nothing to speak of anymore. "I had a 1990 Dodge Spirit turbo," she said. "It was essential transportation." She sold it for $4,000 along with a small piece of land to pay the bill. "It was the one really nice thing that I had, and the only new car that I ever owned," she said.
And she still owes $500. After finishing a temporary job as a laboratory aide in May, she became eligible for Medicaid.
She said she welcomed Mr. Clinton's promise of nearly free care for herself, but she does not intend to wait to see the promise fulfilled. She has her own health insurance plan -- marriage in December to a man who hopes to follow others in his family into the Army. The Army provides family health care. She would complete college, having a little more than a year to go, and become a respiratory therapist.
"I'm not getting married for the financial aspect of it," Ms. Weirather said, "but it sure is a nice bonus."
She believes the health care system will take ages to fix. "The Government's going to have to put price controls on what doctors charge," she said. "That's going to be a big controversy. And the bigger companies are going to have to absorb some costs. I have a hard time visualizing it happening, even in 5 to 10 years."
 
The O'Connors
Taking a Pay Cut To Get Coverage
 Debra O'Connor is a true doubter when President Clinton talks about how he intends to finance his health care program. But when it comes to the plan's principal selling point -- guaranteed coverage regardless of job status or other factors -- she is a true believer.
After all, it was the lure of a good, affordable health insurance plan that led Ms. O'Connor to switch from a higher-paying job managing a pizza parlor to a $6-an-hour assembly job at a Rockwell International aircraft electronics factory in Coralville, Iowa, two years ago.
And now, with the aerospace industry in turmoil, it is the fear of being laid off and losing that good health insurance that has her wishing for a plan like the one Mr. Clinton has proposed.
Ms. O'Connor is a 30-year-old single mother of three boys, ages 5, 7 and 9. She lives with her parents in a farmhouse in Lisbon, Iowa, a village southeast of Cedar Rapids.
Zachary, the 7-year-old, has asthma, she said, and a simple bee sting means a trip to the hospital. "It always triggers an asthma attack," she said.
When her youngest child, Kyle, had an attack of croup and a viral infection about a year ago, Ms. O'Connor had to drive him 20 miles in the middle of the night along icy roads to a hospital in Cedar Rapids.
The hospital bill was $1,814, but her entire cost under her company's insurance plan was $100.
"I don't even fill out any medical insurance forms," she said. "For me it's very simple."
At her former job, Ms. O'Connor was told that she would have to pay $250 a month to provide health insurance for her children. "There was no possibility I could afford to do that," she said.
Since taking the job at Rockwell, Ms. O'Connor's pay has increased to $8.20 an hour, which is still much less than her previous job, which paid almost $10 an hour, or $22,000 a year. But at Rockwell, "I got full insurance benefits for $7 a month," she said. "That was a big deal for me."
She pays $10 to visit any of the affiliated doctors, $25 to use the outpatient services of St. Luke's Hospital in Cedar Rapids and $100 for any hospital stay. She also pays $3 per prescription for generic drugs and $10 for brand-name drugs.
Still, Ms. O'Connor is skittish. The rise in health care costs is nipping at her insurance plan. Until this year, she said, prescriptions were free. And she cannot be sure of what lies ahead for Rockwell.
The aerospace company recently laid off more than 100 workers at a nearby plant, but Ms. O'Connor's plant is still humming. No one has ever been laid off there, she said, but with the industry's problems, it could happen any day.
As the President put it, she is one of the millions of workers who are "just a pink slip away" from losing their health insurance. With only two years' seniority at Rockwell, she would be among the first to go if business slumps.
"I want to keep that plan, even if I'm not there," Ms. O'Connor said, and Mr. Clinton assured her she could. Even if Rockwell begins charging her more for her health coverage, she said, "that's O.K. as long as I know I always have insurance."
 
The Coens
A Good Life With a Big 'If'
 William Coen, 79, the retired postmaster of Iowa City, and his wife, Gertrude, 77, had been worried about what the Government might do to their health care coverage, but they liked everything they heard from the President. "He said he'd keep Medicare," Mrs. Coen said. "He said we'd have long-term care and mental health -- all those things. You know, when you're older, things happen."
For the Coens, health care is effective and gentle on their finances. Like 99 percent of the population 65 and older, they are covered by Medicare, the Government's health insurance program for the elderly, and they also have private insurance that covers most of what Medicare does not. "For us," Mr. Coen said, "it's O.K. the way it is. I know it's not for a lot of other people."
The couple have paid off the mortgage on their compact split-level house in an Iowa City subdivision. They have a pension, Social Security and savings that give them an income of more than $40,000 a year.
Their sole significant out-of-pocket health expenses last year were $1,939 for medicine and $1,828 for insurance for hospitalization costs not covered by Medicare. The one thing that worries them, however, is the possibility of being struck by a disabling illness that would require long-term care. Such care can eat up $30,000 a year or more and is not covered by Medicare. Mr. Coen's mother died at 93 of Alzheimer's disease after seven years in a nursing home. She was indigent by then, having exhausted proceeds from the sale of her four-unit apartment house that was also her home.
Of course, the Coens could buy insurance to pay for long-term care. But that could cost them $1,000 or more a month, and they say the policies are riddled with exclusions. "When you need it most," Mrs. Coen said, "it doesn't do you any good."
The Coens were relieved to hear the President promise to help with long-term care. But Mr. Coen wants to see the details. Mr. Clinton has mainly proposed more assistance for home care for the disabled, and has deferred any major new coverage of nursing home costs. If the proposed new nursing home assistance would cover only $30,000 of the cost of a one-year stay in a nursing home, Mr. Coen said, "then I don't think that's too great a come-on."
Mr. Clinton's proposal to cover prescription drugs through Medicare, though, came as a relief. That would have saved them almost $2,000 last year.
Mr. Coen said there was "a fear that Medicare premiums are going to be raised quite high," but he added that those costs, after the cuts in spending for drugs, might not make a big difference in their annual income.

ERIC OWEN MOSS IS something of a lone ranger on Los Angeles's architectural frontier. His buildings cannot be classified by style or school. They possess an off-kilter energy; at the same time, they're grounded in modernism. However, it's modernist literature, rather than architecture, that inspires them -- Joyce's "Ulysses," as opposed to Mies van der Rohe's Seagram Building. "I'm always looking for new ways to reshuffle reality," Moss explains. "In architecture, as in life, the problems never change, just the solutions."
So in Los Angeles, where houses on spectacular sites are as ubiquitous as unemployed actors, Moss was confronted with a narrow shoebox lot with no views to recommend it. The clients wanted something special, something (to use a 60's word) "mind-bending." Moss obliged with a building that looks inward. In place of exterior views, this house has its vistas inside. 
 He began by fusing a rectangle, a cylinder and a cone into a single cataclysmic mass. The soaring interior space is crisscrossed with catwalks and flooded with light from windows placed every which way. Wherever you look, there is motion. Climbing the dizzying stairs, you might expect to experience vertigo. Instead, it's more like wonder: there is something unanticipated to see at every turn.
But the ultimate surprise is not how radical this house looks -- after all, this is Tinseltown -- but how livable it is. Here's a space that defies description, and yet, as Moss put it: "You still know where the groceries come in and where to find the terrace. The garage is exactly where it should be, and so are the kids' rooms."
Moss excels at charting an unknown path through middle-class turf, turning a workaday reality into something startling. Or, in the best modernist tradition, he makes good on Ezra Pound's exhortation: "Make it new."

HEADLINE: THE OUTLOOK: The Future;
Plan Is No Panacea But a Remedy for Costs And Major Inequities

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA

 BODY:
Suppose President Clinton's health plan is adopted. Suppose every American gets a health insurance card and no one need worry again about being uninsured. Will the nation be healthier?
The answer might seem obvious. After all, 37 million Americans are uninsured. How could the plan do anything but improve the overall health of the country? 
 Oddly, medical and public health experts say that although the system may increase access to health care and although it may be more equitable than the current system, it will not necessarily make Americans healthier, at least by the broad measures generally used to gauge public health.
The problem, health experts say, is that the proposal for overhauling health care is not really a health program. Instead, it is a plan to pay for doctor visits, prescriptions and hospitalizations. It is a plan to insure that no one is bankrupted by medical bills. But sickness and death are often caused by poverty and dangerous habits like smoking, which will not necessarily be affected. Many people who disregard advice to have children vaccinated or to have a Pap smear or exercise or eat less fat or drink less alcohol will not change their ways because they have health insurance.
 
Benefits for Many People

 To be sure, President Clinton has always promoted the plan as what it is: a way to address gross inequities in health care and to get medical costs under control. In his address to the nation in September, he said the urgent priority was "giving every American health security, health care that can never be taken away."
And many people are expected to gain enormous benefits. For example, Uwe Reinhardt, a health economist at Princeton University, said: "Uninsured people now think twice before they go to a doctor for a headache or even a lump in the breast. Every contact is so, so expensive."
And Dr. Alan Garber, an internist and a health economist at Stanford University, said some people who are now uninsured would undoubtedly benefit from the plan. Others said that poor people now receiving spotty care on Medicaid might do better with a family doctor in a health plan.
But "you have to ask how much difference the health care system can make," Dr. Garber said.
Dr. Reinhardt noted that the Clinton plan was a financial security plan. In fact, it is called a health security plan. Instead of promising good health outright, the American Health Security Act promises that all Americans will have health insurance, with access to plans that meet national standards on benefits, quality and access to care.
"That is very important," Dr. Reinhardt added. "But if you want to make them healthy, get them out of poverty."
One problem in trying to decide how the health plan will affect the nation's health is deciding how to measure health. Public health officials often look at two measures, infant mortality and life expectancy. Neither statistic is likely to be altered perceptibly by the Clinton health plan, experts say.
 
The Class Factor
 Infant mortality is highest in the inner cities, where pregnant women often suffer from more than lack of health insurance and where they often have Medicaid. They may be teen-agers, they may smoke heavily, or use cocaine or heroin, and they may have a very poor diet.
Dr. Reinhardt noted that in Britain women had prenatal care through the national health service for more than 30 years. Yet, he said, infant mortality among people in the lower social classes is still triple the rate among people in the higher classes.
Dr. Garber said infant mortality was particularly troubling because "it is heavily influenced by factors outside the medical care system." Nor is longevity likely to change, experts said. Dr. James W. Vaupel, a medical demographer at Duke University and Odenske University Medical School in Denmark, said there was little relationship between a nation's health care delivery system and its average life span. The United States has an average life span of 75 years, a figure comparable to that of European countries, where health care is readily available to all. But it is also comparable to China and Costa Rica, poor countries where "the level of care is very, very low," Dr. Vaupel said. "There may not be a lot of connection between the quality or level of care and life expectancy.
"Medical care sometimes saves our lives. But the main purpose of medical care is to help us get over an acute illness." And that, he said, does not measurably change a nation's average life expectancy.
"Even if you saved 100,000 lives, it wouldn't show up in the life expectancy figures," Dr. Reinhardt said. "If you write down the equations, you realize what unbelievably dramatic changes have to happen" for life expectancy to budge.
So, Dr. Reinhardt said, "if you want to judge health reform by measurable health status indicators, you'll be sorely disappointed." While the Clinton plan's focus on preventive medicine is generally a good thing, Dr. Garber said, "we shouldn't be surprised if the effects are small" -- even in looking at specific diseases.
One reason is that many people are already receiving preventive care, like vaccines for their children, screening to detect diseases early or blood pressure checks, even if they have to pay for it themselves. So for a noticeable difference to occur, there would have to be a substantial change in the health of those who would suddenly have health insurance.
 
Hard Populations to Reach
 But many people who do not get such care are among the most difficult to reach. They often are poor and poorly educated. Dr. Robert Blendon, a professor of health policy at the Harvard School of Public Health, said: "If you remove the financial barrier, some will come in, but not all. Another group comes in after an educational effort." As for the third group, the most recalcitrant, "you literally have to send the vans out to get them," he said.
A second reason that gains will be limited is that doctors have only a limited arsenal of preventive and early detection measures. These include childhood vaccinations, screening for high blood pressure, Pap smears and mammograms. Many conditions cannot be prevented: most cancer, birth defects, many cases of heart attacks. Others could be partly alleviated by changes in personal habits, like stopping smoking or eating a low-fat diet.
A decade ago, the Rand Corporation conducted a huge study of free medical care, including preventive services. The only improvements found were among the poor people in the group: more of them got glasses and their blood pressure levels were slightly decreased. The study, which involved 3,958 people, aged 14 to 61, concluded that "free health care did not improve health status." It also said the people who received free care visited doctors more often, spent more time in the hospital and perceived themselves as sicker than those who had to pay.
And in places that stress preventive services, like Hawaii, very few people take advantage of them. "Whenever we offer preventive services, like mammograms or Pap smears or cholesterol screening," said Robert Mytinger, who is vice president for community relations at the Hawaii Medical Services Association, "we never get more than 25 percent of the eligible population."
Of course, Dr. Blendon said, there are aspects of health care that are not captured by health statistics but that do improve people's lives. "Medical care will affect pain and disability, but when you talk of mortality or life expectancy, that doesn't show up," he said. "My mother is convinced that if she has her cataract out, she's healthier. But that won't affect her life expectancy." In fact, national surveys repeatedly showed that people did not become healthier because they went to doctors.
"You go to a doctor when you're born, when you have babies, when you get really sick, and just before you die," said Dr. Donald Patrick, a professor of health services at the University of Washington in Seattle. "Otherwise, if you're lucky, you stay out of the medical system."

HEADLINE: THE MEDICAL BUSINESS: Drug Companies;
Pressure to Keep Prescription Prices Down

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
Exchanging verbal thunderbolts with the companies that make prescription drugs, President Clinton has denounced high prices that force some sick and elderly Americans to skip meals to pay for medicine.
His proposals for revamping the medical system would fundamentally affect drug companies, pressuring them to hold down prices and in some ways treating them as much like a crucial social service or public utility as private profit-seeking businesses. 
 For their part, the drug makers say the President is unfairly singling them out. They assert that his proposals would cripple research budgets, delaying cures for scourges like AIDS, cancer and Alzheimer's disease.
Drug company executives say their products save money and lives by helping to avert expensive hospital stays and surgery. But critics assert that the industry took advantage of patients and payers for years by raising prices at more than double the inflation rate in the late 1980's and early 1990's.
The companies insist they have turned over a new leaf and are already holding down prices. They say this is partly because they are under pressure from health maintenance organizations and insurance discount plans. Under attack by Congress, the President and the First Lady, 17 large drug makers have promised to keep their price increases in line with the consumer price index.
Pharmaceutical executives say they are pleased that the Clinton plan would add an estimated 70 million people to the 174 million who already have insurance coverage for drugs. Drugs are included in the basic insurance all workers would get. Also, for the first time, the Federal Medicare program would pay 80 percent of prescription costs for the elderly and disabled; now, the program pays only for prescriptions for hospital patients.
But Jerome R. Brimeyer, a securities analyst at Lehman Brothers, questioned whether Congress would approve the drug benefit. It would add $14 billion to $20 billion a year to Medicare, he said, making it harder for the President to deliver on his proposal to sharply curtail increases in Medicare spending.
 
Attack on Four Fronts
 Under the Clinton plan, drug prices would come under attack on at least four fronts:
*A new National Health Board could investigate "unreasonable" prices, requiring a company to bring in its records if a drug price was higher in the nation than abroad.
*Companies would have to return to Medicare a rebate of 17 percent of their average nationwide price for each drug paid for by Medicare. The drug industry says such rebates would cost it in excess of $2 billion a year.
*The Secretary of Health and Human Services could bargain down the prices of new drugs before Medicare agreed to pay for them. If the companies resist, Medicare could refuse to pay for these drugs. Doctors would need permission from a Government official to prescribe, for Medicare patients, drugs deemed unreasonably costly.
*Most Americans would be expected to join plans that offer financial incentives to use the lowest-priced drugs. And by limiting increases in health insurance premiums, the Government would force insurers to keep reducing costs, including those of drugs.
Drug company executives argue that the Clinton proposals are price controls, which they insist do not work. They say prices should be kept low by competition. But critics noted that some companies had long exploited the demand for patent-protected drugs by setting high prices.
G. Kirk Raab, chief executive of Genentech Inc. of San Francisco, one of the most successful biotechnology companies, said the price constraints "could slow down or eliminate the volume of research" by making it harder for young companies to raise money from investors. Genentech's products include genetically engineered human growth hormone and a drug that dissolves blood clots after heart attacks.
Investors supply at least 80 percent of the working capital for biotechnology companies, and there are more than 1,000 small biotechnology companies, of which 235 have sold stock to the public. But the biotechnology industry still has only two dozen drugs to its credit and 130 more awaiting approval by the Food and Drug Administration.
Critics like Senator David Pryor, Democrat of Arkansas, say that companies have spent years pouring research dollars into products that duplicated already available drugs. The F.D.A. said that only 40 percent of the new drugs approved last year were a significant advance over existing ones.

HEADLINE: There's No Simple Suicide

BYLINE: By Lisa Belkin; Lisa Belkin, a former reporter for The New York Times, is the author of "First, Do No Harm," a book about medicine and ethics.

 BODY:
By the time the Rev. Ralph Mero arrived at Louise J.'s tiny Seattle apartment, she had already emptied the contents of the sleeping pills into a small cereal bowl. He had suggested mixing the 40 Nembutal capsules with something sweet, to make them more palatable; Louise chose a blend of applesauce and ice cream. Years of illness had left her too weak and shaky to open each tiny pill by hand, so instead she punctured the outer coating with a hypodermic syringe. Then she squeezed each capsule gently between her forefinger and thumb until the powder spilled out in a dusty cloud.
The resulting concoction was waiting in the refrigerator when Mero rang the bell, shortly after 8 on the brisk August night. Louise's mother was already there, as was the one friend, a medical assistant, who had agreed to share this intimate moment. No one but Louise had handled the pills. Only her fingerprints were on the bowl. It would not do to implicate her new friend Mero, or her mother, or her doctor, or the handful of others who knew about and had helped her with her plan. 
 After the initial greetings, Mero sat on the couch where Louise lay curled in her favorite flannel nightgown and thick woolen socks. He took her hand in his, looked her in the eye and told her she could change her mind, that no one would think less of her for it, that she could wait until another day.
"I'm ready now," she told him.
"Once you eat that, you're going to fall asleep very quickly," Mero said. "Don't you want to go lie on your bed before you start?"
"I've never really cared much for my bedroom," Louise answered. "This room is where I want to die."
She quickly spooned up the last soupy drops. Then she lay back into the pillows and closed her eyes, as her mother stroked her hand. Her friend began to read a chapter from a fantasy novel Louise had not had time to finish. By the second page, Louise was snoring loudly.
The friend continued to read, quietly, not raising her voice above Louise's rattling slumber. She turned page after page, for nearly 20 minutes, until the chapter was over. Then she put the book down and stood with Mero and Louise's mother around the living-room coffee table, while the minister said a short prayer. He thanked God for the gift of life and for the young woman now relinquishing it. It would be cruelty, he said, for her to continue living in such pain. He asked help for all God's children who are suffering. What he did not ask aloud was what everyone was hoping silently -- that Louise would stop breathing soon.
COMMITTING SUICIDE IS NOT AGAINST THE law in Washington State, where Louise lived and chose to die. Helping someone commit suicide is. Mero sees this distinction, however, as a challenge, not a hindrance. This past spring he co-founded an organization, Compassion in Dying, to help terminally ill patients end their lives. Its members include doctors, nurses, social workers and members of the clergy like Mero, a Unitarian Universalist minister for 30 years.
What Compassion members will do is almost limitless: offer advice on lethal doses, counsel bereaved family members, convince wary doctors, literally hold a patient's hand at the moment of death. What they will not do is simple: they will not provide or administer the drugs. It is a role that some call heroic and others call heretical. Mero was either Louise's savior or executioner, depending on one's point of view.
"God in his wisdom sent me the help I need," Louise said in an interview earlier in the summer. "I can't believe that this wonderful man is willing to be there for me."
That view impels a harsh reaction from people like Ned Dolejsi, executive director of the Washington State Catholic Conference: " 'I am God, I control life and death,' that's what they're saying. God is God, and we're not. It's that simple."
Behind these polar positions lies an open secret of medicine. Assisted suicide, though generally against the law, happens all the time. In six years of reporting about health care, I've heard countless stories, offered freely and without regret, from people who have helped other people die. A minister recalled how he watched a parishioner and his wife flush two bottles of heart medication down the toilet, then sat through the night with the family as they waited for the patient to have his inevitable heart attack. A graphic designer told of lying to his own doctors, saying he could not sleep, then giving the resulting sedatives to his lover, who wanted to shorten the agony of AIDS. A wife described the peace she felt helping her suffering husband empty dozens of capsules into a vanilla pudding she had cooked for him. A social worker remembered searching the house for medication with which her cancer-ridden father could mix a lethal cocktail, finally offering him the last of her own tranquilizer prescription. As she waited for him to die, she said, she wished she had saved just one tranquilizer for herself.
Doctors tell these stories, too -- although their involvement is usually less direct and less dramatic. More than one doctor has matter-of-factly spoken of writing prescriptions for sedatives and painkillers, suspecting -- often knowing -- that the patient would consume them all in one final, desperate, swallow. And for patients who can not swallow, intravenous morphine can be prescribed liberally.
Such assistance is not offered every day by every doctor, and is still so morally and legally ambiguous that no doctor who shared his story with me was willing to attach his name to it. But one doctor, Timothy E. Quill, has gone public. In 1991, Quill, a physician at Genesee Hospital in Rochester, wrote in a New England Journal of Medicine article of a leukemia patient he had known for several years. He supplied her with a barbiturate prescription, knowing that she planned to commit suicide to end her suffering; three months later, she did. Both the Monroe County District Attorney and the New York State Health Department investigated the case, but no charges were brought.
And of course there is Dr. Jack Kevorkian, the Michigan physician who helps patients die with the help of a tank of carbon monoxide and a mask and who, in contrast to Quill, faces felony charges for violating an assisted-suicide law in his home state. Mero has met Kevorkian (the world of assisted suicide is a small one) and strongly dislikes his approach.
"I think Dr. Kevorkian is an unfortunate spokesman for a good cause," Mero says, in the slow, measured tones in which he says just about everything. "He has so personalized the issue of assisted suicide that a lot of people forget about the patients and think only about this one strange physician. He appears reckless, unrestrained, flagrant."
Those three words are unlikely ever to be applied to Mero, a cautious, deliberate man who is not necessarily joking when he says: "I was spontaneous. Once. When I was 9 years old." Even on a subject as passionate as death, he speaks with the quiet understatement of someone who long ago wrestled with the shades of gray and emerged, as he describes it, with "no doubts whatsoever, absolutely none." And when the topic is Compassion in Dying, Mero talks so slowly that a listener sometimes wonders if the next word will ever come.
"It is important that I be precise, and accurate, and careful, and not say something that might be misinterpreted," he says. "Much is at stake. Much is at stake."
What is at stake is Mero's vision of the future as a time when all doctors can openly do what many doctors are already doing surreptitiously: helping patients to die. He describes Compassion as a "ministerial demonstration project," an experiment in assisted suicide, designed to "show, demonstrate, prove, that when people make a claim for humane treatment, it can be provided in a way that does not jeopardize vulnerable people or pose a threat to the social fabric."
Compassion in Dying, in other words, is a prototype, a model for other, similar programs throughout the United States. With that in mind, Mero and the other members of Compassion have set up their organization with a constant eye toward the long term, creating written guidelines that cover every detail, from how patients are chosen to how many Compassion members will attend an assisted death. Almost everything about the rules, in fact the very existence of the rules, can be seen as a determined contrast to Jack Kevorkian.
"I personally know he is a very thoughtful and deliberate physician in his relationships with his patients," Mero says of his more visible, more vocal predecessor. "But he has not made any effort to communicate that to the American public. Dr. Kevorkian provides no information about how he selects the patients he chooses to help, no overall framework or guidelines. To many people, his penchant for publicity appears unseemly, and appears designed to focus attention on him rather than on the greater issue, that suffering people have a right to choose."
One of Compassion's most essential rules, therefore, is secrecy. Kevorkian calls the authorities after each assisted suicide -- by early November, he had been involved in 19 -- and, police radios being monitored as they are, the press and the police often arrive at the scene simultaneously. Compassion, in contrast, does not announce its assistance in a suicide. In fact, in the three cases that the organization has admitted involvement in so far, the medical examiner's office was not told that the deaths were suicides. The patients' doctors, who knew in advance of the plans, certified the deaths as expected and natural, so no autopsies were performed.
"There is no reason why death should be a public spectacle," Mero says, his voice tightening. "Death is a universal human experience, characterized by grief, loss, memory and hope. It seems poorly served to have it sensationalized and hung out like so much dirty laundry."
Compassion's code of secrecy, however, inherently limits its broader goal; it's hard to change the world if no one knows you're doing it. Mero acknowledges the conflict.
"We have to be exceedingly careful in dealing with the tender privacy of people's anguish, but at the same time," he adds, forming a scale with his hands as if weighing one value against the other, "we want the world to know what we are doing, and show that it can be done in an ethical, responsible manner."
It was that calibrated balancing act, I suspect, that made this article possible. After weeks of discussion with Mero and other members of the Compassion board, I was invited to watch the group work, in direct contradiction of its secrecy rules. There were, however, some limitations. The most significant was that Louise's real name not be given. Louise is the name her mother almost gave her when she was born, and it is the name her mother has taken to calling her now, as if to evoke the other, unborn daughter -- the one meant not to die.
Similarly, I have agreed not to identify the illness that led to Louise's decision to die; doing otherwise, Louise feared, might provide a clue for anyone trying to identify her and could expose her mother to harassment or arrest. What can be said is that Louise's condition was painful, debilitating and invariably fatal, causing, among other things, the eventual disintegration of her brain. The numerous doctors caring for her all agreed that her death was inevitable and, by the time she decided to take her own life, no more than a few weeks away.
LOUISE HAD MENTIONED SUICIDE periodically during her six years of illness, but the subject came into sudden focus in May during a somber visit to her doctor's office.
"I had an awareness of an inner shift taking place," Louise recalled. "I really wasn't having any different symptoms, I just knew something had changed. I looked the doctor right in the eye and said, 'I'm starting to die.' And she said, 'I've had the same impression for a couple of days.' "
An M.R.I. scan confirmed that the frontal lobes of Louise's brain had begun to deteriorate, a sign that led her doctor to warn Louise that her life would most likely be measured in months, perhaps weeks.
"She explained that she didn't want to scare me," Louise said of her doctor, a warm, down-to-earth woman. "She just wanted to be honest. She told me that once the disease becomes active it progresses very fast, that I would become mentally incapacitated and wouldn't be myself, couldn't care for myself anymore. She would have to look into hospice care, or the hospital, or some other facility, where I would stay until I died."
Once the doctor had finished speaking, Louise did not hesitate with her answer. "I can't do that," Louise remembered responding. "I don't want that."
Her doctor, Louise thought, looked both sad and relieved. "I know," the doctor said. "But it has to come from you."
"I just want to be clear that we're both talking about the same thing," Louise had emphasized. "Suicide."
"Yes," her doctor answered.
"O.K. That's what I'd like to do, go for as long as I can and then end it."
The doctor explained that she would be willing to help -- that in fact she had helped another patient several months earlier, a man Louise knew. The doctor would prescribe enough barbiturates to accomplish the goal, but could not agree to be there when Louise committed suicide.
"She didn't want any legal trouble," Louise later said. "I didn't want to get her in any trouble. I just wanted some help."
They exchanged several hugs, then Louise went home. The doctor wrote a carefully worded note about the meeting in Louise's chart. She made no mention of the discussion of suicide.
AS SPRING DRIFTED INTO SUMMER, LOUISE'S health steadily declined; in July the doctor called Compassion in Dying. She had heard of the organization through a hospice nurse who had come to believe that in some cases even a hospice did not meet a patient's needs. The doctor wanted advice. For all her years of medical school, she had no training in how to help a patient end her own life. Of course she had some educated theories, and a handful of literature on the subject. Both Derek Humphry, founder of the Hemlock Society, and Betty Rollin, author and television reporter, have published best-selling books on suicide; Humphry's book offers a detailed recipe.
But even with those available instructions, it is surprisingly complicated to cause one's own death, or, in the case of the doctor, to estimate what is necessary to cause someone else's. Chronic patients like Louise develop tolerance to certain medications, requiring higher doses than the literature would advise. Some have difficulty tolerating alcohol, which is recommended as an accompaniment to speed the effect of barbiturates. Other patients have trouble swallowing food and keeping it down, creating the risk that only part of the dosage will be ingested, inducing coma but not death.
The doctor's one experience with a patient's suicide had made the complications clear. The patient, also a friend, had asked for her advice. After researching the issue, she gave the man "a couple of options," which he then took to another physician in another state where he was living at the time. The doctor was not present, so she does not know which drugs were used nor the dosage, but she believes that, in the end, the friends who were with him may have had to "use the bag" -- that is, place a plastic bag over the unconscious man's head until he suffocated.
So it was with great relief that the doctor called Compassion in Dying and spoke at length to Mero.
"I was ecstatic to find someone who's doing what he's doing," she said. "I loved the fact that there were guidelines. It made so much sense. This was a human being who could help, not some book."
Mero seems to have a knack for putting people immediately at ease. He is a quiet, nonthreatening figure, with a soft voice and a friendly face all but obscured by his beard and glasses; his outer calm offers only a hint of deeply buried emotion. Most appealing, though, is Mero's ability to listen without judging. He talks of suicide as if it is just another form of medical treatment -- a welcome reaction for patients, doctors and families who expect to be met by shock or scorn.
There was no one moment, Mero says, when he developed his ease with the subject of death; the process was an incremental one. Born in Seattle 56 years ago, Mero grew up in Chicago, where he lived until he graduated from college. In 1958 he began working on his doctorate in sociology at Emory University in Atlanta, but when he told his advisers that he planned to do his thesis on the sit-in movement and patterns of race relations in the South, they rejected the topic as unacademic. Mero left school and took a job as a welfare caseworker in Yonkers, where he became active in a local Unitarian church. The minister there persuaded him to join the profession, and Mero entered the Meadville-Lombard Theological School, a Unitarian Universalist seminary in Chicago, in 1961. While there, he became active in the growing civil rights movement, joining the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s 1965 Selma march. By the time Mero became minister of a small church in suburban Seattle, he already had a reputation for being outspoken.
During six years of controversial stands, Mero, already married (he would later divorce) and the father of two sons, watched his congregation grow from 45 members to 145. "I always understood that the purpose of religion was to help make sense of the issues of the day, and to address the troubles of those who are suffering," he says. "In order to have any authenticity at all, religion has to alleviate the suffering of people in pain."
When a recession hit Seattle in the early 1970's, and his parish could no longer afford his $11,000 salary, Mero worked in the secular world, first with Planned Parenthood, then as the administrator of a private medical practice. The departure, which he viewed as temporary, has stretched to 20 years.
In 1988 Mero happened to attend a conference about euthanasia. The subject struck a chord. Two years earlier, his father had died a slow, difficult death from emphysema and heart disease. The elder Mero often talked of taking his own life with a pistol he had saved from his days as a World War I pilot. During one visit to his father, Mero removed the weapon from the house, believing then, as now, that violent suicide "is an unacceptable, tragic end." "There is no peace," he says. "That would have been a terribly painful experience for my stepmother."
At the same time, Mero's brother-in-law was suffering from AIDS. Mero spent much time with him, and, later, with an acquaintance who was also in the final stages of that disease. "I was utterly horrified and outraged that lovely human beings should have to die in such a decimated state," he says.
The euthanasia conference, sponsored by the Hemlock Society, which lifted the veil of silence on the subject of assisted suicide in the United States in 1980, showed Mero a way to act on that outrage. Within weeks, Mero helped start the first Hemlock chapter in Washington State, and shortly thereafter took a full-time job as the group's northwest regional director. He traveled throughout four states, speaking publicly about assisted suicide and collecting advice from doctors about methods that had worked for their patients. During those years Mero assisted in several deaths, though never as directly as he does now. People would call him, at the office or at home, often in the middle of the night, telling him of the drugs they had on hand and asking if that was enough to do the job.
"On several occassions," Mero says, "I was the last person to talk with a dying patient before they committed suicide."
In 1991 Mero once again changed his life. Although he didn't take much credit for it at the time, he was an author of Initiative 119, a voter referendum that would have made it legal for doctors in Washington to help some terminally ill patients take their own lives. No state allows such an expansion of a doctor's role; only one country -- the Netherlands -- permits physician-assisted suicide. The battle for voter opinion in Washington was fierce. Mero's camp found itself parading suffering patients before the press, trying to balance privacy with urgency. The opposition, meanwhile, spent large sums portraying proponents as ghoulish doctors intent on murdering the poor and elderly. Lost in the cacophony was the more reasoned debate between those who believed suicide could be a rational choice and those who worried that the emphasis should instead be on comforting the dying and controlling their pain.
The proposition was defeated, 54 percent to 46 percent. Mero took the loss hard. He had been touched by the stories he had helped publicize during the campaign, and was enraged when one patient, an elderly farmer in Spokane, walked into a pasture a few days after the vote, put a shotgun to his head and pulled the trigger. The man had been waiting for the election results, his wife explained to reporters. He had promised her that, if the vote turned out favorably, he would hold on for several more months, secure in the knowledge that a doctor would be there to help him die.
"It was unforgivable that people who had been counting so much on this as a sign of hope were now to be thwarted," Mero says. "I felt the way you feel when you've done all you can and it isn't enough."
Mero partly blamed Kevorkian for the defeat of Initiative 119. During the final weeks of the campaign, Mero heard that Kevorkian was timing his next assisted suicide (a double suicide, it later turned out, involving two chronically ill women) close to the referendum vote. "I called him and asked him if it was true," Mero says, "and whether he had considered what affect that might have on what we were trying to do. He was quite angry. He indicated that what he did was no one else's business and he really didn't care."
Why was Kevorkian angry? "He couldn't bear being out of the limelight," Mero speculates, alluding to the relative esteem in which the Hemlock founder, Derek Humphry, is held. "I think he was peeved that Derek Humphry's book was a best seller while his own book was sitting in a warehouse, unsold." Whatever the reason for Kevorkian's actions, their impact could not be ignored. "He helped two women die little more than 10 days before the election," Mero says. "Those deaths took place in a cabin in the woods and provided a visual image for our opponents to use suggesting that doctor-assisted suicide was reckless and macabre. It had a very negative effect."
AFTER THE DEFEAT, FRIENDS and colleagues urged Mero to put his energies into drafting a new initiative, one more likely to pass, but that tactic struck him as too slow. If the law could not be changed, and immediately, then it must be challenged.
"Initiatives are very uncertain and unlikely of success regardless of the issue," he says bitterly. "Almost all are defeated, except those promising relief to the taxpayer. If you had an initiative today on the Ten Commandments, I doubt it would pass. If Americans were asked to vote tomorrow on the Bill of Rights, some ad agency would launch a campaign against it."
So, at a Hemlock Society board meeting in March, Mero unveiled a proposal he and others had worked on for several weeks and had thought about for more than a year. He initially referred to the plan as "civil disobedience," remembers Don Cook, a retired computer manager who attended that meeting and who is now the treasurer and co-chairman of Compassion. "We later decided that was a poor choice of words," says Cook. "We wanted to be careful, not confrontational. We concluded we didn't want to break the law in any blatant sense. We wanted to test it."
By April, the national Hemlock Society leadership concluded there was no place within its organization for what Mero was proposing if he meant to break the law at all. It was suggested that a new group be formed. The parting was amicable. Although the two groups are separate, half the members of the current Compassion board also sit on the local Hemlock board, and Compassion and Hemlock have adjacent office space. The new board met in that space at least three times a week for several months, trying to work out the legal, medical and moral details of what they planned to do. They faced questions that had no precedent in any other organization's bylaws.
For weeks, members discussed whom the new group should help. For ethical reasons they decided that patients must be terminally ill and relatively close to death, disqualifying people who potentially had productive years left. By also insisting that patients be residents of Washington State, the group hopes to avoid becoming a wandering suicide squad, or the state from becoming a suicide mecca. To defeat criticism that they were making medical decisions without medical knowledge, members established an advisory committee of physicians, consultants and other health professionals who must examine all patients. And to answer the potential argument that they are giving too much power to that committee, they decided not to help any patient who lacked a doctor who both accepted the suicide plans and agreed to write the fatal prescription.
Those rules masked a wider range of opinion within the group. Sheila Cook, a Compassion board member who watched her mother die slowly of Alzheimer's, wanted to help victims of that disease. Susan Dunshee, co-president of Compassion and executive director of the Seattle AIDS Support Group, frequently encounters patients who, in the final moments of life, are unable to swallow; Dunshee wanted to help patients ingest their fatal doses through an intravenous line, but other members viewed that as too much involvement. Eventually it was decided that only lucid patients who could take their medicines themselves would qualify for help. Patients like Louise.
BY THE TIME LOUISE'S DOCTOR CALLED MERO, Compassion had already assisted in its first suicide. Shortly after Independence Day, Mero and Don Cook had sat in the living room of a 76-year-old man whose prostate cancer had metastasized to the bone. They spent an hour listening as the man reminisced about his life, which had been lived fully and happily, both in the United States and abroad. Then they watched as this relative stranger, whom Mero had met seven times before and Cook had met only twice, ate applesauce laced with 60 Seconal capsules, then took two shots of vodka from a souvenir Seattle mug. In three minutes he was asleep; in four hours he was dead.
Cook remembers feeling strangely disconnected from what he was watching. "I would like to feel closer to the patients than I did that night," he says.
Mero, in contrast, felt no conflict. "My emotional feeling was, this is very special," he says. "Sort of sacred, but not scary. Very meaningful."
For all the years Mero had spent advocating the right to assisted suicide, this was the first suicide he had attended. "I had seen deaths where people were choking, struggling, thrashing," he says, referring to his experiences in the intensive-care units he had often visited as a minister. "But this was a death of serenity, a death wrapped in sleep rather than struggle."
Mero takes solace of another kind from the cases that did not qualify under Compassion's rules and were turned down: the man with emphysema who was overwhelmingly depressed; the two AIDS patients whose doctors would not provide the needed medication. The emphysema patient still calls Mero periodically, once asking him for advice on the most effective place to point the gun. (Mero will not tell him.) The AIDS patients both chose to starve to death. Mero said that the "deep pain" he feels at not being able to help these patients is balanced by the faith he has that, by sticking to the rules, countless other patients eventually can be helped. "The temptation to make just one exception is overruled by the necessity of establishing responsible guidelines that society as a whole will accept."
When he received the call from Louise's doctor, Mero was confident of his rules. And, after hearing the details of her case, he was fairly certain Compassion would be able to help. He suggested two medications to the doctor -- Nembutal or Seconal -- and the recommended dosage of each. The doctor called the pharmacy, found they did not have the strength of Seconal tablets needed and chose the Nembutal instead. Then she made a note of the prescription in Louise's chart, adding that her patient was having trouble sleeping. The doctor made no mention of her conversation with Mero.
MERO VISITED LOUISE several days later. They sat in the living room of her small, peach-walled apartment, surrounded by pictures of Louise skiing in healthier days. Because she tired so quickly, Louise dispensed with social niceties and came directly to the point. Mero says he will never forget how relieved Louise looked to see that he did not flinch when she used the word "suicide."
Then Louise asked if he would be there with her when she died. When he said yes, Mero thought she might cry. Several days earlier, she told him, she had met with a few close friends, informed them of her plans and asked them to support her in her decision and be present during her suicide. Each friend said yes, only to call back later and say she had changed her mind. Worse than that, Louise told Mero, she had not heard from any of the women since.
"I'll be with you and I'll support you," Mero said, carefully. "But this has to be your choice." It was a caveat he would repeat many times. He wanted to be certain that Louise was certain. Morally, he never wanted to wonder whether he had pushed this patient toward a fatal decision. And, for legal reasons, he didn't want anyone else to ever wonder either.
"I do not want to die in a hospital," Louise answered Mero. "I want to do this at home. All I want these next few weeks is to live as peacefully as possible."
When Louise first met Mero, however, she already had noticed the effects of her failing brain. She found it increasingly difficult to maintain her train of thought, and prolonged conversation exhausted her. Over the course of the following weeks, her doctor had noticed other changes, too.
"She's more irritable, she's paranoid, becoming obsessed with things that aren't so significant," the doctor told me over breakfast in a restaurant a few blocks from Louise's house. Although she didn't think Louise's judgment was impaired yet, she worried that it might soon be. "The question is, at what point is her will going to be affected, and, if suicide is what she wants, does she have the right to do it when she still has the will?"
Like Mero, the doctor did not want to influence her patient. Still, she worried Louise might not act in time. "If she loses her mind and doesn't do this, she's going into the hospital. But the last thing I want to do is pressure her to do this."
IN EARLY AUGUST, NEARLY TWO WEEKS AFTER Mero's first visit to Louise, they met again. This time, Louise's mother was present, as was Louise's doctor and the friend who had agreed to help when the others had said no. It was lunchtime, and the doctor brought a vegetarian pizza. Louise ate a small bowl of cereal instead. It was the first food she had eaten since lunch the day before.
For a while, the conversation lingered on the weather, the food, the day's news, everything but the subject that brought them together. Louise's mother and friend were meeting for the first time. It was an awkward moment for the friend. A medical assistant at one of the many doctor's offices that Louise visited regularly, she and Louise had developed a friendly relationship, but not a real friendship. When the friend heard through the medical rumor mill that Louise's most trusted friends had backed away, she called Louise and offered her support. In the days since, they had formed the instant intimacy so often born of necessity. Still, the friend felt uncomfortable meeting Louise's mother. "But she was so warm, so relieved to have someone to share this with, that I felt reassured I was doing the right thing," the friend now says. "She's a grand, tough lady. She reminds me of Colleen Dewhurst. I've never met anyone that strong."
The idle talk continued until Louise, tired by the effort of eating and the noise of conversation, put down her cereal and lay back into the couch with a sigh. Mero took this as a cue to begin. He handed out a printed checklist titled "Steps to Assisted Dying," which Compassion makes available only to patients they have agreed to help. Suddenly businesslike, the group reviewed the nine items one at a time.
"One," read Mero. "It is important to have food in the stomach. Eat a small amount of food two hours before beginning the process of dying. Make it something you like: toast, applesauce, ice cream are recommended." Food, he explained, would prevent the nausea and vomiting that can result when medication is taken on an empty stomach.
Louise said she had not had any appetite lately, but if a light meal would make the process more effective, she would do her best.
"Two. After eating, take two anti-nausea tablets."
The friend said she would pick up something appropriate. Mero then explained Step 3: how to mix the medication with food and suggested several variations. Louise nodded. When Mero reached Step 4, which listed the types of alcohol and the amounts considered most effective, she stopped nodding and began to shake her head.
Her mother interrupted. "Louise doesn't drink."
"I can't drink," said Louise. "I can't tolerate it. I would throw it all back up."
Mero explained that the alcohol "potentiates" the barbiturates, making them work faster and more effectively. Without the alcohol, the barbiturates might be enough to put Louise into a coma, but not enough to kill her.
"Well, I can't drink," Louise said. "So I have to hope for the best."
There was nothing more on the list for Louise to do. The rest of the instructions were aimed at her mother and her friend.
"Five. During the process that follows, the patient's breathing and heartbeat should be monitored. Breathing will become very slow and shallow. Put a mirror in front of the nose or mouth to detect breath. A stethoscope is necessary to hear the heartbeat as the pace slows over a period of several hours."
Louise's friend offered to bring a stethoscope.
Step 6 was a list of drugs an attending nurse could administer to an unconscious, dying patient who appeared to be in pain. The friend said she felt comfortable dispensing most of them. Louise did not have several of the drugs on hand, and her doctor suggested substitutes from among the medications Louise was already taking.
"Seven. Be absolutely sure that death has occurred. Test pupil contraction by shining a bright flashlight in the eye. With a stethoscope, listen hard for a heartbeat. The extremities will cool, but this is a sign of reduced blood pressure, not necessarily evidence of death."
Sitting on the couch, Louise looked drained. Mero completed the list quickly. Step 8: After death, the patient should be washed and the sheets changed. The bowel sphincter, he noted delicately, relaxes during death. Before calling the doctor or funeral home, Mero added, make sure all extra medications are out of sight and all the dishes are washed.
Step 9: The doctor, having been contacted by the family, should call the medical examiner's office and tell him the deceased patient was terminally ill and that the death was expected. That way, no autopsy would be performed.
The doctor nodded. She would be out of town for much of the next week, but she had told her partner of Louise's plans. "You don't have to wait for me to get back," she told Louise, hinting that it might not be a good idea to wait. When Louise's mother walked the doctor to the car, the doctor was more direct, saying she worried that her patient might not be coherent enough to act if she waited past the coming weekend. And over the telephone, the doctor had often told Mero the same thing, warning that there was no way of predicting how fast Louise's ability to carry out her plans would evaporate.
The doctor and Mero discussed how pointed they should be with Louise, wanting to give her enough information to make an informed decision without frightening her into acting sooner than she was ready. They chose to be circumspect and cautious, hoping she would read between the lines.
"That's one of the more delicate and difficult aspects of this work," Mero says. "Stepping back and making sure the patient continues to take the initiative in moving the process along. That means some patients will take too long, will not be able to make things work on time. But I will always err on the side of caution and deliberation. They have to make their own choice. Sometimes, not to decide is to decide."
A few days before that meeting, Mero called me at home in New York and asked me to come to Seattle as soon as possible. He knew I planned to interview Louise the following week, but he warned me not to wait that long.
"She's rapidly deteriorating," he said. "Her physician feels if she doesn't act before the weekend, her window of opportunity will slam shut."
I left for Seattle immediately.
Louise spent our interview lying in bed, reaching for the blankets then throwing them off in alternate fits of fever and chills. In her hand she held a tube of Vaseline, which she applied almost constantly to her parched, cracking lips. At her bedside was a glass of water with a straw, which her mother had offered to soothe Louise's raspy throat. When Louise talked, it was in a near-whisper. At times her mother, who has a hearing problem, had to lean over the bed and put her ear to Louise's mouth to understand what she was saying. I, in turn, sat at the head of the bed, so close that we were practically touching.
She began our meeting as she had begun her meeting with Mero -- asking that we not waste time on small talk for which she had no strength. Louise then went on to explain why she wanted to take her life.
"I'm not depressed," she said. "I'm exhausted. Just walking from the bathroom to the bedroom, I have to catch my breath and sit down. There's so much I've lost control of. I want to be in control of this. I can't wait too long. Nobody else can do this for me. I'm tired. I'm in constant pain. I'm getting weaker by the day. I want to do this at home, before my body's here and my brain isn't."
She was not afraid of death, she said. "I think I was, early on. Before I heard about Compassion. But even then my fear was not overwhelming. It's time. This is right."
Louise was almost ready, she said, but not quite. She had nearly completed her mental list of tasks to tend to before she died: she had closed her bank accounts, familiarized her mother with her life insurance and other papers, found a home for her dog. But she still needed to sign her car title over to the friends she originally bought it from. And she was determined not to die before she could rid herself of her Hickman catheter -- the semipermanent IV line through which she received medication and some nutrition. She was too weak to use it, and it was constantly causing infection. The catheter would be removed in a day or two. Then Louise wanted four or five more days to relax with her mother. In all, she needed about a week.
I was surprised, confused and extremely uncomfortable. Both Louise's doctor and Mero had told me that her available time was measured in days. What they had not told me, and would not tell me until later, is that they had not directly explained the situation to Louise.
Without thinking, I blurted out a question: "Your doctor feels that if you don't act by this weekend you may not be able to. . . . "
My words were met with a wrenching silence. Louise blanched, her pale skin turning even paler. I was horrified with myself.
"She didn't . . . she never. . . . I didn't know that," Louise said sharply, looking at her mother.
"That's what she told me," her mother offered gently.
Louise became silent. All her calm words about being certain, of wanting to die, masked the real point. Everyone -- Mero, the mother, the doctor, the friend and, most significant, Louise herself -- had described suicide as something Louise wanted, a poetic expression of control, a triumph over the indignities of disease. But what Louise really wanted, it now became clear, was simply to not be sick any more. If she couldn't have that, then suicide was a second choice. Suicide was not a victory, but rather a nightmarish end to a nightmare, the most acceptable of the unacceptable options. Earlier in our conversation Louise had denied feeling frightened. But now, lying ashen-faced, less than a foot away, she looked terrified.
"It's O.K. to be afraid," her mother said.
"I'm not afraid. I just feel as if everyone is ganging up on me, pressuring me," Louise said. "I just want some time."
We talked a little longer, but her thoughts were elsewhere. Shortly afterward, in the middle of answering a question, Louise fell asleep.
THAT WAS ON A THURSDAY. On Friday, both Mero and the doctor left town. Mero gave Louise his long-distance beeper number, assuring her that he would be reachable 24 hours a day. If she needed him, he said, he could return within three hours. The doctor left a number, too, but would be too far away to be of any real help.
The atmosphere at Louise's apartment was tense. Louise was growing more irritable, and her mother was exhausted trying to keep pace with Louise's demands. The mother prides herself on being a strong woman, strong enough to obey Louise's wish that not even her family be told that Louise committed suicide. The mother confided only in her priest, and she never once gave way to tears in front of her only daughter. "I've locked it away in a corner of my soul," she often said. "I'll deal with it someday."
Yet she was not strong enough to say no to Louise. When the mother brought white paper towels back from the supermarket, and Louise insisted she needed blue ones, the mother returned to buy a different color. When Louise decided she needed a special foam overlay for her mattress, at a cost of more than $100, her mother set out to find one, not daring to question the wisdom of buying something so expensive that would only be used for two or three days.
In part, the mother was repenting for an earlier loss. Her own father had died when she was barely out of her teens. She was sitting at her father's bedside one day when he asked her to read him a passage from the Bible. She agreed to, but was briefly distracted by whatever bit of knitting or reading she was immersed in at the time. When she looked up, her father was dead. As a result, she had sworn never to ask Louise to wait even a moment for anything.
"If she had said 'jump,' I would have said 'how high,' " the mother says. "I wasn't going to go through that kind of guilt again."
There was more than guilt at work, however. The mother was growing less certain that her daughter would actually take her own life. The long-term investment in the mattress pad, she thought, might be a signal that Louise had changed her mind and wanted to hold on for as long as she could. But when she tried to ask Louise directly, the daughter refused to respond. "I don't want to talk about this anymore," Louise would say. "I feel like it's all we ever talk about."
The friend was also troubled by Louise's erratic behavior, although she saw something else in it entirely. The unusual irritability and irrationality were signs that Louise's brain was succumbing to illness and medication. The friend wondered: How much can you change the brain before you change the person? Was Louise still capable of making decisions about her own life and death? The friend was not averse to risk; indeed, in moving to Seattle years before, she had left a conservative Southern town and a wealthy, prominent family. But she was beginning to wonder if she was in over her head.
"This is not the woman I know," she confided late Friday night. "This is a different person. Which is the real Louise? The one who was so sure this was what she wanted, or the person who is here now, who doesn't seem sure? I hope she doesn't decline any further, because I would not feel comfortable helping her if she does. And I wouldn't want to back out on her like everyone else did."
The next morning a crisis erupted that thrust all the doubts into the open. Louise had finally reached the last item on her list of things to do -- the removal of the Hickman catheter from a vein in her chest. A private ambulance took Louise and her mother to and from the hospital where the relatively simple procedure was performed. But shortly after they arrived home, Louise felt a trickle down her chest. She was bleeding from the site where the IV tube had entered, and the bleeding soon became profuse. It took most of the rest of the morning and every towel in the apartment to staunch the flow. During most of those hours, Louise sat naked in the bathtub, so as not to ruin her clothes and her furniture.
At lunchtime, Louise's friend came to visit. Both Louise and her mother were extremely upset. "I didn't know what to do," the mother told the friend. "Do I let her die in the tub or do I call 911?"
If an ambulance came, Louise would be taken to the hospital, where she would stay long enough that her chance to commit suicide would probably pass. But if dying is really what's best, her mother anguished, why did they use every towel in the house to keep Louise alive? Did the daughter really want to die? Did the mother really want her to?
The friend offered to speak to Louise. "I kind of want to get an idea of what your time line is," the friend said to Louise in a quiet moment later that afternoon. "Where do we stand?"
Louise was silent, her eyes brimming with tears.
"I just don't want to talk about it anymore," she responded, as she had responded to her mother.
The friend apologized, saying that she thought this kind of discussion was what Louise had in mind when she asked her to come for lunch.
Louise said she would wait for Mero to return on Sunday, then ask for his opinion of her decline over the weekend and her odds for holding on for several more days.
Carefully, the friend said that she thought that was a bad idea, because the changes in Louise's temperament were so subtle they might be missed by someone who did not know her well.
Louise thought about that for a few minutes.
"Maybe I'll ask Ralph to come back a little early," she said, in a tone that indicated that the subject was closed.
LOUISE DID NOT ASK MERO TO come home early. Defying everyone's predictions and fears, and following her own internal timetable, she made it through the weekend, weak but still coherent.
By then, prosecutors in Michigan had announced that they were charging Kevorkian with assisting a suicide in violation of a state law passed specifically to stop him. Although he had helped 17 people commit suicide by that time (and has since helped two more) the indictment was for only one of the deaths -- the one that occurred after the law was passed.
Mero is not sure whether he runs the same risk of arrest as Kevorkian. His only guidance, if it can be called that, is the murky and uneven legal history of assisted suicide in the United States. Generally, every state prohibits assisted suicide, either by precedent or by statute. But the laws are rarely, if ever, enforced. In the state of Washington, for instance, the law says "a person is guilty of promoting a suicide attempt when he knowingly causes or aids another person to attempt suicide," a felony offense punishable by up to five years in jail and a $10,000 fine. But in the past 10 years, only one assisted suicide case has even been referred to the King County Prosecutor's Office, that of a man encouraging a distraught woman to carry out her threat to jump off a building. The man was never indicted because prosecutors felt there was insufficient evidence. The more recent and relevant example, that of Dr. Quill in Rochester, incurred no indictment.
Mero's legal future, therefore, will probably depend on how authorities choose to define "assistance." Like Kevorkian, Mero is present at the time of death, but unlike Kevorkian, he leaves it to the patient to secure the means of death. Like Quill, Mero's group counsels the use of barbiturates, which are prescribed in the context of the disease that precipitated the suicide in the first place. Carbon monoxide gas, on the other hand, has no similar medical purpose, and in the end is reminiscent more of Nazi death camps than sickrooms. But like Kevorkian, Mero has made it clear that he is willing to help as many patients die as he can -- differentiating him from Quill and nearly everyone else who assists in a suicide.
Compassion in Dying's board, well aware of these yardsticks, has established its policies to tread as close to the perceived line as possible without stepping over it. Leonard H. Glantz, a professor of health law at the Boston University School of Public Health, has long studied assisted-suicide laws in the United States, and says he believes Mero's group has succeeded.
"What it comes down to is, he talks to people," Glantz says of Mero. "If he did other things, like take the pills, mix them in the applesauce, hand the patient the spoon, that might be different. But it sounds as if he's careful about that. If charges were brought, they would be criminal charges, and the case would have to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The question is what does 'aid' mean. And I don't think talking, under those circumstances, would be construed as aid."
Whatever the risk, it is one that Mero is willing to take. "I have no interest whatsoever in going to jail," he says emphatically. "I am not doing this for martyrdom. But if that's what happens, I am prepared. I don't know if there is any legal right either in constitutional statute or case law for what we are doing. I do think that all human beings have a moral claim to humane treatment. And I believe other human beings have an obligation to try to respond to that request. It does not have to do with constitutional rights of a political state. It has to do with our membership in the human race."
OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS, MERO checked in with Louise and her mother by telephone, but kept the conversations short. "I was measuring my phone calls," he says. He wanted to remain in the background and allow Louise to control the timing and the pace. Her growing dependence on his opinion was making him uncomfortable, and he needed to keep it clear in her mind, and his, that she was the driver and he was just along for the ride.
Periodically during those days, he expressed concern that when Louise finally did act, things would not go smoothly. He was particularly concerned that her inability to tolerate alcohol would reduce the effectiveness of the drugs. "Our first case went so well," he said. "Eventually there will be a case where something will go wrong." He hoped Louise would not be the one.
Late one afternoon, Mero came home to a message on his answering machine from Louise's mother. "Louise has chosen tonight. Could you be here at 8 o'clock?"
When he arrived, everything was prepared. Louise had got her wish: she had spent a few quiet days with her mother, watching cartoons and old musicals and talking about things other than death. The time, her friend thought, seemed to have brought back some of her old spark. She seemed like the familiar Louise that night, tired but peaceful, clear about what she wanted.
"I was comfortable being there," the friend says. "There was no doubt in my mind that she was capable of making this choice."
The hellos were said, and Mero asked Louise one last time whether she was certain of her decision. She said she was, and then handed Mero a letter formally requesting assistance from Compassion in Dying. It was the third note she had written since she first contacted the organization, filling yet another Compassion requirement. "I know I cannot continue to live in such a state of deterioration," the final letter said. "I ask again for your assistance with my death."
About an hour after Mero arrived, Louise ate the bowl of ice cream, applesauce and barbiturates. She lay on the couch, her mother sitting next to her. Mero sat on one of two chairs and her friend sat on the other.
Louise finished, took a few sips from a glass of milk, then curled up on the couch. Her friend handed her a teddy bear dressed like a crew member from Star Trek -- a private joke: "Beam me up Scotty. Get me out of here." Then the friend began to read from the book Louise had chosen, "A Wrinkle in Time," by Madeleine L'Engle.
With the bear pressed tightly against her face, Louise fell instantly asleep. When the friend finished reading, Louise's mother performed the last rites, using oil blessed by the family priest. Mero said his prayer, and the small group left the living room and moved to the kitchen. They could hear Louise's breathing as they anxiously nibbled on a cream-cheese coffee cake that a visitor had brought Louise earlier in the day.
MOST DEATHS, IN MERO'S experience, take between two and three hours. But Louise took the drugs at 9 P.M., and at midnight, Mero recalls, she was still breathing loudly, almost defiantly. Mero, exhausted, slept fitfully on Louise's bed. Louise's mother and friend sat in the kitchen talking quietly about the past, not the present or the future.
By 1:30 A.M., the women were growing nervous. The mother was deeply worried that her daughter would wake up in anguish at being alive. They decided to wait an hour before panicking, then another hour.
At 3:30, the friend began to consider calling Louise's doctor for advice, and the mother was resigned to calling an ambulance. But Mero told them he was certain that death would come eventually, and suggested that the drugs be given a little more time to take effect. He refuses to be specific about what he would have done if the all-night vigil had stretched past dawn, although several days after that evening he hinted that he would have made certain that Louise died. The Hemlock Society, whose literature Mero knows thoroughly, advises those who assist a suicide to keep a plastic bag on hand for circumstances such as these.
"I was prepared and had the wherewithal," Mero said. "But I wouldn't want to have had to do that. I would not have let her come back. With her mother there, though, it would have been very difficult. I don't think her mother could have handled the mechanics of further assistance."
Mero later retreated from those words. When I asked him whether actively intervening for Louise wouldn't break every one of Compassion's carefully constructed rules, there was a long silence. "I guess you can accuse us of being nonspecific about that," he said. "We have made it clear to people that they have to self-administer. We have also said we will not abandon them. We have to leave the rest undefined. I think most of the individuals on our board know in their own hearts what the ethically correct thing is to do. Yet as an organization we are limited to doing what we have described."
But hadn't Mero already said that he was prepared to go the extra step? He chose his words even more cautiously than usual. "I think if that had arisen, my good judgment would have prevailed. The guidelines are there for a reason. Everything can't be put in jeopardy because of the elastic conscience of one or another individual." He paused. "Let's just say it's a situation that hasn't come up. I hope to God it doesn't."
In the end, no further assistance was necessary. At 3:45, Louise's breathing suddenly changed, becoming slower, quieter, irregular. The pauses between rasps became longer, the breaths shallower. Louise's three attendants moved back into the living room, saying little, just listening to her breathing.
By 4, it had stopped. Louise had no pulse. Listening through a stethoscope, her friend could find no heartbeat. The doctor and the coroner were called. Mero contacted the funeral director and left shortly thereafter.
Louise's death was not listed as a suicide. Her body was cremated and a memorial service was held several days later. Her friends and relatives were told she died in her sleep with her mother at her side, just as she had wanted.

HEADLINE: Morelia's Colonial Grace

BYLINE: By MARGO KAUFMAN; MARGO KAUFMAN is the author of "1-800-AM-I-NUTS," a collection of travel and other essays (Random House).

 BODY:
MORELIA is not for those whose idea of a good time involves discos, Jet Skis or golf. The capital of the Mexican state of Michoacan is not a high-profile resort destination like Ixtapa or Cabo San Lucas. But the graceful colonial city, built of shimmering pink stone, is a tranquil haven for travelers who are delighted by architecture, folk art and majestic scenery -- or those who just want to kick back and get a feel for the Bajio, the Mexican heartland.
The city was founded in 1541 as Valladolid, after the Spanish town, but was renamed in 1828 in honor of its native son Jose Maria Morelos de Pavon, the revolutionary priest turned soldier who led the War for Independence. Like the city of Oaxaca, to the south, Morelia is noted for its lively mercados and artesanias, but it has yet to become a popular tourist spot. Morelia is an easy (for Mexico) four and a half hour ride from Mexico City on a toll road, or a short flight, but on a recent three-day trip, my husband and I encountered no other Americans. 
 Not that the town lacks amenities to make a visitor feel comfortable. Morelia is remarkably free of congestion and well laid out, with long wide boulevards that lead to the center of town. To get oriented, start at the picturesque main square, the Plaza de Armas, fragrant with roses and bougainvillea, and bustling with frolicking children, ambulantes touting pomegranate seeds, potato chips, and hot cakes, and wizened patrones shining shoes. You might want to try a paleta, a local delicacy made of agua purificada, sugar and frozen tropical fruit. La Michoacana, the Mexico-wide chain that sells this treat, got its start here.
The square, Plaza de Armas, is surrounded on three sides by arched colonnades and several hotels are nestled behind the sidewalk cafes. All the hotels had vacancies in August, but reservations are a must during the first week in November, when the fiesta of the Day of the Dead is held in nearby Patzcuaro.
Perhaps the most beautiful of the city's hotels is the Virrey de Mendoza, a lovingly restored 18th-century mansion with an exquisite stained-glass ceiling in the antique-filled lobby. Our small double room was immaculate and comfortable, with gleaming wood floors and an Oriental throw rug; the four-poster bed had good lighting on both sides. Particularly pleasing was the pristine black and white tiled bathroom with a huge sunken tub. Unfortunately, the only ventilation came from a window with a postcard view of the zocalo and in exchange for fresh air, we got a spirited traffic serenade. The hotel manager insisted that the noise would abate after midnight, but it didn't.
Around the corner was the Posada de la Soledad, a less impeccable but even more charming mansion turned hotel. Built in 1719 around a tranquil courtyard, it was reminiscent of a residence in an Isabel Allende novel, with old carriages parked in the cloistered corridors and brightly painted religious statues adorning the rooms. The rooms varied; the best doubles were spacious and airy, with rustic beamed ceilings and a small balcony. Our room's carpet and furniture were a bit tatty, and the bathroom was tiny, but there was plenty of hot water -- not always the case in Mexico.
IF you're looking for luxury, head for the hills outside of town and the Villa Montana, a deluxe hacienda owned by a French count, Philippe de Reiset.
The hotel has a spectacular view of the city, lush gardens filled with whimsical stone sculptures, tennis courts and a small but attractive pool. All the rooms are furnished in an eclectic combination of Early Aztec motel furniture and antiques and stocked with luxuries like a hair dryer and a clock radio.
A good place to start the day in Morelia is with breakfast at the Cafe Paraiso (103 Portal Galeana), a cheery little restaurant with excellent cafe con leche across from the Baroque cathedral. A codger with a violin, who has obviously not studied under Itzhak Perlman, appears regularly and makes hideous screeching sounds until his palm is crossed with pesos. He relentlessly works the cafes around the square and is hard to resist. After breakfast at Cafe Paraiso, a visitor can amble next door to the Palacio de Gobierno, another 18th-century mansion that was formerly the Tridentine Seminary. Famous graduates include Morelos and Agustin de Iturbide, the first Emperor of Mexico and the man who signed Morelos's death warrant.
Over the main staircase are vivid murals showing dramatic highlights from Mexican history, painted in the early 1960's by Alfredo Zace, a local artist.
To get a good look at the Baroque cathedral -- which, with two 200-foot Baroque towers, was built from 1640 to 1744 -- attend an evening concert given by the local music academy. Tickets can be purchased at the door. We heard a performance of Bach, which was played on the cathedral's 4,600-pipe organ. The interior turned out to be a Victorian hodgepodge, with crystal chandeliers and carved pews, and the organist uninspired. But it was a treat to be able to leisurely inspect the retablos, ceiling moldings and murals without feeling like we were interrupting someone else's prayers.
Another pleasant expedition is to take a taxicab -- you can go almost anywhere in town for 5 pesos, or about $1.50 -- to the ruined aqueduct, a mile-long expanse with 250 arches that was built in 1788 but looks much older. It's a pleasant stroll back through the Calzada Fray Antonio de San Miguel, a tree-lined promenade, especially if you stop at the local sweets market, Mercado de Dulces on Calle Gomez Farias.
Morelia is the candy capital of Mexico, and popular confections include crystallized tamarinds, mangos and guayabas and fudge made of honey and evaporated milk.(Those allergic to bees should be careful; wasps and yellow jackets were swarming on the treats.)
The gummy fruit drops were so sweet I could feel my bridgework rot, so I gave most of them to an elderly vendadora wearing three layers of colored petticoats. In exchange, she offered me a good deal on the tablecloth she was embroidering.
Craftsmen come from the northern villages to sell their wares at the sweets market and a visitor can find bargains like lacquered gourds patterned with fruits and butterflies ($3 or $4, depending on size) or whimsically painted wooden armadillos with bobbing heads at three for $10 -- a fifth the price in Mexico City.
Folk art enthusiasts should also stop at the state-run Casa de las Artesanias del Estado de Michoacan, which is housed in a beautiful old convent made of weathered stone. Crafts from all over the state are on sale in the shop downstairs and on display in the gallery upstairs. Some of the highlights included Ocumicho devil figurines ($7 to $10 for a single one, $45 and up for scenes), pottery from Capula decorated with pointillist flora and fauna motifs (a small platter is $15 to $20), Santa Clara del Cobre copper pots ($95 for a heavy medium-sized one) and a vast selection of gigantic towers made of ceramic pineapples from San Jose de Gracia ($175 for one that stands about three feet high).
What one does with these towers, I do not know. Prices at Casa de las Artesanias are on the high side, though not unreasonable compared with Mexico City, and the staff will box and ship purchases.
A truly memorable outing is the drive or bus ride to Patzcuaro, a little more than an hour through the scenic countryside, past pine forests and volcanoes looming on the horizon. We went via Tzintzuntzan, a tiny village below the huge ruins of the Tarascan culture's main city. Along the road is an open-air crafts market that specializes in intricately woven straw work and hand-painted dishes. A tourist seeking inexpensive but unique souvenirs can buy three-foot strings of straw Christmas tree ornaments -- bells, candy canes and stars -- for less than $5.
Across the street, woodcarvers sell the same exquisitely carved furniture on sale at the Casa des Artesanias for a third of the price. If I could have carried it home, I could have bought a six-foot-high breakfront with a carved frieze of sunflowers for $400 or a headboard in the shape of a horse's head for $45. Never one to be daunted by logistics, my husband pounced on a fish-shaped wooden planter the size and weight of a Yule log, purchased it on the spot for $12 and somehow managed to hoist it into the trunk. It flew home with us as checked luggage.
Patzcuaro, a quaint lakeside village in the Sierra Madre, has well-preserved 17th-century Spanish architecture and a nationally famous Day of the Dead graveyard ceremony on Janitzio, an island in Lake Patzcuaro. The beautiful main square, Quiroga, is shaded by great ash trees and has a fine statue of its namesake, Vasco de Quiroga, the 16th-century bishop who protected the Tarascans from the conquistadors. Wander up and down the cobblestone streets or stop at the library, with its splendid mural by Juan O'Gorman, depicting local history. The neatly arranged Museo de Artes Populares is also of interest, as is Casa de los Once Patios, a collection of boutiques selling handsome weaving and erotic figurines.
For lunch, there is the Cafeteria Dany, a pretty and very clean restaurant off the square. I ordered the famous white fish from Lake Patzcuaro that the guidebooks kept raving about and was disappointed to be presented with several scrawny fish that reminded me a lot of alewives, a low form of marine life I last encountered washed up on the shores of Lake Michigan.
They tasted a little better than they looked, but my husband's three course El Menu with rollos de carne, sopa de Tarasco and a local variation on an enchilada was the better buy. Our meal came to under $16, including tip.
For dining back in Morelia, the Fonda Las Mercedes (47 Leon Guzman; telephone: 12-6113) is a fantastic-looking restaurant. Its best design accent is a six-foot raffia Caterina, the popular skeleton wearing an 1880's dress and a huge hat. This time, the famous white fish arrived swimming in garlic -- a big improvement; My husband's chicken with corn mold -- a smoky tasting fungus is scraped off the corn into the sauce -- was infinitely better than it sounded. Dinner for two, without wine, came to around $50.
At the attractive restaurant in the hotel Posada de la Soledad, specialties include Filete Pescado de Veracruzana and a giant sirloin, with all the trimmings. With appetizers, dessert, and drinks, our bill was under $25. And their weekend brunch is excellent.
Those who are returning to Mexico City by car should leave Morelia by way of Laguna de Cuitzeo, the second largest lake in Mexico, which one can drive across on a causeway. On the opposite shore is a fine 16th-century Augustinian monastery that is in the process of being restored. A permanent collection of amazing engravings -- including some by Jose Guadalupe Posada, the 19th century artist who created the Caterina, the folk symbol represented by the well-dressed lady skeleton at the Fonda Las Mercedes -- is on display in the cloisters.
 
Planning a journey to a tranquil haven
 
Getting There
Aeromar, a commuter branch of Aeromexico, has a 20-seat flight three times a day from Mexico City to Morelia. It takes 50 minutes and costs $157 round trip. Mexicana flies direct to Morelia from Guadalajuara for $42 to $60 one way, depending on how far in advance a ticket is purchased..
We flew to Mexico City and rented an economy car through Avis for $209 for a week, with unlimited mileage. If you drive from Mexico City, it's best to take the toll road through Toluca, Atlacamulco, Contepec, and Maravatio.
Bus and train service also is available.
 
Where to Stay
 The luxurious Villa Montana is located at 201 Patzima, on the outskirts of town in the hills of Santa Maria. Standard doubles are $110 a night, Junior suites are $150 and Master Suites are $170. All prices include a full breakfast; add 20 percent for tax and gratuities. From the United States, reservations can be made by calling (800) 223-6510. The hotel's local number is 14-0231 and its fax number is 15-1423. The code for Mexico is 52; the city code for Morelia is 43.
A good value is the Posada de la Soledad at 90 Ignacio Zaragoza; 12-1888; fax 12-2111. Doubles are $66, and suites are $80. All the rooms are different so ask to see a few before you settle on one.
The Hotel Virrey de Mendoza (16 Portal Matamoros; 12-0633) is lovely, but best in cool weather because many of the interior rooms are stuffy. A double runs from $75 to $94. M.K.

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE VIEW;
Fear, Hope and the Changing of the Guard

BYLINE: By Herbert Muschamp

 BODY:
Mayoral elections are referendums of faith in the city. But they are also experiments in terror. Every four years, New Yorkers are bombarded with grotesquely magnified images of urban horror. The challenger tries to persuade us that things have never been worse. The incumbent insists that even greater catastrophes lie ahead if he is turned out of office. Though the contest is local, the contestants act out a national drama. Their alternating appeals to hope and fear reverberate throughout urban America.
Four years ago, New Yorkers united behind David Dinkins with the hope that the election of New York's first black mayor could reinvigorate the city's embattled liberal tradition. Architecture, planning and urban design have long been part of that tradition, and many New Yorkers who supported Mr. Dinkins hoped that his administration would revive a place for design in urban affairs. After a decade of explosive real estate development (the anarchic cityscape parodied by Anton Furst's set design for the 1989 film "Batman"), people had wearied of the argument that real estate development automatically benefits the city's quality of life. They were looking for a governing intelligence capable of elevating architecture from the bottom line toward loftier ideals. 
 These hopes went largely unfulfilled. Thanks in large part to the recession, the past four years have not witnessed an acceleration of architectural anarchy. But neither will they be remembered by urbanists as a golden era for the nation's largest city. (Paradoxically, Mr. Dinkins's most idealistic contribution was an economic one: his awarding of city contracts to minority businesses was a major contribution to civic life.) It is far from clear that Rudolph Giuliani harbors any vision of the contribution architects and planners can make toward creating a livable city, though some were encouraged by the endorsement he received from Robert Wagner Jr., a former planning commissioner who will be a leading figure on Mr. Giuliani's transition team. A change in administration by no means guarantees a change in policy. But it is an ideal time to make it clear that change is overdue.
The truth is that architecture faded from the liberal political agenda long before David Dinkins took office. Not since the administration of John Lindsay ended in 1974 has there been a strong coalition between progressive politics and progressive design. What has taken the place of architecture is architectural history: landmarks preservation, connoisseurship of period styles and design guidelines that require new buildings to emulate the appearance of old ones.
Even those with no personal memory of the glorious old Penn Station and its ignominious demise in 1963 can appreciate the logic as well as the benefits of this development. Architecture is an urban intruder: a destroyer of memories, a painful reminder that people have little control over their surroundings. Three decades ago, the preservation movement dramatically increased that control. A movement that had been regarded as an elitist pastime became one of the most powerful tools with which citizens could exercise power over the urban landscape. It was a tool directed against real estate development, but inevitably it was turned against architecture. Its particular target was modern architecture, a style whose path had been paved with gestures of contempt for the Beaux-Arts and other facets of the city's rich stylistic mix.
The result of these confrontations was a stunning reversal in social and esthetic values. Where modern architects saw the urban renewal projects of the 1950's and 60's as expressions of social responsibility, others regarded them as an arrogant assaults on the very fabric of their lives. In the years since, the liberal idea has been to resist architecture, not to encourage it, and that resistance remains a valuable force for civic good. But by the end of the 1980's, it had become apparent that this force was insufficient to address the needs of the present. The overarching problem was not change but the pervasive fear of change. A liberal consensus that had staked itself heavily to the past found itself powerless to confront that fear.
The Italian architect Gio Ponti once wrote that the architect's task is "to interpret the life of the inhabitants, transforming it into an expression of civilization and culture." As Mayor, David Dinkins performed a similar function. His dignity and compassion -- and his ability to grasp how important it was symbolically for New York's first black mayor to project these qualities -- offered New York a new portrait of itself. In him, we saw a city that had overcome fear of difference and the unknown. Unfortunately, his administration failed to grasp the role that design can play in redrawing an urban portrait. If Mr. Dinkins's record in architecture and urbanism was disappointing, it was not because his performance was any worse than his predecessors' but because he failed to realize that the city was ripe for new ideas in these fields.
WHEN ARCHITECTS RELY too much on the past, Lewis Mumford once observed, they tend to "think of a new problem in terms of an old solution for a different problem." Two of the major projects of the Dinkins administration bear Mumford out. The city-sponsored competition to design a new terminal building in lower Manhattan for the Staten Island ferry was conceived with excellent intentions. By detaching the terminal from the conventional design procedures of the Department of Transportation, the city hoped to create something architecturally more distinguished than the typical engineered shed.
Unfortunately, the competition, held in 1992, coincided with a moment when the criteria for architectural distinction were being thoroughly reappraised. Architects were in revulsion against the "designer decade" of the 1980's and its reduction of buildings to islands of style in an ocean of urban decrepitude. Many of them had begun to look closely at the infrastructure as a way to reconnect individual buildings to the larger forces that shape urban form.
The ferry terminal project -- whose status may be affected by the forthcoming change in administrations -- missed a golden opportunity to be on the cutting edge. What was needed was not a design that separated architecture from engineering but one that integrated architecture into a regional transportation system. The city's design guidelines, which dwelt on the historical background of ferries and the New York harbor, evoked the authority of tradition but ignored the progressive tradition that had produced such magnificent public works as the George Washington Bridge. While the winning design, an immense clock face by Venturi, Scott Brown & Associates with Anderson/ Schwartz Architects, played wittily with historical precedent, the design's stylish irony was a poor substitute for the broad vision that planning once provided.
The most ambitious planning project undertaken by the Dinkins administration, its "comprehensive plan" for the revitalization of the city's waterfront, also started with excellent intentions. Seeking to stimulate economic development along the waterfront and at the same time enhance public access to it, the plan revolved around a set of zoning regulations designed to balance these competing objectives. Unfortunately, the new zoning, which was approved by the City Council last month, resembled a formula that has already produced dubious public amenities like the atriums in Trump Tower, Olympic Tower and the Sony Building -- places where the public is at best grudgingly accommodated.
Rather than merely balancing the competing interests of the public and private sectors, the plan could have united the two in the pursuit of higher goals. The waterfront marks a border between the urban and natural realms. The plan was an ideal opportunity to introduce ideas for reconciling these traditionally divided spheres. New design codes for "sustainable" -- environmentally responsible -- development. Waste-treatment plants transformed from unwanted projects to desirable public spaces. Incentives for biotechnology and environmental industries to locate on the waterfront, as apparel is concentrated on Seventh Avenue or finance on Wall Street. Recreation areas landscaped by brilliant environmental artists.
Instead of fostering a new relationship between culture and nature, the waterfront plan envisioned nature in 19th-century terms, as a scenic backdrop or as a wilderness to be segregated into parklike preserves. With its emphasis on "reclaiming," rather than planning the waterfront, its use of phrases like "untapped resource" and "last frontier," even the plan's language was soaked in the thinking of an earlier day: the Industrial Age that treated nature mainly as raw material to be exploited for human use.
On election night, a Dinkins supporter explained to a television reporter that the Mayor had lost because the public had not been sufficiently informed about his achievements. But in architecture and planning, the problem was rather the reverse: it was the administration that seemed to be in the dark about the creative ferment in these fields. Although New York prides itself on being the information capital of the world, somehow it has managed to remain impervious to ideas that have helped other cities move forward: the environmentally-based waterfront plan in Toronto, the spectacular array of parks and public spaces in Barcelona, the coordinated, citywide program of public artworks integrated with the infrastructure of Phoenix. The tradition of international competitions that has made contemporary architecture such a vital part of the cultural life of cities throughout Europe and in Japan.
Worse, the city has failed to tap the energy that resides within the city's architecture schools or to enlist the young architects who have amply demonstrated their commitment to public service in projects like the Architectural League's superb studies of urban housing, schools and parks. There are now two generations of architects who have entered the profession only to encounter a climate of indifference to the imagination. They look around and see a city where it has apparently been decided in advance that every new building should look like the Art Deco apartment buildings of the 1930's. Every street should be lighted by bishop's-crook lampposts. Every park should look like an Olmsted park.
No one is arguing that the city should abandon its heritage. The point, rather, is that architecture and architectural history are not the same thing. Though both are fundamental aspects of urbanism, each has a different role to play. While they may be natural antagonists, even the tension between them is a source of strength.
Rudolph Giuliani was elected to hire more cops, not urban visionaries. With a budget deficit of half a billion dollars, it may be unrealistic to hope that he will strengthen the city's woefully understaffed planning department or create an agency similar to the Urban Design Group, which served as a think tank for fresh ideas in the Lindsay years. Still, it is not too much to hope that he will call upon designers as the city musters the energy it needs to face the future.

New Year's in Paris
Q. I will be in Paris to ring in the New Year and am interested in finding out how Parisians typically celebrate the occasion and what entertainment options are available. -- A. E. McCollum, Wayne, Pa. 
 A. Many Parisians go away for the holiday, and a large number of those who don't go away celebrate the New Year with friends at their homes or at a restaurant.
One of the great New Year's Eve traditions, however, is to be on the Champs-Elysees: to meet there and walk down the avenue or drive through while honking the car horn and generally making as much noise as possible.
Following are some cabaret and restaurant choices (reserve at least a month ahead):
Regine's International, 49-51 Rue de Ponthieu, eighth arrondissement, telephone 43.59.21.13. Dinner and dancing with a fixed-price menu at $267 a person, calculated at 5.60 francs to the dollar.
Folies Bergeres, 32 Rue Richer, ninth; 42.46.77.11. Show, plus fixed-price dinner and dancing. Show starts at 8:30 P.M. and dinner and dancing at 11. Orchestra seats $257 a person, club seats $282.
Lido, 116 Champs-Elysees, eighth; 40.76.56.10. Show plus fixed-price dinner and dancing is $419 a person.
Les Bains, 7 Rue du Bourg l'Abbe, third; 48.87.01.80. Dinner and dancing $214 a person.

A. With the exception of the Canary Islands and Madeira, average highs will be in the low 60's, with lows in the high 40's and low 50's. The Canary Islands will be a little warmer, with highs averaging 72 and lows 60; highs in Madeira will be in the mid-60's and lows in the high 50's.
The greatest distinction will be in the precipitation. Gibraltar averages five to six inches in December and January, the highest rates of the year; Casablanca, on Morocco's Atlantic coast, averages over three inches at that time and Madeira averages 3.3 inches. Average monthly precipitation at the other ports of call is about 1.5 inches.

HEADLINE: THE PROBLEMS: HOSPITALS;
Amid Mountains of Paper, a War Against a Tide of Red Ink

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD

DATELINE: PASADENA, Calif.

 BODY:
To find the heart of Huntington Memorial Hospital these days, go upstairs from the gleaming, efficient emergency room, past the pharmacy and around the corridor to the business office.
There, in cramped cubicles, 75 be gone, eliminating a third of all hospitaltoday more a part of hospital care than surgical gloves. Two of them do nothing but copy medical records all day for insurance companies. Others dun insurers and patients for payment in the hospital's ceaseless battle against red ink -- $10 million in losses last year alone because of indigent and uninsured patients. 
 If for no other reason, hospitals generally welcome President Clinton's proposal to overhaul the health system because nearly everybody would carry basic coverage and hospitals could rely on a regular stream of income. Moreover, hospital administrators hope that the Clinton plan to draft a single uniform insurance claim form would reduce the mounds of paperwork.
 
'Access to the Front Door'
 "From the hospital's standpoint, everyone would have access to the front door of the hospital instead of just the emergency room," said Dr. Allen W. Mathias, president of Huntington Memorial, a nonprofit private hospital with 535 beds.
But the plan would mean a difficult transition as hospitals deal with a 180-degree turn in economic incentives. As part of large alliances of health providers, hospitals would be under pressure to keep patients out rather than in. This is expected to force mergers of hospitals and many closings. Hospitals are also deeply worried by proposed cuts in Medicare and Medicaid funds on which many depend heavily.
The effects would vary enormously, depending on the type of hospital. The main beneficiaries would be large urban private hospitals with the financial muscle to absorb smaller community hospitals and form alliances with doctors and other providers.
The outlook is less certain for public and teaching hospitals. They have cared for the bulk of indigent patients who would now have insurance that they could take elsewhere for care. But these hospitals would still be obliged to provide emergency and pregnancy care for illegal aliens, who are not included under the Clinton plan.
And specialized hospitals like psychiatric hospitals, already in deep financial trouble nationally, would face still more stress because the plan would allow only 30 days of hospitalization a year. Least affected, at first, would be rural hospitals, because the areas they serve often lack the critical mass of population, doctors and medical services to fit into the structure of "managed competition" envisioned by President Clinton.
But if passed, the Clinton plan would accelerate trends already under way in many parts of the country, trends forced by the widespread adoption of "managed care" by employers to reduce medical costs and by new technology that has reduced the need for hospitalization. To remain competitive, hospitals have begun to merge and to form alliances with other health care providers.
In short, hospitals are accepting a new reality in which they will take a lesser role in the medical world, as no longer the main centers of care but rather as the places where the most extreme illnesses and accidents are treated.
Probably nowhere have the ills of hospitals been more acute than here in Southern California, where nearly one in three people is without medical or hospital insurance, where hospitals are the main source of care for hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens and where there is such an oversupply of hospitals that the typical hospital fills fewer than half its beds on any given day.
Already this year, at least 18 hospitals in California have shut. And C. Duane Dauner, president of the California Association of Hospitals and Health Systems, predicts that by the year 2000 an additional 150 of the state's 550 hospitals will be gone, eliminating a third of all hospital beds.
"The Clinton plan will bring that about sooner because it creates greater competition among health plans," he said. "The in-patient census will continue to drop. We do not advocate that every hospital should remain open. There will be closures, conversions, mergers, sharing of equipment."
But Mr. Dauner and other hospital leaders remain concerned about other aspects of the Clinton plan, mainly the proposal to reduce growth in Medicare and Medicaid by $238 billion by the year 2000 to help finance the universal access. "We do not believe that is possible," he said.
They also worry about the plan's omission of coverage for illegal aliens apart from emergency and pregnancy care. Moreover, there is concern about the fate of public hospitals when every person has a health card and can buy insurance that might use private hospitals and doctors.
But the current system is so onerous for most hospitals that almost any change would be relief. "We are in full agreement with 75 percent of the Clinton proposal," said David Langness, a spokesman for the Hospital Council of Southern California, which represents 240 hospitals in six counties. "Hospitals have been the most vocal of providers seeking reform, because they are in big trouble, losing money hand over fist."
 
Absorbing a $500,000 Loss
 Consider a major urban hospital like Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital in Inglewood, Calif., which serves a wide area of South-Central Los Angeles and adjoining communities, an area mostly inhabited by low-income people. During last year's riots it treated 372 injured people, only one-fifth of whom had insurance, and the hospital absorbed a loss of $500,000. "It's great to know everyone will be covered," said Peter F. Bastone, administrator of the 365-bed hospital, which is operated by the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet, a Roman Catholic order based in St. Louis.
Daniel Freeman Memorial underscores the reality of urban medicine today: that most people in poor neighborhoods get nearly all their medical care in the most costly and inefficient way -- in the emergency room. Nearly 100 patients a day stream through Daniel Freeman Memorial's emergency room. A majority need primary, not emergency, care. But lacking insurance, they have no other source of care, said Dr. Bayliss B. Yarnell, director of emergency medicine.
Universal health insurance, he said, would permit patients to see doctors before illness turns into emergency. "The emergency room is a very expensive way to deliver primary health care," Dr. Yarnell said.
But how the new system will be financed is a source of worry, particularly since two-thirds of Daniel Freeman's patients are covered by Medicare or Medi-Cal, California's Medicaid program for the indigent.
Even before President Clinton made his proposal, the Daniel Freeman hospitals were negotiating affiliations with 11 other Los Angeles-area hospitals. Eventually each hospital would specialize and share equipment and staff, eliminating duplication in cardiac surgery, obstetrics and the like.
"We're going to be paid less tomorrow, and if we don't find a way to do it for less money, we're going to die," said Daniel P. McLean, president of Daniel Freeman Hospitals Inc., which also operates a smaller unit in Marina Del Rey.
 
Major Changes at Hospital
 Much the same calculus has been made at Huntington Memorial, a teaching hospital with ties to the University of Southern California and the University of California at Los Angeles. Its practices have changed radically with the growing popularity in California of health maintenance organizations, or H.M.O.'s, the kind of group health plans that President Clinton seeks to expand.
The H.M.O.'s pay the hospital a fixed annual fee for every member, and so there is no need to pay for every visit to the hospital. That makes it more profitable for the hospital to do more work on an outpatient basis and to discharge patients quickly.
The hospital has already taken steps to reduce costs, including establishing a primary care clinic, operating nursing homes, setting up a home-health program and affiliating with a nearby hospital, the Methodist Hospital of Southern California, in Arcadia.
In anticipation of the Clinton changes, it is also forming a new entity to be called the Huntington Medical Foundation, to compete against Kaiser-Permanente, one of the original H.M.O.'s, and other major plans. The foundation would buy up the practices of primary-care doctors and then market the combined doctor and hospital services to employers, insurers and, presumably, the new purchasing cooperatives to be established under the Clinton plan.
The hospital hopes the plan will reduce paperwork. In the business office, Jim Farrar, director of patient accounts, supervises a paper empire built of more than 100 different forms. Carol Bradley, vice president for nursing, estimates that 30 to 40 percent of nurses' time is spent filling out forms.

HEADLINE: HOW OTHERS DO IT: Hawaii;
Setting an Example for the Rest of the Nation

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HONOLULU

 BODY:
Residents of the Hawaiian Islands, more than 2,400 miles from the American mainland, have long complained that they are left out of major debates that ripple across the nation.
But on at least one big issue -- how to provide adequate medical care to all citizens -- health policy analysts say Hawaiians are well ahead of the rest of the country, and their state is being studied in Congress and by other state governments as a potential national model. 
 The 50th state is the only one that can boast of near-universal health care. Under a 17-year-old program that requires employers to pick up the cost of insurance premiums for any person working more than 20 hours a week, most of Hawaii's 1.1 million people have some kind of medical insurance. The unemployed, seasonal workers and those whose job does not include insurance are taken care of by state medical subsidies.
Some Special Circumstances In all, 98 percent of Hawaiians have some kind of medical insurance. By contrast, in the country as a whole, 14 percent of the population, or 34 million people, lack medical insurance and get no government subsidy. Most are wage earners who work for small or low-paying businesses.
Perhaps most surprising to many experts, the near-universal access to health care here has not led to soaring costs. While Hawaii ranks near the top of the states in cost of living, its average health insurance premium is near the bottom. For example, a family in Hawaii pays a premium of $263 a month, nearly half that of other states.
To be sure, Hawaii differs from the other 49 states in many important ways. The population is small, the climate is healthful, and the state has a long tradition of providing generous benefits to workers, most of whom belong to unions.
Even during the current recession in tourism, Hawaii has the lowest unemployment rate of any state, 2.8 percent; its insurance companies have to pay little compared to other states for hospital care for the unemployed. Its insurance industry is dominated by a few big companies, which can exercise strong bargaining power to keep doctors' and hospitals' fees down.
It is in the middle of an ocean, so businesses that might object to paying health care costs -- up to $1,000 a year per employee -- cannot simply move across a state line.
But while these oddities help explain Hawaii's success in keeping rates low while providing care to nearly everyone, advocates here and experts on the mainland say the state has much to contribute to the current national debate. "One criticism I hear is that we are different, as if we're all sipping mai tais on the beach and dancing in coconut shell bras," said Dr. John Lewin, Hawaii's director of health. "We have a lot of poor people in Hawaii. We have all the health problems of the rest of the states. But what makes us different is that we decided to do something about it." Dr. Lewin, energetic and outspoken, has become a sort of evangelist for universal health care, which he calls a basic human right. He has spoken to numerous Congressional officials and to leaders in states like California and Washington, where similar plans are under discussion. The thrust of his argument is that the states can provide health insurance for all citizens and keep costs down if preventive care is emphasized, and if there is competition among the major insurance companies to go after the uninsured.
Dr. Karen Davis, a professor of health policy at Johns Hopkins University, agrees. "What Hawaii has demonstrated, to a lot of people's astonishment," she said, "is that they have covered all their people while minimizing economic disruption."
The Hawaii plan took effect in 1974, when much of the country was in a severe recession. Before that 17 percent of its residents were without medical insurance. In the plan, the employee pays a portion of the insurance: no more than 1.5 percent of a person's gross wages, or half the premium, whichever is less. For someone making $2,000 a month, the fee can work out to around $30 a month. The requirement applies even to people who hire domestic workers for 20 hours a week or more, and any business that does not comply can be fined or shut down. State officials say they have had few problems.
As Congress debates a Democratic-sponsored bill to require employers who do not provide health coverage to pay premiums for uninsured workers, the main argument used against the measure is that it puts too much of the burden for national health care on small businesses. But Hawaii's example, experts here say, belies the argument. The state's economy is run by small businesses; more than 90 percent of Hawaii's 27,271 individual enterprises employ 50 people or less, according to the state labor department.
Jean Pinc, who runs the B & L Bike and Sport Shop in Kona-Kailua, on the Big Island of Hawaii, says the additional cost of paying health insurance for three full-time employees has not been a drag on the business. "We want to keep our good people, and one way to keep somebody loyal is to give them good benefits," she said. "Everybody who runs a small business is pretty much in the same situation."
 Not everyone is covered by the Hawaii requirements. In the most important exception, employers do not have to pay for care of dependents. But business people here say the competition for workers is so strong that most dependents are covered.
Last year, a second part of the Hawaiian health plan, intended to cover the 5 percent of the population that falls between the cracks, went into effect. People who otherwise have no insurance pay a small fee for each doctor visit and a portion of the insurance premium. The rest is picked up by the state. The poor are covered by Medicaid, the state-Federal program, as in other states.
The 1990 plan, called the State Health Insurance Program, is runnning below its projected budget cost -- insuring slightly more than 10,000 people at an annual cost of under $1,000 per person. But it provides only basic benefits, covering no more than five days in a hospital per year.
The question most frequently asked about Hawaii's system is how the state has managed to control costs. With Hawaii's isolation and expensive real estate, the cost of living is about 30 percent above the national average. But its health insurance premiums, for a single person per month, average about $94 a month -- well below the $154 average cost for a similiar policy in New York, California's $141 premium and the $282 average for Kansas.
"The secret of our success, the secret that many in the American medical establishment do not want to hear, is prevention," Dr. Lewin said. "We have twice as many outpatient visits, that is, people see their doctors several times a year, and half as many hospital stays, as the national average." People are encouraged to go to the doctor early and often, he said, thus minimizing the chance of costly operations for maladies that could have been prevented.

HEADLINE: THE PROBLEMS: SHORTAGE;
Too Few General Doctors

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
A growing shortage of doctors willing to practice general medicine has left some hospitals and health-maintenance organizations desperate for qualified candidates and, in the long term, stands as a major obstacle to overhauling the nation's health-care system.
Almost all changes under consideration include a central role for what used to be known as the family doctor -- today generally an internist or family practitioner -- who can save the system money by taking care of a wide variety of ailments on his own and referring patients for more costly specialty care or tests only when absolutely necessary. 
 Although such primary-care doctors were once the cornerstone of American medicine, their numbers have dwindled as younger doctors have been drawn to specialty fields by money and the lure of new technology. So today, as more patients enroll in health-maintenance organizations or physician networks that rely heavily on general doctors to hold down costs, a rising demand is confronting a declining supply.
Health economists say that a medical system should have about 50 percent of its doctors practicing primary care, which includes family practice, internal medicine and pediatrics, and that is the mix now favored by most large H.M.O.'s. But the current percentage of primary-care doctors in the country is only about 33 percent, and, worse, it is falling. In 1992, only 14.6 percent of medical students decided to go into general medicine, an all-time low. At that rate, the proportion of primary-care doctors will drop to 28 percent or less by 2010.
"We should try to achieve a 50-50 balance as soon as possible, but we have a long way to go," said Dr. Robert Harmon, administrator of the United States Health Resources and Services Administration. "Even if medical schools started graduating 50 percent primary-care specialists today, it could still take us to beyond the year 2000 to achieve a good mix."
Health economists say it will take a mixture of market forces and policy changes to fill the gap. The marketplace is already at work in some parts of the country, where hospitals and H.M.O.'s fighting to attract coveted generalists are dangling bonuses and salaries that top those for some specialists.
 The Government, too, is offering or considering various incentives like low-interest loans to such doctors as well as to the schools that train them. But few expect such enticements to fully staff primary-care clinics any time soon.
In the short term, health economists, including some of those advising President Clinton, have suggested various solutions, from relying on non-physicians like nurse practitioners or physicians' assistants to retraining underemployed specialists, like neurosurgeons or cardiologists, to do front-line medicine.
In the long term, they say, medical schools and hospitals must be prodded to encourage more doctors to go into primary care, a field that has slipped to second-class status in a medical world increasingly focused on procedures and new technologies.
Estimates differ about exactly how many primary-care doctors are needed in the United States, but the gereral sentiment is: More, and a lot more in rural areas and the inner cities where there are virtually no general doctors left.
 Of the 600,000 doctors in the country fewer than 200,000 are in primary care, and of those some 40,000 are "general practitioners" who never completed residencies after medical school, widely considered an important precursor to good general practice. (General practitioners do one year of practical training after medical schools, compared with three or four for internists, family practitioners or pediatricians. Most specialists receive five to seven years' training after medical school.)
 Faced with this shortage, H.M.O.'s and hospitals around the country are offering internal-medicne and family-practice doctors bonuses and salaries almost double those paid five years ago.
 Harvard Community Health Plan is looking for 40 general internists, said Dr. Thomas Inui, chairman of the new Deparmtent of Ambulatory Care and Preventive Medicine at Harvard University. "If 40 people who were qualified walked in the door today, they would be hired on the spot," he added.
 The tight market has forced FHP, a large health-maintenance organization in the Southwest, to pay its generalists an annual salary of more than $100,000, more than it pays pulmonary specialists or rheumatologists.

HEADLINE: HOW OTHERS DO IT: Germany;
Coverage for All, With Choices

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BONN

 BODY:
If the most critical problem in providing national health care is getting control over rapidly rising costs, as President Clinton has often said, he may find some intriguing ideas in the German health care system, which offers coverage to all at a much lower price than Americans pay.
Germany's much-admired system of health care, provided through nonprofit but private "sickness funds" that are mandatory for nearly 90 percent of the population, leaves patients with freedom to choose their own doctors and their own hospitals, and freedom from almost all medical bills. 
 Germans spend only about half as much per person on health care as Americans do, $1,486 in 1990 for Germany, compared with $2,566 for the United States. As a percentage of gross national product, however, it was 14 percent for the United States in 1992 and a little more than 8 percent for Germany. In 1990, the G.N.P. comparisons were 12.1 percent for the United States and 8.1 percent for Germany.
Visiting a German doctor's office or hospital is much like visiting a good one in the United States. German hospitals are regarded as among the best in the world, and few have the crowded emergency rooms and waiting areas that are common in urban American hospitals because people have no other source of medical care. Neither do they have to increase bills for insured patients to cover those who cannot pay; Germany insurance covers virtually everybody, including foreign workers and asylum-seekers.
 
Caps on Payments
 For years, the German Government has tried to keep medical expenditures from growing faster than the economy as a whole, not so much by limiting benefits as by pressing drug makers, doctors and hospitals to contain fees. The biggest savings have come from Government-mandated programs that brought down the prices of German pharmaceutical products, once the highest in Europe, by ordering insurance funds to pay only what generic drugs cost.
Doctors administer their own payments from the health insurance system, and since 1985 they have agreed to annual caps on total payments, which they share depending on the number of treatments performed.
German general practitioners earn an average of $95,565 before taxes, which puts them among the country's highest earners, but their incomes have not risen as fast as average wages over the last two decades.
Another factor in keeping costs down is that malpractice suits are less common in Germany than in the United States, and so are extraordinary life-prolonging measures for patients judged to be terminally ill. "If an elderly patient is clearly dying of natural causes, I treat her at home," said Dr. Ursula Friedrichs, who, like most of her colleagues, still makes house calls. "I know a hospital stay wouldn't do any good."
Also, according to a study by John K. Iglehart in The New England Journal of Medicine, "German hospitals have fewer pieces of high-technology equipment than most big urban hospitals in the United States."
Still, with a mounting demand for medical services, costs have been soaring here too, putting the insurance funds' billions of dollars in the red last year. To try to bring costs under control, the Government has recently run roughshod over the lobbies of doctors, dentists, hospital administrators and drug manufacturers, all of which are seemingly far less powerful here than they are in Washington. A law that went into effect Jan. 1 imposed reductions in the price of most medicines, tightened the caps on doctors' fees, and changed the way hospitals are paid in order to lower costs.
Germany's system bears little resemblance to the state-run system of cradle-to-grave national health care the British adopted after World War II. It is also very different from the American system, which leaves 37 million people uncovered.
The main difference between the German system and the American one is that most Germans have no choice about whether to join a health insurance plan, and no problem finding coverage, either. Unless they are either very poor or pretty well off, the law requires them to become members of one of 1,147 "sickness funds." Some funds are connected to private employers, while others are quasi-public institutions.
The funds are supposed to break even, and each one sets a monthly premium rate as a percentage of a wage-earner's monthly salary. The rates among the funds vary between 8 percent and 16.8 percent of salary, and have reached a historically high national average of 13.1 percent. The premiums are shared equally by employer and employee and paid by payroll deduction. The rate is the same for single and married wage-earners, with or without dependents, in any sickness fund.
"Everybody knows exactly how much health insurance costs, and when the figure climbed above 13 percent, everybody in the system knew they had to get costs under control or the public would be after them," said Uwe E. Reinhardt of Princeton University, an economist who is an expert on the German system.
Nearly all employers are required to participate, including small businesses and low-wage industries, which in the United States often say they cannot afford to offer benefits. The funds cover not only workers and employees but retirees and people on welfare. Government agencies pay the premiums for the elderlythe indigent and the unemployed. Changing jobs does not mean losing coverage.
Germans who have the basic, mandatory insurance never see their doctor or hospital bills. "All i had to do was fill out a health care coupon from my sickness fund and present it to the doctor," said Mrs. Marianne Wettlauffer, 68, who had a heart attack several years ago and also spent six weeks in a rehabilitation cure. All but a nomical amount was paid for by her fund.
Her husband, Hellmut, 68, also had a heart attack 10 years ago, while he was a Government employee. His current care, too, costs him nothing out of pocket, though he supplements his Government pension plan with an inexpensive private policy that provides additional benefits like private hospital rooms.
Their physician, Dr. Friedrichs, has a small practice in a modern building in Bad Godesberg. Dr. Friedrichs takes privately insured patients as well as those in the sickness funds. The Private patients bring in bigger fees, but the funds provide the bread and butter, with a minimum of administrative headache, she said.

HEADLINE: THE MEDICAL BUSINESS: EMPLOYERS;
Companies of All Sizes Tally Effects of Plan

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
President Clinton's plan for reshaping the health care system would cause a vast shift in financial burdens among American corporations. Health costs would ease for companies, most of them manufacturers, that now offer generous benefits, and rise for those that do not, among them not only small neighborhood shops but also corporate giants like Wal-Mart, Sears and Wendy's.
How those burdens would be reapportioned emerges from a look at insurance costs and prospects at four companies representing the variety of corporate experiences: Ford Motor Company, an older manufacturer; Apple Computer, a young high-tech company; Lehigh Valley Racquet and Fitness Centers, a small Pennsylvania business that uses part-time instructors, and Manpower Inc., the nation's biggest supplier of temporary workers. 
 Once the President's plan is in place, "the variation in burdens among firms is going to be much less," said Paul Starr, a senior White House adviser and an architect of the plan.
 
Favorable Glances
 For Ford, the Clinton plan holds out great promise of slowing the steady rise in the company's health care expenses. At last, Ford says, it will not have to pay a disproportionate share of the nation's medical bills, in effect picking up payments to treat the uninsured. What the company really wants, though, is to shift to the Government its huge outlay for retirees' health care, and the White House has not yet said how it would handle that issue.
Apple also looks favorably on the Clinton plan, which would set a national standard for health insurance that would cost the company less than it now pays for the same, or better, coverage.
But Manpower and Lehigh Valley Racquet are worried. Lehigh Valley Racquet pays nothing for its part-time employees' health coverage, and Manpower pays very little for its temporary workers. Under the Clinton plan, each company would have to contribute for those employees.
The uninsured employees at Lehigh and at Manpower are among the nearly 48 million workers -- nearly 40 percent of all employed Americans -- who hold jobs at companies that do not offer them health insurance, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute in Washington. While some of those workers are at small companies that say they cannot afford benefits, the majority are part-time or temporary workers at giant corporations.
Many of thosety workers are in fact insured, under a spouse's or parent's policy or a personal policy. The Clinton plan would have all employers share the cost of insuring their workers and their families, no matter what other arrangements an employee might have.
At present, Ford often pays for health insurance for the family of a worker, although the worker's spouse might work at a Wal-Mart or a Manpower. Under the Clinton plan, Ford's obligation would be reduced, while the spouse's employer would have to help pay for the family's coverage.
To hold down rising costs, Ford is drawing its workers to plans that are less expensive than the company's traditional fee-for-service coverage, in which a worker goes to a doctor of his choice and the Ford health plan pays the bill, whatever it might be. The less expensive plans, called preferred provider networks or health maintenance organizations, require workers to use groups of doctors and hospitals with whom the company has negotiated set fees.
Even with the migration to networks, Ford is paying more for health care -- $5,000 on average for each active and retired worker in 1992 -- than the Clinton plan would require for its standardized coverage, which is less comprehensive than Ford's.
What's more, while the Clinton plan would require an employer to pay at least 80 percent of the insurance premiums of its workers, Ford now picks up the entire bill.
When it comes to retirees, Ford has a problem. Apple Computer and many other nonunion companies founded in recent decades have no retirees yet, and no intention of giving them health insurance when they materialize. Ford, on the other hand, has 125,000 retirees, a number almost as large as the company's work force of 145,000. Both groups have the same coverage.
Robert L. Ozment, Ford's director of corporate and employee insurance, said the cost of retiree health care is currently more than $600 million a year, or 40 percent of Ford's total health cost. The Clinton plan offers to help pay insurance costs for retirees under 65 and ineligible for Medicare, which includes 38,000 Ford's retirees. For the first three years, however, it would levy a special tax on affected corporations to regain part of the windfall gain.
 
Where Choice Is Mandated at Apple
 The big effort at Apple has been to reduce the cost of company-sponsored health insurance for its 8,000 American workers. With the cost of premiums rising 18 percent a year, the computer company announced in 1987 that instead of having only one form of insurance, its employees would be able to choose from four types of plans, each involving a different cost to the employees and different levels of coverage.
Like most companies, Apple had relied for years on a fee-for-service health plan that paid 80 percent or more of medical costs after the employee and his or her family covered an annual deductible. The company now also offers two preferred provider networks in which employees are charged only small amounts for care, once a deductible is covered, as long as they stay within their networks. Apple also does business with three health maintenance organizations, which in effect provide full medical and hospital care at a fixed annual premium per employee.
H.M.O.'s offer the best opportunity for Apple to control costs. But the company, like most of corporate America, has been reluctant to force its employees into the cheapest plan. While 19 percent of Apple workers have joined an H.M.O., 49 percent have chosen one of the preferred provider plans. Partly as a result, the increase in Apple's annual health care costs fell to 12 percent last year and 10 percent so far this year, said Sally Gottlieb, benefits manager at Apple. That still remains a much steeper rise than the President's plan calls for.
The Clinton plan might also help Apple lower costs. A number of Apple employees -- the company will not say how many -- have working spouses but get their entire family coverage through Apple. In the formula the White House proposes for handling two-earner families, a spouse's employer would also have to pay. Each employer would pay 80 percent of a family premium for the Administration's standard coverage, or roughly $2,300 apiece. Apple now pays $3,600 a year, on average, for each worker's coverage.
For John F. Brinson, president of Lehigh Valley Racquet, costs would rise by what he considered an unbearable amount if Mr. Clinton's plan was adopted. He distinguished between voluntarily deciding to let his 121 part-time employees participate in the company's plan at their expense -- a step he said he would consider -- and being ordered to do so by the Government at Government- mandated rates.
Forty people work full-time at the company's fitness centers in Allentown and Bethlehem; they are the administrators, clerks and maintenance workers. For each, Mr. Brinson pays $1,200 a year toward the cost of his company's group policies, either fee for service or H.M.O. But at Government-mandated premiums of $2,300 for family coverage, Mr. Brinson would almost double his cost for employees with families, while adding $600 a year for those who are single.
Many of his full-time employees earn less than $24,000 a year, and below that level the Government, under the Clinton plan, would subsidize part of the premium expense. Such subsidies would also apply to the part-time employees.
No one would benefit more from the Clinton plan than the nation's nearly two million temporary workers, people who sign up with agencies like Manpower. The Manpower rate for renting out the "temp" covers the wage -- averaging $8.50 an hour -- plus a sum paid to the Government for workmen's compensation, plus an amount to cover Manpower's costs and profit. The temporary agencies will now have to add another sum for health insurance.
"It is devastating economics," said Douglas Long, director of compensation and benefits at Norrell Services, an Atlanta-based "temp" agency. "Ultimately it will force us to raise our rates by 7 to 9 percent." Manpower pays all or most of the cost of the health insurance that it makes available to its 6,000 permanent employees. But the "temps" get no help, except for a small percentage who work 400 hours over 10 weeks.
But Michael Fromstein, Manpower's chairman says "We are supporting the reform effort." He said all the temporary-help companies faced the same new costs.

HEADLINE: THE PROBLEMS: THE SICK;
Catch-22: Lose Health, Lose Policy

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA

 BODY:
In a new practice, some health insurance companies are starting to divide the sick from the well, even in large groups that were once a bastion of security in a tumultuous industry.
Families in large groups had always felt that if they had been part of the group for at least six months or a year, their medical costs would be covered and their premiums would remain stable. But now, some insurance companies are dramatically raising rates for sick people, and even for people they think may become sick. 
The result, said Dr. Norman Daniels, an ethicist at Tufts University who is an expert on health insurance, is that "no one in this country with private health insurance coverage who is in any kind of group plan is free from the kind of uncertainty that competition is producing." He added, "We are beginning to see that people who have the greatest access to health care in this country are at risk."
 
$16,000 Annual Premium
 No one knows how common it is for insurance companies to raise the rates for the sick in large groups, which usually consist of employees at big corporations or members of special-interest organizations. But the experience of Kathleen Renshaw of Leucadia, Calif., and others shows that the problem, once thought to be limited to small groups, is spreading to large groups as well.
Ms. Renshaw finally admitted defeat in her struggle to keep group health insurance for her family when the annual premium reached $16,000 a year. Her problem is her 8-year-old daughter, Marisa, an exuberant child who swims on a team and takes singing lessons.
Who Is at Risk?
But Marisa has only one kidney, and it does not fully function. She needs regular checkups and may face kidney failure in the future. When the family's insurance company learned of the problem, which doctors discovered when Marisa was 3, it began doubling the family's health insurance premiums each year, the maximum increase allowed by California law.
Finally, the family could no longer pay. And no other company would insure them. Along with Marisa, Ms. Renshaw, her husband, William Harvey, and their 4-year-old daughter, Kirsten, who has no medical problems, were out in the cold even though they had been part of a large group with health insurance.
Ms. Renshaw and Mr. Harvey bought group the insurance through the alumni association at the University of California at San Diego, and they always paid their premiums. "I thought that when you pay insurance, the insurance companies will pay for you when you get sick," Ms. Renshaw said. It was a shock to learn otherwise, she said.
Dr. Donald Light, a sociologist who is professor of health policy at the University of Medicine and Denistry of New Jersey, said the family's experience was "a tragic example of the spiral of exclusion that is spreading through the entire health care industry."
The Renshaw family fell victim to a practice that Dr. Light calls policy churning. Each year, the company would raise its rates. At the same time, it invited its members to reapply for an attractive low rate for new subscribers. But people who were sick or had a pre-existing condition were turned down for the lower rate when they reapplied, forcing them to accept whatever rate the company would impose.
Until recently, Dr. Light said group insurance programs until recently covered any member who became ill. The costs for the sick people were spread over the entire group. But the new practice changes the rules so that group members who become sick or, the company suspects, may become sick, have to pay much more for their coverage.
Dr. Light said the practice began in small groups, like self-insured small businesses, in the mid- to late 1980's. While it is still most common in small groups, he said, it is spreading to larger and larger groups. The group that Ms. Renshaw and Mr. Harvey joined had thousands of members.
Dr. Daniels said practices that weed out the sick are the insurance industry's way of remaining competitive by selling insurance at low rates to people who are well. "What's really at work are a set of economic factors," he said. Insurers realize that people who are healthy will shop around for the lowest rates they can get, so insurers have to compete with each other to attract this healthy, income-generating group. The sicker people, however, cannot shop around because no other company will take them or will charge them rates at least as high as they are currently paying. So, Dr. Daniels said, "insurers have underwriting procedures to sort people out."
 The administrator of the alumni group insurance, Association Consultants Inc. of Chicago, said that the group had offered attractive low rates to new subscribers, forcing members of the group to reapply regularly or pay much more. But, said William Richard Floyd, the vice president of Association Consultants, the group had no recourse. "The greatest fear any plan has is that new applicants will stop coming in," he said. "If you stop that flow, the plan will terminate because of poor experience."
 Dr. Uwe Reinhardt, an economist at Princeton University, said the insurance problems that beset Ms. Renshaw's family were a graphic example of why he calls the American system health "unsurance" rather than health insurance. He added that these problems show why health care had become a potent national issue.
Ms. Renshaw said that she and her husband purchased their insurance after Marisa was born. Mr. Harvey, who is self-employed in the construction industry, had no employer to offer insurance and neither did Ms. Renshaw, who until recently worked as a photographer and is now a substitute teacher.
Marisa, however, was not a healthy baby. She failed to gain weight as she should have and no one knew why. Finally, when Marissa was 3, her doctor discovered that she had just one kidney and it had been permanently damaged by a urinary tract infection.
A year later, the family's insurance premiums started to escalate. In two increases over the course of the year, the rate soared from $1,552 a year to $5,080 a year. The company did say, however, that Ms. Renshaw and Mr. Harvey could reapply for insurance and, if accepted, get a lower rate. They applied and were rejected, meaning they were stuck with the soaring rates. "That was how they separated the sick people from the well people," Ms. Renshaw said.
To reduce their premiums, Mr. Harvey dropped out of the program and went uninsured. That brought the premium to $3,160 a year.
But the next year, in February 1989, the rate was increased again to $4,420 a year. In February 1990, it rose to $8,844 a year, payable quarterly. "We made two of those payments, but it was getting to the point where our health insurance was as much as our mortgage," Ms. Renshaw said. Then, she said, she got a telephone call from the company saying it was raising the rate to $16,000 a year.
In desperation, Ms. Renshaw tried calling her alumni association but, she said, they offered no help and, "eventually they stopped returning my calls.' She said she also called members of the California Assembly. "They said, 'That's too bad. You should start a grass roots petition,' " she recalled.
Ms. Renshaw and Mr. Harvey tried to find another company to insure the family, but none would. The best they could do was get minimal coverage for their daughters. They said they were told by the companies that they could get coverage for the family if Marisa's kidney was excluded, but the cost of paying for all of Marisa's sonograms and checkups for her kidney as well as the health insurance premiums would reach at least $7,000 a year which they could not afford.
Through a catastrophic health insurance plan of the California Children Services, Marisa is now covered for major problems with her kidney, but nothing else. And this coverage, Ms. Renshaw said, is available only if a family of four has an income of $40,000 or less. But if Ms. Renshaw gets a full-time teaching job, which she has been seeking, the family would be disqualified by its income. In that case, she said, "our next option is a divorce."
 Kirsten is covered by an individual Blue Cross policy with a $1,500 deductible. But the policy excludes payments for her sinuses, because she has had two sinus infections. And it will not cover any problems with her eyes because Ms. Renshaw once took her to an opthalmologist, mistakenly thinking that her eyes were crossed.
Ms. Renshaw said her search for insurance has led her to get a teaching certificate, rather than one in marriage and family counseling, which she preferred, because she does not want to be self-emplyed. As a teacher, she reasoned, she would have a chance of getting insurance though the school system. And she has is putting off having a baseline mammogram until after she gets insurance for the family, afraid that if the mammogram detects any suspicious lumps in her breast, she would fail to get insurance.
As she applies for a teaching position, Ms. Renshaw said that she is afraid to mention Marisa's kidney problem. "I might not get a job," she said.
And she and her husband live in terror of illness because medical bills could easily bankrupt them. "I'm afraid we'll lose our house," Ms. Renshaw said. "That's the only thing we have."

Soaring Costs for Health Care Touch Off Service Cuts and Fees

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH

DATELINE: TORONTO

 BODY:
Canada's 27-year-old universal health insurance system, in which most medical bills are paid by Government tax money and hospital budgets and doctor's fees are regulated, faces exploding costs. One response has been to get individuals and employers to pick up more of the bill.
Canadians are proud of a system that generally provides good medical care to all its citizens at a lower cost than in the United States -- averaging 1,915 American dollars per person in 1991, the latest year for which figures are available, compared with $2,868 in the United States. But spending in recent years has grown nearly as fast as in the United States, and is outstripping the ability of the public sector to pay. 
 Despite new efforts to control costs, from cutbacks in covered services to caps on doctors' fees and hospital budgets, "revenues in the public sector are not increasing fast enough," said Bill Tholl, director of health policy at the Canadian Medical Association.
Aggravating the financial distress has been Canada's most painful recession since the Great Depression, which has compressed tax receipts and cut federal transfer payments to the 10 provinces and 2 territories, which actually run the health system for Canada's 27 million people.
The federal Government used to pay half of the health system costs. Now it is down to 30 percent. As a result, the provinces have been forced into ever larger deficits to finance health care, which consumes about a third of their total spending.
No one wants to dismantle the most popular Canadian social program. But there is talk of changing some of the ground rules.
Fees Are Debated For example, fees have been widely discussed, even though they would contravene the Canada Health Act of 1984, which reaffirmed the fundamental principles of universal access to comprehensive care, unimpeded by financial barriers.
 While opinion surveys show that more than half of Canadians would support patient fees as the best way to control health costs, opponents have successfully resisted, arguing that the practice would polarize rich and poor and require cumbersome administrative machinery.
Reducing covered services, another approach to shifting the burden to users, has made greater headway. The Ontario Health Insurance Plan, as Mr. Holmes found, has reduced fees to commercial laboratories and allows them to bill patients directly. Ontario, which insures 10 million people or nearly 40 percent of Canada's population, has cut costs in these other ways:
 * It stopped payment for certain services in connection with employment, insurance, pensions, legal proceedings, recreation and education. For example, if a worker needs a physical to get a job, he must pay for it.
* It ended coverage of electrolysis, used for the removal of unwanted hair, sometimes the result of a hormonal disorder, and reviewing coverage of 40 other items including psychoanalysis, vasectomies, newborn circumcision, in vitro fertilization and chiropractic, podiatric and osteopathic services.
* It increased patient payments for drug prescriptions covered by the Ontario Drug Benefit Plan, which chiefly serves people over 65.
Beyond the unavoidable price of new medical technology, the explosion in Canadian health costs has been encouraged, many analysts say, by an oversupply of doctors and the fee-for-service system that rewards them for seeing more patients and doing more procedures.
In 1964 there was one doctor for every 800 people in Canada; today there is one for every 450. Growth has been almost comparable in the United States, where in 1965 the ratio was one for every 720 persons compared with one for 411 now. After weighing the higher costs in the United States, including malpractice insurance premiums, which are 10 times stiffer, incomes of Canadian doctors are close to American levels.
Doctor's fee schedules are negotiated between each provincial government and its medical association. After treating a patient, the doctor bills the provincial health authority according to the fee schedule. For example, if a doctor in this province makes a house call between 5 P.M. and midnight or on weekends he may bill for $71. In Quebec, a simple consultation by a general practitioner costs the Quebec insurance plan $13.18, and $50.80 for a complete examination.
 Also keeping costs up is the tendency for hospital stays to be long, at least longer than in the United States.

HEADLINE: YOUR HOME;
Settling Disputes In-House

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

 BODY:
IT is tough to get along with neighbors. That is especially true in a condominium, co-op or homeowner association where the ephemera of daily life -- from the weight of a pet to the planting of petunias -- is tightly regulated.
Little wonder that disputes between neighbors and residents and their associations have been a source of friction for years. 
 Until recently the parties could take their differences directly to court, where they could fight as long and hard as they wanted if they had the resources.
Now, however, they are increasingly being forced by state or local laws to take such disputes to mediation or arbitration before the courts will consider the cases.
New Jersey is a case in point. Since July, the state has required condominium, co-op and homeowner associations to set up internal mechanisms for the resolution of disputes between unit owners and their associations or between one unit owner and another. There are similar arrangements in Florida and in Montgomery County, Md., among other places. New York and Connecticut do not yet have such requirements.
"The courts were clogged with these cases," said E. Richard Kennedy, a partner with the law firm of Kennedy & Imbriani in Montville, N.J., who specializes in community association law. "And unit owners didn't have an early or effective method of resolving their differences in a more economical way."
Not that they would have done so unless required by law. History has shown that given the opportunity to go directly to court, virtually everyone will do so -- the reason more jurisdictions are saying, in effect, enough is enough.
But do these initiatives hold greater promise than those tried in the past and discarded? Not necessarily. The Council for Homeowner Rights, an umbrella group of disgruntled residents in the Washington area, is determined to lobby against the trend. "Many of these cases involve constitutional issues, such as the right to levy fines," said William Thomson, the president of the council. "When you use an alternative forum you also give up your rights to appeal."
While it is clearly too soon to evaluate the outcome of the New Jersey law, it is driving the parties toward new approaches.
Michael Pesce, the president of the Community Management Corporation of Clifton, N.J., which manages more than 80 communities, said it was forcing associations to get more actively involved in mediating unit-owner disputes. "We used to say, 'Don't get in the middle because you'll end up with two enemies,' " he said. Now associations must provide forums and are forced to mediate.
The experience in Montgomery County also provides guidance. In January 1991, it became one of the first jurisdictions to require that these disputes go before a three-member arbitration panel immediately after one party in a dispute requests intervention by the county's Office of Common Ownership Communities. The decision of the panel can be appealed to the courts only on limited technical grounds.
Since the inception of the dispute-solving mechanism, 152 cases have been filed, more than half of which have been settled by the office's mediators, before the panel convened. There is no charge for the mediation and arbitration services, which are financed by an annual fee of $1.50 from each unit owner in the county.
TOM SCHILD, a partner in the law firm of Silverman & Schild in Silver Spring, Md., who specializes in condominium law, said he saw room for improvement. He argues that because such hearings are free, and there is no need for legal representation, the system encourages people to fight rather than settle differences informally.
To keep the number of filings in check, he said, the professional staff should be given the right to dismiss frivolous complaints that clearly fall within the discretion of a board and could not be construed as unfair or discriminatory.
He noted a recent case where an association decided to put a bicycle rack on common ground. One unit owner filed for a hearing with the commission, contending that the rack hurt her view. "It may have seemed offensive," he said, "but it was clearly permissible." But the arguments dragged on for more than four hours before the decision was rendered in favor of the association.
An official report by the county on the first two years of the program, published last spring, offered improvements. It suggested instituting a filing fee of $25 to $50 to deter frivolous complaints, using a single hearing officer instead of the three-member panel to make more hearing officers available and empowering the agency to fine those who do not comply with decisions.
The approach in Florida has been tougher, but evidently successful. Since April 1992 Florida has required such disputes to be heard initially by a state arbitrator. If neither party files for a hearing in court within 30 days of the arbitrator's decision it becomes legally binding. There are also financial disincentives to going to court. Of the 380 petitions filed, only 10 have gone to court.
"It does appear effective," said Karl Scheuerman, the chief attorney for the program in Tallahassee. But he said he feared that when the requirement was only mediation -- as in New Jersey -- the parties would still seek their day in court.
Changing the procedures that are used to write internal rules is being promoted as a further way to decrease costs.
James P. Curry, a partner with the law firm of Curry, Taylor & Carls in Orlando, Fla., said that too often the rules were flawed. "Most rules are written by a group of volunteers who don't get much input from their neighbors," he said.
True, the boards or associations may have the legal right to make the changes or additions without first seeking the approval of the residents. Even so, he said, they should hold an open session to which everyone is invited. "That way you find out pretty quickly if something isn't going to work," he said.
And every community could probably benefit by appointing a special committee to review the existing rules and procedures and bring its recommendations to an open meeting. Not only would it refresh everyone's memory about the need for certain rules, but it would also generate support for compliance. "Whenever there's consensus," Mr. Curry said, "a rule is less likely to be broken."
More information on the subject is in "Strategies for Successful Enforcement of Rules and Deed Restrictions," by F. Scott Jackson and David G. Barratti, 1992 edition, a 24-page book published by the Community Associations Institute. The cost of the book is $15.95 for individuals, and less for CAI members and bulk sales.

HEADLINE: PERSPECTIVES;
An Investment Firm Gives Its Regard to Broadway

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
LOOKING westward from his office window, James Allwin has a clear view of 1585 Broadway, the three-year-old skyscraper on the west blockfront from 47th to 48th Street. He is head of the real estate group at Morgan Stanley Group, the global financial services firm, and he salts his speech with expressions relished by financiers:
"The question was, 'Should we go long on New York City?" ' 
 Morgan Stanley went long on New York in general and Times Square in particular last August when it submitted the winning bid of $176 million for 1585 Broadway, a 42-story building with 1.34 million gross square feet of space.
The company will occupy 1 million square feet; the rest is already occupied by the law firm of Proskauer Rose Goetz & Mendelsohn under a long-term lease. Outfitting its space, which includes five huge floors at the base for trading activities, is likely to cost Morgan Stanley at least $175 million, trade sources say.
At the time of the sale, attention focused on the price, which was well above the $150 million minimum set by the consortium of banks that took over the project from the developer, Solomon Equities. The price was higher than some insiders had expected, although for a buyer able to use the space the price was considered highly favorable. The seller was a consortium of eight banks, with Hines Interests Limited Partnership as real-estate advisor.
For New York City, rooting Morgan Stanley in West Midtown as a property owner-user must be looked on as a triumph. It validates the Times Square area as a location for financial-services activity, the vision David S. Solomon was unable to convert to reality amid retrenchments as the 80's wore on.
With Bertelsman A.G., the German media company, having purchased the newly built 1540 Broadway at 45th Street for occupancy, the Times Square district gets still another sizable corporation as an owner-user.
The economic impact is also substantial. Morgan Stanley employs about 4,000 people in the city, generates tax revenue one way or another of about $100 million a year, and produces a direct and indirect economic impact of about $3 billion a year, according to the city's Economic Development Corporation. That includes salaries, taxes and other direct expenses, plus the business activity it generates.
Helping Morgan Stanley make the purchasing decision was the package of tax incentives it negotiated with New York City at a time when it was hedging its bets by optioning land for possible new construction in Stamford, Conn.
The firm's major lease of 600,000 square feet in 1251 Avenue of the Americas -- a building owned by Mitsui Fudosan (New York), and managed by Rockefeller Center -- expires in 1998.
That $39 million package was conceived before the purchase as a 10-year benefit to keep Morgan Stanley in Manhattan and Brooklyn, where it has computer space, at least that long, countering the overtures from Connecticut.
It was linked with the firm's plan at the time to renew its lease at 1251 Avenue of the Americas for five years, until the year 2002, when other Morgan Stanley leases in midtown buildings expire. In accordance with an understanding with the Dinkins administration that the offer would be improved if Morgan Stanley made a longer-term commitment, the package is now being renegotiated, reportedly to provide a benefit of roughly $80 million over 20 years.
These negotiations call attention to the key role tax-benefit packages have had to play in New York's efforts to hold major employers in the face of competing government-backed developments in neighboring states and beyond.
Another more recent package involved $31 million in long-term benefits to Kidder, Peabody & Company, currently downtown and planning to move to Rockefeller Center.
As long as the city's tax structure is obliged to support huge payroll costs and generous public services, and is skewed to blunt the strain on homeowners and regulated renters, special incentives are needed to bolster the employment base.
FINANCIAL-SERVICE concerns -- including banks and insurance companies as well as investment firms and brokerages -- are a key part of that tax base. Data from Cushman & Wakefield, the real-estate services firm, show that these concerns accounted for 5.3 million square feet, or 6.5 percent, of office occupancy in the midtown area last year and 18.8 million square feet, or 32.5 percent, of downtown occupancy.
Tenants downtown typically pay $6 to $7 a square foot per year in property taxes in Class A office buildings. New York City also imposes on commercial tenants a 6 percent rent tax, in addition to its sales tax of 8 1/4 percent and higher electric-power costs than in neighboring states.
Across the river in Jersey City, office users in new buildings make a payment in lieu of taxes that typically gives them a fixed tax cost of $2 to $2.50 a square foot a year over 15 or 20 years. Most of the new buildings are also in designated urban enterprise zones, where tenants pay no sales or wage taxes.
Tenants typically pay a total of $5.50 to $6 a square foot per year for operating costs and taxes, according to Kurt Eichler, regional vice president of LCOR Inc., the developer of the 1.5-million-square-foot 101 Hudson Street project in Jersey City. That is approximately what operating costs alone total in New York. Among others induced to move operations to 101 Hudson Street is Lehman Brothers, which is taking 340,000 square feet and 900 back-office jobs. Earlier, Merrill Lynch took 600,000 square feet and 2,500 jobs.
Under Gov. Jim Florio, New Jersey has even brought the weight of state government to bear as an equity investor in private development. The one-million-square-foot Newport Tower project in Jersey City has the benefit of a $10 million equity investment from the state, derived from a bond issue backed by revenue from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The money comes through the New Jersey Economic Development Authority and is used to offset the cost of tenant improvements and to improve building technology.
Newport Tower is jointly owned by The Limited, the Columbus, Ohio, clothing chain that at one time thought it would occupy half the building for an Eastern regional headquarters, and the Georgetown Group, a Manhattan real-estate investment firm. It had no tenants at all last year until First Chicago Trust, a midtown tenant, signed on for 240,000 square feet.
More recently Brown Brothers Harriman & Company, a lower Manhattan tenant, agreed to take 106,000 square feet.
"NEW YORK needs a long-term strategy," said Meyer S. Frucher, executive vice president of Olympia & York U.S.A., which alone owns and manages 17 million square feet of space in New York, much of it downtown. "There must be tax reduction in an orderly and systematic way," he said.
It also may be that Governor-elect Christine Todd Whitman will choose not to use revenue from the Port Authority to subsidize office buildings to the competitive disadvantage of New York City.
As for Morgan Stanley, the widely held view in real-estate circles is that it won itself a highly advantageous deal in the purchase of 1585 Broadway. It paid $130 a square foot for the space -- perhaps about half what it would cost to build new. Its occupancy costs will be lowered by the value of the Proskauer Rose lease and prospective rents from advertising signs and retail space at the base of the building.
Floors two through six will be used for trading by Morgan Stanley's equities, fixed-income, foreign exchange and commodities departments. "The real thing that sent those businesses into heaven was the layout, with the elevators at the back," said Carter McClelland, head of finance, administration and operations at Morgan Stanley. "There's a huge line of sight."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property:/Around West 34th Street;
A High-Traffic, Low-Rent Lure

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
ANN M. ARBUTHNOT, a senior vice president of J. Baker, gives a one-word rationale for why her Canton, Mass. company opened two Parade of Shoes stores on West 34th Street this year: "People."
So why not 57th Street and Fifth Avenue, or one of New York's other busy retail areas? Again, a one-word answer: "Rents." 
 She will elaborate if you insist: Parade of Shoes, which sells all its shoes for $19.98, cannot support the $250-a-square foot it can cost to be on Fifth or Madison Avenues. But it does well in high-traffic areas, and 34th Street, with its mix of tourists, Penn Station commuters and Madison Square Garden customers, certainly is that.
The chain has more than 150 stores, and the two on 34th Street are already vying for top spot on its list of those with the highest gross -- and at a "good rent" at that.
"I just wish we had come here sooner," Ms. Arbuthnot said.
A lot of people are feeling that way about the West 34th Street area. New Spectrum Realty says that from July 1992 to July 1993, there was a drop of more than 21 percent in the amount of retail space available on 34th Street from Fifth to Eighth Avenue. Only four of the street's 116 storefronts are vacant, and brokers doubt they will be for long.
"This has got to be the busiest shopping street in Manhattan," said Benjamin Fox, a partner at New Spectrum.
Office space is going fast, too. The Edward S. Gordon Company says that, as of Nov. 1, vacancies in the areas surrounding West 34th Street -- say, the stretch from 31st to 42d Street and from Sixth to Eighth Avenue -- were only 14 percent, compared with 15.2 percent for all of midtown.
"This area used to be where you went if you couldn't afford someplace else," said Lee N. Feld, a managing director at Edward S. Gordon, who manages 1250 Broadway, on 32d Street. "Now it attracts tenants on its own."
Examples abound. Five Penn Plaza, on Eighth Avenue near 34th Street, has just one floor available; 18 months ago the 24-story building was half empty. Turnover at the Empire State Building, which has a lot of small-space tenants, has been high in this recession, yet the 102-story building is again 90 percent full. Not only does the old Ohrbachs department store building at 7 West 34th Street have two clothing stores, Limited Express and Structure, at street level, but its 12 upper floors are now home to Fairchild Publications and the Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York.
Local landlords are ecstatic. "This area is on a roll," said Peter L. Malkin, a part owner of the Empire State Building, of One Penn Plaza (atop Penn Station) and of the Children's Wear building, 112 West 34th.
Economics, of course, has a lot to do with it. Brokers say that space in Class A office buildings in the Penn Plaza area is averaging about $20 to $23 a square foot, about $2 or $3 more than in comparable buildings below, say, 32d Street, but $3 to $5 less than comparable buildings near Grand Central Terminal. Retail rents on 34th Street go from $90 to $160 a square foot, depending on store size.
"Penn Plaza has carved out a niche as the top end of Midtown South," observed Michael Cohen, president of Williams Real Estate.
Nowhere is the resurgence more visible than on 34th Street. Over the last two decades, as Ohrbach's, Franklin Simon, Gimbels and B. Altman's closed, the area turned into a haven for small stores of the perennially going-out-of-business variety, or for apparel stores that sold cheap goods even cheaper.
"IT was a street of layaway shopping, where people paid $10 a week toward things they took home months later," said C. Bradley Mendelson, a senior managing director and retail broker at Edward S. Gordon.
Developers, with financing from Ferdinand E. Marcos, failed miserably nine years ago, when they tried to replicate the feel -- and price -- of Madison and Fifth Avenues and other high-end retail areas at Herald Center, their 10-story mall in the former Korvette's on 34th Street and Broadway.
Now the center, which Morris Bailey and his partners bought in 1990 and which filed for bankruptcy last January, has gone the value-price route. Toys 'R' Us and Kids 'R' Us, among the first value-price tenants, just took more space. Daffy's, also an off-price retailer, contracted for four floors. Business is so good that most brokers expect the center to emerge from bankruptcy soon.
The area clearly has become more pleasant for shoppers and tenants alike. Thanks to the 34th Street Partnership, local streets are being cleaned more often, signs that are too large or too glaring are being removed by the partnership, and the police are cracking down on sidewalk vendors; since July that has included those selling printed material from tables, a group that was once exempt from a city ordinance barring sidewalk vendors from major retail thoroughfares.
Herald Square and Greeley Square are floodlit at night and taxi stations are better supervised. Mr. Malkin, a cofounder of the partnership, expects that reported crime by the end of 1993 will be 20 percent lower than it was two years ago.
The area still has a way to go before it looks like upper Fifth or Madison, though. The former B. Altman's, which anchors 34th Street to the east, still has no tenant for its Fifth Avenue side (much of its Madison Avenue side will be used for a public library). The association has sued to get the five-story Levi's jeans sign removed from the side of 22 West 34th. And there are still lots of quasi-bazaars operating on 34th Street, selling everything from perfume to electronics from unenclosed storefronts and sidewalk racks.
"Building owners can collect huge rents for tiny spaces without whipping anything into shape," complained Elizabeth M. Rodgers, a retail real estate consultant who has been active in the partnership.
Still, the clean-up has been enough to attract some powerhouse retailers. The Gap has two stores and is expanding. Conway and The Limited have several stores in the area. Thom McCann is about to open its second 34th Street store. A national videogame company, cognizant that some 2 million people a year visit the Empire State Building observatory, will soon offer a computer-simulated tour of New York in a 10,000-square-foot spot in the building, with the proviso that tickets be sold at the Observatory ticket desk.
"Retailers have finally recognized that the loss of the carriage trade and the introduction of a lot of low-end retailers hasn't changed the buying power on this street," said Mr. Fox of New Spectrum.
Many of the area's larger office buildings are poised to cash in on the retailing renaissance. One Penn Plaza, for one, has earmarked $25 million for redoing its plazas and retail concourses, in good part to coincide with the higher traffic it expects when new entrances to the Long Island Rail Road station are opened nearby. Plans include several new restaurants, most with outdoor seating, in the plazas, and some apparel and gourmet food shops in the concourse.
Mr. Malkin says retailers are already clamoring to get in after the leases of existing stores expire, even though he will be asking $60 to $100 a square foot for concourse retailing space that now goes for about $50.
The proximity to the garment district, which stretches from about 35th to 42d Street, primarily along Seventh Avenue, has had a good impact on Penn Plaza buildings as well. According to Stuart I. Romanoff, a director at Cushman & Wakefield, about half of the Penn Plaza office deals were garment-district-related this year. Mr. Romanoff's client, Congress Talcott, a garment industry factor, took 42,000 square feet at 393 Seventh Avenue, on 32d Street, when its lease at 1633 Broadway, near 51st Street, expired this year. The simple reason: The Penn Plaza space was cheaper.
"They wanted to be walking distance from their clients, and this was just as close from the other direction," Mr. Romanoff said.
As the garment industry continues its slow crawl back from recession, the overflow may be even greater. Sidney Winoker of Winoker Realty, which manages many garment-district buildings, says that a lot of new apparel companies -- particularly Asian-owned ones -- are moving into space that troubled companies vacated over the last few years. The net result is that the glut of showroom and office space is diminishing.
"I can't say the area has turned around, but it certainly has stabilized," he said.

HEADLINE: County Is First to Add Environment to Its Charter

BYLINE: By TOM CALLAHAN

 BODY:
WESTCHESTER has become the first county in the country to adopt an environmental code of conduct based on 10 principles drawn up after the Exxon Valdez accident in 1989 by the Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies.
The principles cover many concerns, ranging from protection of the biosphere to energy conservation and waste disposal through recycling. 
 The principles also stress careful use of natural resources, minimizing environmental health risks to employees, eliminating the use of products that damage the environment, informing the public of conditions that might harm the environment and providing yearly reports.
Under legislation signed by County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke late last month, the County Charter was amended to include protection of the environment as a county purpose.
Mr. O'Rourke said that the code "publicly affirms our belief that local governments have a responsibility for the environment."
"We are formally and forever committing that Westchester County will conduct its affairs as a responsible steward of the environment," he added. "These sweeping principles will govern the actions of each and every department of the Westchester County government."
Mr. O'Rourke said that the county already adheres to the principles in day-to-day operations by, for example, developing energy-conservation systems for county office buildings and reducing the use of fertilizers on public golf courses.
The Charter change establishes a Council for Environmental Coordination to evaluate the county's environmental performance every year. The council will consist of 11 voting members, 4 of whom will be private citizens and 7 of whom will be drawn from various boards. The council will be staffed by a full-time executive director with cabinet rank. The first council will be appointed by Mr. O'Rourke on Jan. 1.
Richard A. Flynn, a Republican-Conservative member of the Board of Legislators from Mount Kisco and chairman of the Board's Committee on the Environment, said, "I think this law sends a message that this county is going to be active and responsible in protecting the environment."
The principles of the Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies have so far been adopted by 70 corporations. The Boston-based coalition has more than 20 members, among them the Sierra Club, Friends of the Earth, the National Wildlife Federation and the National Audubon Society.
While designed to cover business and corporate behavior, the principles can also apply to governments, said Jack Doyle, a member of the coalition's board of directors.
"County governments often operate like businesses in their purchasing," Mr. Doyle said. "There are 3,000 counties in the country. If each follows the lead of Westchester, it will have a significant positive impact on the environment." TOM CALLAHAN

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
As Sutton Said, It's Where The Money Is

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
IN AN overly warm New York conference room last week, Trevor Manuel was trying to persuade investors to put money into South Africa. A senior official of the African National Congress, he is widely expected to hold a top economic job when majority rule comes to that country next spring.
Mr. Manuel, a former community organizer who was classified as colored, or mixed-race, under apartheid, and who spent time in prison, said all the things the assembled money managers wanted to hear. He talked of making it easy for investors to repatriate their dividends and profits, of understanding the need for good profits, of a determination to end the country's harsh exchange controls. He understood the need for fiscal restraint. 
 It may not be an easy sell. For there is still fear about political violence, and worry that the A.N.C.'s determination to bring economic justice will make investors uncomfortable. Antitrust policy appears to be a high priority, as Mr. Manuel talks of breaking up the big conglomerates that control both banking and major industries.
But whatever his prospects for success, his presence at Merrill Lynch's headquarters last week spoke volumes about how the world has changed. Governments can print money, but throughout the world they can't get enough of it. More than ever before, the ability of capital to flee across national boundaries has shifted power away from governments and toward money managers and corporations. Last week money managers could also hear presentations from the Turkish Government or, at the same time the South Africans were making their push, learn of the bargains being made available as Italy sells off its state industries. Tomorrow the president of the Philippines will be in town extolling the virtues of the Manila market.
Perhaps the defining fact of the world in the 1990's is the excess of capital. That has driven down interest rates and spurred stock markets around the world as traders searched for growth. Manila has almost doubled this year.
But governments, which once seemed rich, now feel poor. Budget deficits are high, but so is resistance to spending cuts or tax increases. Washington talks of "no-money diplomacy" and the African National Congress knows full well that it must promise profits, not seek sympathy, if it is to get a capital inflow.
That reality underlies the vicious trade disputes, both here and in Europe. The emerging economies are successfully fighting for business -- just try to buy a toy this Christmas that is not from China -- and the workers and bosses of the fading First World industries are angry. Yet initiatives to liberalize trade, born when most economies were growing at a good clip, are now up for approval. That is why no new GATT deal is likely, and why Nafta is in trouble.
But even if Nafta dies this week, the trends are in place. Capital has largely escaped the control of governments, for better or worse. The winners will be those who best adapt to that reality.

HEADLINE: Boomtown U.S.A.

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN

DATELINE: BOISE, Idaho

 BODY:
TO see the winding rows of new houses sprouting in former potato fields, the massive new Town Square Mall stuffed with shoppers, the parade of joggers along the river that snakes through town, it is hard to believe that less than 10 years ago people were fleeing this area and its dead-end mining and farming economy.
Now, Boise leads the nation in job growth -- 6 percent last year -- and the city is in its sixth straight year of robust economic expansion. Construction permits are up 50 percent from 1991 -- the highest rate in the country. High-technology employment has leaped 57 percent since 1987, while crumbling in California and in New England. 
 With regular appearances on the list of the most livable cities in the nation and a sunny economic forecast stretching through the late 1990's, Boise has started to exude something close to smugness. The attractions for businesses and workers are impressive: median home price, under $100,000; average property tax, $415 a year in 1990; one of the lowest crime rates in the nation; average commute time, 17 minutes; not even one worker's compensation claim paid for stress in the whole city. Not to mention the mountains, the fresh air and the great weather.
Indeed, many people here now say they feel sorry for California, the state from which about 30 percent of all the newcomers here have fled.
It is a sentiment widely held across the Rocky Mountain West these days. . After a drawn-out recession in the mid-1980's, most of these states are on a roll, spurred by a new economy that is not as dependent on the boom-and-bust cycles of timber, mining and farming but is instead using attractions like those of Boise to land many new kinds of businesses that don't need an urban center in which to thrive. Three of the five fastest-growing states in the nation last year were Idaho, Nevada and Colorado. Not far behind are Arizona and two states whose eastern portions fall within this region, Oregon and Washington. Over the last two years, employment in the Rocky Mountain West has been growing nearly five times as fast as the national average.
But beneath this gloss is another story, one that raises the question of whether cities like Boise are a model for the 21st century, with a sustainable base of good jobs, or just low-wage exurbs of Southern California that will soon be overrun and suffer problems familiar to both coasts.
For one thing, anyone coming here looking for work and a piece of paradise will probably take a big drop in pay, if a job can be found at all. Idaho still ranks near the bottom in average wage and per-capita income. Even Hewlett-Packard and Micron Technology, the two largest employers and the companies that led Boise's shift to an economy based on the manufacture of high-technology products, start their workers at just over $7 an hour.
Also, the sharp growth is creating its own problems. Housing prices are soaring, repeating the pattern in California and later Seattle. And every new company and every new worker coming here may detract, in some small way, from the vaunted quality of life that brought them to begin with.
So far, however, southern Idaho's transformation from a high-unemployment backwater overly dependent on natural resources to a more diversified economy that has become a national leader in job growth has been a dramatic success.
In the early 1980's, the Rocky Mountain West was in a deep recession, as the oil, mining and timber industries contracted. Idaho, with just over a million people, saw its population shrink and had one of the highest unemployment rates in the country. From the Governor on down, state leaders sought to change things.
Boise, with its metropolitan-area population of 215,000, has in the past been dependent primarily on four large corporations: Albertsons, the grocery chain; Boise-Cascade, the timber giant; Morrison-Knudsen, the engineering and construction powerhouse, and J.R. Simplot, the agricultural giant.
But state officials wanted a wider base of employers. They commissioned a study to find out what kinds of businesses would benefit by moving to Idaho, then targeted more than a thousand companies in 35 industries.
Boise, the only real city in Idaho, began selling itself to out-of-state firms as a low-wage haven. Like other booming Rocky Mountain states, Idaho tells employers in California that they can do business here for less than half the cost of their present location.
Removed from the major markets, Idaho pitched other advantages as well: low taxes, lower expenses for worker's compensation, short commutes, cheap electric power, low land prices, an educated work force and little crime or traffic.
It is an attractive pitch, and in the last few years, about 130 companies have left California and other more urban areas to set up shop in Idaho.
 
Idaho as a Model
 Economists have held up Idaho's economy as something other states should try to emulate. "They haven't tried to hit the home run, to bring in the next I.B.M. or General Motors, but they've concentrated on bringing in the smaller companies, and that's where most of the job growth in this country is coming from," said Tracy Clark, an economist with Arizona State University.
Other Western cities, of similar size and circumstances, have been making the same pitch. They include Albuquerque and Santa Fe, N.M.; Salt Lake City; Spokane, Wash.; Colorado Springs, and Reno, Nev. Nevada, for example, ran a print advertisement in California, with a picture of traffic gridlock and the caption "5:35 P.M. California time," next to a picture of a business-suited father hugging his small daughter at home with the caption "5:35 P.M. Nevada time." The ad said, "Nevada time costs less because Nevada has no corporate, personal, unitary, franchise or inventory taxes."
Other states, particularly Arizona and Washington, have been more successful than Idaho at luring new companies, but no state has shown more job growth than this one.
 
California Emigrants
 From afar, particularly in Southern California, the pitch has hit home. This year, Harpers Inc., a furniture manufacturer, is moving from Torrance, in Southern California, to Post Falls, Idaho, bringing 500 jobs. Spur Products, the leading manufacturer of high-speed laser-printing interfaces, moved from El Segundo, also in Southern California, to Boise in 1991.
"Labor is cheaper and the work ethic is higher, so you get more bang for your buck," said Michael Hicks, a top official at Spur. "It boils down to the cost of doing business. Each sale we make is worth a lot more because our cost of doing business here is so much less."
Similarly, officials at Micron Technology, which employs about 5,000 people in Boise, have estimated that land prices here are one-sixteenth those in California's Silicon Valley.
Hewlett-Packard, which has 5,100 employees at its manufacturing base here, says quality of life was much more of an issue than cheap labor. "Really, for us, the big question is how happy our employees are, which makes for better productivity," said Mark Falconer, a spokesman for Hewlett-Packard in Boise, where laserjet printers are made for worldwide distribution. "A bunch of us were talking this morning about what a benefit it is to arrive at work and not be stressed out by some life-threatening activity from the night before or by the commute."
The company, with its headquarters in Palo Alto, Calif., has added 1,000 employees here in the last year. Even with the low starting salary for unskilled workers, applications are pouring in. Mr. Falconer said more than 10,000 had applied to work at the Boise plant in the last year.
Mr. Hicks said that when Spur Products was still in California, some of its employees made four-hour round-trip commutes every day. California's other ills have also contributed to Idaho's gain. "The Los Angeles riots created a lot of interest in Idaho," said Alan Porter, an analyst with the Idaho Department of Commerce.
The state now spends only $100,000 a year trying to lure new companies, and has virtually eliminated out-of-state recruiting trips. The word is out about Rocky Mountain states.
"People are coming here no matter what we say one way or the other," said Randy Shroll, the state's liaison with out-of-state companies.
But the flip side is less rosy. Mr. Shroll said he has started to warn people about the potential for disappointment. Although the unemployment rate in Ada County, which encompasses Boise, is only 4.5 percent, high-paying jobs are extremely scarce, officials say.
"A lot of people are quitting good, high-paying jobs to come here, but then they find out that there is nothing here for them," said Joy Hadley, assistant manager of a state job service center in Boise. "If you come here, you had better do so with the understanding that you might have to work at a fast-food store for a year or more just to put groceries on the table."
 
The Down Side

For all its stunning job growth -- the state has been at or near the top nationwide for three years -- Idaho still ranks near the bottom for per capita income and average wage, as do other Rocky Mountain boom states. The latest census figures, released last summer, put Idaho at 43d in per capita income, with an average of $16,067. Utah, Idaho's chief competitor in the effort to lure firms from the West Coast, ranks 49th.
Idaho officials attribute the low personal income figure primarily to large families, because of the heavy Mormon influence. Also, they point out that living is less expensive here, and that personal income is soaring; Idaho's rate is 7 percent, third best in the nation.
But state officials make no secret of the fact that they target companies that are looking to cut wages as the best way to increase profits. In that sense, Idaho can be viewed the way Mexico is in the current debate over a free-trade agreement. Their efforts also draw comparisons to the South and its low-wage attractions.
Such comparisons, some Western economists say, may be too harsh. "What the South was doing was trying to get low-skill assembly jobs," Mr. Clark said. "In Idaho, they are trying to attract assembly jobs, but the skill level is higher."
Idaho has more millionaires per capita than any other state, but the average wage here is $22,591 -- nearly 19 percent below the national average of $27,808. In brochures sent to firms in California, typically with 250 employees, Idaho officials say they can reduce a company's $7 million payroll by more than 50 percent without laying off a worker.
"We don't have land giveaways or tax-free offers like some states, but the low wages is a major selling point," said Mr. Porter, of the state commerce department.
Critics from California, which has just begun a major effort to fight back, and those who are skeptical here say the low-wage pitch will eventually backfire. Worse, it could set up Idaho as overly dependent on a certain kind of company -- the small to moderate-size high-tech manufacturer. From Phoenix to Torrance, Calif., the West is littered with empty office buildings and plants from boom times that were not supposed to end.
In an otherwise glowing report on the Idaho boom, analysts at Standard & Poor's in New York warned that Idaho should try to diversify its job base. Just as the Southern California economy deteriorated when aerospace declined, so could Idaho suffer if it becomes too tied to a certain industry, the analysts said. They noted that the state's healthy mix of home-grown companies, in food-processing and timber, may balance the newer reliance on high-tech.
 
The Consequences
 But a backlash against the new economy is growing here in Idaho, as in the other big-growth Rocky Mountain areas.
Paul Zelus, director of the Center for Business Research at Idaho State University in Pocatello, took issue with his state's low-wage economic strategy. "The wage levels here are below national standards by 20 to 40 percent, and that includes top management," he said. "It is an unwise strategy. It's anti-labor, and will cause problems."
One of the biggest growth areas for employment in the West has been low-paying jobs in credit-card processing; many are part-time, paying less than $10,000 a year. Some states, notably Arizona, have passed laws making it easy for banks to bring in these jobs.
Idaho business leaders counter that they are being selective about the kinds of businesses being wooed. They have discouraged telemarketing firms paying minimum wage and companies that would harm the environment. "We can't have economic success without preserving the foundations that make Idaho great -- our natural resources and environment," said Gov. Cecil Andrus, who helped lead Idaho to a new economy.
As for critics who think outsiders may be exploiting another natural resource -- the residents themselves -- Idaho officials are not worried.
"People who come in here thinking we just fell off the spud wagon will have a rude awakening," said Shirl Boyce, manager of the Boise Economic Development Council.
But others who live here are frightened by what they see. "Idaho right now is literally for sale," Mr. Zelus said. "We are being besieged by big banks and companies from California that want to buy whole mountainsides, whole towns, and convert them to something. That kind of growth scares a lot of people."
One consequence of the fast growth: The average home price in the Boise area rose nearly 10 percent in the last year, to $97,316.
Another consequence: The building boom has gotten so out of hand that the bedroom community of Meridian, its schools bursting at the seams, has ordered a moratorium on building. State projections call for a 50 percent increase in population by 2015, to 1.5 million people. The growth should be in a half-dozen smaller communities, close to recreation areas.
"Already, our quality of life has been compromised," Ms. Hadley said, "and maybe that's the price we've paid."
 
 
 
CALIFORNIANS DEFENDING THEIR TURF
 CALIFORNIA is fighting back against raids on its businesses by states in the Rocky Mountain West.
The Golden State -- having lost 700,000 jobs since 1990 -- nearly double the entire number of jobs in Idaho -- has formed TeamCalifornia, a group of public and private sector leaders, to try to keep companies from leaving.
If you don't like Southern California, these leaders tell companies, then try a little town in Northern California. Even the much-criticized worker's compensation system has been overhauled this year.
While California can't compete on labor or land costs, it is trying to streamline the issuance of building and environmental permits, and it boasts an educated work force and advanced infrastructure.
"When a company comes to us and says, 'We are being courted by out-of-state concerns,' we listen," said Julie Wright, California's Secretary of Trade and Commerce. "We are fed up with California-bashing, fed up to the point of taking action."

 BODY:

THE ECONOMY
 
Heeeere's Al! Heeeere's Ross! It's the Nafta Follies!
It was the television equivalent of historical fiction. The subject was serious, but it had "entertainment" written all over it. As entertainment it scored: Last week's Gore-Perot "chart wars" (as a White House aide labeled it) drew the largest audience ever for a scheduled cable program. The subject was the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Ross Perot has gleefully blasted, but kernels of serious debate were hard to spot amid the charts, pictures and what were generously called facts. After the dust cleared, the battle raged hotter than ever for lawmakers' hearts as this week's House vote neared.
 
Many Mexicans did not take kindly to Mr. Perot's depiction of a destitute country almost totally lacking in customers with enough money to buy American products. "Before he opens his mouth," a Mexico City lawyer said, "he ought to come down here and take a look." And one newspaper termed Mr. Perot's comments a "series of calumnies and lies."
 
Getting, Spending: A Balancing Act
Lawmakers, by and large, decide how this nation gets and spends. If getting doesn't keep up with spending, it's clear where to point fingers. But many lawmakers are saying, in effect, "We can't do it, so make us do it." That's what a balanced-budget amendment comes down to. The idea creates some odd Senate bedfellows -- Paul Simon, liberal stalwart, who favors more getting (taxes), and Orrin Hatch, conservative extraordinaire, who advocates less spending. Cries are getting louder for a vote, but last week, bowing to Thanksgiving, its backers put it off till February.
 
A Pass Is Just a Pass? No Way!
The debate heats up daily: Where, in that vast gray area between leer and lunge, does sexual harassment lie? Several Federal courts have ruled that lawsuits should show workplace harassment so bad that it caused "severe psychological injury." Or, in effect, someone can shoot at you as long as you don't get hit. But last week the Supreme Court stepped in and stretched the definition considerably, ruling that harassment that creates a "hostile and abusive" environment is illegal. "The time for strained legal arguments is over," said Marcia Greenberger of the National Women's Law Center.
 
Inflation: It's Gone! It's Back!
Inflation was pronounced dead on Tuesday, but some people swore they saw it wink on Wednesday. First came a report that producer prices, having trended downward most of the year, fell another 0.2 percent in October. That provided reassurance that inflation had been tamed, and interest rates retreated. But then came news that consumer prices rose 0.4 percent, the most in six months. The main culprit was a higher gas tax, clearly a one-time blip, but rates headed up again.
 
And the economy is stronger, as the numbers keep showing. On Friday came a report that October's retail sales had risen 1.5 percent, the biggest gain in six months.
 
Slowing Down 10-Ton Speeders
Speeding is a big killer on our highways, but it's all relative. A sports car tooling along at 80 is far less lethal than a 10-ton truck. So last week the Transportation Department proposed a ban on radar detectors in trucks over 18,000 pounds. Independent truckers don't like it -- any more than they like the higher diesel prices that spurred last week's protests -- but most other people do, so it will probably happen.
 
Looking Joblessness in the Face
Strong as some economic statistics are, they don't help those who are left behind as this nation goes through wrenching changes and dislocations. And their pain could be seen vividly last week on the streets of Detroit, a city that has had its insides torn out by the icy streamlining of the auto industry. Detroit's jobless -- the city's unemployment rate is 13 percent, twice the national rate -- are so hungry for decent work that thousands of them lined up in the cold dawn for jobs that may never exist. The very iffy jobs were advertised by sponsors of a casino in downtown Detroit to be owned by an Indian tribe in northern Michigan. The casino has slim chances of being approved, underscoring the job-seekers' desperation. But as one applicant said, "There's nothing else happening but crime."
 
COMPANIES
 
A Drug Maker Goes to the People
Makers of prescription drugs have long stayed above the consumer fray, their prices untouched by the messiness of the marketplace. But pressures have mounted from all sides, whether it's Hillary Rodham Clinton scolding them for high prices or upstart generics turning the competitive screws. So, as in so much of the health care universe, times are changing. Last week, in a vivid demonstration of this shift, SmithKline Beecham said it would give $10 rebates for a month's supply of Tagamet, its big-selling ulcer drug. The company's patent on Tagamet runs out in May, and a generic version is on the way, so this could be a signal that name brands will try harder to hang onto their market.
 
Instant Rival for Cellular Phones
Wireless communications: two words that define a big slice of our future. But in the flick of an antenna, that future can take on a far different shape, as was proved last week when a relatively obscure company called Nextel Communications agreed to buy a bunch of mobile-radio licenses from Motorola for $1.8 billion in stock. Suddenly everyone looked at the numbers and realized that with the theoretical ability to serve 180 million people nationwide, Nextel had vaulted itself into a force that has to be taken very, very seriously by cellular phone companies. And Nextel, whose shares have quadrupled in a year, has an edge: In addition to voice conversations, it can offer built-in paging and data communications, which most cellular services don't offer. It faces a long, bumpy ride, though; the cellular industry has a huge head start.
 
Going Hog-Wild Over a Chicken
Some elf clearly went around Wall Street whispering "rotisserie chicken" in eager ears, because last week a lot of investors decided that was the place to put their money. When Boston Chicken, a franchiser, made an initial offering at $20 a share, so many investors scrambled for feathers that when trading opened, the shares more than doubled, ending at $48.50. The shares passed through a lot of hands that day: The offering had just over 2 million shares, but volume was 8.4 million. Investors' ardor cooled by Friday, and the stock slid to $39.75.
 
Paramount Does Its Own Buying
Bored with would-be buyers hammering on its door, Paramount made its own big-money acquisition last week. Paramount, which owns Simon & Schuster, agreed to pay $553 million for Macmillan, to create the world's No. 2 book publisher, after Bertelsmann. And whether it's method or madness, this adds a wrinkle to the Paramount war. The book deal is so big it already raises antitrust flags, but if QVC wins Paramount, the antitrust issue gets even thornier: Advance Publications, owner of Random House, is backing QVC.
 
And let's not forget the latest bulletin on Paramount's dance card: BellSouth has agreed to slip $1.5 billion into QVC's pocket as QVC courts the popular studio.
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
Haiti's Children Pay the Price
When Americans hear of the oil embargo and other sanctions against Haiti, their mental image may well be of Haiti's military rulers holed up in a bunker, isolated by rising international pressure. The reality might be far more cruel. Harvard public health experts said in a study last week that the sanctions are killing as many as 1,000 Haitian children each month. As another, less painful tack, the Administration is trying to get other nations' support for freezing overseas assets of Haiti's leaders. Starving children might prefer that.
 
Disney's French Albatross
The Walt Disney Company is probably wishing it had never tried to translate its magic formula into French. Disney is taking in plenty of money back home, but Euro Disney, clearly the victim of a sorcerer's curse, just drains away the profits. Last week, in fact, Euro Disney -- 49 percent-owned by Disney -- reported a $900 million yearly loss, dragging Disney itself into a quarterly deficit. If it doesn't get fresh cash, Euro Disney said it would face a "liquidity problem" (that's American for "no money"). While banks might fear throwing good money after bad, Disney has too much at stake to walk away.
 
Can Japan's Doors Be Opened?
Japan's economy has long been a prime American target. The goods flow out, we say, but tight regulations keep them from flowing in, giving a nasty tilt to the trade balance. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, three months in office, is determined to hack away at that regulatory wall. Last week a panel he appointed called for easing or ending hundreds of regulations, and even, in a nation built on monopolies, advocated strict application of anti-monopoly laws. So Mr. Hosokawa now has a snazzy bouquet to offer President Clinton when they meet in Seattle this week. But it remains to be seen whether he'll really be able to nudge Japan toward freer markets.

HEADLINE: Those Mind-Boggling Promotions

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

 BODY:
AMERICANS' love of a bargain notwithstanding, consumers are getting fed up with the increasingly complex promotions being served up by corporate marketing departments.
The often dizzying lists of conditions, choices and partners in today's promotions -- a loose term for incentives that typically give shoppers something in addition to the basic product -- leave many people feeling they need an accountant's eyeshade to scour ads for savings. 
 "There are so many schemes, and I don't think they pay," said Lou Nobiletti, a retired hotel executive in Hampton Bays, L.I., one of the many consumers who has given up on hunting for deals among the fine print and now looks only at prices when he shops. "They're too devious."
Such impatience often dooms big marketing efforts, notably a year-old "frequent buyer" program called Air Miles, which halted operations in the United States in May. The program enabled consumers to earn frequent-flier mileage on four airlines by buying products from a raft of big companies, including A.T.& T., Gillette, Citicorp and Procter & Gamble.
Some industry experts say Air Miles faltered because the rewards were too small, but many argue that it also required too much work, like mailing in proofs of purchase.
Consumers do embrace certain promotions, the ones that keep the fine print to a minimum and offer rewards they want. The General Motors Mastercard, for example, has been a runaway success. It gives consumers a 5 percent rebate on purchases that they can then use to reduce the price of a new G.M. car. In just over a year, the company has signed up six million accounts.
In contrast, General Electric offers a credit card with 27 marketing partners like Kmart and Macy's, which send a packet of coupons worth $250 to cardholders every three months. Each coupon has its own conditions, like $10 off a $50 purchase. For every $500 spent with the card, a shopper gets $10 that can be used only at the 27 retailers.
"You need an attache case to really use this card," said Robert B. McKinley, president of Ram Research, a credit-card research firm in Frederick, Md. "Not only is it messy, but where are the coupons when you need them?"
Broad changes in consumer attitudes are difficult to prove. But interviews with consumers and marketing experts leave little doubt that many people are wearied by deals that tax their time-starved lives.
Judith Langer, president of Langer Associates, a New York-based research firm that conducts more than 200 focus groups a year, said that she often hears complaints from consumers about information overload. "The feeling is very much, 'It's too much, and I need to simplify my life,' " she said.
The publisher of The Tightwad Gazette newsletter, Amy Dacyczyn, can work up enthusiasm for almost any penny-pinching idea, including buying huge stuffed animals at yard sales and eviscerating them to make Halloween costumes. But she finds today's proliferating promotions a turnoff. "If I don't have time to sit down and figure them out, I ignore them," she said.
Nevertheless, surveys of the packaged goods industry -- considered a bellwether of the broader marketplace -- suggest that companies are spending a growing percentage of their marketing budgets on promotions, often joining forces in complex deals.
A joint Nabisco and Sony promotion that started this month can earn customers up to $28 worth of rebates. To reach that figure, they must buy four combinations of the companies' products chosen from a list of more than 45 items -- including Nabisco cookies and crackers and Sony compact disks and video games -- and then send away for the rebates. Ten million booklets are being distributed to help explain the offer.
GQ magazine has sponsored a program called Return on Investment in which the 10,000 shoppers who spend the most in men's departments at various Dayton's and Marshall Field stores in Illinois and Minnesota, paying with the stores' own credit cards, can earn credits on what they buy. And what are those credits worth? That depends. The shoppers who qualify will not know until they spend their credits, but there's another catch: Those credits can only be used at "auctions," where customers bid on merchandise donated by GQ and the stores.
IN September, Cathay Pacific Airways offered members of American Airlines' frequent-flier program a way to earn 80,000 frequent-flier miles -- or 50,000 without even leaving the ground: Simply call the airline and give it the names of 10 people whom you expect to fly round-trip between Los Angeles and Hong Kong in Cathay Pacific's first- or business-class before next March.
Oh, and if the travelers also want bonus miles, they can stay at an Inter-Continental Hotel and earn 5,000 bonus miles, but only after their fourth stay. That is separate from the hotel chain's regular 500 miles, but that's earned per night. Got all that?
Why are many promotions so complicated? For one, programs with many partners are often born out of companies' desire to pool their resources to create bigger, splashier promotions that they hope will stimulate sales in the sluggish economy.
Those promotions are also often designed by the companies themselves, rather than by an outside agency. The results may appear simple to insiders but confuse consumers.
And many promotions are intentionally complex. Companies hope to get top dollar from affluent customers with demanding jobs and little time to jump through the hoops of a promotion.
Finally, the marketing whirlwind is often whipped up by a brief promotional success that other companies rush to match. Ford, for example, soon matched General Motors' offer of a credit card that earns rebates. That, in turn, leads to disagreement over whether such deals are ultimately beneficial.
Al Ries, a marketing consultant in Greenwich, Conn., said proliferating promotions detract attention from the products' merits. A deal can help win customers, but they can just as easily be lured away by competitors.
To wit, much of the current promotional flurry seems to have been inspired by the popularity of frequent-flyer programs. The advantage won by American Airlines in 1981 when it introduced the first program was quickly lost after the other major carriers started their own versions. Now those outstanding frequent-flier miles represent enormous liabilities for the airlines.
"In a sense, you're not building anything," Mr. Ries said. "All this endless extra effort, on both the consumers' and manufacturers' part, is not good for the economy."
COUNTERING that, Chris Sutherland, executive director of the Promotion Marketing Association of America in New York, said that the general rise of promotions -- complicated or otherwise -- reflected healthy competition that could only be considered good for consumers.
"These marketing programs will work to the exact extent that the public will tolerate them," he said. "It's a wonderfully democratic process."
Many companies also defend their sometimes complicated promotions. NBC teamed up with Kellogg's, United Airlines and Marriott hotels this fall for a promotion to attract viewers to their new fall shows. They then faced competition from a similar cross-promotion by CBS and Kmart. Their respective promotions required a half-page each of fine-print explanations in a Sunday coupon insert.
But that didn't worry the network executives, who say they are more concerned about putting together a promotion big enough to cut through the advertising clutter than they are about confusing consumers.
"Even if you were overwhelmed by that, we just got exposure for our shows," said Alan Cohen, senior vice president for marketing for NBC TV.
Executives at Northwest Airlines, which is among the more prolific carriers in devising promotions with fine print, said they attract customers who might not have flown. In one recent offering, the more friends, family or colleagues who signed up for the same flight at the same time, the greater the discounts. Savings were also based on the origin and destination of the flight.
"The consumer can wade through it, if it's a good enough deal," said Susan Edberg, director of passenger marketing for Northwest. Promotions, she added, "become complicated in order for it to be win-win."
But complications may produce a loser.
Keith Mills, chairman of the Loyalty Management Group that ran Air Miles, said, "You're struggling to get a share of the brain capacity that consumers have left."
 
 
 
MAKING A BID FOR SIMPLICITY
 APPARENTLY recognizing the consumer backlash against the rising complexity of many promotions, some companies are marketing simplicity.
"Humans do not like complexity," Oxford Health Plans Inc. said in a full-page newspaper ad promising "less paperwork and more care." It adds, "Keeping things simple makes humans happier and more compatible with the fellow humans." And other advertisers are trying a similar tack.
Continental Airlines trumpets the bold-type phrase "No Restrictions" in advertisements for its new Peanuts Fares. In contrast, a recent -- and more traditional -- ad for the Delta Shuttle lists 17 restrictions.
A.T.&T. started offering a "Personal Choice Calling Card" this fall that lets customers choose their numbers, rather than being dictated a lengthy string of digits. "Some customers have been telling us that they would like to see less complicated products," an A.T.&T. spokesman said.
A recent survey by the Marketing Corporation of America found that 53 percent of supermarkets were using so-called everyday low pricing to some degree, up from 46 percent last year. This strategy is an alternative to the industry's "high-low" pricing, in which losses or reduced margins on sale items are offset by higher-priced non-sale items.
In addition to supermarkets, big chains like Staples, Wal-Mart and Home Depot have combined cavernous stores with steady prices to build high volume and profitable sales. The Saturn car division of General Motors has won praise from consumers for its no-haggling sales policy.
The Sheraton hotel chain and Zenith Data Systems both lowered suggested prices, putting them closer to the levels that people actually pay after discounting.

For Poor Women, Training In Entrepreneurship
 The American Woman's Economic Development Corporation and the Woman's Center for Education and Career Advancement are offering an entrepreneurial training program for poor women. The program, financed by the city's Department of Employment, will offer students instruction in business skills as well as counseling on personal matters like child care. 
 "We are looking for women who are serious about the business they want to be in," said Elisa Moore, director of special training programs at the development corporation. "Our applicants must be highly motivated and willing to commit to attending one seven-hour day from 2 P.M. to 9 P.M. each week for 27 consecutive weeks of classroom training."
Orientation sessions are planned tomorrow and Thursday and on Dec. 2 and Dec. 7. For information, call (212) 692-9100.
 
Along With Your Paper Comes a Quart of Milk
 It's a return to the past on the Upper West Side, where Mitchell's Newspaper Delivery Service has branched out into the milk delivery business with its subsidiary, the Milkman.
The company, which has been delivering newspapers in Manhattan and the Bronx for 45 years, purchases milk from Elmhurst Dairies in Jamaica, Queens, and charges its newspaper customers 91 cents a quart or $1.65 a gallon, delivered to their doors between 4 A.M. and 6 A.M.
About 1,500 of Mitchell's 35,000 Manhattan newspaper customers have signed on for milk. The company hit Lincoln Towers on the West Side first, and hopes eventually to extend service to the East Side and the other boroughs.
"Manhattan residents are always running out of milk," said Mitchell Newman, president of the Milkman. "They don't have cars to get to the store four or five blocks away, particularly in inclement weather."
 
From Bankers to Anchors: Breakfast Honors Women
 The New York Woman's Agenda, an organization of 36 national and local women's groups that works to promote the economic and political power of women in New York, is planning its second annual Star Breakfast to honor women of achievement.
Gloria Steinem will preside over the breakfast, which will take place Wednesday, Dec. 1, at 7:30 A.M. at the New York Hilton, Avenue of the Americas at 53d Street. The women honored this year will be Carol Parry, managing director of Chemical Bank; Beth Bronner, president of Revlon Professional; Caroline Jones, president and chief executive of Caroline Jones Advertising; Kaity Tong, news anchor at WPIX-TV, and Suleika Drinane, executive director of the Institute for Puerto Rican and Hispanic Elderly. Tickets are $45. For information, call (212) 687-2484.

HEADLINE: About Foreign Capital

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"How to Get, and Keep, Foreign Capital" (Viewpoints, Oct. 31) ignores that for every seller there must be a buyer, for every borrower there must be a lender. 
 The fact is that we get foreign capital automatically whenever our imports exceed our exports. When we buy a Toyota (certainly if it is made in Japan and not Kentucky), we pay for it in dollars. At the moment the Japanese acquire those dollars, they have invested in the United States. They may then buy stocks, bonds, Treasury bills or Rockefeller Center, but that is merely a matter of portfolio adjustment. They gave us their capital when they sold us the Toyota.
If the Japanese try to sell dollars and get yen, where must they go? To other Japanese. But that simply means that the identity of the Japanese providers of capital to the United States has changed. There has been no pull-out. If they get into, say, German marks, then the German sellers of marks are left with the dollars and the identity of our foreign investors has changed nationality but there has still been no pull-out.
Indeed the only way that foreigners can pull out of their investments in the United States (other than to give them away) is to buy United States goods. If our import surplus changes to an export surplus, the foreign investments will be drawn down.
As the writer, Madis Senner, points out, when foreigners try to pull out of a currency they lower its value. That, he might have added, may offer its own corrective. If the dollar falls enough, we will have that export surplus and foreigners will indeed be withdrawing their capital. But then, of course, we will not need it.
It is not true, by the way, that a lower exchange rate raises interest rates. A central bank, such as our Federal Reserve, may foolishly make money scarce and raise interest rates in an effort to keep an exchange rate from falling. And the view that this may not succeed -- that the exchange rate will fall further -- will raise domestic interest rates as investors demand compensation for the exchange rate losses. But the lower exchange rates in themselves, except possibly to the extent they make the economy more prosperous and raise the demand for funds which the Fed does not accommodate, will not raise interest rates.
The central mistake, an all too common one in financial circles, involves a failure to look at the economy as, simply enough, both sides of a transaction. Foreigners cannot "withdraw" from their American investments any more than there can be a general withdrawal from the stock market. There may be a "wave of sellers," as commentators frequently put it. But for every seller there must be a buyer.
As with the stock market, a surge of foreign dollar selling will lower prices. But the big losers will then be the foreigners themselves. The value of their dollar investments in terms of their own currencies, which must be their ultimate concern, will fall.

Dreams Advertised Before the Curtain Rises

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER

 BODY:
BOTH Nancy Coyne and Matthew Serino are fond of saying that the products they represent don't have any shelf life. She is the creative director and chief executive and he is the president of Serino Coyne, the advertising agency that handles the majority of Broadway shows. And the economics of producing on Broadway are more dubious than ever; it's a rare show indeed that can hang on if the promise of a sustained audience isn't established right away.
"If you were starting out in advertising and had to pick a business to specialize in, it wouldn't be theater," Ms. Coyne said the other day from her aerie 36 floors above the theater district. "How many products are there that can disappear in one night?" 
 The agency represents 12 of the 18 shows currently on the boards; it is already at work on campaigns for "Grease" and "Damn Yankees," shows that are months away from their Broadway premieres, and it has several shows on the brink of opening, including Neil Simon's "Laughter on the 23d Floor" and "Perestroika," part 2 of Tony Kushner's "Angels in America."
But the focus of the moment is "The Red Shoes," an $8 million musical based on the 1947 movie about the ballet. The show, which stars Roger Rees as the impresario Lermontov and Margaret Illmann as the prima ballerina, is in previews at the Gershwin Theater for an official opening on Dec. 2. This is a crucial period, as the production stands on its first, rickety legs and everyone keeps a wary eye on the box office. It's also a time in which word of mouth and advertising begin to coalesce in anticipation of the first reviews, which will help determine the post-opening marketing strategy.
"During the previews we're deciding what to sell," Ms. Coyne said. "Is it the star? Is it the dancing? Is it the songs? By opening night we've decided on strength. If the critics agree with us, it's terrific. They've done our work for us. If they don't, we continue to sell what we were going to sell. We just don't have their help."
To that end, she has been roaming the Gershwin, listening to the audience during intermissions and after the show. (The women's room, she said, is particularly good for research.) "One of the things I'm hearing loud and clear is that the ballet scene itself is magnificent," she said. "If we do a post-opening commercial, it'll be filmed, I'd almost bet you."
"The Red Shoes" may have to run a year to earn back its investors' money, and Serino Coyne has been hired to make sure this happens. But it's also in the agency's own interest. Its commission-based billings are
tied to the amount the client (that is, the producer) spends on media placement.
"So if we design an ad for a Broadway show that closes, and the ad doesn't run, we don't get paid," Ms. Coyne said.
It is also true that the advertising budget ordinarily starts at 10 percent of the production cost and is generally 10 percent of the gross after opening night. But money available for ads often ends up being pinched by other concerns. If changes in the script mean that a character needs another costume and there's no money left in the costume budget, it will probably come out of advertising. That makes some sense; a blank billboard is probably less devastating to a show than a leading man onstage without his pants.
So the real money for a Broadway ad agency comes from long runs, when television and newspaper ads serve to perpetuate the interest in a known quantity.
One reason Serino Coyne is the leading agency on Broadway -- its chief competitors are LeDonne/Wilner & Weiner and Grey Entertainment and Media -- is its reputation for aggressiveness. Another is its affiliations with the producer Cameron Mackintosh and the Shubert Organization, which produces shows and owns the theaters that house Mr. Mackintosh's "Cats," "Les Miserables," "Miss Saigon" and "Phantom of the Opera."
Serino Coyne is responsible for the American campaigns for all these shows, with the advantage of having inherited the famous logos, now indelible symbols -- the Phantom mask, the helicopter of "Miss Saigon," the eyes of "Cats," and Cossette, the waif from "Les Miz" -- from Dewynters, Mr. Mackintosh's agency in England, where the shows originated. Of course, Serino Coyne has developed some indelible imagery of its own -- the rolling dice for "Guys and Dolls" and the winged "A" of "Angels in America."
The agency, which employs 70 people and bills about $50 million annually, 60 percent of which is from the theater, was started in 1977 by Ms. Coyne, 47, Mr. Serino, 50, and a third partner, Nick Nappi, who has since left. They had defected together from the powerful company Blaine Thompson, now defunct; among their first clients were "A Chorus Line" and "The Wiz."
It had been only eight years since Broadway started advertising on television, with an animated spot for "1776," and three years since live action was introduced, with Bob Fosse's famous ad for "Pippin." Not every show can afford to advertise on television (it now costs $100,000 to $200,000 to produce a 30-second spot, not including air time). But Serino Coyne made it a specialty, proving television's effectiveness when its ads for "Evita" in 1979 turned the tide on a show that had been critically strafed.
Three years later, the agency filmed a pivotal ad for "Torch Song Trilogy." Widely perceived initially as a gay show, "Torch Song" ran nearly three years and won a Tony, spurred by the landmark "testimonial" ad in which a clearly diverse collection of theatergoers praised the show.
For "The Red Shoes," Serino Coyne got a high ad budget, just under $1 million, and was able to make a 30-second television spot of snippets from the movie, because the rights had been secured free by the show's producer, Martin Starger. The rest of the money is being parsed out according to a strategy aimed first at the most likely patrons.
"We've gone right to the ballet audience," Ms. Coyne said, referring to direct mailings offering discounted tickets to subscribers to major dance companies and readers of dance publications. "They serve as advance notice for people who like to be there first," she said, "and they help fill up previews so the word begins to get out."
Ads featuring the show's logo -- a spare, clean painting of a pair of ankles and feet, clad in toe shoes and poised as though to start a dance -- are at train stations and on billboards. It usually takes two or three months for a logo to provoke instant recognition, Ms. Coyne said, but with such a simple iconographic reiteration of the show's title, that should be accomplished sooner.
The idea is then to begin reaching wider and wider circles of people who need more and more corroboration of a show's quality before buying tickets. Tony nominations in May bring on a whole new attack.
Asked for the eventual target audience for "The Red Shoes," Ms. Coyne smiled and offered the deviously composed copy for the flier being spread around New York hotel lobbies: " 'The Red Shoes,' on Broadway," the flier reads. "For girls everywhere, their mothers, their grandmothers and all the men who love them."
That would be everybody, wouldn't it?

HEADLINE: GARDENING;
A Softer Approach to Growth Problems

BYLINE: By JOAN LEE FAUST

 BODY:
WHEN a particular plant fails to perform as expected, the solution sometimes is a cursory examination followed by an application from a spray can. Much better is taking a sampling of the plant's problem to a professional consultant for a proper diagnosis and suggestion of treatment.
Many gardeners now have a handy reference library so they can do their own homework. Greater use of town, garden and nature-center libraries has encouraged this. 
 But the trend now, especially among professionals, is to look at the total picture. There is a realization that a plant is part of a bigger whole. Underneath are the soils and above is the tree canopy formed by other plants surrounding it.
There are also other factors involved in the growth pattern, such as climate, temperature, rainfall and light. An excess or deficiency of these factors can stress growth and exacerbate problems.
When sprays are used to control the two-spotted mite, for example, the problem often worsens because the insect rebounds after the pesticide application. The spray application kills off the beneficial insects.
This sort of secondary reaction can happen when a single remedy is suggested to control a pest or disease. The beneficial insect or environmental factor that solves the problem naturally is destroyed and the plant problem often worsens. Some of these environmental factors may be as simple as cool weather, which may slow down a problem or hot weather, possibly making it worse, depending on the insects and their life cycles.
Quite often a predator or insect is introduced to control or better a particular need, only to have that introduced insect be the problem. Remember what happened to the gypsy moth, which was innocently introduced to the United States as a benefit to a possible silk trade in this country? The pest has now spread far and wide and during its population peaks, the insect's caterpillars are devastating.
Solutions now being sought are the less invasive means of control. For this reason many of the newer, gentler, less invasive control systems have been winning favor. The Integrated Pest Management system accents plant well-being as well as going after problems.
Even Thomas Jefferson saw the need for maintaining vibrant plant growth and has been noted in writing, "I suspect that the insects which have harassed you have been encouraged by the feebleness of your plants; and that has been produced by the lean state of your soil."
One of the factors gleaned from this philosophy is the need for garden sanitation: cleaning up hiding places of insects, which like to nest quietly for the winter or lay their eggs in protected places.
There are two references that may prove helpful in following the softer approach to pest-disease control. One is "The Healthy Garden Handbook," put together by the editors of Mother Earth News and published by Simon & Schuster. On the title page of this handy paperback book is this subtitle, "Building good soil and nourishing crops can keep most garden problems from ever occurring."
The other reference is quite a large tome (716 pages), "Common-Sense Pest Control: The least toxic solutions for your home, garden, pets and community," by William Olkowski, Sheila Daar and Helga Olkowski and is published by The Taunton Press. It is not a lap book, but well worth having or consulting.
Not every facet of pest control is following this trend, however. Scientists in pest-control research are seeking to solve the problems chemically and through the efforts of biotechnology. This sort of research is directed toward the support of a huge agricultural industry.
Some of the goals the researchers look for in the development of new insecticides are effectiveness, minimizing the insect's development of its own resistance to the insecticide, targeting, freedom from causing secondary effects in the insect's population, nonresidue in the food chain and cost effectiveness.
Dr. Susan W. Fisher expressed the research goals in a discussion of this problem in "Pesticides for Tomorrow," published in a recent issue of The American Nurseryman. She said, "Regardless of which insecticides emerge in our quest, the need for integrated pest management will remain. As with existing products, insect resistance to chemicals of the future is a great concern. By limiting chemical application to the most effective and well-targeted uses, I.P.M. can retard the development of resistance, extending the useful life of both newly developed and traditional insecticides.
"The magic bullet -- an economical product that would eliminate all undesirable pests without harming nontarget organisms or the environment -- is an impossible dream," Dr. Fisher said. "But with intelligent design and judicious application, we should be able to hold our own in the ongoing battle with pests."

Not every facet of pest control is following this trend, however. Scientists in pest-control research are seeking to solve the problems chemically and through the efforts of biotechnology. This sort of research is directed toward the support of a huge agricultural industry.
Some of the goals the researchers look for in the development of new insecticides are effectiveness, minimizing the insect's development of its own resistance to the insecticide, targeting, freedom from causing secondary effects in the insect's population, nonresidue in the food chain and cost effectiveness.
Dr. Susan W. Fisher expressed the research goals in a discussion of this problem in "Pesticides for Tomorrow," published in a recent issue of The American Nurseryman. She said, "Regardless of which insecticides emerge in our quest, the need for integrated pest management will remain. As with existing products, insect resistance to chemicals of the future is a great concern. By limiting chemical application to the most effective and well-targeted uses, I.P.M. can retard the development of resistance, extending the useful life of both newly developed and traditional insecticides.
"The magic bullet -- an economical product that would eliminate all undesirable pests without harming nontarget organisms or the environment -- is an impossible dream," Dr. Fisher said. "But with intelligent design and judicious application, we should be able to hold our own in the ongoing battle with pests."

HEADLINE: GARDENING;
A Softer Approach to Growth Problems

BYLINE: By JOAN LEE FAUST

 BODY:
WHEN a particular plant fails to perform as expected, the solution sometimes is a cursory examination followed by an application from a spray can. Much better is taking a sampling of the plant's problem to a professional consultant for a proper diagnosis and suggestion of treatment.
Many gardeners now have a handy reference library so they can do their own homework. Greater use of town, garden and nature-center libraries has encouraged this. 
 But the trend now, especially among professionals, is to look at the total picture. There is a realization that a plant is part of a bigger whole. Underneath are the soils and above is the tree canopy formed by other plants surrounding it.
There are also other factors involved in the growth pattern, such as climate, temperature, rainfall and light. An excess or deficiency of these factors can stress growth and exacerbate problems.
When sprays are used to control the two-spotted mite, for example, the problem often worsens because the insect rebounds after the pesticide application. The spray application kills off the beneficial insects.
This sort of secondary reaction can happen when a single remedy is suggested to control a pest or disease. The beneficial insect or environmental factor that solves the problem naturally is destroyed and the plant problem often worsens. Some of these environmental factors may be as simple as cool weather, which may slow down a problem or hot weather, possibly making it worse, depending on the insects and their life cycles.
Quite often a predator or insect is introduced to control or better a particular need, only to have that introduced insect be the problem. Remember what happened to the gypsy moth, which was innocently introduced to the United States as a benefit to a possible silk trade in this country? The pest has now spread far and wide and during its population peaks, the insect's caterpillars are devastating.
Solutions now being sought are the less invasive means of control. For this reason many of the newer, gentler, less invasive control systems have been winning favor. The Integrated Pest Management system accents plant well-being as well as going after problems.
Even Thomas Jefferson saw the need for maintaining vibrant plant growth and has been noted in writing, "I suspect that the insects which have harassed you have been encouraged by the feebleness of your plants; and that has been produced by the lean state of your soil."
One of the factors gleaned from this philosophy is the need for garden sanitation: cleaning up hiding places of insects, which like to nest quietly for the winter or lay their eggs in protected places.

HEADLINE: THE NATION: The Post-Nuclear Family;
Tell It to Mom, Dad and the Authorities

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS

 BODY:
BIT by bit, the country's urge for collective child-rearing is becoming more visible. In recent months residents in such disparate communities as Texarkana, Ark., North Arlington, N.J., Atlanta and Dallas joined in supporting municipal curfews for young people. Last month parents cheered as Attorney General Janet Reno threatened the television industry with Government action unless it curbed its reliance on violent fare.
Parent groups also have watched with satisfaction as the record industry has adopted a uniform system of labeling recordings containing expletives or sexually explicit or graphically violent lyrics. 
 Feeling thwarted in trying to rear their children and enforce standards of behavior that at one time seemed clear and universal, parents are increasingly reaching out for help and welcoming any help that is volunteered. Many appear willing to subcontract a portion of their role to government, schools and whatever communal vestiges remain in a mobile and complex society.
Today children have access through a variety of sources -- from CD's to videos -- to a wide range of adult images and at much earlier ages, said Gary Alan Fine, a sociologist at the University of Georgia. And with the erosion of any consensus on what is appropriate, he said, some parents are ceding to institutions some of the prerogatives they once jealousy guarded.
"Parents feel that they can't deal with this or make their family the haven from the harmful and heartless world that it has been seen as in the past," Mr. Fine said. "TV violence and curfew laws are flashpoints of the concern and reflect our fear that we can't promote childhood innocence as we are supposed to do. The 90's in that sense are a nightmare of the 50's, when we all thought we had a clear sense of what families are or are supposed to do."
This ghost of the 1950's family, projected largely through popular television, today stalks the homes of very different families. Financially and emotionally stressed, more often headed by a single mother, many families look nothing like those idealized two-parent nuclear units able to handle any crisis while transmitting the correct cultural values.
"As a demographer, I have to attribute some of the problems with raising kids to the decline of the family, even though I hate that idea," said Martha Farnesworth Riche, who directs the Population Reference Bureau, a research organization in Washington. Ms. Riche expressed some conflict herself over the larger social benefits that flowed from increased career opportunities for women and the impact that their work had on the amount of time available for child-rearing.
Time seems to be the crucial element. If parents have less time to teach their children self-control, eventually outside agencies step into the vacuum. "The fact of the matter is that children have less supervision," she said. "And those boomers who were raised in two-parent families are often raising their boomlet offspring in single-parent homes."
It is a phenomenon that transcends economic and racial lines. The concerns about parenting were a subtext of the family values debate last year. Vice President Dan Quayle criticized the television character Murphy Brown's decision to have a child out of wedlock. For him and other critics, it represented yet another blow to the increasingly fragile ideal of a two-parent family.
Today 16.6 million children -- one in four -- live with one parent, double the proportion of two decades ago. Among black children, only about one-third live in two-parent households, while two-thirds lived in such households in 1960. As the number of single-parent families increases, so does the number of children living in poverty. About half of the children today will spend time in single-parent families. Most of these will live in such households for most of their childhood, said Larry L. Bumpass, a demographer at the University of Wisconsin.
Charles Murray, an analyst with the American Enterprise Institute, noted that among whites, out-of-wedlock births have reached 22 percent, which approaches the 27 percent rate among blacks in the mid-60's, when scholars like Daniel Patrick Moynihan began voicing concern about the future of the black family.
"I think white families are about to reach critical mass," said Mr. Murray. He and other social observers say that one way to address the problem and ease these pressures in the future is to trumpet the strengths of two-parent families again. And many families would argue that they are successful in conveying those values.
Some, rather than ceding traditional parental functions, like curfews, to the state, want to take over some traditional state functions, like education. A growing number of parents, particularly those with strong religious beliefs, choose to teach their children at home. Many exercise strict control over what comes into the home via television, shunning cable television or blocking out certain channels.
Other experts argue that the cultural and economic forces demand another tack. Although the family structure has changed, problems affecting it reflect general economic decline and the disappearance of supports that existed after World War II, from G.I. benefits to a publicly funded construction boom that provided work, said Stephanie Coontz, a historian specializing in the family at Evergreen State College in Olympia, Wash.
"There's nothing wrong with families asking for help because they have always been asking for and getting help," said Ms. Coontz, who wrote "The Way We Never Were: American Families and the Nostalgia Trap" (Basic Books, 1992). "The problem is that the help we give nowadays, especially to poor families, beats them down and tells them they are inadequate rather than giving them confidence. What we have to do to really help is stop beating up on them because they don't look like Ozzie and Harriet."

HEADLINE: Nafta and Jobs: In a Numbers War, No One Can Count

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
IF Congress gives in and approves the North American Free Trade Agreement, then the Clinton Administration undoubtedly will proclaim a new era for jobs. More than 400,000 already have been created from the expanding trade with Mexico and many more will come -- unless the President has his math mixed up. But tens of thousands of jobs might in fact have disappeared, as the AFL-CIO insists. Could they both be right?
Probably they both are wrong. Abundant evidence is emerging that jobs are shifting across borders too rapidly to declare the United States a job winner or a job loser from the trade agreement. Counting the gains and losses could add jobs one year and subtract them the next, with this pattern persisting into the 21st century. 
 "The employment impact over the long run is likely to be small," said Robert M. Solow, a Nobel laureate in economics who favors the treaty, whatever the job count, on the ground that free trade is good policy.
But as the issue goes before the House of Representatives this week, millions of Americans are insecure about their jobs. That has made job creation the principal criterion for judging the free trade agreement.
The problem is that no one has measured the job flow with any precision. There has been no comprehensive head count since Mexico first began in the mid-1980's to allow American companies to operate in Mexico as if that country were part of the United States.
Rather than a head count, formulas are used -- and perhaps because of their errors, they have failed to resolve the arguments over free trade. Economists feed the formulas into computers to simulate the impact of an open border on jobs. These simulations mostly conclude that the trade agreement will have created between 30,000 and 170,000 new jobs in the United States five years from now.
But the simulations make assumptions that are not always true. Many assume, for example, that American companies building factories in Mexico won't stint on investments in the United States. And that is an assumption that the AFL-CIO calls hocus-pocus.
What the union movement zeroes in on, instead, are the 500,000 low-wage workers in American-owned assembly plants in Mexico. These plants turn out products once made in the United States, at factories now closed.
"We think those jobs, in large measure, would have stayed at home if the Mexican Government had not made it so easy to move them across the border," said Mark Anderson, director of the AFL-CIO task force on trade. "And the free trade agreement locks in this arrangement."
The calculations go on and on. The Administration, resorting to another formula, declares that sure, jobs have migrated to Mexico, particularly low-wage assembly jobs, but exports to Mexico have also risen -- and for every $1 billion rise in exports, American companies hire 17,600 people to make the exported products. That appears to be an overstatement at best. But it is this equation that allows the Administration to claim that expanded trade with Mexico has created more than 400,000 jobs.
On the plus side of the jobs calculation, at least from the United States' point of view, the Administration, the AFL-CIO and Congress seem to overlook a "bonus" from Canada. The free trade agreement between the United States and Canada, which went into effect in 1989, has encouraged the migration of thousands of jobs to the United States, where labor costs are lower than Canada's. In the overall job score, the migration from Canada has helped to offset losses to Mexico. That migration involves companies like Tridon Ltd., which shut down an auto parts operation with 550 workers in western Ontario and reopened it in Tennessee.
But again, neither the Canadians nor the Americans know with any precision how many Tridons there are and how many thousands of jobs might have migrated, although some Canadians are as angry about their loses as the AFL-CIO is about the shift to lower-wage Mexican workers.
"There is a dynamic in these free trade agreements that is always pushing wages downward," said Bruce Campbell, a research fellow at the Canadian Center for Policy Alternatives.
Putting aside the numbers, the free trade agreement has complicated the Administration's conduct of foreign policy in general. Pushing for passage, the President has repeatedly declared that American foreign policy would suffer a "profound setback" if Congress rejects the treaty.
One day later, Mr. Clinton goes to Seattle for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, involving 15 nations. The agenda there is to talk, once again, about creating a free trade zone across the Pacific, very much like the North American Free Trade Agreement. Barriers that inhibit trade with Japan and China, for example, would come down, much as they have come down with Mexico.
Indeed, the Administration appears to have linked its efforts to increase exports elsewhere in the world to passage by Congress of the free trade agreement with Mexico. And in Congress, the job score, not foreign policy, is the big obsession.
In that debate companies like the Zenith Electronics Corporation represent perhaps the most difficult job counting problem. Some 10,000 Zenith jobs in the United States, mostly assembling television sets, have disappeared in recent years, only to reappear in Mexico as 18,000 jobs at Zenith assembly plants in that country. But Zenith continues to employ 6,000 Americans, and these jobs will be saved by the North American Free Trade Agreement, according to Jerry K. Pearlman, chairman of Zenith.
Many of the 6,000 work at factories in the Midwest that produce sophisticated TV tubes for the sets assembled in Mexico. The logic that saves their jobs goes this way. Right now, 3 million TV tubes are shipped to Mexico from the Far East. The free trade agreement, favoring North America, would raise tariffs on these Far Eastern tubes, and they would become too expensive. So companies that assemble television sets in Mexico would turn to Zenith and other American tube suppliers, and Zenith's tube sales would rise.
"We are already expanding our tube operation and that will mean 200 to 300 more American jobs for us," Mr. Pearlman said.
He took the argument one step further. Offering a theme frequently heard in the treaty debate, he argued that Zenith's 6,000 jobs in America might not exist today if Mexico had not gradually dismantled tariff barriers, allowing companies like Zenith to set up Mexican assembly plants so easily and staff them with low-wage workers.
"Without Mexico, we might have gone to the Far East to assemble television sets," Mr. Pearlman said. The tubes might then have been purchased from Far Eastern manufacturers, and the American operation shut, he added.
The Smith Corona Corporation complicates and skews the job count in another direction. Its actions challenge the Administration's contention that for every $1 billion of exported merchandise, nearly 17,600 jobs are created, on average, to produce the goods. Without such a formula, and the big job count that it produces -- over 700,000 based on total American exports to Mexico and not just the rise since the late 1980's -- the trade agreement might be even harder to sell to Congress.
 
Same Suppliers
 But are the parts that are exported to Smith Corona's new typewriter plant in Mexico really exports? Until recently, Smith Corona purchased the same parts from American suppliers, who shipped them to the company's plant in Cortland, N.Y. That plant has closed, in favor of the Mexican facility. And the parts purchased from the suppliers for Cortland are being rerouted to Mexico. The rerouting makes them job-creating exports, although the suppliers have not necessarily added workers.
"It is true that exports to Japan or Germany create jobs, but when nearly half of what we export to Mexico comes back as assembled products, that means that the trade agreement is getting credit for jobs that always existed," said Harley Shaiken of the University of California at Berkeley, a an expert on Mexican labor issues.
Whatever the counting problems, the count seems certain to keep changing. Wal-Mart, for example, recently opened a super-center in Mexico City, and it has 13 other big stores in Mexico. Most of the merchandise is purchased from suppliers in the United States, but Wal-Mart also stocks its shelves with goods made by American companies at their Mexican factories. As these goods fill more and more Wal-Mart shelves, jobs should rise in Mexico and fall in the United States.
The free trade agreement also encourages some American companies to come home. The National Association of Manufacturers, in a recent survey, turned up seven companies in this category, companies that eliminated jobs in Mexico and recreated them in the United States. One of them is the McIlhenny Company, which had manufactured tabasco sauce in Mexico.
The plant had been located there to get around Mexican restrictions, just as Japanese auto companies put plants in the United States in the 1980's to get around quotas that limited imported Japanese cars. But now the Mexican restrictions are gone, and McIlhenny has shifted production to a Louisiana plant, deciding that it is more economical to serve both the United States and Canada from a single American factory.
However vague the numbers are, the jobs debate seems to have become a vehicle for venting other, harder-to-express concerns. The Zenith case, for example, illustrates the labor movement's main objection to free trade. More important than the job count, the approval of the treaty would be another defeat for labor in its struggle with management, says Mr. Anderson of the AFL-CIO. Companies gain the flexibility to move to Mexico if their American workers become too demanding, particularly over wages.
"What is unstated in the debate is that you are adding 50 million low-wage Mexican workers, many of them skilled, to the United States labor force," Mr. Anderson said. "They are not located across the Pacific, but in a country that is attached to ours, as if it were another state."
The unsteady American economy also seems to fuel the debate, in a nation where layoffs are now so commonplace. "We Americans have no confidence in the economy's future and that is making everyone anxious about Nafta," Professor Solow said. "If you are feeling genuinely nervous about life, then every time you cross the street, you are afraid you are going to be hit by a car."
The Canadians share this nervousness. The C.D. Howe Institute in Toronto says that about 50,000 Canadian jobs have disappeared as a result of the five-year-old trade agreement, with an unknown number of them gone forever.
American companies like the Gerber Products Company and the Gillette Company, for example, closed plants in Canada and turned to supplying their Canadian customers through exports, mostly from American factories.
Gillette phased out 590 jobs in Canada but created "no new jobs" in the United States, a company spokesman said. Still, the stepped-up razor production may have avoided layoffs in the United States -- a plus for America in the job count that never stops.

H MM . . . let's see . . . the North American Free Trade Agreement is good for Detroit automakers and Midwestern corn growers, but bad for sugar and citrus.

While we're at it, is the Pacific summit meeting this week in Seattle a good time to twist a few arms? The unions have been on a tear about all those cotton-blend undies coming in from Indonesia -- or was it Malaysia? 
 If you are confused by the pettiness of a trade debate that President Clinton, and many economists, say represents a turning point in America's economic relations with the rest of the world, join the crowd. "Even your MacNeil-Lehrer viewers, the 2 percent who really pay attention, don't get it," says Paul Krugman, an M.I.T. economist.
For what comfort it is worth, it has always been thus. Over the centuries governments have sacrificed wealth, and blood, in the name of theories that most economists now view as nonsense. "The intellectual foundations of free trade only date from Adam Smith," said Charles Kindleberger, author of "A Financial History of Western Europe." And even when the idea has been given lip service, policy has typically been undermined by special interests.
Much of what could be called trade policy before the 18th century amounted to using the control of transport routes to sock it to consumers, creating monopolies on the sale of scarce commodities from spices to fabrics to perfumes. The early Portuguese and Spanish explorers, Mr. Kindleberger notes, were either trying to break the trade monopolies of the eastern Mediterranean powers or trying to establish new ones. As Spain's power waned, Britain, France and the Netherlands jockeyed for control over the surplus that could be extracted from world commerce.
France under Louis XIV subsidized shipbuilding and increased port duties on foreign vessels. The Navigation Acts gave British ships (and merchants) a hammerlock on anything imported or exported by the British Empire. Most of the European wars of the 16th and 17th centuries, Mr. Kindleberger says, were in some way fought over who would skim the profits from foreign trade.
If the means seem disproportionate to the ends, you are on to something. For example, trade restrictions imposed on the American colonies were a serious irritant in the relationship with Britain and ultimately a catalyst for revolution. But Claudia Goldin, an economic historian at Harvard, notes that "when you go through the calculations, the gains to England and losses to the colonies were largely symbolic."
It is safe to assume that King George III didn't go through the calculations. Nor did the theoreticians of strong central government, whose rationale for restrictive trade gradually evolved from the 15th to the 18th centuries under the rubric of mercantilism.
 
War Chests
 Mercantilism held as paramount the economic interests of a nation as a whole, and had a strong protectionist bent. A central idea of the doctrine (one with modern echoes) is that it is better to export than to import. A trade surplus meant power, the logic went, because a nation would end up with more precious metals as currency. In time of war, the lucre could be used to hire mercenaries and buy weapons.
The catch is that the effort spent amassing a war chest meant less effort available to, say, grow food, build forts or invent the steam engine. Besides, precious metals can cause problems on their own: some economists believe that the conquistadors' success in pillaging Latin America weakened Spain by driving up the price of everything it bought with the gold.
Historians who wish to put a more rational spin on mercantilism point out that the raising of barriers against imports was usually linked to the dismantling of internal trade barriers. Federalists, led by Alexander Hamilton, left their mercantilist mark on the American economy by advocating a single strong currency and open interstate commerce while favoring protectionist tariffs on imports. But whether those policies aided or retarded the rise of America as a great economic power (the issue is in dispute), the country has certainly paid dearly in the process.
The tariff, Ms. Goldin says, was a source of bitter controversy between the industrial, protectionist North and the free-trade South in the decades preceding the Civil War. Indeed, one school of thought puts the tariff issue up there with slavery as a cause of the war. At the very least, it was a key to the South's fatal miscalculation that England would intervene on the side of the secessionists because they were more than willing to trade cotton for British goods.
Protectionism took a fateful turn this century, when the idea was explicitly linked to unemployment. The notion that trade created losers as well as winners had never been in doubt: "There's no question 19th century English landlords suffered from free trade in grain after the repeal of the Corn Laws," notes Mr. Krugman. But it was only with the Depression that nations designed employment strategies around the ideas of maximizing exports and minimizing imports.
 
Tamer Form of War
 Congressmen Smoot and Hawley, whose photo is now familiar to millions who watched the Nafta debate last week, may not rank as quite the villains that Vice President Al Gore made them out to be. But the industrial nations' mutually self-defeating efforts to "beggar thy neighbor" with protective tariffs surely was a shameless response to world economic catastrophe -- not to mention a catalyst to fascism in Europe.
With protectionist ideas so ingrained in the popular psyche, it may seem puzzling that the world has gone as far as it has in reducing barriers to trade in the last half century. One explanation is that Americans were the dominant exporters for most of the period, and the people and corporations that made big bucks exporting grain and jet planes were thus able to make the case for free trade on grounds of national interest. The other is the cold war: those who might have opposed the rise of Japan and Europe as trade competitors had an even greater stake in keeping their economies strong, to deter Soviet expansion.
Now that the Russian threat is gone and America is deeply in trade deficit, the defense of free trade in general and Nafta in particular must be made in broader economic terms. But paradoxically, Mr. Krugman says, the simplest yet most sophisticated case for free trade -- that voluntary market transactions, whether behind national borders or across them, always deserve the benefit of the doubt -- is so unintuitive that backers of free trade feel obliged to cloak their arguments in the oratory of mercantilism.
Nafta, we hear, will create American jobs, presumably at the expense of Mexican jobs, and make us more competitive, presumably at the expense of Japan. Thus even if he wins a squeaker this week in the House, Mr. Clinton will have reinforced the misperception that trade is a less malign form of warfare. "The obsession with competitiveness," writes Mr. Krugman, "is not only wrong but dangerous."

HEADLINE: The Art Market Bounces Back

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
The art market took a step forward during the two-week fine art auction marathon that ended Wednesday. After a severe three-year slump, consumer confidence is back. Buyers came out in droves to bid for every level of Impressionist, modern and contemporary art, although at prices below those of the great boom five years ago. "But we're beginning to see a breakthrough," said Christopher Burge, president of Christie's in New York.
For the last 18 months, Impressionist and modern art sales have shown a steady growth. Artists like Matisse, Degas and Pissarro sold particularly well this fall. At Christie's the 1885 Degas pastel, "Dancers Taking a Bow (The Ballerinas)," sold for $7 million. 
 At Christie's Tuesday night, Gorky's "Year After Year" sold for $3.8 million, a record for the artist. Sotheby's sale the following night set records too. The star work was Alexander Calder's 14-foot 6-inch standing mobile "Constellation," which brought $1.8 million.
The greatest success was the sale of 88 Picassos spanning the artist's career from 1899 to 1972. There was something for everyone -- from drawings valued at several thousand dollars to a painting that fetched $4.4 million. CAROL VOGEL

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
On a Divided Island, Two Estranged Peoples

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic

 BODY:
THOUGH Haitians and Dominicans inhabit the same Caribbean island, Hispaniola, they can scarcely be said to share it. Despite their proximity, differences of language, culture and race and, above all, the burden of their common history have conspired to make them less neighbors than virtual strangers and intermittent enemies. "We are two peoples who have distanced ourselves from one another," laments Max Puig, a member of the Dominican Senate who is also a sociologist, and few on either side of the border would disagree.
Unfortunately for the United States and the United Nations, that tradition has now become a factor complicating efforts to solve the crisis in Haiti and restore the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the country's democratically elected President, to power. Under intense international pressure to enforce an oil and arms embargo against Haiti's military rulers, the Dominican Republic, whose compliance is vital to that process, is dragging its feet, if not surreptitiously sabotaging sanctions that its leaders see as detrimental to Dominican interests. 
 At 87 years of age, the Dominican President, Joaquin Balaguer, has a more finely developed sense than most of his countrymen of the historical tensions between the two countries, and knows how to manipulate them to his advantage. More comfortable with the old Duvalier regime and its easily corruptible military heirs than with Mr. Aristide, Mr. Balaguer has raised the specter of embargo-induced mass starvation in Haiti triggering the one thing Dominicans dread most: a huge influx of poor and hungry Haitians across the border.
Haiti's relations with its larger, Spanish-speaking neighbor have long been marked by resentment and distrust. "For the most part, Dominicans regard Haiti as a country more African than Latin American, and therefore inferior," said a diplomat who has served in both countries. "Haitians, in turn, tend to think of Dominicans as a people unable to come to terms with their own blackness and harboring unreasonable pretensions to European grandeur."
Beginning with colonial times, there have always been such conflicts, with Spain and France jockeying for control of Hispaniola until the end of the 18th century, when Haiti fought for and won its independence. Arguing that the island was "one and indivisible," Haitian forces subsequently advanced into Santo Domingo and ruled this country from 1822 until 1844, a period called an "occupation" in Dominican textbooks but seen as a "liberation" by Haitians.
"The Haitian view is that we could not have a slave-holding European power on the other side of our border," said Paul Latortue, a Haitian economist who is an occasional adviser to Mr. Aristide on Caribbean affairs. "But people like Balaguer, the descendants of the old whites who had to flee when the Haitian forces arrived and then came back afterwards, see that not as an attempt to free the Dominican side from slavery, but as an imperialist move."
 
Vengeance
 The Dominican state exacted its revenge nearly a century later. In 1937, shortly after the border between the two countries was finally demarcated, the dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo uprooted thousands of Haitians living in the west of the country, killing many and forcing others to flee across the border. Only Haitians who worked as laborers on sugar plantations, and therefore vital to the Dominican economy, were spared.
That grisly episode, like the earlier period of Haitian rule, is playing a prominent role in the current Dominican presidential campaign. With six months to go before the election, Mr. Balaguer's chief rival is Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, 56, an ex-mayor of Santo Domingo. Born of Haitian parents who fled the slaughter and left him behind to be raised by a Dominican family, Mr. Pena Gomez has had both his citizenship and patriotism questioned by opponents.
This summer, for instance, Pedro Romero Confesor, the President's legal adviser, said that "anyone who wants to know if Pena Gomez is Haitian or Dominican only has to look at his face to form a judgment," a reference to Mr. Pena Gomez's dark skin and Negroid features. It would be "a national shame," Mr. Romero continued, "if after 22 years of Haitian occupation we were to have a Haitian president."
 
Virtual Slavery
 Of course, many Haitians are already living uneasily here, though exactly how many is in dispute. Each year, cane cutters are imported for the arduous sugar harvest -- work often described by human rights monitors as virtual slavery -- while other Haitians have become construction workers or domestics. In addition, Haitian market women who come here to buy goods not available in Port-au-Prince, known collectively as "Madame Sara," are often blamed for shortages and price rises, which are occurring now as Dominicans along the border profiteer from the embargo on Haiti.
Government officials suggest that as many as a million Haitians live here, many of them underground, but academic experts disagree. "To the extent that Balaguer can exaggerate the number, he can say that the problems and difficulties we are suffering in the Dominican Republic are due to the presence of the Haitians," said Carlos Dore Cabral, a Dominican sociologist.
Mr. Balaguer thus stands to benefit from any prolonging of the Haitian crisis, though perhaps not his country. "Many of the actions and attitudes of the President in the current situation are driven not only by the national interest, but by his political and party interests," said Mr. Puig, who backs neither Mr. Balaguer nor Mr. Pena Gomez. "He and his party are trying to keep alive the negative sentiments toward the people of Haiti and reinforce existing prejudices. That can only do damage to future relations between the two countries."

HEADLINE: What an Earlier Trade Pact Did Up North

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH

 BODY:
Almost five years after the United States-Canadian Free Trade Agreement took effect Jan. 1 1989, economists are uncertain of its impact on employment because Canada has just gone through a long recession. Some industries were unable to keep up in the more competitive trade environment, but job losses also came from a spillover of the American recession, an overvalued Canadian dollar and high interst rates.
 Daniel Schwanen, senior policy analyst at the C.D. Howe Institute, a Toronto research group that studies employment, estimates that of the nearly 350,000 manufacturing jobs lost in the last five years, as many as 100,000 were lost in labor-intensive industries as a result of the Free Trade Agreement. But he also estimates as many as 50,000 jobs have returned with export gains, chiefly in high technology services. 
 "My sense is that we're on the verge of even bigger increases and that if the current expansion continues, all the losses will be made up within the next year," he said in an interview. Until now companies have been able to meet much of the export growth through increased productivity, but, according to Mr. Schwanen, additional hires will be needed soon. CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH

HEADLINE: THE FREE TRADE ACCORD;
Workers on Free Trade: A Split Along Class Lines

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Nov. 13

 BODY:
Huffing and puffing to catch the 6 o'clock train bound for the woodsy North Shore suburbs, a lawyer with a briefcase slowed her pace long enough to praise the virtues of free trade. "We've got to keep up with the world," Leslie Sammarco said cheerfully, as she stepped on board. "It's just smart economic policy."
For the lawyers and stockbrokers and accountants rushing from Loop offices to the Northwestern Station one recent evening, support for the proposed North American Free Trade Agreement comes easily, or, as one pipe smoker in tweed said, it is "a no-brainer." 
 But from behind the safety glasses of Sharon Torian Jones, a 36-year-old union worker who cleans these train cars for $8 an hour, the issue looks starkly different.
 
Praise and Criticism
 "It's going to take our jobs away," said Ms. Jones, frowning under a yellow hard hat. "I know the rich people say it won't. But what do they care about working people? The only ones looking to protect people like us is the A.F.L.-C.I.O. And if the union says it's bad, I trust them. Got no reason to trust those other folks."
Perhaps no place more than Chicago offers so striking a relief map for the financial, intellectual and emotional currents swirling around the trade accord. This is a city of gleaming headquarters of Fortune 500 giants and graveyards of hollowed, shuttered factories, the home to so many Nobel economists and to so many graduates of the school of hard knocks.
As much as any issue in generations, the trade accord has prompted sentiments that seem to break along class lines throughout the country. And on the streets of Chicago, a city renowned for both its orchestra and its bare-wire blues, the debate boils down to the oldest division of all: the haves versus the have-nots, or more precisely, those who have only a little.
The pact has been heralded from the editorial offices of the neo-Gothic tower that houses The Chicago Tribune, from the ivy-walled halls of the University of Chicago, from the corporate boardrooms of Quaker Oats and United Airlines and Sara Lee.
But inside the bungalows and the two-flats and the shot-and-a-beer taverns of working-class Chicago, the trade agreement is being greeted with suspicion and outright disdain.
 
'It Doesn't Take a Genius'
 "It stinks," said Mike Burke, a bearish 42-year-old truck driver who sipped a beer under a picture of Rocky Marciano. "I work hard for a living. I didn't go to Oxford. I studied in Vietnam, if you know what I mean. Clinton doesn't know what it's like for a working man. I make 18 bucks an hour, and I'm just surviving. Now they're going to let these Mexican truckers come up here? You know what they make? Hey, it doesn't take a genius to figure out why these companies want this thing to go through."
He sat next to another trucker, Dennis McGue, who shook his head at what he called the "fancy-pants elites" who support the pact. "I guess when you live up on a hill," Mr. McGue said, "you just don't see the people in the valley."
A host of economic and foreign policy experts, meanwhile, have written position papers, delivered speeches and appeared on televised forums to insist that the agreement does not threaten the jobs of working people.
"I don't know of any serious economist who doesn't support Nafta," said Merton Miller, a Nobel economist at the University of Chicago, who recently appeared at the White House to promote the measure.
"Workers have to understand that nothing is going to happen with Nafta that wouldn't happen without Nafta," he said from his office on the Hyde Park campus. "Companies that want to go to Mexico are going to Mexico -- have already gone to Mexico. A lot of people are worried about keeping high wages for low-skilled jobs. And they should worry. In the modern world, those two things don't go together. But it's got nothing to do with Nafta. The jobs in the steel mills and the slaughterhouses didn't go away because of international trade. They disappeared because of technology. It's not Mexico. It's the machine."
For generations, the smokestacks that billowed soot over Lake Michigan symbolized the promise of prosperity to people without diplomas or special skills but with strong backs and a hard-nosed work ethic -- the impoverished refugees from Appalachian hollows and Mississippi cotton fields and villages of Europe.
The brawny Chicago of Carl Sandburg, "hog butcher for the world, tool maker, stacker of wheat," has been gone, of course, since before many of the young professionals now riding to work on the screeching El trains were even born. With its glittering Magnificent Mile shopping district and the high-technology companies sprouting beyond O'Hare Airport, the region today looks more like a city tuned to the rhythms of faxes and modems than a lunch-box factory town listening for the noon whistle.
The working-class anger over the trade agreement, in some ways, seems to represent a lament for those old days, when Chicago was known as "The City That Works," and almost anybody with a pair of steel-toed boots and some gumption could land a job with a decent wage. Just since 1980, Chicago has lost more than 200,000 factory jobs, and those who still have work have seen wages and benefits cut sharply. Companies negotiating for concessions from workers have routinely threatened to send jobs to Mexico, and in plenty of cases, they have.
The photograph that Ross Perot held up in his debate with Vice President Al Gore on Tuesday, showing an American factory near a shanty town in Mexico, showed a Zenith plant, union leaders here say, a company that once employed 14,000 workers in Chicago, and now has fewer than 300 union workers here.
But proponents of the trade pact say the example only proves their point: American companies do not need the agreement to send jobs across the border. Indeed, they say the pact would increase jobs in the United States, because goods produced here would no longer face such a stiff tariff.
"We'll be hiring a lot more Chicago workers with Nafta," said Jeff Victor, a 29-year-old vice president of a car wax company on the West Side. "We're selling in Mexico now. But the tariff is a killer. Get it removed, and bang, more trade, more money, more jobs right here at home."
 
What Jobs Next?
 But the workers cannot help but wonder: If so many jobs have already gone to Mexico, wouldn't an open border make it even easier to ship them away? Won't $3-an-hour Mexican workers start flooding the hiring offices of American companies? And what goes next after factory jobs? Claims processors? Data keypunch operators? File clerks?
American workers today are insecure. And they are bitter, especially since the shakeout in the 1980's, when companies seemed to sneer at unions.
"To tell you the truth, I can't make heads or tails out of this Nafta," said Jesse Diaz, freshly unemployed at 55, who still rises at 5 o'clock every morning to pull on a flannel work shirt and heat coffee for his thermos, a hard habit to break after 28 years as a factory worker. "All I know is this: I worked almost 30 years for the company, gave them everything I had. And then all of a sudden, my job is gone."
The politics of the agreement have turned familiar allegiances upside down. Usual foes like the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Pat Buchanan have joined sides in opposing the pact, while suburban Republicans are supporting the Democratic President. Some Chicagoans said they thought they would never see the day when a Mayor named Daley opposed the unions. Mayor Richard M. Daley, whose brother, William, directs the push for the pact for President Clinton, recently came out in favor of the accord.
"It's a strange mix, for certain," said Dennis Glynn, who sipped a white wine in the gentrifying Bucktown neighborhood, where taverns with signs that read Cerveza Fria and Zimne Piwo (Spanish and Polish for "cold beer") are being replaced with yuppie places like Cafe du Midi. "I'm a left-leaning lawyer from a working-class, Irish-Catholic background, and I'm gay, so my inclination is certainly to support the unions. But not this time. I'm for Nafta. I just don't think we can put up a wall around the country. But Chicago is running scared, just like every other city. People want to know: 'Where have the jobs gone? And how can we get them back?' "

HEADLINE: CLINTON DELIVERS EMOTIONAL APPEAL ON STOPPING CRIME

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEMPHIS, Nov. 13

 BODY:
From the pulpit of the church where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his last sermon, President Clinton warned black ministers today that the victories of the civil rights movement were being sullied by a "great crisis of the spirit that is gripping America today."
In an emotional appeal for people to take responsibility for the ills around them, Mr. Clinton said it would be hard to explain to the civil rights leader how crime and violence have soared even as blacks have won a larger role in American society. 
 "How would we explain that we gave people the freedom to succeed and we created the conditions in which millions abuse that freedom to destroy the things that make life worth living and life itself?" Mr. Clinton asked. As a white-robed choir sat in rapt silence behind him, he answered somberly, "We cannot."
 
Sense of Betrayal
 Mr. Clinton said he feared that if Dr. King could return to the pulpit today, he would feel a sense of betrayal. He might say, the President continued: "I fought to stop white people from being so filled with hate that they would wreak violence on black people. I did not fight for the right of black people to murder other black people with reckless abandon." [Excerpts, page 24.]
The White House had given no indication that Mr. Clinton intended to deliver a major address today. And the intensity of his remarks surprised even his aides, who said they had expected him to articulate the broad themes but not with such fervor.
But they added that the President's remarks reflected a welling-up of his concern about social ills and a new determination that his Administration be seen as addressing the crime problem head-on.
 
No Holding Back
 In the speech, Mr. Clinton said he had been personally moved by recent news accounts of violence among young people.
And as he stood before the ministers in the Temple Church of God in Christ in an economically depressed neighborhood of south Memphis, he did not hold back from vivid description of the violence that has plagued the black community more than any other. The President said he grieved that more than 37,000 Americans are killed each year by gunshot wounds and that 160,000 children stay home from school each day in fear of violence there. But he said that while passage of tough anti-crime legislation could help to limit the damage, lasting answers must come from within individuals and social institutions.
"I tell you, unless we do something about crime and drugs and violence that is ravaging our country, it will destroy us," Mr. Clinton said. He later vowed, "Somehow, by God's grace, we will turn it around."
For a President who tends to wrestle in many speeches with the arcana of public policy, Mr. Clinton's address to 5,000 ministers and other leaders gathered in the cavernous church was remarkable for its passion. His speech was interrupted by applause many times.
He was welcomed as "the first President of the United States to set foot in this holy place," and Mr. Clinton made clear that he recognized the significance of his visit to the last church in which Dr. King spoke on the night before his assassination more than 25 years ago. It was in that final appearance that Dr. King seemed to foresee his own death as he said he had seen the "promised land" but told the congregation, "I may not get there with you."
 
Feeling at Home
 Mr. Clinton clearly felt at home among the group, which was taking part in the 86th convocation of the Church of God in Christ, to whom he was introduced as Bishop Clinton. He said he recognized that he could not have won election last year without the support of blacks, and said he had done his best since taking office to keep the faith.
But Mr. Clinton seemed intent on being seen urging black Americans to assume greater responsibility for the problems in their communities.
It is a theme that has recently been taken up by prominent blacks like the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who terms efforts to stop violence the "new frontier of the civil rights movement."
While Dr. King could take pride in the election of black Americans to political office, in the expansion of opportunity for them and in the creation of a black middle class, Mr. Clinton said he otherwise might say:
"I did not live and die to see the American family destroyed. I did not live and die to see 13-year-old boys get automatic weapons and gun down 9-year-olds just for the kick of it. I did not live and die to see young people destroy their own lives with drugs and then build fortunes destroying the lives of others. That is not what I came here to do.
"I fought for freedom, he would say, but not for the freedom of people to kill each other with reckless abandonment, not for the freedom of children to have children and the fathers of the children walk away from them and abandon them as if they don't amount to anything. I fought for people to have the right to work, but not to have whole communities and people abandoned. That is not what I lived and died for."
Mr. Clinton said he hoped that passage of the crime bill, overhaul of the health care system and an expansion in American jobs could begin to mend what has been damaged. But he said that without changes "from the inside out," nothing that politicians might try could end what he later described as public pathology.
 
Discipline and Love
 "Where there is no hope, where there is no order, where we are reducing the size of our armed services because we have won the cold war, who will be there to give structure, discipline and love to these children?" Mr. Clinton asked the church leaders. "You must do that, and we must help you."
Crime is an issue that historically has held more appeal to conservatives, and the Administration's new emphasis on it may be intended, in part, as a foil to concerns that the attention to health care and other traditionally liberal programs reflects an outlook that is skewed to the left.
In remarks after the church address, Mr. Clinton recounted recent chilling news reports and said, "I can no longer justify going to bed at night thinking about these children killing other children, thinking about these little kids planning their own funerals and not doing something about it."
A day after the Justice Department began a criminal investigation into claims that Republicans funneled money to black ministers in New Jersey cities for their help in keeping the black turnout low -- and therefore the Democratic total down -- in the state's election for governor, Mr. Clinton made no mention of the incident, whose details remain murky but which has angered blacks.
 
Seeking Church's Help
 Mr. Clinton asked the Church of God in Christ, a denomination that counts five million members from 30,000 churches around the country, for its help "to make our people whole again."
Dr. King delivered his sermon in the church on April 3, 1968, the night before he was shot dead by James Earl Ray on the balcony of a Memphis motel. In that address, he told the congregation: "I just want to do God's will. And He's allowed me to go to the mountain. And I've looked over, and I've seen the promised land."
Mr. Clinton said this afternoon: "If you had told anybody who was here in the church on that night that we would abuse our freedom in that way, they would have found it hard to believe. And I tell you it is our moral duty to turn it around."

HEADLINE: C.I.A. Formed Haitian Unit Later Tied to Narcotics Trade

BYLINE: The following article was based on reporting by Stephen Engelberg, Howard W. French and Tim Weiner and was written by Mr. Weiner., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 13

 BODY:
The Central Intelligence Agency created an intelligence service in Haiti in the mid-1980's to fight the cocaine trade, but the unit evolved into an instrument of political terror whose officers at times engaged in drug trafficking, American and Haitian officials say.
American officials say the C.I.A. cut its ties to the Haitian organization shortly after the 1991 military coup against Haiti's first democratically elected President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
 Three former chiefs of the Haitian unit, the National Intelligence Service, known as S.I.N. from its initials in French, are now on the United States Treasury Department's list of Haitian officials whose assets in the United States were frozen this month because of their support for the military leaders blocking Father Aristide's return to power.
 
Analyses Are Criticized
 The disclosure of the American role in creating the agency in 1986 comes amid increasing Congressional and public debate about the intelligence relationship between the United States and Haiti, the richest and poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere.
Supporters of Father Aristide contend that the C.I.A. is undermining the chances for his return with analyses skewed by a misplaced trust in his military foes.
The agency paid key members of the junta now in power for political and military information up until the ouster of Father Aristide in 1991. A review of the C.I.A.'s activities in Haiti under the Reagan and Bush Administrations, based on documents and interviews with current and former officials, confirms that senior C.I.A. officers have long been deeply skeptical about the stability and politics of President Aristide, a leftist priest.
 
C.I.A. Help for Aristide
 No evidence suggests that the C.I.A backed the coup or intentionally undermined President Aristide. In fact, the agency has acted to help him at times, for example through a program that is now training bodyguards to protect him should he return to Haiti from his exile in the United States.
Though much of the C.I.A.'s activity in Haiti remains secret, the emerging record reveals both failures and achievements in recent years.
Having created the Haitian intelligence service, the agency failed to insure that several million dollars spent training and equipping the service from 1986 to 1991 was actually used in the war on drugs. The unit produced little narcotics intelligence. Senior members committed acts of political terror against Aristide supporters, including interrogations that included torture, and threatened last year to kill the local chief of the United States Drug Enforcement Administration.
On the other hand, United States officials said, one senior Haitian intelligence officer dissuaded soldiers from killing President Aristide during the 1991 coup. The C.I.A. also helped to save the lives of at least six Aristide supporters after the coup, evacuating them in a late-night rescue that involved the Navy's elite SEAL unit, officials said.
The C.I.A. also had a mixed track record in analyzing the fall of the 30-year Duvalier family dictatorship in 1986. The agency's analysts did not foresee the political violence that led to the collapse of elections in 1987 and the 1991 coup. But the analysts, contradicting the White House and the State Department, correctly predicted this year that the Haitian military would block President Aristide's scheduled return in October.
Members of the Congressional panels that oversee the C.I.A. say the agency's intelligence-gathering helped American policy makers bewildered by the political chaos that followed the fall of the Duvalier dictatorship, including a series of military coups, and by Father Aristide's overwhelming victory in the December 1990 election.
 
Lawmaker Cites C.I.A.'s 'Bum Rap'
 "The problems of Haiti are problems of policy, not intelligence," said Representative Dan Glickman, a Kansas Democrat who heads the House intelligence committee. "In some cases, intelligence gets a bum rap. From the interviews we've had with the agency, I don't get any feeling that our goal was to preserve military dictatorship in Haiti."
But Senator Christopher J. Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who received extensive briefings from the agency, asserted last week that the C.I.A.'s view of Haiti was distorted by its ties to the Haitian military. "A lot of the information we're getting is from the very same people who in front of the world are brutally murdering people," Senator Dodd said.
One crucial source of information for American intelligence over the years, according to two Government officials, was Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, who leads the Haitian armed forces. The officials said he provided the United States Government with reports critical of Father Aristide. The officials did not provide details from those reports. Nor did they say whether the general was paid.
In 1957, Francois Duvalier rose to power in Haiti. A corrupt dictator, he consolidated his power with the aid of a 10,000-member gang known as the Tontons Macoute.
Four years later, he was threatened by a C.I.A. covert operation in which the agency supplied arms to opponents plotting a coup, according to a 1975 Senate report. The plot failed.
On his death in 1971, Mr. Duvalier bequeathed his regime to his son, Jean-Claude, who received nearly $400 million in American economic aid until a popular revolt toppled his Government and he fled the country in February 1986.
Shortly afterward the C.I.A. created the Haitian intelligence service, S.I.N. The agency was staffed solely with officers of the Haitian Army, which was already widely perceived as an unprofessional force with a tendency toward corruption. The stated purpose was to stem the flow of hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of cocaine through Haiti, a crucial transit point for drug traffickers.
 
Money for Agency Despite Aid Curb
 The United States would gain information on the Haitian military by creating the unit; the Haitian military would obtain money, training and equipment from the C.I.A.
In intelligence parlance, it was a "liaison" relationship. The C.I.A. does not normally report to Congress on such relationships, citing the sensitivity of other nations to disclosures of secrets. That reduces the role of Congressional oversight.
S.I.N. received $500,000 to $1 million a year in equipment, training and financial support from the C.I.A., United States and Haitian Government officials say. The money may have sent a mixed message, for Congress was withholding about $1.5 million in aid for the Haitian military regime at the same time.
By late 1988, the agency decided to "distance itself" from the intelligence service, a senior United States official said. But the ties continued until October 1991, just after the Sept. 30 coup against Father Aristide, he said.
A 1992 Drug Enforcement Administration document described S.I.N. in the present tense, as "a covert counternarcotics intelligence unit which often works in unison with the C.I.A. at post."
The Haitian intelligence service provided little information on drug trafficking and some of its members themselves became enmeshed in the drug trade, American officials said. A United States official who worked at the American Embassy in Haiti in 1991 and 1992 said he took a dim view of S.I.N.
"It was a military organization that distributed drugs in Haiti," said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "It never produced drug intelligence. The agency gave them money under counternarcotics and they used their training to do other things in the political arena."
 
U.S. Drug Official Gets Death Threat
 "The money that was spent to train these guys in the counter-narcotics field boggled the mind -- half a million to a million a year," the official said. "They were turning it around and using it for political reasons, against whatever group they wanted to gather information on."
In September 1992, the work of United States drug-enforcement officials in Haiti led to the arrest of a S.I.N. officer on cocaine charges by the Haitian authorities.
A few days later, the Drug Enforcement Administration's chief in Haiti, Tony Greco, received a death threat on his private telephone line in the American Embassy. The caller identified himself as the arrested intelligence officer's superior, United States Government records show. Mr. Greco immediately left Haiti and has not returned.
Three former chiefs of the Haitian intelligence service -- Col. Ernst Prudhomme, Col. Diderot Sylvain and Col. Leopold Clerjeune -- were named by the United States Treasury Department in a Nov. 1 order for seizure of their assets in the United States. The document named 41 people "who seized power illegally," helped anti-Aristide forces or "contributed to the violence in Haiti."
Haitian officials say those S.I.N. officers persecuted Father Aristide's supporters and used their C.I.A. training to spy on them.
"They were heavily involved in spying on so-called subversive groups," an exiled member of the Aristide Government said. "They were doing nothing but political repression. Father Aristide was one of their targets. They targeted people who were for change."
Between 1 A.M. and 3 A.M. on Nov. 2, 1989, Colonel Prudhomme, who headed S.I.N. and held the title of chief of national security, led a brutal interrogation of Evans Paul, the Mayor of Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, according to a sworn deposition taken from Mr. Paul in connection with a Federal lawsuit filed against senior Haitian military officers in 1991 in Miami.
Colonel Clerjeune also was present at the interrogation, which left Mr. Paul with five broken ribs and internal injuries, the Mayor said.
Mr. Paul, who opposed the military regime, was arrested by soldiers, beaten and taken to the police headquarters in Port-au-Prince, where the beatings continued, according to sworn statements. When Mr. Paul lost consciousness, he said, he was revived by soldiers holding a flame from a cigarette lighter under his nose.
"Prudhomme himself never touched me," Mr. Paul said in an interview from Haiti. "He played the role of the intellectual, the man who searched carefully for contradictions in your account -- the man who seemed to give direction to the whole enterprise. He wanted to present me to the world as a terrorist."
"He seemed to have so much information about my life, all the way from my childhood," the Mayor said. "It was if he had been following me step by step."
Last summer, Mr. Paul met his interrogator again. Colonel Prudhomme was part of the military delegation led by General Cedras at talks mediated by the United Nations in July at Governors Island in New York. The accord reached at that meeting called for General Cedras to step down by Oct. 15 and allow Mr. Aristide to return on Oct. 30. The military reneged on the accord.
But S.I.N. also produced a success story: Col. Alix P. Silva, who led the Haitian intelligence service from 1986 to 1988. In 1988, Colonel Silva compiled a list of 18 senior Haitian military officials whom he said should be cashiered for unprofessional conduct, corruption or cocaine trafficking. At the head of the list was Lieut. Gen. Prosper Avril, who seized power in a 1989 coup.
Forced into hiding when General Avril took power, Colonel Silva resurfaced after the 1990 election, in which Father Aristide won 67.5 percent of the vote in a field of 10 candidates. The colonel then served as Deputy Commander in Chief of the army under General Cedras, who betrayed President Aristide by ousting him in September 1991.
It was Colonel Silva, current and former American officials say, who persuaded Haitian soldiers not to shoot Father Aristide on the night of the coup. Although briefly a member of the Cedras junta, Colonel Silva was among a handful of Aristide supporters who were evacuated shortly after the coup in a clandestine flight from Haiti that was coordinated by the C.I.A. and a team of Navy commandos, the officials said.
Though derring-do may be part of the C.I.A.'s image, the agency's most important task is helping American leaders understand what goes on in the world. Its intelligence analysts, not its spies, hold sway in Washington.
The agency's leading analyst of Latin American affairs, Brian Latell, traveled to Port-au-Prince in July 1992 and recorded his trip in a three-page note that he later shared with members of Congressional intelligence committees. He met with General Cedras, who he said impressed him as "a conscientious military leader who genuinely wishes to minimize his role in politics."
That impression, Father Aristide's supporters say, contributed to the faith placed in General Cedras by United States policy makers, a faith broken when the general abrogated the Governor's Island accord.
Mr. Latell also reported that he "saw no evidence of oppressive rule" in Haiti.
 
Rights Report Tells A Different Story
 "I do not wish to minimize the role the military plays in intimidating, and occasionally terrorizing real and suspected opponents," the analyst said, but "there is no systematic or frequent lethal violence aimed at civilians."
That conflicts with a State Department report for the same year, which said, "Haitians suffered frequent human rights abuses throughout 1992, including extra-judicial killings by security forces, disappearances, beatings and other mistreatment of detainees and prisoners, arbitrary arrests and detention and executive interference with the judicial process."
Mr. Glickman, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, defended Mr. Latell's work and said that no institutional bias afflicted the agency's reporting on Haiti.
But he said he had questions about "this whole counternarcotics involvement of the agency" and what good, if any, it achieved in Haiti.

HEADLINE: Clinton's Goals for Pacific Trade Are Seen as a Hard Sell at Summit

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 13

 BODY:
When President Clinton earlier this year invited the leaders of Asia to Seattle for an economic summit meeting, he was already talking about a "new Pacific community." Now he is hoping to show that the meeting, the first ever, can create jobs and wealth for America by linking it to economies that together control nearly half the world's output.
But if fusing the economic superstars of the Pacific Rim in a tight economic power bloc were that simple, it would have happened long ago, many officials from Tokyo to Jakarta argue. 
 Just beneath the veneer of cooperation among the 15 economies that make up the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum are conflicting interests and competition so intense that no Asian equivalent of the European Community will be possible for years, if ever, the officials say.
 
Moving Too Fast
 Cabinet ministers will begin to arrive on Wednesday, the day the House of Representatives votes on the North American Free Trade Agreement, and top leaders of the member nations will gather on Friday for bilateral meetings in preparation for their session on Saturday. The ministers will meet under the auspices of the forum, known as APEC, a four-year-old group that established a formal office only a year ago.
Even before the gathering begins on Wednesday, officials from all around Asia say they are increasingly suspicious about Washington's enthusiasm for turning the forum into an ambitious Asia-Pacific economic organization, intended to lead the way in trade liberalization.
Japan, which fought to make sure that the United States was not excluded from any Asian economic group, is now nervous that Washington is moving too fast, proposing free-trade rules and investment guidelines that could scare off smaller countries in Southeast Asia -- where Japan has a $30 billion investment.
China, the only socialist economy participating, is angling for regional trade rules that would prevent the Americans from holding its trade status hostage to its human rights and arms sales record. And countries are racing into Vietnam with the exception of the United States, whose continued economic restrictions on doing business there are clearing the way for major investors who see the country as the next great Asian economic miracle.
The Prime Minister of Malaysia, one of Asia's newest success stories, is boycotting the meeting planned for an island off Seattle. Mohamad Mahathir is refusing to attend, apparently out of pique over the treatment of his own plan for an Asian trade organization that would exclude Western nations.
Mr. Clinton faces a major challenge trying to turn the Seattle conference into a political success. Every issue about jobs and the flow of wealth raised in the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement looms even larger in the Pacific. Without scaring off his Asian guests, who already fear American domination, he will have to establish that a region that has traditionally viewed America as its best marketplace is now ready to buy far more American goods.
A senior Japanese official compared Clinton's concerns about North American trade to "worrying about a penny-ante card game" while the big money is being bet in the next room.
 
Fear of Exploitation
 But over the last few weeks, Asian officials have expressed alarm at the speed at which the United States appears to be seeking changes to achieve its goal. Some of the hesitations arerooted in memories of Western colonialism. Others fear that Mr. Clinton's enthusiasm is really an effort to extend its "results oriented" trade policies beyond Japan's shores.
"If there is any reservation, it is that Asians don't want to see Asia used as a means for American ambition," Kazuo Ogura, the director general of economic affairs at Japan's Foreign Ministry, said the other day. "Asia has been exploited before. And there is a contradiction in the American attitude that still disturbs people."
"It is fine that Americans want to get involved in this part of the world," said Mr. Ogura, who is known for his sometimes nationalistic-sounding views. "But on the other hand, there are some in America who still view economic progress in East Asia as a threat, and how to deal with that ambivalence is a problem we must deal with."
That concern has only been heightened by the fight over the North American Free Trade Agreement. Mr. Clinton repeatedly suggested that if the United States failed to approve the North American agreement, Japan would swoop in and steal Mexico away as an economic ally.
"Some of these remarks were very distasteful to us," one of the most senior officials in Japan's Foreign Ministry said here this week. "We have no such intentions."
 
Trade Within Region Booms
 Most of Japan's intentions, and Asia's, are closer to home. For the last two years, trade within the region has outstripped trade across the Pacific. With the United States now the ultimate market for only about a quarter of the area's goods, Asia is becoming economically more important to America just as America is becoming economically less critical to Asia.
That has not dampened the debate, however, over a report now circulating called "A Vision for APEC -- Toward an Asia Pacific Economic Community." The foreign and trade ministers themselves commissioned the study last year, and it was prepared by economists from around the region, headed by C. Fred Bergsten, the director of the Institute for International Economics in Washington and a former Treasury Department official in the Carter Administration.
Though it is vaguely worded on some controversial points, it recommends setting a target date for creating a sprawling free-trade zone throughout the Pacific, one member said recently, and explicitly uses the term "community" -- with a lower-case "c." Mr. Bergsten says the ultimate goal is to transform the organization "from a purely consultative forum to an action-oriented, substantive group."
Over time, the report suggests, the group would adjudicate trade disputes and set standards for everything from telecommunications equipment to environmental protection. It could also adopt trade liberalizations before they are adopted in worldwide forums like the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, thus forcing action on a broader scale.
That would be a huge change for the loosely organized group. Officially the United States has not said how much it would press the goals stated in the report. But it is not alone in seeking a more formal, action-oriented organization. Australia, which takes credit for getting APEC started, Singapore and South Korea are among those talking about moving relatively quickly.
"What we need to do," said Han Sung Joo, South Korea's Foreign Minister, "is to bring the Eastern Pacific and the Western Pacific together, to get America more committed to Asia, and to get Asia together."
But the other nations of the three-decade old Association of South-East Asian Nations -- especially Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia -- are more cautious. And Japan, careful about upsetting its new economic partners, has joined them.
"Both Indonesia and Thailand have recently reduced barriers to direct investment, and that was quite voluntary," said Ippei Yamazawa, a Japanese economist who served on the committee with Mr. Bergsten. "They are acting not because of pressure, but to make their goods competitive. We should let much of this happen by consensus, an Asian way."
None of the countries openly disagree with the goals in the report, as long as they are kept in the sufficiently distant future. But many Southeast Asian nations are already feeling overwhelmed by the crushing competition with Japan and the emergence of "Greater China" -- that is, the combination of Chinese labor and Taiwanese, Singaporean and Hong Kong capital.
Many of the poorer nations say it would be suicidal to drop all barriers to their markets now. They compare themselves to Japan in the 1950's, and say they want to follow a similar strategy of protection and industrial planning.
Thus, there is a growing fear that APEC will be hijacked by the United States and other Western powers, and turned into an organization that will be used to force open their markets prematurely.
The most vociferous in exploiting these fears is Dr. Mahathir, the Malaysian leader, who is little known in the West but whose voice is increasingly powerful in Asia. He has argued that the best economic organization for Asia would be one that excludes the United States, Canada, Australia and others that would impose Anglo-Saxon rules on the region. Inevitably, he argues, Western trading styles would give way to demands for Western-style governance -- stressing individual liberty to the detriment of economic development.
"They want us to practice the kind of democracy that brings about instability, economic decline and poverty," he complained recently in a speech to the country. "With this, they can threaten and control us."
While some dismiss his views as extreme, the Japanese and others say he reflects an undercurrent of thought that runs throughout the region.
 
Meeting Itself a Feat
 As a result, perhaps the most remarkable thing about what Mr. Clinton's aides are calling a leaders' meeting -- they have steered clear of the word summit for fear it would suggest formal decision-making -- is that it is happening at all. Though Asia often seems like a coherent geographic and economic entity from afar, to Asians themselves it has always defied a unity -- even when Japan controlled huge swaths of the region half a century ago.
That has only begun to change in the last decade or so, as the market has begun to accomplish what governments could not. The European Community was created by government agreement. But the modern unifiers of Asia are companies like Toyota and Matsushita, as is evident to anyone who has witnessed Malaysian workers singing their Japanese company songs at daybreak on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur. They have begun to organize different countries to supply different products, either back to Japan or for export to the West.
Now much the same is happening with Greater China, the term being used to describe the combination of mainland Chinese labor and capital and technology from Taiwan and Hong Kong. By some estimates Taiwan has already invested between $5 billion and $9 billion in the mainland, despite all the official legal barriers. The power of Chinese money, and the family relationships that link them together, has so alarmed Japan that Tokyo is suddenly pouring billions of dollars into China even while investment in factories in Japan and the United States has dropped off dramatically.

HEADLINE: Marital Status Ruled Irrelevant in Deportation

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 13

 BODY:
An immigrant's status as an unwed father was none of the Government's business and should not have been cited as a reason to deport him after a drug conviction, a Federal appeals court has ruled.
Citing recent laws that repealed previous bans on immigration by adulterers, homosexuals and polygamists, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit said Congress had determined that "private sexual conduct among consenting adults should no longer be considered a legitimate basis for making immigration decisions." 
 In fact, the court said, a genuine parent-child relationship, regardless of marital status, must be regarded under the law as a factor against deportation.
The court also said the Board of Immigration Appeals appeared to be taking an overly narrow view of evidence of rehabilitation by an alien who has been convicted of a crime.
The unanimous ruling, first released on Oct. 8, was reissued in amended form on Friday.
The case involved Rigoberto Yepes-Prado, 38, an East Palo Alto resident and an employee of a San Jose meat market. He entered the United States legally from Mexico with his family in 1974 but has remained a Mexican citizen.
In 1986 Mr. Yepes-Prado pleaded guilty in Superior Court to possession of about a half-ounce of heroin for distribution and spent eight months in jail. Under Federal law, a noncitizen can be deported because of a drug conviction, but deportation is mandatory only if the prison term is five years or longer.
 
'Anti-Social Behavior'
 An immigration judge found several factors in Mr. Yepes-Prado's favor, including a history of legal residence and employment, strong family ties and the lack of any other criminal record, but he ordered deportation anyway. Besides the drug conviction, the judge said Mr. Yepes-Prado had shown "anti-social behavior" by fathering three children out of wedlock.
Asked why he had not followed the judge's previous order to marry the children's mother, Mr. Yepes-Prado said the woman was not sure she wanted to marry.
The appeals court said the immigration judge should have disregarded Mr. Yepes-Prado's marital status and considered his undisputed parent-child relationships and economic support for his children as a positive factor. It ordered reconsideration of the case by the Board of Immigration Appeals, which had upheld the judge's ruling.
"Private sexual conduct between consenting adults cannot be considered as a negative factor in an immigration proceeding, at least absent specific Congressional authorization," said the opinion by Judge Stephen Reinhardt.
He said Congress had shown its intent since 1981 by repealing other laws that prohibited immigration because of private sexual activity. Immigration law also specifies that "a family relationship is to be counted as a positive factor," Judge Reinhardt said.
 
Lack of Criminal Record
 In addition, he rejected the board's conclusion that no evidence of rehabilitation appeared on Mr. Yepes-Prado's record. Rehabilitation can be shown by an absence of criminal conduct after release from jail, Judge Reinhardt said, noting that Mr. Yepes-Prado had no subsequent criminal record, had attended a rehabilitation program and had submitted several testimonials to his good character.
Mr. Yepes-Prado's lawyer, Martin Guajardo, said the ruling was important for legal residents who have criminal convictions.
Because of the ruling, Mr. Guajardo said, "I think they now have a better chance of being able to show rehabilitation and being permitted to stay in the United States." He said the appeals court had also put immigration judges on notice that family relationships were a positive factor, even if a judge considered an immigrant "culturally misaligned."
Mr. Guajardo said that the Justice Department had told the court it wanted the ruling reconsidered and that the department was awaiting instructions from Solicitor General Drew S. Days 3d on whether to appeal further.

HEADLINE: U.S. Officials Reveal Clues That Led to Brink's Suspects

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
Federal investigators who seized three men and recovered millions of dollars in one of the nation's largest armored car company robberies unveiled a web of evidence yesterday linking the suspects to one another and to money orders, new bank accounts, duffel bags full of cash, a new car and sunny vacation trips.
The suspects seized in New York City and Rochester on Friday night in the $7.4 million Brinks depot holdup in Rochester in January -- a priest, an illegal Irish immigrant with a criminal record and a retired police officer who was a Brink's guard at the time of the holdup -- are known to espouse the Irish Republican Army cause in Northern Ireland. 
 But Sinn Fein, the I.R.A.'s political arm, and Noraid, which raises money in the United States for families of Irish prisoners, disavowed any connection with the robbery or the suspects. And Federal investigators said they knew of no direct link between the men and the I.R.A. and had no evidence that any of the stolen money went to the rebel cause.
"We do not know at this time if it was intended for the I.R.A.," William Y. Doran, a special agent in charge of the criminal division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's New York office, said at a news conference at which piles of money -- duffel bags and suitcases full of it -- were displayed, and the details of a nine-month undercover investigation were disclosed.
 
Postal Money Orders
 Mr. Doran and other officials said that postal money orders, some for as much as $4,000, had been bought by the suspects while they were under surveillance. Postal money orders have serial numbers that can be traced, and investigators said it might be possible in coming days to determine where they were cashed.
If links to the I.R.A. are established, other investigators said, the case could signal a major shift in tactics by supporters of the Irish cause in the United States, who have largely confined their activities to legal fund-raising for the I.R.A.'s Provisional wing, or political arm, though some cases of arms shipments to Northern Ireland have come to light in this country.
One suspect, the Rev. Patrick M. J. Moloney -- a 61-year-old Melkite priest who was born in Ireland and arrested there in 1980 on a charge of attempting to smuggle weapons into Ireland for the I.R.A. -- was held in lieu of $1 million bail at an arraignment yesterday before Chief Magistrate A. Simon Chrein in Federal Court in Brooklyn.
"We're with you, Paddy!" supporters and relatives shouted as the short, gray-haired priest was led out of the courtroom.
 
Time in Irish Prison
 Samuel I. Millar, 38, who served at least six years in an Irish prison on explosive and firearms charges and for membership in the outlawed I.R.A., and who was smuggled into the United States in 1984, was held without bail by the chief magistrate, who said the defendant "represents a signficant risk of flight."
The third suspect, Thomas F. O'Connor, 54, who retired in 1982 after 20 years as a Rochester police officer, met Mr. Millar on a trip to Ireland a year later and became a Brink's guard three years ago. He was arraigned in Rochester Friday night and was also held without bail.
All three were charged with receiving or possessing stolen money, which carries a penalty of 10 years in prison and a $5,000 fine. None were accused of direct participation in the robbery, but officials said further charges might be made in the case, which broke late Friday night with coordinated raids at the suspects' homes and other places that had been under surveillance.
Standing before bundles of $5, $10, $20 and $50 bills -- many still in Brink's bags or packed in duffel bags and suitcases -- Mr. Doran and other investigators said that the money had been traced to the robbery through serial numbers. Most of it was found in an apartment on the Lower East Side.
 
Half of Stolen Cash Missing
 The investigators did not emphasize the Irish ties of the arrested men and declined to say if more arrests were expected, though they said the inquiry was continuing. Noting that only about half of the stolen cash had been found, they said it was unclear what had happened to the millions still missing.
But the investigators sketched a detailed picture of what they called an inside job at the Brink's depot and gave an elaborate account of nine months of intensive undercover surveillance, during which the suspects, all apparently unemployed, met frequently, bought money orders, opened bank accounts, bought a car, and paid for vacations in Hawaii and Florida, all with cash.
Officials said two men wearing ski masks and armed with handguns entered the Brink's depot in Rochester, a transfer point for money collected from businesses and banks, on the night of Jan. 5 and confronted three guards, including Mr. O'Connor. No alarms were triggered, and the gunmen bound the guards, collected $7.4 million in cash and took Mr. O'Connor away in handcuffs, later dropping him off five miles away.
Almost from the start, investigators said they suspected Mr. O'Connor had been in on the holdup. They said he gave inconsisent, erroneous and misleading accounts of what happened, declined for four days to give a sworn statement and refused to take a lie-detector test.
 
 Investigators also learned that Mr. O'Connor had been active in Noraid, raising money for the Irish cause, and had helped smuggle Mr. Millar into this country a decade ago.
Mr. Millar, a native of Belfast, Northern Ireland, had been refused an entry visa because of his criminal record. His wife, Bernadette Fennell, also entered the United States in 1984 on a visa that has since expired. Mr. Millar and Ms. Fennell lived at various locations in Rochester and New York and both were associated with Noraid, investigators said.
After investigators discovered that tire marks found at the robbery scene were similar to treads on a 1984 Plymouth Voyager minivan owned by Mr. Millar, a surveillance of Mr. Millar, now living in Queens, and of Mr. O'Connor was begun on Feb. 9.
Later that month, Mr. Millar and Ms. Fennell and their children went to Florida on a vacation paid for in cash. In July Ms. Fennell and a friend, Margaret Booth, took a vacation in Hawaii, also paid for in cash, investigators said.
 
Various Bank Accounts
 In March, investigators said, Mr. Millar opened bank accounts in various names with $25,000 in cash and was later seen purchasing numerous postal money orders, some for up to $4,000. Officials said neither he nor his wife were employed, but Mr. Millar's lawyer, Frank Durken, said he operated a comic book shop store and was hard working.
During the summer, the investigators said they saw Mr. Millar with Father Moloney, the director of Bonitas House of the Lazarus Community, a shelter for troubled teen-aged boys. Though arrested in Ireland in 1980 on weapons charges, he was not prosecuted, though his brother, John, was found guilty and jailed.
Father Moloney, who was seized at home at 606 East Ninth Street, bought a 1993 Ford Explorer minivan for $26,000 in cash on June 23, but only Mr. Millar was seen driving the vehicle later, officials said.
In August, investigators focused on a 10th-floor apartment at 330 First Avenue near East 19th Street, where Mr. Millar was seen entering with nylon duffel bags and Father Moloney with a backpack. The apartment's resident, Charles McCormick, 29, was taken into custody briefly yesterday, but was released without charges. Officials said his flat had apparently been used in his absence and without his knowledge to store and count the money.
 
350 Pounds of Cash
 In a raid at the apartment Thursday, investigators said they found card tables, an electronic money counter, and duffel bags and suitcases full of cash -- so much that they described it by weight rather than dollar value, which had not been determined late yesterday.
"I would say that roughly half has been recovered, but we cannot say that definitely until the money has been counted professionally, which will not be done until early next week," Mr. Doran said. He said the money was "in excess of 350 pounds."
As for the missing cash, he said: "I don't have any idea where the other half of the money is. In view of the spending habits of these people and the obvious purchase of large numbers of money orders, I'm sure much of it has been spent."

HEADLINE: True or False, Account Leaves Ministers Stung

BYLINE: By KIMBERLY J. McLARIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Nov. 13

 BODY:
Either way, says the Rev. DeForest B. Soaries Jr., the damage has been done.
Whether one believes Edward J. Rollins Jr. when he said this week that the campaign of Christine Todd Whitman had funneled money to black ministers so they would not urge their congregants to vote, or believes Mr. Rollins when he later retracted the comments, angry ministers say one thing is clear: Mr. Rollins has diminished the credibility of the black clergy at a time when blacks can least afford it. 
 "It's devastating," Mr. Soaries said. "I've gotten calls from my own members, who know I talked with Mrs. Whitman and Florio before the election. They call me to say, 'Reverend, how much money did you get?' "
 
Having to Defend Honor
 Mr. Soaries, pastor of the 3,500-member First Baptist Church of Lincoln Garden in Somerset, Middlesex County, said he tells his questioning members that "unequivocally not only did I not receive any money," he does not believe any black minister in New Jersey did either. And because his congregation knows him and because, he said, he climbed into the pulpit the Sunday before Election Day and preached about the desperate need to vote, he thinks his flock will believe him. But the very fact that he must defend his honor is insulting, he said.
"How do you quantify the damages?" he said. "There is no way to measure it. All over the state I talked to ministers and they are outraged about the fact they have now been placed in a situation to appear to be money-grabbing political opportunists."
Mr. Rollins, who served as campaign manager for Mrs. Whitman, boasted on Tuesday that the campaign had used $500,000 in "walking-around money" to pay black ministers and Democratic Party workers in exchange for promises not to rally votes for Gov. Jim Florio. The next day, he retracted his remarks and issued an apology through an irate Governor-elect Whitman, saying his comments were "an exaggeration that turned out to be inaccurate."
 
Vital and Stricken Force
 Still, the comments struck at an institution that remains very important to many black Americans. A 1988 Gallup poll found that 57 percent of all respondents and 75 percent of black respondents agreed with the statement "religion can answer all or most of today's questions."
And as an institution, the importance of the black church rises beyond even the issue of spirituality. For many blacks, the church is a haven, a source of strength and understanding, a second home.
"Many, many years ago, no matter what the age of the man, he was 'boy' all week," said the Rev. John Harris Jr., pastor of Galilee Baptist Church in Trenton and a native of Arkansas. "But when he came to church on Sunday morning he was Mr. Somebody, Deacon Somebody, Reverend Somebody. Here was the one place we could walk on equal ground."
 
Less Dominant a Force
 But even as individual churches still thrive, the vision of the church as the dominant institution in black neighborhoods has diminished. Many congregations are filled with women and older members, and have few younger men. Mr. Soaries and others said that while the church is struggling to combat the violence and drugs devastating black neighborhoods, the implication that black ministers can be bought is destructive.
"Anything that assaults the credibility of a basic institution like the black church is very dangerous to the black community," said the Rev. Joseph Lowery, president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.
"Unless they defend themselves, unless they make this out a lie, it could severely damage the clergy," Mr. Lowery said. "I personally don't believe it. I find it incredible that any minister would accept money to keep people from the polls."
Mr. Soaries said that at his church, members often go out recruit young men they find loitering on the street, unemployed and uninvolved.
 
'A Breach Between the People'
 "We invite them to buy into a new life style predicated on a value system that says it is more honorable to make $5 an hour working in McDonald's than $500 an hour selling drugs," he said.
"Our entire message is undermined by the notion that we are dishonorable," he said. "It creates a breach between the people who need us most and the institution that represent a hope for the people."
But former Representative William H. Gray 3d, who is now president of the United Negro College Fund and is the pastor of a Philadelphia church, said it was "nonsense" to suggest that all black clergy had been tainted by the incident, even if Mr. Rollins's original comments were true.
"That would be paramount to saying one corrupt doctor makes all doctors corrupt," he said.
Mr. Gray did not comment on the truth or falsity of Mr. Rollins's remarks, but he said the real issue was whether or not Whitman workers paid money to have people refrain from encouraging others to vote.
 
'Tragic for Democracy'
 "If it occurred it would be tragic for democracy and tragic for those who participated in it," he said. "If their names are ever revealed I think the community will take its own punishment." But several ministers said the original comments had already sown seeds of doubt.
Mr. Harris said that when he returned home Thursday evening his wife told him their phone had been ringing all day.
"She said the children had called her wanting to know how could a preacher do such a thing?" he said.
Mr. Soaries said a woman called him Friday morning, anxious because her church had received an anonymous $10,000 donation. She was convinced it had come from the Whitman campaign. But he said the church pastor told him the money came from a member whose husband had died. Now that minister must decide whether to protect the woman's anonymity and risk suspicion among his members, or to break his word and reveal the source of the gift.
 
Crises of Faith
 Even the faithful can have crises of faith. Although he has come to believe that Mr. Rollins's comments are untrue, Mr. Harris said he did not immediately dismiss them.
"No, to be truthful I didn't," he said. "To any rule, there's always the exception. But the rule is it just does not happen because too many people look up to their clergy as leaders. Too much has been entrusted to us."
Mr. Harris, a Florio supporter, said he does not like politics from the pulpit. But he did urge his congregation to vote, and he will raise politics again this Sunday, he said.
"I will go to my pulpit and I will tell my young people to have faith in the Lord and in their clergy," Mr. Harris said. "Because the vicious vile tongue of one man does not make it so for a whole people."

HEADLINE: The Supercollider's Demise Disrupts Many Lives and Rattles a Profession

BYLINE: By MALCOLM W. BROWNE

 BODY:
Still stunned by the Congressional decision last month to terminate the $11 billion Superconducting Supercollider project, hundreds of scientists are casting about for new positions in high-energy physics, in hopes not only of pursuing their profession but also of continuing to support their families.
But their prospects seem bleak.
Many of the 200 or so physicists dispossessed by the demise of the big Texas accelerator hope to find jobs at CERN, Europe's premier accelerator laboratory, on the border of France and Switzerland near Geneva. CERN now seems destined to be the world's center for high-energy physics research well into the 21st century. 
 For the last decade, CERN has been the leading competitor of America's major accelerator laboratories, and if the Europeans succeed in building their Large Hadron Collider at CERN, which is scheduled for completion in 2002, CERN will move into a pre-eminent position in this field of research.
The Hadron collider, like the supercollider, will smash beams of protons together in the hope of revealing the mysterious mechanism that gives mass to all matter. But the Hadron collider will be far less powerful than the supercollider, and many physicists give it only about one chance in three of finding this scientific quarry, known as the Higgs mechanism. Physicists say they believe that the supercollider's energy would certainly have shed light on the Higgs mechanism, and that if a special particle associated with this mechanism exists it would have been found.
 
Problems of Its Own
 CERN itself has financial problems because of the European recession, and unless the United States Congress chooses to grant American scientists substantial dowries to take to the European laboratory, employment prospects there seem poor.
Dr. Christopher Llewellyn Smith, the British physicist who will become CERN's director on Jan. 1, said in an interview, "We must try to find a way to make it possible for many of our stranded American colleagues to come to CERN." But, he added, "this will take difficult negotiations, because it's quite obvious that there would have to be financial contributions from the United States" to pay for the added CERN staff and the experiments that they would undertake.
The demise of the supercollider project, Dr. Llewellyn Smith said, "will be a catastrophe if it turns out to mean that the United States is leaving the field of high-energy physics, which that country pioneered."
 
Blessing or Curse?
 Dr. Stanley G. Wojcicki, who is a professor of physics at Stanford University and the chairman of the High- Energy Physics Advisory Panel -- a group of physicists who advise the Department of Energy and other Federal agencies -- says that there is little left of the Federal funding pie to divide up. "Congress has spoken rather firmly that this country is not willing to embark on any large scientific projects," he said.
Such views are by no means those of all scientists, many of whom regard the passing of the supercollider as a blessing.
Delighted by the recent action of Congress, Dr. Rustum Roy, a professor of materials science at Pennsylvania State University, said in an interview that "this comeuppance for high-energy physics was long overdue."
 
Discouraging Scientists
 Dr. Roy expressed the view of many scientists that "there is an acute oversupply of scientists in the United States," and that it is the responsibility of the educational system to try to reduce it.
But to Dr. Roy Schwitters, who was replaced as director of the supercollider last week, the United States is about to lose "the best and brightest" of its high-energy physicists.
"But for most of the thousand or so scientific and engineering staff members of the S.S.C., the future is terrifying," he said, referring to the supercollider. "Many have sunk their life savings into houses near Waxahachie, and now they face jobless futures in a collapsing real estate market."
Among the victims of the supercollider demise, he said, are 180 foreign scientists, many of them Russians, who are working in Texas on visitor visas. They will presumably have to leave the United States soon. "We talk a lot about finding alternative work for ex-Soviet nuclear weapons scientists, to keep them from working for terrorist states," Dr. Schwitters said, "and that's exactly what we were doing."
 
A Costly End
 Dr. Schwitters believes that Congress is unlikely to provide the financial contribution that the European research consortium will demand in exchange for hiring American physicists. "Congress won't spend the money in Texas, so why would they spend it in Switzerland?" he asked.
The cost overruns that plagued the supercollider in life seem likely to affect even its funeral. Congress voted to provide $640 million to close the project down, but it appears that this will not be nearly enough. Environmental regulations, for instance, will require the filling-in of all the tunnels and shafts already completed for the supercollider, which was to have been 54 miles in circumference. This will be costly. Dr. Wojcicki said he had seen estimates as high as $1.5 billion.
Other problems that will have to be resolved include the disposition of the land that was seized from private owners to make way for an accelerator that occupies most of Ellis County, Tex., as well as the hundreds of houses that were moved off the site and onto tracts of storage land. The large factories built at the supercollier site to mass-produce huge superconducting magnets, as well as a stockpile of completed magnets, will have to be dismantled and, presumably, sold for scrap.
Dr. Schwitters, however, said he hoped that the uncompleted site and its materials could be kept intact for scientists in the future who might be able to resume the supercollider's work.
 
Others Could Benefit
 Perhaps the one bright spot that accelerator scientists see in the supercollider demise is the possibility that Congress will spend some of the savings on other physics projects.
Leading the list of potential applicants is Fermilab in Illinois, which is still the highest-energy accelerator in the world. Scientists believe that Fermilab's Tevatron accelerator has a reasonable chance of finding the "top" quark -- the only one of the six hypothesized quark types that has not yet been discovered. Fermilab's decade-long quest for the elusive quark has so far failed to find conclusive evidence of its existence.
Finding the top quark would neatly fill out the "Standard Model," the generally accepted theory of how the basic building blocks of matter fit together. With luck, Fermilab might also find evidence of "supersymmetry," a theoretical mechanism that might relate the force of gravity with the three other known forces of nature: the electromagnetic force, and the strong and weak nuclear forces.
 
Quarks, Matter and Antimatter
 But the Tevatron's two trillion electron-volts of colliding energy have so far failed to reveal the top quark or supersymmetry, and physicists believe the accelerator's colliding particle beams may not contain enough protons to yield a good statistical chance of success. For this, the machine needs a new "main injector," and the hope is that additional money will be found to hasten completion of the main injector.
Another promising accelerator project, the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center's "Asymmetric B-factory," will get $237 million in Federal money, President Clinton announced on Oct. 4. One of the objects of this project is to discover why the newborn universe seems to have contained slightly more matter than antimatter. This assumption explains why, after the primordial matter and antimatter annihilated each other, a small residue of matter was left over, from which the present-day universe formed.

The Sad, Angry Vigils at Rifkin's Court Hearings

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON

DATELINE: MINEOLA, L.I.

 BODY:
Ever since Joel Rifkin was arrested in June and confessed to killing 17 women, Margarita Gonzalez has missed only one of his court appearances in the nine counties where he said he disposed of his victims' bodies.
"And that one hearing was way out in Riverhead in Suffolk County," she said. "I'm sorry I missed it, but I think Jenny would understand." 
 Jenny Soto, her 23-year-old sister, was among the young women strangled by Mr. Rifkin and listed in his confession, the police said. Her body was found in the Harlem River in May 1992.
"It's his hands that I can't take," she said during a break Friday in a weeklong pretrial hearing in which Mr. Rifkin's lawyer sought to have his client's grisly confession declared inadmissible.
"I'm O.K. except when I see the hands that killed my sister," she said. "Then I want to put my own hands around his neck. The only way we're ever going to get justice is when he is dead."
Ms. Gonzalez, who lives in Brooklyn and is studying to become a computer operator, traveled to the courthouse here by bus and train, a trip that took more than two hours. She sat in a front-row seat, less than 15 feet behind the defense table, where Mr. Rifkin, wearing rumpled tan trousers, a gray sweater and gold-rimmed glasses, sat slumped in his chair, his eyes avoiding those of Ms. Gonzalez and her new friend, Zaida Dandridge.
Mrs. Dandridge, who lives in nearby Rockville Center and is a New York City housing police officer, is the sister of 25-year-old Iris Sanchez, another woman thought to be a victim of Mr. Rifkin, whose body was found near Kennedy International Airport in June.
"I think he killed more than 17," Mrs. Dandridge said. "How can anyone believe he's telling the truth?"
Ms. Gonzalez and Mrs. Dandridge, who often come to the courthouse with their mothers, said they could not understand why the courts were taking so long to put Mr. Rifkin in prison, since he had already signed a confession admitting to 17 murders.
They sat patiently throughout Friday's hearing, during which the defense lawyer, Michael Soshnick, questioned the methods used by the chief investigator, C. Thomas Capers, the New York State police officer who took charge of the arrest of Mr. Rifkin on the morning of June 28 and obtained his confession.
 
Attacking the Confession
 Mr. Soshnick, who walks to the courthouse from his offices across the street on Old Country Road, spent the entire day trying to discredit the methods by which Mr. Capers obtained Mr. Rifkin's 12-page confession. It includes detailed information about his victims, where he picked them up and where he buried their bodies in graves throughout the New York area.
Mr. Rifkin, a 34-year-old unemployed landscaper, was arrested after a high-speed chase that began when troopers tried to stop him for a routine traffic violation. The chase ended when he ran into a utility pole near here at Old Country Road and Washington Avenue. The corpse of a Manhattan woman, Tiffany Bresciani, 22, was found wrapped in a blue plastic tarpaulin bag in the back of his van.
Mr. Capers, who first took the witness stand on Wednesday, told the court under direct questioning by Fred Klein, the assistant Nassau County district attorney, that Mr. Rifkin had admitted shortly after his arrest to killing Miss Bresciani, but declined, at first, to answer questions about other killings.
"I said, 'Mr. Rifkin, why can't you answer the question yes or no,' and there was no answer." Mr. Capers said Mr. Rifkin's continued silence aroused his suspicions.
He said he then began a guessing game with the suspect, asking him if he had killed more than 10 people, more than 20 people, or more than 10 but fewer than 20.
After admitting to killing two other women he had picked up in Suffolk County, Mr. Capers encouraged him to go on, saying it would be "a good time to clear his conscience and get it off his chest." He said it would be a way he could help the families of his victims and end his troubles sleeping at night.
"You want these people to have a proper burial, don't you," Mr. Capers said he asked Mr. Rifkin.
Mr. Rifkin then admitted to killing the 17 women, using a calendar and maps provided by the police to show where they were buried. He wrote it all down, reviewed it with the police and signed it.
But Mr. Soshnick is now attempting to establish in court that the arresting officers illegally searched the van and failed to read Mr. Rifkin his rights, informing him that he had the right to a lawyer and that anything he might say could be used against him in a court of law.
 
An Unaccustomed Witness
 Mr. Klein was the first person from the Nassau County District Attorney's Office to arrive at the scene of Mr. Rifkin's arrest on June 28, and could soon find himself in the unusual position of being on the witness stand, questioned by Mr. Soshnick about the arrest and confession.
Mr. Klein said outside the courtroom on Friday that he hopes Mr. Soshnick will, instead, place Mr. Rifkin on the witness stand.
"I doubt he'll do it, but you never know," he said. "There is no precedent when it comes to serial murder cases."
Mr. Klein said the police had "probable cause" to search Mr. Rifkin's van without a search warrant. He said the officer who opened the plastic bag and found the body did so because the shape in the bag was that of a human body and the smell coming from the bag was recognized by the officer as that of decaying human flesh.

HEADLINE: THE FREE TRADE ACCORD;
TRADE PACT GOING TO MEXICAN SENATE

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Nov. 12

 BODY:
While all eyes are focused on Washington for next week's key House vote on the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Mexican legislature also is expected to take up the pact, although the only suspense here is how long opposition parties will spend denigrating the Government before the agreement is approved.
In Mexico, the agreement is considered a treaty and would have to be approved by a two-thirds vote of the 64-member Mexican Senate. The party of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, controls 61 of the 64 seats. 
 Of the three opposition party members, the two belonging to the Democratic Revolutionary Party are expected to hammer out a long line of complaints against the treaty and the Salinas administration, which has supported it from the beginning.
"There are people in North America, Mexico and Canada who have reservations about the treaty, but they haven't been heard," said Porfirio Munoz Ledo, the leader of the opposition and a member of the Senate who said he opposes this agreement but supports economic integration between Mexico and the United States. "What the Mexican Senate does is irrelevant. They are an executive branch, not a legislative branch. They receive orders from the President and that's it."
 
An Invitation to Gore
 Mr. Munoz Ledo said the only debate that mattered would be among officials of the Mexican, Canadian and United States governments, and he invited Vice President Al Gore to discuss the free trade agreement with him publicly. "Something like that is the only possible alternative," he said.
Strictly speaking, the Mexican Senate has no chance to revise the treaty. Its role is restricted to examining the pact to determine if any of its provisions violate the Mexican Constitution. If they do not, the Senate, according to Mexican law, is bound to approve the treaty.
Carlos Fereya, a spokesman for the Senate, said a vote had not been scheduled until now because it had taken so long for the members to go through the 2,000-page agreement.
"We ought to be ready to present it to the full Senate sometime in the next week," Mr. Fereya said, possibly on Tuesday, before the House of Representatives votes in Washington on Wednesday.
But many Mexican political analysts think it is unlikely that the Senate would do anything to embarrass President Salinas, who has made the trade agreement a priority of his Administration.
 
'A Safe Shot'
 "The reason is very simple," said Juan Molinar, a professor of political science at the Colegio de Mexico, a research-oriented institution in Mexico City. "Approving Nafta on the Mexican side is a safe shot since the party controls 61 of 64 seats. It would be an embarrassment for them to pass it and then find it rejected in the United States."
President Salinas, former President George Bush and former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada signed the agreement last Dec. 17. The Canadian House of Commons approved the agreement 140-127 on May 27.
In Washington, many members of the House of Representatives still say they are undecided on how they will vote. After a House vote, the United States Senate will also have to vote.
In Mexico, there is no doubt about the outcome of a vote. But if the pact is defeated in the United States, it is expected that Mr. Salinas could then use a Senate debate to put his spin on what happened.
"You could expect to see a series of nationalistic speeches," said Denise Dresser, a political scientist at the Colegio de Mexico, "It would be a sham debate, basically designed to allow Salinas to save face and convince the nation that what happened was not a defeat, which of course it would be."
 
Speaking Their Minds
 It is not just the opposition Senators who have trouble with the trade pact. Members of Mr. Salinas's own party have voiced concerns about its impact and have recently shown a willingness to speak their own mind. Last summer observers were shocked when five Institutional Revolutionary Party members of the lower house publicly voted against a set of constitutional changes Mr. Salinas had proposed to reform the electoral process.
Five votes out of 500 did not make for a palace revolt, but in a country where the party line has long been strictly adhered to, it was enough to make people in the Government glad that the free trade pact would not have to go before the lower house.
"Controlling the lower house is not as secure as controlling the Senate," said Professor Molinar. "In the Senate the agenda is easy to control, and you can be sure they will vote for the treaty, even if they have to hold their noses while they do it."

HEADLINE: THE FREE TRADE ACCORD;
Nafta: Something to Offend Everyone

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 13

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration's biggest problem in promoting the North American Free Trade Agreement is that the seven-inch-thick pact contains something to offend almost anyone.
Truckers, vegetable growers, dolphin lovers, seamstresses, nurses and human rights activists have all been critical of the agreement for very specific reasons. The Clinton Administration's supplemental agreements on labor and environmental issues placated some environmentalists but alarmed conservative Republicans afraid that the agreement's international commissions would infringe on American sovereignty. 
 Much of the focus of public debate, however, has centered on a few broad questions: whether American jobs will be created or destroyed, whether American wages will fall and whether the Federal budget deficit will grow.
 
Simple Goal
 Heavier than many Thanksgiving turkeys, the 15-pound agreement was drafted with a simple goal: to allow goods and services to be traded freely across the length and breadth of North America. If approved by the House and Senate in the coming week, it would take effect on Jan. 1 and gradually eliminate the taxes and other restrictions that Canada, Mexico and the United States now impose on each others' goods.
Most economists say the elimination of trade barriers would eventually increase the prosperity of all three countries. It would allow each country to specialize in producing whatever it can make most efficiently, while importing the rest.
But labor groups contend that American workers will lose jobs to Mexican workers earning a fifth or less of their wages. Even American factory workers who do not lose their jobs will face demands from employers to reduce their wages or risk watching their factory equipment moved to Mexico, critics warn.
 
Debate Over Jobs
 The International Union of Electronic Workers, which represents many low-skilled assembly workers, has shrunk to 150,000 members from 360,000. Its president, William Bywater, believes that, "pretty close to 100,000 jobs" have been lost to Mexico in the last several years.
Administration officials respond by saying that most businesses will conclude that American workers are worth the extra money and that low-skill jobs have been moving overseas even without the pact. "American workers are more than five times more productive than their counterparts in Mexico, because they have better tools, they have better training, they have a better infrastructure," Vice President Al Gore said during his debate with Ross Perot on Tuesday."
To help American workers who do lose their jobs because of competition from Mexico, the Administration has inserted a $140 million job retraining program into the pact. And to prevent Mexico or Canada from gaining a commercial advantage by systematically failing to enforce labor laws, Administration trade officials spent their first six months in office negotiating a supplemental agreement establishing fines and trade sanctions for patterns of failing to enforce these laws.
 
Will Side Agreements Work?
 Labor unions have dismissed the supplemental agreement for two main reasons. The penalties only apply in cases involving minimum wages, child labor and health and safety regulations, but not industrial relations laws regarding organizing labor unions. And any penalties can only be imposed at the end of a bureaucratic process that can last several years and allows ample opportunity for two out of three nations to block action.
Mickey Kantor, the United States Trade Representative, promised last spring that the supplemental agreements would have "real teeth." But Mr. Bywater and other labor leaders are dissatisfied.
"If these teeth were in the mouth of a lion, it'd only be able to eat Pablum," he said.
While labor unions have focused on job concerns, consumer groups have been critical of the agreement on the ground of national sovereignty. The pact allows challenges to American safety regulations, they say, like the permissible level of pesticide residues on imported fruit.
The agreement allows such challenges because American exporters have suffered in the past when foreign countries have protected their industries by introducing safety rules barring production methods used mainly in the United States. For example, in the late 1980's the European Community limited imports of American beef produced with hormones that European cattle ranchers seldom use.
Administration officials have defended the rules on challenges by emphasizing that a Mexican or Canadian challenger to an American safety regulation would have to prove that there was no scientific basis to the safety standard. But consumer activists are worried about what will qualify as a scientifically based rule.
"I hope that their definitions are all right -- I don't know if they are," said Lori Wallach, the trade director for Public Citizen, a consumer group founded by Ralph Nader.
 
Odd Alliance
 Consumer and environmental groups have formed an odd, informal alliance with the travel industry and conservative Republicans in criticizing an accompanying budget for the pact and a companion program to clean up the border with Mexico. Federal law requires that as current American taxes on Mexican goods are eliminated, the lost tax revenues must be replaced with new taxes or with cuts in mandatory spending programs.
To raise the needed money, President Clinton has proposed several accounting changes, a four-year tax of $1.50 on international air and sea travelers entering the United States and the creation of a new bank that would issue bonds so as to lend money for anti-pollution and economic development programs.
Consumer advocates and environmentalists have complained that the bank is not big enough, while some Republicans have complained about the temporary tax on airline passengers.

Chart: "What's What in the Trade Pact"
 The product of more than three years of work spanning two Administrations, the NORTH AMERICAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT is a comprehensive, three-volume plan to bind together the economies of Canada, Mexico and the United States. If approved by the House and Senate during the coming week, it would take effect on Jan. 1, 1994. The pact is intended to eliminate various taxes and rules to allow goods and services to be sold freely from the Arctic to Acapulco.
President Clinton has attached a wide range of agreements and special deals to the trade pact since President Bush signed it on Dec. 17, 1992. The Clinton Administration completed supplemental agreements on labor and environmental issues and on surges of imports on Aug. 13. To win support in Congress for the agreement, the Administration has also struck several side deals with Mexico in recent weeks to address the concerns of specific industries and has proposed several new Federal programs to cope with the agreement's effects, among them a retraining program for workers who lose their jobs as a result of the agreement.
Because the United States and Canada already entered into a free-trade agreement on Jan. 1, 1989, the North American pact would mainly affect trade between Mexico and the United States and between Mexico and Canada.
Unlike the European Community, the North American free-trade zone created by the agreement would not involve common tariffs and other trade barriers toward the rest of the world. Nor would it involve a common foreign policy or efforts to combine currencies, welfare programs and immigration policies.
 
THE BASICS
What the agreement covers: Goods and services produced in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Some goods, like television sets and cars, must also be assembled partly or entirely from North American components to qualify for tariff-free treatment. The nationality of a factory's owners does not matter -- a Japanese-owned auto factory in the United States can qualify for duty-free status if it uses enough North American parts.
Tariffs: Taxes that the Federal Government collects on goods from other countries. Agreement phases out tariffs immediately or over 5, 10 or 15 years. Mexican tariffs on American goods average 10 percent.
Emergency Action: If one of the three countries finds that a surge of imports is devastating a domestic industry, it may temporarily raise tariffs on the product to pre-Nafta levels. The country raising tariffs must compensate the exporting country by lowering tariffs more quickly.
Immigration: Corporate executives and professionals would be allowed to cross borders with fewer formalities. The Clinton Administration contends the pact would also discourage illegal immigration from Mexico by creating jobs there; critics say that the pact would fuel illegal immigration by throwing thousands of Mexicans out of work in uncompetitive industries like corn farming.
Investment: No investment from another North American nation could be seized without full compensation. Investors would be guaranteed the right to convert profits into another currency and take them out of the country. A North American investor facing discriminatory treatment in another North American country could seek binding arbitration from a three-nation panel.
Consumer safety: Current inspections of imported food and other products would continue. Existing American safety standards for pesticide residues and other hazards would be subject to Mexican or Canadian challenge as unfair trade barriers if they discriminate against imports. But the challenger would have to prove that no scientific basis existed for the standard.
 
THE KEY INDUSTRIES
Agriculture: The United States and Mexico will eliminate 57 percent of their trade barriers immediately, 94 percent after 10 years and the rest over 15 years. The slowest phaseouts are for uncompetitive crops like cantaloupes grown in the United States and Mexican corn.
Automakers: Would immediately eliminate the United States' tariff of 2.5 percent on cars assembled in Mexico. Would cut the 25 percent U.S. tariff on light trucks to 10 percent and then phase this out over five years. Would immediately cut Mexico's tariffs on American-built cars and light trucks to 10 percent from 20 percent, then phase out the 10 percent tariff over 10 years for cars and over 5 years for trucks. Would eliminate over 10 years Mexico's requirement that carmakers export two cars from Mexico for each car they import.
Banks: Would dismantle Mexico's virtual ban on American banks. American banks would be allowed to take over up to 15 percent of the Mexican banking market by Jan. 1, 2000, and up to 25 percent by 2004. All limits would disappear by 2007. Mexican banks are already allowed to buy American banks.
Brokerages: American securities firms would be allowed to gradually take over up to 30 percent of the Mexican market by 2004; no limits after that.
Clothing and Textiles: eWould liminate many Mexican tariffs immediately and American and Canadian tariffs over 10 years. Garments that qualify for tariff breaks must be sewn from North American fabric that is woven from North American yarn.
Energy: Mexico would be allowed to retain its ban on foreign ownership of oil and natural gas reserves. But American drilling companies would be allowed for the first time to share in some of the profits from striking oil in Mexico.
Trucking: Mexican and American truck drivers would be allowed to drive anywhere in each other's countries by the end of the century. American companies would be allowed to acquire majority stakes in Mexican trucking companies in 2000 and own then entirely in 2003.
 
THE SIDE AGREEMENTS
North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation: Would create a special office in Canada to investigate environmental abuses anywhere in North America. Sets of a series of steps that can lead to fines on countries that do not enforce their own environmental laws. Trade sanctions of up to $20 million a year could be imposed on the United States and Mexico if they did not pay the fines.
North American Agreement on Labor Cooperation: Would create a special office in Washington that can only investigate labor abuses when two out of three countries agree. Also creates national administrative offices in each country that can do their own investigations. Fines or trade sanctions only possible if countries fail to enforce worker safety regulations, child labor laws and minimum wage standards.
 
TH DEALS BETWEEEN MEXICO AND THE UNITED STATES
Sugar. Mexico would not be allowed to export more sugar to the United States by substituting corn sweeteners for sugar in Mexican bottled drinks and processed foods.
Orange Juice. If Mexican shipments increase sharply and American juice prices stay low for five straight days, the United States would impose steep tariffs on the extra Mexican shipments.
Wine, bed frames, car window glass, household appliances: Negotiations would start on Jan. 1 to accelerate reductions of Mexican tariffs on these goods. The current agreement provides for a slow phase-out of tariffs.
 
THE MERCHANICS
Worker retraining. $90 million would be spent over the first 18 months of the agreement to retrain and financially support workers who lose their jobs because of the agreement. After 18 months, these workers would be included in a new Federal program, being designed now by the Labor Department, that would cover all displaced workers.
North American Development Bank: The American and Mexican Governments would spend $450 million to set up a bank, which would then borrow $3 billion by selling bonds. The bank would lend money to communities hurt by the pact and to environmental clean-up projects on American border with Mexico.
U.S.-Mexico Border Environmental Commission: Would spend up to $8 billion from the North American Development Bank, World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank to clean up air and water pollution and toxic waste dumps.

Bonuses for Adding Games and Losing Weight

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
Deion Sanders received the biggest bonus of the 1993 season, $1.75 million, but Julio Valera benefited from the most unusual.
Valera, a California Angels pitcher who tends to the chunky side, had a body-fat bonus in his contract and earned $7,500 from the provision. Valera's contract called for him to have his body fat measured on the first day of each of six months during the season, and each time he met the stipulated percentage, he would receive $2,500. 
 He succeeded three times, including the first testing date, May 1, when he had to have 20 percent or less body fat.
Runner-up on the unusual-bonus list is the $15,000 Stan Belinda earned. Belinda finished the season in the Kansas City Royals' bullpen but received $15,000 for having the most Rolaids reliever points for the Pittsburgh Pirates.
 
Just Being There
 Sanders, who dabbles in two sports for Atlanta teams, gained his hefty bonus for just being there. That is, his contract provided for $1.75 million to be added to his $1 million salary if he was available to render his services to the Braves through the end of the season or the post-season.
In other words, the Braves offered him that inducement to stay with them instead of moving to the Falcons for the start of the football season.
Because of the Sanders payment, the Braves paid out the second largest amount of bonuses among the 28 major league teams, $3,753,750. The Chicago White Sox were first, paying out $4,515,000, including $1.55 million to Ellis Burks for number of plate appearances and time on the roster and $1.5 million to Bo Jackson for number of games he was available to play.
Burks and Jackson were third and fourth on the bonus list. Jeff Russell of Boston was second, receiving $1,675,000 for number of games pitched and time on the Red Sox roster. Orel Hershiser of Los Angeles (games started), Eric Davis of Los Angeles and Detroit (roster time) and Jeff Reardon of Cincinnati (games pitched) each earned $1 million in bonuses.
The Montreal Expos paid out the least in bonuses: zero. The San Diego Padres were next, giving Tony Gwynn a $25,000 bonus for making the All-Star team. Hershiser was the only member of the Dodgers who got a bonus.
Several teams showed unusual generosity in giving players bonuses they had not contractually earned.
 
Bonus Without Earning It
 Alan Trammell fell three games short of reaching the fourth level of bonuses in his contract for games played, but the Tigers gave him an extra $127,500 -- $7,500 for each of 17 games he played beyond the third level.
Fernando Valenzuela of Baltimore, Edwin Nunez of Oakland and Luis Aquino of Florida each had bonus provisions based on points compiled from games pitched. Each received the bonus for the next level he didn't reach. Valenzuela and Nunez each got an extra $50,000 and Aquino got $10,000.
Then there was Pat Hentgen, who received a $25,000 bonus for making the American League All-Star team in July even though his Toronto contract included no such provision.
 
Thompson Back With Giants
 The free-agent signing season produced its first major result last night when the San Francisco Giants re-signed their second baseman, Robby Thompson, to a three-year contract for at least $12 million. Previously, three pitchers who filed for free agency had re-signed with their teams, each for one year at $800,000 -- Danny Cox with Toronto and Joe Boever and Storm Davis with Detroit.
The most attractive players are in the process of determining which teams are interested in them. Will Clark, for example, visited the Rangers in Texas last week and plans to visit the Orioles in Baltimore this week because the San Francisco Giants haven't made it worthwhile forgoing the market.
"We have respectfully disagreed about Will's market value at this stage," Jeff Moorad, Clark's agent, said. "All things being equal, Will would prefer to return to San Francisco but we will explore some other opportunities."
Although their first preference would be to re-sign their young first baseman, Rafael Palmeiro, the Rangers have interest in Clark because Palmeiro rejected a five-year, $26.5 million offer and is exploring other possibilities.
Andres Galarraga is the third first baseman available in a market that is far less glittering than last winter's. The Colorado Rockies' negotiating stance has not enticed the National League batting champion to re-sign with them.
"We have some serious disagreements," Jim Bronner, Galarraga's agent, said. "We're beginning to explore different opportunities."
Noting Galarraga's age, 33 before midseason next year, the Rockies want their .370 hitter to accept a contract averaging less than $3 million a year and calling for declining salaries each year.
The Rockies apparently have an internal oddity. They have an owner, Jerry McMorris, who has said he is prepared to spend to improve the team, but a general manager, Bob Gebhard, who is reluctant to depart from his baseball front-office upbringing in Minnesota and Montreal, where they don't like to spend. More often, it's the general manager who is eager to spend but the owner who puts economic handcuffs on him.
 
Randy Johnson Is in Demand
 If Randy Johnson were available in the trade market, general managers would be lined up three deep waiting to talk with Woody Woodward, the Seattle Mariners' general manager. The Mariners, however, are trying to sign Johnson to a four-year contract and keep him beyond next season, after which he could be a free agent.
Barry Meister, Johnson's agent, has made a counterproposal and is waiting to hear from the Mariners, who may be waiting to make their next move until Johnson returns later this week from a Tahiti honeymoon.
If the two sides cannot reach agreement, the Mariners are expected to begin talks with interested clubs, try to make a trade, then give the lucky team a chance to reach agreement with the pitcher before making the deal final.
Johnson, a 30-year-old left-hander, gave notice this year that he is about to become one of the most dominant pitchers in either league. He led the majors in strikeouts (308), strikeouts per nine innings (10.86), batting average against (.203) and hits per nine innings (6.52).
His strikeout ratio was the fourth best ever, and his 112-strikeout lead over Mark Langston of California was the fifth biggest ever.
 
Tartabull's Problems Grow
 As for high-priced players, the Yankees wouldn't mind trading Danny Tartabull. At least some members of the club hierarchy believe the offense he can produce isn't worth the aggravation they feel he has created.
The Yankees are incensed that Tartabull, whose shoulder injury made him solely a designated hitter for most of the past season, postponed surgery on the shoulder, had cosmetic surgery, then went off to Europe on vacation.
Dennis Gilbert, the agent who two years ago induced the Yankees to give his client a five-year, $25.5 million contract, said much has been made about nothing. He refused to discuss the cosmetic surgery or even confirm that Tartabull had it -- "That's personal and nobody's business," he said -- but he said the Tartabulls had planned, and paid for, the European trip long ago.
"It's my understanding that Dr. Jobe said his rehabilitation time would be about a month," Gilbert said, referring to Dr. Frank Jobe, the Los Angeles orthopedist who will do the operation. "Danny had plans since April to take a vacation. If it was something that would jeopardize Danny's playing the outfield during the season, Danny would've canceled or delayed his trip. But I think Dr. Jobe will shed some light on this thing."
Dr. Jobe, however, was not available to do any shedding. A secretary in his office said he was in Hawaii and she did not know where he could be reached.
Gilbert said Tartabull would be back in "a couple of weeks" and planned to have the surgery as soon as he's back.
"It's just a little scope to make a minor repair," the agent said. "It's not like they have to do any major reconstructive surgery. He'll have December, January and February to be 100 percent and even March. The season doesn't start until April. Danny expects to be the opening-day right fielder for the New York Yankees."
Unless the Yankees sign Rafael Palmeiro and trade Tartabull. Would they trade him? "We'd trade anybody just about to help our ball club," General Manager Gene Michael said.
The Kansas City Royals have been mentioned as being desirous of getting Tartabull back, but Herk Robinson, their general manager, said a trade was highly unlikely.
"Hal McRae has always liked Danny," Robinson said of the Royals' manager, "but we have to take a close look at our priorities. We'd be filling one hole, but we'd be creating others. I don't see that. We'd like a big bat, but I don't see how that would be feasible."

HEADLINE: Nov. 7-13: Disney Loses $900 Million;
More Trouble at France's Magic Kingdom

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

 BODY:
Euro Disney, a victim of Europe's lingering recession and the hubris of its Californian parent, reported a staggering $900 million loss for its first full fiscal year, sending its stock into a nose dive and raising the possibility that Mickey's stay in Europe may be singularly brief.
In effect, the 18-month-old theme park, which opened amid endless hoopla and occasional grumblings about a "cultural Chernobyl," is now in need of rescue from Walt Disney. Without a substantial injection of new capital -- analysts reckon something close to $2 billion -- Euro Disney will buckle under about $3.5 billion of debt and the cost of running a resort that is still well short of paying its way. 
 For now, Walt Disney has promised to pump in money. But despite increasingly radical attempts to slash costs and accommodate European tastes (alcohol is now served in the theme park), the resort still looks oversized and under-frequented as gray drizzle and recession settle over the Paris suburb of Marne-la-Vallee for another long winter.

HEADLINE: Nafta's True Importance

 BODY:
There's more at stake than a simple trade pact when the House votes on the North American Free Trade Agreement this Wednesday. For President Clinton, the vote will test his, and the Democratic Party's, ability to shape major legislation. For the U.S., the vote will test its longstanding commitment to open trade -- the primary locomotive of world growth for a half-century.
Republican and Democratic Administrations alike have urged Latin and South Americans to adopt market reforms and open their borders to U.S. exports. If the U.S. now rejects Nafta because it fears competition from an economy one-twentieth its size, it will look like the hemisphere's biggest hypocrite. 
 The treaty would gradually phase out tariffs between Canada, Mexico and the U.S., creating a large open regional market, and would provide tight legal protection to foreign investors. The Administration says Nafta will produce an economic renaissance; critics say Nafta will destroy jobs, cut wages and damage the environment. The truth is, by comparison, prosaic.
Will Nafta create or destroy jobs? Neither. Trade affects where in the U.S. people work, but not how many people work. Under Nafta, Mexico will export more clothes, vegetables and brooms to the U.S. And the U.S. will export more automobiles, computers and computer software to Mexico.
Employment will rise in some industries and fall in others but is likely to change little over all. That is because it depends less on trade than on the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve Board. If, contrary to predictions, Nafta leads to a flood of Mexican imports, and higher unemployment, the Fed can pump more money into the economy and push employment toward its original level.
Will Nafta suck American industry south of the border to take advantage of low Mexican wages? Critics raise the specter of U.S. firms closing factories and fleeing to Mexico. Some companies will relocate, but the numbers won't be large. Mexico might attract about $15 billion in extra investment. But that's a small fraction of the $500 billion invested in plant and equipment every year in the U.S.
Mexican wages are low because the Mexican economy isn't very productive. They are not a huge draw for U.S. companies and Nafta does not make producing in Mexico any cheaper.
Are Mexicans too poor to buy U.S. goods? Ross Perot's demeaning sound bite is belied by the facts. Mexico is the third-largest buyer of U.S. exports and currently buys more goods from the U.S. than the U.S. buys from it. Nafta would lower Mexican tariffs by a lot and U.S. tariffs, because they are already low, only a little. That means the price of U.S. goods in Mexico will fall enough to make U.S. exports more affordable to Mexicans.
Will wages of low-paid workers rise or fall? Many U.S. workers fear their wages (after accounting for inflation) will fall because they have done so for the better part of two decades. But the anguish is misdirected. Trade explains only a tiny part of the trend and Nafta won't make matters any worse.
Some U.S. companies will cut back employment as they relocate; and some Mexican exports to the U.S. will increase. On both scores, U.S. employers will cut wages to stay competitive. But this is only half the story. Nafta will raise U.S. exports, and the U.S. industries that are likely to expand hire about as many low-paid workers as the U.S. industries that are expected to shrink. Nafta's impact on wages will be negligible.
Will Nafta harm the environment? Most major environmental groups in the U.S. support Nafta. And for good reason. It explicitly protects U.S. environmental regulations and builds in a mechanism for sanctions if Mexico fails to enforce its own environmental laws, which are already strict. Critics charge that the agreement would invite U.S. companies to flee south to evade tough U.S. enforcement; but few U.S. companies spend as much as 1 percent of costs on compliance -- which is too small an expense to justify relocating in Mexico.
The case against Nafta isn't sound. But proponents should not dismiss the pain of those Americans -- probably a few hundred thousand over a decade -- who will be laid off. That amount of fluctuation happens month by month in a 120 million-member labor force. But to the victims, the problem is severe. The answer isn't to throw the entire economy into a protectionist straitjacket, but to provide ample retraining and education.
After weighing the economic pros and cons, Nafta comes out slightly ahead. But the other stakes -- the vitality of the Clinton Presidency and the future shape of the U.S. relationship with Mexico and the rest of Latin and South America -- loom even more important. They are the reasons that Democrats, in the party of Bill Clinton, and Republicans, in the historic party of free trade, ought to vote yes.

HEADLINE: In America;
The Real Mexico

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico has opened up markets and improved conditions for big business, both foreign and domestic, but he has done it by keeping the heavy boot of repression on the throat of Mexican workers.
A magazine ad sponsored by the state of Yucatan earlier this year showed an American businessman complaining, "There is no way I can get my labor costs down to $1 an hour." The ad copy below the photo extolled the availability of cheap Mexican labor and concluded, "Yes you can, in Yucatan." 
 The ad was eventually yanked because Mexican officials feared it would hurt the chances for approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The American workplace is a paradise compared with Mexico's. The average hourly compensation, including benefits, for a production-line worker in the United States in 1992 was $16.17; in Mexico, it was $2.35. The minimum wage in the U.S. is $4.25 an hour. In Mexico, it is $4.60 a day.
A Green Giant plant that left 200 American workers jobless when it moved from Watsonville, Calif., to Irapuato, Mexico, in the early-1980's was able to cut the wages it paid to vegetable trimmers from $7.58 an hour to 83 cents an hour.
These are some of the reasons why workers in the United States are afraid that big companies will continue taking their jobs south, and that Nafta will accelerate the trend.
The plight of Mexican workers is grim. They don't have much in the way of rights by American standards and President Salinas is committed to keeping it that way. His overall economic strategy is to move away from protectionism, opening Mexico up for foreign investment. There is no better way to attract investment than to insure that labor costs remain low.
Mexican labor unions are tightly controlled. They have to apply to the Government for permission to strike. There were more than 7,000 applications to the federal Government in 1991, according to Harley Shaiken, a labor expert from the University of California at Berkeley who has studied the Mexican economy. Only 136 of them were approved.
There is only the tiniest chance that a truly independent union will even be recognized by the Government. A dispute has arisen over how many have been recognized in the past decade or so. Said Mr. Shaiken: "Some say it's been one. Those that use a broader definition say it's been two."
But Mexico is not just a country that deliberately sacrifices the well-being of its workers in the name of economic development. It's also a land of torture and extreme poverty.
Several respected human rights organizations, including Amnesty International and the United Nations Committee Against Torture, have complained about the extensive use of torture by federal and state police officials in Mexico, and the failure of the Government to make substantial efforts to stop it.
Carlos Salinas (no relation to the President) is an official with Amnesty International. In testimony before a U.S. Congressional subcommittee last month, he said, "Mexican violators are not accountable and they are brazen."
He told the committee "they beat and kick their victims"; they "introduce carbonated water with chili pepper up the victim's nose"; they "semi-asphyxiate" them by putting plastic bags over their heads or submerging their heads in water; they shock them with electric prods or leave them hanging by their wrists for long periods of time.
President Salinas, mindful of the negative impact that human rights abuses could have on Nafta, has instituted reforms, but there is little real enforcement. The torture, according to Amnesty International and the other organizations, continues.
It is estimated that more than half of the 82 million Mexicans live in poverty, and 18 million in "extreme poverty." Amid these conditions a million new workers enter the job market each year and two-thirds cannot find full-time employment.
It will be a long time before we see tremendous purchasing power in Mexico. What we have now is an enormous sponge ready to soak up the low-paying jobs offered by large corporations answering President Salinas's call to invest in Mexico.

HEADLINE: Trade Debate Rubs Salt in Canada's Wounds

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I am a Canadian who experienced strong flashback feelings after listening to the Nov. 9 debate on the North American Free Trade Agreement between Al Gore and Ross Perot. Vice President Gore's comments took me back to 1988, when Canada adopted a Free Trade Agreement with the United States. Many of his comments could have been scripted by the Progressive Conservatives, the party that brought free trade to Canada. 
 We were told that free trade would improve the Canadian economy by making it more competitive.
We were told that free-trade would create, not eliminate, jobs.
We were told that not to vote for free trade would mean succumbing to a politics of fear. Anti-free trade sentiments were thus just a manifestation of some inferiority complex.
Finally, we were told this was a historic moment and that if we didn't take advantage of it by moving into the future with confidence, we would lose out on a one-time opportunity.
Well, free trade has indeed been a historic moment for Canada. Since 1988 we've lost more than 500,000 manufacturing jobs. Unemployment levels remain disturbingly high (approximately 11 percent nationally). Still mired in an economic recession, Canadians are looking at an alarming erosion of our social system -- especially in medical care, education and the environment.
Five years later, we're still waiting for the free trade miracle in Canada.
Incidentally, we had another historic moment north of the 49th parallel. The Progressive Conservatives were given the boot by Canadians last month -- dropping from more than 150 seats in Parliament to a mere 2. A free-trade-related vote? Who can say for sure? But Bill Clinton and Al Gore might do well to take note of this history.

HEADLINE: Trade Debate Rubs Salt in Canada's Wounds;
Neither of the Above

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I wish there had been a third debater on the Larry King program on Nov. 9, along with Vice President Gore and Ross Perot. Perhaps then, instead of a mass media event, we could have witnessed a constructive discussion focusing on some of the real issues of international trade:
* The debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement is not a clash between "free trade" and "protectionism." Neither of these code terms accurately describes the accord or the positions of most of those who oppose it. These terms just make it harder for people to focus on the agreement's actual provisions and their likely effects.
* Before the North American Free Trade Agreement was negotiated, and whether or not it passes, the strategy of transnational business has been, and will continue to be, to move operations to lower-cost sites. The issue is whether or not we will change our trade policy to discourage that strategy.
* When the European Community countries formed their trading bloc, they made agreements that will raise the wages and standards of the countries at the low end of the scale.
* There is significant opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement in Mexico (as I learned when I studied there this year) from independent unions, small farmers and community groups. They fear the trade agreement will bring more exploitation of low-paid Mexican workers; increased unemployment of some of the higher-paid workers employed by Mexican companies that cannot compete with higher-tech companies based in the United States; radical changes to the traditional culture of Mexico, and benefits for a very small number of upper- and middle-class Mexicans.
* If this version of the North American Free Trade Agreement is defeated (and I think it should be defeated), trade with Mexico and Latin America will continue.
The real issue, as I see it, is whether or not the people of the United States, Mexico and Canada will demand a trade policy that promotes real development of the Mexican economy and that sets and enforces decent standards of living for workers in North America and throughout the world.

HEADLINE: Trade Debate Rubs Salt in Canada's Wounds;
The European Example

 BODY:
To the Editor:
When Vice President Gore asked Ross Perot what Mr. Perot specifically would change in the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mr. Perot responded that he would study other free trade agreements. He indicated that he thinks the United States could learn from the experience of the European Community in integrating Spain and Portugal. 
 If Mr. Perot studied the case of Spain and Portugal, he would see that not only does it not present a good example for the United States, but also he would strongly oppose any attempt to treat Mexico as the E.C. has treated Spain and Portugal.
The European Community does not have a mere free-trade treaty with Spain and Portugal. These countries have been fully integrated into the E.C. social, economic, legislative and political structure. Behind their rapid economic progress are tremendous European Community subsidies and developmental aid.
Europeans pay dearly for this at tax time and with outrageous prices for agricultural produce to subsidize farmers in developing parts of the European Community.
Before Spain and Portugal were integrated, the Community had a simpler free-trade agreement with them, as it now has with some North African countries, Turkey and Israel. These agreements are motivated by foreign policy, security concerns and a desire to give economic aid, and are disadvantageous to the E.C. in economic terms. None of these agreements are between the E.C. and one of its top five trading partners. And none are as comprehensive as the North American Free Trade Agreement and its side agreements.
Mr. Perot would spend his entire fortune to oppose any European Community-style foreign aid subsidy for Mexico.

HEADLINE: M.B.A. Programs Fight for Shrinking Pool of Students Interested in Business

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
For years, business schools have taught students the importance of knowing their markets and their products. But now business schools across the country are finding that they must heed their own message.
In the last few years, interest in business careers and business education has slid. "We're all like the airlines after deregulation, suddenly faced with really having to compete," said Stephen Christakos, director of admissions at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. 
 And competing they are. Even the Harvard Business School, though it has not experienced a decline, is scrapping its old ways of training future executives. Under a proposed new curriculum disclosed earlier this week, Harvard business administration students would focus less on specific disciplines and more on combining skills to solve problems.
"We're not just competing with other schools," said James I. Cash, chairman of the Harvard M.B.A. program. "We're competing with other professions."
 
More Rounded Curriculum
 Many business schools are setting up special programs in international business, information technology or other high-profile subjects. Many, too, are increasing liberal arts courses in their M.B.A. programs while they play down the number-crunching ones. And some are offering study abroad and courses on foreign languages and cultures.
The Haas School of Business at the University of California at Berkeley has replaced a basic accounting course with a broader one that covers how businesses are set up and governed, how they manage people, how they market their services and how they compete internationally. Next year the school will begin offering a special certificate to students who take a certain number of foreign language and culture courses.
Under Harvard's proposed program, first-year M.B.A. students would take more general courses like "Managing Products and Services" and "Leading People and Organizations" instead of specific courses like marketing and operations. And the school said students would often work together in teams to solve business problems.
The Harvard program, which must be approved by the faculty, was the result of more than a year of internal review. The business school hopes to have most of the program in operation by the fall of 1995.
In past recessions, business school applications rose, but the recession of the 90's produced the reverse. "People no longer feel that loyalty and productivity and, yes, a business degree are keys to success," said Ronald J. Patten, dean of DePaul University's College of Commerce in Chicago.
The average starting salary offered in 1993 to a graduate of a business school without a technical undergraduate degree was $36,513. For those with technical undergraduate degrees -- say, engineering or computer science -- the salaries offered averaged $40,980.
Another factor fueling the decline in M.B.A. applicants is that the definition of "success" has changed for many students, said Charles W. Hickman, director of projects and services at the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business, which accredits business schools.
"Today's students view contributing to society and improving lives of other people as more important than high financial reward," he said. "Many are choosing professions other than business."
Indeed, numerous surveys show that the number of undergraduates planning to major in business has dropped by a third since 1987.
 
Apathy About Business Careers
 Among women, the group that drove up the enrollment figures of business schools in the 80's, the drop has been even steeper. In 1987, 20 percent of first-year female undergraduates wanted to major in business; in 1992, only 12 percent did. "The business schools have been blindsided," said Dr. Kenneth C. Green, director of the Center for Scholarly Technology at the University of Southern California.
Undergraduate apathy toward a business career has already shown up in the number of people taking the Graduate Management Admissions Test, which most graduate business schools require applicants to take. In the last two years the number of applicants taking the test has dropped nearly 18 percent.
This year, the Graduate School of Business at Stanford University has seen a 20 percent decrease in applications. The Wharton School's highly selective joint degree program with the Joseph H. Lauder Institute, its international cousin at the University of Pennsylvania campus, received only 310 applications for its 55 spots this year, down from 325 the previous year.
Elsewhere, the Amos Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College received 2,077 applications this year, as against 2,663 in 1990. Even the Kellogg School, which has ranked No. 1 the last three times in Business Week's biannual business school survey, has seen its applications drop to 4,328 in 1993 from 5,016 in 1991.
 
New Emphasis on Teaching
 As many business schools focus on overhauling and broadening their curriculums, many have begun to pay attention to professors' teaching skills, a radical change for academia, where published research is often the only route to tenure and promotion.
"At Iowa, we turned down a would-be professor with excellent research credentials because we heard his teaching abilities were not great," said George Daly, former dean of the College of Business Administration at the University of Iowa. In August, Mr. Daly took over as dean of the Leonard N. Stern School of Business at New York University, which is now emphasizing teaching skills as much as research in its tenure decisions.
Perhaps most unusual is that business schools are now marketing their new offerings as aggressively as Campbell markets soup. The schools are putting together brochures that tout their resources, placement records and new curriculums.
The schools are also easing the application process, allowing students to pay fees by credit card and to apply electronically via computer modem. They are holding receptions for foreign applicants in Tokyo, Frankfurt, London and other foreign cities. And, increasingly, deans themselves are being sent to woo potential students.
 
Holding the Line
 In addition to Harvard, business schools that have not seen decreases include Babson College in Wellesley, Mass., and the business schools at Columbia University and the University of Illinois. But these schools are working doubly hard to make sure their enrollment figures remain solid. Babson, for example, has hired a full-time director of marketing and has put Howard Rubenstein, a New York public relations expert, on retainer.
Having to seek out students is a new and bitter pill for business schools, which had grown accustomed to growth. In 1972, only 12 percent of master's degrees were awarded in business; by 1990 that number had risen to 24 percent, although it dropped slightly, to 23.3 percent a year later. In 1972, only 4 percent of M.B.A.'s were granted to women; by 1991, the proportion had grown to 35 percent. In 1974 there were 389 M.B.A. programs in the nation; now there are nearly 800.
 
Shifting Student Demographics
 Today's college-age students are a much smaller group than the baby boomers were, and more of them are members of minorities. By 2000, educators says, 28 percent of college-age men and women will be black or Hispanic; at present those groups comprise only 8 percent of M.B.A. enrollments.
In another tactic to combat the decline, many schools are trying to attract students early. The Tuck school at Dartmouth is encouraging students to apply directly from college, rather than wait until they have had a few years' business experience, a break with business school tradition.
And the University of Richmond's undergraduate School of Business, which previously did not allow liberal arts undergraduates to apply to the business program until their junior year, now offers first-year undergraduates who scored 1,200 on the Scholastic Assessment Tests a guarantee: provided they maintain a 2.8 grade point average, they will automatically be accepted in the business school in their junior year.
"We used to need a moat with alligators around us to keep the students away," said R. Clifton Poole, the Richmond business school's dean. "Now we're having to form bonds with them as soon as possible."

HEADLINE: Building's New Look Shaped by Old Zoning

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
ZONING calculations with a skin strapped on." That is Richard S. Hayden's description of the architecture at 320 Park Avenue, an obsolete 32-year-old office tower that he and his colleagues are redesigning from the bones out as the new headquarters of the Mutual of America Life Insurance Company.
 Mutual bought the 34-story structure from the ailing Olympia & York last year for $130 million and is spending $73 million to reconstruct it. Since 320 Park Avenue was constructed just months ahead of the 1961 Zoning Resolution, it has about one and a half times as much floor space as would be allowed in a new building on the same site, making it well worth an owner's while to rebuild it rather than replace it. Mutual plans to occupy 10 floors and lease the rest when the building reopens in the spring of 1995. 
In the redesign by Swanke Hayden Connell Architects, the most obvious change to the flat-topped tower between 50th and 51st Streets will be the addition of a 52-foot-high gabled peak, which is to cover the rooftop mechanical equipment.
 But the building will change in other significant ways. Floor space will be carved out of the second floor, to create a more voluminous lobby, and shaved off five mid-rise floors. At the same time, floor space will be added to 10 high-rise floors, where Mutual expects to command the highest rents from its tenants. The mechanical core of the building will be expanded to put more air-distribution rooms on each floor. That, in turn, will permit overhead air ducts to be smaller, meaning that ceilings can be higher.
 Low ceilings are only one of the shortcomings at 320 Park Avenue, which was the ITT Corporation World Headquarters before that company moved out in 1990. The structure is also full of asbestos, as a building of its era would be. And its design -- glass-and-aluminum shoeboxes stacked atop one another -- owes more to the dictates of the Zoning Resolution than to architectural impulse.
 BUT zoning also works in its favor. Ungainly though it may be, 320 Park Avenue has 626,000 square feet of space. Under current zoning, a new building on the same lot could have about 441,000 square feet. In other words, Mutual effectively gets 185,000 square feet more than it would were it to start from scratch.
 Mutual of America is moving only four blocks from its current headquarters, 666 Fifth Avenue, between 52d and 53d Streets, but the journey took almost a decade.
 "The economics were such that we felt we had to leave New York City eight or nine years ago," said William J. Flynn, Mutual's chairman and chief executive officer.
 Westchester County was first to be explored but the stumbling block was the Throgs Neck Bridge, Mr. Flynn said, since so many Mutual employees live in Brooklyn or Queens or on Long Island.
 Long Island came next. Six sites were seriously examined, in Huntington and Garden City, among other places, but all fell through for a variety of reasons.
 By then it was 1990. And, Mr. Flynn said, "Everything had changed so radically that we came back to looking at New York." Among buildings under consideration was 60 Broad Street, at Beaver Street, the former Drexel Burnham Lambert headquarters.
 In the course of this search, Mutual's advisers at Kidder, Peabody & Company came across 320 Park Avenue, which fit several key criteria: it was for sale (Mutual no longer wanted to pay commercial rent tax as someone else's tenant), it offered 250,000 square feet of contiguous space for Mutual (which is now scattered through 666 Fifth Avenue), it was in the right part of mid-Manhattan (between the Avenue of the Americas and Lexington Avenue) and it was not too large.
 "It could be no greater than 750,000 square feet," said Manfred Altstadt, senior executive vice president and chief financial officer. "We didn't want to take too much in the way of rental risk."
 Several other factors influenced Mutual's decision to buy the building. One was the passage only days earlier of a bill that froze real estate assessments for eight years on office towers south of 96th Street that underwent modernization.
 "The decision to do this was based on economics," Mr. Flynn said, "rather than wanting a fancy house on Park Avenue."
 "In many ways, we're a quiet company," said Thomas J. Moran, the president and chief operating officer. "When we moved from Park Avenue South to 666 Fifth Avenue, it was to enhance our recognition. Moving to Park Avenue, as an owner, is another step in that direction."
 Mutual's headquarters were at 360 Park Avenue South, at 26th Street, until 1976, when it moved into one 62,000-square-foot floor at 666 Fifth Avenue. "To get the kind of people you wanted," Mr. Flynn recalled, "you had to be in a better neighborhood."
 Since then, Mutual has grown into 175,000 square feet of space at No. 666, occupying the 4th, 10th, 11th and 19th floors. When its original 15-year lease expired in 1991, Mutual negotiated five one-year extensions, to preserve its flexibility in moving.
 Although the company is not expanding -- it has 750 employees -- it will occupy much more space in 320 Park Avenue than it does at 666 Fifth Avenue, taking 275,000 square feet. Individual work areas are being enlarged, as is the cafeteria, and training and conference rooms are being added.
 Asbestos is now being removed from the building. That work is to be finished in February. In the next two months, removal of the existing curtain wall is scheduled to begin.
 Mutual is to occupy floors 2, 6 through 12, 34 and 35. Other floors are to be leased. (The floor count will change to 35, since Mutual is eliminating the designation of 13 -- "Superstition," Mr. Altstadt explained.)
 The reconstruction of 320 Park Avenue was already in the works when Mutual bought the building. In 1990, with the impending departure of ITT, Olympia & York Companies (U.S.A.) planned a $130 million rebuilding, to designs by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. Every floor would have been altered under this approach, with floor area taken off the bottom and added to the top. And the entire facade would have been clad in stone, Mr. Altstadt said, which would have required reinforcement for the steel frame.
 "WE did look hard at the S.O.M. plan," Mr. Altstadt said. "But the one thing that caused us to pause was the dollar amount. If we had to spend $130 million for the core and shell, the economics would have changed radically. We would have had to charge rents of $70 a square foot to make it economically viable." (Asking rents on Park Avenue are now about $40 a square foot a year, according to the Edward S. Gordon Company.)
 "From the beginning," said Mr. Hayden, the architect, "our goal was to take this building that was designed by zoning and start to see how we could create something that was driven by sculpture and design -- and keep it at a responsible budget level."
 "When you walk by that building," said Mr. Moran, Mutual's president, "we want you to have a sense of who we are. It will have a clean, sharp, modern look to it -- yet conservative -- which is how we see ourselves."
 The architects limited the use of stone to the lower 11 floors, where it would be seen by pedestrians. After the first setback, above the 12th floor, the cladding would change to painted aluminum panels. The vertical piers that separate the window bays would be capped by stainless steel moldings.
 "We felt that developing a striking and sophisticated lightweight facade was a better use of money than throwing more money into the structure," Mr. Hayden said.
 The architects made models in two different palettes, one predominantly gray and the other predominantly brown, echoing St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church and the former General Electric Building, both of which are directly across Park Avenue.
 A granite known as Sardinian gray was chosen, even though its color would seem to be at odds with the landmark church. "There are lots of ways of relating that aren't mimicking," Mr. Hayden said. "If you look at St. Bart's in detail, it's got quite a lot of gray stone to it. Although brick is the dominant tone, there's a large amount of limestone in the gray direction and marbles and tiles in a number of colors."
 Moreover, Mr. Moran said, "Browns and reds have been overused in the city."
 Inside, a number of significant changes are to be made. While floor area is reduced on five mid-rise floors, it will be increased in 10 high-rise tower floors. "We're adding space in what we call the high-rent district," Mr. Altstadt said. Those tower floors, which now have 8,000 square feet, will grow to more than 12,000 square feet.
 Another major alteration involves the mechanical core. "We've broken down the supply of air, which is the biggest consumer of space above the ceiling," said Altan O. Gursel, an associate principal at Swanke Hayden Connell. "The air-handling system has been broken down into two or three distribution points rather than one mechanical room on the floor with large ducts coming out."
 By the curious mathematics of zoning, 320 Park Avenue will grow smaller on paper even as it grows larger physically.
 THE building now has 626,000 square feet of gross floor area above ground. Mechanical space, however, is not counted against the floor area that is allowed by zoning. In the existing layout, 49,000 square feet of space is deducted, leaving a building of 577,000 square feet for zoning purposes.
 After reconstruction, there will be an increase in the gross area, to 656,000 square feet. But because the mechanical areas are growing so considerably, the deduction rises to 87,000 square feet. That yields a building of 569,000 square feet for zoning purposes.
 "We went to the limit of what we could put in without any variances being necessary or required," Mr. Moran said.
 On the mid-Manhattan skyline, the most notable facet of the reconstruction will be a gabled peak that is to be illuminated at night.
 "Since this tower is only 35 floors," Mr. Gursel said, "and we had to renovate the mechanical systems on top of the building, we thought that Mutual, as a newcomer on Park Avenue, would like to be recognized."
 Different treatments were studied. There was, for example, a more flattened top with openings cut into it. Mr. Moran likened this to a "sniper's nest." There was a more pinnacle-like top. This, too, was rejected. "It went too far," Mr. Gursel said. "It was as if we were building another church across the street, only it was so tall. It became too powerful, too much of a spire. It looks like we're racing to catch the eye first."
 "One thing we agreed on quickly," Mr. Altstadt said, "is we have to be careful not to do anything that would give the appearance of trying to compete with the church."
 But Mutual did seek a distinctive profile. After all, Mr. Moran said, "when you think about the skyline, there are few of us who wouldn't want to be a part of it."

HEADLINE: THEATER;
'Animal Crackers,' Marx Fun Once More

BYLINE: By ALVIN KLEIN

DATELINE: MILLBURN

 BODY:
NOW that the Paper Mill Playhouse's first musical of the season, "Paper Moon," misguidedly or perhaps just prematurely announced as Broadway bound, isn't, how about "Animal Crackers?" It's raring to go.
The 1928 Marx Brothers musical, the comic anarchists' third and last Broadway show (after "I'll Say She Is" and "The Cocoanuts"), represents the Paper Mill at its freest, with everything going sublimely, ridiculously right, under the light and flowing direction of Charles Repole, who staged the musical's terrific revival at the Goodspeed Opera House in Connecticut last year. 
 The demonic threesome who created a blissful commotion at Goodspeed are gracefully reunited here. Consider Frank Ferrante, the leering Capt. Jeffrey T. Spalding, "the noted African explorer," Groucho's most celebrated creation. "What? From Africa to here, $1.85?" he protests as he is hoisted on a litter by a pair of Africans in a most anticipated entrance.
Next on is Robert Michael Baker (Chico) as Signor Emanuel Ravelli, a musician who explains, in perfect nonsense, his unaffordable rates for not playing and for not rehearsing.
Les Marsden (Harpo) follows as the silent Professor of whatever it is he professes to be.
It is Zeppo, soon to disappear from the brothers' act, the "fourth of the Three Musketeers," as one song goes, who introduces the lunatic three to the terminally social Mrs. Rittenhouse's Long Island manse, smashingly designed by Michael Anania. Mrs. Rittenhouse is throwing a soiree to welcome Spalding and to unveil a pricey, world-famous oil painting, "The Hunt," which was donated by Roscoe W. Chandler, the philanthropist, who is really a Czech fish peddler, Abie Cabibble.
Before long, there are three such paintings, counting the original, floating about in and out of the frame, being folded and unfolded in and out of the Professor's baggy pockets.
Add such duplicitous characters as a pair of wicked sisters; Hives, the head butler with a swindler's past, and a couple of "making whoopie" subplots. One involves Arabella, the daughter of Mrs. Rittenhouse, a debutante, and Wally Winston, "a tabloid dirt disher."
That gives Bert Kalmar's and Harry Ruby's score more added evergreens than it had at Goodspeed. Count "I Wanna Be Loved by You" and "Nevertheless" to augment "Three Little Words," the most popular of the previous additions to the original score's five songs.
From the zesty overture, conducted by Keith Thompson, replete with Harpo's tooting taxi horn, the Paper Mill production is musically delicious. The score's grab bag is capped by "Hello, I Must Be Going," with its mock Gilbert and Sullivan choral responses, and "Hooray for Captain Spalding," which became Groucho's signature song on the television quiz show "You Bet Your Life." Mr. Marsden's second-act lyric harp solo provides a sweet interlude, and somewhere there's even a sendup of Eugene O'Neill's "Strange Interlude."
In a perfectly giddy supporting cast, John Hoshko has Zeppo's part -- Jamison, Spalding's secretary -- and Carol Swarbrick acts the ineffable Margaret Dumont role, Mrs. Rittenhouse, with skillful comic restraint.
Michael Lichtefeld's sparkling choreography, which is, throughout, intrinsic to the delirious goings-on, erupts at times in mid-dialogue. In what must be a major release after creating the dances for the dour "Secret Garden," Mr. Lichtefeld has also come up with snappy, elaborate production numbers, show stoppers all.
Restorations to George S. Kaufman's and Morrie Ryskind's original script and selections from the 1930 film adaptation, which was mostly nonmusical, include one classic Marx Brothers non sequitur and routine after another. Try to figure out Spalding's invertedly logical theory on the economic viability of the seven-cent nickel. Or the Professor's card-sharking caper.
Altogether, the new stage "Animal Crackers" is more tightly structured than the screen version. In its irresistibly wacky way, it winds down to a bittersweet ending that has the Professor flattening the whole company and himself with Flit spray, and they all fall down. It's a real knockout. Literally.
"Animal Crackers," produced by the Paper Mill Playhouse, Brookside Drive, Millburn. Performances through Dec. 12: Wednesday through Sunday at 8 P.M., Thursday at 2 P.M. and Saturday and Sunday at 3 P.M. Box office: (201) 376-4343.

HEADLINE: Front-Porch Seat on Backyard History

BYLINE: By KATE STONE LOMBARDI

DATELINE: PURCHASE

 BODY:
HERE is a little-known cemetery on the grounds of the State University of New York here. A Revolutionary War hero, Col. Thomas Thomas, was buried there in 1824, and for the few who had taken note of the site, this seemed to be its chief historical significance. But to Dr. Lisa Keller, director of SUNY Purchase's College of Letters and Science's new Institute for Westchester and Local History, the small burial ground can provide far richer historical insights.
The land used to be part of the Thomas family estate, Dr. Keller said, and in a break from common custom, the family requested that their slaves be buried alongside them instead of in a separate plot. The cemetery is one of the few integrated burial grounds in the county from that era. 
 In Dr. Keller's view, this is another example of how local history -- in this case, quite literally the history of the college's own backyard -- can provide a paradigm for understanding major themes in the country's history.
"Why were the Thomas slaves put there?" Dr. Keller asked. "Why did they break from the tradition of the times? Burial customs touch to the heart of many things. When students pursue this, they will get a whole examination of America's race relations, land-pattern uses, as well as social and economic relations."
 
An 'Arranged Marriage'
 In keeping with the goals of the institute, which was established last month, the research on the cemetery will connect the academic world with the community. Students will visit historical societies in Rye and Harrison to search for letters, diaries, deeds and other documents of the Thomas family. But the institute's mission also reflects a growing academic trend among historians -- a resurgence of interest in the significance of local history.
"This is an arranged marriage that should have been made years ago," Dr. Alfred N. Hunt, dean of the College of Letters and Science said. "This is a very historically rich community, and it needs a lot of resource help. We have students who have the resources but need something to work with. For them, it's so much better than just reading books on history. At the same time, we are creating guardians of the public trust. There are two winners here." He was referring to documents being preserved and the undergraduate students who will work on them.
In addition to an internship program for academic credit, the institute will offer courses on historical and research training and in the use and organization of archives and manuscript collections. Public events like lectures and academic symposiums will also be held for the college community and the general public.
 
The Age Before Divorce
 As part of the institute's research program, a large-scale scholarly investigation of the County Archives in Elmsford will also be a priority. Dr. Keller describes the resources there as both "extraordinary" and underappreciated.
"I was stunned when I first went there," Dr. Keller said. "I've worked in public records offices in London, small libraries in Athens. I've seen all kinds of places, and when I got to this place I couldn't believe it. Not only did they have the best organization and the best physical plant I'd ever seen but they also had phenomenal documents and lots of them."
Dr. Keller said that at the County Archives she read deed books from 1686 as well as records from the same period of couples who, in the age before divorce, simply went before a public official and declared their marriage to be over.
"They would say, 'So and so has decided he no longer gets on with his wife and they are going their separate ways,' " Dr. Keller said. "These are documents from 1685, 1687, and they are very hard to read. This stuff was literally moldering away in basements, and the archivists have gone to great lengths to literally put the pieces together and bond the old parchment onto rice paper. This is an extraordinary resource."
Dr. Keller stressed that students would have extensive training before being allowed to handle documents that were hundreds of years old. But she also reiterated the importance of records that chronicled the changing experiences of everyday life and its implications for understanding the county's history beyond battle dates and war heroes.
"For instance, little has been done about the role of ethnic migrations into Westchester," she said. "You can't talk about the development of ethnic and cultural trends in the nation without looking at a neighborhood study of how, in fact, this changed from an Irish to a black neighborhood or a working-class rural neighborhood to an urban one."
 
Forget the Kings and Queens
 Once the purview of genealogists and town archivists, local history was long viewed in academic circles as among the least consequential sources of research material. But today, many historians are mining land deeds, marriage records, letters and diaries.
Dr. Hunt said: "There has been a worldwide movement and interest in the common folk and how they lived. Forget the generals and the queens and the kings. Small-town studies can add up to something that has important implications."
A classic example, Dr. Hunt said, was conducted at Harvard University in the 1960's and 70's. Graduate students in history studied the surrounding small towns of Needham, Dedham, Chelmsford and Concord. "Each student's own local study was not necessarily important in its own right, but the local histories added up to a regional history, which added up to a very important segment," Dr. Hunt said. He added that a study of this type has not yet been done in Westchester.
 
On-Site Experience
 The Institute for Westchester and Local History has the practical goal of linking the college to the many historical organizations in the county as well as in Rockland, Putnam and the Bronx. Through research, teaching and historical preservation, the institute plans to offer students a hands-on approach to history.
The internship program will give students on-site experience in working with documents and archives at more than 50 historical societies, museums and libraries. Students will work with municipal historians as well as at the County Archives. The SUNY Purchase faculty, local historians and scholars in specialized fields will share their expertise.
The program should benefit not only the students but also the organizations for whom they will be working, Dr. Keller said. She said that many such groups are chronically understaffed and underfinanced. When she sent out a questionnaire to historical societies asking if they could use interns, Dr. Keller immediately received 50 requests for 100 interns.
Dr. Keller concluded: "Suppose you put together a study of New Rochelle, Ossining and Yonkers. There is a lot that you can get out of these places that goes far beyond the Revolutionary War: the contributions of the Irish and the railroad and how housing patterns developed and how school systems changed.
"In what sense did this develop our sense of national character? There is tremendous relevance in studying our own backyard."

HEADLINE: A Pilot's Ultimate Flight of Fancy: An Airplane Built at Home

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
SOME people build model rockets. Others might try their hand at a deck or a picnic table. Mathew P. Fairy of Norwalk is building a Sonerai single-engine aircraft in his spare time.
After two years, it still doesn't look like an airplane, he acknowledges, because it's in pieces scattered all over his house.
"It's a tremendously absorbing hobby," Mr. Fairy said. "You work on it in your attic, your basement, your garage. Basically, wherever you have a slab of space, you're putting something together."
 
Putting Passion to the Test
 When he is finished in a few years, he will have a plane that will have cost him about $12,000 that would match a factory-built craft costing well into six figures. Then it will be time to put his passion to the test, and take the first flight. 
 "You really have to believe in your abilities," Mr. Fairy said. "If you're confident with your own work, then do it. If you're not, then go see United Airlines."
Mr. Fairy is among a growing number of Connecticut residents who, for a variety of reasons, are building their own aircraft, said state officers of the Experimental Aircraft Association, a group that promotes private plane-building projects.
 
Cheaper Than Factory Planes
 Experimental aircraft, as owner-built planes are known, are cheaper than factory planes, and because they incorporate newer technology they can often outperform factory craft. In addition, because so many small plane manufacturers have gotten out of the business, there are fewer used factory-built aircraft available on the market each year, so experimental aircraft have eased an availability problem. Membership in the six Connecticut chapters of the association has reached about 1,100, up about 20 percent in the last three years, and some chapters have grown even more quickly.
Earl E. Folsom of Shelton said membership in the Danbury chapter of the association, which he heads, stands at 70 now. There were only 20 members when he joined four years ago. Members have 20 plane-building projects underway, and another 12 have been completed in the last few years, ranging from reproductions of World War I biplanes to a Glassair III that cruises at 265 miles an hour.
"Despite the recession, I'm amazed at how the interest is building," Mr. Folsom said. "Every week I get two or three calls from people interested in building an airplane."
 
Large Turnout at Conference
 Interest in amateur-built aircraft, as they are known, was demonstrated by the turnout at a recent conference at Windham Airport sponsored by the association, the supplier Aircraft Spruce & Specialty, and Kit Planes Magazine. More than 300 people from throughout the Northeast turned out for tips on woodworking, welding, shaping composite materials, using fabric to cover wings, and other tips from professionals.
Dozens of the experimental aircraft were on display, ranging from the conventional (which looked like copies of Cessnas and Pipers), to the rear engine Long-EZ, a modern design that always looks like it's flying backward. People who had built their own designs offered advice to novices. W. R. Keith Browne of Hampton, for instance, was advising people who were interested in the Sonerai 2L design to put on a removable cockpit.
"Heat removal is the big problem," Mr. Browne said as a half dozen people gathered around. "It gets hot in there in the summer. You feel a bit like a casserole." Then he regaled them with tips on grinding rivet head for the least amount of drag on the wings.
The manager of the airport, Norvald Oygard, said when he arrived in 1974 there were perhaps one or two experimental aircraft; today there are 10.
Experimental aircraft can range from airplanes that are constructed entirely from plans and raw materials, to kit airplanes that are put together according to detailed manufacturer's instructions.
 
Aircraft Must Be Inspected
 Experimental aircraft must still be inspected by the Federal Aviation Administration, and they have several restrictions: They must have a label designating the planes as "Experimental" in plain view in the cockpit; there must be a placard displayed in the passenger area noting that it does not meet F.A.A. airworthiness standards; and they cannot be used for commercial purposes.
Still, the restrictions and warnings don't seem to put people off.
"If you're new to general aviation, you might think, 'Build an airplane -- are you kidding?' But with the kits that are out there if you've got some mechanical ability you can do it," said William J. Shanahan of Avon, who is earning his pilot's license and plans to build his own plane. "It's not really as intimidating as it might seem, but it does mean a commitment of time."
 
Anxiety During First Flights
 But Mr. Shanahan said that most pilots would have to feel a little anxiety the first time they take to the sky in something they put together.
"The first flight you'd probably be pretty nervous," Mr. Shanahan said. "You'd probably be thinking the whole time, 'Did I do this right, and did I remember to do that?' But if your own safety is riding on it, you'd pay pretty good attention to detail while you're building it."
Many people contemplating building an aircraft at home will join the association, because the chapters usually will lend specialty tools, have experts who can advise you on construction techniques, and print newsletters announcing upcoming training sessions.
A director of the Hartford chapter, William Welch of Hampton, said the group's 52 members have more than 18 projects underway and another 14 completed in the last few years, so there is a wealth of information available to newcomers.
 
Expensive Factory Planes
 Mr. Welch said it was probably no surprise that Connecticut residents are becoming interested in home-built aircraft, given the state's history in the aviation industry -- Pratt & Whitney in East Hartford and Textron-Lycoming in Stratford have long made aircraft engines, and Sikorsky in Stratford has long made airframes.
Mr. Welch said one reason experimental aircraft were becoming more popular was that the cost of factory planes has become so high, largely because of liability insurance. For an aircraft costing $150,000, $75,0000 will go to the manufacturer's insurance premium.
"The lawyers have wiped out the factory-built market," Mr. Welch said. "The liability situation has just become completely untenable."
In 1992, he said, pilots registered about three times as many amateur built aircraft as factory built.
 
A Few Years of Hobby Work
 The editor of Kit Planes Magazine, David A. Martin, in an interview during the recent conference at Windham Airport, said the Avid Flyer, a kit plane incorporating modern technology, could be built for about $18,000 "and a few years hobby work, nights and weekend in your basement or garage." It compares to the Taylorcraft, which has a $45,000 base price and was designed in the late 1930s.
Then there is the Lancair IV, a kit that has set all kinds of speed records, and will cost perhaps $40,000, including the engine, Mr. Martin said.
"There's really nothing comparable to it commercially," Mr. Martin said. The plane is designed out of composite, making it extremely lightweight, which allows it to outperform the old designs factories keep turning out, he said.
"All of the fastest general aviation airplanes now are home-builts," Mr. Martin said.
 
Hard to Register New Designs
 "In addition, some of them are built by people who want a decent, modern aircraft, which they can't get from a factory," Mr. Welch said. Piper has a 10-year-old design, the Malibu, but most other factory designs are from the 1950's, Mr. Welch said, with much of the technology from 1945. Federal regulations make it so difficult to register new designs for commercial use that plane manufacturers have concentrated on the upper end of the market, such as $1 million corporate jets.
Thomas A. Peghiny, president of Flightstar, a company based at Ellington Airport that makes ultralight aircraft kits, said home-builts are also becoming more popular because as costs decrease general aviation production, there is more space for home-builts at airports.
"We're moving in where the dinosaurs were," Mr. Peghiny said.
Henry M. Bouley Jr., who owns Windham Precision Airparts and operates the Questair kit manufacturer out of Windham Airport, said that kit craft demonstrates the advances that have been made over factory-built craft.
The Venture, one of the kits he sells, has set seven world records in its category for speed, climbing ability, and in other areas. It was the first single plane to cruise at more than 400 miles an hour, averaging 402 during a timed two-hour, nine-minute trip from Chicago's O'Hare Airport to Logan in Boston, and used only 34 gallons of fuel, less than someone would use in a large car.
 
Beating the Judges
 During another time trial in July, Mr. Bouley went from Palm Springs, Calif., to Chicago, about 2,000 miles, and beat the judges, who were flying in a factory-built jet.
"They were supposed to be there to take my picture, but they had a 12 minute fuel stop on the way," Mr. Bouley said. He used 89 gallons; the jet used about 420 gallons.
Mr. Bouley operates a center where people can come in and build their planes under his direction, getting help with some of the tougher jobs, and passing the flight test over to a professional pilot.
The center is booked through mid-1995, and Mr. Bouley is considering opening several others to keep up with demand.
 
'Sense of Accomplishment'
 "There's a tremendous sense of accomplishment, with all the work and sweat and checking and inspecting that goes into a project," Mr. Bouley said. "By the time they actually take it out, they've got years into this thing."
Stuart A. Hipkins of Coventry, who was browsing at the experimental aircraft conference in Windham, said after 10 years as an inspector at Pratt & Whitney Aircraft, he wants to put his knowledge to use building his own plane.
"I've been riding motorcycles since I was 15, and I think flying is safer than bikes. I feel more secure in the air than I do on the ground," Mr. Hipkins said. "And experimental is really the only way for the private pilot to do anything in general aviation these days."

HEADLINE: Main Street's Struggle for Survival

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
DESPITE changes taking place on the street outside his appliance store, Martin H. Painkin still cleaves to a dream that has sustained him for more than four decades: when he retires soon, he wants his two grown sons to carry on the family business.
But on a recent afternoon, as he tallied his ledger at a desk in the rear of Leibert Brothers Appliance Discount Center, the 68-year-old Mr. Painkin momentarily lost heart, worried that his dream might be just that. 
 In White Plains, once known as the City of a Thousand Stores, Mr. Painkin said it has become increasingly difficult for small business owners to make ends meet. Like many other shopkeepers here and those in other downtown areas in the county, his business has been hit hard by competition from large discount stores and malls.
 
Battling Market Forces
 Some storekeepers have packed up and moved away from downtown here -- at recent count, the vacancy rate among the smaller shops on Mamaroneck Avenue and its sidestreets was more than 25 percent, according to the White Plains Merchants Association. And those who remain worry that the old values many small businessmen pride themselves on may no longer be in fashion.
"Main Street U.S.A., personal service, reliability, longevity -- all of the things that we stand for don't seem to matter much anymore," said Mr. Painkin, who bought the store from Jack and Harry Leibert 40 years ago. "Today, there is no such thing as consumer loyalty because the dollar is king."
Like Mr. Painkin and his sons who work with him in the store -- Gerald, 43, and Howard, 39 -- merchants here are battling market forces that threaten their viability, especially as the holiday shopping season approaches. Their struggle is one that is being repeated in many older downtown areas nationwide, experts say.
Across the United States, the recession has dramatically altered consumers' spending habits, driving shoppers to seek bargains and discounts. As in other parts of the country, large discounters in the county -- chain stores like Tops Appliance City in Hawthorne and Bradlees in Yonkers -- have drawn business away from neighborhood shops.
One of the first blows to White Plains shopkeepers came 13 years ago, when the Galleria, an 880,000-square-foot downtown mall, opened. As they have more recently, many neighborhood stores shut their doors then, while others hung on. The area rebounded in time, with new stores moving in, especially during the boom years of the 1980's.
 
A Recession-Related Factor
 More recently, there have been renewed threats to White Plains's downtown shops. Ground was broken earlier this year for a million-square-foot mall, anchored by Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom,on Maple Avenue and Bloomingdale Road. Another mall, which would include Saks Fifth Avenue and Bloomingdale's, is also planned.
Another mall, the Westchester Pavilion, which is to include discount stores like Toys 'R' Us, is about to open at one end of East Post Road, not far from Mr. Painkin's store. Mr. Painkin said that may be "good for my store, or bad," explaining that the shoppers might only stay in the mall and not venture out onto the streets where the smaller stores are. "At the least," he added, "maybe the cars will see Leibert's when they come around the corner."
In addition to competition posed by discounters and malls, there is a recession-related factor that has taken its toll in White Plains: some large corporations like A.T.& T. have moved employees elsewhere, and others like I.B.M. have reduced their staffs -- eroding the base of lunch-time customers who have traditionally patronized local stores.
Edward M. Murray, executive vice president of the Westchester County and White Plains Chambers of Commerce, said: "Our store owners have a three-hour window, 11 A.M. to 2 P.M. And what they don't sell then, they don't sell, because after 6 o'clock in this city, everyone goes home."
White Plains, the county seat and an area dense with office buildings, has a population of 49,000, which swells to 250,000 on weekdays during business hours.
Mr. Murray said that at its peak, in the 1950's and 60's (when East Post Road was known as the Fifth Avenue of White Plains), there were more than 1,000 stores in the downtown White Plains area; today, he said, there are only 314.
"It's also a different mix now," he said. "It used to be old-time U.S.A., and now it's convenience food, a lot of hairdressers and drugstores."
Although small shopkeepers in downtowns nationwide are struggling, experts are optimistic that areas like White Plains will be able to adjust to economic shifts.
 
Different Sets of Circumstances
 Elizabeth M. Rodgers, a partner in Rodgers and McCauley, a Manhattan- and Philadelphia-based retail consulting firm, said: "Main Streets U.S.A., as they have been known, must change. As retail centers, they cannot stay the same in these times.
"Each Main Street has a different set of circumstances, and each has a different set of problems, and although I believe there will always be a Main Street U.S.A., we have to reinvent it." Ms. Rodgers was a consultant for nearby Stamford, which has seen its local merchants threatened by the development of a large mall, the 875,000-square-foot Stamford Town Center.
Her recommendation to small business owners:
"Find a niche in the market and don't duplicate what the big stores are selling."
Julian Didonato, the 40-year-old owner of Dakota Cotton Outpost on Mamaroneck Avenue here, described his store as "a cross between a Gap and an L. L. Bean, but still unique," carrying competitive lines of down jackets, turtleneck shirts and casual outdoor sportswear not found in chain stores. Mr. Didonato said he also caters to a trade seeking the personalized service that mall stores often don't offer.
 
'An Awful Lot of Empty Stores
 Mr. Didonato, president of the 60-member White Plains Merchants Association, also said that if smaller retailers are to compete, they have to cut overhead and become aggressive merchandisers like the discounters. "I'm not making a killing, but I am making a good living," he said. "It just means watching every dime."
Although the Merchants Association said the vacancy rate was 25 percent in the downtown area, the City Planning Department said that their studies showed it was only 13.4 percent. Mr. Murray of the White Plains Chamber of Commerce said, "Whatever it is, if you take a look at the downtown, there are an awful lot of empty stores."
At the Washington-based International Downtown Association, which represents nearly 700 members, Dale D. Doyle, director of program development and communications, agreed that in addition to smart merchandising, small stores need to offer something different.
"A mall is a mall is a mall," she said. "And by that I mean, they are all the same. You can predict the mix -- a Gap, a Banana Republic. Downtown areas, by contrast, can present a unique mix."
Some downtowns, like Bronxville's, have found the mix, she said, "causing drivers to go out of their way to find that something different."
Joy A. Kilbourn, president of Bronxville's 230-member Chamber of Commerce and owner of Cliffhangers, an upscale gift shop in the village, said local shopkeepers were not threatened by nearby malls because they had "cut out a niche in the market and were therefore able to hold onto the independent retailer."
 
Optimistic Outlook
 Peter Mosbacher, executive director of the New York Main Street Alliance, based in Mount Kisco, said the emphasis in that community is on "shops that offer services for the people who live and work here." The alliance is a statewide nonprofit organization that assists downtown revitalization projects.
Mr. Mosbacher added: "The question has to be, 'What can we sell that Wal-Mart does not?' Main Street merchants may have to wake up and face the fact that the days of customer loyalty are over, but that doesn't mean Main Street is dead."
Leon Silverman, a White Plains Realtor, said, "It is a matter of making the city more user friendly," by offering better parking and other amenities "to compete with the malls."
Mr. Painkin said he is optimistic that the efforts of the merchants' association and pledges made by a new administration coming in to City Hall will help revitalize the downtown area. During his campaign, Mayor-Elect Sy J. Schulman promised to address the problems faced by small businessmen.
"I'm still hopeful," Mr. Painkin said. "But if after all this time, we had to shut the door, I would wonder, What have I done with 40 years of my life? Both sons have been with me here since they were each 9 years old, sweeping floors, dusting. Now they are my partners, and I would be so sad to see that go."

HARVEY SLUMFENBURGER'S CHRISTMAS PRESENT
Written and illustrated by John Burningham.
Unpaged. Cambridge, Mass.

 THERE are good tidings for parents fed up with the commercialization of Christmas in John Burningham's latest picture book, a hardscrabble but unsentimental tale of the tough work and valiant efforts that go into making the holiday pay off for the kids in these economically strained times. Just as Mr. Burningham's pooped, blue-collar Santa is sacking out after his annual gift-giving run, he notices that a single present for little Harvey Slumfenburger, a poor boy who lives in a hut at the top of the Roly Poly Mountain "far, far away," has gone undelivered. Dragging himself back out of bed, Santa earnestly schleps halfway around the world in order to deliver the precious parcel.
After young readers watch old Santa trudge over tundra, motorbike across ice, skate, ski and scale his way to young Harvey's bedside, they can't help being impressed. They'll realize that some of us work to make Christmas happen. "Harvey Slumfenburger's Christmas Present" is a book that encourages gratitude.
It also encourages careful and repeated readings. Mr. Burningham, whose books, from "Mr. Gumpy's Outing" to "Hey! Get Off Our Train," are enjoyed here and in Britain, has, in fact, tucked plenty of nifty gifts into his prose and illustrations, but they are not wrapped in flash and dazzle. His palette -- ranging from pale washes of pink to daunting black fields -- is richly sophisticated, and his subtly emotive figures are more like the cartoons in The New Yorker than the ones on Saturday morning television. Adults will get great pleasure out of teaching children how much there is to appreciate here.
You can elicit laughter by pointing out the bedpan discreetly provided for the sick reindeer tucked in their cozy beds (the fact that this Santa has only two deer -- and no elves -- suggests that hard times have reached the North Pole, too). You can summon up awe through the vast, Rothko-like sweeps of color signifying the tremendous distances Santa must travel to reach the Slumfenburger home. You can offer a lesson in politeness and modesty when, each time he meets a helpful stranger, Santa reaches out his white-gloved hand and says, "Excuse me, my name is Santa Claus."
"Harvey Slumfenburger's Christmas Present" is at once accessible and challenging, a book with a simple initial appeal that doesn't spoon-feed readers its deeper delights. The detailed texturing of Mr. Burningham's pen and watercolor illustrations, from the beautiful blue striations of sky that Santa traverses in a yellow biplane to the tiny town scratched into the paint at the foot of a mountain landscape, reveals more elements with each examination.
On the last page, curly-haired Harvey wakes up on Christmas morning to receive his one little gift, tagged with his name and wrapped in polka-dotted paper. The parting stroke is Mr. Burningham's refusal to reveal what's in the box. He leaves it to readers to conclude that the real gift, like the bulk of his tale, is in the giving. This is one sweet raisin of a book. Its wrinkle on the holidays is much needed.
