HEADLINE: Excerpts From Speech Of Rowland to Legislature

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Jan. 6

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the State of the State address delivered today by Gov. John G. Rowland to a joint session of the Connecticut General Assembly as recorded by The New York Times:
A few moments ago, I took the oath of office to serve as your Governor, an honor that humbles me and an honor that challenges me to build upon the successes that we've all had together during the last four years. As our state of Connecticut approaches the next century, we are poised for continued and expanding prosperity. Ladies and gentlemen, this will be Connecticut's century. I guarantee you of that. 
 The world economy has changed dramatically over the last 10 years, and for much of that time Connecticut was in a period of adjustment. But we've adapted to the changing times, and now Connecticut is on the field and we are a first class competitor.
Our job -- all of our jobs, working together in state government -- is to create an environment which allows for continued economic growth. A vibrant, growing economy is the only factor that guarantees more Connecticut residents will share in this period of prosperity that we all enjoy. And it's important that we not lose sight of the fundamental policies that have put us into such a strong position. . . .
There is a new spirit in this state. There is a new optimism. There is a new hope. Four years ago, I called it "Connecticut's Comeback." Well, today we are back. We're back. We're stronger and more vibrant than ever, ready to make the next 100 years Connecticut's century.
But to do so, we must have the vision to look beyond the status quo. To raise expectations for our government, to raise expectations for our schools, for our cities, for our families, to raise expectations for ourselves -- always making our state more attractive to the next generation. That's what this is all about.
Over the last four years, we have proven that government can be prudent and it can be compassionate. We have proven that we can act with our hearts and our minds.
These may be dark days in our nation's capital, but they are not dark days in Connecticut's capital. Together, we have rejected the politics of personal attack that has paralyzed our Federal Government. And you know what we've practiced? We've practiced what I call the politics of results. The people of this state deserve nothing less. We were not sent here to do personal or partisan battle with each other. We were sent here to do the people's business.
If we can always keep that in mind, there is no limit to what we can achieve on behalf of the people of this state. Let's build on this record of the last four years. Let's use the offices that we've been elected to to set a leadership example for all to see -- and for all of us to be proud of. Thank you -- thank you all so very much. And God bless the great state of Connecticut.

HEADLINE: Rowland Vows to Rein In State Spending

BYLINE: By MIKE ALLEN 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Jan. 6

 BODY:
John Grosvenor Rowland showed two political faces as he was inaugurated today for a second term as Governor of Connecticut, calling for civility and moderation in government even as he vowed to rein in state spending despite the economic boom.
Mr. Rowland, a Republican who at 41 is the nation's youngest Governor, used his inaugural address to project the more inclusive air that several Republican governors have urged their national party to adopt. Then, after a 19-howitzer salute, he took a ceremonial stroll across the Capitol to a joint session of the General Assembly and delivered a State of the State address stressing the conservative touchstones that characterized most of his first term. 
 "Yes, we've had some great economic times," he told the legislators, several of whom wore corsages and boutonnieres for the big day. "But that is no reason for us to return to the days of big spending and tax increases. Our greatest challenge, over the next four years, will be to continue to control the cost and the growth of state government."
Aides said that his budget, to be presented early next month, would not grow much over last year's and that the rise was likely to be less than the inflation rate, now about 2 percent. That would leave little room for new programs proposed by legislators as they contemplated a budget surplus of as much as $500 million.
"A lean government, free of excess programs, excessive rules and regulations, helps us keep our budget in balance," the Governor said. "It helps us provide tax relief. It helps us create economic opportunities. Keeping a lid on the growth of government also gives us the option to invest wisely when the opportunity presents itself."
He also called on Connecticut to resist "the politics of personal attack that has paralyzed our Federal Government," and offered instead a "politics of results."
"When legitimate differences over policy descend into bitter partisanship, the result is inaction, gridlock and the failure of leadership," he said. "The winner in such a power struggle wins control of a government that is powerless to do any public good."
Choirs lined the escalators and spectators jammed five floors of balconies as Governor Rowland took the oath of office in the atrium of the Legislative Office Building, which adjoins the Capitol. The ceremony had been moved from the traditional location outside the Capitol in the hope that Mr. Rowland's father, Sherwood Rowland, who has liver cancer, would be able to administer the oath, as he had in 1995, but he had to stay home in Waterbury.
Mr. Rowland's voice cracked as he dedicated "this historic day to my father."
The Governor's message today was softer than his first inaugural address, in which he warned against "the notion that the state government is the fountain of endless favors." Today, he emphasized the more moderate themes that helped him easily win re-election in November.
"As we look forward to the next century, our responsibility is to redefine the role of state government," he said. "Policies of inclusion must be practiced at every level of government."
Declaring that Connecticut "leads the nation in public civility," he said, "The most important example we can set for ourselves and future leaders is to continue that spirit of cooperation and mutual respect."
In his speech to the legislature, the Governor Rowland reiterated his plans to redevelop the downtowns of the state's largest cities and said he hoped to "cut additional taxes, whenever and wherever possible."
Democrats, who control both houses of the legislature, gave the Governor generally good, if guarded, reviews. "He seems comfortable, both as a matter of politics and policy, governing from the center," said George C. Jepsen, the Senate majority leader.
Representative William R. Dyson, who is co-chairman of the Appropriations Committee, said it would be difficult to finance all the programs the Governor mentioned and still hold back spending. "He's going to have to be the wizard, or we're going to have to be the wizards," Mr. Dyson said.
Mr. Rowland, the state's 86th Governor, is the first Republican to be sworn in for a second term since Gov. Raymond E. Baldwin in 1945. Governor Rowland and his wife, Patty, were bundled up and rosy-cheeked as they led a parade from the Old State House, a brick-and-granite landmark in downtown Hartford that once was the Connecticut Capitol and calls itself the nation's oldest surviving seat of government. The parade included 15 bands and military marching units, along with a 1936 Dodge Phaeton.
Carlos Ortiz, 11, a sixth grader from Hartford, may have taken the day's message of outreach a little more to heart than Governor Rowland would appreciate. Apparently mixing up his stocky authority figures, he blurted as the Governor passed by, "It's Bill Clinton!"

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
The President's plan on tax credits for the disabled has new ideas but also serious problems.

BYLINE: By Michael M. Weinstein 

 BODY:
President Clinton's proposal to use tax credits to help about two million disabled Americans, many of whom depend on relatives for long-term care, includes some innovative ideas, but it also has some serious problems.
John Rother, public policy director of the American Association of Retired Persons, applauds the program for "providing overdue recognition and support for caregivers." 
 Stuart Altman, a health economist at Brandeis, agrees, praising the White House for "making a real start on a real problem."
But even they recognize the plan's serious limitations. Critics say the proposal skips over most of the poor, provides small financial protection for middle-class families and largely overlooks the potential for private insurance to handle the problem.
Mr. Clinton's advisers fully recognize the problems with their proposal. But they operate under rigid budget rules that make it nearly impossible to solve social problems the old-fashioned way, through Government spending.
Tight caps on discretionary spending for next year leave little room for new programs. Instead, Henry Aaron of the Brookings Institution says, "the proposal is testimony to a budgetary staitjacket that forces the Administration to cast social policy as tax cuts -- the only budget idea Congress will take seriously -- even when, as is true in this case, the tax code is poorly designed to deliver the needed relief."
The Administration estimates that five million Americans receive long-term care for a disabling physical or mental ailment. About two million of them live in nursing homes. The rest live in their communities with the help of relatives or other care providers. The cost can be crushing. Nursing homes can charge $60,000 a year or more. If the disabled stay home, then children or spouses are often forced to leave work and suffer the grinding stress of caring for desperately ill loved ones.
There are few sources of financial relief. Medicare provides nearly none, and Medicaid pays for nursing homes but only after patients run through nearly all of their assets. That is not the worst of all possible systems -- it takes care of poor families from the beginning and tells middle-class families that they must spend their own money before calling on taxpayers to pick up the rest of the tab. But the system turns medical catastrophe into financial catastrophe unless the patient can figure out, legally or otherwise, how to transfer assets to family and friends before applying for Medicaid.
One solution is for adults to buy insurance to cover the costs of long-term care. But private insurance barely exists. The problem is that 60-year-olds have no way to know how much protection they are buying when they take out a policy that covers, say, $150 a day -- even if adjusted for inflation -- of nursing home care. That might look good in 1999, but how much care will it buy 10 or 20 years from now?
The Administration's solution is to cut the taxes of chronically disabled patients or their family care providers by up to $1,000. The tax cuts will cost a modest $5.5 billion over five years and will probably be paid for, the Administration says, by closing an unspecified list of tax loopholes. The proposed tax credit is based on the patient's need, not expenditures, so the program does not steer the elderly into nursing homes in order to qualify for reimbursement.
The most interesting part of the plan would have the Federal Government offer long-term care insurance to its employees. The idea is for the Government to create model policies that could then spread through the private economy.
The problem with the plan starts with the tax credit. It only helps families who pay taxes, thereby eliminating the poor. And, Mr. Aaron points out, many elderly fall into the no-tax category because Social Security income is largely untaxed. The Administration hopes it has improved the problem by offering the credit to family care providers, thereby expanding the pool of eligible people. Still, the proposal shuts out many poor families.
The Administration's strategy is to focus on a big expense of middle-class families and tee up a tax cut that Republicans find hard to resist. The White House calculates that tax cuts do a little good and blunt Republican fervor for big across-the-board cuts that would threaten spending on programs dear to Democrats.
The political tactic is understandable but comes at great cost. In the case of long-term care, Mr. Clinton steered clear of readily available and potentially effective solutions. New York and several other states have created, with the help of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a marvelously designed answer. New Yorkers can buy a state-approved insurance policy, typically costing about $2,000 a year, that reimburses the policyholder for three years of nursing home expenses. If patients who buy the coverage eventually enter and stay in a nursing home for more than three years, then the state Medicaid program pays whatever bills the patient cannot handle based on income. In other words, the state does not invade the patient's savings. The families win protection of their assets. The state wins, too, because few patients actually stay in nursing homes for more than three years.

HEADLINE: Pataki Offers Light Agenda, Setting Aside Budget Surplus

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 6

 BODY:
Treading cautiously as he begins his second term, Gov. George E. Pataki today delivered a State of the State Message notably light on new initiatives, while proposing that the state's budget surplus be set aside to pay for the ballooning tax cuts already enacted.
The Governor's plan to salt away most of a budget surplus that is expected to reach $2 billion is certain to be a flash point in his relations with the Senate and Assembly, because it would deny the Legislature one of its favorite roles, dividing up the spoils of a healthy economy. While legislators might balk at creating a reserve fund, they also realize that Mr. Pataki can achieve the same end by vetoing spending they approve, as he did last year. 
 Mr. Pataki's annual speech to the Legislature, his first major policy address since his re-election two months ago, was heavy on criminal justice proposals: abolishing parole, logging the DNA of all felons into a computer database and increasing penalties for underage offenders.
But he paid little attention to an issue that he had pledged in October to make one of his priorities, reforming the state's campaign finance laws. He had refused before the election to say what those changes might be, and today he devoted only half a sentence in his hourlong speech to the topic, saying that he would like to see the system changed, but not how.
After two years in which conservative groups have accused him of runaway spending, the Republican Governor pledged a return to the budget stringency he brought to Albany four years ago, proposing an amendment to the State Constitution to require a two-thirds vote of both houses of the Legislature to increase taxes. "The act of raising taxes is a destructive act, and should therefore be a difficult act," he said.
He promised that his budget would increase spending at less than the rate of inflation. And he proposed requiring that two-thirds of the voters, rather than the current simple majority, approve local school districts' property tax increases.
"We must take bold steps to insure that this government continues to live within its means," he said in the newly renovated Assembly chamber. "To protect taxpayers now and in the future, we must make lower taxes and fiscal integrity the law of the land in New York State."
But the speech was most striking for what it omitted, as the Governor avoided the most divisive issues facing the state. And for the first time since he took office, he did not use the address to propose tax cuts.
Health care was a major issue in last year's campaigns, and it promises to be one of this year's legislative battlegrounds, with New York facing a rapid rise in the number of uninsured people, the expiration of its law governing hospital charges and growing calls to regulate health maintenance organizations. Yet Mr. Pataki said little about health care.
Nor did he repeat his call for a law guaranteeing women's access to family planning clinics, first made after a Buffalo doctor who performed abortions was murdered. And he did not repeat his frequent call to restrict late-term abortions.
Legislators on both sides of the aisle were in agreement that the speech had almost as much to do with Mr. Pataki's ambitions for national office in 2000 as with New York's concerns. Democrats accused the Governor of showing his most conservative face to appeal to Republican voters in other states.
Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, said New Yorkers "don't want to know if in Arizona they're impressed with a two-thirds vote" to raise taxes.
More surprising was the response of Republican legislators, who had unanimously refused to discuss openly the Governor's national prospects when he was running for re-election. Today, the script had obviously changed, as they sought out reporters to crow that Mr. Pataki had demonstrated his presidential bona fides.
"It was an eminently presidential speech," said Senator Roy M. Goodman, a Manhattan Republican. "It touched on a number of areas which make New York a national model."
Nearly all the Governor's proposals seemed aimed for rocky shoals. The Democrats who control the Assembly objected to nearly all of his criminal justice plans and said his budgeting notions would hinder their plans to spend money on schools.
The Republican leaders of the Senate objected that Mr. Pataki's plan to save the surplus would stand in the way of lower taxes. "We see it as a pot for tax cuts," said Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate majority leader.
The icy relations Mr. Pataki has with the Democrats were amply on display today. His speech drew lusty applause and cheers from the south side of the Assembly chamber, where the Republicans were seated, while the Democrats made barely enough noise to scare off a flock of birds. They later criticized the address as shallow. "It was a speech for speech sake," Mr. Silver said.
The Governor spent far more time dwelling on the accomplishments of his first term, particularly the deep tax cuts, than laying out a vision for the second. And he continued to slay the dragons of 1994, when he was first elected. "In New York," he said, "government had become that uninvited dinner guest, who arrived too early, ate too much and stayed too long." Later, he referred to the bad old days before his ascension, when "New York was leading the nation in violent crime."
Mr. Pataki revived a number of proposals he has made in the past, including tougher penalties for juvenile criminals, a law against hate crimes, eliminating tenure for school principals, giving teachers the right to expel chronic trouble-makers from their classrooms, and sending immigrant children to summer school to learn English.
Among the new ideas in the speech was one long advocated by environmentalists: expansion of the state's Superfund program for cleaning up toxic waste sites to include hundreds of less severely polluted tracts.
He also called for the creation of a biotechnology research center in Buffalo, to be run by the State University of New York and the Roswell Park Cancer Institute.
The Governor's only proposals on health care were to have schools take a greater role in caring for children with diabetes, and a pilot project for more aggressive treatment of childhood asthma.
The plan to save this year's surplus for future use was a nod to the independent fiscal monitors who warn that the state will have trouble paying for the tax cuts it has already enacted, but which have not yet come due -- more than $4 billion a year. The tax cuts, including reductions in property and business taxes, and ending the sales tax on clothing, are being phased in over five years.
Enacting a requirement for a two-thirds vote to raise taxes is an even taller order. To change the State Constitution, both houses of the Legislature would have to approve the amendment, in two consecutive two-year sessions, and then it would have to be approved by the voters. Today, many Democrats in the Assembly were declaring the idea dead on arrival.
"What he's trying to do is limit the ability to legislate," said Assemblyman Herman D. Farrell Jr., the Manhattan Democrat who chairs the Ways and Means Committee. "I'm opposed to that."
The Democrats were also lukewarm to the Governor's ideas on crime. Mr. Silver said he would not object to expanding the DNA database -- which now collects samples from people convicted of certain violent felonies -- but saw no reason to include, for instance, tax evaders.
And the Democrats were especially wary about the proposal to end parole, saying they could not react until they saw detailed legislation. In general, the proposal would end the longstanding practice of sentencing criminals to a range of time in prison, with the possibility of early release by the Parole Board, and replace that with specific sentences.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Dow and the Other Leading Gauges Advance to Highs

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Stock prices rocketed to new heights yesterday, with the Dow Jones industrial average breaking the 9,500 mark as it climbed 233.78 points, the biggest gain since Oct. 15, to pass its previous record set just before Thanksgiving.
The blue-chip gauge joined the Standard & Poor's 500-stock and Nasdaq composite indexes in uncharted territory as investors threw bonuses, dividends, holiday gifts and retirement and reinvestment money into the market at the beginning of the new year. 
 Overseas markets also powered ahead, with gains in Europe, the Far East and Brazil mostly equaling the American performance. Mexico, however, fell slightly.
"This new-year rally has got real legs," said David G. Dietze, president of Point View Financial Services in Summit, N. J. "Instead of just big-cap and tech stocks doing well, the sectors broadened out to include financials, energy and some deep cyclicals."
The Dow, which rose 2.51 percent, to 9,544.97, was paced by American Express, up 4 5/16, to 103 5/8, and J. P. Morgan, up 3 7/8, to 111 1/4. But four other components surged more than 3 points, six rose 2 or more and only I.B.M., off 7/8, at 188 3/4, was lower.
Even steel stocks, which by some measures are at their lowest point in a generation, caught fire yesterday after an analyst at Merrill Lynch raised his ratings and price targets for various companies. USX-U.S. Steel jumped 2 15/16, to 27 7/16, and Bethlehem Steel added 1 5/16, to 10 9/16.
Dollar Tree Stores, which paced the retail group, soared 5 5/16, to 48 1/2, after the discounter reported a big gain in sales.
Among the stocks benefiting from the settlement of the National Basketball Association labor dispute, which will salvage more than half the season, were Boston Celtics, up 4 1/8, to 14 5/8, and Nike, up 2 15/16, to 43 5/8.
Trading was heavy as the market started strong and worked steadily higher until just after 3 P.M., when it reached a Dow peak of 9,608.05 before plateauing to the close.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 986.9 million shares, the fifth-busiest day on record, while 1.2 billion shares changed hands on Nasdaq, the most in a month.
Advancing issues on the Big Board, whose own composite index also set a record at 611.01, outnumbered declining issues by 2,009 to 1,120, with 154 stocks making new highs and 15 new lows.
The gain for the S.& P. 500 was 27.56 points, to a new high of 1,272.34, or 2.21 percent, somewhat less than the blue-chip Dow industrials. But the Nasdaq gain was 69.59, to a new high of 2,320.86, or 3.09 percent. Microsoft, up 4 3/4, to 151 1/4, and Intel, up 6 1/4, to 129 1/2, contributed to the jump, but Yahoo, up 33 1/8, to 291, and Amazon.com, up 13 1/2, to 138, had the more eye-popping moves.
Airlines also saw prominent gains as Delta Air Lines climbed 5, to 59 1/2; UAL rose 4 3/8, to 68, and AMR added 3 13/16, to 67 7/8. Brokers also thrived, the biggest gains being 4 7/16, to 53 5/8, for Lehman Brothers; 4 5/8, to 58 7/8, for Charles Schwab, and 4 9/16, to 41 15/16, for Paine Webber.
Gains in leading foreign markets amounted to 3.41 percent in Frankfurt, 3.20 percent in London, 2.24 percent in Paris, 3.09 percent in Sao Paulo, 3.47 percent in Hong Kong and 1.78 percent in Tokyo.

Bond Prices Rise
By Bloomberg News
Bonds rose for the first time in four sessions yesterday as the highest yields in six weeks and a rally in the dollar lured investors to Treasuries.
After bonds slumped in recent days, "yields became attractive," said Alan Day, who helps oversee almost $4 billion at Stratevest Group in Burlington, Vt. "They're a better deal right now."
The 30-year bond rose 22/32, to 101 12/32, pushing yields down 4 basis points to 5.16 percent. Prices and yields move in opposite directions.
Bonds also derived strength from a gain in the value of the dollar, which enhanced the appeal of dollar-denominated investments to foreign investors who must convert their proceeds to other currencies. Treasuries "are following the dollar," said John Burgess, who oversees about $90 billion at Bankers Trust.
Following are the results of the Treasury's auction yesterday of 10-year inflation-indexed notes:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)
 
High Price . . . 99.811
High Yield . . . 3.898%
Low Yield . . . 3.850%
Median Yield . . . 3.885%

Return to Work Prompts General Feeling of Relief

BYLINE: By JUDY BATTISTA 

 BODY:
For Jalen Rose of the Indiana Pacers, there were no high-fives in the elevators or chest-thumps in the lobby of the GM Building as scores of National Basketball Association players, grimaces chiseled on their faces, made their way from yesterday's meeting to ratify the new collective bargaining agreement.
"I'm upset," Rose said. "I just spent $2,000 on a plane ticket, and I'm getting dressed and I hear they got a deal done and I'm like, 'Why did I come?' " 
 The emotions that dominate so many games were nowhere to be found as players -- who had traveled to New York expecting to vote on whether they supported the union's negotiating committee -- instead learned that a deal had been struck early yesterday morning, ending the 191-day dispute. Many left the building with little or no comment, wending through a horde of autograph seekers.
Most players were more relieved -- and resigned -- than angry.
"I'm glad they came to an agreement," the San Antonio Spurs' David Robinson said after the players' two-hour meeting. "The whole issue is, we were going to take a pay cut no matter what. We knew we were going to go backward. Most guys understand this is business, not personal.
"We don't have anything against David Stern," Robinson added, referring to the N.B.A. commissioner. "He's obviously done a great job building up this league. The players have done a great job building up this league. And it's now time for us to get back together and re-establish some confidence with the fans.
"This thing was really ugly; not just ugly for us, but for fans, for the people who work at arenas, for all the people who love the N.B.A. It's time for us to show them how much we do care about playing this game."
But it was obvious that the tension that had permeated the lockout lingered at the meeting. In the days leading to the tentative settlement, an increasing number of players had expressed discontent with the negotiations. Terry Cummings of the Knicks said that players, many of whom he thought were ill informed about the negotiations, would have been divided if the vote to endorse the negotiating committee's actions had been taken.
"We weren't that far apart, and every time we got off the issues, we got more involved in ego and pride, and that was hindering the process," Cummings said. "The fans deserve better. The game is more important than the players and the owners. The owners pay the players to play the game, and the fans pay the salaries for players to play.
"We have to understand the economics of the game. We can't afford to let something like this happen to our game. Our game is not as old as baseball, and we can't afford a lapse like baseball had. We have to be more concerned about the overall perception of ourselves and our game."
The Nets' Jayson Williams had been one of the most outspoken critics of the way negotiations had progressed, and had repeatedly suggested that an arbitrator be brought in to expedite a settlement. Last week, the Knicks' Patrick Ewing, the union president, criticized Williams for making his complaints public. In yesterday's meeting, Williams -- who had not attended earlier gatherings -- came face to face with Ewing, an encounter Williams said was intense.
"I'm not taking credit for this thing," Williams said when asked if he thought his comments had led the union to make a deal. "Give it to the guys on the executive board. I just did what I had to do to get them to play basketball. I wasn't going against the union. I'm 100 percent union the whole time. I'm proud of David Stern and I'm proud of Patrick Ewing. They'll probably hate me for the next two or three weeks, but I'll make them love me again."
If Williams was in his usual mood to joke, few others were.
"It was scary," the Boston Celtics' Kenny Anderson said. "The last two nights I couldn't sleep."
Even Charles Barkley, who is never at a loss for a quip, seemed somber as he made his way to the meeting.
"It's fair enough and we have to accept it," said Barkley, a free agent. "We couldn't cancel the season. Obviously, there's been some damage done to the game. Both owners and players have done a disservice to the game. Some of the fans are going to be mad. But you can't worry about that. I'd say to the fans: 'If you want to come to the game, come. If you don't, we still have to do our jobs.' "
And in the end, it seemed, players were grateful that at least they had a job for the next few months. The Toronto Raptors' Kevin Willis, who had been critical of the union recently, said he expected the animosity that had driven this lockout to end.
"My thing is to start playing basketball again," Willis said. "Forget about the nonsense, the greed, and seeing how much money you can get. If we can split the money, so be it. Anything else is absolutely ridiculous."

HEADLINE: A Pataki Reprise

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 6

 BODY:
Rather than seeing his convincing re-election victory as a mandate for daring new initiatives, Gov. George E. Pataki seemed determined today to give New Yorkers more of what so many of them liked the first time around.
He could have used his annual address to the Legislature to try and set his second term apart from his first. He could have made bold promises and electric commitments. But the Governor instead hewed to his longstanding priorities: curbing state spending, cutting taxes and toughening the criminal justice system. 
 "We've laid a solid foundation on which to build," he said in a speech so narrowly focused that it at times sounded repetitious.
His stance had some of the Capitol cognoscenti griping about an uninspiring performance and neglected opportunities. But Mr. Pataki believes that with a disciplined agenda, he will preserve the successes of his first term, allowing him to cement his legacy in New York and giving him a platform to broaden his reputation nationally, his advisers say.
In a sense, the speech showed how much he has staked his political future on a handful of landmark changes that he has wrought in New York as the first Republican governor in a generation. It suggested that Mr. Pataki feels that if these policies are imperiled, then so is he.
"In four years, we have cut taxes and created a stronger economy by suppressing government's built-in tendency to grow and spend," he said, calling for a "continued commitment to fiscal prudence."
The Governor, an erstwhile legislator who fancies himself a student of Albany, recognizes that successes here can be short-lived. Democratic lawmakers tried to block most of his first-term accomplishments, particularly his effort to impose more fiscal restraint. They largely failed, but would no doubt like to scale back some of Governor's big-ticket items, like a big income tax cut and stiffer criminal sentences. Even Republicans in the Legislature have not always been the Governor's most reliable backers.
Mr. Pataki's two centerpiece fiscal proposals today -- to squirrel away the state's surplus of about $2 billion, and to require a two-thirds majority of the Legislature to approve tax increases -- seem intended to thwart any legislative attempt to undermine his fiscal record.
If the state spent the surplus, and then the economy slumped, the Governor might have to choose between steep, unpopular spending cuts or repealing his beloved tax cuts -- a damaging fate that befell his predecessor, Mario M. Cuomo.
Maintaining his fiscal record, and therefore succeeding with his new proposals, could have an important impact on the Governor's future; if he decides to run for national office in 2000, his handling of the state budget would be important evidence of his Republican bona fides.
"There has been a succession of initiatives that he can dutifully herald," said Senator Stephen M. Saland, a Poughkeepsie Republican, who, like many of the Governor's allies, was eager to talk about Mr. Pataki's future outside of the state. "Certainly, I believe that he was talking to a national audience."
The Governor is expected to use these achievements to try to fend off attacks from more conservative national Republicans over his support for abortion rights and other moderate positions on social issues. Mr. Pataki's advisers contend that the way to succeed nationally is to get across the message that the party will flourish by concentrating on such fundamental issues as as tax cuts or welfare -- and avoiding contentious social matters.
And who better to lead that charge than Mr. Pataki, who tamed the liberal Empire State?
Some of the advisers also think that it would be foolish to interpret the Governor's landslide in November as a signal that the public wants him to venture into new areas. People voted for Mr. Pataki, these advisers contend, because they are pleased with his record on crime, welfare and taxes, and to divert from this path will only disappoint them.
The risk is that New Yorkers will chafe at the Governor's reluctance to take on other issues, and some Democrats today repeatedly brought up matters that they thought he had ignored in his speech. Assemblyman Richard N. Gottfried of Manhattan, chairman of the Assembly Health Committee, reeled off a list of major health-care matters that Mr. Pataki did not mention, from the problem of people without health insurance to regulation of H.M.O.'s.
"If you listened to his speech, you would think that the issues didn't exist, let alone any plan to solve them," Mr. Gottfried said.
Of course, Mr. Pataki will tackle many matters in the coming months that he did not discuss today. Governors typically use their addresses to the Legislature to establish themes for their dealings with lawmakers, not to present lists of proposals.
Even so, Democrats criticized the Governor's vision. "He missed a golden opportunity to reach out and talk about areas that need job development in the city of New York and which really did not support him last time," said Assemblyman Roberto Ramirez, the Bronx Democratic leader.
But by doing it his way, Mr. Pataki sought to insure that the battle between lawmakers and the Governor -- an annual inevitable event -- would be fought on his terms, not theirs.

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
In the latest sign of trouble in the oil industry, the Phillips Petroleum Company is cutting 1,400 jobs worldwide to save money in the face of low oil and chemical prices. Most of the eliminated jobs will be in exploration and production. Phillips, which employs 17,200 workers worldwide, plans to eliminate 550 jobs from its foreign operations and 850 positions in the United States. About 400 jobs are to be cut at its headquarters in Bartlesville, Okla. W.

Cone Mills, the world's largest denim fabric maker, is closing its plant in Salisbury, N.C., with 625 employees and trimming corporate staff as part of a reorganization plan to increase earnings. The company employs more than 6,000 workers at nine plants in North Carolina and South Carolina and a joint venture plant in Mexico. Cone Mills also said earnings for the fourth quarter of 1998 would be lower than analysts' expectations as a result of the cutbacks along with reduced shipments of denim and yarn-dyed sportswear fabrics.

HEADLINE: A Diplomatic Look Back at a Met Career

BYLINE: By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI 

 BODY:
In more than a dozen years as president and chief executive of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, William H. Luers never really spoke out about the nation's biggest art museum or his tenure there. That was the deal he cut with the museum's director, Philippe de Montebello.
Mr. de Montebello, though technically his subordinate, rules over the Met's art, and has always aspired to hold both jobs one day, as most museum directors do. "We agreed it was essential that he be the voice of the museum," Mr. Luers said. 
On Jan. 31, Mr. Luers, a tall, tweedy former career diplomat, will be handing over the chief executive's post to Mr. de Montebello. On a recent day, sitting at the big round table in his office, he offered his thoughts as he prepared to depart for his new job as chairman and president of the United Nations Association of the U.S.A.
In a wide-ranging interview, Mr. Luers took credit for professionalizing the Met's staff and for being -- if not the public "voice" -- at least "Mr. Outside" to city and state administrators. He predicted that the museum would grow in importance if it tapped into new media like the Internet. And he recalled his fondest moment as the day that Met officials, courting Walter H. Annenberg, showed him a model of the galleries they had designed in hopes of gaining his huge trove of Impressionist paintings. By the look in Mr. Annenberg's eyes, Mr. Luers knew the museum had clinched his bequest of the works.
Mr. Luers said that the Met was bursting at its seams and working hard to expand bathrooms and other amenities for crowds that often reach 30,000 to 40,000 on Saturdays and Sundays. "Whether there's an outside limit that says on a Sunday you can take only 50,000, I don't know," he said.
Ever the diplomat, Mr. Luers said his sharing of power with Mr. de Montebello, however strained their relationship sometimes was, served its purpose. "I think it worked because the trustees wanted it to work," he said. Mr. Luers had only a mild warning for Mr. de Montebello, who is assuming the chief executive's post as well as remaining director, a job he has held for 21 years. "There are a lot of very complicated management issues," Mr. Luers said. "And he has 18 curatorial departments. It just places a tremendous strain on the director. But I think he will be fine."
Putting his best spin on their relationship, Mr. Luers said, "Inevitably, we had moments of disagreement because of our positions." He declined to discuss specifics but characterized them as things like the pace of upgrading administrative systems and computerization.
"But we worked it out, and I think he's comfortable with the pace now and he's behind it," Mr. Luers said. "There have also been some disagreements about individual people who would be hired. But these were momentary differences."
On some occasions, he said, when the two disagreed, they relied on other executives at museum."When they saw us talk about an issue, they made sure we faced issues together," he said.
Mr. de Montebello, noting that "identical twins and married couples have moments of disagreement, too," also played down their differences. "We have become a very large museum with a big budget, and he has put a structure in place and a staff and an overall administrative complex that runs very smoothly," Mr. de Montebello said.
The Met has a $116.5 million annual budget and 1,800 full-time employees.
Mr. Luers had agreed to retire when he turned 70 this year, on May 15. He accelerated his departure after he was asked o to lead the United Nations Association, which does research and organizes chapters of United Nations supporters.
Museum trustees and other Met-watchers agree with Mr. Luers's assessment of his contributions and add another: his nonstop entertaining of donors, potential donors, well-placed politicians and other powers that might be able to help the Met. Much of that took place at the Met-owned apartment he occupies with his wife, Wendy.
"He's indefatigable," said Carl Spielvogel, a trustee. "I don't know many people willing to be out at breakfast, lunch and dinner seven days a week, but he was. And he was very good at it."
No one expects Mr. de Montebello, who is far less outgoing, to pick up that particular mantle (although Mr. Spielvogel, who used to head the museum's business committee, said, "Philippe said to me at one point, 'Carl, any place you want me to go to raise money, I will go.' "). Rather, many Met social activities are likely to revert to its development office, headed by Emily K. Rafferty.
The Met is now returning to a management structure employed by most museums. "The flaw in splitting the job is that nothing is clearly an artistic decision -- it's always a combination of artistic and economic issues," said Richard E. Oldenburg, a former Museum of Modern Art director who is now chairman of Sotheby's North America.
In leaving, Mr. Luers will have to give up that fancy apartment, but he said he would most miss working at the Met and being able to roam the galleries when they are closed to the public. "There's nothing like this place," he said.
Mr. Luers said he had come to the job with a longstanding love particularly of the Old Masters and 19th- century European art. He leaves with broader taste, especially a new appreciation for ancient art.
"Every exhibition here opened my eyes to ancient civilizations," he said. "There are commmon fundamental ideas, and the one thing I've thought of is that I would create a curator of the whole, a department of curators who would spend their time relating the collections to each other. It is fascinating to me how much we can learn from juxtapositions of the way different civilizations have dealt with the same subjects."
On Tuesday, the Met will hold a dinner honoring Mr. Luers, along with Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, the museum's outgoing board chairman and the chairman emeritus of The New York Times Company; James R. Houghton, the incoming chairman, and David E. McKinney, a former I.B.M. executive who is becoming the chief operating officer, with the title of president, reporting to Mr. de Montebello.
In his new position at the United Nations organization beginning on Feb. 1, Mr. Luers returns to his first love, international affairs. It seems revealing that in a recent speech at Hamilton College, his alma mater, he cited as the highlights of his Met career the visits of Vaclav Havel, Andrei K. Sakharov and the Emperor and Empress of Japan.
Showing a trace of emotion in his voice and invoking a custom of the Foreign Service, Mr. Luers said he would return to the Met often to see its displays, but not to attend its parties. "You don't return," he said.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 8, 1999, Friday

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about William H. Luers, the departing president of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, misstated the relationship between his position and that of Philippe de Montebello, the museum's director. The two have been equal, both reporting to the chairman; the director is not subordinate to the president. As the article noted, Mr. de Montebello will assume the additional title of chief executive on Jan. 31.

HEADLINE: Auto Industry Finds Surprises At the End of a Rainbow Year

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 6

 BODY:
Last month was the best for auto sales since December 1986, lifting the industry's sales for 1998 to the highest level in a dozen years despite a nearly eight-week strike last summer from which the General Motors Corporation has not fully recovered.
With the last auto makers reporting their results today, the industry's sales in the United States rose 7.1 percent last month from December 1997. For the year, a total of 15.55 million cars, sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and vans were sold, a 2.8 percent increase from 1997. 
 In 1986, sales soared when the impending expiration of certain tax provisions for auto loans produced a race to dealerships late in the year. By contrast, auto executives at the North American International Auto Show here today offered several reasons for the sales surge last month, which followed brisk sales throughout the autumn. The explanations included the popularity of sport utility vehicles and other light trucks, for which sales rose 10.5 percent last month, as well as high consumer confidence, rising disposable incomes and car prices flat or edging down.
But even while citing these factors, executives seemed a little surprised by how vigorous their business has been. "The market is stronger out there than anyone anticipated," said Robert J. Eaton, co-chairman of DaimlerChrysler A.G., adding that the company might raise its forecast of industry sales this year, from 15.2 million vehicles.
While DaimlerChrysler, the Ford Motor Company, Toyota, Honda and even struggling Nissan all posted big gains last month, G.M. reported a gain of only 3.1 percent as its market share fell to 30.2 percent from 31.3 percent a year earlier. G.M. sales for the entire year tumbled 3.3 percent.
Top G.M. executives at the auto show acknowledged that the company, the world's largest auto maker, had not recovered from the strike, which cost it close to $12 billion in lost production. During the strike the company took a hard line that was based partly on an assessment that sales could not maintain the brisk pace of last spring. The continued strength of sales has left the company's factories unable to catch up.
"We're still short of product, there's no doubt about that, but that gap is beginning to close," said John F. Smith Jr., G.M.'s chairman and chief executive. Roy Roberts, the group vice president for North American sales and marketing, said that G.M. dealerships now have 84 percent of their optimal inventories, barely up from 81 percent at the start of December.
A few pockets of strength showed in G.M.'s figures today. The company's GMC division, which sells premium light trucks such as the GMC Yukon full-size sport utility vehicle, posted a sixth consecutive year of record sales last year as the industry's overall sales of light trucks rose 8.1 percent and car sales fell 1.6 percent.
G.M.'s Saturn division, which plans to introduce a midsize car next summer but remains stuck in the shrinking market for small cars, managed to eke out a surprising 6.4 percent increase. Mark Hogan, the company's vice president for small cars, said the division's showrooms had been busier since Thanksgiving, when it introduced a car that looks like a traditional two-door vehicle but has a small third door that folds open on the driver's side to make it easier to load groceries or briefcases into the back seat.
Mr. Hogan warned that the severe weather of the last week, particularly in the Midwest, might reduce the number of people visiting dealerships. But Mr. Eaton predicted that the robust sales in November and December would spill over into January. Industry sales in December were calculated at a torrid seasonally adjusted annual rate of 17.3 million vehicles, according to Ward's Auto Info Bank, a data service.
Ford reported on Tuesday that its sales climbed last month by 1.2 percent, as a 6.4 percent gain in light- truck sales more than offset a 4.3 percent drop in car sales.

HEADLINE: PRO BASKETBALL: THE SETTLEMENT;
With Little Time on Clock, N.B.A. and Players Settle

BYLINE: By MIKE WISE

 BODY:
National Basketball Association players and owners brought an end to the most calamitous and costly labor dispute in league history yesterday, agreeing to an 11th-hour deal that saved the season only a day before the owners were to vote on canceling it.
Negotiating for 12 hours and trading concessions until 6 A.M. yesterday at the league offices in Manhattan, Commissioner David Stern and Billy Hunter, the union's executive director, worked out a new collective bargaining agreement that ended the six-monthlong impasse. 
 An abbreviated regular season of about 50 games -- there are 82 games in a full season -- was expected to begin in early February, with a full complement of playoffs beginning in early May. The regular season could be extended by one to two weeks, but the playoffs were not expected to last into July and would certainly end before July 4.
The lockout by the owners will not officially end until after the deal is made final by lawyers for both sides and then signed. Training camps and the signing of 200 free agents would then begin, probably around Jan. 18. The games lost this season translate into total player salary losses of about $400 million; leaguewide revenue losses also ran into the hundreds of millions of dollars.
The crux of the disagreement for the past six months has been how to divide the $2 billion in annual revenue that the league generates. Although both sides made some concessions at the end, the league achieved its main goal of containing the contracts of high-salaried players, and received some unprecedented concessions from the union.
It insisted on and received a maximum salary provision, and no other professional sport has a limit on individual salaries.
It also eliminated some of the crippling loopholes to its salary cap that had sent salaries skyrocketing in the last five years.
In the end, the union was left to try to hold onto some of the terms that had provided its players the highest average salary in pro sports, $2.6 million. It also achieved its stated priority of significantly bettering the economic position of its players with mid-level salaries, those making around the median salary of $1.3 million.
The crucial round of discussions began early Tuesday evening and continued through the night at the league offices on Fifth Ave. As they negotiated through the night, snacking on pizza and chocolate, the two sides hammered out the details of an agreement that kept the N.B.A. from becoming the first professional sports league to lose a full season to a labor dispute. Page D4.
The union will receive 55 percent of total revenue toward salaries in the last three years of the deal. That was less than the players had hoped for, and the feeling among many of them was that they had given in to many of the league's demands at the last moment.
Still, it was better than the prospect of no season and many more millions of dollars in lost paychecks. Given that the N.B.A. came perilously close to becoming the first major sports league to lose an entire season to labor strife, many players considered yesterday morning's surprise announcement fortunate.
"I got a call at 6 A.M. in my hotel room this morning and I couldn't believe it," said the free-agent center, Joe Kleine. "We will finally play again. Now we have a bigger job ahead of us: getting our fans back."
Kleine was one of the 184 players who came to Manhattan yesterday for a vote called by the union's negotiating committee. On Monday, Stern had rejected the union's final proposal, and Hunter, succumbing to internal and external pressure to hold a vote on the owners' offer, summoned the players to Manhattan.
Though he said he still considered the owners' offer inadequate, Hunter said he would put the issue before the general membership. It was a risky move that may have led to uneasiness in the union. There was already talk of mounting displeasure among the players, and the fear that a bitter debate among players could further divide the union.
But what was supposed to result in a tense and potentially divisive debate on the union's position instead turned into scenes of relief in and around the GM Building on Fifth Avenue, where the players had gathered at the offices of the union's law firm. Hundreds of reporters and fans mingled inside and outside the buildings, fighting to talk to the players as they exited the building after voting, 179-5, for the deal.
"This is crazy," said Steve Kerr, the Chicago Bulls guard. "I never expected this. Of course, at times I never expected a season, either."
The decisive talks began on Tuesday night after Hunter asked one of the union's outside counsels, Jim Quinn, to go over to the league's offices at 6 P.M. to meet with the deputy commissioner, Russ Granik, and present several concessions to the league.
Quinn and Granik were eventually joined by Stern, Hunter and several other members of the bargaining teams. Negotiating secretly in a conference room at the league's Olympic Tower offices on Fifth Avenue, the two sides gave each other a list of their desires. When they came across a disagreement, Hunter said, they moved on.
In the end, the owners were given the unprecedented concession of a maximum limit on individual salaries. No player with 10 years or more experience can make more than $14 million in the first year of his contract. The figure falls to $11 million for players with less than 10 years experience and $9 million to players with less than six years experience. Gone is the potential for a record $126 million deal over seven years, like the one signed by Minnesota's Kevin Garnett in October 1997.
Under terms of the new agreement, however, a grandfather clause allows any player to re-sign with his team for 105 percent of his previous salary. Michael Jordan, who made more than $33 million last year, could secure a pro-rated deal of $34.7 million from the Chicago Bulls. But he could not make more than $14 million from any other team.
The deal was drawn up for six seasons, with a league option for a seventh year.
Though the union had wanted 56 or 57 percent of revenues to go toward salaries in years four, five and six of the contract, the league held fast at 55 percent. Players would receive 57 percent if the league exercises its option. In the first three years, there is no limit on the percentage of revenues players can receive.
The two sides also stiffened the drug agreement and the player-conduct rules, agreeing to a ban on marijuana. All players will undergo drug testing once per season.
*The union also agreed to a three-year rookie scale with teams holding an option for the fourth year and the right of first refusal in the fifth year. Previously, players became free agents after their third year, but the league pushed for five years, because it was concerned over widespread movement by young players that made it virtually impossible for teams to keep their rosters intact.
*The league accepted the union's proposal for an "average" salary exception and "median" salary exception, with both being phased in during the next three years. As a result, every team will have the right to sign two additional players each season, even if it is over the salary cap.
"Did we blink?" Hunter said. "I guess we both blinked."
With the deal to be made final in less than two weeks and the lockout officially lifted, a flurry of activity is expected as teams make harried attempts to fill rosters while holding training camps. The task will be daunting, but not nearly as arduous as saving the season.
And the damage of this labor dispute could linger. Aside from division among players, the sport will have to recapture a public that polls said was increasingly apathetic about the absence of the game. Major League Baseball suffered a drop in attendance and some resentment from fans following a strike in 1994, and it wasn't until this past season -- with a dramatic home run race and a record-breaking season by the Yankees -- that the sport had fully recovered.
"It's about time," said the Knicks' Terry Cummings. "The fans deserve better. The game is more important than players and owners. Owners pay players to play game, fans pay the salaries for players to play. We can't afford to let something like this happen to our game. Our game is not as old as baseball, and we cant' afford a lapse like baseball did. We have to be concerned about the overall perception of ourselves and our game."

HEADLINE: MOVIE GUIDE

 BODY:

Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film or series. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. An index of reviews of films opening today appears on page 6.
 
Now Playing
 
 * "AFFLICTION," starring Nick Nolte, James Coburn, Willem Dafoe, Sissy Spacek and Mary Beth Hurt. Directed by Paul Schrader (R, 114 minutes). Mr. Nolte is devastating in the performance of his career, as Wade Whitehouse, a New Hampshire loner fighting a losing battle with demons from his past. Foremost among them: Mr. Coburn, terrifyingly authentic as the drunken, abusive father who long ago cowed his sons into submission. As directed by Mr. Schrader, this pure, unfettered adaptation of Russell Banks's novel starts on a deceptively ordinary note, then escalates into inexorable fury. Every little detail matters. Ms. Spacek and Ms. Hurt expertly play the women who trigger Wade's crisis (Janet Maslin).
 
 * "A BUG'S LIFE," featuring the voices of Dave Foley, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Kevin Spacey. Directed by John Lasseter and Andrew Stanton (G, 94 minutes). The best animated ant-colony movie of the year. And this is a more clearly defined family film than the verbally adult "Antz." With the same anthropomorphism that gave Mr. Lasseter's "Toy Story" so much spark, this pastel-hued, visually ingenious feat of animation tells a tale of ant courage while incorporating lively wit and an enchanting sense of nature. And it's a showcase for the incredible range of facial expressions that make this type of animation more and more invitingly lifelike all the time (Maslin).
 
 * "CENTRAL STATION," starring Fernanda Montenegro, Vinicius de Oliveira and Marilia Pera. Directed by Walter Salles (R, 115 minutes). In this quiet, luminous Brazilian gem, a joyless older woman crosses paths with an orphaned young boy. There's plenty of room for sentimentality here, but the wonder of Mr. Salles's film is all in the telling. As these characters develop a fractious bond, then embark on a road trip that takes them vividly to Brazil's hinterlands in search of the boy's father, Mr. Salles brings great tenderness and surprise to the events that punctuate their journey. Ms. Montenegro's tough bravura performance was one of 1998's very best (Maslin).
 
 * "A CIVIL ACTION," starring John Travolta, Robert Duvall and William H. Macy. Directed by Steven Zaillian (PG-13, 120 minutes). This story of a David-Goliath lawsuit against industrial polluters, with Mr. Travolta first rate as an ambulance chaser who develops a conscience, could have been business as usual in the legal thriller genre. But Mr. Zaillian's keenly observed, beautifully acted film, based on Jonathan Harr's nonfiction best seller about a case in Woburn, Mass., doesn't follow familiar formulas. It follows all the surprises and frustrations of a story that was never black and white, and is all the better for its shades of gray. Mr. Duvall is outstanding as a corporate lawyer full of wily tricks (Maslin).
 
 "ELIZABETH," starring Cate Blanchett, Joseph Fiennes, Geoffrey Rush and Christopher Eccleston. Directed by Shekhar Kapur (R, 124 minutes). In this lurid costume drama depicting Elizabeth I as a royal rookie, the impressive Ms. Blanchett plays the Queen as if her principal responsibilities were being bejeweled, selecting consorts and saying "Leave us!" with a wave of the hand. For all its putative concern with Roman Catholic-Protestant strife at the start of Elizabeth's reign, this is historical drama for those whose idea of history is back issues of Vogue. Intent on spectacle, complete with burning at the stake and one dance scene reminiscent of "Saturday Night Fever," it winds up imagining the Queen as a glamorously stressed-out modern woman afflicted by a super-intense case of having it all (Maslin).
 
 "THE FACULTY," starring Jordana Brewster, Clea DuVall, Laura Harris and Josh Hartnett. Directed by Robert Rodriguez (R, 111 minutes). Like Frankenstein, "The Faculty" plunders the crypts of cinema for its body parts. Here are the paranoia and parasitism of "Invasion of the Body Snatchers." There are the slimy, sharp-toothed creatures of "Alien." And over there are the movie-wise teen-agers of "Scream." The list could be extended, but the point is clear: This mediocre sci-fi horror film about an Ohio high school being taken over by thirsty space aliens intent on world domination breaks no new ground. But the movie, written by Kevin Williamson, has an engaging cast, with half a dozen appealing young actors playing the roles of teen-agers who are all that stand between the Midwestern monsters and the end of the world as certain moviegoers know it (Lawrence Van Gelder).
 
 * "THE GENERAL," starring Brendan Gleeson and Jon Voight. Directed by John Boorman (not rated, 125 minutes). Mr. Boorman's best and most stylish film in years is the deftly told story of Martin Cahill. Nicknamed "the General" for his crime-plotting strategies, this Irish gang leader and master thief is played with splendid brio by Mr. Gleeson. Photographed gorgeously in black and white, the film tells of his elaborate art and jewel heists, his unusual domestic arrangement with his wife's sister and his singular difficulties with the I.R.A. and the law. Mr. Voight is outstandingly good as the police detective who knows all of Cahill's tricks (Maslin).
 
 * "GODS AND MONSTERS," starring Ian McKellen and Brendan Fraser. Directed by Bill Condon (not rated, 105 minutes). In a performance that well deserves to be remembered at Academy Award time, Mr. McKellen becomes the deliciously urbane James Whale, depicting the gay "Frankenstein" director late in life. Shaken by the aftereffects of a mild stroke, this Whale finds his past coming back to greet him just as the present offers new fascination in the Adonis-like form of the gardener (Mr. Fraser, also fine), whom Whale finds mowing his lawn. This beautifully acted, witty and heart-tugging film, from a Christopher Bram book, imagines what Whale's final days might have been like while shaping a splendid character study and a droll portrait of closeted gay Hollywood. Lynn Redgrave provides ballast and comic relief as Whale's perpetually scandalized housekeeper (Maslin).
 
 * "HILARY AND JACKIE," starring Emily Watson and Rachel Griffiths. Directed by Anand Tucker (R, 121 minutes). The parallel biographies of the brilliant cellist Jacqueline du Pre (Ms. Watson), who contracted multiple sclerosis at the height of her career, and her slightly older sister, Jackie (Ms. Griffiths), a talented flutist who gave up a professional career to marry and be "ordinary," is one of the most insightful studies of sibling rivalry ever filmed. Jacqueline may have won fame and glory, the movie says, but she remained a desperately needy emotional child who had to have everything Hilary had (including Hilary's husband). The film is structured like a concerto, in three movements, the last of which ends with Jackie's harrowing death in her sister's arms. The drama is deepened by a soundtrack that makes expert use of Jacqueline's signature piece, the Elgar Cello Concerto in E minor. Ms. Watson's Jacqueline flames with an almost scary intensity (Stephen Holden).
 
 "THE HI-LO COUNTRY," starring Billy Crudup, Woody Harrelson, Sam Elliott and Patricia Arquette. Directed by Stephen Frears (R, 114 minutes). Mr. Frears, the British director, makes a bold but unsteady leap into classic western territory with this story of a friendship between two cowboys who go into the cattle business together after returning from World War II. Mr. Crudup is the shy, laconic Pete, who secretly covets the married girlfriend of his idol, Big Boy (Mr. Harrelson). A movie that wants to be a hybrid of "Giant," "Red River" and "The Last Picture Show" loses its bearings and becomes a laborious soap opera whose red-headed bad girl (Ms. Arquette) lacks the magnetism to make the drama sizzle. But Mr. Harrelson is a live wire as the rootin'-tootin' last of a breed (Holden).
 
 * "HURLYBURLY," starring Sean Penn, Kevin Spacey, Robin Wright Penn, Chazz Palminteri, Garry Shandling, Anna Paquin and Meg Ryan, Directed by Anthony Drazan (R, 122 minutes). David Rabe's screen adaptation of his 80's play about macho mind games in a cocaine-infested Hollywood is a nasty but powerful piece of work made all the more disturbing by the film's close-up view of its troubled characters. Mr. Penn as Eddie, a Hollywood casting director on the skids, eviscerates himself in a stunning performance full of tears, snarls and dripping nostrils. Mr. Spacey, as Eddie's slick, ruthless housemate Mickey, is appropriately reptilian, and Mr. Palminteri and Mr. Shandling are creepily convincing as two of their friends. Ms. Penn, Ms. Paquin and Ms. Ryan are the women they abuse and pass around like trading cards. The movie, like the play, isn't so much about sex as it is about the male incapacity for genuinely selfless friendship (Holden).
 
 * "LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL," directed by and starring Roberto Benigni (PG-13, 122 minutes). Italy's most antic funnyman dares to find humor and tenderness in the midst of the Holocaust, and his risk pays off. This Cannes prize winner is as stubbornly entertaining as its central character, a Jewish waiter named Guido who jokes his way through the nightmare for the sake of his loved ones. Daring also to combine an opening hour of romance and pranks with a more somber second act, Mr. Benigni avoids all traces of the maudlin and effectively creates a situation in which comedy is courage. In this unpretentious, enormously likable film, he shines as a father whose fibs and hilarious buffoonery know no bounds, and no fear (Maslin).
 
 "PATCH ADAMS," starring Robin Williams and Monica Potter. Directed by Tom Shadyac (PG-13, 110 minutes). As a maverick doctor intent on making terminal patients laugh, Mr. Williams delivers a little clowning and a lot of maudlin feel-good sentiment, along with vulgarity left over from the filmmaker's "Ace Ventura" days. He also spends a lot of time being congratulated for his good works, as the film's minor players are kept busy marveling at his antics. The real-life story of this doctor may sound like a fine occasion for Mr. Williams to cut loose, but the film version proves narrow and predictable. Ms. Potter, with a nostrilly resemblance to Julia Roberts, figures in a romantic subplot with a bizarre twist (Maslin).
 
 * "THE PRINCE OF EGYPT," starring the voices of Val Kilmer, Ralph Fiennes, Sandra Bullock and Michelle Pfeiffer. Directed by Brenda Chapman, Steve Hickner and Simon Wells (PG, 93 minutes). First came the great expectations for this animated magnum opus from Dreamworks. Then came reality, in a film struggling mightily to balance animated whimsy and biblical stature. The upshot is an admirably worthy rendering of the Exodus story, even if Moses must initially be seen as a playful young scamp. Biblical plagues and miracles serve as special inspiration for the animators' reality-bending ingenuity (Maslin).
 
 "THE RUGRATS MOVIE," starring the voices of E. G. Daily, Christine Cavanaugh, Kath Soucie, Tara Charendoff and Tim Curry. Directed by Norton Virgien and Igor Kovalyov (G, 90 minutes). Dil Pickles is not the first baby whose resentful older sibling wanted to return him to the hospital, but he's probably the only one who has such an interesting trip back. Dil (full name: Dylan Preston Pickles) is the newborn hero of the first film starring the five talking babies of Nickelodeon's hit children's series "Rugrats." The pleasant surprise is that the film is a delight, from encounters with wolves, wizards and circus monkeys in the forest to musical numbers at the "baby store." There's material for grown-up moviegoers, too, including a scene with some pathetic reporters who turn up at the Pickles house when the children disappear, getting everybody's name wrong and asking, "Is it true a dingo ate your baby?" (Anita Gates).
 
 * "SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE," starring Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth Paltrow, Geoffrey Rush, Ben Affleck and Judi Dench. Directed by John Madden (R, 113 minutes). A witty, sexy and merrily literate delight, with an exhilaratingly clever premise that only gets better as the film unfolds. The screenplay, originating as Marc Norman's brainstorm and turned by Tom Stoppard into razor-sharp dialogue reminiscent of his "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead," dares to imagine whatever it likes about the link between Shakespeare's artistic passions and his mad yearning for a certain aristocratic beauty. Meanwhile this tirelessly inventive comedy also envisions an Elizabethan theater fraught with the same backbiting and conniving we enjoy today, and has great fun presenting the creation of "Romeo and Juliet," glitches and all. Mr. Fiennes and Ms. Paltrow make a fine, tempestuous duo, and she gives the first great, fully realized starring performance of her career (Maslin).
 
 * "A SIMPLE PLAN," starring Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton and Bridget Fonda. Directed by Sam Raimi (R, 120 minutes). This onetime cult horror director makes a flawless transition to mainstream storytelling with a quietly devastating thriller. And its fine cast plays out the consequences of a harmless-sounding error in judgment that winds up leveling everything in its path. The catalyst is $4.4 million that literally falls out of the sky, and Scott Smith's story proves how deadly the morality of expediency can become. When you get the shivers watching this wintry tale, which features an especially memorable performance from Mr. Thornton, it won't be from the cold (Maslin).
 
 "STAR TREK: INSURRECTION," starring Patrick Stewart, Jonathan Frakes and Brent Spiner. Directed by Mr. Frakes (PG, 105 minutes). The latest movie episode of the series that will not die finds Captain Picard (Mr. Stewart) and the crew of the Enterprise saving a tribe of utopian space pioneers who live on a planet where everyone enjoys eternal youth. The bad guys want to relocate the people forcibly and exploit the planet's life-giving properties. Picard, standing up against the admiral of Starfleet and risking court-martial, delivers impassioned speeches about the ugly history of forcible relocation and also falls in love with a 309-year-old beauty (Donna Murphy). Although in its ninth movie episode, the series has retained its sincerity and multicultural right-mindedness. It's hokum, but executed deftly and with a warm heart (Holden).
 
 "STEPMOM," starring Susan Sarandon, Julia Roberts and Ed Harris. Directed by Chris Columbus (PG-13, 120 minutes). A man's ex-wife and new girlfriend lock horns over who can be nicer to his two children, in a sudsy story made livelier by its two female stars, both in appealingly high gear. Ms. Roberts plays the nicest person ever to wear black to a downtown photo shoot, while the especially fiery Ms. Sarandon plays the suburban mother as mama lion. Even when the prospect of mortality looms, the story manages to maintain its big, lavish look and peculiar (under the circumstances) sense of fun. As in "Home Alone," Mr. Columbus directs with sunny indifference to reality, medical, economic or otherwise (Maslin).
 
 "THE THIN RED LINE," starring Jim Caviezel, Ben Chaplin, Nick Nolte and Sean Penn, and Woody Harrelson. Directed by Terrence Malick (R, 166 minutes). From the first frame of this huge, drifting war epic loosely derived from James Jones's Guadalcanal novel, it's viscerally clear that Mr. Malick is back. The exquisite, oddly detached visual style that made "Badlands" and "Days of Heaven" the most beautiful films of the 1970's is instantly apparent here, even if the narrative vagueness and brooding voice-overs are also familiar. The film sprawls, gets lost and occasionally delivers visual poetry, the kind that could have been greatly helped by tighter editing. Bottom line: no one who admired Mr. Malick's early work should miss this. But those expecting anything simple will not find it here (Maslin).
 
 * "TOUCH OF EVIL," starring Orson Welles, Charlton Heston and Janet Leigh. Directed by Welles (not rated, 108 minutes). Anyone familiar with Welles's 1958 film-noir landmark knows that it could just as well have been called "Truckload of Evil," and that its crazily sinister plot turns and breathtaking camera work remain astonishingly fresh. "Touch of Evil" is, among so many things, the other film to find Janet Leigh at a lonely motel under strangely menacing management, and the one in which Welles gave one of his most droll, swaggering performances as a corrupt police captain in an American town on the Mexican border. As visually thrilling as it is sin-soaked, this artfully reconstructed version of "Touch of Evil" remains one of the brightest lights on the cinematic landscape this season (Maslin).
 
 * "WAKING NED DEVINE," starring Ian Bannen, David Kelly and Fionnula Flanagan. Directed by Kirk Jones (PG, 91 minutes). Delightful shenanigans greet the news of a winning lottery ticket in a tiny Irish village. Especially after the winner turns out to be dead. Mr. Bannen and Mr. Kelly are wonderfully funny as two old coots who concoct a plot to claim the winnings and unite the town's cast of hearty characters in the process. Mr. Jones's prize-winning career directing television commercials means that everyone here is an amusing eccentric with colorful quirks, and that the septuagenarian stars' naked motorcycle-riding scenes are played for all they're worth. This comedy doesn't have the tart edge of "The Full Monty," but it knows how to coax laughs from making a spectacle of elderly gentlemen in the buff (Maslin).
 
 * "YOU'VE GOT MAIL," starring Meg Ryan, Tom Hanks, Greg Kinnear and Parker Posey. Directed by Nora Ephron (PG, 110 minutes). This cozy, inviting comedy romanticizes the rivalry between two bookstore owners, while also finding time to fall in love with books themselves, the instant intimacy of E-mail and a picture-perfect rendering of Manhattan's Upper West Side. With a feel-good ambiance much less forced than that of "Sleepless in Seattle," Ms. Ephron borrows adroitly from "The Shop Around the Corner" while making this knowing, urbanely funny film very much her own. Ms. Ryan is fresh and adorable without trying, while a ruefully lovelorn Mr. Hanks proves that he can do anything. Again (Maslin).

Steel Dreams That the Eye Can Cherish

BYLINE: By HERBERT MUSCHAMP 

 BODY:
People often complain that buildings seldom look as good as the renderings artists make of them. But whose fault is that? The truth is that few people are born with sharp eyes. When vision is not cultivated by memory, shock and enthusiasm, the world can look remarkably dull.
Eye-training class is now in session at the Museum of the City of New York, where a trio of shows offer startlingly different ways of looking at the evolution of 20th-century New York. All three shows focus on building as both noun and verb. They depict buildings and building: the process and the artifacts in the making of the modern metropolis. Collectively, the three shows demonstrate that looking is itself an architectural act. A city is constructed daily by the glancing perception of its parts. 
 Two of the shows seduce us into subliminally intimate relationships between consenting adults and our magnificent city. "New York Horizontal" features panoramic views taken by William Hassler, a commercial photographer who captured sweeping images of the city in the years just before and after World War I. "New York Vertical" presents large-format versions of photographs by Horst Hamann, a photographer who had the happy inspiration to turn a panorama camera on its side and train it on slender fragments of the Manhattan skyline.
The third exhibition, "New York on the Rise," features glamour portraits: images of early skyscrapers painted by Hughson Hawley, the most sought-after renderer in the United States from the turn of the century to the advent of the Great Depression.
The combination of the shows gives each an added richness, but some may find Hawley's the most vibrant work on view. Born in England in 1850, he first worked as a scenic designer for the stage, and his renderings have a theatrical glamour that largely stems from his depiction of light.
Typically, he sets his buildings against skies divided into horizontal bands of mottled clouds, intense blue and luminous white. Building facades are streaked with cloud shadows. These effects bring to mind Fitzgerald's description of New York in the 1920's as a city that had all the iridescence of the beginning of the world.
It is a new world that we see taking shape in Hawley's renderings: a continent that, thanks in great part to New York's exploding skyline, has begun to cast off its sense of cultural inferiority to Europe and grow into its own strength. Buildings like the Woolworth Building and the Singer Tower provided the scenic backdrop against which Paul Rosenfeld, in his groundbreaking 1925 book "Port of New York," declared that the city had ceased to be a city artists wished to flee and had instead become their major destination.
"Come back, come back, O glittering and white!" The Hawley show offers ample opportunity to echo Fitzgerald's lament for the lost city of his early years. The artist's huge, rosy rendering of the original Waldorf-Astoria Hotel is enough to make you loathe the Empire State Building, which now occupies the fabled hotel's site. A masterwork of Henry Hardenbergh, who also designed the Plaza and Chelsea Hotels and the Dakota apartments, this palace for the people stood for just over 30 years before it was torn down.
No one needs additional reason to dislike 1515 Broadway, the fin-topped office building between 44th and 45th Streets that replaced the legendary Astor Hotel. But Hawley's rendering of the Astor helps to explain why this vanished landmark helped to anchor Times Square in a way that the Marriott Marquis, for example, does not. The Astor sits squarely on the street, throws open its grand doors to it and enlivens the sidewalk with the tall arched windows of its ground-floor public rooms. Had the place been allowed to stand for 20 more years, Ian Schrager would probably now be fitting its windows with billowing white curtains.
But the masterpiece in the Hawley show is his rendering of a building that still stands: Cass Gilbert's Broadway Chambers Building just east of City Hall. This speculative office building was Gilbert's first New York commission, and it's not an exaggeration to regard it as the Lever House of its day, a building that was widely regarded as the ultimate refinement of the early skyscraper type. When models and drawings of the building were presented at the Paris Exposition of 1900, Europeans rubbed their eyes. Here was an eminently refined version of a building type made possible by elevators, ingenuity, steel and greed.
Yet many people now pass by this building daily without giving it a glance. The ground floor houses a costume-jewelry shop, but the building itself is as beautiful as ever, though now it's we who must rub our eyes to see it. The fading of alertness can be a more tragic loss than the demolition of a building. Disenchantment is the heavy price we pay for novelty.
Hassler's panoramic views in "New York Horizontal" bring to mind the children's game of moving statues. (Stop. Don't Stop.) The pictures, up to four feet long, were taken with a No. 8 Cirkut Outfit camera, which came equipped with a rotating body capable of producing 360-degree views. With some of them, the effect is of a person whirling around, arms outstretched, as if to possess the city by sheer exuberance.
Possession, in fact, was Hassler's stock in trade. He worked for real estate developers, most often for Joseph D. Day, and a number of Hassler's pictures were made on assignment to document sites for future development. His panoramas deserve to stand with the paintings of Church and Burchfield as enticements for people to settle in Arcadian settings that their settlements will ruin.
"New York Vertical" is a blown-up, walk-through version of Mr. Hamann's excellent book of that same title. Unfortunately, his black-and-white photographs do not gain from being removed from their binding and enlarged to many times their size.
The problem here is scale. The book establishes a tactile immediacy between the city and the body. It supports the illusion that you hold the city in your hands. Your eye takes in each image with a single scan. The blown-up versions, though handsomely installed, negate the intimacy between image and viewer and leave an unfortunate impression of trade-show hyperbole. But groups of them would do wonders for subway platforms.
Mr. Hamann used a Linhof Technorama, a panoramic camera that makes exceptional demands on the photographer's vision because the format does not permit the framing that draws on the vision of the complete image.
Spring for the book. Mr. Hamann is a genius at composition, not only in his framing of architectural forms but in his treatment of light as well. His gradations of gray, the deluxe velvet of his blacks, combined with the unexpected angles from which he often shoots, bring an oddly abstract quality to these sharply focused renderings of urban texture.
Only a few of Mr. Hamann's pictures include people, and these figures tend to appear solitary, isolated, as if weighted down by the enormous volume of space pressing from above. Montgomery Schuyler once described the skyscrapers of lower Manhattan conversing among themselves at their summits like a race of giants. Mr. Hamann's pictures show what it's like to stand in the middle of the conversation without the elevation to make yourself heard. But I have a feeling that our lowly gossip is juicier than theirs.
In Plato's ideal city, the height of buildings was to be determined by strength of voice. A person standing in the street should be able to understand what someone standing atop a building is shouting. So how did it happen that in the world's most democratic city, we hear nothing but fire engines, ambulances, police cars and jackhammers raising the skyline to ever more improbable heights?
Telephones had much to do with it, and in 1882 Hawley prepared a stunning rendering of what was then the new New York Stock Exchange, a small classical temple festooned with telephone wires. It's an uncharacteristic drawing, created for publication in the rotogravure. With its sculptural massing and severe coloration, the rendering points in the direction of Leger. But now, at a time when the Stock Exchange is demanding larger quarters, it's evident that Hawley foresaw what Manuel Castels would later call the space of flows -- the displacement of architecture by the communications technology that now keeps the global economy humming round the clock.
An aura of melancholy permeates these three shows: the sensation that artists who relate best to buildings have difficulty engaging with people. In no way am I suggesting that these three artists have flawed characters. I mean, rather, that their work discloses an essential truth about the art form they record.
Architecture is a social art. It brings people together in space. But these images remind us that architecture originated as a means of reckoning with mortality. In an era of festival marketplaces, convention hotels and overly calculated ho-ho-ho, it is useful to recall that the history of architecture leads fantastically back toward death.

Inside-Out Meditations On the Poison of Racism

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER 

 BODY:
The subject of race has prompted some of the most mettlesome American art in the 1990's. And much of that work owes a debt to Adrian Piper, an artist who helped introduce identity politics into Conceptualism nearly 30 years ago.
Ms. Piper, 50, came to the theme as both insider and outsider. A light-skinned black woman from a middle-class background, she was raised in Harlem but educated in private integrated schools. She is usually taken for white in social encounters, and this "passing" status has been the springboard for much of her art. 
 From this vantage, she has experienced racism firsthand: she remembers being regarded with suspicion by other black children as a child, and later by white adults when she had made her background clear. Her response has been to explore the peculiar dynamic of the in-between.
In her art she plays the dual role of cultural eavesdropper and provocateur. And she has tenaciously prodded and dissected the concept of race itself to suggest its contradictory guises, whether as a pretext for economic oppression, as a source of psychological challenge or as a resistant, divisive fact of everyday life.
Two traveling retrospectives of Ms. Piper's career are to appear later this year, one in March at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago, the other in October at the University of Maryland in Baltimore. But a compact mini-survey of some of her earliest and most prescient work can be seen now at Thomas Erben Gallery in SoHo.
Under the umbrella title "Mythic Being: 1972-1975," the show brings together a group of hand-altered black-and-white self-portrait photographs that represent a breakthrough moment for the artist.
In the 1960's, after attending the School of Visual Arts, she was producing and exhibiting abstract Conceptual work, inspired in part by the example of Sol LeWitt. It was only in 1970, when she was studying at City College, that she seems to have made an emotional connection to the black power movement, which led to a change of direction in her art.
This produced a series of politically charged performance pieces, staged in private and in public and documented in photographs, in which she played the central role. Disguising herself in dark glasses, a spectacular Afro wig and a handlebar mustache -- a kind of 70's version of blackface -- she created an alter ego as a young, working-class black or Latino man.
To the earliest shots of herself in male drag she added cartoon-style speech balloons filled with quotations from diaries she had been keeping since she was in her teens. She then paid to have the pictures published among the advertisements in the art pages of The Village Voice.
The images, with their scrambling of race and gender, are hilarious and weird. The Mythic Being seems to be visually based on the day's icons of racial militancy, like the Black Panthers and Angela Davis. But the chatty diary entries, which include breathless reports of adolescent crushes, diffuse any sense of macho threat and underscore the androgynous nature of the performance.
The work toughens up in the 10-part series "I/You (Her)" from 1974. Here her face is joined by the collaged face of another woman, a white friend with whom she had quarreled. The harsh, bitter words Ms. Piper assigns herself announce the end of the friendship and imply that racism was a factor in the estrangement. Significantly, she gradually transforms her face (with the help of a felt-tip pen) into that of the Mythic Being as the piece progresses.
Thereafter, race became the main focus of the work. In 1975, while a graduate student in philosophy at Harvard, Ms. Piper took her performances into the street and had herself photographed in male guise "cruising" white women in Harvard Square, staging a fake mugging in a nearby park, and walking through crowds of unheeding pedestrians thinking murderous thoughts and itching for a fight.
The pictures suggest a certain style of 1960's guerrilla theater that blended klutzy absurdist humor and goading ideological contempt. Its flavor is perhaps best distilled in a single 1975 photo piece in which the Mythic Being, seen in dramatically shadowed close-up, seems to exhale the words "I embody everything you most hate and fear," written in a puff of cigarette smoke.
By this point, artist and alter ego had effectively merged. In the later images in the show, the Mythic Being sits at a typewriter surrounded by quotes from Immanuel Kant, the subject of Ms. Piper's dissertation. (She now teaches philosophy at Wellesley College.) Her use of blackface -- as a means both to distance herself from and to claim a racial identity -- had, one suspects, served its psychic purpose.
Much has happened in art and in politics since 1975, though certain things remain little changed. Racism, despite some contrary signals, just won't let go, inside or outside the art world. Surely that's why Ms. Piper's work from the early 70's makes almost as much sense now as it did then, and why her link to younger artists seems so evident and immediate. The "Mythic Being" series anticipates much contemporary art, from the text-intensive paintings of Glenn Ligon, to the emblematic photographs of Lorna Simpson, to the smart, sharp cross-gender work of Lyle Ashton-Harris. And it clearly has a place in the current, often rancorous debate on use (or misuse) of black stereotypes in art.
Such questions of precedence and influence will be easier to evaluate when the retrospectives appear. But much of what makes Ms. Piper an important figure can be found in bud in the Erben show. It reveals an artist who has been from the start a witty and aggressive controversialist, one who believes that art can be an effective vehicle for ideas, and that ideas can spark self-examination and social change.
 
"Adrian Piper: The Mythic Being, 1972-75" remains at Thomas Erben Gallery, 476 Broome Street, SoHo, through Jan. 16.

HEADLINE: ANTIQUES;
Much More Than Meets The Eye

BYLINE: By Wendy Moonan 

 BODY:
In Modernism, form is supposed to follow function. In antiques, form often hides function, which is much more fun.
This year some dealers at the 45th annual Winter Antiques Show, which opens on Jan. 15 at the Seventh Regiment Armory, on Park Avenue and 66th Street, will be selling rare examples of metamorphic furniture, pieces with two distinct functions, one of which is usually disguised in the other. For example, the Manhattan gallery L'Antiquaire and the Connoisseur Inc. will be exhibiting a 34-inch-wide "tavolo-scrivania" made in Venice around 1760. It is a card table that turns into a desk when you push the top of the table back and pull the next layer forward; a reading stand pops up, with inkwells on the side and drawers underneath. 
 "Mechanical tables were extremely rare then, especially ones made in Venice this early," said Helen Fioratti, president of the gallery. "You have to remember, this is the century of charm and amusement. Think of Casanova. This table is a fine example of the kind of things that interested people then."
The table is walnut, with cabriole legs. The top is inlaid with marquetry fruitwood and bone, depicting the Three Graces. It costs $105,000.
The table is not much smaller than a famous metamorphic desk made in Italy for Napoleon's sister, Elisa Bonaparte, which is now at Fontainebleau. Elisa was the Hillary Clinton of her day: intelligent, educated and strong willed. Madeleine Deschamps, a furniture expert, wrote in her book "Empire" (Abbeville, 1994) that after Elisa married Felix Bacciochi, a Corsican officer, Napoleon made her Princess of Lucca. Later she became Grand Duchess of Tuscany, and, Ms. Deschamps wrote, "she showed much interest in the economic development of both those states, energetically improving the legislation and administration as well as the hospital system."
The London craftsman David Linley discussed Elisa's desk in his book "Extraordinary Furniture" (Reed Books, 1996). He wrote that the desk was designed by Giovanni Socci of Florence (1807-39), a leading cabinetmaker of the Empire style, to look like a plain oval mahogany commode with saber legs and a marble top. In fact, the "drawers" on the front are the back of a chair. When they are drawn back, out comes a three-legged chair.
Viscount Linley wrote: "When the chair is pulled out, the central leg has to slide through a groove in the main central platform, and so is of a simpler turned shape than the other two. The marble top is made in two halves, which part to reveal a leather-covered writing slope and a small writing box that pops up and takes stationery, ink and pens."
Elisa liked the desk so much that she took it with her into exile after the fall of Napoleon. Her daughter Napoleone inherited it, as did Napoleon III later on, and it finally became part of the French National Collections.
Dual-purpose furniture probably started in ancient times, when someone created a table by placing a board on two sawhorses. In the Middle Ages and through the 17th century, the English made oak chair-tables, sometimes called monk's chairs. In these pieces, the armchair back pivots so that it can be lowered to become a table.
Metamorphic furniture became particularly fashionable in England during the Regency period (1805-25). At the armory show, the Kentshire Galleries, a Manhattan dealer in English antiques, is selling, for $24,000, a mahogany library chair, circa 1815, with scrolled arms, a leaf-carved back splat with a lion's mask, and an ebonized crest rail. The chair back tilts backward on hinges to become a set of library steps.
"Most pieces of dual-function furniture were commissioned for private libraries," said Robert I. Ballinger, the manager of the Philadelphia antiques shop Alfred Bullard Inc., another exhibitor at the armory show. "Books were rare. After Englishmen went on their grand tour, they built libraries to showcase their knowledge and wealth. With the advent of the library came the ladder chair, the ladder stool and ladder pole: all means to reach the upper tiers of the bookcases."
Metamorphic furniture was also meant to be fun. "These were toys for rich men," Mr. Ballinger said. "They were costly when they were made. They were always of the finest materials and craftsmanship, because only the rich had libraries. I have never seen a library chair in a secondary wood or done with second-rate craftsmanship."
Bruce Newman, owner of Newel Art Galleries, a Manhattan to-the-trade dealer that is not in the armory show, said he had several metamorphic antiques in stock, including two revolving bookcases, 27 inches square, that can be used as lecterns, and a pair of what he called "pote" tables, 19th-century hollow mahogany fluted columns that can be used as pedestals or opened up for storage. The pair costs $12,000.
Mr. Newman also said he had a Regency library table with a top that folded up and becomes a ladder and a pole you can hold on to as you mount the steps. This costs $60,000. He said these and some 20,000 other items can be seen at his Web site, www.newel.com.
Sotheby's New York has a sale of English furniture on Jan. 22 that includes a William IV library table-steps with gilt-tooled leather inset steps (estimate: $12,000 to $15,000) and a brass-bound and leather-covered library pole-ladder (estimate: $3,000 to $5,000).
The French were masters at hybrid furniture designs. Dalva Brothers, a Manhattan gallery that specializes in French antiques, has several, including a rare bonheur-du-jour, a lady's writing desk ingeniously fitted with compartments, that has been owned by an array of Americans (Joseph C. Widener, John L. Severence, the Cleveland Museum and John Dorrance, the founder of Campbell's Soup).
The desk, by the leading Paris cabinetmaker Pierre Rousel, is Transitional Period, between Louis XV and XVI. It starts as a writing table with a hinged central panel that lifts backward. A mirror flips up, and the piece becomes a poudreuse, or dressing table. It compresses a lot of storage areas into a minimal space, while remaining quintessentially feminine. It costs $350,000.
Apartment dwellers who can't afford a guest room will like the 18th-century beds hidden in pieces of furniture. "Beds in the form of bookcases, writing desks, cupboards and sideboards were probably found in many well-to-do homes," Viscount Linley wrote in his book. "The inventory made of Madame de Pompadour's possessions mentions three."
His favorite is a commode bed designed about 1780 by the Swedish cabinetmaker Georg Haupt. The entire front slides out from the back, extending like a telescope. Folding legs swing down to support the mattress, which is rolled up inside. The bed was made for the private bedroom of Gustavus III of Sweden, as a place for his page-bodyguard to sleep. The King was assassinated anyway, in 1792, but at least it wasn't in his bedroom. Come to think of it, that commode bed could be useful in a lot of situations.

A Loving Home Life, Right Down to the Nits

BYLINE: By GRACE GLUECK 

 BODY:
A mother delousing her child's hair may not be the most appealing subject, but the Dutch painter Pieter de Hooch (1629-1684) saw it as a labor of love. In "A Mother and Child With Its Head in Her Lap" (1658-60) he conjures up a convincing scene of domestic felicity.
The subject is not unfamiliar in Dutch painting; combs and hair-cleaning symbolized godliness, and earlier artists had depicted delousing scenes. But de Hooch (pronounced de-HOAK) brought it home, so to speak, creating a "real" setting carefully anchored in specifics. A well-dressed mother dexterously plows her kneeling child's scalp in a room whose properties are seen in exquisite detail, from beamed ceiling to mellow tiled floor. 
 Sunlight pours through a doorway leading to a smaller chamber, whose open window presents an outdoor view. The light casts a precise pattern on the floor between the doorway and the window. Also coming from a high window at right, it brings alive the texture of the striped bed curtains flanked by a brass bed warmer on the wall beside them. A small pooch (pronounced POOCH) -- dogs are a staple of de Hooch paintings -- is silhouetted in the doorway.
The scene is, in short, a cozy one in which the intimate details of domestic life and the play of light and color on surfaces and textures give the viewer the sense of a comfortable, nonthreatening world in which all is as it should be. Like the best of de Hooch's Delft period, the painting conveys the solid values of prosperous Dutch burgherhood: tidiness, both moral and physical; tranquillity and, not least important, parental skills. Perhaps, too, the aftermath of the Thirty Years' War (1618-48), in which the Netherlands was engaged, encouraged an audience for an art of peace and domestic harmony.
De Hooch did not invent genre painting, but he literally gave it a new dimension. Space and perspective played roles as charged as color in his work; one of his favorite devices is that of a dark foreground with an open door leading into a brightly lighted second space that in turn reveals another view. Although skilled in the use of mathematical perspective, he was also adept at creating a sense of it by the time-honored use of color, light and atmospheric effects. Small wonder that he was considered a star of the Delft School, outshone only by his contemporary Johannes Vermeer (1632-75).
Yet the show at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, simply titled "Pieter de Hooch, 1629-84," is the first retrospective ever given to this masterly recorder of everyday life. It was organized by Desmond Shawe-Taylor, director of the Dulwich Picture Gallery in London, and Peter C. Sutton, director of the Wadsworth Atheneum, a de Hooch scholar who produced the catalogue raisonne of his work in 1980. In 40 or so paintings, the artist's development is tracked from early renditions of soldiers disporting in taverns and guard rooms through the atmospheric interiors and courtyards of his Delft period to the elegant but stilted and sometimes bizarre canvases he turned out after moving to Amsterdam. But the work done in Delft is far and away the best.
De Hooch's biography is short on facts, long on supposition. He was born in Rotterdam, the son of a bricklayer and a professional midwife. He probably studied in Haarlem with the Italianate landscape painter Nicolaes Berchem (1620-83), was married and left in 1652 for Delft, where he seems to have worked as both a painter and a servant for a linen merchant. In 1655 he joined the artists' guild there (which Vermeer later led), moved to Amsterdam between 1660-61 and died in a madhouse at the age of 55.
Nothing is known about his relationship with Vermeer, with whose work his own shared many traits. Even scholars are hard put to say who influenced whom; occasionally they have had trouble telling their works apart. The two artists were in Delft at the same time, but whether they knew each other is not certain. Yet they must have been aware of each other's paintings. If de Hooch's palette is warmer than Vermeer's and he uses more complex perspective systems and multiple sources of light, Vermeer's subjects are more subtly portrayed, compositionally more harmonious and convey a sense of enigma foreign to de Hooch's straight-on approach.
De Hooch started out in a cliched Dutch genre tradition, doing scenes of soldiers and peasants carousing in barrooms and barracks, including "A Seated Soldier With a Standing Serving Woman" (1652-55). A tavern vignette, it depicts a soldier wearing a broad-brimmed hat and armored chest protector sitting with his back to the viewer in front of a woman who raises a tall glass of beer. In the shadowy background two men play cards on a military drum. The interior space is shallow, and there's not much evidence of the artist's later achievements, save for the careful attention given to rendering surfaces.
By 1655 he had produced one of the first of his Delft interiors, "Mother and Child With a Servant Woman Sweeping" (1655-57). A mother sits near a fireplace with a dozing infant in her lap watching the sweeper. Leaded windows above give a view of a tiled roof. A lighted doorway leads to a back room, but the perspective is somewhat distorted. Still, it represents a better attempt to create receding pictorial space than the tavern scenes. But by 1658, Mr. Sutton writes, de Hooch had created "a new type of genre painting with unprecedented spatial order and naturalism." He had not left the drinking themes behind but now they, like his domestic scenes -- peopled mostly by women, children and servants -- were set in respectable courtyards, interiors and gardens, with well-ordered, psychologically pleasing progressions of spaces.
One highlight of the show, from the fertile year 1658, is a painting that brings into play all de Hooch's special talents: his brilliant use of perspective and his great skills at conveying light, color and surfaces. It depicts the courtyard of a brick house in Delft, with two women and a child. One of the women stands, back to the viewer, in a narrow arched passageway framed in brick that gives at the far end a glimpse of another building. The other woman leads a little girl down a low flight of steps out of a crude wooden shed that abuts the archway. The courtyard floor is neatly paved in yellow bricks that complement the red bricks of the arch; a patch of blue sky and the top of a tree appear over the shed.
In this startlingly structured picture, the eye is caught up in a lively bustle of doorways and other architectural framings, open and closed spaces and wood and brick surfaces that the figures vividly animate. The artist's game seems to be how much you can pack into a painting and still make it read. The multiple architectural elements of the busy canvas, done in two-point perspective, are nearly all fictitious, yet their artful assemblage gives the impression of repertorial accuracy.
The painting is paired in the show with one done at the same time using a very similar architectural composition but a different orchestration; for example, the shed on the right has given way to an arbor in which two men and a woman are drinking. But all the varied elements of color, texture, space and light are there again, and this painting, so much the same and yet so different, is no less a smash than the first.
Around 1661, with the decline of Delft as an art center, de Hooch -- like many other artists -- moved with his family to arriviste Amsterdam, the prosperous banking center of northern Europe. There, his style changed again, and not for the better. A foppish elegance descended on his paintings; the interiors became ornate, the figures elongated, almost Mannerist in style, and an atmosphere of overripe luxury prevailed.
Compare the plain but elegant portrait of a Delft clan he did in 1657-60 with his 1670 account of a wealthy merchant's family in Amsterdam. The first is a beautifully orchestrated view of three generations dressed in their somber Sunday best but informally assembled in an airy courtyard with a backdrop of city buildings. It is the largest of de Hooch's works and is, in short, a masterpiece. But the Amsterdam family, a group of stiff and oddly distorted figures garbed in sumptuous finery, is deployed in a stilted arrangement in a stuffy manorial room, the only real-looking body in it that of a squirming dog.
De Hooch also used Amsterdam's grandiose new City Hall as a setting for invented compositions, including family groups involved in such pastimes as music-making. And he pursued his old themes of card players and merrymakers along with domestic interiors. But many of these paintings, while virtuoso in performance, come off as rather stale stereotypes lacking the magical sweetness and simplicity of his work in Delft.
With its well-assembled group of paintings from important lenders all over the world, this one-and-only show is in itself something of a masterpiece, highly instructive and a lot of fun besides. And its impressive catalogue gives a good reading of the social, economic and political climate of the times. Too bad it won't come to New York, but Hartford's not very far.
 
"Pieter de Hooch, 1629-1684" remains on display at the Wadsworth Atheneum, 600 Main Street in Hartford, through Feb. 28.

HEADLINE: Ford's Idea for Safer Safety

BYLINE: By JAMES G. COBB 

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
IN an effort to reduce injuries caused by air bags and safety belts, the Ford Motor Company plans to add computer controls to its cars and light trucks that would activate safety devices in different ways, depending on the severity of a crash, the size of the car's occupants, the position of the driver's seat and whether safety belts are being used.
Ford's advanced restraints system, which will be phased in as vehicle designs are updated, would use a system of sensors to relay information to a central computer in the car, which could adjust the deployment rate of an air bag based on such factors as the force of a crash or how close the driver is to the steering wheel. It would prevent the bag from deploying at all in a minor crash that would be unlikely to cause serious injuries or if the passenger seat was unoccupied or being used by a small child who might be injured by the bag itself. 
 The system will include the seat-belt pretensioners, which are devices in the front belt mechanisms that tighten forcefully in a crash to hold occupants tightly and prevent them from bouncing around after impact. If sensors detect that the crash is quite severe, a metal bar in the spool of the belt retractor twists like a wrung-out rag to release the belt in a controlled manner, reducing the risk of chest injuries caused by a belt as it forcefully tightens.
About 20 traffic deaths a year among children and smaller women have been attributed to injuries caused by air bags.
Ford said its system would shut off the passenger bag completely if a weight sensor in the seat determined that the occupant was a child weighing less than 45 pounds. If the occupant weighed roughly 45 to 105 pounds, the bag would deploy at a lower inflation rate than if he or she weighed more than 105.
Ford announced its plan this week at the North American International Auto Show. Most components of the system will first appear on the 2000 Taurus later this year and will then be phased in on future models of all Ford cars, pickups, vans and sport utility vehicles. JAMES G. COBB

Brazilian Stocks Fall Sharply After State Threatens Default

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The Brazilian stock market tumbled yesterday after the Governor of one of the country's largest states said he would not make debt payments to the central Government for 90 days.
The announcement by Itamar Franco, the newly installed Governor of Minas Gerais and an interim President of Brazil from the end of 1992 to 1994, surprised investors and reminded them how bumpy the road to spending and tax reform will be here and in other emerging nations. "It is a demonstration that the Brazilian stability adjustment reform effort is a two-step-forward-and-one-step-backward process," said Arturo C. Porzecanski, chief economist for the Americas at ING Barings. 
 In Sao Paulo, the benchmark Bovespa stock index fell 5.1 percent, to 6,954.17. Traders and analysts said the threat of problems in Brazil also pulled the dollar lower and weighed on United States stock markets.
In the fall, Brazil was regarded as a bastion against the deepening of world financial crises that pushed some key stock indexes in the United States down 20 percent. Economists feared that a devaluation of Brazil's currency then, soon after Russia had defaulted on some of its debt, could lead to a worldwide recession.
The International Monetary Fund, and the the United States and other countries, assembled a $41.5 billion rescue package, which helped calm things down. In a positive note yesterday, the World Bank approved the distribution of two loans that are part of the package.
But the threatened default could make it even more difficult for Brazil's President, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, to reach the spending and deficit goals the country must meet to qualify for more payments from the rescue package. Even if the reform plan succeeds, many economists think that Brazil is headed into the sort of recession that will still require a currency devaluation.
"I think this is worrying, but it is good that we get it out of the system right now and that Cardoso appears to be strong," said Susan Gilbertson, head of Latin American research at Paribas.
In other emerging markets, the Philippine Government sold $1 billion of a global bond issue yesterday. Investors eagerly snapped up the bonds because their interest rates were so high. For example, the 10-year note had a yield of 9.123 percent, almost twice that on the 10-year United States Treasury note. The lead underwriters were J. P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Warburg Dillon Read.

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
Brooklyn Project Aims At People 75 and Older

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
Work began last month on transforming an empty lot along Emmons Avenue in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, into a 104-unit apartment building that will provide elderly tenants with meals, services and personal care.
When completed in 12 months, the $22 million project, called Sunrise on the Bay, will have studio to two-bedroom apartments with 300 to 700 square feet of space in a four-story brick building framing an interior courtyard. There will also be 10,000 square feet of first-floor medical office space in the building at 2211 Emmons Avenue, between Dooley and East 21st Streets. 
 The project, for people age 75 and older, is another indication of the growing demand for specialized housing for the elderly. Over the last 22 months, residences for older people who need help with daily chores but do not require constant medical care -- called assisted-living residences -- have begun to appear in New York City, which developers had avoided because of high costs and tough regulations.
Until recently, most New Yorkers who needed such housing had to turn to nursing homes or adult homes, which must be licensed by the state to provide personal and medical-related services. Under the state regulations, it would be difficult for large publicly owned companies to become providers of medical services.
The new projects have found a way around the regulations by separating the housing from the health care. Under this arrangement, developers and operators of the housing do not need any state licenses as long as the personal care is provided through an agency licensed by the state.
Sunrise on the Bay is being developed by the Atlantic Development Group of Manhattan in partnership with Sunrise Assisted Living Inc. of Fairfax, Va., one of the nation's larger assisted-living operators, which will manage the project. Dignity Home Care Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Sunrise and a licensed service provider in New York State, will provide the personal care. Financing is from Fleet Bank and the partners' own equity.
Though the Sheepshead Bay project is a first in southern Brooklyn, there are now at least eight other such developments under way or recently completed in New York City. Among those completed are a 126-unit project at Grand Army Plaza in Brooklyn and a 143-unit development at 117th Street and 84th Avenue in Kew Gardens, Queens. And a 206-unit development on Henry Hudson Parkway at West 239th Street in Riverdale in the Bronx is to be completed in June.
Demographics is a major reason that the partners at Atlantic Development Group, Marc Altheim and Peter Fine, turned their attention last year to New York City. Since 1995, they and other major assisted-living operators have developed a 122-unit project in Ossining in Westchester County and another with 100 units in Stratford, Conn.
"There's a tremendous demand for this type of housing in the New York City boroughs, where we believe the market is three to four times larger than in the suburbs, where we successfully have built such projects," Mr. Fine said. About 6,000 people 75 or older live within a three-mile radius of Sunrise on the Bay, he said.
John E. Nikas, chairman of Community Board 15, which helps guide growth in the area, said of the project: "Any additional services for the elderly are welcomed. But I don't know if Emmons Avenue is an appropriate location for such a development."
Emmons Avenue, a commercial corridor, has undergone a resurgence in recent years. The opening of a new shopping center anchored by a Loehmann's department store and the reopening of a Lundy's restaurant, which had been dark for over a decade, have helped turn around the area.
That new investment and "the buzz of activity" are what Mr. Fine said drew Atlantic to the nearly two-acre site, which had been used for parking and is among the last vacant tracts in the community. Its location adjacent to the shopping center and close to the water were also factors, as was its proximity to the middle-class and upper-middle-class residential neighborhoods of Sheepshead Bay and Manhattan Beach.
Last summer, the partners bought the site, on which zoning rules permitted a residential building to be constructed. They then teamed with Sunrise, which after acquiring Karrington Health, an assisted-living developer in Columbus, Ohio, last fall, now operates 115 projects in 20 states, including 5 developments in Westchester County and on Long Island.
"It is an opportunity at a time when we were ready to enter New York City," said John J. Noone, a senior vice president at Sunrise. "It is a grossly underserved market."
Sunrise on the Bay will offer apartment living with hotel-style services, including meals, housekeeping and social activities. Monthly rents, including services, are expected to be $2,200 to $3,800, plus an added fee of $600 for a second person. Personal care, like assistance with bathing and dressing, will be provided at an extra cost.
At those prices, Mr. Nikas, the community board chairman, questions how many local residents will be able to afford to live there.
Mr. Fine countered that "every community thinks the numbers are high because they equate them with monthly rents." But given that meals and services are included, "it becomes economical," he said, noting that tenants were expected to have an average income of $40,000 a year, excluding investments or real estate assets.

HEADLINE: PRO BASKETBALL;
Labor Deal Improves Odds of Keeping Nets' Core Intact

BYLINE: By CHRIS BROUSSARD 

 BODY:
Perhaps the time has come for the Nets to experience prosperity. Equipped with a talented roster, in the possession of new, philanthropic ownership, and outfitted with a fresh, state-of-the-art practice facility, the long-suffering franchise received more good news yesterday when the National Basketball Association's new collective bargaining agreement was ratified.
While the Board of Governors' unanimous acceptance of the deal signifies that all teams were pleased with the terms, the Nets are one of a handful of clubs with extra reason to celebrate. Like the Minnesota Timberwolves, the Los Angeles Lakers and the Cleveland Cavaliers, the Nets have a nucleus of exciting young players that would have been almost impossible to keep together under the former agreement. 
 But because individual salaries will now be capped for at least the next six years, the team's chances of keeping center Jayson Williams, guard Kerry Kittles and the swingman Keith Van Horn for several years have gone from so-so to very good. With limited maximum salaries, no competitor will be able to outbid the Nets for those players, and the Nets will not have to pay the roughly $300 million it might have taken to retain their services.
"Any team that truly wants to be significant in the N.B.A. has to be together for a period of time," Coach John Calipari of the Nets said. "If you look at Utah, Indiana and Chicago, the core of their teams have been together for seven, eight years, and that's why they're the best three teams in the league."
Minnesota, with its All-Star forward, Kevin Garnett, having signed a six-year, $126 million contract in 1997, had become the greatest example of how uncontrolled salaries could destroy a potential championship contender well before maturation. It would have been incredibly difficult, and perhaps financially perilous, for the Timberwolves to keep the All-Stars Stephon Marbury and Tom Gugliotta with Garnett making so much money. But under the new agreement, they have a legitimate chance to sign all three without ruining themselves economically.
The Lakers would probably have been forced to exceed Shaquille O'Neal's seven-year, $120 million contract to re-sign Kobe Bryant either this year or next -- a reality that might have put a strain on the team's chemistry -- but now Bryant can earn no more than $87 million over seven years. And competing teams can offer him no more than a six-year, $67.5 million deal.
In Cleveland last season, Zydrunas Ilgauskas, Derek Anderson, Brevin Knight and Cedric Henderson brightened the future of the Cavaliers by making the all-rookie team, and now the Cavs have a chance to keep them around All-Star Shawn Kemp for the several years.
The priority for the Nets is to re-sign the charismatic Williams, who is among the league's most coveted free agents. While Williams's well-known desire to stay in New Jersey gave the Nets the advantage all along, Seattle, Phoenix, Detroit and Charlotte were ready to tempt him with hefty offers that might have surpassed what the Nets wanted to pay. But now those clubs cannot push Williams's market value past $83 million over six years, while, because of the Larry Bird exception, the Nets can pay Williams nearly $106 million over seven years.
Under the former rules, it might have taken at least that much money to get him back. Williams, who has been outspoken about keeping the Nets' nucleus intact, said he did not mind making a little less money. "I think I lost a lot of money on this, but how much does one person need?" he said in reference to the new labor agreement.
Van Horn, who could have become the game's highest-paid player next summer, agreed with Williams. "If the most I can make is x amount of dollars, that's fine," said Van Horn, a second-year forward. "I'm not trying to break the bank. Once you get over a certain amount of money, there's not a whole lot of difference."
With the powerful agent David Falk representing him, Van Horn would have obliterated the bank as a free agent. While whispers of his becoming the league's first $200 million man were overstated, he probably would have commanded about $150 million on the open market. Now, he will have to settle for about half that.
Though Kittles, another Falk client, has one year remaining on his contract, the Nets could extend his deal when the league allows the free-agent bidding to begin on Jan. 18. A team executive said the Nets wanted to sign the shooting guard to a long-term deal but did not feel the urgency to do it before the season began.
"Anything that keeps our team together, I'm happy about," Calipari said of the long-term implications of the new labor agreement.
Keeping Williams, Kittles and Van Horn could enable the Nets to be one of, and remain among, the elite N.B.A. teams for the next decade.
REBOUNDS
In addition to re-signing JAYSON WILLIAMS, Coach JOHN CALIPARI said he wanted back the free-agent point guard SHERMAN DOUGLAS. The Nets paid Douglas the league minimum, $275,000, last season, and can offer him the median salary exemption of $1.75 million this year. . . . Since the Nets have 10 players signed who know Calipari's system, they will focus mainly on conditioning in training camp. Calipari's chief concern is injuries. "Something as small as a blister could keep a guy out for a week," he said. "But a week could be five games."

HEADLINE: Prosecution Almost Rests in the Microsoft Trial

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 7

 BODY:
As the last Government witness nears the end of his testimony, it is increasingly clear that the Government's antitrust case against Microsoft is an indictment not only of the business practices of the world's dominant software maker but also of its corporate character.
Witness after witness -- an executive roll-call of companies that drive today's economy, including Intel, I.B.M., Netscape Communications, America Online, Sun Microsystems and Apple Computer -- has portrayed the Microsoft Corporation as a bullying monopolist. The Justice Department charges that Microsoft is guilty of a litany of misconduct, including illegally using its market muscle to impose restrictive contracts, to engage in predatory pricing and to attempt to divide markets. 
 Microsoft took each step, the Government contends, to stifle competition and thwart the challenge that Internet software posed to its monopoly product, the Windows operating system, the computing equivalent of the telephone dial tone. On its face, the Government's case seems sweeping and persuasive. Yet as the trial has plodded since October through lengthy cross-examination of each witness, with both sides presenting mountains of E-mail and documents to support their arguments and counterarguments, there is certainly room for doubt. Each disputed meeting, contract and product strategy is open to interpretation.
There is no jury in this trial; Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson must wade through all the conflicting evidence and decide whether Microsoft's motives were mainly to impede competition or to improve its products. In determining which side to believe, he will inevitably be guided by his own judgment of whether Microsoft is a vigorous competitor or predatory monopolist.
That is why the Justice Department has gone to such lengths to depict Microsoft as a corporate bad guy and its chairman, William H. Gates, as evasive, uncooperative and less than truthful in the videotaped excerpts of his deposition testimony shown repeatedly in court.
The Microsoft E-mail and strategy documents show, at the least, a no-holds-barred approach to competition. In colorful language, they outline plans to "kill," "pollute" and "subvert" the products of rivals. Marketing campaigns are referred to as jihads.
Microsoft's world view seems tinged with paranoia. Close partners like the Compaq Computer Corporation and the Intel Corporation are at times painted as enemy conspirators. Nor are all the threats, apparently, outside the corporate campus in Redmond, Wash. In a 1997 E-mail to Mr. Gates, a senior Microsoft executive, warned, "In my opinion, Windows is in the process of being exterminated here at Microsoft."
Other Government evidence seeks to show that Mr. Gates remained dismissive of a long-running antitrust investigation, even after Microsoft signed a consent decree with the Justice Department in 1994. At a 1995 meeting with Intel, he said, according to an Intel executive: "This antitrust thing will blow over. We haven't changed our business practices at all."
Microsoft insists that its corporate culture is one of "constructive paranoia," insuring that it does not lose its competitive edge. Besides, Microsoft's legal team argues, inflammatory E-mail and unguarded comments have no standing in an antitrust case, which should be based on facts and figures.
"The antitrust laws are not a code of civility in business," John L. Warden, Microsoft's lead trial lawyer, told the court in his opening statement.
In the weeks since, however, Microsoft has introduced its own evidence -- including E-mail from rivals planning to gang up to "kill the beast from Redmond" -- to try to show that Microsoft's swagger and style are not unusual among high-technology companies.
Still, antitrust experts say that the corporation's character could prove important because the Government is trying to show a pattern of illegal behavior by Microsoft over years. If the Government wins, it could argue for far stronger sanctions against Microsoft than were anticipated at the start of the trial.
"It could prove to be one of the strongest cards the Justice Department has to play," said Robert Litan, a former senior official in the Justice Department's antitrust division, now at the Brookings Institution. "Justice is arguing that Microsoft is a recidivist, which has consistently shown a disregard for the antitrust laws. They are trying to convince the judge that he should deliver a strong guilty verdict and then do something big and substantial so Microsoft won't do it again."
Microsoft scoffs at such reasoning, asserting that the Government has simply not mounted much of a case. "The Justice Department has presented no critical mass of evidence against Microsoft," said William H. Neukom, senior vice president for law and corporate affairs. "There is no monopoly. There is no predatory pricing. There is no illegal tying of one product to another. Microsoft's contracts have not foreclosed other companies from distributing their products."
The Government's case, most antitrust experts agree, is a mixed bag of stronger and weaker claims -- all of which Microsoft will try to refute when it begins its defense next week.
The Justice Department, these experts say, seems to have done best in establishing that Microsoft has a monopoly in personal computer operating systems and has imposed restrictive contracts on computer makers and Internet service suppliers.
"The monopoly argument pretty much makes itself, and it certainly looks as if Microsoft has crossed the line in terms of exclusionary contracts," said Carl Shapiro, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley and a former senior official at the Justice Department.
Microsoft's first defense witness, Richard Schmalensee, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, will testify that despite its domination of the operating system market, Microsoft does not possess monopoly power. Mr. Schmalensee's rationale is that because of the rapid pace of innovation in the computer industry, Microsoft's dominance could be short-lived as it comes under attack from a variety of new technologies like Sun Microsystems' Java, an Internet programming language that could displace the pivotal role played by Windows.
Many technology experts regard that argument as only half true. "Microsoft is right when it says that its market position is under constant threat," said David Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard business school. But he added, "It would take a long time, a decade or so, to displace an entrenched technology standard like Windows."
The Government asserts that Microsoft's contracts with computer makers and Internet access suppliers unfairly excluded its main rival in the market for Internet browser software, the Netscape Communications Corporation, from key channels of distribution.
For example, America Online testified that it had agreed to make Microsoft's Internet Explorer the preferred browser for its subscribers instead of Netscape's Navigator after Microsoft agreed to give America Online a featured place on the Windows desktop -- an example, the Justice Department asserts, of Microsoft using its operating system monopoly to thwart competition.
Microsoft replies that its contracts are garden-variety business deals. Exclusive contracts with a handful of companies are not illegal, its lawyers say, as long as competitors have open access to many other channels of distribution. Netscape, Microsoft says, has distributed millions upon millions of copies of its browser -- proof that Netscape has not been hampered in any substantial way.
The Government's predatory pricing and product-tying charges, antitrust experts say, are the weaker elements of the case. The Justice Department contends that Microsoft's decision to give its browser away, despite having spent hundreds of millions of dollars developing it, is predatory. But the courts have generally rejected predatory pricing claims. In a landmark 1993 ruling in Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation, the Supreme Court declared that "discouraging a price cut does not constitute sound antitrust policy."
Similarly, experts say, the Government's charge that Microsoft illegally tied its browser software to Windows to squelch competition in the browser market will be difficult to prove. Microsoft contends that its browser is an integrated feature of Windows.
Many industry experts have questioned Microsoft's motivation for integrating its browser and operating system, but the courts have been reluctant to meddle in product decisions. In a related case, a Federal appeals court ruled in June that Microsoft could bundle its browser with Windows, noting the "undesirability of having courts oversee product design."
As Microsoft finished its cross-examination of the Government's final witness today, the two sides argued over the issues of bundling and free distribution of Microsoft's browser.
The questioning turned unusually testy as Michael Lacovara, a Microsoft lawyer, asked Franklin M. Fisher, an M.I.T. economist, about the costs associated with giving away the Internet Explorer. Mr. Fisher said that while it might be easier for computer makers and consumers, "this case is not about being easy."
"If Henry Ford had a monopoly, we'd all be driving black cars," he said, his voice slowly rising. "That's not what competition is about. That's not what helping consumers is about. If Microsoft forced upon the world one browser, that would be really simple."
"Now you seem agitated," Mr. Lacovara said.
"I am agitated," Mr. Fisher shot back. "I feel strongly on this point. We're going to live in a Microsoft world. It may be a nice world. But it's not a competitive world."

Dow Recovers From an Early Slide to Close Down 7.21, to 9,537.76

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Stocks retreated from record levels but then rallied in the afternoon and finished little changed in a session marked by some warnings of profit shortfalls and a mildly negative reappraisal by one of Wall Street's most prominent strategists.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 7.21 points, to 9,537.76, after a slide from the start of trading that put the blue-chip barometer down as much as 118.95 points. The Nasdaq market, down early, even managed to climb back into positive territory to another record, its fifth in a row. It rose 5.23 points, or two-tenths of a percent, to 2,326.09. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 2.61 points, or two-tenths of a percent, to 1,269.73 
 "What we're seeing is backing and filling after a pretty amazing run," said Douglas R. Cligott, chief United States equity strategist at J. P. Morgan. And while he called valuations "clearly stretched," he said stocks could keep advancing for at least several weeks as retail investors join portfolio managers in putting cash that builds up at this time of year to work.
J. C. Penney and Borders Group dampened early sentiment by warning of earnings shortfalls. The shares of J. C. Penney fell 3 5/16, to 43; Borders dropped 5 1/16, to 20.
The market also had to digest a reduction in stocks, to 70 percent from 72 percent, in the portfolio mix recommended by Abby Joseph Cohen, the widely followed chief strategist at Goldman, Sachs. This was the first change since Sept. 1, when Ms. Cohen raised her equity weighting from 65 percent.
"Equity valuation is less attractive today than in September," she said, "but we do not view valuation as excessive nor as an impediment to higher stock prices." She suggested moving money from stocks to higher-yielding corporate bonds, whose allocation she raised to 12 percent from 10 percent.
Also bringing down the market were comments made by Alice Rivlin, vice chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, who said that one must be "extremely optimistic about earnings to justify" current stock prices.
And while European markets were moderately lower, Brazilian stocks dropped 5.14 percent on fresh setbacks to efforts to bring the budget under control.
But when the combined weight of these developments failed to severely buckle the market, analysts said, buyers stepped in and prices mostly recovered.
"We continue to have a very favorable environment for equities," said Leif H. Olsen, a director of Absolute Return Advisors in Manchester, Vt., predicting a stronger economy this year than is generally forecast.
Several financial stocks stood out today, among them Citigroup, which surged 4 1/8, to 58 1/2, making the biggest positive contribution to the Dow. Chase Manhattan climbed 3 1/16, to 77 1/16; BankAmerica was up 3 3/16, to 67 9/16, and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter climbed 3 1/2, to 84 3/16.
The main drag on the Dow was Procter & Gamble, which fell 2, to 90 7/8, as it lost a top executive in its Asian operations to Kellogg.
Declining issues on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered advancing ones by 1,954 to 1,142 as volume eased to 863 million shares, from 986.9 million on Wednesday.
In the bond market, the prices of Treasury issues fell as the dollar weakened. The price of the 30-year bond fell 30/32, to 100 14/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.22 percent, from 5.16 percent on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
Wall St. Firms Nimbly Handle A Hard Quarter

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
Wall Street's major trading houses, buffeted by the financial upheaval that began when Russian markets collapsed in August, are starting to breathe a little easier.
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Company and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., two of the country's largest investment banking firms, soundly beat estimates for their fourth-quarter earnings yesterday, the latest sign of how resilient United States financial markets have proved to be in the wake of global economic turmoil. 
 "It's a measure of how quickly firms and markets have turned around since the early fall," said Derek J. Statkevicus, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. "The trading desks have done much better than people expected."
Shares of Citigroup soared $4.125, or almost 7.6 percent yesterday, to $58.50, as investors saw that company's trading operation benefiting from the same financial buoyancy enjoyed by rivals.
Still, Morgan Stanley and Lehman turned in sharply divergent performances, with Morgan producing stellar gains while Lehman's profits were far below those posted in the fourth quarter of 1997. In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Morgan Stanley's shares jumped $3.50, or 4.3 percent, to $84.1875, while Lehman's shares rose 50 cents, to $54.125.
Moreover, even though international markets have settled down recently, the fragility of Brazil's economy -- and the financial damage that could be inflicted on the United States should Brazil's situation worsen -- looms over American financial services companies.
"There's a lot of money coming into the market right now and people might be unpleasantly surprised if things turn worse in Brazil," said Judah Kraushaar, an analyst with Merrill Lynch & Company.
Morgan Stanley, citing a strong results from its securities operation in a year marked by unnerving stock market volatility, said that net income for the fourth quarter ended Nov. 30 rose 51 percent, to $1.2 billion, or $2.07 a share, compared with $810 million, or $1.30 a share, in the period a year earlier.
The fourth quarter of 1998 included a large one-time gain on the sale of some business lines. Excluding that gain, Morgan Stanley's operating earnings still rose 9 percent, to a record $879 million, or $1.49 a share. Analysts had been expecting Morgan to report operating earnings of 96 cents a share in the quarter, according to the consensus estimate of analysts surveyed by the First Call Corporation. Morgan Stanley posted operating earnings of $626 million, or $1.05 a share, in the third quarter.
Typically, Morgan Stanley's securities business -- which includes securities underwriting, mergers and acquisitions advice, other investment-banking services and retail brokerage activities -- produces the lion's share of the company's profits. The fourth quarter was no exception. Morgan said about half its profit in the quarter came from its securities operation, powered by gains in mergers and acquisitions advice that more than offset an industrywide downturn in underwriting.
Robert Scott, Morgan Stanley's chief financial officer, said that the company's traders "tore the cover off the ball" by moving into Treasury securities and realizing big gains once other investors sought the same safe haven after stock and bond markets around the world went haywire in the late summer and early fall. The company also said that currency and commodities trading generated record results.
Profits from Morgan Stanley's asset-management business were up smartly in the quarter compared with 1997, though down compared with the third quarter, when the company registered losses on some troubled investment funds it was forced to bail out. The company's Discover credit card operation still lacks the scale to compete effectively with the larger credit card businesses controlled by competitors, but Morgan Stanley said it was planning to devote substantial resources to expanding the card business, particularly overseas.
Over all, Morgan Stanley is one of the few financial-services companies, with the exception of the Chase Manhattan Corporation, that appear to have navigated last year's unpredictable financial shoals successfully. "It's a very, very powerful company," said John Keefe, president of Keefe Worldwide, a financial-services consulting firm in New York.
Lehman, on the other hand, has had a far rougher time, largely because it does not dominate as many businesses as Morgan Stanley does and because it is still overly reliant on its large bond underwriting and trading operation -- a reliance that can hammer the company if it plays the bond markets incorrectly.
Lehman said it had net income of $74 million, or 51 cents a share, in the fourth quarter ended Nov. 30, down 60 percent from $185 million, or $1.30 a share, in the period a year earlier. Lehman earned $151 million, or $1.10 a share, in the third quarter.
Analysts had expected Lehman to earn 21 cents a share in the quarter and they attributed the surprise to better-than-expected results in its investment-banking business. Still, Lehman said its trading revenues were down sharply because of market volatility in September and October that hurt its bond business.
Lehman noted that even though it had a weak quarter the firm posted record results for the year as a whole. It also said it is optimistic about 1999 because of a recovery in the bond market and a backlog of debt and equity underwritings that should lift the bottom line.
"We're off to a gangbusters start in January, and the fundamentals of a good year are in place," John Cecil, Lehman's chief administrative officer, said.

Clinton Takes A Middle Path On Steel Curbs

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 7

 BODY:
The White House told Congress tonight that President Clinton would not yet limit imports of foreign steel to the United States, despite the demands of steel unions and some producers, but would take a range of lesser actions intended to aid the industry.
In a report to Congress submitted days after a Congressional deadline while Mr. Clinton and his economic team debated the politically charged issue, the White House said it would seek to extend a $300 million tax break for steel producers. That may provide some modest relief to the companies, but would be only of indirect help to the United Steelworkers of America, the politically powerful union that had demanded sharp limits on Russian, Japanese, Korean and Brazilian steel that it said is being dumped in the American market. 
 The report also warns Japan, the largest exporter of some kinds of steel, that the Government would begin a broad investigation that could lead to tariffs on many types of Japanese steel if a surge of exports did not abate. Japanese shipments increased more than 400 percent in the first nine months of 1998.
In the end, the Administration stopped short of actually beginning that legal process, called a Section 201 proceeding, which many of the companies had urged in hopes of sending a stronger message to Japan and other nations.
The decision today came after a sharp split in the Administration. Trade officials, led by Commerce Secretary William M. Daley and the United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, had urged tougher action. But Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin had expressed what he delicately termed "reservations" about strong action, fearing it would send a signal that the United States was shutting off its markets to low-cost imports.
The steel glut was caused in large part by the Asian economic crisis, and encouraging exports by the Asian producers has been a key element of the strategy to get their nations back on track. The result, however, has been a surging trade deficit in the United States, as inexpensive foreign goods flood into the country.
"This has been a constant balancing act," a senior Administration official said tonight, "between trying to help the industry and the workers, without sending out a chilling message around the world."
The White House tax proposal would essentially permit American steel producers to write off losses against taxes paid in the previous five years, rather than against taxes the previous two years. The industry would save about $300 million, the Treasury estimates.
But that is a token amount compared with the losses caused by low-cost steel. And it is unlikely to end the debate over what kind of actions Washington should take, especially if layoffs continue in the steel industry.
The arguments over what to do about steel have been the source of several meetings at the White House involving Mr. Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, Mr. Rubin and in some cases Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright.
But the Administration found that its legal options were limited. It could not impose quotas, which are illegal under World Trade Organization rules. It was even reluctant to enter into "voluntary trade restraint" agreements, of the kind that used to govern auto and machine-tool trade with Japan. Those agreements, too, are now subject to challenge under international trading rules.
Nonetheless, members of the Congressional Steel Caucus have urged the Administration to negotiate voluntary restraint agreements with foreign producers, arguing that no countries are likely to challenge the accords in front of the World Trade Organization.
But the United Steelworkers and its president, George Becker, have gone further, urging outright quotas. They are powerful in Washington, and neither Mr. Clinton nor Mr. Gore, who needs their support in his bid for the Presidential nomination, wanted to alienate them. The report to Congress says that Mr. Clinton will appoint a White House official to speed "trade adjustment assistance" already legislated for steelworkers who have been laid off.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
The Carpet of Contempt

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
So here we are at the U.N. A half-century ago it was created to keep peace and expand freedom, not a feckless dream but a reachable goal dear to the United States, the key founding member.
Now the U.N. is carpeted in contempt for the U.S., for failure to use either its material power or what remains of its intellectual power to eliminate a minor dictator with major plans for mass slaughter. 
 The case of Secretary General Kofi Annan is part of the change at the U.N.
Power voids are filled, quickly. Mr. Annan moved into the emptiness created by the failure of American leadership against Saddam Hussein. He brought into his expanding role great charm and wit, and a clear concept of how to handle Saddam -- with diligent appeasement.
By himself, he has become Saddam's greatest single asset at the U.N. And with Russia, China, France and other countries "sympathetic to Iraqi sentiments," as it is put at the U.N., he is part of an active coalition, along with selected top members of the huge U.N. bureaucracy.
The coalition is determined to whittle U.N. arms inspection down to a useless splinter and lift U.N. economic sanctions on Iraq. That would open the road for Saddam to reach his goal of chemical, nuclear and biological weapons.
Don't worry, the coalition says, look at how many countries already have the weapons and don't use them. Concentrate on all the potential trade with Iraq.
This coalition does not exist because of its own strength. It exists because of the absence of American strategy for either eliminating Saddam's weapons potential or eliminating him.
With its three-day missile attacks, followed immediately by thinning out American strength in the region, Washington does not fool itself, Saddam or the U.N., and certainly not Mr. Annan.
Mr. Annan is sometimes a subtle man. I do not know what motivates him to try to appease Saddam. Possibly belief that unless somebody steps in, American policy will lead to disaster for all. Possibly the deep layer of third-world allegiances at the U.N.
But his techniques are not subtle. Each time Saddam ties up or throws out U.N. inspection, in violation of its peace agreement with the U.N., Mr. Annan waits awhile. Then after lots of secret hocus-pocus he pulls out the solution -- a new agreement in which Saddam again promises to cooperate with inspection, and again gets a good-boy reward, a weaker inspection system more acceptable to Iraq, for awhile.
A few months later, promise broken, same Annan show of compassion, the same hocus-pocus solution and promises; so on.
The Clinton Government does not criticize him. After all, it fought to get him named Secretary General, and usually gives its approval before and after his routines with Saddam.
Even when he praised Saddam's Government for its "wisdom, courage and flexibility" in February 1998 there was no criticism -- not even when he signed a "Memo of Understanding" with Iraq endorsing Saddam's indispensable lie. The memo says that "paramount" to the people and Government of Iraq is removal of sanctions against Iraq. Mr. Annan knows sanctions would quickly be eased and ended if Saddam carried out his 1991 promises to reveal his concealed weaponry and plans, within 15 days.
The reports from the inspectors headed by Richard Butler of Australia reveal Saddam's concealment. That is why Mr. Annan and Iraq are so intent about weakening the commission, why stories are floated that Mr. Butler's inspectors are U.S. spies -- to weaken the inspectorate so badly that Mr. Butler will resign.
As long as those Butler reports keep coming, Mr. Annan and other Iraq friendlies know the U.S. will veto lifting of sanctions. Probably -- is that creaking and cracking we hear in Washington's support for sanctions against the Iraqi tyranny?
The American public, as always, must share responsibility with its elected Government on what it does or does not do.
Despite the reports by U.N. inspectors about Saddam's concealment, despite his decision to force Iraqis to suffer sanctions rather than reveal his weapons of mass destruction, Americans seem entirely relaxed.
Yes, there was the World Trade Center bombing. But you don't really think terrorists would also use anthrax over here, actually use it?

HEADLINE: In the End, Most Retailers Had a Happy Holiday

BYLINE: By LESLIE KAUFMAN 

 BODY:
What was supposed to be a good season for retailers turned out to be a great one instead as last-minute and post-holiday shopping propelled December sales gains to their highest in half a decade, according to figures released yesterday by merchants.
Fears that the impeachment of President Clinton, the bombing of Iraq and unseasonably warm weather would dampen holiday buying turned out to be unfounded. The humming of the strong economy -- the best real-wage growth since 1985 and an impressive end-of-year rebound by the stock market -- was the only tune Americans seemed to hear. "Consumer confidence has remained outrageously high," said David Blitzer, the chief economist at Standard & Poor's. 
 In all, same-store sales, or sales in stores open at least a year, a standard industry measure, rose 5.2 percent, according to the Goldman Sachs Retail Composite Index. Last year, December same-store sales rose a hardy 4.1 percent, but not since 1994, when retailers posted a 5.6 percent gain, has the growth been so robust. Richard Baum, a retail analyst with Goldman, Sachs, said, "You are not going to hear too many retailers complaining that Santa Claus was not kind to them."
But, in what is becoming a seasonal pattern, shoppers kept merchants waiting until the last minute to deliver the good news. Three weeks into the season, retailers were reporting solid but not stellar numbers. The week before Christmas, however, had the four busiest shopping days of the year, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers.
Jay Allen, a spokesman for Wal-Mart Stores Inc., said: "We had a good holiday period, but it was late in coming. The week before Christmas we saw a real spike in business." Mr. Allen said that although late buying had clearly become a characteristic of the Christmas season, it was also part of a larger trend. "People are generally buying closer to need; back-to-school is another good example," he said.
Mr. Allen's description of Wal-Mart's sales as "good" was modest to say the least. Discounters continued to reign supreme among merchants. And Wal-Mart, the largest retailer in the world, could have powered the holiday season increases practically by itself with a same-store sales increase of 9.4 percent. Right behind Wal-Mart were Target, a unit of the Dayton Hudson Corporation, and Family Dollar Stores Inc., with increases of about 7 percent each.
And after shoppers got their cut-price scented candles and Furbies, there was still plenty of money left to spread around other sectors. Jewelers, from the upscale Tiffany & Company to the mass-marketer Zale Corporation, had sparkling seasons as shoppers snapped up diamond-stud earrings and gold bracelets. Specialty stores, led by the Gap Inc., whose sales rose 19 percent, also had reason to celebrate.
Even many of the department store chains, which were pummeled in recent years, fared well this season. In particular, Federated Department Stores Inc., which owns Bloomingdale's and Macy's, announced a startling same-store sales rise of 5.7 percent, compared with a 1 percent rise last year. Carol Sanger, vice president for corporate affairs, could not help but brag a bit. "At the beginning of the year, after last year's disappointing holiday season, we really sat down and made a concerted effort to develop strategies for this Christmas selling period," she said. "And apparently it worked."
Ms. Sanger said that the company had been especially successful with gift-giving promotions that highlighted select items with careful packaging and heavy promotion. Packages of fruit preserves and jellies nestled in wooden crates and matched berry-colored sweater sets were big hits, for example.
Not everyone did well, however. J. C. Penney Company saw same-store sales slide a whopping 7.6 percent despite its own preseason forecast of a rise of 1 percent to 2 percent. Theda Page Whitehead, J. C. Penney's public relations manager, blamed warm weather and a spate of early retirements in 1997 that left the company with 500 to 600 new store managers.
Toys "R" Us Inc. ended a disastrous year with a drubbing as discounters cut further into its territory, particularly on electronic toys. "There was a lack of hot toys," said the company's chief financial officer, Louis Lipschitz. Nordstrom Inc. will not release its sales figures until the end of its fourth quarter, but analysts were predicting same-store numbers for December would be down by 5 percent to 7 percent. The company would not comment on its performance.
The next question is whether the sales announcements will translate into solid earnings. In recent years, merchants have been forced to cut prices to attract increasingly demanding customers. The result is that increased sales come at the sacrifice of profit. This year, the promotional environment was as fierce as ever, but retailers said they anticipated that and planned accordingly.
Many retail analysts are optimistic that profits will be solid when earnings are announced in several weeks. Jeff Feiner, an analyst with Lehman Brothers, said: "On balance, the companies that did very well -- the Wal-Marts, Costcos and the Targets -- did not give away the store. We believe profitability was very good."
Bruce Van Kleeck, president of the National Retail Federation, said he also expected overall profits would be good but added a note of caution. "Many retailers had planned high markdowns," he said. "But I am not sure quite so high" as they eventually took.
Sue Wollan Fan, a partner with Andersen Consulting's global retail practice, was even more skeptical. "It is a mixed bag of the desperates and the deliberates," she said of the stores that engaged in heavy price cutting. "Not everyone who got good sales figures is going to make it to the winner's circle when earnings are announced."

Lockout Left Many Cash Drawers Locked

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

 BODY:
Through the 191-day National Basketball Association lockout, the economic losers were not only the players and the owners. There are the television networks that lost lucrative programming and the advertisers who lost a reliable way to reach young male viewers.
There are the arenas that lost revenues and were hamstrung from booking other events; broadcasters who were not paid, like Bob Papa, the Nets' radio voice, and hotels and restaurants that lost patronage from teams and fans. 
 "By the time a sold-out crowd here buys tickets, food and novelties, they've spent $1 million per game," said Richard Krezwick, president of the Fleet Center, the Boston Celtics' home.
There are the companies that make and sell T-shirts, jackets and replica uniforms licensed by the N.B.A., a $3 billion retail business in good times.
There are the concession workers, vendors, security guards and ushers -- some paid hourly wages, some paid on commission.
"I didn't rely on this income," said Ed Piseck, 30, who made about $100 a month as a bartender at McNichols Arena, home of the Denver Nuggets. "I just used it to pay off debt and for the new baby's college fund."
Millions of dollars have been rebated to season ticket-holders for unplayed November and December games. More will be refunded next month for January. Millions of dollars more were lost by retailers who cut back on N.B.A.-licensed merchandise the fans were avoiding. "All over, there were double-digit drops in sales," said Chris McEvoy, editor in chief of Sporting Goods Business.
The television networks that carry N.B.A. games refocused their programming. TNT and TBS, the Turner Sports cable networks, will have lost 50 telecasts through the end of January, and have filled the gaps since November with films.
NBC replaced its Christmas doubleheader in part with the movie "It's a Wonderful Life" and will fill its planned January telecasts with taped golf, skiing and other events. The Fox Sports Net has used classic N.B.A. games and other programs to replace 546 of about 1,000 games it would normally carry through local cable deals with 26 of the 29 N.B.A. teams.
"It will be a down year," predicted Neal Pilson, a sports consultant, "but better to have a down year that's a half-season than no season at all."
How much fan apathy will affect viewership and attendance is unknown. The uncertainty of post-lockout viewing is compounded by worries about Michael Jordan's status.
One of Jordan's newest enterprises, a $50 coffee-table book with high expectations called "For the Love of the Game," has underperformed, said Mary Ellen Keating, a spokeswoman for Barnes & Noble. "It's doing O.K., but people thought he'd be doing promotions," she said. Michael Jordan Cologne sold well in department stores and foreign markets during the lockout, but faltered in sporting-goods stores. "Fortunately, from the start, we created and positioned Michael Jordan Cologne as a celebrity-designer fragrance, instead of marketing it as a sports fragrance," said Sally Yeh, president of Bijan Fragrances, the scentmaker.
The league and players will have to woo disaffected fans, but they will move directly into a season, an edge it has over major league baseball, which endured an off-season and a spring training with replacement players before resuming normal operations after the 1994 strike.
"The wounds will heal by playing games," said Jon Spoelstra, a marketing consultant and former Nets president. "The league's greatest promotion would be for Michael to come back. A farewell tour would be a great marketing tool."
A lot of advertising and merchandising dollars are at stake. J. C. Penney, the largest retailer of N.B.A.-licensed merchandise, will wait until the season starts to advise its stores on restocking goods. Business fell by 70 percent in markets with N.B.A. teams.
"How the teams do may be the gauge," said Stephanie Brown, a Penney's spokeswoman. "I don't think they'll immediately call suppliers to order a ton of merchandise."
Michael Modell, co-president of the Modell's chain, said his N.B.A. business shrank substantially but the stores survived well with hot-selling Jets and Yankees merchandise.
"We'll have to wait a while to order more because so many players don't know where they'll be playing," he said.
Recently, Sporting Goods Business reported that N.B.A.-licensed business was down by nearly 50 percent for the fall and holiday season and orders would tumble by 80 percent for the spring. The magazine forecast a smaller drop for basketball sneakers, which were already in a sales retreat in the past few years.
"When there are no games, retailers don't reorder, they discount and get the merchandise the heck out," said Frank Vuono, a former N.F.L. Properties executive who is the president of Integrated Sports International, a New Jersey-based sports marketing firm.
Reebok's basketball shoe sales, led by Allen Iverson's $115 signature brand, are down by 8 to 10 percent.
"We produced 40 percent less of the Iverson product than last year," said Shawn Neville, senior vice president and general manager of Reebok North America.
As much as the lockout compelled fans, owners, players, television executives, capmakers, retailers and shoe retailers to contemplate a season without the N.B.A., it made part-time workers mull their low-profile plights.
Sam Gottlieb, 28, said his family's four parking lots near the Fleet Center in Boston have lost $200,000 without Celtics games. "Everyone loses," he said. "You just go on, you know? You hope it comes back."
Pam Morgan, 46, a part-time luxury suite attendant at America West Arena in Phoenix, earned extra money to give to her daughter, a college student. During a Coyotes hockey game Tuesday night, Morgan said: "If they don't care about the little peon, they sure should. If it wasn't for us, they wouldn't be employed."

HEADLINE: Foes of L.I. Mansion Lose a Zoning Battle

BYLINE: By CHARLIE LeDUFF 

DATELINE: SOUTHAMPTON, N.Y. Jan. 7

 BODY:
The battle of the billionaire versus the millionaires came to a head at Town Hall here tonight, and the billionaire won. For now, at least.
Ira Rennert, a reclusive industrialist who enraged residents here with his plan to erect a five-building, $100 million complex on 63 acres, will be allowed to continue construction in an oceanside potato field in the back reaches of Sagaponack, the Zoning Board of Appeals ruled. The project, which would cover more than 100,000 square feet, is to include a 72,000-square-foot main residence that Mr. Rennert says is to be a single-family home. 
 About 50 people who attended the board's meeting at Town Hall tonight sighed as Edward Rush, the board's chairman, announced that the permits given to Mr. Rennert were valid. "Denial of a land use permit based solely on community opposition is impermissible," Mr. Rush said.
He added that the number of bathrooms (40), refrigerators (5, industrial) and bowling alleys (2) were not inconsistent with a large oceanfront mansion.
Linda Francke, a writer and not a millionaire who lives cater-corner to the site, was resigned. "In my mind it's welcome to the neighborhood," she said. "I always thought we were just whistling in the wind."
Opponents of the project said that the five-member zoning board, appointed by the Town Supervisor, Vincent Cannuscio, gave in to Mr. Rennert's deep pockets. Mr. Rennert's Renco Group was listed by Forbes magazine in 1997 as the 51st largest private company in America.
Mr. Cannuscio had sided with townspeople who wanted the project stopped, but reversed his position when a town lawyer warned Southampton that it would face a costly lawsuit it could not win if it tried to revoke permits that had already been issued.
The plan for the home -- which would be larger than San Simeon, or twice the size of the White House -- galvanized opponents who charged that Mr. Rennert's claim that the home would be occupied only by himself, his wife and his two adult daughters was a scheme to evade building and environmental regulations.
Albert Bialek, president of the Sagaponack Homeowners Association, which has raised $70,000 to prevent Mr. Rennert from blocking his and his neighbors' view of the ocean, asked how Mr. Rennert could call "a development with 6 outbuildings, a power plant, parking for 200 cars, 40 bathrooms, 29 bedrooms, 165 seat movie theater, a restaurant kitchen with five refrigerators and a grease trap of 1,500 gallons, two bowling alleys, a 3 million B.T.U. furnace, foot-thick walls and a network of underground tunnels a one-family home?"
"Yeah, sure," he said. "And I'm the King of Siam."
Mr. Bialek said he and 60 other residents would meet to plot their next move, most likely a lawsuit in State Supreme Court in Riverhead.
It is a move that Mr. Rennert's lawyers anticipate. "This is a single family home," said one of the lawyers, Anthony Tohill. "It is a big single-family home, but it is a single-family home nevertheless. I can see this thing is going to be in litigation for years, you can bet on that."
Last night, the speculation was thick at Town Hall as residents wondered whether Mr. Rennert, a New York businessman with a passion for Orthodox Jewish causes, was planning some sort of bunker or religious complex.
"What's it for?" asked Carolyn Hendrickson, a retired librarian who has lived in Southampton for more than 30 years. "Does he think in the year 2000 he and his associates will have to hole up in the ground? Is he expecting some cataclysm? Is it going to be a religious school or retreat of some kind? I don't trust him."
According to officials at Barney Skanska, the international construction firm handling the project, the concrete foundations of Mr. Rennert's home have been poured, and the setting of the steel girders will begin next month.
"It's a private residence for a man and his family and everything is up to code," said Edward P. Costello, senior vice president with the company. "Last time I checked, the flag still flies over this country, and the man has a right to build his home."
Not everyone in Southampton was upset by Mr. Rennert's plans. While the town is famous as an enclave of the rich and famous -- the author Kurt Vonnegut has a home here, as do Edwin and Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, the writer Peter Matthiessen, the actor Roy Scheider and the director Andre Gregory -- residents who live here year round and scrape out a living doing odd jobs and construction, are in some ways glad to see the house going up. It means more work for them.
"It's putting money into the local economy," said Michael O'Shea, a carpenter from East Hampton who was working on a neo-colonial home not far from the Fair Field site, as Mr. Rennert calls it. "The fishermen are having a bad time. And most of the wealthy people pack it in for the winter and go elsewhere. The money's important to working men."
Mr. Costello said his company has hired union truck drivers, landscapers, sanitation workers and well diggers from the area.
A security guard who patrols the property is a local police officer.
Opponents of the mansion said they were disappointed at the low turnout on this cold January evening. They figured that many homeowners had gone away for the winter.

HEADLINE: Manufacturing Orders Increase

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 7

 BODY:
Orders placed with United States manufacturers rose six-tenths of a percent in November, the fifth increase in six months, as domestic demand offset weak exports, Commerce Department figures showed today.
The gain was led by metals, electronic instruments and chemicals. Orders dropped for textiles, electronic parts and lighting equipment. Orders fell 1.7 percent in October. 
 In another sign of economic strength, the number of workers applying for state unemployment benefits declined last week, the Labor Department said.
First-time claims fell by 22,000 in the week ended Saturday to a seasonally adjusted 350,000. The four-week average for jobless claims -- a less volatile gauge than the weekly figure, rose to 327,750, from 322,250 the previous week.
Jobless claims have fluctuated in recent weeks because of seasonal employment, reduced filing days, and other circumstances surrounding the holidays, analysts said.
For 1998, weekly claims averaged 317,208, compared with 321,135 in 1997 and 350,442 in 1996. The total number of people collecting unemployment benefits in 1998 averaged 2.215 million a week, down from 2.295 million in 1997 and 2.549 million in 1996.

Next Step Is Courting The Fans

BYLINE: By MIKE WISE 

 BODY:
After the National Basketball Association's 29 owners officially insured labor peace for the next six years, Commissioner David Stern was asked if he was bluffing when he said he would scrap the season. "You didn't pay to find out," he said, smiling.
In the same hotel conference room where the owners were scheduled to vote on canceling the season, they instead unanimously ratified a new collective bargaining agreement with the players as the league continued its kiss-and-make-up tour yesterday. 
 Flanked by his deputy commissioner, Russ Granik, and Billy Hunter, the union's executive director, Stern shed some light on an abbreviated season while also making a plea for renewed fan support.
"We are painfully aware of the beating that professional athletes and teams have taken at the hands of the public," he said. "We have talked about changing the paradigm. We have talked to teams about understanding the history and what is going on. This is the next step in that process. I ask you to judge us in a year."
Stern said the season would start on Feb. 5, and teams will play 50 games, most of which will be intraconference, though details are being worked out. If Michael Jordan returns, the chance for many Western Conference cities to see him are slim.
"In terms of the schedule, I am sure that what we will end up with is one that is much more conference-oriented than what we normally have, largely for travel reasons," Granik said. "Teams will play most of their games, the vast majority, within their own conference, although there will be some interconference play. A team from the East may play only five or six teams from the West. That is just the way the numbers are going to break out."
In a quest to win back fans, each team plays one exhibition game at home and another on the road, with no admission charged.
Stern added that beginning next season, at least 500 tickets for every regular-season game would be held until game time and priced at $10 each.
The expected outcome at the N.B.A. board of governors meeting came after players had approved the deal, by a vote of 179 to 5, on Wednesday. The lockout will remain until the agreement is in written form, which could take 10 days.
Concerned over the shape that players would be in, the union and the league agreed to open team facilities on Monday. Players will be allowed to work with trainers, but not directly with coaches. The hope was that the agreement could be reduced to writing by lawyers by next week and the free-agent signing period would begin by Jan. 18.
The regular season will last through April, with the playoff format unchanged. Granik said the N.B.A. finals should conclude by June 29 or 30.
"We're glad this is over,"' Hunter said. "Our players are anxious to play, and we're anxious to join hands with David, Russ and the owners of the 29 teams to really create a strong and familial relationship -- one that will take the N.B.A. to another level and to bring back the fans.
"The only regret I have is that it took us so long to get where we are. We're glad to be back, and we'll do whatever we have to do in order to demonstrate that."
The most debilitating labor war in league history cost the players nearly $500 million in salaries. It ended Wednesday morning after an all-night, 12-hour negotiating session at the league offices.
The owners emerged with the unprecedented concession of a maximum limit on individual salaries.
The days of one or two players gobbling up a team's salary cap and making it impossible for a franchise to sign a third star may be on the wane. Also, a player's need for a prominent agent to get him the most lucrative deal possible seemed to be reduced. But as to whether it would dramatically change N.B.A. economics, Stern was not prepared to say.
"There is no certainty for us with respect to payrolls," Stern said. "That said, it was very important for us to come up with a formula where teams could remain competitive. For us that was the essence of what a sports league is -- competition. We think that this is going to eliminate the movement because of economic disparity.
Asked about the impact of the deal on agents, Hunter said: "I don't think this agreement is going to in any way negate the need for agents. Obviously, when you're trying to keep 400, 500 ballplayers solidified, I still think there is going to be a great need for agents."
Beyond agents, general managers as well as league and team lawyers are going to be busy beginning Jan. 18. Three weeks of trades and free-agent signings are expected to significantly alter the playoff picture. More than 200 free agents will be bid upon, including Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman, Charles Barkley, Antonio McDyess and Jayson Williams.
Once the games start, players will be faced with an exhausting schedule until the playoffs begin. Teams will be asked on occasion to play three games in three nights, something that has not happened in the last 10 years.
"I'm sure it is going to be a mad scramble," Stern said.
To insure NBC and Turner are compensated for missed games -- the networks paid a combined $23 million to each team as part of their broadcasting agreement -- several interconference games will be retained.
As the league tried to put back the pieces yesterday, though, worrying about television seemed almost trite. "We're glad to be back in the basketball business again," Granik said.
 Hunter sat with his arms folded for most of the press conference, happy to let Stern explain why the two sides waged such a bitter fight for six months. After the last question was asked, the two adversaries shook hands. Lawyers who had traded angry words during the dispute joked and shook hands.
For a moment, the logistical nightmare of putting together a 50-game season in 12 weeks did not seem so daunting.
"We're doing this a bit on the run," Granik said. "We're happy to be planning the season. We were planning for a nonseason."

Rehnquist Formally Opens Clinton Impeachment Trial
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist opened the first Presidential impeachment trial in 131 years, swearing in senators to "do impartial justice" in judging whether President William Jefferson Clinton should be removed from office for perjury and obstruction of justice. A1
 
The White House warned that if the Senate called witnesses to testify about Mr. Clinton, it might use every tool available to build his defense, raising the specter of a trial that "could go on forever and ever." A1
 
Throughout the day, the partisanship that wracked the House seemed to be infecting the Senate. A15

HEADLINE: Boeing Received Orders for 656 Planes in '98

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
The Boeing Company, the world's leading commercial aircraft maker, announced last night that it had received orders for 656 planes in 1998, 15 percent more than the 568 ordered a year earlier.
But the value of the 1998 orders totaled $42.1 billion, compared with $42.8 billion in 1997, because the company sold more narrow-body jets last year, which are less expensive than its wide-body models. 
 It was also unclear whether Boeing's orders for 1998 surpassed those of Airbus Industrie, its only rival in the commercial aircraft business.
The European consortium, which is to release 1998 production and delivery figures on Monday, had more than 500 orders as of the end of November.
Hurt by the economic slump in Asia and a litany of production and delivery problems, Boeing sought to put the best face on its annual production and delivery data. In a news release hours after the stock market had closed, Boeing said the figures showed it "continued to increase its presence in the worldwide fleet in 1998, delivering more than two of every three commercial airlines of 100 seats or more."
Although Boeing releases airplane orders monthly, the figures released last night are the most comprehensive for the year and include some previously unannounced orders.
But the figures also illustrate that while the company's order backlog remains healthy, fewer customers are purchasing its most expensive and profitable airplanes.
The Seattle-based company said it expected to deliver a record 620 aircraft in 1999, surpassing the record of 563 last year.
Boeing also said it has delivered nearly 12,500 commercial jets, accounting for about three of every four jets in service.
Boeing was hampered by production problems throughout 1998. Late last year it said it expected to trim 48,000 of its 233,000 employees worldwide through 1999.
Its share price, which hit a 1998 high of $50 in July, has traded as low as $30.875. It closed yesterday at $35.8125 cents, down 25 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.

Stock Market Recovers From an Early Deep Plunge
Stocks retreated from record levels but then rallied in the afternoon and finished little changed in a session marked by some warnings of profit shortfalls and a mildly negative reappraisal by Abby Joseph Cohen of Goldman, Sachs, one of Wall Street's most prominent strategists.
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 7.21 points, to 9,537,76, after being down as much as 118.95 points. The Nasdaq market rose 5.23 points, to 2,326.09, its fifth record in a row. The S.& P. 500 fell 2.61 points, to 1,269.73. Ms. Cohen revised her recommended portfolio mix, to 70 percent in stocks from 72 percent and to 12 percent in higher-yielding corporate bonds from 10 percent. Page C5.

Stocks Take A Wild Rise To New Highs

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The stock market took a volatile ride to new highs yesterday, finishing a week marked by an Internet stock frenzy, a surge in other technology stocks and new economic data that showed the American economy is refusing, so far, to slow down.
The Dow Jones industrial average, which seesawed all day, rallied in the late afternoon to gain 105.56 points, or 1.1 percent, closing at a record 9,643.32. 
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 5.36 points, or four-tenths of 1 percent, to 1,275.09. The technology-heavy Nasdaq index climbed 18.32 points, or eight-tenths of 1 percent, to 2,344.41. Both were also records.
While some of the highfliers of the technology sector, including Microsoft, Dell Computer, I.B.M. and Netscape Communications, slipped yesterday, the overall sector rose, lead by Cisco Systems and its promise of a new voice and data modem. The broader market was paced by Alcoa, which accounted for about one-third of the Dow's surge, after the company announced better-than-expected earnings, a stock split and a dividend increase. The S.& P. 500's performance was held back by declines in drug and consumer stocks, including Pfizer, Eli Lilly and Coca-Cola.
The Internet frenzy cost some investors a lot of money yesterday. Amazon.com surged 40 1/4, or 25.3 percent, to 199 1/8, and then gave up almost all its gains, finishing up 1 3/8 at 160 1/4. E*Trade, was up 10 13/16, or 16.9 percent, to 74 7/8, before giving back all but 3 9/16 of the day's gain. Still, for the first week of the year Amazon.com was up 49.7 percent and E*Trade 44.6 percent.
"Today was a good indication of why you have to be pretty careful," said Henry Blodget, senior analyst at CBIC Oppenheimer. "These stocks are incredibly volatile. They have spiked here massively and if your time horizon is longer than five minutes you are taking an inordinate amount of risk buying in at this level."
For some, the technology rally is creating a worrisome two-tier market. Douglas R. Cliggott, United States equity strategist at J. P. Morgan Securities, is positive on technology stocks but concerned about the rest of the market. "We are getting real close to the levels of overvaluation we had in July of last year," he said. "While we are real enthusiastic about tech, we are recommending caution about the rest of the market."
He argued that the tech rally, not including the Internet mania, is powered by several credible forces. One is the improvement in expected demand for computer products since last August. Another is the billions of dollars of cash that portfolio managers and retail investors have on hand to invest. The third is that technology stocks seem to fit nicely into the two possible economic outlooks for this year. In one, the economy slows and interest rates fall but the key technology stocks still produce healthy earnings. In the other, the economy fools most forecasters and does not slow. Technology stocks are perfect here also, Mr. Cliggott said.
The increase of 378,000 nonfarm payroll jobs in December reported yesterday by the Labor Department supports the idea that the economy remains stubbornly strong, despite many forecasts of a slowdown. The job growth was far stronger than the 200,000 consensus forecast.
While the news was welcomed in the stock market, it contributed to weakness in the bond market, where evidence of economic strength often hurts prices. The Treasury's 30-year issue lost 21/32, to 99 24/32; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 5.27 percent from 5.22 percent -- its highest in nearly two months.
For the week the Dow was up 5 percent. However, for the last four weeks, the Dow was up 9.3 percent while the S.& P. 500 was up 9.3 percent. And the Nasdaq beat both, rising 15.5 percent.
But the real sign of the market's torrid pace -- and why a breather may be in store -- was the surge since the lows in 1998. The Nasdaq was up 65.2 percent since its Oct. 8 low, while the Dow gained 27.9 percent since Aug. 31 and the S.& P. 500 advanced 33.2 percent since the same date.
But the story of the week was Amazon.com, On Tuesday, it announced that it still had not made a penny in profit. In fact, losses are expected to rise to 18 cents a share in the fourth quarter report, three times the losses a year ago.
That makes no difference, apparently to investors. They are betting the on-line book and music seller is going to be a big winner in the future.
So all they cared about in Tuesday's announcement was the projection that fourth-quarter sales would jump to $250 million, well above forecasts of $175 million.
But those who got in last year have nothing but profits. From the bottom of the technology selloff on Oct. 8, the Nasdaq 100 index, which includes the biggest of the technology heavyweights, has soared 74.8 percent. But Amazon.com was up 457.8 percent.
"The frenetic buying of Internet stocks is going to make the tulip buyers of the 17th century look like value players," said Rick Berry, director of equity research at J. P. Turner & Company in Atlanta.

Sinking in Buoyant Waters

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 8

 BODY:
Even while the stock market hits new highs, a crucial indicator of foreign confidence in the United States Government and its economy -- the dollar -- has been falling. No one can agree why.
By all the normal measures, it should not be happening. The American economy remains remarkably strong -- President Clinton today was hailing the longest peacetime economic expansion in the 20th century. The huge budget deficit that once was blamed for undercutting the dollar has turned into a surplus that is estimated to hit $76 billion this year. Inflation is practically nonexistent. 
 Yet investors are flocking to the Japanese yen. The dollar has fallen nearly 25 percent against the yen since August even as every indicator suggests Japan will remain the basket case of the world's major economies in 1999.
Last summer the dollar was trading around 145 yen, and many American officials feared it would rise to 160, to the enormous detriment of American exporters. Instead, it was trading around 120 yen by mid-December and bounced around 110 yen this week. What has changed in the fundamentals that are supposed to govern currencies over the long term? Very little.
The dollar did better against European currencies, but it is nonetheless down about 6 percent over the same period against the German mark.
So what is causing all this? It depends on whom you ask, and where they live. Here in the United States some say the cause is the swelling trade deficit. Others say it is the enthusiasm for the euro, the single currency that was introduced this week by 11 European nations. Even though the euro has fallen slightly against the dollar, it seems to be clearly on the way to establishing itself as the world's No. 2 currency. Still others say the dollar's decline is a byproduct of Japan's latest act of financial desperation, an unexpected increase in interest rates that appears to be drawing investors back to Japan, even if many fear the higher rates will further slow Japan's economy.
Ask foreigners, though, and many say the answer is being beamed around the globe 24 hours a day: the impeachment trial of President Clinton. "It's what I hear from friends and clients all over the world," said Sung Won Sohn, the chief economist at the Norwest Corporation. "They see the chief executive of the world's greatest power going on trial and equate it to what would happen if that was occurring in their own country. And they conclude, rightly or wrongly, that the U.S. will not be able to provide leadership if things get dicey again."
Just this week, HSBC Securities, part of the HongKong and Shanghai Bank group, warned investors in a report to keep an eye on "political stability" in Washington. It notes that the market calculus is that Mr. Clinton will stay in office -- but of course the market calculus is based on the conventional wisdom blaring from television sets. And the conventional wisdom has been notably wrong at almost every major turn in the last year of handicapping the Washington scandal.
"The quick fix is not likely to be so quick," HSBC concluded, "and the odds could change as well."
To many Americans an impeachment explanation for the dollar's troubles seems outright ridiculous. But the fact of the matter, says Robert Hormats, the vice chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Company, is that "there is no wholly rational explanation for this."
As always when currencies lurch in one direction or another, the effects are complex and unpredictable. Some of the decline may simply be a feeling that the sharp rise in the dollar over the previous couple of years had gone too far. American farmers, steelmakers and some big manufacturers have been complaining for over a year that a strong dollar, combined with the collapse of most Asian economies, was killing their business abroad and undermining their efforts to compete with cheap imports. For them a weakening of the dollar is welcome news -- and it perhaps partly explains the stock market's recent surge.
Today the dollar settled at 110.93 yen, down from 111.04 Thursday. It was up slightly against the euro, which fell to $1.15540 from $1.16700.
Still, no one seems to be celebrating at the United States Treasury. There, sharp fluctuations in currencies are viewed as one of the volatile fuels that have fired 18 months of global instability. The countries that linked their currencies to the dollar -- chiefly Thailand and South Korea -- could not sustain the connection as the dollar strengthened, making their products less and less competitive abroad.
Just because a rising dollar was bad news in 1997, though, it doesn't follow that a weakening dollar is necessarily good news in 1999. The world has changed a lot since then.
More than ever, the ground zero of the world's economic troubles is Japan. A bad year for Japan could mean a bad year for the rest of Asia, because there will be no engine of regional growth. And the strengthening of the yen is grim news for Japan's exports -- the best hope Japan has of limping back to growth by the end of this year.
So in a strange way, the Clinton Administration finds itself as worried about what a weak dollar means for Japan as what it means for America.
"We're in this odd position," one senior Administration official said this week. "What looks like good news for us could in fact turn out to be pretty troublesome for the world."
The unresolved question is whether the fall of the dollar and the rise of the yen says more about what investors around the world are thinking about America, or what they are thinking about Japan.
Mr. Sung noted that "America is saving less and less, and that is leading to some pessimism, and it doesn't look like the current account will be turning around soon." The current account is the broadest measure of financial flows.
Also, the talk of declining profits later this year clearly has many investors around the world spooked. These factors, combined with the political uncertainties of impeachment, create nervousness about the champion economy of the 1990's.
But perhaps the more mystifying change of perception concerns Japan.
The country's economic outlook is hardly improved; the best prognosis calls for 1999 to be a lot like 1998. But in one of those oddities that has peppered the Asian financial crisis, interest rates in Japan, which have been at rock bottom, are going up. And that may be luring money back into the country.
The rates are going up because the Japanese Government is issuing bonds with unaccustomed abandon, to finance a growing deficit as it tries to stimulate the economy. The higher rates -- combined with the cuts in American rates several months ago -- have narrowed the previously huge gap between Treasury bonds and Japan's offerings.
More surprising, Japanese officials seem to be encouraging the rising yen. Earlier this week Eisuke Sakakibara, the Finance Ministry official once known as Mr. Yen for his ability to move the markets (an ability that has waned), referred to the American stock market as "bubble like." Mr. Sakakibara has expressed that view many times before, making the argument that the United States today looks like Japan in 1989.
But perhaps Japan's top motivation for tolerating a high yen, no matter the damage it does, is political. The embrace of the euro confirmed a Japanese nightmare -- that years of weakness have undermined the yen's role as the world's second currency. So Japan's politicians, led by Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, are circling the globe this week talking about a currency triumvirate -- the dollar, the euro, the yen. To make that stick, there needs to be a strong yen, not a weak one.

HEADLINE: The Scale of Mr. Trump's Dreams

 BODY:
The normally loquacious Donald Trump has quietly amassed enough real estate and air rights to build an 861-foot-high skyscraper near the United Nations. What he touts as the world's tallest apartment project is too lanky, even for the architectural mishmash of Manhattan's East 40's. His bronze-glass monolith, the equivalent of 90 stories, would dwarf the 39-story U.N. Secretariat and its waterfront park. The project should be scaled back. But for the moment, Mr. Trump appears well positioned to put his signature on New York's skyline anew since his project is as-of-right, or not subject to extensive public review.
The project's legal pedigree does not mean the Giuliani administration should remain on the sidelines. As-of-right status shields a project from a full public review of its impact on air, light and traffic and from assessing wind shear and shadows. But City Hall may have grounds to scale it back, and the Planning Commission can forestall a recurrence. 
 City Hall should review the Buildings Department's approval of Mr. Trump's use of zoning rules that are as tough to decipher as Sanskrit. The agency found that the way he assembled air rights across zoning district boundaries fell within a mid-1980's exception to the ban on such mergers in the city's 1961 zoning code. At issue is whether Mr. Trump merely took maximum advantage of the rules, or flexed them. It should not require months for the city to review whether that judgment was reasonable and in line with how developers operate.
The far thornier task of safeguarding the city's skyline and its neighborhoods falls to the Planning Commission. It should revise the antediluvian zoning code to prohibit any developer from exploiting air rights, plaza bonuses and other zoning tools to create a structure that does not fit the scale of a neighborhood, while allowing reasonable use of air rights to save landmarks, help neighborhoods and promote economic development. Such zoning decisions must remain the province of city government, not neighborhoods or developers.
A Trump executive thinks his boss's project will someday be lauded as a landmark. But Mr. Trump's musings suggest an awareness of the mismatch between the building's scale and the U.N. environs. He said he believed that, had he boasted about his goal before buying the site and air rights, zoning would have been altered to stop him. His intuition should galvanize City Hall and the commission.

HEADLINE: Zalman C. Bernstein, 72, Iconoclastic Broker

BYLINE: By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr. 

 BODY:
When he started a securities firm under his own name in 1967, Sanford Charles Bernstein made sure that hurried investors would not fail to notice. To announce the firm, the 41-year-old upstart ran a series of full-page newspaper ads emphasizing in bold, black type a single word: "Bernstein."
The display of hubris drew a wave of titters. The titters turned to gasps when the Brooklyn-born Mr. Bernstein topped himself with a demonstration of chutzpah that is still reverberating on Wall Street. 
 At the time, so-called discretionary accounts, in which a broker makes all the investment decisions without consulting the client, were such an industry scandal that the New York Stock Exchange imposed strict controls and many old-line brokers banned them altogether. But Mr. Bernstein announced that he would seek nothing but discretionary accounts.
Given the potential for abuse by unscrupulous brokers tempted to churn accounts by buying and selling, collecting fees with each transaction, Wall Street laughed off Mr. Bernstein's chances for attracting serious investors.
By the time he died on Wednesday at 72 at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Mr. Bernstein had long since had the last laugh.
His brokerage had grown into one of the world's largest independent investment companies, managing more than $80 billion in securities for 25,000 private and institutional clients, and Sanford C. Bernstein & Company had become one of the most respected names on Wall Street -- even as Mr. Bernstein, true to his contrarian ways, had changed his own name.
To honor a late-life surge of interest in his Jewish heritage and his conversion to Orthodox Judaism, he had moved to Jerusalem, established dual American-Israeli citizenship and replaced his "Sanford" and "Charles" with rough Hebrew equivalents, becoming Zalman Chaim Bernstein.
It took more than hubris and chutzpah to make Sanford C. Bernstein & Company a runaway success.
By the time he started the company, Mr. Bernstein had already made something of a name for himself. After enlisting in the Navy at 18 and becoming a Supply Corps officer in World War II, he studied economics and accounting at New York University, picked up a master's degree in business administration at Harvard and spent three years with the Marshall Plan in Europe. He returned to the United States with a French wife and such driving ambition that when the Value Line Investment Survey turned him down for a job, he won one anyway by offering to work without pay.
He later worked as a research analyst, money manager and institutional salesman at Oppenheimer & Company and then spent two years as a partner in a small securities firm, Ralph E. Samuel & Company, before striking off on his own. At first his younger brother, Paul, was his sole partner and he had a total of just seven employees, including his father, Jack, a retired jeweler.
His vision of a firm that would give comparatively small investors the benefits of professional money management was so novel, his brother recalled yesterday, that the Harvard Business School sent a team of student researchers to study the operation. They concluded that the approach was sound but wouldn't work for a Jewish firm.
They were half right. Within a decade, the firm was attracting huge investments from major insurance companies, banks and pension funds and had become known for the exhaustive research reports it sold as a sideline.
Ever the iconoclast, Mr. Bernstein shunned the prevailing system of star portfolio managers and adopted the so-called dividend discount investment model, which bases investment decisions on a formula for determining the value of a company's future earnings.
Since the formula depends on the accuracy of earnings projections, Mr. Bernstein concentrated on the quality of the company's research.
A big, gruff and sometimes unpolished man who wielded a mean cigar, Mr. Bernstein became famous for the pains he took in hiring, putting applicants through a battery of psychological and other tests and sometimes playing backgammon or chess with them to gauge their stomach for competition and cigar smoke.
The rewards of his efforts were considerable for Mr. Bernstein, who continued to be his company's largest shareholder after his retirement in 1993. But he lived modestly after he accepted the warm embrace of the close-knit Orthodox community, and he gave hundreds of millions of dollars to Israeli causes and other charities.
His family said that he died from complications of lymphoma. In addition to his brother, who lives in Manhattan, Mr. Bernstein, who was married three times, is survived by his mother, Martha, of Manhattan; his wife, Mem; a son, Claude, of New Canaan, Conn.; two daughters, Leslie Armstrong and Rochel Leah Bernstein, both of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Growth in Consumer Borrowing Less Than Expected in November

BYLINE: Bloomberg News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 8

 BODY:
Borrowing by American consumers increased more slowly than had been expected in November, rising by $3.9 billion, to a total of $1.301 trillion, according to figures released today by the Federal Reserve Board. Analysts had expected an increase of $5.5 billion.
The rate of new borrowing is down from October, when consumer borrowing rose $11.9 billion, according to revised figures. 
 An increase in auto loans in November more than offset a drop in credit card borrowing. Revolving loans, which include credit cards, decreased $700 million in November, after rising $4.6 billion in October. But auto loans rose $4.3 billion, after increasing $2 billion in October.
Other types of installment loans increased $200 million after rising $5.2 billion in October.
Consumer borrowing was rising at a 3.6 percent annual rate during November, down from 11 percent in October.
The unexpectedly low borrowing in November could point to a decline in the rate of consumer spending from last year, said Astrid Adolfson, an economist at MCM Moneywatch in New York. Or, analysts said, borrowing could be declining because the strong economy, with plentiful jobs and rising incomes, strengthened household finances.
But it is also possible that consumer borrowing may actually be rising, but in ways that are not measured by the Federal Reserve's report. With mortgage rates low, consumers have been refinancing homes and taking out home equity loans, which typically carry lower interest rates than credit card borrowing.

Asian Stocks Take a Rest From a Dizzying Rally

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Jan. 8

 BODY:
The bulls finally stopped stampeding across Asia today, after a week of powerful gains in stock markets from Seoul to Singapore. Analysts seemed almost relieved, since many were alarmed by the growing disparity between the rising markets and Asia's still-sinking economies.
Several experts here worry that the region could face a jolting retrenchment when investors eventually stop for a reality check. 
 "We certainly don't think this rally will extend beyond the second quarter," said Michael M. Sargent, the head of Asia-Pacific equity research at Salomon Smith Barney in Hong Kong. "Asia hasn't had its day of reckoning yet."
Today, stock markets here registered a mixture of modest gains and losses. The relative calm came after a dizzying week in which investors behaved as though the Asian crisis was a memory. Emboldened by record-setting gains in the United States and a stronger Japanese yen, they poured money into shares in Hong Kong, Seoul, Jakarta, Singapore, Taipei and Manila.
In Tokyo, the Nikkei index declined by 1.1 percent today, the second consecutive day of losses. Some analysts said the retreat reflected a recognition that the region's markets were out of sync with the underlying economies.
In most of Asia, investors have barely paused to catch their breath since shares first began moving up in September. The region's markets have sustained the rally in the face of a relentless stream of dismal economic news, a situation that has left economists and portfolio managers here baffled.
"I'm really ready to throw in the towel and say, 'Nothing matters anymore but positive investor sentiment,' " said Mac Overton, a portfolio manager at MBF Unit Trust in Hong Kong. "The stock market has continued to increase despite three straight quarters of lower corporate earnings."
Mr. Overton noted that in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index rose even after China issued an unexpectedly bleak prognosis for its economy in 1999. The Chinese Government said that lackluster demand would weaken its domestic economy, while the regional crisis would cause its exports to falter.
"The negative implications of these problems for this year's economic performance should not be underestimated," the Government said.
How did Hong Kong, which depends so heavily on China, react to the warning? Investors drove the Hang Seng 4.5 percent higher on Thursday and a further three-tenths of a percent today. Analysts said shareholders disregarded the news from China and instead pinned their hopes on a cut in local interest rates.
After trading ended today, the Hong Kong Association of Banks announced that it would lower its benchmark short-term savings deposit rate to 4 percent from 4.25 percent. Some analysts said the announcement might disappoint investors, who had been expecting a deeper reduction.
In Jakarta, investors were distracted from Indonesia's continuing economic calamity by a new state budget proposed by President B. J. Habibie. Unlike previous budgets, Mr. Habibie's proposal, economists said, represented a realistic plan to deal with Indonesia's stagnant economy, spiraling inflation and weak currency.
Beyond these local factors, experts noted that Asia's stock markets were now largely propelled by such external forces as rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in the United States and the strengthening Japanese yen.
"The turnaround of the yen has been a big help for the rest of Asia," said Dong Tao, a regional strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston in Hong Kong. "It has reduced the risk of currency volatility in the rest of Asia, which has allowed markets like Hong Kong to cut their own interest rates."
Yet some analysts wonder how much more Asian countries can rely on rate cuts to jump-start their economies. In the last three months, Hong Kong has cut rates five times, Singapore three times and Thailand more than a dozen times. Even with low rates in Thailand, economists said the Government had not been able to reignite consumer demand or corporate investment.
Moreover, many experts doubt that the Japanese yen will maintain its strength. The yen has been bolstered in recent days by the introduction of the euro, which has diverted some investment capital from the United States to Europe. Late today, the yen traded at roughly 110 yen to the dollar. That makes the yen about 26 percent more valuable than in early August, when it traded at a nearly eight-year low of 147.66. But Mr. Sargent predicted that as the novelty of the euro wore off -- and the extent of Japan's economic ills re-emerged -- the yen would resume its downward spiral, reaching 140 to the dollar by late summer.
To some experts, the most damaging potential side effect of the rally is that it could breed complacency on the part of Asian governments, prompting them to delay or scrap needed economic changes.
"Legislators and decision makers may conclude that they don't have to act," said Jim Walker, chief economist of CLSA Global Emerging Markets in Edinburgh. "People could start to think the stock market is a precursor to a genuine recovery, and that's just wrong."
Mr. Walker noted that the Japanese stock market experienced a similar rebound after Japan's economic collapse in 1989 and 1990. Several months later, after Tokyo failed to deal with the country's growing financial crisis, the Nikkei reversed and plunged to new lows.
"We're into uncharted waters here because Japan was running huge budget surpluses before its crisis," Mr. Walker said. "I don't think the clock will keep ticking as long for the rest of Asia as it did for Japan."

HEADLINE: HIRING LAST MONTH KEPT A BRISK PACE

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

 BODY:
Despite an unsettled global economy, lower corporate profits and a new round of layoffs, the American economy keeps creating jobs at an astonishing pace.
In December, the number of workers on payrolls grew by 378,000, the biggest gain in more than a year, the Labor Department reported yesterday. The unemployment rate edged down a tenth of a point from November, to 4.3 percent, matching the 28-year low set in April. 
 The last time unemployment was this low for any significant period was in 1969 during the height of the Vietnam War. The last time it was this low in peacetime was in 1957 when the first baby boomers were in the fifth grade and Dwight Eisenhower was in the White House.
The report contributed to another big rally on Wall Street, where major stock indexes finished at record highs. Page C1.
The December job results were helped by balmy weather in the North and East, which postponed the construction layoffs usual for that time of year. Further, a few statistical flukes probably inflated the figures a bit.
But signs of strength were impressive and widespread, reflecting robust spending by consumers and home buyers, who account for nearly three-fourths of economic activity. Among job seekers, the most disadvantaged groups -- blacks and teenagers -- had the biggest gains, and wage increases were strongest among the lowest-paid workers.
"If the economy is an eight-cylinder car, it's running on nine,' said David Blitzer, chief economist at the Standard & Poor's Corporation. "A little may be special factors like weather, but there's a lot of strength there."
The job market strength, which shows that the widely anticipated economic slowdown has yet to happen, caught forecasters off guard. After a wave of corporate layoff announcements and a surge in first-time claims for unemployment insurance in the last half of December, economists had expected job growth to weaken and unemployment to edge up.
Even President Clinton's chief economic adviser, Janet L. Yellen, acknowledged that she was amazed by the economy's momentum. "I'm surprised; it's great; it's just extraordinary," she said. "There's no obvious reason we can't continue down this path."
The President, speaking in Detroit, took credit for the economy's performance and for the 93-month-old expansion, now the longest in peacetime, though still more than a year shy of the record set by the 1960's expansion. Mr. Clinton called this a time "of American renaissance."
The December data capped a year in which -- contrary to predictions of fewer jobs, rising unemployment and stagnant incomes -- net job growth was nearly three million; unemployment hovered between 4.3 and 4.5 percent; wage gains, adjusted for inflation, were the best in a generation, and productivity growth picked up instead of slowing as it usually does as economic expansions age.
Moreover, some of the most disadvantaged workers have enjoyed substantial job and pay gains in the last two years. In December, for example, while the jobless rate for most major demographic groups was largely unchanged, the unemployment rates for black workers and teen-agers, typically multiples of the white and adult rates, dropped sharply. "We're finally back to the kind of tide that lifts all boats," Ms. Yellen said.
Most economists are still predicting a sharp slowdown in 1999 starting in the current quarter, although at least one acknowledged yesterday that there was scant evidence of that so far. Along with recent data showing that retail sales, home buying and car purchases remained strong through the end of the year, yesterday's jobs report suggested that the economy might have been expanding at a 4 percent annual rate in the final quarter of 1998, which is considered exceptionally strong.
Gail Fosler, chief economist at the Conference Board, a private research organization, said, "We're going into 1999 with fundamentals better than in 1998."
There are good reasons for expecting some moderation of growth, though. Much of the rest of the world is either in recession or slowing down. Consumers have been spending much of their income at an unsustainable rate. Home buying is at a record pace.
Still, economists say job growth would have to fall below a rate of 100,000 or so a month for unemployment to start rising.
Factory employment, which fell during most of last year, declined by another 13,000 jobs in December. But that is a fraction of the losses in recent months. Factory employment has fallen by 272,000 jobs since March, as recessions in Asia and Latin America have hurt American exports. Despite record car sales, employment in Detroit is down 12,000 from a year earlier. On the other hand, manufacturers of anything related to the housing market -- from bricks and glass to furniture and hardware -- continue to thrive and did plenty of hiring last month, as they have done all year.
Weather was partly responsible for construction jobs surging by 104,000 last month, the biggest monthly gain since February 1984. Most of the gains were in outdoor work like highway construction and roofing as contractors were able to continue working longer than usual. But construction hiring has been strong all year. With state treasuries bulging and mortgage rates down to the lowest level in 30 years, public works and housing are both booming.
The main engine of job growth remained the service economy -- everything from fast-food chains to schools -- which added 290,000 jobs. Business services like public relations, consulting and computing did extensive hiring. Temporary-help suppliers had the biggest jump in head counts since August. With companies and government agencies scrambling to fix their Year 2000 computer problems, hiring by computer services companies was brisk; jobs in that industry swelled by more than 13 percent in 1998.
Jobs in the retail industry rose by 53,000 in December, bringing total gains for the year to nearly half a million. Restaurants added 33,000 workers. Department stores hired a lot of extra holiday help. A surge in renovation helped building-material and garden-supply stores add 9,000 jobs, the biggest increase of the year. Most services related to the building business expanded payrolls last year.
With workers in such demand, paychecks are fattening. Hourly earnings jumped 5 cents, to $12.98. That is a 3.8 percent gain for the year.

HEADLINE: THE TRIAL OF THE PRESIDENT: THE PRESIDENT;
Economy, Long a Friend, Brings Clinton More Help

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 8

 BODY:
The stock market is in record territory. The economic expansion just hit its 93d month, making this the longest peacetime period of sustained growth in American history.
And if President Clinton needed any more reason to be upbeat when he stepped before the Economic Club of Detroit today, he got it this morning when the Labor Department announced that the economy generated a startling total of 378,000 new jobs in December, pushing the unemployment rate down to 4.3 percent. 
 As the Senate moved forward in its impeachment trial, the confluence of good economic news was just another reminder that this President remains either the most skillful overseer of the economy in decades, or the luckiest. If he escapes removal from office, it will be in no small part because of his high approval ratings, which are rooted in the nation's long run of prosperity.
How much of the credit Mr. Clinton deserves is of course a matter of debate. But he was not shy about claiming some today as he spoke to 1,500 members and guests of the Economic Club of Detroit, including hundreds of automobile industry executives and auto union leaders and most of Michigan's Democratic Congressional delegation.
"We meet today at a time of an American economic renaissance," Mr. Clinton declared.
He said the current expansion was more impressive than past ones for several reasons, among them that it had brought not only higher real incomes for most Americans but also minority unemployment rates that are at the lowest levels since the Government began keeping those statistics in 1972.
"This is a rising tide that is lifting all boats," Mr. Clinton said.
The President spoke at Cobo Arena, site of the North American International Auto Show, the world's largest new-car exhibit, which he toured beforehand. The automobile industry is celebrating its second-best sales year ever, and the region's economy is booming.
The White House, clearly recognizing how important the national economy's performance is to Mr. Clinton's survival in office, is making certain he is seen presiding over announcements of the good news.
On Wednesday, he announced that the Administration expected a Federal budget surplus of at least $76 billion in the current fiscal year, the highest such figure ever in terms of absolute dollars (as opposed to percentage of the budget). And today he braved snowy runways in both Washington and Detroit to spotlight the latest favorable trends.
White House aides insist that these are not events stage-managed solely to divert attention from the impeachment trial.
"The President obviously understands what's going on in the Senate," said Joe Lockhart, the White House press secretary. "It's in the hands of the Senate. He's focusing on his agenda."
In his 35-minute address this afternoon, Mr. Clinton said that despite the steady flow of favorable developments, the Government still faced challenges in dealing with economic matters. He said the Administration must still grapple with caring for the elderly and providing an education to equip the nation's young to compete in the global high-technology economy. He said many inner cities and rural areas had yet to share in the benefits of the economic boom.
He also said the huge volume and high speed of international capital flows posed a threat to the stability of nations around the world, whose problems could spread to the United States. And he noted that rapid growth posed environmental problems that, he said, must be met with new investment in energy-efficient technology and a reduced dependence on fossil fuels, which contribute to global warming.
Many of the Economic Club's members are Republicans, but they too appeared focused mostly on the economy and said they wanted the President's impeachment difficulties over as soon as possible. One big donor to Michigan Republicans, Heinz Prechter, chairman and founder of ASC Inc., a manufacturer of car sunroofs, said that while he was uncertain whether Mr. Clinton should be removed from office, he was sure that the current political furor should be brought to a quick conclusion.
"I don't think that most of us in leadership positions can condone what President Clinton has done," Mr. Prechter said, "but we can't have this public show go on forever."
Having finished his formal remarks, the President took several questions from the audience, screened by his host, Dennis Archer, Mayor of Detroit and Mr. Clinton's choice to be co-chairman of the Democratic National Committee.
If anyone in the audience wanted Mr. Clinton's views on the impeachment trial playing out in Washington, they were disappointed. The questions he took concerned alleged dumping of steel by Japan, Russia and Brazil (he is against it), the new Europe-wide currency, the euro (he is for it), and increased spending on the military (he is for it, to a point).
The final question came from a 12-year-old, who wanted to know the person Mr. Clinton had met as President whom he most admired. Mr. Clinton named Yitzhak Rabin, the assassinated Israeli Prime Minister, and Nelson Mandela, human rights hero and President of South Africa.
Outside the hall where Mr. Clinton spoke was a small congress of demonstrators.
One held a sign reading, "It's the perjury, stupid," a play on the slogan that gained currency within Mr. Clinton's 1992 campaign team, "It's the economy, stupid." Another sign proclaimed, "Impeach, Indict, Incarcerate."
But there were pro-Clinton demonstrators as well, one of whom held a placard reading, "G.O.P.: Get Our President."

Economy Rewards Workers With a Boom in U.S. Jobs
Despite an unsettled global economy, lower corporate profits and a new round of layoffs, the American economy kept creating jobs at an astonishing pace in December, adding about 378,000 new positions. Unemployment fell to 4.3 percent, matching the 28-year low set last April. Signs of strength in the economy were impressive and widespread, showing healthy gains in employment and wages among disadvantaged demographic groups.
For 1998 as a whole, net job growth was nearly 3 million and unemployment hovered between 4.3 and 4.5 percent. Except for a period at the height of the Vietnam War, the last time unemployment was this low for any significant length of time was in 1957. Page A1. 

American consumers scaled back their rate of borrowing in November, adding $3.9 billion in new debt, the Federal Reserve reported, compared with $11.9 billion in October. Revolving loans, which include credit card borrowing, decreased, but auto loans rose sharply. C3.
 
Hyundai Plans to Sell Divisions
Hyundai Group, South Korea's largest conglomerate, said it would sell 11 of its affiliates in an effort to raise more than $5 billion. Hyundai, the largest of the giant family-dominated conglomerates, called chaebol, that dominate the nation's economy is under pressure from the Government to lower its debt, now estimated at $36 billion. C2.
 
Disney Recalls a Video Release
Disney recalled 3.4 million copies of the animated video "The Rescuers," apparently because a nude image was inserted. The image cannot be seen when the video is run at normal speed. A Disney spokeswoman would say only that the image was objectionable, but there were reports that the unauthorized insertion was a photo of a woman's nude torso. C3.
 
F.A.A. Orders Tests on Planes
The Federal Aviation Administration issued an emergency order for special tests on Embraer 145's, Brazilian-built regional jets heavily used by some U.S. airlines, and Cessna 750's, which are business jets. The order followed three instances of engine shutdowns because of suspected oil leaks. A8.

Wild Day for Broadcast.com Shares
Trading of shares in Broadcast.com, a Dallas Internet company, was stopped temporarily yesterday on the Nasdaq stock market after the stock had jumped more than 70 percent in value by 11:51 A.M. Trading resumed at 1:20 P.M. even though the company declined to comment on what might have caused the surge. The stock opened at $132, rose to a high of $230.50, and closed at $197.50, up $65.50 for the day. C2.
 
MCI Worldcom Won't Buy Airtouch
MCI Worldcom said that it had decided not to pursue a bid for Airtouch, the nation's leading wireless telephone company. Airtouch has been in merger talks with Bell Atlantic, the nation's largest local phone concern, which wants to buy the company in a stock deal valued at about $45 billion. Vodafone Group PLC, a British wireless carrier, has also proposed buying Airtouch, suggesting a deal worth $54 billion in cash and securities. C14.
 
Lucent Predicts a One-Time Gain Lucent Technologies, a maker of telecommunications equipment, predicted a one-time gain of 97 cents a share in the its first quarter, which ended Dec. 31. The gain reflects an accounting change that better represents benefit expenses. C3
 
Cuba Scoffs at Easing of Sanctions
In the first official Cuban reaction to President Clinton's decision on Monday to ease a few elements of the United States' economic embargo against Cuba, Jose Luis Rodriguez, Cuba's Economy Minister, dismissed Mr. Clinton's changes as "crumbs." The President had said American companies would be permitted to sell food and farm supplies to nongovernmental organizations in Cuba. Most elements of the sanctions would remain unchanged. A5.

In Bow to Reality, N.B.A. Allows Talks With Agents

BYLINE: By MIKE WISE

 BODY:
Fearing a mad scramble for free agents three weeks before the season is scheduled to begin, the National Basketball Association agreed yesterday to permit teams to negotiate with player agents immediately.
From Michael Jordan to Zan Tabak, the decision opens the floodgates for nearly 200 players to negotiate new contracts through their agents. No deals can be signed until the new collective bargaining agreement is set in writing sometime next week. And the moratorium for players having contact with teams remains in effect until training camps are scheduled to begin Jan. 18. 
But the cloak-and-dagger methods of many agents and team executives will end this weekend.
After consulting with the union, and aware that talks were already secretly going on after Wednesday's settlement that saved the season, the league sent memorandums to the 29 teams about 5 P.M. yesterday advising them that negotiations could proceed.
"There was obviously such pent-up demand that it wasn't worth fighting about," one league official said on condition of anonymity.
Jordan has yet to decide whether he will retire, but a free-agent class that includes Antonio McDyess, Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman, Damon Stoudamire and Jayson Williams is about to experience the N.B.A.'s version of Job Fair '99, replete with the usual inducements and recruiting tactics from prospective employers.
One agent, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Nets were keenly interested in acquiring McDyess, the skywalking forward whose youth and athleticism make him perhaps the No. 1 commodity. But it will be almost impossible for the Nets to acquire a player of that caliber under the new $30 million salary cap.
Phoenix and Denver, teams McDyess has played for, were also in the bidding, as was Houston. The Nets are planning to keep Williams.
Jimmy Sexton, Pippen's agent, said there was a possibility his client would return to the Chicago Bulls when the 50-game, lockout-delayed season is scheduled to open Feb. 5.
"Scottie loves Chicago, loves the team and so, if we can work a deal out that works for Scottie, I think he would like to stay there," Sexton said.
Each team will play two preseason games, with the Knicks and the Nets playing a home-and-home series. But many teams still need players. The Bulls, Orlando Magic and Rockets have only four players apiece under contract, while the Suns have five.
Stan Kasten, the Atlanta Hawks president, told The Associated Press that he was suspicious that other teams were getting a jump on negotiations in violation of the rules. He said he had spoken with Commissioner David Stern about the situation and vowed to turn in any team that breaks the rules.
Knowing that teams and players were secretly negotiating for the past 48 hours, the league deemed the moratorium as unrealistic.
"I've got lesser guys that I need to get into camps," said Eric Rudolph, an agent who represents the free agents Johnny Newman, Kebu Stewart and Shawnelle Scott. "It just makes sense to lift the moratorium. I'd like to be able to negotiate. So now, when the 18th comes, it's like a formality of cutting their deals. A lot of g.m.'s were pushing hard for it for no other reason than they wanted to find out if a certain player was interested in their teams."
Said another agent, on condition of anonymity: "Whether they lifted it or not, I'm just telling you we've been going about business. So have a lot of other people."
Golden State is said to be trying hard to trade Latrell Sprewell, with Miami and San Antonio the most interested. The controversial All-Star guard has not played since November 1997 after choking and punching his coach, P. J. Carlesimo, and subsequently being suspended for the remainder of last season. His contract was originally terminated as well, but an arbitrator sharply reduced the penalty and allowed Sprewell to return to Golden State contractually. The Warriors have been trying to deal him since.
The season is expected to start in four weeks, and the playoffs could end in late June or early July. Charlotte is in the most trouble regarding free agents, with both centers Vlade Divac and Matt Geiger fielding offers from several teams.
But the Bulls remain the most intriguing subplot, with nine players on the open market. The feeling among most team officials is that if Jordan and Pippen somehow are retained, the club will try to sign Rodman, Steve Kerr, Bill Wennington and Luc Longley to attempt a run for a fourth consecutive title.
 With the decision yesterday, teams were, in theory, allowed to put together deals last night.
"It eliminates any need for investigation," the agent Keith Glass said. "Obviously, people have been sitting around for six months doing nothing. So it's eliminated any hypocrisy. It puts everybody on equal footing.
"I mean, I've been calling and wishing people a Happy New Year just to get a conversation going, and I think they're questioning my sincerity."
The collective bargaining agreement included salary maximums for the game's highest-paid players, eliminating the glut of $100 million deals that the owners claimed had crippled N.B.A. economics.
A player with 10 years of experience can make no more than $14 million in the first year of his deal -- with the possibility for annual 12 percent raises. With restrictions like those, some league officials said they believed that the need for agents would be reduced. Glass, for one, was not buying that theory.
"We're like city rats, we're very adaptable," he said. "We can live anywhere in any deal. We will survive. They can't exterminate us."

U.S. Ignored Threats Before Embassy Bombings
An examination of events in the year before the assaults on the American Embassies in Tanzania and Kenya shows that the security concerns of the United States Ambassador to Kenya were more intense, more well founded, more specific and more forcefully expressed than has previously been known. The Ambassador, Prudence Bushnell, had been fighting for months for a more secure embassy in the face of mounting terrorist threats and a warning that she was the target of an assassination plot. Her appeals were dismissed by the State Department. A1 

Special panels set up by the State Department to investigate the bombings of the embassies in Africa called on the department to consider closing a number of embassies around the world that are vulnerable to terrorist attack and replacing them with regional "super-embassies." A7
 
Agencies Firm on Pollard
Law enforcement and intelligence officials said they remained adamantly opposed to shortening the life sentence of Jonathan Jay Pollard, a former Navy intelligence analyst convicted of spying for Israel. But the agencies' opposition to granting Mr. Pollard leniency may not end the debate over the case, the officials said. President Clinton has the exclusive power to grant clemency, and the officials said Mr. Clinton's aides could seek to reduce Mr. Pollard's sentence or give him a release date. A3
 
Iraqi Damage Underestimated
The Pentagon's senior commanders claimed that the American and British raids on Iraq had caused more damage than initially reported. Almost three weeks after the bombing stopped, officials said they based their latest assessments on intelligence information that went beyond aerial or satellite photographs of the damage done in four nights of air and missile strikes.

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about a meeting between Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema of Italy and Pope John Paul II misidentified the archdiocese of Michele Cardinal Giordano, whose investigation by Italian law enforcement officials is a source of friction between the Vatican and the Italian Government. Cardinal Giordano is the Archbishop of Naples, not Milan. A picture caption with the article referred incorrectly to Mr. D'Alema's two children. He has a son and a daughter, not two daughters.

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY;
In New Orleans, Madame John's Legacy

BYLINE: By FRANCIS FRANK MARCUS 

 BODY:
For more than 200 years, the house at 632 Dumaine Street in New Orleans has survived fire, floods and hurricanes to become a French Quarter landmark and rare example of the classic Creole cottages built by families that settled the city in the 18th century.
After being closed for more than a decade, the small museum known in the neighborhood as Madame John's -- its official name is Madame John's Legacy -- is freshly restored and open to the public, still a model of adaptation to life in the subtropics. 
 Its design resembles the 18th-century architecture found in the French West Indies. High ceilings mitigate the stifling summer heat. The living quarters were raised from the ground to escape dampness and flooding. Tall, carefully placed windows capture breezes from the Mississippi River, which flows nearby.
The house dates to 1789, when it replaced a similar structure built in 1730 that had been ruined by a fire that destroyed most of New Orleans in 1788. In 1794 a fire that leveled much of the rebuilt city spared Madame John's Legacy. The name was taken from a book of short stories, "Old Creole Days," by George Washington Cable, who used the cottage as the setting for a melodramatic tale about a woman of mixed racial ancestry.
Madame John's Legacy was closed more than 10 years ago by the Louisiana State Museum system, which owns it, largely because of a money shortage. It reopened in November with a permanent exhibition of folk art, 70 paintings, drawings, sculptures and mixed-media pieces by self-taught Louisiana artists, donated by two New Orleans collectors, Dr. Kurt Gitter and Alice Rae Yelen, his wife. The ground floor, enclosed by thick brick walls and once used as a wine cellar, contains a series of exhibits explaining the history of the house, using reproductions of old paintings, documents and pottery found in excavations of the site. The museum, (800) 568-6968, is open 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. Tuesday to Sunday; admission is $3. FRANCES FRANK MARCUS

HEADLINE: Where Architecture Is Multilingual

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS; CLIFFORD KRAUSS is chief of the Buenos Aires bureau of The Times.

 BODY:
IF the walls of Buenos Aires could speak to me, I know they would speak in French, Italian, German, Hungarian and English.
A clock tower that is a knockoff of Big Ben tells commuters how late they are for work as they pick up their taxis at the Retiro train station, the largest Edwardian terminal in the world. Galerias Pacifico, the fashionable mall on the Calle Florida, is modeled after the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele in Milan. Entire neighborhoods, like La Boca or San Telmo, feel like blue-collar Italy; while Palermo Chico and swathes of Recoleta feel like upscale France. 
 As a new resident of Buenos Aires, I sometimes feel as though I am in the Disney World of European architecture. Only three blocks from my apartment, the Circulo Militar military club on Plaza San Martin mixes the trademarks of the chateau at Chantilly, the Luxembourg Palace in Paris, and a pavilion of the Louvre. The immense Inmaculada Concepcion church in the northern barrio of Belgrano is a copy of the Pantheon in Rome. The Teatro Colon, the epicenter of opera and ballet for all of Latin America since its inauguration in 1908, mixes the architectural styles and acoustical devices of La Scala with those of the grand opera houses of Vienna and Paris.
Unlike the ancient Indian ruins and colonial baroque churches of Mexico City or Lima, Buenos Aires architecture may seem hopelessly derivative. (Argentina was a cultural and economic backwater until the 19th century.) But you would have to travel to London, Paris, Milan, Rome, Vienna and Budapest to see all the rich derivations of European architecture that you can see in Buenos Aires alone.
Argentina's mix of styles reflects the broad impact of waves of European immigration in the 19th century (which included many distinguished architects and artisans) and the cattle and foreign-investment bonanza of the early 20th century. It financed the building of scores of lavish mansions and palaces as well as giant Government offices, shopping arcades, railroad stations and banks in the European taste. The mixing of diverse European styles in the same block, even in the same building, is as Argentine as the tango. The city's signature dance form mixes African and Latin rhythms with the tangy lyrics of lunfardo, a local slang mixing Spanish and Italian.
There are no neighborhood architectural tours in English, and all the architectural guides to the city are in Spanish. A mere inconvenience; here are three walks you can take at an easy pace over two days.
One place to begin seeing the great buildings of Buenos Aires is along the Avenida de Mayo, still the political heart of Argentina, if no longer its cultural heart. The great thoroughfare is frequently compared to the Champs-Elysees for its lasting vitality and to Budapest's Andrassy Avenue for its architectural eclecticism.
On one end of the avenue is the grand Congress building, inspired by the Reichstag in Berlin, with an imposing green dome shooting into the sky like the cupolas of Turin. On the other end of the avenue, crossing Avenida 9 de Julio, is the Casa Rosada, the presidential palace where Eva Peron stole many Argentine hearts from a balcony. The palace is graced by French mansard roofs, a grand Italian baroque central arch, and galleries of columns and arches straight out of the Italian Renaissance. And, in between, there is the Cafe Tortoni, where the poets and literati sip coffee in demitasse cups under a stained-glass skylight inspired by the one in Maxim's in Paris.
There are English-language tours of the Congress, as well as the building that once housed La Prensa, a major newspaper, and now is used as a government office building. This latter building is a derivation of the Palais Garnier, Paris's ornate opera, with a roof crowned by a gilded statue celebrating press freedom and an interior graced by an assortment of French and Italian murals of the Fragonard variety.
But the best idea is a long walk along the avenue, stopping at the antique bookshops, cafes and ice cream parlors, and late at night, the lively Avila flamenco club. Just above the Avila, it is worth taking a look inside the bizarre Barolo office building. The soaring skyscraper was designed in the early 1920's by an Italian architect, Mario Palanti, whose imagination inspired undulating balconies and sculptures, multiple domes within domes, and wall inscriptions from Dante's "Divine Comedy."
Fabio Grementieri, an architectural historian who works for the City of Buenos Aires, showed a friend and me around Avenida de Mayo recently. We toured one building that is a smaller version of Vienna's central postal building, as well as buildings with European architectural motifs ranging from German Jugendstil to Italian Liberty Style. At 747 Avenida de Mayo, an office building worth seeing for its ornate grillwork, is a typical hodgepodge of splendor: The classical-looking pediments on the second floor are Flemish, while the tower, spire and mansard roof are obviously French.
"Walking up Avenida de Mayo feels like Paris, but it's really like Budapest," Mr. Grementieri said. "That is why when Alan Parker wanted to finish filming 'Evita' after he left Buenos Aires, he went to Budapest."
Francophiles who like to shop at Nina Ricci and Louis Vuitton will like this second tour: a stroll along the Avenida Alvear from the Plaza Francia to Plazoleta Carlos Pellegrini. It is Buenos Aires's most elegant avenue, well worth taking the short walk after the obligatory visit to the Recoleta cemetery. It's a way to combine a visit to the grave of Argentina's greatest populist, Evita Peron, with a view of the mansions once owned by the very oligarchy she loathed. Snacks are recommended in between: coffee and pastry (Viennese or French) at the Cafe La Biela or a drink in the lobby bar at the handsome Alvear Palace Hotel, Buenos Aires's answer to the Ritz.
There are nearly a dozen blocks of French architectural gems on the Alvear. Architectural historians bemoan the fact that that so many of the turn-of-the-century mansions built by the great cattle families of Argentina -- grand examples of late Victorian, Beaux-Arts and Italian Renaissance -- were destroyed during the city's several urban renewals since the 1930's. Most of the lost mansions were replaced by neo-classical apartment houses that are French in feeling. Among the mansions left standing, the most impressive are the Vatican Embassy on the corner of Montevideo Street, and the eerie, ivy-draped Residencia Duhau at 1671 Avenida Alvear. The Vatican Embassy has a marvelous mansard roof, as does the Brazilian ambassador's residence in the Plazoleta Carlos Pellegrini.
The latter is a nice copy of the Jacquemart-Andre Museum on Boulevard Haussmann in Paris, with a sprinkling of accents added from the chateau at Fontainebleau. It was built in the 1920's by the Peredas, one of several Argentine cattle families who visited Europe and made copies of the buildings they liked most when they returned. "Rich as an Argentine" was a popular phrase in Europe in the 1920's.
Regrettably, the Brazilian ambassador's residence is only open to the public for tours on rare occasions, as is the neighboring French Embassy, one of the more complex Beaux-Arts buildings in the city. The latter was set to be bulldozed in the 1970's under the military junta, to expand the Avenida 9 de Julio. Residents complained bitterly. President Valery Giscard d'Estaing of France agreed, stood up to the generals, and said his diplomats would not move.
It just goes to show that interesting buildings usually have interesting stories. And the Plaza San Martin, the heart of a third walking tour, has many of both. It is Buenos Aires's most beautiful plaza, especially in early November when the brilliant purple jacaranda trees are in bloom. The jacarandas were transplanted from the tropical north and are an integral part of the landscaping by Charles Thays, a French architect who also worked on Parisian parks at the turn of the century.
A slow walk around the Circulo Militar, the Louvre spinoff, is a good place to start a tour of the Plaza San Martin. This wonder of opulence was once owned by Jose C. Paz, the publisher of La Prensa, who built the grandest palace he could in order to entertain there once he became president. Mr. Paz never won the presidency, but he did give one very special party in his mansion during which he introduced the tango to Argentine high society in the 1920's -- shortly after it won acceptance in Paris.
The only part of the old Paz mansion open to the public is a small military museum.
On the other side of Plaza San Martin is the mansion built by the Anchorenas (a branch of the same family that built what is today the Vatican embassy), now the ceremonial center of the Argentine Foreign Ministry. Designed by Alejandro Christophersen -- the Argentine architect who was born in Spain to Norwegian parents in 1866 and trained in Brussels and Paris -- the mansion takes up a block and is a galloping mix of French classicism and Art Nouveau. It is closed to the public, but a peek through the gate reveals the cobblestoned cour d'honneur with its understated grillwork and columns designed to reflect the Louis XIV and XV periods. Around the block, on Calle Basavilbaso, an enchanting little black iron and glass pavilion juts out of the Anchorena mansion with a terrace on top.
Mercedes Castellanos de Anchorena wanted her palace to have a view of the Rio de la Plata and the austere neo-Romanesque Santisimo Sacramento church across the plaza that she had simultaneously built with an imposing marble altar lavishly decorated with bronze, mosaic and onyx. The glorious view lasted about 20 years.
In the early 1930's, an aspiring oligarch named Corina Kavanagh fell in love with New York's Art Deco skyscrapers. When she bankrolled construction of an Art Deco behemoth at 1065 Calle Florida, it spoiled the Anchorenas' view, starting a feud that has been called "the war of the socialites."
The Kavanagh Building, in any case, is a nice reminder of home for any New Yorker.
No trip is complete without a visit to the Teatro Colon. Like seeing a tango show, attending the opera at the Colon is a rich window on Argentine glamour and style. The opera season that just ended was plagued by bad labor relations, financial problems and sometimes awful reviews.
But no matter the quality of the music, a big part of the experience of attending a performance at the Colon is partaking in the luxury and history of the building. It is a monumental mix of Italian, Viennese and French styles that is massive even by the dimensions of the Avenida 9 de Julio, one of the widest avenues in the world at almost 600 feet across, on which it stands. The exterior displays layers of arches, mouldings, sculptures, balconies and columns that some critics have characterized as more severe than beautiful. But it is the interior that really shines -- even if most of the marbled walls are really only painted stucco.
FOR those who cannot attend an opera, there is a one-hour tour of the theater given in English and several other languages. I have taken the tour twice, and my only complaint is that there was not a mention of the sordid crime that changed the architectural destiny of the Colon. But the guides are courteous and knowledgeable, pointing out details from the Venetian mosaics on the floors and the beautiful mix of white Italian marble and pink Portuguese marble on the stairways to the boxes and orchestra seats still covered in their original burgundy velvet and gold brocade.
Designed by Francisco Tamburini, an Italian architect, just before his death, the auditorium has virtually perfect acoustics. The crystal chandelier has 700 bulbs, and there is a thin circular corridor at the top of the muraled domed ceiling that allows 15 musicians and singers to perform above the heads of the audience.
The guides like to quote Pavarotti, who once said after performing there that the theater had only one defect: "It is so perfect you can easily hear every mistake."
But for me the best part of the tour is the several floors below ground, where you get a rare chance to see world-class ballet dancers practice and several historic opera costumes on display. The heaviest of them is a gown from Mussorgsky's "Boris Godounov"; inlaid with faux jewels, it weighs 50 pounds. And there is a dress worn by the soprano Claudia Muzio in a 1933 performance of "Tosca."
And the theater's tragedy and scandal are operatic in scale. Sadly, Tamburini did not live long enough to hear a formal concert in his masterpiece. And before his protege, a fellow Italian named Victor Meano, could complete Tamburini's work, he was murdered -- shot by a man he found uninvited in his house one night in 1904. It was the former butler who did it, one fired a few months before, who was having an affair with Meano's wife.
The third architect to lead the project, a Belgian named Julio Dormal, was no fan of Meano's and scotched most of the remaining designs for the interior, including Tamburini's and Meano's desire for a corridor of stores in the lobby. Dormal junked that in favor of a grand entrance, and he looked to Versailles for the fabulously ornate, mirrored hall on the second floor.
Perfect for strolls at intermission and for Friday afternoon recitals, it is considered one of the great rooms in Argentina. It never would have existed had Meano's butler been more discreet.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
Euro Airport as Regional Hub

BYLINE: By ROGER COLLIS; ROGER COLLIS writes the Frequent Traveler column for The International Herald Tribune.

 BODY:
SWISSAIR has introduced nonstop service from Newark to Basel, Switzerland, welcome news to travelers who can now make fast connections through a small, user-friendly airport to provincial cities like Bilbao, Nuremberg, Dresden, Toulouse, Nice, Marseilles, Valencia, Friedrichshafen and Rostock.
There are also flights to major cities such as London and Berlin, but often to business airports like London City and Tempelhof, a short cab ride to the city center. In addition, there are connections to megahubs like Heathrow, Charles de Gaulle in Paris, Amsterdam and Frankfurt -- if that's where you need to go. 
 The six-times-weekly service, which began Dec. 17, is by Swissair Airbus 310 (42 business-class and 143 economy seats) as a code-share with Delta Airlines and Crossair -- Swissair's regional subsidiary -- which is developing an extensive hub-and-spoke network through Basel.
Newark-Basel is the first of a dozen similar "long, thin" services (that is, with sparse traffic) that will be operated in Crossair colors on routes such as Basel-Buenos Aires/Atlanta/ Mexico City/Charlotte, N.C. -- what I call regional long-haul routes. Cross air ultimately plans to acquire a long-haul fleet of upgraded Boeing 767's to serve these routes.
Book a flight to Basel or Mulhouse, France, and you'll arrive at the same airport -- Euro Airport Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg -- right at the border separating Switzerland, France and Germany in the Upper Rhine Valley.
Four million people live within 60 minutes of the airport, which is 6.3 miles (10 kilometers) from Basel; 16 miles (26 kilometers) from Mulhouse and 46 miles (75 kilometers) from Freiburg in the southwestern corner of Germany. Zurich will be 45 minutes away when a new highway is completed.
Euro Airport, 50 years old but in the process of expansion, will have served nearly three million passengers in 1998 (around 40 percent each from France and Switzerland and 20 percent from Germany) with 12 airlines currently offering more than 45 scheduled flights to 92 destinations in 25 countries. Such carriers as Air France, British Airways, Sabena, KLM and Lufthansa serve 36 cities in 20 countries from Euro Airport.
 
Bypassing the Megahubs
Crossair plans to develop Euro Airport as a regional hub for people who wish to travel between, say, Nuremberg and Bilbao, or Dresden and Toulouse, thus saving time and avoiding the misery of changing planes at a megahub like Amsterdam, Brussels, Frankfurt, London, Paris or Zurich, which give priority to long-haul connections.
Crossair's "Euro Cross" is a new strategy that provides more than 520 connections a day between 40 cities through Euro Airport with an expected connecting time of 20 minutes. The carrier aims to have 1,000 daily connections linking 48 European destinations by next year, including regional services from Euro Airport to such destinations as Warsaw, Budapest, Athens, Ankara, Bologna, Stockholm, Copenhagen, Glasgow, Oporto, Trieste and Moscow, as well as long-haul routes to North America and Asia.
Euro Cross flights arrive and depart in four coordinated waves: early in the morning, midday, afternoon and evening, enabling people traveling to and from most destinations in Europe to get there and back the same day. For example, Toulouse-Vienna via Euro Cross is 2 hours 15 minutes faster than via Zurich; Amsterdam-Bilbao is 2 hours faster than via Paris; and Friedrichshafen-Birmingham is 1 hour 30 minutes faster than connecting in Frankfurt.
"If someone could fly point-to-point from Frankfurt to Palma at a suitable time, he would never go via Euro Cross, or if someone in Nuremberg could save time by flying to Bordeaux via Frankfurt, he would not use Euro Cross," says Moritz Suter, president and chief executive of Crossair. "But people will take Euro Cross because it is faster and easier in many cases."
 
Convenience at a Price
Crossair flies to 82 European destinations (plus around 25 routes on behalf of Swissair) with a fleet of 80 aircraft consisting of 33-seat Saab 340 turboprops, 50-seat Saab 2000 turboprops and 97-seat Avro RJ jets. The company carried 4.7 million passengers in 1997 -- 19 percent more than the previous year -- and made a net profit of about $28 million.
Small planes operating frequent flights on lightly traveled routes and relatively high fares are the key ingredients to Crossair's success. Round-trip fares from Euro Airport to London City, a 15-minute cab ride from the City, or Heathrow are $1,085 in business class, $845 in economy and $185 discounted fare.
Crossair is what you might call a "high frills" carrier. Riding the 33-seat Saab 340 Cityliner, for example, is the next best thing to a private plane. On short flights you're served regional specialties with wines to match, or open sandwiches of smoked salmon and cheese with Champagne from a real bottle.
The triangle where the frontiers of Switzerland, France and Germany intersect on the Rhine is the crossroads of ancient north-south and east-west trading routes, in use long before the nations were created. Alsace changed hands many times between France and Germany over the years -- belonging to Germany from 1871 to 1918 and again from 1940 to 1944.
From the balcony of Mr. Suter's office at the airport, you can see the city of Basel to the south, St. Louis in France to the north, and beyond that the German city of Weil-am-Rhein on the other side of the Rhine and to the northeast Lorrach, in Germany. Mulhouse is to the northeast; to the north is Mulheim in Germany and Strasbourg in France.
 
A Historical Crossroads
The region had its genesis as a trading hub in 1226 when Bishop von Thun of Basel mortgaged his entire fortune to build the first bridge on the Rhine -- the tollhouse still stands in the center of the old bridge. Merchant caravans from Scandinavia and northern Germany would come down through the Rhine Valley, crossing the river at Basel on their way south via the Alps to Italy; the silk caravans from China came up from the Balkans, crossing the Rhine here, and continuing on to Paris and London.
In the mid-19th century, railway engineers followed the old caravan routes: the night express from Stockholm to Palermo still crosses the Rhine at Basel -- one of the most important railway hubs in central Europe.
Germany and France have train stations on Swiss ground in the center of Basel. Modern highways follow the old routes from north to south and west to east, still crossing the Rhine at Basel.
The Euro Airport is an intercultural experience. It is built on French soil and run by a kind of public joint venture between France and Switzerland with board members from each country along with representatives from Germany -- a fast-growing sector of the airport's business.
There is a French-Swiss frontier within the airport, which apparently can be shifted depending on how many departure gates are needed on either side.
The Eurobar straddles the frontier; the same bartender serves on both sides. The Airport Grill offers entirely different menus on the French and Swiss sides, with the food coming from the same kitchen. A three-course dinner with wine could cost $55 a person on the Swiss side, a third less on the French side.
Whether you use the French or Swiss side depends, of course, on where you're heading. (Each country has its own immigration and customs channels.) But it may be a good idea to compare taxi and car rental prices in French and Swiss francs. There are separate parking lots on each side.
If you're going to Germany, you can come out either side. But the airport bus to Freiburg goes from the French exit. And a French taxi is likely to cost a lot less than a Swiss taxi. You may like the idea of taking a French taxi to Germany or Switzerland.

HEADLINE: THE CAPITALIST;
Euro Neurosis

BYLINE: By JEFFREY E. GARTEN; Jeffrey E. Garten is dean of the Yale School of Management.

 BODY:
For more than 50 years washington longed for a strong Europe as a political and economic partner. With the limited introduction of the euro last week, will the gods be punishing us by granting our wish?
 The birth of the euro is the most important change in the international financial arena since 1971, when President Nixon announced that the dollar would no longer be exchangeable into gold. The "euro zone" will have a larger population than America's and the second largest economy in the world. For the first time since pre-World War I days, when the British pound was the world's key currency, a potential rival to the U.S. dollar is on the horizon. 
 What difference could all this make to Americans? Three scenarios, all set approximately five years from now, when the euro is fully established in world markets, give a glimpse of what may lie ahead.
 1. TRADE WAR Suppose a series of global trade negotiations is reaching its conclusion in 2004. Let's assume that the entire negotiation becomes stalemated, with recriminations and threats flying across the Atlantic. To pressure Washington, the European Central Bank -- the equivalent of our Federal Reserve -- begins to lower interest rates, thereby weakening the euro. As a depreciating euro makes European products cheaper, imports begin to flood American markets.
 Washington, fearing a rapidly rising trade deficit and slower economic growth, faces an agonizing choice: either push down the dollar in retaliation, thereby starting a global trade war, or give in on a few trade issues. Uncle Sam caves.
 2. DOLLAR COLLAPSE Suppose American intelligence discovers that North Korea is mobilizing troops for an invasion. Washington visibly strengthens military ties with Tokyo to demonstrate to North Korea that both American and Japanese soldiers are prepared to defend South Korea.
 China is offended by the American initiative because it has historically felt threatened by the United States-Japan military alliance, and because it wants to reduce the tensions in its own backyard by less confrontational diplomacy. Unable to pressure Washington any other way, Beijing begins to exchange a portion of its huge holdings of Treasury bonds for euro securities, which are seen as a good substitute for the greenback.
 As dollars are sold, the greenback falls sharply in value. Aside from being livid that someone is manipulating its currency, Washington also has to be concerned about the threat of inflation that will arise because cheaper dollars will raise prices on imports. President Gore or President Bush offers to meet his Chinese counterpart to discuss less provocative ways to handle the confrontation.
 3. LEADERSHIP CRISIS Asia has recovered from economic collapse, but a new financial debacle occurs in Latin America. Because America's trade and banking links to the region have become so strong, Washington quickly orders the International Monetary Fund to provide bailout funds. But wait. A new voice is heard from Frankfurt, headquarters of the European Central Bank.
 "Not so fast," it says. "Latin America is your problem, not ours." The European Fed uses its voting power, which now aggregates at least 11 European nations, to veto Washington's plans. It is the first veto of such American action, and the President is forced to plead with Congress for taxpayer funds to rescue our friends to the south.
These aren't paranoid stories from the twilight zone. In the past, Washington hasn't hesitated to use dollar diplomacy to press Japan to open its markets, to force England and France to change their foreign policies and to muscle the I.M.F. to intervene abroad in economic crises. Now that there will be two powerful global currencies, why shouldn't the new big guy on the block exercise his clout from time to time?
 The euro won't necessarily lead to confrontation between Europe and America. But if it succeeds, it will mark the passing of the old order for Europe, for Washington's dominance of trans-Atlantic relationships and for the conduct of international finance.
 America had it easy when it was king of the hill, printing money to finance its chronic trade deficits and service its growing foreign debts. And in times of great crisis or uncertainty, the world parked its money in Treasury securities, contributing to a stronger dollar and lower interest rates. Now that there will be two economic giants, investors will have a choice, and America will have to play by someone else's rules.
 The big question is whether Washington and Europe will cooperate closely to manage global monetary affairs, or whether they will try to practice traditional hardball financial diplomacy. For the sake of economic growth everywhere, let's hope they take the friendly path. Otherwise, the global economy is in for turmoil that will vastly overshadow anything that has happened in Asia recently. When the relationship between the dollar and the euro goes haywire, countries accounting for nearly half of world trade and production will be affected, and the ripples will insure that all global trade and investment will become unsettled.
Money is increasingly the currency of power these days, and the old patterns and relationships are about to change. How Washington and Wall Street handle this new challenge will say a lot about how the new century begins -- in America and around the world.

HEADLINE: What Welfare-to-Work Really Means

 BODY:
Thanks to Jason DeParle for his thoughtful and revealing article (Dec. 20). He captured the contradictions of nationwide welfare- reform efforts. It is unfortunate that welfare policy continues to be gripped by the same conflicting impulses to protect and to punish the needy that have characterized American public-assistance policy for more than 200 years. The coexistence of social-services workers and fraud investigators within agencies whose stated purpose is to serve the needy epitomizes this tension. The overworked and undertrained workers on the front lines of welfare reform across the nation deserve some clarification as to whether their duty is to alleviate poverty (an economic condition, let us not forget) or to cut welfare caseloads. Without such clarification, they are being set up for failure by the powers that be.

HEADLINE: ART/ARCHITECTURE;
Outreach, the Wandering Museum's Specialty

BYLINE: By VICKI GOLDBERG; Vicki Goldberg is the author of "Power of Photography: How Photography Changed Our Lives."

 BODY:
ART gets around. Museums are pretty well stuck in one spot, but their treasures keep on truckin'. At a time when museums build buildings that tend to be more significant than the collections they shelter, some centers have gone the less expensive route of converting existing industrial centers into galleries. A few others are experimenting with putting art, at least temporarily, into essentially unconverted places that respectable museums would once have thought dreadfully infra dig: marginal retail areas, department stores, dance halls.
If a museum can install art in abandoned banks and garages, if the New Museum in SoHo can call itself a museum though it has no permanent collection, if the Contemporary Museum in Baltimore can operate with neither collection nor home, has the museum been redefined as merely a state of mind? 
 A museum is still a museum if it's closed for a year or two, but its exhibition potential drops alarmingly. At the Pompidou Center in Paris, the permanent collection has been closed since September 1997 while the galleries are being restored, though the contemporary galleries remain open for temporary exhibitions until mid-1999. (The entire museum will then close until the year 2000.) But France's modern treasures have not been stashed in mothballs. Bernard Blistene, vice director for contemporary art of the Pompidou, says with a tinge of horror in his voice that putting such a great collection into storage for two years would amount to confiscation.
Besides, the Pompidou, a national museum and well aware that not everyone can travel to the capital, considers decentralization part of its mission. Already the biggest lender in the world, according to Mr. Blistene -- approximately 6,000 items every year -- the Pompidou is sending out more than 100 loan exhibitions while its doors are shut. Among them are major shows of Kandinsky and Giacometti for regional museums in France, 120 "masterpieces of the collection" for Tokyo, and the exhibitions of 20th-century art currently at both branches of the Guggenheim in New York.
Mr. Blistene is also organizing an enormous exhibition in a Paris department store for March. This will occupy an entire floor -- more than 16,000 square feet -- of Le Samaritain, a store where you can buy a lipstick, a bike and a hamster in one outing. Le Samaritain has never before regarded itself as a branch of the national museums of France.
This store, an early example of an emporium where people discovered they could buy floor mops and frou-frou in one place, will house a festival of art by young contemporary artists, many of whom are marrying conventional arts to unconventional media. The exhibition will include fashion, performance, music, dance, lectures and happenings, all free. Mr. Blistene says he would "like to reconsider the generosity and diversity of art of this century, the intensity and efficiency of contemporary art, not art as just a dead object."
Why a department store? Michael Kimmelman pointed out in The New York Times that in America, from the late 19th century to the 1950's, certain department stores maintained the populist ideal by giving lowly shoppers a taste of high art. Some of these exhibitions in the land of commerce were mounted with the aid of museums. In the 1930's, the Museum of Modern Art's "Machine Art" show traveled to department stores in the Middle West. The French have only occasionally shown art in a department store; depending more heavily on Louis XVI than Thomas Paine, they have been more inclined to use national fairs than commercial outlets to educate the public taste in art.
Mr. Blistene, however, is delighted with the opportunity to put art where once only shoppers dared to tread. He notes that people go where things are happening -- the Armory, for instance, or the Gramercy Park Hotel in New York when they open up to art. And he was looking for an empty place and a site for stimulation and activity, "a way to react against the temptation of being melancholy," as he puts it.
He believes that nostalgia is currently being used as a barrier against contemporary reality but insists that art must remain involved as well as critical. "People think it was better yesterday," he says. "I think it's always better tomorrow." One might think shopping was the way to cure melancholy in today's society; perhaps Le Samaritain will provide an avant-garde alternative to the capitalist anodyne it ordinarily prescribes.
It seems only fitting that at a moment when museums are creating virtual department stores within their precincts, the jazziest art of the day should take up residence in the realm of the ladies who lunch. And it is delicious to think that someday at Bloomingdale's or Saks the mechanical voice that now and then pretends to be an elevator operator might call out, "Lingerie and intimates on four; fifth floor, Pollock, Rothko and de Kooning."
FOR those who will not go to the mount of Parnassus, Parnassus will obligingly come to them. Art long ago joined the rounds of daily life via public sculpture in parks and airline terminals and on occasional billboards and advertising pages. Museums, too, want to creep into quotidian consciousness, to play a role in the texture of ordinary, 9-to-5 life.
They also need more space for display and are conscious that they need to address different audiences. The Los Angeles Contemporary Museum opened not one but two temporary spaces and, like the man who came to dinner, they stayed on. In the late 1970's, the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts had a wandering exhibition on an "art truck" until insurance and conservation permanently put on the brakes.
Two and a half years ago, the W.P.A./ Corcoran, part of the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington but independent of it, began putting on shows of emerging regional artists, many of them recent graduates of art schools in the Baltimore, Washington and Richmond area. The shows now appear in Project Space, temporary quarters in a former nightclub called the Insect Club in a slightly rundown business district. Metal grasshoppers as large as hallucinations still stand guard by the door while the bar looms darkly along one wall.
This decor is appropriately rakish for the kind of installation art that sends aluminum-foil leaves wafting across the gallery to the sound of grinding gears, or displays suits that look like torture instruments, with artists strapped into them on weekends. MCI, the communications company, opened a sports arena nearby late in 1977, and Nadine Gabai-Botero, the program director for the W.P.A./Corcoran, says the area's economic good fortune will probably drive out unprofitable contemporary art. Then art will be on to the next marginal area, perhaps to spaces that are available only for a month or two, prime for a lightning strike by the art corps.
This is a guerrilla art tactic, to invade a location where art never lived and billet the art troops there for a while, a maneuver not usually employed by established museums. In the late 1960's and 70's, when artists were vigorously questioning and frequently repudiating the role of museums, alternative spaces sprang up to shelter art that did not want entry to museums, or could not gain it. After a while a few museums saw the usefulness of such places and began to set up their own alternatives.
Baltimore's Contemporary Museum has made guerrilla artfare a modus vivendi. A museum without a museum, the Contemporary is a full-time nomad, a homeless institution that not only has no collection but has no location either.
Founded in 1989 and headed since 1996 by Gary Sangster, the Contemporary puts on two shows a year, one in, and in conjunction with, a local institution and the other in some highly improbable place, like a former Polish convent, a former Buick car dealership, an abandoned bus garage without electricity and the former Famous Ballroom, without either fame or heat.
"Catfish Dreamin'," a project by Alison Saar, was installed on a 1959 Chevy pick-up and driven into 80 neighborhoods in four states over a period of five months, giving the term "traveling show" a down-home dimension. "Too Jewish?," a show organized by and first shown at the Jewish Museum in New York, was exhibited in Baltimore in a vacant shopping mall, a notable instance of art taking up where commerce leaves off.
This doggedly temporary Contemporary Museum first made a national name for itself in 1992 when it worked with the Maryland Historical Society to install Fred Wilson's "Mining the Museum," an ironic look at the neglect of African-Americans and Native Americans in historical displays. A show last spring, "Mysterious Voyages/New Photography," a bold exploration of the current search for meaning in photography and art by artists like Sophie Calle, Adam Fuss, Andreas Gursky and Thomas Struth, was in the vacant ground floor of a downtown office building three blocks from Baltimore's red-light district and two from a police station. Visitor records revealed an audience drawn from both the surrounding area and the art world; the attempt to reach a local community must be working.
Mr. Sangster says: "We operate in the discourse of ideas about the visual. We're not here just to expose artists or artworks but ideas that influence the community through visual means." The Contemporary asked visitors, including some local critics, to write their own labels for "Mysterious Voyages"; eventually three were put up for each piece.
Mr. Sangster would now like a more permanent space -- ideally an aircraft hangar in the middle of Baltimore, if only he could find one -- to give the museum a stronger identity. In the meantime he is eyeing the Web, having already done one show on it, as the most likely means to preserve the explorations of a museum that cannot afford to publish. The Web, in fact, may be the outreach museum of the future, bringing art straight to your desk at any hour. Numerous museums and galleries beam it into your home right now, unfortunately at a resolution not much more convincing than the one you made on New Year's Eve.
So what is a museum, and where? It may be whatever a director or curator says it is, a rather new twist on Marcel Duchamp. Back in the 1920's, Hannes Meyer, an instructor at the Bauhaus, thought that museums should all be rededicated as soccer fields. The history of art takes many curious turns; we may yet live to see soccer fields rededicated as museums.

HEADLINE: Asheville Public Market Hoping to Bloom

BYLINE: By LYN RIDDLE 

DATELINE: ASHEVILLE, N.C.

 BODY:
The Grove Arcade began life in 1929 as a public market, but housed Federal offices for nearly half a century. By year's end, the mammoth building in the heart of this city's downtown will recapture its birthright.
This month workers moved into the 269,000-square-foot building, one of the nation's first indoor malls, to begin the $10 million transformation. Asheville officials hope a public market will do for their city what similar enterprises have done for others. 
 In the last decade, public markets, with locally owned small businesses that focus on selling local products, have breathed life back into downtowns or renewed long-neglected sections across the nation. Dozens of cities are building or planning new markets, including the Portland Public Market in Portland, Me., which opened in November. In other cities like Atlanta and Buffalo, millions of dollars have been invested in long-standing markets.
"As institutions, they're so ancient, one of the things that we all share cross-culturally," said David K. O'Neil, the former manager of the Reading Market in Philadelphia, who is now a market consultant. "It's nice to have a center of your community where everything connects."
Markets, he said, touch people at an emotional level.
"People are attracted to people," he said. "They love to buy from people who know the product." Markets, he added, create an environment of conviviality.
Mr. O'Neil estimates 100 markets exist today. Best known perhaps is Pike Place Market in Seattle, founded in 1907, which noticeably declined in the 1970's.
After $55 million was invested in the market, it turned around. Today, the market spills across 22 acres on Puget Sound and attracts 11 million people each year. It also generated a total investment of $650 million from private developers of stores, hotels and 1,800 apartment units.
Aaron H. Zaretsky, the executive director of the Asheville effort, was a director at Pike Place for 15 years before moving here three years ago. Mr. Zaretsky heads the Grove Arcade Public Market Foundation, a nonprofit organization that has leased the building from the city.
The Grove Arcade was built by E. W. Grove, who made a fortune selling tonics that were said to cure all manner of ills. His slogan was "makes children and adults as fat as pigs." Mr. Grove also built the Grove Park Inn, a luxury resort still operating about five miles away from the arcade.
Mr. Grove had planned for a high-rise tower on top of the marketplace, but he died before the building was finished. The work stopped at just two stories. In 1942, the Federal Government, looking for space outside Washington to house agencies not essential to the war effort, bought the Grove Arcade. Until three years ago when a new Federal Building was built a block away, all the nation's weather data were stored at the National Climatic Data Center in the Grove Arcade.
At one time, the largest computer in the region -- an eight-foot-tall UNIVAC used to store weather data that filled an 80- by 150-foot room -- was housed in the building. It was such a novelty that a small platform was built outside the office so residents could watch it work. The platform still exists in the arcade walkway.
When the weather center and other smaller Federal agencies moved into the new Federal Building, the Government deeded the property to the city. The foundation that has leased the building from the city is responsible for the renovation of the basement and first floor of the building, while a private developer will refurbish the upper two floors and a mezzanine for offices and residences.
On the first floor, foundation planners hope to lease space to an eclectic mix of businesses, everything from a Thai restaurant to a bicycle shop, a fish market to a craft store. To keep the flavor of a public market, all the stores will be locally owned and will cater to a local clientele. Generally, public markets provide opportunity to small businesses, giving them an edge on larger, nationally known chains.
And some nationally known businesses have started out at public markets. Starbucks Coffee began as a small coffeehouse in Pike Place.
Public markets are not to be confused with festival markets, which H. Christopher Slusher, Mr. Zaretsky's assistant, describes as shopping districts filled with upscale national chains catering to tourists. Fanueil Hall in Boston and Inner Harbor in Baltimore would be considered festival markets, he said.
Public markets are more down-home, as in a fish store in Pike Place where a worker is apt to throw a salmon across the shop to have it wrapped for a customer. "The stores showcase the best products of a region," said Mr. Slusher, an architect who worked for the National Trust for Historic Preservation before coming here in 1998.
Here, Appalachian crafts and handmade furniture will be spotlighted, as will smoked salmon and ramp, a garlicky onion that grows wild in the southern Appalachians and is considered a delicacy. Mr. Slusher hopes stores will feature baskets, weaving and quilting as well as the basic needs: groceries, banks, photo developing, garden supply, ice cream shop, a mailing service.
So far, 450 people have expressed a desire to open a shop in the public market area, which ultimately will have 60 spaces plus about 15 stalls for fresh food vendors. Financing comes from a $1 million grant from the United States Economic Development Administration, $1 million in contributions and $2.5 million in financing. A parking lot -- for cars and bicycles -- will be constructed in the basement.
The foundation has leased the top three floors of the building to Rick Skelton, an Atlanta developer who intends to renovate the space for an undetermined number of offices and 52 apartments that will be converted to condominiums in a few years. In addition, a band shell in the tower overlooking the rooftop will be renovated and the roof will be used for public gatherings, meetings, receptions and dancing.
The residences and the rooftop overlook downtown Asheville and the Blue Ridge Mountains, which ring this city of 60,000 in western North Carolina. The marketplace will serve to foster an already reviving downtown, said City Manager James L. Westbrook Jr. He hopes the city will be able to attract a medium-priced hotel chain to the block between the marketplace and Asheville Civic Center to enable the city to play host to bigger conventions.
Unlike some larger and more famous Southern cities like Atlanta and Charlotte, Asheville has not leveled its historic buildings in favor of new development. City leaders say it has the nation's second largest number of Art Deco buildings after Miami. City Hall itself is an Art Deco tower whose renovation has just been completed with a $1 million yearlong replacement of its distinctive red tile roof.
A few blocks away is the First Baptist Church, whose Art Deco design sets it apart from its Baptist cousins of staid brick, high white steeples and white columns.
"It was a conscious decision to retain these buildings," Mr. Westbrook said.
The city has worked, too, to develop and enhance its artistic side. Shops that were long empty now house art galleries, jewelry stores, crafts, even a shop that features items from expeditions. Pack Square features a number of museums, including one that features minerals and gemstones, for which North Carolina is famous. Sculpture dresses up many street corners and yards outside buildings. One notable piece -- by Albert Paley, the metal sculptor -- stands outside the new Federal Building. Some locals consider it brilliant; others say it looks like a plane crash.
Mr. Slusher says planners hope the Arcade Marketplace will further revitalize life in the inner city.
"This building was beautifully designed and is in remarkable condition," he said. "This city has a heart and soul as an urban center and can reclaim itself as the center for commerce in the region. We're well on our way to doing that."

Pride, as Fragile as Glass, Is Shattered

BYLINE: By NEIL GENZLINGER 

 BODY:
THERE are thousands of things to break in the southern New Jersey glass-making city of Millville. Go there with a toddler, as I did recently, and you can expect a day full of lessons in fragility and frustration.
Which is appropriate, in a glum way, because at the moment the people of Millville know quite a lot about both. They know that fragility isn't limited to ornate glasswork; it extends to jobs, factories, ties to the past. And they know that in the economy of the late 20th century, the definition of frustration is this: You make a basic, utilitarian product, you make it well, your plant turns a profit, and you still get thrown out of a job. 
 Last month Millville learned that the Ball-Foster Glass Container plant, whose six giant smokestacks are a sort of local signature, will close at the end of March. About 300 jobs will go with it, as will a bit of history. Ball-Foster and its predecessors have been making glass at Millville since 1806, longer than anyone else in America.
For Millville, this is gloomy news indeed. "It raises our unemployment rate three points, just this one closing," said Kim Warker, the city's economic development director -- raises it to 10.5 percent.
The toddler and I didn't go to Millville to see the Ball-Foster plant, of course. We went to see the romantic side of glass -- Wheaton Village, where you find gorgeous displays at the Museum of American Glass and $1,000 paperweights at shops next door.
Abby, the toddler, learned about frustration at that museum. There was smashable stuff everywhere, but it was safely in glass cases. She kept reaching for the 200-year-old bottles, the delicate lamps, but crunching her hand against the cases. It's a good thing; our guide said she'd heard that the only unbreakable glass object is a marble.
Across town, Lawrence Levy has been awash in his own frustration. He's a union leader at Ball-Foster. He knows his members do a hard, hot job ("I've caught on fire more than once") and do it well. They make hundreds of thousands of bottles a day, mostly beer bottles, but incredibly, that's not enough -- the factory is old, and Ball-Foster can do the job faster and cheaper at some of its 19 other plants.
Mr. Levy is frustrated that the factory is closing even though it runs harmoniously -- he goes out of his way to praise the plant manager, Al Camp. He and many others call the plant a Nafta casualty, and they wonder if any of this would have happened had Ball-Foster not been owned by the French conglomerate St.-Gobain.
"You might as well run the foreign flag up and down at City Hall," Mr. Levy says, noting that Millville's two other glass makers are also foreign-owned. "We've given away our industrial base in this country."
The thing is, at Ball-Foster headquarters in Muncie, Ind., you hear a similar note of despair. "The glass business has been consolidating left and right, and what is terribly frustrating is, it's plants with good people, good attitudes," says Joel Patrick, the director of marketing and communications.
"In a sense," Mr. Patrick says, "you wish you had something to point to" -- union strife, sagging quality, whatever -- "but we have nothing to point to." Just not enough business to go around, thanks to plastic.
Back in Millville the $1,000-paperweight world is just as disappointed as the factory world. There's a rare mutual respect there. It's because the one came from the other -- back in the 1800's, it was workers tinkering on their lunch breaks who really expanded the notion of glass as art.
Gay Taylor, the museum's curator, says the first truly American paperweights came from Millville -- the famous Millville Rose was one. Ms. Taylor knows all about glass, how the sand and other natural resources of southern New Jersey gave rise to the industry; how that industry has been dying for decades. "This large plant is just a beautiful sight to see," Ms. Taylor says. "To think of it being idle is just devastating."
So we left Millville knowing a lot about fragility and frustration, and their connection. And when we got home, it seemed important to test the marble hypothesis.
Abby's older sister leaned out a second-story window and pitched a marble onto our concrete patio -- just a medium-strength throw. It survived easily. So we ran the test again, throwing the marble full force.
We're still looking for the marble. The impact sent it ricocheting off the patio and into last fall's unraked leaves. I like to think that a few years from now, Abby and I will be doing yardwork and will stumble upon the round nugget. Still in one piece; a survivor.

DEAR DIARY:
I was coming out of the Lincoln Tunnel and heading home to Weehawken when I looked up to see the large Panasonic sign saying, "Honk if you love digital." 
 Under the Panasonic sign is an official road sign that says, "Blowing horn is $350 fine."

During the recent holiday shopping frenzy, a cab pulled over at Cornelia and West 4th Streets in the West Village in Manhattan. A young woman with flowing hair and doe-like eyes hopped out, struggling with an enormous package the size of a hamper.
She placed the box on the sidewalk and tried to get a better grip on it. Many people glanced over, but only one offered assistance.
"Can I help you with that, miss?" said a gentleman who was carrying gifts of his own. He reached out to help the woman steady the huge box.
"Thank you," she said, "but I'm not going very far."
"No problem," the man replied. "I'm just waiting here for a few minutes until my wife is finished shopping."
The damsel-in-not-much-distress said: "I'll be O.K. But that's very nice. It's unusual for someone to offer help like that around here."
The good samaritan replied: "Well, I live in New Jersey. We do things like that."
"I'm sure that's it," she said with a smile. Then the woman, the actress Elizabeth Berkley, hustled away, balancing the huge box and eventually entering a nearby building.

My sixth-grade daughter recently started home economics at Thompson Junior High School in Middleton. The first day of class she came home all excited and told us that she would be cooking things as soon as the next week.
I asked her the first thing they would be cooking.
"Kool-Aid," she exclaimed.

When Zachary got home he told me about the party, but said that it wasn't the real Barney.
"How do you know," I asked.
"He had a zipper," was the reply.

I came home from work recently to find a chipmunk in the upstairs hallway of my home in Mahwah.
I cornered him in the bedroom and rounded up a basket and a bowl to capture him and toss him outside. He ran from the closet to the bathroom, and I quickly closed the door.
When my husband came home -- using pillows and household objects -- he prepared a pathway from the bathroom door to the front door. With all other means of escape blocked, he opened the bathroom door.
The next thing I heard was: "Oh, honey, you don't have to worry about Alvin. He's gone."
Alvin had jumped into the toilet.

HEADLINE: To Get From Here to There, More Long Islanders Choosing a Limo

BYLINE: By STEWART KAMPEL 

 BODY:
WHEN Herbert Gross of East Northport needed to get to Islip MacArthur Airport the other day for a flight to his vacation home in Tamarac, Fla., he called Charlie. Charlie is Charles Lo Bianco Jr. of Class Limousine Inc., of Bellmore, who chauffeurs Mr. Gross, his family and his dog to and from the airport several times a year.
"We just find him very reliable. He helps us with our dog, Looie, and we avoid the hassle of the crazy traffic and deciding what to do with our car," said Mr. Gross, who is president of Vision Inc., an advertising agency in Manhattan. "And when we come back, either he's there or one of his drivers is." 
 Mr. Gross is one of a growing number of Long Islanders who have become fans of limousines -- once the transportation toy and ploy of only the well-to-do and celebrities.
One big reason is convenience.
"People are realizing, that's private and corporations, that the limo is highly efficient," said Rick Cohen, chief executive officer of Limousine Digest. "It fills a niche that no other type of transportation can."
If you have several people with luggage, he went on, you don't want to squeeze into a taxi. "The limo is moving more and more people."
Besides being efficient, limousines are safe -- a way to avoid the dangerous combination of drinking and driving.
Bob Kubika, president of the Nassau-Suffolk Limousine Association, a trade group representing more than 120 companies, said: "Nobody wants to be behind the wheel of a car where the driver has been drinking and nobody wants to get caught. It's dangerous and expensive. Being in a limo is a lot cheaper than getting caught."
The Christmas and New Year's Eve trade was extremely busy for the hundreds of limousine company owners on the Island. According to the State Department of Motor Vehicles, there were 1,999 limousines registered in Nassau County in 1997, and 2,011 in Suffolk. Rental prices range from $65 to $125 an hour.
When it comes to weddings, another staple of the limo business, there's no season. "There are 20,000 weddings in Nassau and Suffolk each year," said Kirk Ronnemann, the general manager of Boomer Esiason's Class One Limousine in Ronkonkoma, which already has more than 400 weddings booked for 1999. "And don't forget the bachelor and bachelorette parties."
(Mr. Esiason, the former football player turned announcer, is not a principal in the company but is a friend of an owner, Paul Lobel.)
Limousines rented for weddings often come with specially trained drivers who have become familiar with church procedures, help lay down a special carpet and send people down the aisle on time.
More than 90 percent of the long stretch vehicles on the Long Island roads are white. "Brides seem to like white," said Mr. Kubika, who has his own company in Ronkonkoma. "They make a big impression. They look bigger and snazzier."
In the past, limo businesses appeared and disappeared as fast as new telephone directories came out. But the steady wedding market, plus a strong economy, have helped the industry stabilize, according to John H. Gore of United States Coachworks.
Not every client is going to a wedding or an airport. In fact, Mr. Ronnemann recalled a client last spring who didn't want anything to do with airports; he asked to be driven to New Hampshire because he was afraid to fly. At the going-and-coming rate of $1.62 a mile, Mr. Ronnemann said, a plane ticket would have been cheaper.
Recently a sheik from Saudi Arabia rented a car for 15 days from Class One. "And a sedan to go behind for security," said Mr. Lobel. "The same driver traveled with the party the entire time. The sheik's people gave him a Rolex as a tip."
Mr. Ronnemann recalled another unusual trip, about three months ago, when a "rather destitute man, a real loser," suddenly came in to a lot of money as a result of a financial settlement. He hired a stretch limousine and asked to be driven to his old neighborhood in Central Islip to show off his new fortune. Once there, he and his friends consumed a case of beer and he got drunk.
"We took him back to the Holiday Inn so he could sleep it off," Mr. Ronnemann said. "But he called us back and wanted to do it again. We refused and he got rather indignant. We told him we wouldn't allow drinking in the car and our driver was not going to carry him to his room. By the way, he was carrying a bag with about $40,000 in cash."
Just about everyone in the industry seems to agree that, aside from convenience, a major factor in the increasing popularity of limousines is the fear of drunken drivers, in their own vehicle or on the other side of the road.
In general, Mr. Cohen of Limousine Digest said, the limousine "makes good sense" for those who want to drink. If friends get together, he said, they can split the cost and "for a few extra dollars they can drink and have a good time."
Around prom time, one of the busiest seasons, the limousine association sends a representative to speak to school officials and parents, outlining its no-drinking, no-drugs policy.
"We have a strict policy against young people drinking or doing drugs," said Mr. Kubika. "We work hand-in-hand with MADD Mothers Against Drunk Driving . We have the kids sign an agreement with their parents about drinking and drugs. The parents like it because they know we're going to take good care of their prize possessions."
Brian Gold, a candy distributor who lives in Garden City, hired a limo to take his son Nicholas and seven other 10th graders to the "Winter Wonderland" show at Garden City High School and to see the Christmas tree at E.A.B. Plaza in Uniondale, and then on to several parties.
"There's no question that the limo is a safe way of going," Mr. Gold said.
It can also be a splashy way, literally, for someone who rents the newest vehicle in the small fleet of Bob Marc Limousines of Deer Park. Marc Henig, the owner, has equipped a long white stretch with a Jacuzzi. It is obviously not for everyone.
"My late father thought I should counter the competition by doing something like this," said Mr. Henig, who arranged for a company in Texas to stretch a truck, a Ford F350 with four tires on the rear axle to handle additional weight. The hot tub carries 100 gallons of water, less than backyard tubs, but it can seat two to four people. The normal rate for renting this limo is $125 an hour, with a five-hour minimum.
In the two months he has offered the limo, Mr. Henig said, a few people have taken the plunge, at tailgate parties in the Meadowlands before football games, for example. "A girl in a bikini in a hot tub," Mr. Henig said, "is a perfect way to draw attention. And don't forget those couples that want a romantic interlude."
On one recent Saturday the limo with the hot tub saw service in Far Rockaway, Queens, rented as a gift for the wedding of Kishore Sumarzer and Amreeta Goolcharran of Far Rockaway. A friend, Rick Brocia, a cook at the Cornbread and Caviar restaurant in Baldwin, arranged for the five-hour rental after Mr. Sumarzer had seen the vehicle and admired it.
"The reaction from the bride's side was ecstatic," Mr. Brocia said. "Everybody wanted to get inside the limo -- it was too cold to use the tub -- and one time we had 20 people in it, looking inside, jiving around."
Mr. Brocia said that a lot of the fun at a wedding of this type was about competition. "We outdid ourselves," he said. "We just showed them up."

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In / Lincoln Park in Yonkers;
A Convenient Slice of Middle America

BYLINE: By MARY McALEER VIZARD 

 BODY:
KEVIN GORMAN and his wife, Marie, have just passed the kind of landmark that most people can only dream about: They have lived in their Lincoln Park home long enough to have just made their last mortgage payment.
"It's been 25 years," Mr. Gorman said, "And I'm going to burn that mortgage."
Now that they have reached that occasion, the couple, who raised two daughters in their three-bedroom Cape Cod in the Yonkers neighborhood, have no intention of moving, at least for now. 
 "Not while I'm still working," said Mr. Gorman, who is an import specialist with the United States Customs Service. He commutes every day in a car pool to the World Trade Center.
"I've always liked Lincoln Park for its proximity to Manhattan," he said. "When we were shopping for homes, we looked at Orange County and other places, but this was much more convenient."
In many ways, Lincoln Park is a typical Yonkers neighborhood. "It's not the most affluent," said Lee Ellman, the city's Director of Planning. "It's right in the middle, sort of a 'Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House' kind of place."
Sandwiched between major thoroughfares such as Central Park Avenue and McLean Avenue, Lincoln Park exists as a distinct residential oasis of tree-lined streets. Even though the Gov. Thomas E. Dewey Thruway is just east of the neighborhood, there is surprisingly little noise or traffic on the streets, which resemble those of a small middle-American town far removed from normal bustle of southern Westchester County.
Mr. Gorman said that one of Lincoln Park's main attractions for him and his family is the ability to walk to local shopping.
The major shopping district is McLean Avenue, where there are a variety of bakeries, delicatessens and restaurants, like the popular Mannion's Restaurant, an Irish pub that caters to the recent influx of Irish immigrants.
Some establishments have reputations that extend far beyond the immediate neighborhood, such as the Lincoln Park Pastry Shop, which makes the "best rugelach in Yonkers," Mr. Ellman said.
Margo Bennett, who has her own real estate business in Dobbs Ferry, just opened another office in Yonkers last month. "I'm a Yonkers resident and my husband has been in the city forever," she said. "I wanted to also sell in the city." She considers Lincoln Park an urban type of suburban neighborhood -- "Riverdale-like," she said, referring to the upscale section of the northwest Bronx.
The average price of a house is in the low $200,000's and the high end hits the upper $300,000's, Ms. Bennett said. Most houses were built on small lots in the 20's, 30's and 40's. They are primarily Tudors and brick colonials, with a smaller number of ranches that came in after World War II.
One current listing is for a three-bedroom, one-and-a-half-bath brick colonial built in 1940 and selling for $225,000. "The average price at Lincoln Park is perfect for young families," Ms. Bennett said. "And we're getting a lot moving in from the Bronx. They prefer the neighborhood to many others since it's so convenient."
A lot of buyers these days are of Irish or Italian extraction, she said. "They're attracted to the two parochial grammar schools," St. John the Baptist and St. Paul the Apostle, both Roman Catholic grammar schools, serving grades pre-k through 8.
Both schools offer a core academic curriculum, as well as music, art and computer classes. St. John has an enrollment of 360 students, with an annual tuition of $1,900; at the 350-student St. Paul the tuition is $2,400.
THE Stein Yeshiva of Lincoln Park, which was established in 1984, recently moved to a new ranch-style building at Wendover Road and Central Park Avenue. The yeshiva has eight classrooms, office space, a library, a lunchroom and a playground. There are plans to add a gym and additional classroom space to handle larger-than-expected enrollment.
The school, which goes from kindergarten through eighth grade and accepts both boys and girls, started with 30 students and now has more than 140. Until the new space is added, some classes are being held at the Lincoln Park Jewish Center. The yeshiva declined to disclose its tuition.
At one time, Lincoln Park was a predominantly Jewish neighborhood, according to Elliot Palais, who, with his wife, Lorraine, has lived there since 1961.
"In many ways the neighborhood hasn't changed all that much," Mr. Palais said, "but now it's much more mixed, and there are very few Jewish families anymore." Mr. Palais is president of the Lincoln Park Jewish Center, which is also a synagogue and has been a neighborhood fixture for over 60 years.
"We've lost a lot of Jewish families over the years," Mr. Palais said. "They retired and moved away and we're not getting the young families." Thirty years ago, the center had a membership of about 500 families, Mr. Palais said. "Now there are between 90 to 100 and they're aging," he added.
At one time, the local public elementary school, called School 21, was a prime attraction for young families to Lincoln Park. "It was the cream of the crop," Mrs. Palais said. "It gave out the most Regents scholarships."
In 1986, in response to a Federal Court order requiring Yonkers to desegregate its schools, the city revamped the entire system, replacing neighborhood schools with a magnet program in which parents can send their children to any school in the district, if space is available.
All the schools specialize in particular subjects and students are bused in from other areas. The two public schools in Lincoln Park are School 21, for grades pre-K to 5, and the Lincoln High School of Economics and Finance.
School 21 focuses on the teaching of foreign languages and multicultural education. "We teach Spanish and Italian, and the foreign language teachers participate not only in the language classes, but in the regular academic classes too," said Ana Celia Delgado, the school's principal.
School 21 also emphasizes reading, Ms. Delgado added, and has a 40-minute silent reading period first thing every morning. Last year, the school also had a sixth-grade class, which has now moved to the middle-school level.
"Ninety percent of our sixth-grade students last year tested above average in the state's standardized reading and math exams," Ms. Delgado said.
The Lincoln High School of Economics and Finance requires a core curriculum of mathematics, applied mathematics, science, humanities and foreign languages; all subjects are taught in relation to the business world.
The school offers advanced-placement courses in Spanish, English, calculus, biology, United States history and government.
For some of Lincoln Park's longtime residents, small changes can loom large. "It doesn't have the same quality of life it once did," Mr. Palais said. "For instance people never used to park in front of other people's homes. But that's a little thing. Otherwise it's pretty much the same."
The stateliest homes in Lincoln Park are near the Jewish Center, according to Anthony D'Apice, of D'Apice Realty. There, Georgian brick colonials and Tudors stand on green knolls overlooking streets seemingly with as little traffic as there might have been when the houses were first built 50 or more years ago.
"I think people bought them or had them built there so they could walk to the temple," Mr. D'Apice said. Moving out from the Lincon park Jewish Center, the homes get a little smaller and closer together, he added.
SOME streets have almost all Tudor homes. Then just around the corner and there are streets of colonials. In the 1990 census, there were 1,726 households in the neighborhood, 65 percent built in 1949 or earlier, 82 percent in 1959 or earlier. "Those numbers haven't changed that much," said Mr. Ellman, the Director of Planning. "There hasn't been a whole lot of new construction since then."
Although not exactly in the neighborhood, Lincoln Park residents can easily walk to Tibbetts Brook Park, a 161-acre recreation center run by the county. It has six tennis courts, picnic tables, lake skating and fishing, ballfields, hiking and biking trails, miniature golf and a swimming pool.
There's also the much more modest, but popular, one-and-a half-acre Conor Jr. Park, on McLean Avenue, which is run by the city. It also has tennis courts, as well as a children's playground and basketball courts.
The park, which dominates a major entry point into Lincoln Park from Central Park Avenue, recently underwent a $200,000 renovation, including new landscaping, playground equipment and basketball courts.
"It was time," said Mitchell Tutoni, one of the city's park commissioners. "The park gets a lot of use from people of all ages. It's very popular with seniors, who like to sit on the benches in the passive green space on McLean Avenue. You can see them all day long in the nice weather. And the young people use the ballfields and basketball courts. It's really a neighborhood park in the truest sense of that word."

WHAT'S IN A NAME?: The City of Yonkers is not sure how or when Lincoln Park got its name. "But there was a Lincoln station nearby on the old Putnam division of the New York Central Railroad," said Jeffrey Williams, principal planner for Yonkers, adding that trains started operating on the Putnam line in 1881. "Before being called Lincoln Park, the neighborhood was known as Hillview." There might be a Civil War connection, since several roadways -- Sedgwick, Sherman and Lee Avenues -- are named for Civil War-era generals. A short entry in "Place Names of Westchester County, N.Y.," however, says that Lincoln Park is an 1893 developer's name for the area between Sedgwick and Central Park Avenues, south of McLean Avenue. "The Lincoln station on the Putnam division was opened shortly thereafter," the entry says. There is also a .55-acre park, formerly called Memorial Park, acquired by the city in 1921, southeast of South Broadway and McLean, the site of a monument to Abraham Lincoln. The park is now called Lincoln Park.

HEADLINE: As Gas Prices Fall, East End Feels Left Out

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KIGGEN MILLER 

 BODY:
IF East Enders have the impression that they are in their own little world out there, this time they may be right. While the rest of the country is enjoying gasoline prices that, adjusted for inflation, are the lowest since the 1950's, on the East End prices are among the highest in the nation.
State Assemblyman Fred W. Thiele Jr., Republican of Sag Harbor, said so many people on the East End have complained to him about the prices that he has asked the State Consumer Protection Board to investigate. 
 The national average retail price for regular unleaded gasoline is about 93.5 cents a gallon and has been steadily declining for three months, according to the Department of Energy. On the Island, the average price in Nassau County is $1.06, while Suffolk County's average is $1.09.
But Mr. Thiele has found that prices are from 15 to 20 cents per gallon higher in the five East End towns of Riverhead, Southampton, Easthampton, Shelter Island, and Southold. Those lofty prices can be found consistently in only one other place in the continental United States: California, mainly around San Francisco, where the Lundberg Survey, a California company that tracks gasoline prices, says the average price is $1.20 a gallon.
"The cost of living here is high, but it's not enough in my mind to justify differences of what may be as much as 35 cents a gallon," Mr. Thiele said. "People have a right to know why their gas is so expensive."
Good luck finding out. A Mobil station in Southampton is selling regular gasoline for $1.19 a gallon. In Bridgehampton, a BP station is selling it for $1.29, and it's $1.25 at a Sag Harbor Getty station. None of the East End gasoline stations contacted for this article would comment about their prices. Mobil Oil, which has several stations on the East End, wouldn't explain the higher prices except to say that they are affected by real estate costs, taxes, salaries, transportation of gas from terminals, and competitive conditions in the area.
Duncan MacKenzie, a spokesman for the New York State Petroleum Council, a trade association representing the major oil companies and a division of the American Petroleum Institute in Washington, said local gas prices were indicative of the cost of living for each area.
"It's unfair to single out gasoline," Mr. MacKenzie said. "All consumer goods in that area are going to be higher."
Consumers have a much simplier explanation.
"They're really milking the public," said Robert Callendar of Southampton, who has complained to Mr. Thiele about the prices. "It's always been this way and there's no business logic for it."
Mr. Thiele said that major oil companies may be operating under the impression that East End residents are affluent and can pay more.
"We know that the median income on the East End of Long Island is lower than the rest of Long Island," he said.
Tim Ryan, a spokesman for Suffolk County Executive Robert Gaffney, said East End prices were in some cases lower than western Suffolk, pointing to a survey completed last month by the Suffolk County Executive's Office of Consumer Affairs of 52 retail gasoline stations in Suffolk.
"If we're talking about the five East End towns being higher than the rest of the county, that's simply not true," Mr. Ryan said, referring to a Consumer Affairs survey of gasoline prices.
The New York and Long Island region are subject to Federal E.P.A. regulations requiring an additional process called reformulation, by which gas is made to burn cleaner, according to Steve LaFever, a spokesman for the State Consumer Protection Board. The reformulation process is required because of poor air quality in the region, adding to cost of retail gasoline prices, he said.
However, Mr. Ryan said the reformulation regulations apply to the entire region, not just to the East End, so they affect prices equally. "There is absolutely no correlation between any environmental rules and prices on the East End" he said. "Everything just costs more on the East End."
Although the consumer board can investigate the pricing, it has no enforcement powers. But the State Attorney General does, who Mr. Thiele also plans to notify. Scott Brown, a spokesman for the Attorney General's office, said it could only act if there was evidence that stations were colluding on prices, and no one is accusing gas dealers of that. Otherwise, there is little the Attorney General can do.
"I think there's a lack of competition here, but to me, there's an element of gouging in that," Mr. Thiele said. "If you're charging higher prices just simply because you think you can get away with it, that's unfair."
Federal and state taxes account for about 50 cents per gallon of retail gas prices, but there is no standard markup for gas dealers, Mr. MacKenzie said. "If they want to charge $5 a gallon and they can get it, that's their prerogative," he said.
Ed Lincoln, assistant manager at the Southampton Mobile station on Route 27, agrees that gasoline prices on the East End average 20 cents higher, but said he could not explain why.
"Once you pass the Shinnecock Canal, there are higher prices," he said. "I don't know why. People are commenting, but not complaining. We're selling a lot of gas, so we must be doing something right."

HEADLINE: Q&A/Nancy Wyman;
One Woman's Passion for the Budget

BYLINE: By NANCY POLK 

 BODY:
WHEN State Comptroller Nancy Wyman was asked what book she had read most recently, she answered, "The state budget," what she describes as an "exciting and interesting" operation.
In her years in the legislature representing the Tolland area, Ms. Wyman has fought hard for generally accepted accounting practices, what she calls "truth in budgeting," to replace what she scornfully calls "this thing called a modified cash basis." (She explained that it is a system that permits the delay of major payments in order to show an artificial surplus.) 
 She will again propose to the Governor and the legislature that generally accepted accounting practices, mandated by the state but not followed by municipalities, be adopted. "I am very tight with the taxpayer's money," she said. But she has also been an outspoken advocate for better funding in education and health care. She was first, she says, to propose a children's health plan, now known as the Husky Plan, but she said, "the media credited the Governor." Would she like credit? "Sure!"
She is the first woman in the comptroller's job, having entered politics via the Tolland Parent Teachers Organization, then the school board. Next she ran successfully for the State House where she served for eight years.
"When asked what I wanted to do next I said 'Comptroller'," she recalled. "The response was 'You mean Secretary of State, don't you?' " She laughs. No, her passion is the number crunch. She is pleased to see more woman entering state government in Connecticut. "What you see are young men and older women," she explained, the women having taken time first to raise children.
Recently Comptroller Wyman met to discuss the state's economy. Following are excerpts from that conversation:
 
Q. What does the State Comptroller do?
 
A. I am considered the fiscal guardian for the state. I basically take care of the health care and benefits for all the state's employees. I purchase health care for 166,000 people -- 50,000 state employees, their families, retirees and their families. We're the people who really keep an eye on how the money is being spent in the state. We put out a monthly report that talks about where we are and what it looks like for the rest of the year and a year's report in January that covers the entire year and looks to the future.
 
Q. How is the financial health of Connecticut?
 
A. Of course we concentrate a lot on the debt. After all, we are the highest debt per capita in the country. As far as our economy, we look pretty good right now. We will have a surplus at the end of the year again. What we are seeing is a slowdown of the revenues coming in.
Last year at this time we had already brought in about 13 percent more in revenues from income taxes. Now we're at about 5 1/2 percent more. That's because we are now very low on unemployment. Before we were putting people on new jobs all the time. Right now it is bottoming out for us.
Before when we had the major layoffs, income tax revenues were way down. Now they are coming up. The interesting part is corporation taxes are doing pretty well even with the cutbacks we've been doing.
 
Q. Is there something we should be doing to take advantage of the good times to protect us from another cycle of economic uncertainty?
 
A. My biggest fear is that during good times we have not done the revamping that we should have been doing. We have let things go instead of looking for cost savings and efficiencies in government because the revenues have been so high. We're sitting pretty.
So when the times are good we cut taxes. We don't put our hand in your pocket. But when the state is in trouble, that usually means you the taxpayer are in trouble. We come back and increase your taxes. We'd like to see a much steadier flat pattern so we don't have these games.
 
Q. What are some cost savings you can see?
 
A. About a year and a half ago the Federal Government gave us leeway to deal with Medicaid and Medicare. We started to study it. I guess it got too confusing for the Governor's people and they let it drop. Health care is one of the biggest costs in our state budget not only for our state employees but for the Medicaid population. That's one thing we could have done and should have done for the people of the state.
 
Q. Is the Medicaid population that financially significant for the state?
 
A. It's about a $2 billion portion of our budget. Over $1 billion of that is going to our senior citizens' nursing homes. Most people think that it's the poor person in Hartford or New Haven that's on Medicaid. It's not. The majority of Medicaid goes to the senior citizens in nursing homes.
My big push is for people to buy long-term health care insurance now. Talk about efficiency in government, this is a long-term efficiency. You might not see savings today but in the long run, if you can keep people at home with an insurance policy, they won't change over to Medicaid so quickly. And it will improve the quality of life for seniors.
 
Q. Are Connecticut's computers ready for the year 2000?
 
A. The Governor had a force of people come into each agency to determine how much it would cost to ready the state's computer systems for the year 2000. One of the estimates was $6 million for my agency. My people said, "Please Nancy give us a chance. Let us try. We think we can purchase systems and it won't cost you nearly that much."
In fact two out of our three systems are up and running and have been for the last five or six months. The third system will be running by the end of this month or beginning of February. It will cost us no more than $700,000. That's over $5 million in savings for the people of the state.
My question is: "What's happening in those other agencies?" We sent out a note offering to help out with the year 2000. I don't know if it's politics but they all stayed away.
 
Q. Why are you suing Blue Cross/ Blue Shield?
 
A. Blue Cross/Blue Shield has changed. When they started in this state well over 50 years ago, they were a not-for-profit. So the state gave them a lot of breaks -- tax breaks, hospital breaks, many different areas, because they were a charitable type of organization.
They went to a mutual company in 1985-86. Now they are for-profit since Anthem came in and bought them. They had a major surplus of about $270 million. What they want to do is shift the money that they have from tax breaks and the surplus to Indiana. We are saying "No." That money should at least stay in the state of Connecticut and be used for our policyholders.
About 78 percent of people in state government have Blue Cross/Blue Shield. My husband and I also have a small policy which makes me a policy holder. So I thought in my position I could fight for the policyholders in the State.
There are two lawsuits going one. The other is from the Attorney General's office. We should be getting money one way or the other.
 
Q. Did you support the tax rebate?
 
A. We came up with this because I believe in keeping the financial status firm and straightforward. If you look at business profit at the end of the year, the stockholders usually get a refund. Our original proposal said No. 1, you fill the Rainy Day Fund which is like a savings account, then second you take 80 percent of that money and give it back as a rebate and the rest put toward retiring the debt.
We came out with it months before the Governor, but because he does get much more press than the Comptroller does, the Governor picked it up and ran with it. There were many Democrats who were not happy with it and many Republicans who were not happy with it but I believe rebates should be permanent.
 
Q. What happened to the lottery money earmarked for education?
 
A. Ella Grasso wanted to bring in lottery tickets to the State. The only way she could do it was to say that the money would be dedicated to education. That's how she sold it. Of course that's the one statement that Ella Grasso made that anyone who lived in the state at that time has never forgotten.
We only get about $700,000 from the scratch tickets. The Mashantucket and Mohegan gambling money is dedicated to the municipalities to keep their budgets balanced.
We spend over $2 billion in this state on education. The lottery money is basically in the general fund and we pay for education out of the general fund.
 
Q. Will Connecticut ever abolish the state income tax?
 
A. There is no way that anybody can come in and abolish the state income tax. If it wasn't for the state income tax the Governor wouldn't be getting his Patriots right now. We overspent our budget the last two years exceeding the cap on spending. The only way we could do that is because revenue is coming in. Most of our revenue comes in from the state income tax.

HEADLINE: Making Films, Making Waves

BYLINE: By KATE STONE LOMBARDI 

 BODY:
LIGHTS! Camera! Complaints! When the thrill of film production gives way to the reality of traffic jams, generators and klieg lights, some residents, particularly those in small towns and villages, find themselves less than star struck. Reflecting what many Manhattan neighborhoods have been complaining about for years, some municipalities are seeking to limit the disruption that can come with movie, television and commercial production in their neighborhoods.
The reaction comes at a time when the county has been aggressively courting the film industry and partly reflects its success. Cities, towns and villages have been host to a variety of feature productions. The county's Film Bureau estimates that the movie business will bring more than $10 million into Westchester this year. County Executive Andrew J. Spano views the industry as an important component in the county's economic development and earlier this year reinstituted the Film Bureau, which had been disbanded in 1995 by Andrew P. O'Rourke, the County Executive then. 
 To be sure, many municipalities are delighted to be the site of commercial productions. Yonkers has been nicknamed Westchester's Tinseltown and was recently described in a cover story in Daily Variety in Hollywood as a hot spot for filmmaking. New Rochelle has been the host to 18 commercial shoots this year, ranging from commercials to feature films. And movie making has not lost its glamour. Even the most jaded resident can get excited about a Harrison Ford or Woody Allen sighting.
Further, make-believe can be unexpectedly charming. Last month travelers at the County Airport saw fall foliage on the trees in front of the terminal -- even though it was a nude December day. A production company had attached fake leaves to the bare branches to film a scene for the movie "Random Hearts," which stars Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott Thomas. The filming, which had been delayed, was meant to re-create Manchester Airport in New Hampshire in the fall.
As the movie industry becomes a bigger presence in the county, municipalities have been challenged to balance the interests of movie producers with the needs of residents. Towns often stand to make substantial fees by allowing filming on their streets; at the same time they face aggravated residents who do not appreciate being told they cannot walk down those streets during filming.
"People move into these towns for the quality of life," said Mayor Sean Treacy of Sleepy Hollow, which has been host to several film projects. "The question we have to ask is, Is it right to disrupt that for additional monies to the municipality?"
Each of Westchester's 44 municipalities has its own regulations concerning commercial filming. Most charge fees and regulate traffic, parking and the hours filming is permitted. Some also require advance notification of residents concerning a production. To expedite business for production companies, Iris Stevens, the County Film Bureau's liaison, has published a guide, which includes each town's requirements. She said films always bring money into a municipality.
"It has a wonderful ripple effect throughout the community that these films are in," Ms. Stevens said. "Money goes into pet community projects. Money goes into the police DARE fund, building funds. When they run out of paint, they go to the hardware store. They use local delis. They rent V.F.W. halls. It's a nice chunk of money."
Sleepy Hollow was expecting just such a windfall when the village was negotiating with Universal Studios over the filming of "One True Thing," which starred Meryl Streep. Village officials and studio personnel worked out a contract with 42 clauses, which, among other things, had the film company paying $1,000 a day to the village, $500 to the local garden club and $20,000 to a neighborhood project.
The filming, however, never happened in Sleepy Hollow. Residents balked at night filming in a residential neighborhood, objecting to the expected noise, traffic and lighting. The homeowner across the street from the location refused to allow the production crew access to his property, and in frustration, the studio withdrew its application. The movie was later shot in New Jersey.
"We were living diagonally across from the location, and they were going to be shooting overnight," Klaus Schmidt of Sleepy Hollow said. "I'm certainly not against shooting movies, but this created some sticky problems. There were going to be numerous trucks, generators and lights. The movie company was pretty arrogant about it. They told us they would give us dark curtains, and if it really bothered us, they would put us up in a hotel. They were so darn sure that everyone would say, 'Oh, wonderful!' "
Hastings-on-Hudson commands one of the highest fees for filming: $1,500 a day and other requirements, including paying for off-duty police officers, posting a bond and signing contracts with merchants, who also receive a fee when filming takes place downtown. "We require any production company to jump through a lot of hoops to be able to film here," Neil Hess, the Village Manager, said.
When H.B.O. went to Hastings last month to film "Earthly Possessions," starring Susan Sarandon, which was also filmed in New Rochelle and Yonkers, they paid the village $20,000 altogether. Susan Maggiotto, Deputy Manager for Hastings, said the feature that makes Hastings attractive to movie producers -- the quaint, old-time look of the village -- also makes production difficult to manage.
"Our little downtown is very concentrated and bordered on one side by the river," Ms. Maggiotto said. "There are very few choices of egress. In New York City, if you're blocked, fine, you go another way. In Hastings, there's just one way to get where you're going, and if you can't go that way, you're stuck."
Ms. Maggiotto said that some merchants did not see the benefit of film production. "They say that the crews come in with their own food trucks, so they're not in the local delis," she said. "All they see is that their own customers can't get to their stores."
The manager of Hastings Video disagreed, saying she greatly enjoyed seeing her small town transformed for the filming of "Earthly Possessions." Stores were dressed up with new fronts, and a rain machine produced drizzle in front of her store.
"It was fun," Dorothy Honovich-Kavanah, the video store manager, said. "Our store became Get Away Travel. The architect firm next door became a bank. The bank was made into a funeral home. And Susan Sarandon was lovely and gracious. It was really a nice thing to happen here."
A Hastings resident, Linda Atkinson, was trying to run errands on the day "Earthly Possessions" was being filmed. "You're trying to go about your daily business and some young kid comes up and says, 'Excuse me, you're not allowed on this side of the street,' " she said. "And you want to say, 'Excuse me, but I live here and I need to go to the video store and the bank.' "
Ms. Atkinson, an actress and a documentary film producer, said she knew the industry all too well. One recent morning she found a young woman in her front yard. The woman said she represented a film producer who was interested in using the house next door for a location.
"Being in the industry, I know my neighbor is excited because she's going to make a couple of thousand bucks, but I know we're talking about 20 trucks maybe, miles of cables, and you're talking about people that don't mind walking in your yard or stepping on your lilac bush," Ms. Atkinson said.
Ms. Stevens, of the county film office, said that film crews are now taking a much more respectful attitude toward private property. "I've monitored most of the productions that have gone on here," she said. "Part of my job is to protect Westchester County. I have seen a real change. There's a softer, gentler production community, which is much more mannerly."
Ms. Stevens said that some municipalities greatly desire filming and some abhor it, and there was little in between. One community that has seen little production is Armonk in the town of North Castle. Supervisor John A. Lombardi of North Castle said, "This is not a neighborhood where people feel they need the income for the community." He said even the possibility of opening a four-screen movie theater in the town raised residents' hackles.
Coincidentally, many of the communities that are home to movie stars have the strictest filming ordinances. Supervisor John R. Dinin of the town of Bedford -- where Glenn Close, Chevy Chase and Richard Gere live, among others -- said: "Basically, we don't look at this municipality as a great revenue source. While we don't mind filming, this is first and foremost someone's residence." Mr. Dinin said he has had requests ranging from taking over the entire hamlet of Katonah and blocking it from traffic to having buses explode.
Pound Ridge, which is home to Christopher Reeve, Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, recently updated its filming ordinance, adding fines for noncompliance. Supervisor Joy G. Simpkins said that Pound Ridge was happy to work with film companies but added that production must be controlled.
The new regulations prompted the local weekly newspaper, The Patent Trader, to run an editorial titled, "That's Telling Them," which said, "Maybe they can get away with high-handed behavior in Hollywood, but in northern Westchester, we all know who owns the world, and it isn't some outfit with a camera."
This kind of talk is discouraging for Ms. Stevens, whose job it is to encourage film making in the county, but she takes it in stride. Ms. Stevens said: "This is a business of extremes, and that's how the towns are. They either love it or they hate it. Some communities really don't care if it's the Pope -- no filming allowed, period. But if I can't get access to one community, there's always another that looks like it or that can stand in for it. And there are plenty of places that welcome movies and the economic development they bring."

HEADLINE: In the Region / New Jersey;
In the Last 2 Years, Rental Construction Spurts

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
FOR most of the last decade rental apartments were the wallflowers of the residential market in northern and central New Jersey, where production of such housing had slowed to a trickle.
But in the last two years developers have renewed their interest in building apartments, seizing what they say is an opportunity to build upscale rentals in urban areas that until now were unable to accept such units and in suburban markets that until recently resisted them. 
 While the focus is on the Hudson River shoreline, rentals are sprouting in urban areas like Morristown and New Brunswick, as well as in suburban towns like Westwood.
"There has been a dramatic increase in rentals," said Paul J. Kaliades, president of the New Jersey Apartment Association, a trade group in East Brunswick. "But the new starts just begin to bring balance back to the rental equation, which has been imbalanced since the condo conversion craze of the last decade took lots of units off the market."
State figures show the number of housing permits issued for rental units last year was 3,994, or about 13 percent of the total of 29,795 permits issued. In 1997, 3,201 permits were issued for rentals, or about 11 percent of the total number of 30,357 housing permits.
Much of the recent activity is the work of three companies: Avalon Bay Communities, a real estate investment trust based in Alexandria, Va., whose only business is developing rentals; the 30-year-old Applied Companies of Hoboken, which started out building affordable rentals in Hudson County and switched in the mid-80's to market-rate rentals, and the Roseland Property Company, a five-year-old firm based in Roseland that builds mostly rentals as well as housing for the elderly and detached houses.
The companies are building or will build over the next 18 months a total of 6,500 rental units.
Several factors are motivating these and other builders to put up rentals, including the state's strong economy and housing market.
The ripple effect from Manhattan's rental market also cannot be overlooked, Mr. Kaliades said, noting that the rental vacancy rate in northern and central New Jersey was 5 percent.
Another factor is the availability of financing. "Apartments remain an investment vehicle of choice," said Steven D. Heller, senior vice president at Arcs Commercial Mortgage Company of Princeton. "Central and northern New Jersey, where there are wall-to-wall people building apartments, are as safe bets as you can get."
But, Mr. Heller said, challenges persist that will keep the field of players limited and demand ahead of supply. They include the scarcity of properly zoned sites and high construction and land costs. Many municipalities also continue to resist rentals because they are perceived as taxing local resources, especially schools.
SOME of the new projects are rising on once commercially zoned land. Others are being developed as a result of towns' wanting -- or being forced through builder lawsuits -- to meet their obligations under the state's Mount Laurel doctrines, which require municipalities to provide opportunities for developing housing for people making 50 to 80 percent of the median income in the area.
Analysts expect 1999 to be another good year for the state's rental market. Officials at Avalon, Applied and Roseland, like other developers, said they will stay the course because of the unmet demand from people who choose not to or cannot buy.
Roseland started out acquiring reclaimed properties from lenders. But in the last two years it has made the transition to a private development company that concentrates on rentals "because even though they are harder to do and require a lot of capital, there is little vacancy and turnover in the northern and central New Jersey market," said Marshall B. Tycher, Roseland's president.
Roseland, which secures its financing from pension funds and insurance companies, is building 2,000 apartments in northern New Jersey and will be developing 1,000 more over the next year. With the land it now owns, Roseland has the potential to build more than 6,000 units.
Two projects under way are on the Hudson River shoreline in West New York: the Landings at Port Imperial with 276 units and Riverbend at Port Imperial with 1,032 apartments. They are rising on the 100 acres the company owns and plans to develop into a community with 4,200 residences.
"We cut our teeth on the waterfront in Hudson County," Mr. Tycher said, "Now the issue is to build in the suburbs outside of Hudson so we are picking markets where the rents are at a premium to offset the high construction costs."
To that end Roseland is building a 216-unit complex in Westwood in Bergen County, where no new rentals have been built in 20 years. It also has a development under way in South Plainfield with 252 apartments, 15 percent of them Mount Laurel units.
Most of the apartments Roseland builds have one and two bedrooms and 775 to 1,175 square feet of space to appeal to young professionals and empty-nesters rather than families, Mr. Tycher said. Monthly rents for the riverfront units are $1,600 to $2,400 or $2 a square foot. Rents for suburban apartments -- typically 750 square feet for a one-bedroom and 1,050 square feet for a two-bedroom -- are $1,050 and $1,400, respectively, or $1.10 to $1.60 a square foot, he said.
The Applied Companies owns and manages 5,000 rentals, and has some 1,500 units under way or expected to begin in the next 15 months. It also has the potential to build a total of 3,500 units on land it now owns.
Applied, which also is active on the riverfront, has built or is building 350 apartments on the southern waterfront in Hoboken in a project called the Shipyard that will eventually contain 1,160 units. The company, with separate partners, also plans to build 550 more units on Hoboken's southern waterfront and an equal number of units in Fort Lee.
In addition, it also has built or is building projects, each with 100 rentals, in the downtowns of Morristown and New Brunswick. Applied secures its financing from banks, pension funds and institutional partners.
EXPLAINING his company's strategy, David B. Barry, senior vice president at Applied, said: "Our roots are in the urban areas, which allowed us to see the demand for market-rate rentals. That demand is ongoing in cities that offer cultural amenities and infrastructure to support them."
Demographics also favor rentals, Mr. Barry added. He said forecasts were that the number of people in their 20's would increase in the next decade as would the number of empty-nesters -- markets that he said his company courts. Applied builds mainly studio to two-bedroom units with 600 to 1,200 square feet of space. Mr. Barry said riverfront units rent for $2 a square foot or $1,200 to $2,400 a month. Those in Morristown and New Brunswick, which range from 600 to 975 square feet, rent for about $1.50 a square foot, or $900 to $1,460.
"Except for the potential of a short-term slowdown in the absorption of riverfront units," Mr. Barry said, "we think the rental market is a good place to be for the next few years."
Avalon Bay Communities, which has built 2,000 rentals in the state, is now developing 620 additional units in two projects -- one with 351 units in Fort Lee, the other with 269 units on the Jersey City waterfront. In the next 18 months it also plans to build three other projects totaling 1,380 units in Florham Park, Freehold and Edgewater.
"Our strategy is to create a dominance," said Gwyneth J. Cote, a regional vice president at the company. With the new projects, she said, Avalon will have four projects each in and around the Route 1 corridor in central New Jersey and along the shoreline in Hudson and Bergen Counties.
The company also is known for pushing the envelope on rents. At Avalon Cove, its 504-unit community along the Jersey City waterfront, the one- to four-bedroom units, rent for $1,700 to $4,650 a month, or $2 to $2.20 a square foot -- the highest rents achieved so far.
"In good times and bad our philosophy does not change," Ms. Cote said. "We're in the luxury market and there will always be people willing to pay for a quality apartment, especially in northern and central New Jersey where, like the rest of the metropolitan New York region, the demand is high and the supply is thin."

HEADLINE: In the Region / Connecticut;
Casino Traffic Pointing Way to Revival in Norwich

BYLINE: By By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
JOHN M. SMITH, the third generation of his family to run the Cranston Company in downtown Norwich, decided 16 years ago to move his art gallery and framing business out of the downtown and into a strip mall in the Norwichtown section.
"Downtown had a lot of the same problems that every other downtown had -- parking was not convenient, a lot of buildings were not being kept up and it just wasn't a good place to do business," Mr. Smith recalls. "So we left." But late last year, he moved back, into a 2,800-square-foot building at 100 Water Street newly renovated by the Norwich Museum Trust, a group that is working with the city and other groups to breathe life back into the downtown. 
 "I don't think I've ever seen a community so focused on revitalizing its downtown," Mr. Smith said.
City Manager William Tallman is anxious for the start of four projects that will invest almost $50 million in the downtown, including two new hotels, a transportation center and an artists' complex with apartments and galleries. Construction on the projects is to start in the next several months.
"The town has never really thought well of itself, the feeling was it was second class, and it always would be, and second class was good enough," Mr. Tallman said. "That's changed. I think there's a renewed sense of pride, the City Council is very aggressive about revitalization, and everyone is working together."
Meg Malmborg, the city's tourism director and head of its Main Street Project, said the city had not only placed more emphasis on attracting new businesses but also cracked down on blighted buildings, forcing owners to make improvements or give them up. Norwich has also invested in new sidewalks, street lamps and other amenities and is working with private organizations, regional groups and state agencies. Formerly, initiatives might have focused in one area or been undertaken by one group.
"In the past, I don't think anyone realized how hydra-headed this problem was," Mrs. Malmborg said. "You can't just attack one of the problems, you have to do it holistically, and that's what we're doing now."
To be sure, the projects envisioned would represent the revitalization of only the core of the downtown, with the hope of other projects to follow.
Ted S. Montgomery, executive vice president of the Norwich Community Development Corporation, said the city hoped that the interest in the downtown would spread to other parts of Norwich. His organization has obtained a $100,000 state grant to study expansion of the city's 450-acre industrial park by up to 200 acres.
"The downtown is like the ego of the community -- people judge you a lot on the looks of your downtown," Mr. Montgomery said. "People have to realize that the downtown affects the entire community."
In the 18th and 19th centuries, Norwich was affluent, with a deep-water port on the Thames River giving it access to Long Island Sound and with a number of rivers powering textile and other mills that are still there, though largely vacant.
For much of the last half of this century, however, it declined as the mills closed and trading moved away. Today the city of 36,000 in eastern Connecticut is experiencing a rebirth -- once again partly resulting from its location. Norwich is only a few miles west of the Foxwoods Resort Casino operated by the Mashantucket Pequot tribe and a few miles north of the Mohegan Sun Casino of the Mohegan Pequots. Much of the renewed interest in downtown Norwich stems from the traffic through the region generated by the two casinos.
The Mashantuckets have also demolished five decrepit buildings in the downtown in what was once known as the Mercantile Exchange to make way for an $18 million, 100,000-square-foot development that will include a 120-room hotel, retail space and a restaurant. "The tribe has a number of members who have personally invested in downtown Norwich, and have committed to helping revitalize the city," said Susann Viafora, a tribal spokeswoman. "The feeling is, what's good for the community is good for the tribe, and vice versa."
ARTSPACE L.L.C., which opened an apartment building in Hartford in 1997 that drew 400 applications for 48 units, is finishing up plans for a $7.5 million renovation of the city-owned former Goldberg building at Chestnut and Franklin Streets, and the Konover Investment Corporation is planning a $12 million to $15 million renovation of the former Wauregan Hotel at Broadway and Main Street.
"Time and the weather have not been kind to the building," David H. Kagan, executive vice president of Konover Investment, said of the Wauregan, which was a luxury hotel in the 19th century. "The roof has been open to the elements for some time, so the majority of the interior is going to be a complete rebuild. But we hope to save the original facade and some of the architectural treatments."
The company has uncovered photographs of the hotel in its glory days, and will seek to do a faithful restoration, with about 60 rooms and a ballroom. Although two new hotels have opened in Norwich in the last few years, a Comfort Suites and a Marriott Courtyard, Mr. Kagan does not expect to compete with them.
"This is not going to be a Ramada or a Motel 6," he said. "It's going to be upscale, one of a kind, with period antiques in the rooms and lobby and the feel of a grand European boutique hotel."
The state has put up most of the money for a $7 million transportation center near the viaduct at the southeast edge of downtown, a complex that will bring together rail, taxi, bus and ferry service.
Besides the four projects going through the final approval process, a number of others are on the drawing board. The largest involves the other casino operator, the Mohegans, who are discussing with the city a proposal for a $9 million technology center in the former Masonic building on Broadway.
Ronald Aliano, a local businessman who founded a successful ambulance company 27 years ago, then built an upscale marina on the harbor in 1987, a new restaurant on the waterfront two years later and a miniature golf course three years ago, is now renovating an Art Deco building on Main Street. "If the marina hadn't been done, I think it would have been a lot more difficult to get people interested in the downtown," Mr. Aliano said. "That whole area was an eyesore. Now, it's time for other projects to move forward.
"If you look at the architectural detail, Norwich clearly was very vibrant at one point. It's just a matter of putting it all back together. We've always talked about the great potential of Norwich. Hopefully, with the Mashantuckets' development, and Konover doing a hotel, and all the other work that's happening, it will be a catalyst for even more."
The question now is whether the development proposals will spark even more interest in the downtown, Mrs. Malmborg said. She is preparing a request for proposals for a restaurant in a former city firehouse in the downtown. Already, six restaurant operators have asked to be notified when it is ready, she said.
"That will be a good indicator whether there's any interest from outside the area, whether all that's happening is really attracting new business," Mrs. Malmborg said. "I think a lot of people are still waiting to see the actual buildings going up, though, before they are ready to jump in."

HEADLINE: There's Money to Spend But Priorities Differ

BYLINE: By MIKE ALLEN 

 BODY:
FLUSH from their joint success in landing the New England Patriots, Gov. John G. Rowland and the Democrats who control both houses of the General Assembly were tripping over themselves last week with promises to work together during this year's legislative session. At the same time, however, they have announced conflicting priorities that could mean tense months ahead.
Governor Rowland and his fellow Republicans in the legislature have stressed their desire to put a brake on, or even pare, state spending, while Democrats said they hoped to take advantage of the booming economy to make progress on education and other issues that took a back seat as the state struggled out of the recent recession. 
 Mr. Rowland does not plan to ask for any new big-ticket projects, but he told legislators he would not retreat on any of the major programs passed during his first term, including health coverage for uninsured children, open-space preservation and pollution reduction in Long Island Sound.
The new session, which began Wednesday and runs through June 9, kicked off with good will toward all. Shortly after he was sworn in for a second term, Mr. Rowland told legislators he was eager "to continue that same bipartisan approach that has worked so well for us over the last four years." The Senate President pro tem, Kevin B. Sullivan, Democrat of West Hartford, used his opening address to call for "a spirit of mutual respect that values what each has to offer."
But that was Day 1, and Mr. Sullivan acknowledged in a pre-session briefing that opening day at the State Capitol amounts to dessert. When the Governor delivers his budget on Feb. 10, Mr. Sullivan said, "There's the opportunity for vegetable and other sorts of unsavory things." When the food fight begins, here are some things that will be on the menu:
Senate Democrats announced an agenda, "Common Sense for a New Century," that includes a continuation of the tuition freeze at state colleges and universities, new protections for the privacy of medical records, and aid to school districts for Internet equipment. Some of the potentially more expensive items are a pilot program to cover adults who do not have health insurance (similar to the program for uninsured children), increasing direct student aid for colleges and universities, and improving the availability of mass transit.
"This is one of those years where there is a real opportunity to be responsibly proactive," said the Senate Majority Leader, George C. Jepsen, a Democrat from Stamford. "Sometimes you just have to plug the dike. But this year, because of the strong economy, we're not under pressure."
The new Speaker of the House, Representative Moira K. Lyons, a Democrat also from Stamford, staked out similar ground in her speech accepting her election during the legislature's opening session. "The last General Assembly made strides by improving reading and early-childhood education," she said. "These initiatives should be maintained and strengthened so that all children have the opportunity to succeed."
But a Republican leader of the Senate, Louis C. DeLuca of Woodbury, indicated that his party is headed in a very different direction. Although he, too, said he favors increased spending on education, he said he hoped for an agency-by-agency review, in order to spot areas for cutbacks.
"The danger is that when the times are good we say, 'Well, everything's fine,' " said Mr. DeLuca, the minority leader pro tem. "This is when good businesses cut back and get a little thinner. And then when the bad times come, they can survive. Morning comes! The hangover comes."
House Republicans also issued a formal agenda, topped by tax cuts. "We're not saying they have to be massive," said the House Minority Leader, Representative Robert M. Ward of Northford. "We just think that we need to set the tone that to control the spending, you gradually ratchet taxes down."
The House Republicans also said they want to expand state support for charter and magnet schools, to allow parents more choice, and to increase accountability for teachers and administrators, eliminate automatic promotion and attack habitual truancy by making parents responsible.
The two parties have several areas of overlap in their plans. (Even the packaging blurs the traditional distinctions between the parties. The Senate Democrats' platform is headlined, "Spending restraint, property tax cuts, education, health care top list," while the House Republicans go with, "Republicans Target Income Tax Cuts, Schools, Tuition Freeze, Open Space.")
Both parties want to strengthen the state's Megan's Law, which is supposed to make it possible for citizens to learn if any neighbors are convicted sex offenders. Although regulation of health maintenance organizations was a Democratic campaign issue, Republicans seemed to be jumping on board. House Republicans made it one of their agenda items. And the Senate Minority Leader, M. Adela Eads, a Republican of Kent, said, "The H.M.O.'s need monitoring. I've been getting a lot of mail about this."
This is a year when the legislature will adopt a two-year budget, and one of the most pleasant -- although potentially contentious tasks -- will be deciding how to spend the budget surplus from last year -- which is expected to wind up between $350 million and $500 million. In his State of the State address, Mr. Rowland said he wanted to "cut additional taxes, whenever and wherever possible," and raised the possibility of another tax rebate like the one last year, which his critics had derided as an election-year gimmick.
Democrats seem willing to go along. "Rebates could be part of the final puzzle," Mr. Jepsen said. "It is doesn't mean that some Democratic leaders are going to be out there pushing for them. But if the Governor insists," he said they could be part of a solution.
In Connecticut, Democrats traditionally push for property-tax relief and Republicans prefer income-tax cuts. So while a tax cut is likely, the formula will be hotly debated, and some hybrid is likely to result.
As another use for the surplus, Mr. Jepsen said legislators might try to reduce the long-term cost of the $375-million stadium in Hartford for the New England Patriots by increasing the amount of the surplus that is to be used for a down payment on construction, beyond the $100 million currently planned. That would save the state money in the long run, by reducing the amount that must be borrowed.
This may be the last year when legislators have such a big cushion. In a recent report, the State Comptroller, Nancy Wyman, a Democrat who was inaugurated on Wednesday for a second term, warned, "There are now clear signs that the exceptional revenue growth that we have been experiencing is slowing." (Ms. Wyman talks about state finances in an interview on Page 3.)
Whatever happens, Fairfield County can expect to be looked after as never before now that Representative Lyons of Stamford is the House Speaker, the first woman to hold that office. She promised to continue looking out for the region in the areas of mass transit, highway safety and economic development. Mr. Jepsen, the Senate majority leader, is also from Stamford.
As the session progresses and tempers flare, Senator Sullivan says he has thought of a way to retain the civility that seemed like such a good idea during opening week: "If either the Governor or us stray too much from that," he said, "we're prepared to bring Jesse Ventura in to mediate."

HEADLINE: After a Roller-Coaster Year, Optimism

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
REAL estate executives used words like "frothy" and "giddy" and "frenzy" to describe the investment market in the New York area during the first half of last year. Fueled by a seemingly unlimited amount of capital from Wall Street, real estate investment trusts and private operators bid against each other for available properties, driving up prices.
Today, the froth has flattened and nobody is feeling very giddy. At the same time there is little gloom. 
 Although the capital markets took the industry on a roller-coaster ride last year, the fundamentals of the commercial real estate business remain strong and most executives are optimistic about the coming year.
"We are at the top end of a real estate cycle, so 1999 should be a good year, but not a spectacularly good one," said Dennis Yeskey, managing director of the real estate services group at Deloitte & Touche, the accounting and consulting company.
Michael T. Cohen, president of Williams Real Estate, said that "what we saw last year was a historic disconnect between the rental and sales markets." Mr. Cohen said that commercial rents remained strong even as the prices of properties fluctuated in response to activity in financial markets.
"The good news," said Raymond G. Torto, a principal in Torto Wheaton Research, an econometric analysis firm specializing in real estate, "is that real estate has made it in capital markets," allowing financing to be raised by public stock and bond offerings.
"That is also the bad news," he added, noting that events in foreign countries can affect projects and prices in the United States, regardless of local market conditions.
Real estate investment trusts, known as REIT's, were the first to feel the market's sting, as disenchanted investors drove the prices of their shares down, preventing the REIT's from selling more shares to finance a continuation of their buying binge. The overall stock market also took a sharp lurch downward in August, raising fears of layoffs in financial services companies.
Those worries have not entirely evaporated despite the market's strong showing in recent months.
"We saw that public markets for real estate are quick to go down and slow to recover," said John I. Bralower, the president of Sonnenblick-Goldman, a real estate finance company. "The underlying market for the properties did not go down as much as the stocks."
Meanwhile, recessions in Asia, currency problems in Russia and the near-collapse of a huge American hedge fund shook up the bond market in this country, leaving Wall Street firms unable to convert the mortgage loans they had already purchased into securities.
With widespread uncertainty about the future pricing of mortgage-backed securities, liquidity dried up and sales ground to a halt.
Properties that had been for sale were withdrawn from the market because of uncertainty and declining bids. According to Insignia/ESG, a real estate brokerage and services company, properties that were pulled off the market included the 1.5 million-square-foot building at 450 West 33d Street, the 1.1 million-square-foot structure at 237 Park Avenue, at 45th Street, and the million-square-foot building at 450 Lexington Avenue, at 45th Street.
One transaction that did close reflected the abrupt drop in pricing. The Witkoff Group acquired the Woolworth Building, at 233 Broadway, for $133 million after having successfully reduced its original -- and accepted -- bid of $157 million. The seller was the Venator Group, the successor to the old Woolworth Corporation..
All the time the capital markets were churning, most of the real estate fundamentals were strong, with office vacancies low and rents stable or climbing. According to a year-end report prepared by CB Richard Ellis, a brokerage company, the overall office vacancy rate for Manhattan was 5 percent, with the Midtown North subdistrict, generally defined as 32d to 59th Street, river to river, down to 3.2 percent availability.
Asking annual rents for all classes of multitenanted commercial buildings in Manhattan reached $36.60 a square foot in the fourth quarter, according to the report, compared to $29.96 at the end of 1997. Brokers reported that some prime buildings in key locations, such as 9 West 57th Street and the General Motors building at 767 Fifth Avenue, were fetching as much as $70 to $75 a square foot.
Because of these strong fundamentals, most real estate leaders say they are cautiously optimistic as they head into 1999. The relative lack of new construction in Manhattan will keep office rents high, they say, although builders in New Jersey are betting those rates will drive some companies to their developments along the Hudson River waterfront.
The big layoffs that were feared in the financial services industry have not materialized, reducing the chances that a lot of office space will be dumped back on the market.
Meanwhile, new industries, most of them computer-related, are growing in Manhattan and injecting new life into what had been declining postindustrial neighborhoods, such as the garment manufacturing buildings in the teens between Fifth and Sixth Avenues and the old printing buildings near Hudson Square on the west side.
The companies in these new industries are contributing to the numbers and pace at which new leases are being signed. "Leasing velocity over the last two years has been 25 to 30 percent better that the best years in the past," said Stephen B. Siegel, the president of Insignia/ESG.
Mr. Siegel said he expected the pace to decline somewhat in 1999, but added that some large space users, including the NASDAQ stock trading operation and the German-based publishing company Bertelsmann, are actively looking for new quarters.
Liquidity will return to the market, real estate executives say, as Wall Street firms sell their portfolios of existing loans and start looking for new business. "People talked about a capital crisis, but it was really a pricing crisis," said John D. Lyons, chief executive of Granite Partners, a real estate financing firm. "People were not lending because they did not know what price to lend at."
He said that one result of the crunch is that money is more expensive for acquirers and developers than it was. He said that interest rates are 2 to 2.5 percent above Treasury securities with a similar maturity, compared to 0.8 to 1.0 percent above during the summer. But he said that was still more favorable than the 3 to 3.5 percent premiums that prevailed three years ago as the market was developing.
At the height of the crunch in October, he said, lenders were demanding rates of up to 7.50 percent, regardless of how low the rates on Treasury securities fell.
Higher interest rates and the need for buyers to put up more equity capital means that the prices paid for property are expected to be somewhat lower than in the first half of 1998.
"The return on equity is higher than debt," said Barry Gosin, the chief executive of Newmark & Company Real Estate, explaining that stockholders want more income for their greater risk than the relatively more secure bondholders.
Mr. Gosin said if a purchaser has to put up 30 to 40 percent equity -- rather than the 5 or 10 percent that was sufficient when money was flowing out of Wall Street -- it limits the ability to bid. "You have to pay less for properties," he said. "It's that simple."
Mr. Gosin said that prices appeared to be down 10 to 20 percent, although not many transactions have closed since the bond market crunch began in the fall.
Some real estate executives say the markets have functioned as they are supposed to, cutting off funding before too many people joined the party. "The capital markets exerted discipline and prevented overbuilding," said Mitchell Hersh, the president of Mack-Cali Realty, a New Jersey-based REIT. "It is usually supply that puts markets out of balance."
The furious pace of the first half of 1998 many have contributed to the slowdown in the later months, said Thomas L. Benneville, managing director of LaSalle Partners' investment banking group.
"A lot of guys in my business had the year in the bag by July," he said. "So when the markets got hit, they had no reason to move quickly."
But he predicted that sales activity would pick up quickly this year. "The real estate fundamentals are still good," he said, "and you have to eat in '99, too."
Others agreed. Darcy Stacom, an investment sales specialist at the Cushman & Wakefield brokerage company, said that the Wall Street firms started getting back in the market late last year and that she expected sales to be brisk early in the year. "We are going to see a lot of product for sale in the first quarter," she said.
One sale that closed late in the year was that of Exchange Place Center, a 700,000-square-foot waterfront office tower in Jersey City, for $175 million. The building was purchased by BBV U.S. Real Estate Fund III, a German investment group, from Prudential Real Estate Investors.
In the leasing market, brokers say they expect the landlords in New York to continue to have the upper hand, but few are predicting sharp increases in rent.
"There have been better times to be a tenant," said James Meiskin, the president of Plymouth Partners, a tenant's representative. "Rents will go up marginally, but you will see less free rent, less work and tougher lease terms," he said, referring to provisions that give tenants a period of no rent and require landlords to contribute to renovation costs.
But some brokers say the summer's dips in the stock market have cooled the demand for space. "During the summer there was an intense frenzy for every piece of space," said Mitchell Steir, an executive vice president of the Julien J. Studley brokerage company. "That has leveled off. Now the landlords do not have two backup deals for every bit of space."
Although the decline in the price of REIT shares sharply slowed their pace of acquisition, it did not prevent Reckson Associates Realty Corporation from becoming the second of the suburban-based REIT's to enter the Manhattan office market. The first was Vornado Realty Trust, which acquired the Mendik Company's midtown portfolio in early 1997.
Reckson reached agreement to acquire Tower Realty, a Manhattan-based REIT with seven buildings totaling 2.3 million square feet, including Tower 45 at 120 West 45th Street.
The original plan was for Reckson to be an equal partner with Crescent Real Estate in an acquisition vehicle called Metropolitan Partners. But when Crescent pulled back, Reckson went ahead with the acquisition for a total of $680 million in cash, stock and assumption of debt, with Crescent remaining as a passive investor.
Scott Rechler, the president of Reckson, described the acquisition as a strategic one for the company, which already has properties on Long Island, in New Jersey and in the area north of New York City.
A report by CIBC Oppenheimer, a securities brokerage and research firm, on the deal said that "With Reckson having established a dominant position as an owner/operator of office and industrial real estate in the suburban New York market, the Tower acquisition appears to be a natural extension to fill a geographic void in its portfolio." But it warned that Reckson needed to find managers for the Tower properties who are both savvy about the Manhattan market and able to participate smoothly in a suburban-oriented company.
The following is a look at markets in the metropolitan area:
 
Midtown
Prime Office Space
Is Scarce
Space in modern buildings in good locations is all but unavailable, real estate executives report. "In the top 65 buildings north of 42d Street, the vacancy rate is about 2 percent, which is something that we have not seen since 1980," said Steven A. Swerdlow, senior managing director of CB Richard Ellis's metropolitan area office.
With prime space scarce, some tenants are even leasing space they do not currently need in anticipation of even higher rents and stiffer terms in the future. "We are seeing a mentality of taking an extra 10,000 square feet of space and warehousing it," said Robert Emden, an executive managing director of Grubb & Ellis, a brokerage company. "Tenants are concerned about protecting themselves down the road."
Unlike the last office market peak in the 1980's, there is very little building going on in Manhattan, and the few projects under way or announced are largely preleased. The Reuters news and financial information company will occupy most of the 856,000-square-foot building, designated 3 Times Square, being constructed at the northwest corner of Seventh Avenue and 42d Street.
The largely complete 1.6 million-square-foot building at Broadway and 42d Street, designated 4 Times Square by its developer, the Durst Organization, will be divided between the Conde Nast publishing company and the Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom law firm.
The financial services company Bear Stearns will be the principal tenant of a 1.1 million-square-foot building under way on Madison Avenue between 46th and 47th Streets.
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter will be the principal tenant and co-developer of a million-square-foot building to be built on what is now a parking lot on Seventh Avenue between 49th and 50th Streets. The co-developer is the Rockefeller Group, the former proprietor of the landmarked Rockefeller Center and still the part owner and manager of four buildings along the west side of the Avenue of the Americas facing the center.
 
Downtown
High-Tech Firms
Keep on Arriving
Because the midtown market has reached saturation, "the overflow tenants will have to flow downtown," said Mr. Cohen of Williams Real Estate. "Because that is where the double-digit vacancies remain."
During the year, Guardian Life Insurance Company of America said it would move from the Union Square area to 7 Hanover Square near the lower tip of Manhattan, while Empire Blue Cross & Blue Shield decided to leave midtown for 461,000 square feet at One World Trade Center.
"The most important thing for downtown was that there was no disaster in financial services," said Mr. Siegel of Insignia/ESG. He said that the developing infrastructure of what was once canyons of office buildings -- new stores, hotels and other amenities -- was making the area attractive for people who like to live near where they work.
In addition, the city-subsidized Plug 'n' Go program and other incentives have attracted computer-based companies to downtown buildings that have been rewired and outfitted for tenants who need robust telecommunications, power and cooling services.
"All this activity has accelerated the relocation of numerous small high-technology companies from places like Vancouver, Cambridge, Mass., and New Hampshire to downtown," said a report by CB Richard Ellis.
 
The Suburbs
The Action Is
In New Jersey
New Jersey is where the commercial development action is, both along the west bank of the Hudson and in the middle of the state in Morris and Somerset Counties. Private developers are leading the way, with REIT's -- even those with development sites -- holding back because of uncertainty about how financial analysts will value projects that have no current income.
"Wall Street does not know how to handle development projects, so the REIT's will not build on speculation," said Donald P. Eisen, executive managing director for the suburban market at Cushman & Wakefield. Mr. Eisen said that between 2 million and 3 million square feet of office space was under construction in the state, which he said was not a major addition to a 140 million-square-foot market.
SJP Properties is building three speculative office projects in Morris, Somerset and Mercer Counties totaling 900,000 square feet and has an agreement with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to build a 1.2 million-square-foot office building on the waterfront in Hoboken.
Although he will not start the Hoboken project without an anchor tenant, Steven J. Pozycki, the company's president, said his relationship with pension funds insulated him from the ups and downs of capital markets.
"The funds followed us in the early 1990's when we were doing acquisitions and since 1994 when we resumed development," he said. "Our investors know we will take reasonable risks."
Mr. Pozycki said that with Class A office buildings replacing abandoned industrial plants on the Hudson, the west bank of the river should be regarded as part of the Manhattan market. But it is a place that is cheaper and where it is possible to erect buildings with large floors suitable for trading floors.
Emanuel Stern of Hartz Mountain Industries is developing projects as varied as an office building at 90 Hudson Street in Jersey City, the TriBeCa Grand Hotel at Sixth Avenue and White Streets in Manhattan and an 1,100-car parking deck in Newark.
He said the problems in the credit markets actually helped established developers like himself, who can finance their own projects if necessary. "It's the new guys who get hurt," he said.
Speculative building is also under way on Long Island, where Greenway Plaza Office Park, a Melville developer, started a 100,000-square-foot office building on Pinelawn Road in Melville in July. Fortunato Development of Bohemia followed in October with a 60,000-square-foot building at Airport Corporate Center in Bohemia. And in December, the Tilles Companies began a 100,000-square-foot building at Gateway Office Park in Woodbury.
In Westchester, a rising vacancy rate, caused by the relocation of large companies such as I.B.M. and Nynex, is squelching any plans to build. The country's overall vacancy rate stood at 18 percent in 1998, compared to 16.5 percent the year earlier. In the business hub of the county, White Plains, vacancies were 30 percent, up from 28.3 percent in the previous year.
The little building that is under way in Connecticut is not taking place in the traditional office center of Stamford, but in places like Shelton, Norwalk and suburban New Haven. One of the most ambitious projects is under way in Bridgeport, where the city is embarked on a $1 billion, 3-million-square-foot waterfront commercial and retail development.
 
Retail
Low Vacancy Rates
And Higher Prices
A low vacancy rate -- under 5 percent, according to some reports -- and strong demand for prime locations has driven up rental rates for retail space in Manhattan, with parts of Madison Avenue among the most expensive in the world.
"A store with 4,000 square feet on the ground on Madison Avenue commands in excess of $500 a square foot," said Faith H. Consolo, a senior managing director of Garrick-Aug Associates, retail real estate specialists. "A year ago those deals were $250 to $250 a square foot."
Ms. Consolo said that the strong economy and the appeal of New York were behind the demand. "New York is where retailers want to be," she said. And the appeal is not just glamour. Sales at a Manhattan store can be as much as those of five or six suburban mall stores combined.
"There is competition for every location that comes on the market," said Alan Victor, an executive vice president of the Lansco Corporation, a retail brokerage company. He said the demand came from stores already in Manhattan, such as the Gap, Old Navy and Coach, which added locations, and from newcomers such as Restoration Hardware, which are opening their first stores.
In addition to high-fashion stores that cluster on Madison and Fifth Avenues and are slipping into areas like SoHo and the Flatiron District, chains that deal in more mundane items and have been successful across the country are looking to New York for expansion, brokers report. They say that Wal-Mart and Target are particularly interested in breaking into this market.
 
Hotels
Room Rates and
Occupancy Rise
The city's hotels continue to be essentially full, with profits rising as operators raise room rates and developers scour the city for sites to build new hotels or convert existing buildings for use as hotels.
According to a report by E&Y Kenneth Leventhal Real Estate Group, occupancy last year was 83.0 percent compared to 81.5 percent in 1987. The average room rate in the city reached an all-time high of $192 a night, which was a 9.5 percent increase over the previous year.
Revenue per available rooms, a key indicator of financial performance, also reached an all-time high of $159, according to the report, which was a 11.5 percent increase over 1997.
The financial performance of hotels in New York far outstrips the rest of the nation, said Sean Hennessey, head of the new York hospitality practice of PricewaterhouseCoopers, an accounting and consulting company.
Mr. Hennessey said that in 1991 annual income per room after expenses in New York was $9,179, compared to $4,977 for the rest of the country. In 1997, the figure for New York was $32,008 compared to $10,100 elsewhere. "New York is three times more profitable than the average for the United States," Mr. Hennessey said.
As a result, there are 16 hotels with a total of 3,256 rooms under construction, renovation or considered likely to go forward, according to a PricewaterhouseCoopers survey. Nine more hotels, with 3,540 rooms, are in the planning process, and 17 more, with as many as 6,480 rooms, are in the proposal stage.
But rapidly rising room rates may be too much of a good thing, Mr. Leventhal said. "With the average daily rate for Manhattan approaching $200 a night," he said, "Manhattan could be pricing itself out of some market segments such as wholesale and leisure travel as well as lower-rated corporate travel."

Fewer Firefighters But Lots of Chiefs

BYLINE: By STEVE STRUNSKY 

DATELINE: WEST NEW YORK

 BODY:
At an appearance here last month to talk about the regional fire department formed by five communities in Hudson County, Governor Whitman praised the effort to overcome the state's history of home rule. The merger, the Governor told the crowd, would result in a property tax savings by stripping away overlapping layers of bureaucracy strewn across municipal borders.
But relinquishing turf as closely guarded as firefighting zones is difficult. When the newly formed North Hudson Regional Fire and Rescue -- made up of departments from Union City, North Bergen, West New York, Weehawken and Guttenberg -- swore in its leaders last Monday, it had an unusual and somewhat unexpected command structure: two chiefs and two executive directors. 
 "So much for economy," said David I. Fox, a lawyer who represented Union City firefighters in an unsuccessful suit to put the merger to a vote.
Although proponents of the merger defended the layers of leadership, critics said it flew in the face of the effort to reduce the bureaucracy. "It's going back to square one: more chiefs, fewer Indians," said Mayor Peter LaVilla of Guttenberg.
At the department's swearing-in on Jan. 4, Anthony J. Presutti was appointed chief of administration; he will be paid the same $125,000 a year that he had received as chief of the West New York Fire Department. His co-chief of operations, Robert A. Jones, who had been the chief in Union City, will continue to receive $130,000 a year. Jeffrey C. Welz of Weehawken, sworn in as executive director of operations, and Michael J. DeOrio of North Bergen, the executive director of administration, will both earn $42,500 a year.
Robert Aiello of West New York, chairman of the department's governing board, said that having two chiefs and two executive directors was a temporary measure to insure a smooth transition. "My gut reaction is, that will narrow down in the next couple years," Mr. Aiello said, adding that the chiefs are in their 60's and nearing retirement.
Just how much money the regional department will save is uncertain, Mr. Aiello said. For one thing, no budget has been agreed on, though officials expect savings by cutting some of the 350 positions through attrition. In addition, the departments had different pay scales; officials acknowledged that salaries were likely to go up for lower-paid firefighters rather than have higher-paid people take cuts.
There are also startup costs, which Governor Whitman said last month would approach $2 million, including the buyout plan, legal and consulting fees and new equipment. But, she added, the state could pay those costs under pending legislation.
A spokeswoman for Ms. Whitman, Wendi Patella, said the department's multiple management team does not represent a bureaucratic backslide, and the Governor still expects "significant" savings from the merger.

HEADLINE: ROAD AND RAIL;
One Track, Two Loads

BYLINE: By ANDREA KANNAPELL 

 BODY:
Like the goose that suddenly started laying golden eggs, New Jersey's rail system has turned from an unwelcome burden to an invaluable treasure, a vital artery for commuters as well as goods. While that may be welcome news for the region's economy, it may not be for the commuters whose trains will face growing competition for track space on crowded freight lines.
As demand for passenger service has surged statewide, with little new track being laid, a reorganization of the region's freight rail system is scheduled to take effect March 1, splitting the old Conrail monopoly between two national shippers, CSX and Norfolk Southern. The shift will return competition to the area for the first time in more than two decades. 
 The effect over the next few years, most industry experts believe, will be dramatic increases in freight business as the new competition forces prices down and service quality up. A tug-of-war between passengers and freight is an almost certain outcome, the experts say.
"It's very difficult to operate freight and passenger service on the same tracks," said Craig Lewis, a vice president at Norfolk Southern. "With the speed of passenger trains, it's almost like a Pac-Man scenario." Passenger trains are so much faster that the space between trains needs to be much greater.
The struggles are likely to be intense. Irritated commuters can always complain to their elected officials; after all, the New Jersey Department of Transportation and New Jersey Transit are state agencies. But as in most of the country, the majority of existing tracks are owned by private freight lines and passenger trains pay for the right to run on them.
On March 1, 445 of the 1,000 route miles (multiple tracks can be laid along a single route) Conrail owns in New Jersey will fall under the jurisdiction of what is called "new Conrail," a jointly owned subsidiary of Norfolk Southern and CSX, and the remainder will become the property of one or the other parent company, as part of a deal worth more than $10 billion. Each parent will get one major northern and southern route into New Jersey: Norfolk Southern will take over the route from Bound Brook to Allentown and from North Bergen to Suffern, while CSX will take the route from North Bergen toward Albany (the West Shore Line) and from Bound Brook to Trenton.
New Jersey Transit currently operates on a total of about 850 miles of track, of which it owns 500 miles. CSX and Norfolk Southern will own about 100 miles and Amtrak owns about 240.
All the players have anticipated friction, and have tried to foresee ways of minimizing it. Since New Jersey Transit owns at least some of the track the freights will run on, it will have leverage in disputes. And there are already carefully negotiated guidelines that aim to protect passenger service without unduly hobbling the freights. For instance, the D.O.T. and New Jersey Transit say there will be no curtailment of current passenger service, so conflict will be reserved for the expansion of commuter services New Jersey Transit has planned, particularly in northern New Jersey.
For instance, CSX expects its freight business to need all the capacity on the West Shore line. But New Jersey Transit has plans to expand service in that area, and the agency bought some right of way along the route in 1978.
The conflict has its roots in the early 70's, when half a dozen freight companies went bankrupt. The Federal Government stepped in, creating Conrail in 1976. For 11 years it operated the company, selling off any "extra" land and rights, a downsizing that railroad watchers now groan over, since it would be prohibitively expensive, if not physically impossible, to reclaim those resources.
"Once you have people building pools in the old right-of-way, it becomes pretty hard to get it back," said Douglas Bowen, president of an advocacy group called the New Jersey Association of Railroad Passengers.
In 1987 the Government sold Conrail to the private sector, so when CSX and Norfolk Southern signed an agreement last year to pay more than $10 billion for it, they were making an ordinary business deal, in which the first priority is turning a profit.
Norfolk Southern has a reputation for accommodating passenger service, according to Mr. Bowen. On the other hand, he said, CSX "has a reputation for being notoriously anti-passenger rail."
"I don't want to say it doesn't play fair, because it's their railroad, they can do what they want," Mr. Bowen added. But some would call their approach downright hostile."
CSX presents itself as an asset to an area that needs to make some difficult choices for its own economic vitality. For the moment, the state D.O.T. agrees. Increasing the amount of freight that moves by rail gets truck traffic off roadways and allows the region's economic strength to grow. Local imports and exports should increase, as should traffic to and from Ports Newark and Elizabeth, both say.
"The region has grown its industrial base," said Mike Brimmer, a regional vice president for CSX. "And you still have major facilities that depend on rail, like the chemical companies, the Ford plant in Metuchen, the G.M. assembly plant in Linden. And the same population that increases the demand for passenger service also increases the demands for orange juice and televisions."
Not all the passenger rail companies expect trouble. Amtrak, for instance, is positively sanguine. Rick Remington, a spokesman, said that freight on Amtrak's Northeast Corridor generally operates only between 10 P.M. and 6 A.M. and that Norfolk and CSX were already running about six more trains during those hours without creating problems.
And if a train loaded with freight could make its delivery schedule only by running during prime passenger hours?
"It's our call," Mr. Remington said. "It's our railroad."

Smoke Signals

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
Smokers in New Jersey took such a shellacking at the cash register last year that they stopped buying cigarettes in numbers never seen before. How many stopped smoking is a separate question.
Since the state cigarette tax doubled last Jan. 1, sales have declined about 12 percent, Treasury Department data show. While some sales have been chased across state borders, public health experts estimate that at least two-thirds of the decline reflects a decrease in smoking. 
 "Wow, that's a whole lot more than we predicted," said Larry Downs, director of New Jersey Breathes, a coalition of anti-smoking organizations. Before the increase, Mr. Downs said, consumption had been dropping by 2 to 4 percent a year. "Something's going on," he continued. "I'll give you 4 percent for people buying cigarettes elsewhere and I'll take the 8 percent drop."
Mr. Downs said the tax increase had set up "a real-life public health experiment": While New Jersey's tax rose to 80 cents a pack from 40 cents, neighboring states maintained their rates -- Pennsylvania at 31 cents a pack, New York at 56 cents and Delaware at 24 cents. Len Fishman, the state Commissioner of Health and Senior Services, said the initial wallop was meant to drive down sales, even though most of the new revenue finances health care.
"We were hoping a dramatic increase would decrease consumption," Mr. Fishman said. "We did predict that there would be a reduction in the number of people who smoke." He said that in his travels around the state, "a lot of people have told me that they quit, and a lot told me that this was the straw that broke the camel's back."
The tax increase placed New Jersey behind only Alaska and Hawaii, at $1 a pack, and Washington State, at 82.5 cents. (On Jan. 1, California's tax rose to 87 cents a pack.) The sticker shock was compounded last month by a price increase, 45 cents a pack at wholesale and about 60 cents at the counter, from tobacco manufacturers.
The two hits raised prices by about 50 percent. At Wawa convenience stores, for example, premium brands cost $3.32 a pack, up from $2.22 before the tax increase.
Revenue from tax stamps from Jan. 1 through June 30, the end of the 1998 fiscal year, were about 13 percent below what they would have been had sales remained at their 1997 levels; when the effect of volume discounts was taken into account, the decline in cigarette sales was about 12 percent, Treasury Department officials said.
Preliminary figures for the current fiscal year show similar decreases. When the tax took effect, cigarette revenue was already falling; in the fiscal year 1997, revenue dropped 2 percent. Had that dropoff continued, 1998 revenue through November would have been about $433.3 million, or 54.2 million cartons. Instead, revenue was about $379.4 million, or 47.4 million cartons. The gap, then, represents about 6.8 million cartons, and there is no way to know how many were bought in other states.
In New York, cigarette tax revenue from January to November 1998 was 0.3 percent below collections fore the same period in 1997 Pennsylvania reported a 1.4 percent increase in 1998. In Delaware, where revenue was already increasing at a rate of 3 percent a year, the first half of 1998 saw a 10 percent increase over the first half of 1997. Pennsylvania's additional revenue through November represents about 1.2 million more cartons than were sold from January to November 1997, but sales were declining -- by 1.8 percent in the 1997 fiscal year -- and if that decline had continued, the extra tax collections would represent about 2.9 million more cartons.
Delaware's extra sales through November, assuming a continued 3 percent increase, exceeded 500,000 cartons. While researchers have consistently found dropoffs in smoking after price increases, they cannot know exactly what role prices have played. There have been few large, one-time price increases, and no precedent for a tax increase as large as New Jersey's.
Mr. Fishman cites the example of Massachusetts, which raised its tax 25 cents a pack in 1992 and registered a 12.5 percent decline in sales the next year.
"Talking about price increases can be tricky," Mr. Fishman said. "If you have gradual increases, you lose some of the impact. A state with a high tax may have had less of an increase over the years."
It is especially hard to measure the effects of cigarette prices on underage buyers. Many studies have concluded that price has a greater effect on children and teen-agers than on adults. But a recent analysis by economists at Cornell University, using data on students who were eighth graders in 1988, found that price increases had very little effect on whether they took up smoking.
And while the smoking rate among adults has been inching down -- to 23.2 percent of adults nationwide and 21.5 percent in New Jersey, according to the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- it has sharply risen among teen-agers and children. In its most recent published survey of high school seniors, taken in 1997, the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research found that 24.6 percent were daily smokers, a figure that has steadily climbed from a low point of 18.1 percent in 1988.
In New Jersey, the centers' 1997 survey of 9th to 12th graders found that 38 percent had smoked a cigarette in the previous month and 19 percent were daily smokers.
Mr. Fishman said his department had predicted a decline of 10 to 12 percent in smoking among children and teen-agers as a result of the tax increase and that its effects would become clearer this spring, when the state surveys middle-school students.
It will be longer yet before the manufacturers' price increase, which took effect only in late November, shows measurable results. But Rich Herbeck, co-owner of Irwin Tobacco and Candy, a distributor in Trenton, said that even though the increase was nationwide, it was sending New Jerseyans across the bridges just as the tax hit had done last January.
"People were so shocked by it that they're looking for any method to save money," Mr. Herbeck said.

HEADLINE: ON THE TOWNS: THE ARTS;
Healing the Wounds of Racism Through Expression

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
A CONNECTION between Newark and next month's PBS broadcast of "I'll Make Me a World," an examination of black contributions to American culture, may have been a marriage made in heaven.
The scheduled broadcast of the six-hour series comes at a time when the city is still awash in the enthusiasm generated by the success of the year-old New Jersey Performing Arts Center and the hopes it has fueled for a broader revitalization of the city. It also coincides with a movement within the city to get in closer touch with Newark's rich artistic roots, and to view the city anew despite its image as a troubled urban area. 
 "It is a depressed area, but we all know that as far as the culture and art is concerned, it is not depressed, but very rich," said Faith Ringgold, a visual artist in nearby Englewood. "It is important that Newark know that they may not have much money, but they have great art and artists."
Getting that message out is the goal of the Newark Coalition for "I'll Make Me a World," consisting of local arts groups, colleges, foundations and artists who have arranged nearly two months of events promoting the show and Newark's artistic heritage. The coalition includes the Newark Museum, the New Jersey Historical Society, Seton Hall University, the New Community Corporation, Aljira: A Center for Contemporary Art and WBGO-FM.
The events, which begin today and run through February, range from art exhibitions and jazz concerts to lectures, films and radio programs. The events will highlight not only the contributions of artists like Ms. Ringgold, Amiri Baraka, Sarah Vaughan and Paul Robeson, who are prominently featured in the series, but also the work of local artists who are not, like the Montclair jazz musician and composer Steve Colson, and the photographers Bill May and Mansa Mussa and the painter Bisa Washington, all of Newark.
Newark is one of 11 communities nationwide that have received grants from national and local foundations to develop programs highlighting and promoting the series, produced by the award-winning documentarian Henry Hampton and his production company, Blackside Inc., in association with WNET, Channel 13. Mr. Hampton, who died in November, was the executive producer of the "Eyes on the Prize," documenting the civil rights movement; "America's War on Poverty"; "The Great Depression" and "Malcolm X: Make it Plain."
Robert Lovell, director of publishing, education and new media for Boston-based Blackside, said such local efforts were part of the the company's attempt to draw attention to its work amid the cacophony of offerings available on 65 cable television outlets, the Internet and other competing media. It was also a way of promoting partnerships between large cultural institutions with smaller, local African-American arts groups, as well as extending the educational uses to which the programming can be put -- both of which, he said, nicely dovetailed with the educational and cultural missions of foundations around the country.
In addition to foundation money assembled by Blackside, the Newark coalition received support for its programs from the New Jersey Council for the Humanities and the Morristown-based Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation.
Two visits to Newark by Mr. Hampton over the last two years suggested the possibility of some synergy between the broadcasts and local concerns, coalition members said. Alexandra Christie, a program officer with the Dodge Foundation, recalled a program at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in October 1997 at which the foundation, which gave financial support to the documentary, was honoring Mr. Hampton.
"His being here inspired people to think about things locally," Ms. Christie recalled. "The first thing he said to us from the stage was that he wanted to talk about memory and how you can't understand where you are going unless you understand where you have been. He saw things that no one else saw, and suddenly what he was doing and what so many of us wanted for Newark seemed a perfect match."
Last year, Mr. Hampton returned to Newark to be honored by Aljira, a small art gallery and performance space, said Jane Stein, program coordinator at the Newark Museum. He met more people among the city's arts community and made more converts to the idea of promoting the documentary along with Newark's arts community and artists.
Sam Pollard, a co-executive producer of "I'll Make Me a World," who with Ms. Ringgold will be part of today's start of the local coalition's promotional programs, said he hoped the series would draw attention to the arts' importance to any society. He recalled that the actor Ossie Davis, one of several artists featured and interviewed in the series, said art -- whether it was music, painting, literature, dance or other performances -- was a way for black people to find out who they were as they struggled to overcome racism and the other consequences of their history as slaves.
"He saw the arts as being like a breath of fresh air," said Mr. Pollard, interpreting Mr. Davis. "So we are not only trying to highlight heroes of the past but encourage people to take a look at the people in their community who are contributing artistically today."

HEADLINE: Looking for the Right Words at the Detroit Show

BYLINE: By JAMES G. COBB 

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
ONE problem with auto makers' headlong rush to cross-breed sedans, wagons, trucks, vans and four-by-fours is coming up with ways to categorize the new, hybrid forms they are creating.
More than a dozen such crossover vehicles made their debuts here last week at the North American International Auto Show, either as products soon to be sold, as prototypes of future offerings or as design studies that may -- or may not -- find their way into showrooms in some modified form. But even those scrambling to meet what they perceive as new, unfilled needs in private transportation seem daunted by the semantics of their creations. 
 Robert J. Eaton, chairman of DaimlerChrysler, called the Chrysler PT Cruiser -- a high-roofed small sedan with minivan-style cargo flexibility and a profile out of the 1930's -- a "segment-breaker too cool to categorize." The car will go on sale in about a year, starting below $20,000.
Nissan called the design of its S.U.T. "a collision of a truck and a sport utility vehicle" and its new Xterra sport utility "a tough, mobile place for stuff."
Toyota described its latest small car, the Echo, as having "low floor height with a high seating position."
J. Mays, Ford's vice president for design, called the (My) Mercury a concept vehicle "that blurs the boundaries between a car, a truck and a sport-utility vehicle." And when unveiling the Explorer Sport Trac, a twist on Ford's popular sport utility with a pickup bed replacing the covered cargo compartment, spokesmen were reduced to calling it "not a car-truck, but a truck-truck."
While these combinations got much of the attention here, the auto companies have not altogether abandoned the market for car-cars. Chevrolet showed its 2000 Impala, dusting off one of America's best-known automotive names for its new flagship, which will replace the Lumina when it goes on sale next summer. Likewise, Buick showed its redesigned 2000 LeSabre, which is to reach the market even sooner, and Lexus announced that it would import in mid-2000 its IS sport sedan, a competitor to the BMW 3-Series and Audi A4.
Mercedes-Benz showed its all-new S-Class, a trimmed version of the biggest sedan it makes, while a smaller new Jaguar, the S-Type, made its American debut.
New small cars included Toyota's Echo, aimed at the 20-somethings Toyota calls the "Net generation," with upgraded stereos and special CD compartments; DaimlerChrysler's all-new 2000 models of its Dodge and Plymouth Neon, and Ford's Focus, which replaces the Escort.
Among the few announcements of environmental interest, Honda said it plans to sell its V V gasoline-electric hybrid, which has very low emissions and is said to go 70 miles on a gallon of gas, in the United States. And Ford displayed a working version of a car that runs on advanced fuel cells that convert hydrogen to energy with no emissions, though executives acknowledged that a production version would not come until 2004 at the earliest.
Although nothing on display at Cobo Center generated the buzz accorded last year to the Volkswagen New Beetle, the car that came closest to being the show-stopper was a Ford Thunderbird that captures the flavor of the original T-Birds of 1955-57. The two-seat roadster has a removable roof, prominent round taillights, porthole side windows, hooded gauges and a pastel palette. It is likely to be sold as a 2001 model.
Another name from the mid-50's, the Chevrolet Nomad, was revived as a sporty retro-style wagon, also resembling a sport utility.
Two European sports cars were also crowd pleasers. The Audi TT, a post-industrial design with a striking Bauhaus-style interior, made its American debut; it goes on sale in late spring. And Mercedes showed its Vision SLR, a design study for a high-style, super-high-performance sports car that draws on the Formula One look.
Another design study, from Nissan, capitalized on the nostalgia for that company's Datsun 240Z sports car of the early 70's. The updated Z has a similar long-hooded look and was planned to sell for less than $25,000 -- an amount that Nissan said was equivalent, after adjusting for inflation, to the price of the original.
Two of the few companies without sport utilities joined the fray. Hyundai showed a prototype, the Santa Fe, that would compete with vehicles like the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4. And BMW rolled out its first all-wheel-drive vehicle, the X5, which it insists is a "sport activity vehicle" not intended for off-road use -- a strategy intended to prevent the cannibalization of sales from its Land Rover unit. It will be built in South Carolina and reach market late this year.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS REPORT;
These Pilots See a Bumpy Flight

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
ALTHOUGH most mutual fund investors closed out 1998 with gains, the road was rocky, with their climb hampered by sharp dips and the summer selloff.
The five professional money managers who have built hypothetical retirement portfolios over the last five years for The New York Times expect volatility to increase in 1999. 
 "I'm expecting a very rugged year," said Jack A. Brill, a San Diego adviser who hews a "socially responsible" course. "My guess is that the market will break 10,000, with a 15 percent meltdown during the year," he said. "I'd expect 10 to 15 percent growth at best."
Mr. Brill tied for first place among the five advisers in the fourth quarter. His portfolio rose 20.34 percent, lifted by its bias toward large- and mid-capitalization stocks. It was handicapped only by an investment in Vanguard GNMA, which rose less than 1 percent.
He is whittling some holdings to make room for the Citizens Index fund, but is otherwise sitting tight. He figures -- as do the other four advisers -- that a diverse portfolio is the best weapon against market volatility. That, and a stiff upper lip. "I think individual investors should play the market for the long term, looking past the daily hype and focusing on solid growth," he said.
WHAT, of course, is not always easy to do. Susan Dziubinski, editor of Morningstar Fund Investor, a newsletter, noted wryly that while diversification remained her touchstone, it did not pay off in 1998. "This certainly wasn't a good year for a contrarian portfolio like mine," she said. "Small value continued to lag, and so did emerging markets. And nearly nonexistent inflation hammered Oppenheimer Real Asset, my portfolio hedge."
Ms. Dziubinski came in right behind the two leaders for the quarter, with a gain of 17.01 percent, and has tinkered only a bit with her portfolio.
Among the minor adjustments, she is condensing her large-cap international funds by scuttling Ivy International in favor of EuroPacific Growth, which has lower expenses. Similarly, she is jettisoning Small Cap World, a global fund with a large chunk of small domestic stocks, and buying Founders Passport, a small-cap fund with less than 3 percent of assets invested in the United States.
She is also selling the Fidelity Fund, which she concedes is a top performer, and buying TIAA-CREF Growth and Income. About 80 percent of the TIAA-CREF fund tracks the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. "Over the long term," she added, "I question the ability of active managers to really add value when it comes to large-cap investing."
Sheldon Jacobs, who edits the No-load Fund Investor in Irvington, N.Y., was tied with Mr. Brill for first place in the quarter and retains the lead among the five managers over all, with a cumulative gain of 129.69 percent since July 7, 1993, when the contest began. In that time, the five portfolios have risen an average of 107.09 percent, compared with a 212.16 percent return for the Vanguard 500 Index fund, which mimics the S.& P. 500.
THE performance of the hypothetical portfolios is tracked each quarter by Lipper Inc. of Summit, N.J. It excludes sales charges, transaction costs and taxes because most retirement money is held in tax-deferred accounts. The five managers can choose any fund open to new investors and can shift money quarterly. They were asked to pick portfolios intended to grow for 20 years.
All the portfolios earned double-digit returns in the quarter -- a period in which Morningstar Inc., the financial publisher, calculates that diversified domestic equity funds rose an average of 18.78 percent.
Mr. Jacobs is adding to his holdings in Vanguard 500 Index, formerly called Vanguard Index Trust 500, bringing it to 15 percent of assets from 12.5 percent. This change, plus the 35 percent weighting in Vanguard Total Stock Market, enables him to reach his goal of being 50 percent invested in index funds. The extra money for the Index 500 fund comes from selling a small chunk of Baron Growth and Income, lowering it to 10 percent of the portfolio.
He is also replacing American Century/20th Century International Discovery, a small-cap fund, with Montgomery International Growth, a large-cap blend fund, because he thinks big stocks will outperform smaller ones overseas.
Eric M. Kobren, president of Kobren Insight Group and editor of Fidelity Insight in Wellesley, Mass., finished next to last in the quarter, with a gain of 15.68 percent. His portfolio, made up entirely of Fidelity funds, was held back by a 20 percent investment in Fidelity Spartan Government Income, which slipped 0.23 percent. Even so, he is increasing his position in the fund to 25 percent from 20 percent. He is adding to the bond holdings, he said, "because strong corporate earnings growth will remain hard to achieve in 1999."
Mr. Kobren is doubling his position, to 20 percent, in Fidelity Contrafund II, which he calls "a fund with the flexibility to go anywhere in the market in search of good stocks." He is reducing his position in Fidelity Small-Cap Stock to 15 percent from 20 percent. And he sold his entire 10 percent holding in Fidelity Real Estate, because, he said, the bond fund provides sufficient diversification.
Harold R. Evensky, a financial adviser in Coral Gables, Fla., finished last in the quarter, with a portfolio gain of 14.44 percent.
In a departure from his usual practice of making few changes, Mr. Evensky is giving his portfolio a new look this quarter. He is selling his position in Cohen & Steers Realty Shares and using that money to start an 8 percent position in Vanguard Extended Market Index, to give added exposure to smaller stocks. He is replacing Warburg Pincus International Equity, which gained 12.88 percent in the last quarter, with Montgomery International Growth. He is also exchanging Blackrock Small Cap Growth for Undiscovered Managers Behavioral Growth.
"It remains tough," he said, "to preach intelligent diversification in long-term investing in an environment like this."

4 Who Found a 4th-Quarter Feast

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
REBOUNDING from the nasty summer selloff, managers of United States diversified stock funds breathed a sigh of relief in the fourth quarter. On average, their funds returned a gratifying 18.8 percent. The strong close pulled their average returns up to 15.1 percent for 1998, though that was still far behind the 24 percent of 1997.
But the top-performing equity managers whistled an even happier tune, with quarterly returns of up to 70 percent. 
 Here, four winners for the quarter look back at what made them such standouts -- and offer a glance ahead.
 
Earnings Up, Rates Down
"We got a double whammy this year," said Douglas S. Foreman, who manages the $256.6 million Morgan Stanley Dean Witter TCW Mid-Cap Equity Trust from Los Angeles. The fund returned 49.2 percent in the fourth quarter, landing in third place among United States diversified stock funds.
"We had companies that met or beat earnings expectations when many companies were falling short, so the value of our predictable growth went up measurably during the year," Mr. Foreman said. "Also, falling interest rates boost stock prices for companies which are exceeding earnings expectations, because the earnings are worth more as investment alternatives become less attractive."
Yahoo, at 6.1 percent of assets, was his biggest hit for the quarter and for the year, up 584.3 percent in 1998. "We think the company is unbelievably well positioned to capitalize on the Internet, which is a paradigm shift in technology and in the way people communicate," he said. He sees annual earnings gains topping 50 percent for the next three years.
Another good performer was Best Buy, a consumer electronics chain, at 3.2 percent of the fund. It rose 231.8 percent. "New management has engineered a terrific turnaround," Mr. Foreman said. He expects the company to exceed consensus earnings forecasts of $2.25 a share for its fiscal year ending in February 2000, up from $1.98 this year.
Mr. Foreman does not expect the economic troubles of Southeast Asia to end until late 1999. But he does not see further interest-rate cuts in the United States.
 
A New Industrial Revolution
For Jim D. Oelschlager, who manages the $57 million Pin Oak Aggressive Stock fund, technology is the bellwether sector for his fund -- and for the nation. Pin Oak returned 44 percent in the quarter, capturing eighth place among United States diversified funds.
"We believe that what's occurring in technology today is equivalent to the Industrial Revolution in the late 1800's," he said.
So it is not surprising that the 24 stocks in Pin Oak are mostly technology companies. One of his biggest fourth-quarter winners, up 69.1 percent, was Applied Materials, which makes semiconductor manufacturing equipment. "When the Asian contagion started in late 1997, no one thought anybody would build another plant," Mr. Oelschlager said. That pessimism has faded. He expects earnings growth of 20 to 30 percent a year for the next three to five years.
He also made money in Cisco Systems, the networking hardware giant, which rose 50.2 percent in the quarter. "There's a lot of questions as to who will be the big Internet winners, but we know Cisco will, because they're building the infrastructure used by the Amazon.coms and other Internet companies," he said. He expects earnings to grow more than 30 percent annually over three to five years.
As for 1999? "I'm a raging bull," he said.
 
Opportunity in the Storm
The third-quarter turmoil spelled fourth-quarter opportunity for Frederick R. Kobrick, who runs the $41.4 million Kobrick Capital fund, formerly Kobrick-Cendant Capital. He found much value in 1998, the fund's first year of operation, as stocks were periodically beaten down.
The fund, which owns 65 stocks, returned 40.3 percent for the quarter, placing 13th among United States diversified stock funds.
"When financials were chewed up in late summer, we bought a lot of banks and brokerages," which accounted for about 20 percent of the fund at the peak, he said.
Mr. Kobrick made money with Chase Manhattan, which he bought in early October at $40 a share. It finished the year at $71. He likes the company for its diversified income sources. "Chase does banking around the world and is expanding rapidly in Europe as it embraces the euro," Mr. Kobrick said. He expects per-share earnings growth of 30 percent in 1999.
Among his other fourth-quarter winners was the EMC Corporation, which he called the leader in mass data storage.
"Management is brilliant, and the company is run conservatively, so they usually beat earnings estimates," Mr. Kobrick said. He called EMC "a great long-term growth company" and expects EMC's stock price and sales to double in the next two and a half years. He sees a 40 percent increase in per-share earnings in 1999.
Mr. Kobrick said he was optimistic about 1999. "Profits will be better than the consensus thinks," he said.
 
A Convertible Hot Rod
Sandra K. Durn, who runs the $265.5 million Nicholas-Applegate Convertible Income Shares from San Diego, returned 19.9 percent in the fourth quarter, finishing in first place among taxable bond funds. She attributes the strong finish to the equity-type analysis she uses to buy convertible bonds. "We own convertibles where the underlying company has strong fundamentals and a positive outlook, which makes us different from other convertible managers, who focus more on yield than company prospects," she said.
In general, she expects convertible bonds in her portfolio to give her 80 percent of any upward movement of the common stock, but 50 percent or less of any downward movements. That is what kept her out of trouble in 1998, she said: "By focusing on these criteria, we've missed the big blow-ups in convertibles this year."
Among her top money makers were convertible preferred shares in Cox Communications, a cable company. "They have a growing subscriber base and are adding new services," Ms. Durn said. She projects a 15 percent annual earnings growth rate over five years.
She also made money with the convertibles of Costco, the warehouse retailer. The chain has posted what she described as "very impressive" sales growth of about 12 percent. "And they recently launched a new regional store in Chicago which is doing very well," she added.
In general, Ms. Durn is optimistic. "We feel that the market will continue to be strong, at least for the first part of 1999," she said. "Interest rates should stay low, which should prevent a slump in corporate profits."

HEADLINE: A NIGHT OUT WITH: Donald J. Trump;
Previewing The States Of Beauty

BYLINE: By BOB MORRIS 

 BODY:
ON Thursday, the temperature had dropped to a sub-freezing chill, but at Life, the nightclub on Bleecker Street, things were heating up. Donald J. Trump was expected at any moment for a promotional party for the Miss U.S.A. Pageant, which will be broadcast live next month on CBS.
In anticipation of his arrival, the contestants were all aflutter. Or maybe they were just cold. Near the door, Miss New York and Miss Connecticut stood around in skimpy skirts and tops absolutely unsuitable for winter. But since they had been instructed not to wear stockings with their BCBG designer outfits, they stoically exposed their toes and legs (midriffs and shoulders, too) to blasts of frigid air. The only thing that kept them warm was the idea of a moment with Mr. Trump. 
 "It's cold, but at least it's not Buffalo," said Miss New York, Kimberly Ann Pressler, a data entry specialist with glitter in her hair, who will attend college in Buffalo this fall.
So what did they know about Mr. Trump anyway?
"He makes lots of money," Miss Pressler said. "And his upstate casino helps our economy."
"He owns a lot of things," said Miss Connecticut, Christina D'Amico, a sales representative, who plans to pursue an M.B.A. degree after college, "including some property in Bridgeport."
Would they consider dating him?
With beauty queen diplomacy, they both said that he was wonderful, but perhaps not their type.
"I want to marry for love, not money," Miss D'Amico said.
When Mr. Trump finally arrived, he dispensed two kisses to Shawnae Jebbia, Miss U.S.A. 1998, who, with the eager tone of a child reporting good news to Father, told him about a new job she had just nailed as a television host. "I'm going to become a TV personality," she said.
After congratulating her, he moved on to peddle his pageant to reporters. "What I do is successful because of the esthetics," said Mr. Trump, who owns part of the Miss Universe Organization (producer of Miss U.S.A.) and is planning to start a modeling agency. "People love my buildings and my pageants."
Downstairs, the self-appointed arbiter of all things beautiful arrived to whoops and cheers. He was swamped by young women. "Looking good," he said. One woman, who called him "Donald," asked for a kiss. He obliged, then asked, "Do I know you?" It turned out he did.
As he posed and mingled, Mr. Trump conjured a connection, however tenuous, to his contestants. Miss New Jersey, for example, has parents who go to his Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City. "That's what I love to hear," Mr. Trump said. He told Miss North Carolina that he plays golf in Pinehurst, and Miss Colorado that he recently got back from Aspen. "I own property there," he said.
One place where he has not staked a claim yet is Rhode Island. He regretted that. "Look how beautiful Miss Rhode Island is," he said before pressing more flesh -- hands, arms and an occasional bare shoulder.
"You're all so beautiful," he said. Then, he was out the door, leaving his fans to their own resources. To that end, Joy Hall, Miss North Carolina, was seen giving her phone number to Mitch Marrow, a defensive end for the Carolina Panthers, who had promised her seats to a game.
"They better be good seats," Miss Hall said to a friend, after he had moved on. "If you give your phone number to someone, you should at least end up on the 50-yard line."
Mr. Trump is not the only one to understand the art of the deal.

HEADLINE: To Russia With Gifts For a Partner on Ice

BYLINE: By MARCIA BIEDERMAN 

 BODY:
WHAT do you get the teen-age girl who has everything? A horse? A Miata? How about a real live Russian ice-dance partner?
Two years ago, when Ariel Williams, then a 10th grader at the Dalton School in Manhattan, began to show promise in ice dancing, her mother, Marian Williams, scouted for a full-time partner for her. The search led to Dmitri Boundoukin, a Russian-born skater who was soap-opera handsome. 
 But the economic imbalances between Russia and America being what they are, Mrs. Williams found herself offering to cover all of Mr. Boundoukin's personal and training costs, which can run to tens of thousands of dollars a year. In the spring of 1997, she and her daughter moved from New York to Marlboro, Mass., so Ariel could train year round with Mr. Boundoukin, who was 19 and lived near a favorite Russian coach in Shrewsbury, Mass.
The bills, Mrs. Williams said, including living expenses for both partners, coaching fees, dance lessons and costumes (which can cost $1,000 for women and $500 for men), were paid by her former husband, Gary W. Williams, a partner at the investment banking firm of Goldman, Sachs. "I'm lucky," Mrs. Williams said. "My ex-husband pays for it."
Such arrangements are increasingly common in ice dancing, a sport that attracts many American girls but few American boys, according to skaters, their parents and senior figures in the sport. They say that girls' parents often dangle the keys to a car or a house, along with a promise of all expenses paid, to get foreign-born skaters to lead their daughters in waltzes and tangos around a rink.
"It's buying a partner," said Judy Blumberg, a former national champion ice dancer whose family did not support the American-born Michael Seibert when they won three medals at world championships and finished fourth at the Olympics in 1984. (That was the year Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean, ice dancing's most famous pairing, won the gold medal.)
American boys, who prefer hockey, are seldom interested in ballroom dances on ice. (The sport differs from freestyle pairs in that there are no jumps and no lifts above the waist.) The dominant figure in the sport now is the diva Pasha Grishuk of Russia. So male partners in this country are often recruited from abroad. The laws of supply and demand have led young men from Russia, where ice dancing is just another sport, to increase what they demand for their services. But the largesse of the girls' parents means that "they'll never be independent," Ms. Blumberg said.
"I think most Russian boys expect to be taken care of," she continued. "They want an expensive costume, or this car and not the other car."
NOT all the foreign-born partners are Russian. Susan Chalom of West Bloomfield, Mich., said she scoured the nation for a year for a partner for her daughter, Eve, then 12. The search ended in Boston, where Eve tried out with Mathew Gates of Hitchum, England. Mrs. Chalom, recalling that tryout, said, "I remember I was filming, and I was filming with my mouth open."
In the seven years since then, Mrs. Chalom said, she has paid virtually all expenses for Mr. Gates. For him to come from England and live in her home, she had to become his legal guardian, since he was then 16. When her son left for Yale, Mr. Gates got his room and his car. Her largest expenses, though, were training and travel. Costs for the two skaters now top $90,000 a year, she said.
"I kind of go with what my kids want," Mrs. Chalom said. "Eve is the one who dragged me to the rink." Eve lost much of her hearing when she was hit by a car at age 4. "I probably went along with it more agreeably because of that," her mother said. Where has the money come from? "There was a man," Mrs. Chalom said: her former husband, Eve's father, Edward Chalom.
These days the two train in Plano, Texas, and Mrs. Chalom pays for them to live with two Dallas families. And Mr. Gates, now 23, earns some money by teaching skating so he can pay for incidentals. "Like shaving cream," Mrs. Chalom said.
Mr. Gates said he is thankful for the Chaloms' support. "But I am giving Eve as much opportunity as she gives me to go where she wants to go," he said.
The partnership has worked well. The couple have won medals at the national championships and were on the United States World Team in 1997. But even with that success, Mrs. Chalom agrees with critics in the sport who say that such partnerships often do not result in medals, because skaters are not matched by leg length and proficiency, but rather by financial factors. She said she knew of an American novice competitor whose parents went to Russia to find her a partner. Although the man was an elite skater in Russia, he agreed to compete as a novice here.
"But he pulled her around the ice," Mrs. Chalom said. "She didn't win."
Oleg Fediukov said Mrs. Chalom must have been describing him. Mr. Fediukov, who is with his third American partner (all three families have supported him), said that six years ago his initial patrons, Julieanna Sacchetti, then 14, and her parents traveled to Russia in search of a partner and found him.
Soon he was installed in their home in Wellesley, Mass. "They were pretty upscale people," he said. But he described skating with the inexperienced girl as "six months in hell."
Julieanna "didn't really trust me and my knowledge," he said. He added, "We couldn't get along -- I would say something innocent, and she would get upset and tell her mother."
Christine Sacchetti, Julieanna's mother, tells it differently. She said that Mr. Fediukov was too advanced to partner a novice, but that he did not explain that. "He played dumb," she said. (Mr. Fediukov responded that he had made his proficiency clear to the family before coming to the United States, and that they had seen him skate with Julieanna.)
Of the conflicts with her daughter, Mrs. Sacchetti said, "He was rude and unkind and unfeeling toward her."
"We were naive," said Julieanna Sacchetti, who is now 20. She said she knows other American families who were taken advantage of by what she called manipulative Russian skaters "because these parents love their daughters so much."
In any event, Mr. Fediukov left the Sacchettis. Since 1996 he has skated with Debbie Koegel, whose family has no complaints. Her mother, Susan Clayman, said she and her husband, Martin Clayman, pay most of the $60,000 in training and living expenses for the couple, who finished second last month at the Eastern sectional championships for senior-level ice dancers in Oldsmar, Fla.
Ms. Koegel's mother bristled at the suggestion that supporting Mr. Fediukov is tantamount to buying a partner. "Oleg is not paid to skate with my daughter," she said. "Oleg wants to skate with my daughter."
No doubt that is true, especially since Mr. Fediukov, now 26, and Ms. Koegel, 21, are a couple off the ice as well, sharing a town house in Brookhaven, Pa. Mrs. Clayman said Mr. Fediukov "is not dressing in Calvin Kleins and Polos and driving a Corvette -- he has a broken-down Honda that needs a radiator."
But then there is the case of the physician and his wife who brought a partner from Russia for their daughter and presented him with the room and car formerly belonging to her brother, only to see him leave after a single month with the complaint, "American girls can't skate."
"It was a nightmare," said the girl's mother, who spoke on condition of anonymity. But she rejected the suggestion that she and her husband had been victimized. "We just got so caught up in it," she said.
Leslie Gamez, the team director for the United States Figure Skating Association, said such situations are "a private matter between those two individuals." The association, the sport's governing body, does not enter such disputes.
Many parents reject any criticism about their part in the ice-dance "bachelor auction." Typically, they maintain that it is other families who are taken advantage of, that their daughter's partner is a hard worker with modest needs. Even when the partnerships win no medals, some parents say they would do it again.
BEFORE teaming up with Ariel Williams, Mr. Boundoukin was the partner of Tara Modlin, whose parents, Sherry and Bobby Modlin of Garden City, N.Y., provided housing for him for two years in Lake Placid, N.Y., shopped for his groceries and covered all his training costs.
"Everybody I know thought I was nuts," said Mr. Modlin, who owns a textile exporting business in Manhattan. He said he used to drive 600 miles round trip to see his wife and daughter in Lake Placid on weekends. But he said he has no regrets. "It cost me a fortune, but I wouldn't give back one minute of it," he said, because Tara "earned it" by winning medal after medal as a novice.
The Modlins didn't just open their wallets. "We got into an adoption situation," Mrs. Modlin said. Until Mr. Boundoukin turned 18, the Modlins became his legal guardians so that he and Tara could compete in the United States National Figure Skating Championships. (He needed an alien-registration card to do so, and their guardianship assured that he could get one. Noncitizens, however, are ineligible for Olympic teams.)
After finishing last among the junior-level skaters in a field of 13 at the 1997 nationals, the Modlin-Boundoukin team broke up. Tara Modlin said there were tensions after an unsuccessful season capped by a last-minute change of coach and program. The family said there were also romantic problems. "It was uncomfortable that his attraction was bigger to me than mine to him," Tara Modlin said. (Mr. Boundoukin refused repeated requests for interviews on the events surrounding his skating career in the United States.)
Her father was relieved. Although he considers Mr. Boundoukin "a great kid," he did not view him as marriage material for his daughter, who is now 20 and is majoring in sociology at the University of Pennsylvania. Tara, who no longer skates competitively, said she misses Dima, as her former partner is known, but she said he and other Russian skaters in America didn't "get" her interest in academics.
"After a while," Mr. Modlin said, "I wanted him to stay away from my daughter. I wanted her to pay attention to books."
The Modlins continued to pay Mr. Boundoukin's rent for a few months until he got on his feet, around the time he teamed up with Ariel Williams.
In interviews last year, Mrs. Williams, Ariel's mother, said the family at first provided sole support for Mr. Boundoukin, but eventually a group that helps "promising skaters" began giving him support. She later confirmed that the group was the New England Amateur Skating Foundation.
Herbert E. Kaplan, the president of the foundation, a charitable trust based in Providence, R.I., said Mr. Boundoukin is one of 100 skaters for whom the foundation raised $600,000 last year.
Ariel's father, Gary Williams, declined to be interviewed, but a family friend, who called this reporter at what he said was Mr. Williams's behest, said Mr. Williams was contributing to the Amateur Skating Foundation. The friend, who refused to be quoted by name, would not say how much.
Some people in the sport say that the foundation provides a funnel for families to give money to skaters while receiving a tax deduction. For example, Ms. Clayman, the mother of Debbie Koegel, said she and other family members pay the nearly $60,000 annual expenses of Ms. Koegel and Mr. Fediukov through the foundation because of the "tax advantage."
Mr. Kaplan said: "We support a lot of Russian skaters. I call it my rent-a-Russian program." He said donors cannot earmark checks for a specific skater (which would threaten the tax deductibility of their contributions). But he said they can "suggest" recipients, subject to the approval of a three-member foundation committee.
Ninety percent of donations are under $100, he said. He would not say if larger donations had come in with the suggestion that they go to Mr. Boundoukin. There is "nothing unusual or untoward" about the grants to the young man, he said.
Don Roberts, a spokesman in Washington for the Internal Revenue Service, said the foundation's arrangements appeared to violate no tax regulations, so long as it remained in control of the funds.
So far, Mr. Boundoukin and his partners have not reached the sport's senior ranks. The Boundoukin-Williams team, scheduled to make its first important appearance at a regional competition in Florida last month, withdrew after a "medical emergency," a competition organizer said. It has not registered for the national championships Feb. 7 to 14 in Salt Lake City.
Within skating, people like to gossip about the Russian partners, but few raise serious objections. Skating, they say, is expensive, and the demands of training do not allow for a full-time job. Dick Button, the two-time Olympic gold medalist and television skating announcer, said it's "perfectly fine" for American families to support foreign-born skaters.
"I am only interested in good skating," he said. "I don't care if the person comes from Boise or Vladivostok."
Until more American boys discover the joys of a twizzle, a step maneuver during a waltz, the imbalance is not likely to change. "I keep saying to these little hockey boys, 'You know, you could have a great future in figure skating, and all these girls in your arms,' " Mrs. Williams said.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS REPORT;
Saying No to Summer Panic Brings a Winter of Content

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
IN a dramatic comeback that cheered the holders of more than 100 million mutual fund accounts, the fund industry turned in a rollicking performance in the final quarter of 1998. The average United States diversified stock fund returned 18.8 percent, the fattest gain for any quarter since 1982, when the business was less than one-eighth its present size.
Buoyed by a Federal Reserve whose interest-rate cuts clearly reflected more concern about heading off world recession than about fueling stock prices, the market rewarded the overwhelming majority of fund investors who, rather than running for cover, either sat tight during the midyear turbulence or used it to pick up bargains. 
 Their persistence allowed their fund managers to avoid the necessity of selling shares or husbanding cash. And the rewards in many cases were fourth-quarter returns that exceeded the gain in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, a leading benchmark that has traditionally been hard for stock fund managers to beat.
But while a half-dozen categories of actively managed stock funds surpassed the 20.9 percent gain in the S.& P., it was growth funds that really excelled -- a trend that embraced companies of all sizes.
Growth funds that invest in stocks with large capitalizations -- capitalization is the total market value of all of a company's shares -- jumped an average of 26.3 percent in the October-through-December period and 36.5 percent for all of 1998. Mid-cap funds also rallied and came in a close second, up 26.1 percent for the quarter and 18.3 percent for the year.
In an even sharper recovery, beaten-down small-cap growth funds racked up a 24 percent fourth-quarter advance that hoisted their full-year return from negative territory to a 4.3 percent gain.
For the growth funds, the chief advantage was economic turmoil abroad, which caused fears of a recession at home. Companies that are not closely tied to the business cycle were at a premium, and many investors sought quality within the stock market.
In particular, many growth funds had a high representation of telecommunications and technology stocks, which rebounded with a vengeance. Some fund managers have even ventured into Internet rockets like Amazon.com, the bookseller, and Ebay, an auctioneer, which rose 187.8 percent and 435.4 percent, respectively, in the quarter.
Specialty funds that hold the stocks of technology companies did best of all, surging 41.7 percent, according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial publisher.
But bond funds, to the surprise of some people, were flat by comparison. Indeed, 15 of 21 classifications eked out gains of less than 1 percent. Long-Term Government funds lost 1.2 percent, on average. Emerging-markets bond funds returned 12.3 percent, in contrast to disastrous quarters earlier in the year. This disappointing fate for the bond funds, analysts said, showed that investors had anticipated the Fed's rate cuts, the first of which came during September.
Many investors seeking refuge from foreign turmoil moved to Treasuries, largely ignoring corporate and tax-exempt municipal issues. Funds investing in convertible bonds, sometimes a substitute for stocks, were high performers for the quarter.
Although much of Asia remains in recession, markets there rebounded smartly on anticipations of recovery. Stock funds investing in Pacific Rim countries and Asia, but excluding Japan, rose an average of 27.6 percent in the fourth quarter. But these funds still suffered a loss of 10.4 percent for all of 1998.
Matthews Korea and Matthews Pacific Tiger were the biggest international winners in the quarter, soaring 102 percent and 40.5 percent, respectively. Fidelity's Japan Small Company fund surged 34.8 percent.
THE remarkable stock-market comeback in the United States and elsewhere followed one of the worst selloffs in years, producing a sharp whipsaw for some investors who played the game of trying to time the market's ups and downs.
But the revelation of 1998 may well be the steadfastness of the nation's 67 million fund investors, about half of whom also own stocks directly, when confronted with a mid-July to early-October plunge that many argue was a genuine, if compressed, bear market.
Despite industry assurances that an overwhelming majority of shareholders would stand fast, there were skeptics. When the sun is shining, they argued, it is easy for investors to say they'll hang in there -- especially if they have never suffered through such a slump before. But when the storm comes, they added, many people change their tune.
Yet investors were resilient. "The selloff was fairly steep, and the reaction was very mild," said John Rea, chief economist at the Investment Company Institute. For the first time since 1990, equity fund investors in August sold more than they bought, but the outflow was a mere four-tenths of 1 percent of assets, he said.
And while the effects of the plunge lingered into the fourth quarter, when inflows lagged behind, Mr. Rea contended that one thing had become clear: "Long-term investors are willing to accept some short-term volatility."
Still, a few months' decline -- and even the considerably longer slump for small-company stocks -- is not as brutal or disheartening as a more traditional bear market, like the one that lasted for most of 1973 and 1974 and slashed the value of blue-chip stocks by 40 percent.
Almost as big as the market's emphasis on growth during the latest quarter was its preference for larger companies.
"If you were in big growth companies, you were in fat city," said Robert C. Doll, chief investment officer at Oppenheimer Funds in New York, which has 50 funds with a total of $100 billion in assets. "But if you were small and value-oriented, you got taken to the cleaners."
Sheer size is increasingly important, agreed Beth Terrana, portfolio manager of the Fidelity Fund, a $9.7 billion member of the giant Fidelity Investment group, which has been generally shedding a reluctance to pay premium prices for the most popular large-cap stocks.
"I've been very strongly in favor of big-cap stocks," she said. "The world has become excruciatingly competitive," she added, and in a slow-growth environment "he who spends the most normally wins." Large-cap companies have the financial heft to spend with abandon.
The biggest stocks tend to be bought by the biggest funds, since managers can take meaningful positions in them without unduly affecting prices.
Indeed, the biggest fund of all, Fidelity Magellan, with $83.6 billion in assets, not only outperformed the S.& P. 500 last year for the first time since 1993, but recorded a fourth-quarter gain of 27.2 percent, second-highest among the nation's largest 25 funds. First was the Janus Fund, at 28.4 percent.
Robert Stansky, Magellan's manager repositioned the fund, which is closed to most new investors, late in the summer; he piled into growth stocks and beaten down high-technology issues.
For the full year, Magellan's 33.6 percent advance was surpassed among giant funds only by the Janus Fund, at 38.9 percent; Fidelity Blue Chip Growth, up 34.8 percent, and American Century Twentieth Century Ultra, up 34.6 percent.
Despite recent successes by portfolio managers, passive investment continues to grow. Money is pouring into Vanguard 500 Index, now the second-biggest fund, at $74 billion.
A rising proportion of fund buyers, newly sensitive to advisory fees, trading costs and tax issues, are willing to settle for returns that come close to matching market averages rather than chasing the hot-shot manager of the day, said Kurt Cerulli, principal of Cerulli Associates, a research and investment counseling firm in Boston.
"The argument for indexing is pretty compelling," Mr. Cerulli said, noting that management fees for index funds run as little as one-fifth of a percentage point a year, compared with three or four times as much for the typical fund. Fees can exceed 1.5 percent when other expenses, like marketing charges, are included.
While the market was showering large and growth-oriented funds with outsized gains, managers bent on sniffing out value in undiscovered or beaten-down or cyclically depressed shares remain frustrated.
"It's painful" being out of fashion, said Ronald Spaulding, the value-oriented chief investment officer for eight stock funds and five bond funds advised by the Safeco Corporation of Seattle. "The market always returns to value, to fundamentals, at some point. The question is timing."
The underperformance of value managers persisted throughout the year; particularly striking was the chasm that developed between investment extremes, noted John Rekenthaler, research director at Morningstar. Investors in the average small-cap value fund suffered a 7 percent loss during 1998, while large-cap growth funds climbed 36.5 percent, on average, a difference of 43.5 percent. "I haven't seen the like of it," Mr. Rekenthaler said. "I'd be surprised if we've ever had a number that large."
ONE lesson may be that fund performance, at least in the short term, often depends more on investment fashion than on the skills of portfolio managers. In practice, this means that because fashion is as fickle in markets as in clothes, it makes no sense to chase after last year's winners.
Yet choice in mutual funds -- by some counts there are now more funds than stocks -- continues to expand. The proliferation is prompting many investors who once regarded funds as simplifying their investment life to seek professional help with complexity.
One new fund is a closed-end offering called Value Line No. 1 Strategy Trust. It will invest in the 100 stocks given a top ranking for timeliness -- defined as a likelihood to rise more quickly than other stocks -- by the Value Line Investment Survey.
Some new products border on the eccentric. Trying a different take on the indexing phenomenon, the new Guinness Flight Wired Index fund will invest in 40 so-called new blue chips, as designated by Wired Magazine. The Wired list is intended to track the information economy of the next century, much as the Dow Jones industrial average, started in 1896, was intended to track the industrial economy of the 20th century.
The companies it chose, Wired said, display "not just intelligent use of technology, but also more abstract notions, including globalism, innovation and strategic vision."

HEADLINE: Funny, They Don't Look Like Fat Cats

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

 BODY:
THREE decades ago, Congress, embarrassed by the disclosure that 155 wealthy Americans had paid no Federal income taxes, enacted legislation aimed at preventing the very rich from shielding their wealth in tax shelters.
Today, that legislation, creating the alternative minimum tax, is instead snaring a rapidly growing number of middle-class taxpayers, forcing them to pay additional tax or to lose some of their tax breaks. 
 Of the more than two million taxpayers who will be subject this year to the alternative minimum tax, or A.M.T., about half have incomes of $30,000 to $100,000. Some are single parents with jobs; some are people making as little as $527 a week. Over all, the number of people affected by the tax is expected to grow 26 percent a year for the next decade.
But many of the wealthy will not be among them. Even with the A.M.T., the number of taxpayers making more than $200,000 who pay no taxes has risen to more than 2,000 each year.
How a 1969 law aimed at the tax-shy rich became a growing burden on moderate earners illustrates how tax policy in Washington can be a hall of mirrors.
While some Republican Congressmen favor eliminating the tax, other lawmakers say such a move would be an expensive tax break for the wealthy -- or at least would be perceived that way, and thus would be politically unpalatable. And any overhaul of the system would need to compensate for the $6.6 billion that individuals now pay under the A.M.T. This year, such payments will account for almost 1 percent of all individual income tax revenue.
"This is a classic case of both Congress and the Administration agreeing that the tax doesn't make much sense, but not being able to agree on doing anything about it," said C. Eugene Steuerle, an economist with the Urban Institute, a nonprofit research organization in Washington.
Mr. Steuerle was a Treasury Department tax official in 1986, when an overhaul of the tax code set the stage for drawing the middle class into the A.M.T.
In eliminating most tax shelters for the wealthy, Congress decided to treat exemptions for children and deductions for medical expenses just like special credits for investors in oil wells, if they cut too deeply into a household's taxable income.
Congress decided that once these "tax preferences" exceeded certain amounts -- $40,000 for a married couple, for example -- people would be moved out of the regular income tax and into the alternative minimum tax. At the time, the threshold was high enough to affect virtually no one but the rich. But it has since been raised only once -- by 12.5 percent, to $45,000 for a married couple -- while the cost of living has risen 43 percent. And so the limits have sneaked up on growing numbers of taxpayers of more modest means.
"Everyone knew back then that it had problems that had to be fixed," Mr. Steuerle recalled. "They just said, 'next year.' "
But "next year" has never come -- and it is unlikely to arrive in 1999, either. While tax policy experts have known for years that the middle class would be drawn into the A.M.T., few taxpayers have been clamoring for change.
Among those few, however, are David and Margaret Klaassen of Marquette, Kan. Mr. Klaassen, a lawyer who lives in and works out of a farmhouse, made $89,751.07 in 1997 and paid $5,989 in Federal income taxes. Four weeks ago, the Internal Revenue Service sent the Klaassens a notice demanding $3,761 more under the alternative minimum tax, including a penalty because the I.R.S. said the Klaassens knew they owed the A.M.T.
Mr. Klaassen acknowledges that he knew the I.R.S. would assert that he was subject to the A.M.T., but he says the law was not meant to apply to his family. "I've never invested in a tax shelter," he said. "I don't even have municipal bonds."
The Klaassens do, however, have 13 children and their attendant medical expenses -- including the costs of caring for their second son, Aaron, 17, who has battled leukemia for years. It was those exemptions and deductions that subjected them to the A.M.T.
"What kind of policy taxes you for spending money to save your child's life?" Mr. Klaassen asked.
The tax affects taxpayers in three ways. Some, like the Klaassens, pay the tax at either a 26 percent or a 28 percent rate because they have more than $45,000 in exemptions and deductions. Others do not pay the A.M.T. itself, but they cannot take the full tax breaks they would have received under the regular income tax system without running up against limits set by the A.M.T. The A.M.T. can also convert tax-exempt income from certain bonds and from exercising incentive stock options into taxable income.
It may be useful to think of the alternative minimum tax as a parallel universe to the regular income tax system, similar in some ways but more complex and with its own classifications of deductions, its own rates and its own paperwork. The idea was that taxpayers who had escaped the regular tax universe by piling on credits and deductions would enter this new universe to pay their fair share. (Likewise, there is a corporate A.M.T. that parallels the corporate income tax.)
At first, the burden of the A.M.T. fell mainly on the shoulders of business owners and investors, said Robert S. McIntyre, executive director of Citizens for Tax Justice, a nonprofit group in Washington that says the tax system favors the rich. Based on I.R.S. data, Mr. McIntyre said he found that 37 percent of A.M.T. revenue in 1990 was a result of business owners using losses from previous years to reduce their regular income taxes; an additional 18 percent was because of big deductions for state and local taxes.
But that has begun to shift, largely as a result of the 1986 changes, which eliminated most tax shelters and lowered tax rates.
 WHEN President Reagan and Congress were overhauling the tax code, they could not make the projected revenues under the new rules equal those under the old system. Huge, and growing, budget deficits made it politically essential for the official estimates to show that after tax reform, the same amount of money would flow to Washington.
One solution, said Mr. Steuerle, the former Treasury official, was to count personal and dependent exemptions and some medical expenses as preferences to be reduced or ignored under the A.M.T, just as special credits for petroleum investments and other tax shelters are.
Mortgage interest and charitable gifts were not counted as preferences, according to tax policy experts who worked on the legislation, because they generated more money than was needed.
But the A.M.T. has not stayed "revenue neutral," in Washington parlance.
The regular income tax was indexed for inflation in 1984, so that taxpayers would not get pushed into higher tax brackets simply because their income kept pace with the cost of living.
The A.M.T. limits, however, have not been indexed. The total allowable exemptions before the tax kicks in have been fixed since 1993 at $45,000 for a married couple filing jointly. For unmarried people, the total amount is now $33,750, and for married people filing separately, it is $22,500.
If the limit had been indexed since 1986, when the A.M.T. was overhauled, it would be about $57,000 for married couples filing jointly -- and most middle-income households would still be exempt.
Mr. Steuerle said he warned at the time that including "normal, routine deductions and exemptions that everyone takes" in the list of preferences would eventually turn the A.M.T. into a tax on the middle class.
That appears to be exactly what has happened.
For example, a married person who makes just $527 a week and files her tax return separately can be subject to the tax, said David S. Hulse, an assistant professor of accounting at the University of Kentucky.
And the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, which allows a $500-a-child tax credit as well as education credits, may make even more middle-class families subject to the A.M.T. by reducing the value of those credits.
Two Treasury Department economists recently calculated that largely because of the new credits, the number of households making $30,000 to $50,000 who must pay the alternative minimum tax will more than triple in the coming decade. The economists, Robert Rebelein and Jerry Tempalski, also calculated that for households making $15,000 to $30,000 annually, A.M.T. payments will grow 25-fold, to $1.2 billion, by 2008.
Last year, many more people would have been subject to the A.M.T. if Congress had not made a last-minute fix pushed by Representative Richard E. Neal, Democrat of Massachusetts, that -- for 1998 only -- exempted the new child and education credits. The move came after I.R.S. officials told Congress that the credits added enormous complexity to calculating tax liability. Figuring out how much the A.M.T. would reduce the credits was beyond the capacity of most taxpayers and even many paid tax preparers, the I.R.S. officials said.
 EVEN if Congress makes a permanent fix to the problems created by the child and education credits, it will put only a minor drag on the spread of the A.M.T. as long as the tax is not indexed for inflation. The two Treasury economists calculated that revenues from the tax would climb to $25 billion in 2008 without a fix, or to $21.9 billion with one.
In 1999, if there is no exemption for the credits, a single parent who does not itemize deductions but who makes $50,000 and takes a credit for the costs of caring for two children while he works, will be subject to the A.M.T, estimated Jeffrey Pretsfelder, an editor at RIA Group, a publisher of tax information for professionals.
If the tax laws are not changed, 8.8 million taxpayers will have to pay the A.M.T. a decade from now, the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimated last month. Add in the taxpayers who will not receive the full value of their deductions because they run up against the limits set by the A.M.T., and the total grows to 11.6 million taxpayers -- 92 percent of whom have incomes of less than $200,000, the two Treasury economists estimated.
While many lawmakers and Treasury officials have criticized the impact of the tax on middle-class taxpayers, there are few signs of change, as Republicans and the Administration talk past each other.
Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who as the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee is the chief tax writer, said the A.M.T. should be eliminated in the next budget.
"Unfortunately, the A.M.T. tax can penalize large families, which is part of the reason why Republicans for years have tried to eliminate it or at least reduce it," Mr. Archer said. "Unfortunately, President Clinton blocked our efforts each time."
Lawrence H. Summers, the Deputy Treasury Secretary, said the Administration was "very concerned that the A.M.T. has a growing impact on middle-class families, including by diluting the child credit, education credits and other crucial tax benefits, and we hope to address this issue in the President's budget.
"Subject to budget constraints, we look forward to working with Congress on this important issue," he continued.
That revenue concerns have thwarted exempting the middle class runs counter to the reason Congress initially imposed the tax.
"You need an A.M.T. because people who make a lot of money should pay some income taxes," said Mr. McIntyre, of Citizens for Tax Justice. "If you believe, like Mr. Archer and a lot of Republicans do, that the more you make the less in taxes you should pay, then of course you are against the A.M.T. But somehow I don't think most people see it that way."
THE Klaassens, meanwhile, are challenging the A.M.T. in Federal Court. The United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit is scheduled to hear arguments in March on their claim that the tax infringes their religious freedom. The Klaassens, who are Presbyterians, say they believe children "are a blessing from God, and so we do not practice birth control," Mr. Klaassen said.
When Mr. Klaassen wrote to an I.R.S. official complaining that a $1,085 bill for the A.M.T. for 1994 resulted from the size of his family, he got back a curt letter saying that his "analysis of the alternative minimum tax's effect on large families was interesting but inappropriate" and advising him that it was medical deductions, not family size, that subjected him to the A.M.T.
Under the regular tax system, medical expenses above 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income -- the last line on the front page of Form 1040 -- are deductible. Under the A.M.T., the threshold is raised to 10 percent.
Still doubting the I.R.S.'s math, Mr. Klaassen decided to test what would have happened had he filed the same tax return, changing only the number of children he claimed as dependents. He found that if he had seven or fewer children, the A.M.T. would not have applied in 1994.
But the eighth child set off the A.M.T., at a cost of $223. Having nine children raised the bill to $717. And 10 children, the number he had in 1994, increased that sum to $1,085 -- the amount the I.R.S. said was due.
"We love this country and we believe in paying taxes," Mr. Klaassen said. "But we cannot believe that Congress ever intended to apply this tax to our family solely because of how many children we choose to have. And I have shown that we are subject to the A.M.T. solely because we have chosen not to limit the size of our family."
The I.R.S., in papers opposing the Klaassens, noted that tax deductions are not a right but a matter of "legislative grace."
Mr. Klaassen turned to the Federal courts after losing in Tax Court. The opinion by Tax Court Judge Robert N. Armen Jr. was summed up this way by Tax Notes, a magazine that critiques tax policy: "Congress intended the alternative minimum tax to affect large families when it made personal exemptions a preference item."
Several tax experts said that Mr. Klaassen had little chance of success in the courts because the statute treating children as tax preferences was clear. They also said that nothing in the A.M.T. laws was specifically aimed at his religious beliefs.
Meanwhile, for people who make $200,000 or more, the A.M.T. will be less of a burden this year because of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, which included a provision lowering the maximum tax rate on capital gains for both the regular tax and the A.M.T. to 20 percent.
Mr. Rebelein and Mr. Tempalski, the Treasury Department economists, calculated recently that people making more than $200,000 would pay a total of 4 percent less in A.M.T. for 1998 because of the 1997 law. By 2008, their savings will be 9 percent, largely as a result of lower capital gains rates and changed accounting rules for business owners.
"This law was passed to catch people who use tax shelters to avoid their obligations," Mr. Klaassen said. "But instead of catching them it hits people like me. This is just nuts."
 
Three Ways to Deal With a Taxing Problem
 
PRESIDENT CLINTON, his tax policy advisers and the Republicans who control the tax writing committees in Congress all agree that the alternative minimum tax is a growing problem for the middle class. But there is no agreement on what to do. Here are some options that have been discussed:
 
RAISE THE EXEMPTION -- Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who is the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, two years ago proposed raising the $45,000 A.M.T. exemption for a married couple by $1,000. But that would leave many middle-class families subject to the tax, because it would not fully account for inflation. To do that would require an exemption of about $57,000, followed by automatic inflation adjustments. That is the most widely favored approach, drawing support from people like J. D. Foster, executive director of the Tax Foundation, a group supported by corporations, and Robert S. McIntyre, executive director of Citizens for Tax Justice, which is financed in part by unions and contends that the tax system favors the rich.
 
EXEMPT CHILD AND EDUCATION CREDITS -- For 1998 only, Congress exempted the child tax credit and the education tax credits from the A.M.T. But millions of taxpayers will lose these credits, or get only part of them, unless Congress makes a fix each year or permanently exempts them.
 
ELIMINATE IT -- Mr. Archer and other Republicans want to get rid of the A.M.T. but have not proposed how to make up for the lost revenue, which in a decade is expected to grow to $25 billion annually. Recently, however, Mr. Archer has said that in a period of Federal budget surpluses, it may be time to scrap the budget rules that require paying for tax cuts with reduced spending or tax increases elsewhere.

The N.B.A. Is All About Spinning

BYLINE: By ROBERT LIPSYTE

 BODY:
It's going to be tougher now. Rooting for local teams or resenting individual players is no longer smart enough. Now that political-style spin has engaged the arena, the National Basketball Association spectator has to bring to the court an attitude worthy of the disinfomercials that have emerged since the lockout ended. "Love that game" is a peeling bumper sticker.
How will you greet the new season? As a rebirth after a racial Armageddon, a labor-management fiasco, a triumph of small over tall, a mockery of working-class values, a brilliant plan to bring us more quickly to the playoffs? It really doesn't matter what you choose, so long as you don't just sit there and moan when they dunk. Find an angle. You'll win with a spin. 
 Real fans can read the players' collapse in the signs in other sports. The Jets' surge was credited to Bill Parcells's friendly fascism; obviously, players need to be manipulated and ordered. Then there is the widening scandal of the International Olympic Committee; obviously, the real sport in sport is business, and you can't beat the bosses at that.
Most significantly, Yogi Berra finally rolled over for George Steinbrenner. It was the sensible thing to do. First of all, Yogi needed publicity for his new museum. More important, as men age, there are few tighter bonds than those between old enemies. Who knows you so well, has thought about you as often and as deeply? Yogi and George, after all, are cartoon figures in the minds of almost everyone but themselves. Yogi's refusal to set foot in the Stadium while George was the owner was noble, and still is, although it became stupid. Nobody cares anymore that Yogi was crudely fired as Yankee manager. Since then, almost everyone in America has been crudely fired, in one way or another. Yogi is not stupid. George came to New Jersey last week. Yogi will go to the Bronx next season. All will be right with that world.
As one who admired Walt Frazier, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Isiah Thomas above all others, the sight of Patrick Ewing, clogging the Knicks' heart and fronting the players' association, was disheartening. It was too easy for me to believe that he was a puppet of David Falk, as he was once a puppet of the recently resigned Georgetown coach, John Thompson. Actually, I do not necessarily believe this, but I am not privy to accurate basketball rumors, much less the truth, so I will enjoy the self-interested takes on this past nonplaying season, including the following:
1. It was just a battle between soft little white guys, David Stern and David Falk, who couldn't make the varsity cut in high school. The commissioner who created the modern sport and the super agent who represented an aging corps of super players went man-to-man for control of the game. This is an alluring spin for most fans, who are soft little white guys. No matter which David won, we won, too.
2. The league won big. By dragging the players back on court without ceding to their major demands, the N.B.A. stuffed the greed genie back in the bottle and capped it, giving inspiration to all the beleaguered conglomerates struggling with ungrateful workers. Most media outlets, owned by conglomerates and staffed by ingrates, support this spin.
3. The players really won. By delaying the season, making reasonable demands (the Smith College economist and players union consultant, Andrew Zimbalist, was best on this) and showing themselves as a diverse group, in class, intelligence and financial need, they transcended the living animated figures marketed by the N.B.A. and became people. Also, they were the ones who saved the season.
4. TV won. The length of the regular N.B.A. season and the need to carry it has always bothered television and advertising (same thing) executives who have always preferred to cut to the chase, where the audience and the rates are. Now, a truncated season will feel as if it has the urgency of playoff time.
5. The fans won. The idea of a backlash, that Joe Sixpack, whoever the suits think that is, will not come back because he is hurt, disgusted or discovered the Monet exhibit while the Celtics were dark, is not only silly. It is also enormously pleasing to Joe, his investment banker and his antique book dealer, because they think there will be concessions. The game will find new ways to entertain him, give him free trinkets for showing up, make his seat warm.
6. The gasbags won. Everyone with access to ink, air time or cyberspace will have a chance to pontificate at length about the meaning of all this until it is time to watch games, at which time we will pontificate on the effect of all this on dunking, before we go back to our real jobs, which is uncovering the love-that-game billionaire owner who was raised in a log cabin without cable and the power forward who manages to keep focus despite five criminal indictments.
Love that spin.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS REPORT: To Beat the Market, Hire a Philosopher;
Bill Miller Rethinks Value, and Keeps Thumping the S. & P.

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

DATELINE: BALTIMORE

 BODY:
PERHAPS it is the references to the fiction of Jorge Luis Borges, the late Argentine author whose metaphysical imagery he uses to illustrate a point about price-to-earnings ratios. Or maybe it is the nods to the philosophy of William James, whose theories are called upon to justify why America Online is a value stock. Certainly some hint is in the "thought experiments" that he calls upon his staff to perform.
Spend even a few minutes talking with William H. Miller 3d and it becomes clear that he is not a typical mutual fund manager. 
 The performance of his fund speaks to that. In each of the last eight years, the $6 billion Legg Mason Value Trust has outperformed the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. Since the beginning of the 90's, shareholders of the fund have seen their investment grow by 453 percent, or 20.9 percent a year, on average -- well ahead of the 17.8 percent annual return of the S.& P.
None of the thousands of other mutual fund managers currently plying the trade has equaled that feat; barely 1 in 10, in fact, have beaten the benchmark over the last three years. Anyone else aspiring to the mantle of fund manager of the decade should note that not even Peter Lynch, the legendary former overseer of the Fidelity Magellan fund, ever strung together such a consistent record.
Yet almost nothing that Mr. Miller does would seem to fit within the traditional parameters of the religion he claims to practice: "value investing," the method of buying assets for a small portion of their true worth whose best-known evangelist is Warren E. Buffett.
By contrast, Mr. Miller, 48, oversees a portfolio whose two largest holdings are Dell Computer and America Online, stocks whose market values have been hyperinflated by the craze for anything to do with the Internet. Such stocks are all but shunned by strict value types.
That those two stocks account for more than three-quarters of the gains in the Legg Mason Value Trust over the last two and a half years only adds to the skepticism of people who doubt that Mr. Miller is anything more than a crowd-follower. Without those investments, Mr. Miller might be just another value fund manager, struggling to keep up with a runaway bull market.
At the least, the holdings raise questions for current and prospective investors in his fund -- including whether he can realize profits without causing huge tax burdens for fund shareholders.
Soft-spoken and unflappable, Mr. Miller expresses confidence in both his methods and the results, steadfastly defending his style as holding to traditional value methods.
"Most people don't want to figure out what a company is worth," Mr. Miller said. "They want to know where the stock is going. We're always trying a Rubik's Cube approach, looking at something from all different directions. We want to know, 'What's the best description of what's going on?' "
It is an approach he honed in the mid-1970's at Johns Hopkins University as a graduate student -- not in business, but in philosophy.
Michael Hooker, a former philosophy professor at Johns Hopkins who is now chancellor of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, recalls his first impressions of Mr. Miller. "Every morning I was the first faculty member to get to work," Mr. Hooker said. "And when I would arrive, Bill would be sitting in the faculty library reading The Wall Street Journal. It was odd."
Over months of talking to Mr. Miller about a dummy portfolio he was managing and hearing Mr. Miller's excited explanations of the theories of Mr. Buffett and Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing, Mr. Hooker began to discern in the student "an ability to connect the dots where other people don't even see the dots."
Mr. Hooker encouraged his protege to quit philosophy -- before earning the doctorate he had been studying for -- and to try his hand at finance.
The principles that have had the greatest influence on Mr. Miller are those of William James, the father of the school of philosophy known as pragmatism. James believed that the way one knows that an idea is true is if it is useful, and that knowledge can be rightly understood only in its context. To Mr. Miller, that means that the value of companies like America Online and Dell Computer must be considered in light of how technology is changing the ways in which companies do business and people communicate.
For example, technological advances that let companies better control their inventories have taken some of the big swings out of the economy -- and, as a result, out of the fortunes of historically cyclical companies, like makers of heavy equipment. Traditional value investors might be tempted to buy those relatively cheap, cyclical stocks, in anticipation of the next big upturn in the economy. Mr. Miller, however, thinks any such swings will be longer in coming and of smaller significance than history teaches.
By contrast, Dell serves companies capitalizing on this new economy -- and its own inventory controls are the envy of its industry.
"It is a lot like the change from an agrarian economy to an industrial economy," Mr. Miller said. "It didn't happen all at once; it happened very subtly, year after year, but the accumulated change was very large."
WHAT way of thinking also informed the discussion of America Online on a recent blustery December morning at the offices of Legg Mason, hard by Baltimore's Inner Harbor. The evening before, American Online had been selected as the newest addition to the S.& P. 500. Its stock was certain to open higher, as investors anticipated the surge of buy orders that would come from index funds that track the S.& P.
On that morning, Mr. Miller was meeting with his team of analysts and portfolio managers, who contribute to the Value Trust but who also manage four other funds, Legg Mason Special Investment Trust, Total Return Trust, American Leading Companies and Focus Trust. The topic was whether America Online's rising value should lead the fund to sell some of its shares.
The fund had bought the stock in late 1996, when a flood of new subscribers to America Online overwhelmed the capacity of the service's computers. Investors, fearing that subscribers would flee from the service, sent the shares down 50 percent from their high.
But Lisa Rapuano, an analyst on Mr. Miller's team, believed that Wall Street misunderstood the significance of America Online's problems. The higher demand meant customers loved the service, she figured -- that it was changing the way that millions of people gathered and shared information. She convinced Mr. Miller to buy a million shares for the Value Trust.
Now, two years later, America Online's shares were trading at about $138, about 15 times the $9 or so that Value Trust had paid. Based on Ms. Rapuano's models, which calculate the immediate value of the future cash flows of America Online's business, the stock was close to its full value.
But in the longer term, Ms. Rapuano said, America Online's potential remained great. "The company has a $60 billion market value," she said. "In our long-term model, this is potentially a gigantic company -- $200 billion to $300 billion over the next 10 years. Over the next 12 to 24 months, we shouldn't have quite so much in AOL, but that doesn't mean we don't want to have a large position over the 5-to-10 year horizon." The fund sold a few hundred thousand of its eight million shares that day.
In the roughly two years after Mr. Miller bought America Online and Dell Computer for the Value Trust, those stocks grew to account for 14 percent and 9 percent of the fund's assets, respectively. But even though the fund took in more than $3 billion in new cash from investors over that period -- by itself enough to triple the fund's size -- the fund has made no additions to those holdings. On balance, the fund has sold more than $100 million of those stocks since its first purchase.
Still, it is unusual for a fund called the Value Trust to be holding on to stock that trades for 600 times the company's earnings, as America Online does. The issue is not lost on Mr. Miller.
"There are a lot of value funds out there with good long-term records and not-so-good one- and five-year records," he said. But he said the Value Trust's superior performance this decade goes beyond Dell and America Online.
In the early 1990's, Mr. Miller invested a big portion of the fund in bank and financial stocks, which were depressed because of high interest rates and worries over loans to developing countries. Since then, financial stocks have been among the market leaders, and the fund still counts many of them among its holdings. In the mid-1990's, the Value Trust snapped up shares of health care companies when they were beaten down by concerns over President Clinton's health care plan.
"I'll easily trade no rate of return in the near term for higher confidence that a stock will outperform in the long term," he said.
There are plenty of examples of that philosophy in the Value Trust's portfolio. Consider Circus Circus, the casino stock that Mr. Miller bought in the first quarter of 1996 -- at the same time he bought Dell Computer. While Dell's shares have since increased 35-fold, Circus Circus has fallen from the mid-30's to $12. Mr. Miller has responded by gradually quadrupling his holdings of Circus Circus, to more than five million shares -- more than 5 percent of the company. And recently he has been adding shares of Mirage Resorts and MGM Grand as well.
"The stocks are flat, but the cash flows of gaming companies have been growing," he explained. With new construction slowing down in Las Vegas, Nev., Mr. Miller expects those companies' cash flows to soar.
Low-priced assets, high cash flow, a business turnaround -- all traditional value-investing approaches, Mr. Miller points out.
How to detect the signs of change that will lead to big turnarounds in a company's market value is the subject of an exercise occasionally used by Mr. Miller for his team of analysts and portfolio managers. He calls the drills "thought experiments."
In a recent example, Mr. Miller -- drawing on the work of Douglas North, the 1993 Nobel laureate in economics -- asked the group to think of two continents with the same climate, land mass, indigenous populations and natural resource base that were settled at about the same time. Then, he asked them to figure out why one had created enormous wealth and the other had not.
LIKE many experiments in a science lab, the "answer" lies as much in the process as in the results. The continents, he explained to his team, are North and South America, and the application of traditional economic theory might lead one to conclude that, because the two continents started with equal assets, they should have been able to create equal levels of wealth.
But when viewed in the context of the ideas and institutions that guided the settlement and development of North and South America, Mr. Miller said, those assets have very different values -- and the outcomes, of course, have been far different, too.
What does any of that have to do with managing a mutual fund?
"It gives us a framework to think about things," said Jay Leopold, who follows health care and finance companies for Mr. Miller's team. "He doesn't cram philosophy down our throats. But he gets us to think about how the context of something affects the anticipated outcome."
Mr. Miller also draws on the work of the Santa Fe Institute, a research organization in New Mexico devoted to studying the science of complexity -- things like swarm behavior, the collective actions of groups of bees, ants, birds or portfolio managers.
Just as managers have swarmed to stocks with even a glancing connection to the Internet, so have traditional value investors fled from the high price-earnings ratios that those stocks carry.
"People look at price-earnings ratios like the Aleph," referring to the Borges short story by the same name. "The Aleph" is a mystical tale of a man who discovers in his cellar a point in space that contains all points in time, a center of infinite knowledge where, Borges writes, "without admixture or confusion, all of the places of the world, seen from every angle, coexist."
To perceive the P/E ratio as an Aleph, a be-all indicator of a company's value, Mr. Miller says, is a "pathetically simple view," one which would have led him to sell his most successful investments months ago. No simple ratio can tell everything that any investor -- value or otherwise -- needs to know about a stock.
One of the monumental tasks ahead of Mr. Miller is dealing with new investors, who likely believe that the fund's 40 percent annualized returns over the last four years should continue.
"The probabilities favor those returns being a lot lower in the future," he said. "Our record looks great right now," he added. "But I've had streaks that look really bad. We could have a streak that makes us look really mediocre."
In fact, he eschews summing up his legacy. "As William James would say, we can't really draw any final conclusions about anything."

HEADLINE: The World;
To Sicilians, Russia Has No Mafia. It's Too Wild.

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN 

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
In the old days, Russians traveling abroad were often and often rightly -- suspected of being K.G.B. agents. Now they are more likely to be suspected of belonging to something called the Russian mafia -- a nebulous term that has taken on real meaning in Budapest, Geneva, Brooklyn, Los Angeles and anywhere else where Russia's brazen criminal class has managed to set up branch offices.
But the term "mafia" -- an Italian word -- is something of a misnomer in Russia's freewheeling criminal world. That is one of the reasons why Sergei Mikhailov was recently set free by a court in Geneva after being exonerated, in a 10-day trial, of charges that he is the boss of the largest and most powerful gang in Russia today. 
 According to news accounts, the mountain of evidence presented against Mr. Mikhailov, 40, did little more than prove that he is, as he put it, "very, very rich," and that he has on occasion hung out with some very unpleasant people connected to Russian gang activity.
If he were an Italian being tried in Italy, he might well have been found guilty under a 1982 law that makes "mafia association" a criminal offense. With laws like these, Italy's war against organized crime has scored major victories in the last decade.
But for such a law to work against a Russian (assuming that it would ever be enforced), the first task would be to define the word "mafia." While in Italy the word signifies discreet criminal organizations with strict hierarchical structures, in Russia it has come to mean much more. Here it embraces the noxious blend of crime, politics and business that has engulfed Russia since the lifting of Communist controls.
"The problem is in the definition," said Pino Arlacchi, an expert on the Italian mafia and a former Italian senator who heads the United Nations' Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention. "When you go to court, you have to be able to define what the mafia is. In Italy, we discovered that there was a formal structure, with a very precise division of roles, and formal system for joining. In Russia you don't have that."
In Italy, purists argue that the word "Mafia" applies only to the Cosa Nostra, the tightly run Sicilian organization that has traditionally been the country's most powerful and brutal criminal group. In the 1980's, when hundreds of Sicilian mafiosi were put on trial and convicted, the Cosa Nostra's dominant Corleone clan lashed out with a campaign of terror that culminated in the assassination in 1992 of Giovanni Falcone, Sicily's top prosecutor. Today all but one of the top leaders of the Cosa Nostra -- members of its "cupola" or board of directors -- are in prison.
Of Italy's other regional crime groups, the Camorra in Naples is the most anarchic, a loose band of gangs whose penetration into local society has been more difficult to root out. According to Mr. Arlaachi, Russian organized crime is closer in kind to the Neapolitan version, although even in Naples, he conceded, the Neapolitans abide by rules that the Russians routinely ignore.
In Mr. Arlaachi's view, only 10 to 20 percent of Russian crime can be attributed to organized crime, in the mafia sense of the word. "Most of these groups have proliferated very quickly, taking advantage of the weakening of the state," he said. "They are not concerned about a high level of organization. They are too busy exploiting the opportunities they have in front of them. They use violence in ways that to a Sicilian mafioso would be inconceivable."
According to Russians and foreigners who do business here, the collusion between criminals and bureaucrats, between gunrunners and bankers, between policemen and thieves is so widespread and runs so deep that untangling the links is now virtually impossible, not to mention dangerous.
The intermingling of legal and illegal business dates back to the late 1980's, when cooperatives were first allowed to creep through the cracks in the state-controlled economy, before a legal framework was ready to promote and protect private enterprise. Rackets soon sprang up in the cooperatives' shadow, offering both protection and a method of settling disputes.
AS business became more sophisticated, criminal gangs followed suit. By the early 1990's, small businesses whose bank accounts had grown to critical levels were likely to get a visit by men who, tipped off by their agents inside the banking system, would offer their protective services in return for a share of profit, or alternatively a loan on terms that were hard to refuse.
By its very essence, the Russian version of the mafia defies the Italian definition of a secret society, which until recently protected itself by a wall of silence. Here there is no oath of silence, or "omerta," as the Sicilians call it. Instead, crime groups have an open-door policy that over the last 10 years has been wide enough to let in a large swath of society, willingly and unwillingly, from policemen to bankers, from politicians to industrialists.
The Russian criminal world has come a long way from the now-legendary days of the "thieves in law," a peculiar term given to criminals who during their long stints in Soviet prisons were crowned by their peers as the ultimate arbiters of criminal disputes. Such men still exist but their authority has been undermined by a de facto legitimization of crime that started with run-of-the-mill racketeering, gambling and prostitution, and gradually climbed up through the ranks of government.
Take the case of Mr. Mikhailov, who 15 years ago was a waiter at a Moscow hotel. Sent to prison in 1984 for insurance fraud (he stole his own motorcycle), he made the contacts that, according to police and press reports, were to lay the groundwork for the rest of his career.
AFTER prison, he set up a local sports organization and was allowed to travel abroad in 1986, despite Soviet-era controls barring most Russians from leaving the country. He was arrested twice again -- once for racketeering, another time for the murder of a casino owner -- but was not convicted.
At the time of his arrest in Switzerland in 1996, Mr. Mikhailov was an international operator with an empire that was said to include a hotel in Budapest, a banana-exporting business in Costa Rica and interests in Israel, Belgium and across the former Soviet Union. Witnesses at the trial testified that his arrest broke up negotiations on two contracts totaling $350 million, one involving the laying of a new sewage system in Moscow, the other the construction of a gas pipeline from Turkmenistan.
So how did a former waiter become a multi-billionaire, with a home in Switzerland, a Costa Rican diplomatic passport, and the kind of insider political contacts that can make or break a business in Russia?
On his arrival in Moscow before a bank of television cameras, Mr. Mikhailov had an answer. Flashing a V-for-victory sign, he told reporters that his exoneration by the Swiss was proof not only that "Russians are not necessarily criminals," but that "they can be businessmen who contribute to the development of the economy of Russia."

Crime in the State Falls To a 33-Year Low

BYLINE: By KIRSTY SUCATO 

 BODY:
Crime fell by 10 percent in the first half of 1998, to the lowest levels since the State Police began compiling figures in 1966. The reductions outpaced the 5 percent drop in crime nationally and the 8 percent drop in the Northeast over the same period, figures that the Federal Bureau of Investigation reported in December.
The state report, released last week by the State Police from information submitted by local, county and state police, found that violent crime fell by 12 percent between January and June to the lowest levels since 1979. Murder dropped by 2 percent from the same period in 1997, from 158 to 155. Rape declined by 14 percent, and aggravated assault dropped by 13 percent. 
 Nonviolent crime was down 10 percent, with robberies decreasing 11 percent and larceny by 8 percent. Arson, domestic violence and bias incidents, fell by 19 percent, 3 percent and 12 percent respectively. Experts on crime said the reductions can be attributed to higher rates of imprisonment, a strong economy and fewer people between the ages of 18 and 24. KIRSTY SUCATO

HEADLINE: The Nation: Fixing Medicare;
Light at a Tunnel's End

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
A TENSE exchange last week between two liberal members of the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare moved the group toward a dramatic agreement. The members agreed to develop a plan to radically revamp Medicare by giving its beneficiaries a fixed sum of money to buy private or public insurance. In short, the use of vouchers -- something liberals have shunned in education -- might be good for Medicare.
Bruce C. Vladeck, a former administrator of Medicare, who is a staunch defender of the basic fee-for-service plan, began the debate by proposing that Medicare officials get stronger powers to restrict some medical practices, to negotiate fees and to favor participation by some physicians over others. A dissenting member, Stuart H. Altman, a Brandeis University professor, argued that Mr. Vladeck's proposals might result in excessive Governmental control. He could support them only if Medicare moved to a system of competing public and private health plans that would give the beneficiaries attractive ways to opt out of the traditional Government program. . 
 Mr. Vladeck eventually chose Mr. Altman's competitive model, which put him in temporary alliance with at least 10 other commissioners; 11 votes from among the commission's 17 members are needed to forward a recommendation to Congress.
But the consensus may be more illusory than real. Much more has to be agreed on before Mr. Vladeck, Mr. Altman and other Democratic appointees will agree on a voucher plan to send to Congress.
Medicare, primarily a fee-for-service health plan serving about 40 million elderly, pays nearly any bill submitted by any doctor on behalf of any enrollee. There is little supervision of physician care. The system excludes prescription drugs and other benefits routinely provided by private insurance plans but does not hold down costs. As the baby boomers begin to retire, Medicare costs are expected to soar to about 5 percent of aggregate income by 2020 from about 2.5 percent today
Aiming to change all that are eight Republican appointees of the advisory commission along with its chairman, Senator John Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, and Senator Bob Kerrey, Democrat of Nebraska. They envision Medicare as a health care system similar to the one covering Federal employees, who can choose from many insurance plans. Under one version, the beneficiaries would in effect receive a voucher enabling them to enroll in either the traditional Government plan or in a private managed-care plan. Each plan would offer an identical package of core benefits.
The tricky step is assigning a dollar value to the voucher. Many economists favor plans setting their own premiums. Then the Government would pay a certain amount, say, 75 percent of the cost of the average plan. The beneficiaries would pay the remaining 25 percent, receiving rebates if they chose inexpensive plans. Under some versions, the Government would provide subsidies for low-income families.
This voucher system -- which proponents call premium support -- is designed to encourage innovation and to pressure plans to keep their premiums low. Proponents point out that this plan exposes the beneficiaries to little risk because it ties the dollar value of the voucher to the premiums that health plans actually charge in the market. That way, the voucher will not fall below the amount that families need to buy the Government-mandated benefits.
Mr. Vladeck and some of the other Democratic appointees disagree. They are skeptical that private plans will be affordable to moderate income families or that the Government can adequately supervise the market.
Deborah Steelman, a Republican appointee, says that the commission will have to save enough money to cover the future deficit in the current program and save more money to pay for any new benefits that the commission adds. Democratic appointees worry that the savings cannot be achieved without depriving the beneficiaries.
The Republicans have so far refused to consider raising taxes to pay for any new benefits. Ms. Steelman cites the ugly backlash in 1989 after Congress taxed every beneficiary in order to add benefits that many elderly already received from their former employers. The uproar forced Congress to repeal the new benefits.
BUT the Democrats say the only way to make adequate health benefits universal is to make them mandatory. Mr. Vladeck and Mr. Altman are unlikely to approve a voucher plan that lacks sufficient revenues for drugs and other essentials and fails to cover low-income families. They lean toward raising taxes.
There are many other potential sources of dispute. Should the commission close some of the future deficit by raising the age of eligibility? And how will it encourage private plans to cater to AIDS patients and others requiring expensive care? So what seemed like an easy consensus last week could quickly break down. The commission may wind up agreeing only to small-bore fixes that would keep the program solvent for a few more years. And even if it does propose a radical overhaul, Congress might not go along.
Yet something of potential importance occurred last week. Mr. Vladeck and other defenders of the current system know they cannot make traditional Medicare work well unless Congress gives it the power so long withheld. But, Mr. Altman says, the road to the best fee-for-service plan possible runs right through the voucher system.

HEADLINE: Allies Are Cool To French Plan To Monitor Iraq

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, Jan. 9

 BODY:
France and Britain conferred this week on the next steps to take in Iraq, but French officials said on Friday that wide differences still separated them.
France would like Britain and the United States to agree in the United Nations Security Council to lift the oil embargo against Iraq if President Saddam Hussein consents to a new system of international arms monitoring. The French proposal has met with little success with the allies so far and, as a high-ranking French official said on Friday, there is not yet any certainty that Mr. Hussein will agree to a permanent control system. 
 Russia and China, also permanent members of the Security Council, would have to approve as well.
The United States and Britain bombed Iraq last month after Baghdad stopped cooperating with United Nations arms inspectors who the Iraqis said were spies for the United States. Washington has since acknowledged getting information for the bomb strikes from equipment the inspection teams used.
Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine of France discussed Iraq here over breakfast on Friday with Britain's Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, but they made no statement afterward.
"The British and the Americans at this point are insisting that Iraq will be subject to continued bombing unless it agrees again to inspections by United Nations Special Commission teams," a French official said, referring to the arms inspectors.
"We believe Iraq no longer has any nuclear capability, and large quantities of chemical and biological stocks, we know, have been found and destroyed by the United Nations teams," the official said. "We do not believe there is any point in going back in and continuing to look for the last test tube, because we'll never find it. What we need is a new system of continuous monitoring that allows us to make sure Iraq does not try to build new facilities to acquire these things again."
In the French view, such a system would include both television cameras and expert inspections to keep an eye on suspected sites. But the French say the United Nations Special Commission, which has been led by an Australian diplomat, Richard Butler, will never again be acceptable to Iraq.
As an incentive to get Iraq to permit a new inspection system, French officials said, the United Nations would lift the remaining embargo against Iraqi oil exports but set up controls to make sure President Hussein did not spend any of the revenues on new weapons.
At this point, according to French officials, the United States is unwilling to consider such ideas.

HEADLINE: Extortion Cases Expose Mob Ties to Minority-Hiring Groups

BYLINE: By SELWYN RAAB 

 BODY:
For three decades, construction companies in New York City have been bedeviled by groups claiming to represent minority workers battling racial bias in the billion-dollar industry. The groups, dubbing themselves "community coalitions," have often staged stormy protests that forced contractors to offer them jobs in return for labor peace.
But last month, the convictions of six coalition leaders in two separate extortion cases exposed a new aspect of some of the groups: secret deals between three rogue coalitions and the Mafia to extract payoffs from contractors. 
 In one case, William Marshall, a Mafia defector, testified that the Gambino crime family and two major coalitions joined forces to shake down contractors in the mid-1990's. The mobsters, he explained, encouraged coalition leaders to stage disruptions at construction sites. Gambino family members then stepped in, Mr. Marshall said, promising the contractors that they had the muscle to end harassment.
The mobsters and the coalition chiefs got thousands of dollars in payoffs from each collaboration, according to testimony by Mr. Marshall and several contractors who were Government witnesses.
Although they were paying both sides, Mr. Marshall said, the contractors apparently did not know that the coalition leaders and mobsters were allies.
The Gambino family, Mr. Marshall said, took protection money for supposedly helping the contractors reduce demands by coalitions. And prosecutors charged that coalition bosses, in exchange for canceling protests, were given no-show jobs as "community coordinators" that paid up to $900 a week. Prosecutors asserted that the coalition leaders did little to find jobs for black and Hispanic workers. Lawyers for those leaders, however, insisted that they had found jobs for many minority workers.
Mr. Marshall claimed, without citing proof, that two other Mafia factions in the New York area, the Genovese and Lucchese families, obtained similar payoffs by using minority coalitions "to stir up trouble" with contractors.
That case, tried in Federal District Court in Manhattan, also provided a partial preview of testimony about construction rackets that may be offered later this year against John A. Gotti, 34, who is accused of being the acting boss of the Gambino family. Mr. Marshall said that Mr. Gotti, the son of the imprisoned Gambino boss, John J. Gotti, got a $50,000 protection payoff in 1995 from a company that was being extorted simultaneously by a coalition.
"A decision that every contractor in New York City has to make is whether or not to seek protection by employing people from the coalitions," said Joel M. Aurnow, the acting president of the DeFoe Construction Company, whose officials acknowledged at a trial and in interviews that the company hired representatives of coalitions and employed a reputed Gambino mobster to deal with the groups.
"You can't arm your employees, and you can't rely on the police to provide all the protection you need," Mr. Aurnow said in an interview.
Mr. Aurnow and other contractors said that the coalition disruptions occurred mainly at construction sites in the city and rarely in the suburbs or upstate. But six construction companies involved in the two cases denied paying mobsters for protection.
On Dec. 16, a Federal jury in Manhattan convicted four coalition leaders on charges of extortion conspiracy: Trevor Johnson, 58, whom prosecutors described as the leader of Brooklyn Fight Back; two of his top aides, Robert Carnes, 29, and Daniel Hunter, 27, and Dennis McCall, 33, of the United Construction Labor Coalitions.
Prosecutors charged that the two groups had worked in concert and with mobsters on extortion plots.
Payroll records and testimony revealed that Mr. Johnson was paid $800 to $900 a week for almost a decade by the Tully Construction Company of Flushing, Queens; Mr. McCall was paid $140,000 in recent years by the HHM Construction Company of Maspeth, Queens; Mr. Carnes was paid $65,000 from 1995 to 1997 by the DeFoe Company of Mount Vernon, and Mr. Hunter was paid $4,500 in 1997 by the Sullivan and McGrath Construction Company of Amityville, N.Y.
In a related case in Federal District Court in White Plains, on the same day as the guilty verdicts in Manhattan, Michael Sims, 32, and James T. Sims, 28, who together ran the Black and Latin Economic Survival Coalitions, known as BLES, pleaded guilty to extorting an unspecified amount of money from a company that had a $25 million state contract for repairs on the Grand Central Parkway in Queens.
Investigators said they obtained evidence against Michael and James Sims, who are stepbrothers, after they were heard on court-authorized telephone taps discussing deals with Gambino mobsters. No testimony was presented at hearings when the Sims brothers pleaded guilty, and prosecutors declined to give further details of the evidence.
The six defendants in the two cases had jobs as community coordinators or were seeking them from contractors. Each defendant faces up to 20 years in prison and a fine of $250,000 when sentenced.
None of the defendants in Manhattan testified. Through cross-examinations of Government witnesses and in summations, defense lawyers argued that their clients legally earned their salaries from construction companies by resolving disputes among rival coalitions and by obtaining jobs for black and Hispanic construction workers in an industry they described as entrenched in racism.
The lawyers contended that the defendants were recruited for help in publicly financed projects that require companies to include minority employees on their work force. Stephen P. Scaring, a defense lawyer, maintained in closing arguments that mobsters, not the coalitions, extorted payoffs only for themselves and that the Mafia had no influence on the labor organizations.
Law enforcement and government officials say that since the 1960's, legitimate and questionable coalitions have sprung up in the city, advocating greater employment of minority construction workers.
James F. McNamara, who helped draft city and state regulations on the hiring of minority workers for public construction jobs, said that about a dozen loosely organized coalitions exist in the city.
"The leaders of most of these groups are out to feather their own nests and do very little to increase job opportunities for minorities," said Mr. McNamara, a former consultant to law enforcement agencies on labor racketeering.
But he cited two long-established coalitions, Harlem Fight Back, which is not affiliated with Brooklyn Fight Back, and the Chinese Construction Workers Association for unblemished records in helping minority workers.
Jim Haughton, the director of Harlem Fight Back, said the "teaming up of these convicted coalition people with organized crime has discredited legitimate efforts to bring about fair play for blacks, Latinos and Asians in this industry."
But, he said, contractors created much of the problem by inventing the position of community coordinator. "The real criminals," Mr. Haughton said, "are contractors who pay off phony coordinators even if they have to use strong-arm methods to keep legitimate folks away from construction sites and to undermine our efforts against racism in the industry."
For more than 50 years, criminal and civil cases have shown that five Mafia families based in the New York area have engaged in construction corruption, mainly through influence in labor unions. Before the recent extortion cases, the authorities suspected that the Mafia cooperated with several coalitions but found no substantial evidence.
Federal and state investigators say they had been hampered in uncovering shakedowns by spurious coalitions primarily because contractors and their employees feared retaliation if they cooperated with law enforcement agencies.
But an investigation by state and Federal agencies that began in 1995 with a look at Gambino family gambling and loan sharking rings uncovered evidence involving Brooklyn Fight Back, the United Coalitions and BLES. In telephone taps and bugs on Gambino members, investigators heard about meetings and alliances being arranged with coalitions.
Those leads helped implicate the three coalitions and allowed investigators to track down the construction companies that were being victimized.
At the Manhattan trial, Mr. Marshall admitted that in the early 1990's, he became an associate, or worker, for a Gambino crew in Westchester County that prosecutors say was run by Gregory DePalma, an acting capo, or captain.
Mr. Marshall, 33, a ruggedly built man who is a former Westchester County jail guard, said that in 1996 he accompanied Mr. DePalma, 66, his son, Craig DePalma, 32, whom prosecutors have identified as a Gambino soldier, and other Gambino mobsters to three or four meetings with Mr. Johnson and members of his coalition at the Baychester Diner in the northeast Bronx. The purpose of the meetings, he said, was to discuss payoffs from the DeFoe Company.
Last year, after being indicted with John A. Gotti and both DePalmas in a broad Federal racketeering case, Mr. Marshall pleaded guilty and agreed to testify for the Government in return for a reduced sentence. He is now in the Federal Witness Protection Program, awaiting sentencing.
Sarita Kedia, a lawyer for the younger Mr. Gotti, characterized Mr. Marshall as a perjurer. "Marshall did not have any direct relations with Gotti," Ms. Kedia said. "His testimony is unreliable and cannot be believed."
In final arguments at the Manhattan trial, Mylan L. Denerstein and Mark A. Godsey, the Federal prosecutors in charge of the case, maintained that the term "community coordinator" was a construction industry code word for extortion.
"The coalitions have created an environment where a contractor can't do business in New York City without paying for protection," Mr. Godsey added.

HEADLINE: Cuba Attacks as 'Deceptive' Clinton's Easing of Embargo

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: HAVANA, Jan. 9

 BODY:
A high-ranking Cuban official has denounced President Clinton's proposals to ease some restrictions in the United States' embargo of this Communist-run island, calling them a "deceptive maneuver" intended to deflect growing opposition around the world to the embargo.
The official, Ricardo Alarcon, the legislative leader who is Fidel Castro's point man on negotiations with the United States, said the changeswere also meant to hide Mr. Clinton's rejection of a bipartisan commission to review the wisdom of the 37-year-old embargo. Two former Republican Secretaries of State are among those who have backed the proposal to set up a commission. 
 "The whole world thought at least this commission would be created," Mr. Alarcon said in a two-hour address on state-run television late Friday night. His remarks were widely publicized here as Cuba's official response to Washington's overtures.
On Tuesday, Mr. Clinton announced a package of moves intended to spur private enterprise in Cuba without helping Mr. Castro's Government. They included expanding direct charter flights to the island, allowing more Americans to send cash remittances to Cuba, establishing direct mail service and sanctioning sales of food and agricultural supplies to charities and privately held farms.
While the Administration has said the measures represent a significant easing of the sanctions, Cuban officials have characterized them as unimportant tinkering that does nothing to alter the embargo.
The new proposals came on top of a similar raft of minor changes announced last March, when the Clinton Administration said for the first time it would allow direct flights to Cuba and legalized cash transfers of up to $1,200 a year that Cuban-Americans could send to their relatives on the island. The Administration also said it would allow American companies to sell medicines to Mr. Castro's Government on a case-by-case basis.
American officials have said the new policy is aimed at finding ways to help individual Cubans and charities, and to encourage private enterprise, without letting up pressure on Mr. Castro's Government.
In his rambling address, Mr. Alarcon presented a detailed chronology of the events since March, arguing that Washington had failed to live up to its promises to allow sales of medicine. He also pointed out that the direct flights to Cuba and legalized remittances had in practice changed nothing at all. Cuban-Americans had been sending money home through illegal channels in any case and were always able to travel to Cuba through other countries.
Mr. Alarcon also suggested that the new proposal to let Americans other than family members send money to Cubans had a sinister purpose. Noting that Cuban-Americans in Miami had financed terrorist groups that have, among other things, bombed hotels in Havana, Mr. Alarcon suggested the new rules would let right-wing extremists in Miami funnel more money to would-be counterrevolutionaries so that they could "look for ways to manufacture traitors."
"This is not the natural and normal help given within a family, but has an end clearly subversive and counterrevolutionary," he said.
Mr. Alarcon added that Cuban-Americans were the only immigrants in the United States who were not allowed to send whatever amount of money they liked to their relatives. He called the policy discriminatory and repressive. He also played down the importance of Washington's proposal to let charter flights leave the United States from cities other than Miami, saying that Mr. Clinton had said as much in March but that the changes had never been carried out.
Much of Mr. Alarcon's speech was devoted to listing a number of liberal legislators and advocacy groups in the United States that have protested against the embargo in recent months. He also highlighted the fact that the United Nations General Assembly has voted overwhelmingly for seven years to ask the United States to drop the policy.
On the question of direct mail between the two countries, Mr. Alarcon said there was a risk that militant anti-Castro factions in the United States would try to use the service to send letter bombs.
"One of the fundamental questions I would ask the U.S.," he said, "is, 'What are you going to do with your terrorists? How are you going to guarantee nobody here is going to suffer?' "
Winding up his talk, Mr. Alarcon urged Cubans to confront this "new attempt of aggression, this new attempt to attack us."
"It is an attack on an ideological plane, a political plane, without giving in reality anything, trying to confuse and trick you," he said. "I'm sure all of our people sincerely are going to reject this new face of the war against Cuba. They are going to continue forward with the same patriotic spirit."
Then he predicted the White House would eventually succumb to pressure from liberal groups within the United States and from other countries on the question of the embargo.
"Despite this deceptive maneuver, they know that this blockade, this criminal policy, they are going to have to abandon it, they are going to have to change it," he said. "Someday they will have to abandon it because they won't be able to sustain it in front of the growing opposition of the world."

HEADLINE: Politically Weak at Home, Turks Flex Muscles Abroad

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER 

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, Turkey, Jan. 9

 BODY:
Turkey may soon have a functioning Government after six weeks without one, but its new-found assertiveness in foreign policy is likely to continue no matter who emerges as the next Prime Minister.
Once a bashful actor on the world stage, Turkey has begun flexing its muscles whenever it feels the need. 
 Through blunt warnings of economic pressure and even military strikes, Turkish leaders are using their growing power as masters of the 18th-largest economy to achieve what they consider vital policy goals.
Benefiting in part from the new weakness of Russia, Iran and Iraq and regional rivals once backed by Soviet power, the Turks have achieved surprisingly good results.
This success is all the more remarkable in light of the country's deep political problems.
Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz, faced with allegations of corruption, lost a confidence vote in Parliament on Nov. 25.
He has been serving as a caretaker during weeks of political maneuvering that may finally produce a Government by Friday, led by a veteran, the former Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit.
Although Turkey has not had a stable Government since the 1995 election, Turkish foreign policy has become tougher and more forceful than ever.
Its most recent success came on the tense island of Cyprus, which is divided between Turkish and Greek sectors: The Greek-backed Cypriot Government had planned to deploy Russian antiaircraft missiles; Turkey responded by promising to bomb them. Last week, the Cypriots backed down.
Turkey cannot claim full credit for staring down the Cypriots, because the United States and several European countries had also urged that the deployment be canceled to avoid dangerous friction between two NATO members.
But in other areas, Turkish leaders have won important battles on their own.
In October Turkish generals and political leaders demanded that Syria expel a Kurdish rebel leader, Abdullah Ocalan, who has directed a 14-year guerrilla war in southeastern Turkey. They strongly hinted that Turkey would attack Syria if it did not comply, and massed soldiers along the Syrian border.
With an alacrity that some in the region found astonishing, Syria quickly knuckled under and expelled Mr. Ocalan.
Syria "couldn't have resisted an attack by Turkey and it didn't want to be humiliated, especially with Israel watching," said a European diplomat with long experience in the Middle East.
From Syria Mr. Ocalan flew to Russia. Turkish officials warned Russia that if he was allowed to stay there, they would demand instant repayment of Russian debts and force the scores of Turkish companies operating in Russia to cease operations immediately. Within days, Mr. Ocalan was in the air again, this time headed to Italy.
Turkish leaders demanded that Italy send him home to face trial. But Italy, which is governed by a left-leaning coalition that includes some who sympathize with Kurdish rebels, proved less pliant and refused.
Outraged Turks have threatened to ban Italian imports, which are worth many millions of dollars to Italian companies, and to reject Italian bids for huge Turkish military contracts. Newspapers here predict that Italy will soon see the error of its ways and send Mr. Ocalan away.
Turkey is also using high-pressure tactics to persuade foreign oil companies that they should build their main export pipeline for Caspian crude oil through Turkey. The companies want to build a shorter and cheaper pipeline to Georgia, then ship the crude in tankers across the Black Sea and through the Bosporus, the narrow strait that bisects Istanbul.
But Foreign Minister Ismail Cem replied that the Bosporus is already full and that Turkey will no longer "grant any priority to oil tankers."
Then the Turks told the two main partners in the Caspian oil consortium, Amoco and British Petroleum, that if they continue to support the Georgia route, Turkey will revoke their permits to explore for oil in Turkish waters. Turkish officials also said they would disqualify Amoco's bid to build a new $500 million liquid natural gas terminal.
Despite its debilitated political system, Turkey has a strong economy, a population of 65 million and 370,000 soldiers under arms, more than any other NATO country except the United States. Partly due to its old alliance with the United States and its new partnership with Israel, its military is well trained, disciplined and equipped.
"Even as recently as 1990, the Turkish state was largely Third World militarily and economically," said Alan Makovsky, a specialist in Turkish affairs at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.
Now, Mr. Makovsky said, "When they threaten economic or even military retaliation,it's not something that's easy to dismiss."

HEADLINE: Leon M. Goldstein Dies at 66; Led a City University College

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
Leon M. Goldstein, the gentle, genial, politically savvy president of Kingsborough Community College of the City University of New York and a leading candidate for New York City schools chancellor in 1995, died in his sleep Friday night at his home in Manhattan, a CUNY spokesman said. He was 66.
The spokesman said he did not know the cause of death. 
 Mr. Goldstein's skill in building a political base for Kingsborough in New York City and beyond and his willingness to seek efficiency for CUNY at a time of economic belt-tightening, brought him to the attention of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
In 1995, the Mayor endorsed him as his candidate for Schools Chancellor, and over the opposition of the board president, Carol A. Gresser, put together a majority of the school board to support him. But in the face of questions about whether he had dispensed political patronage and about his willingness to be forthcoming about his own resume, Mr. Goldstein withdrew his candidacy.
He was later cleared of the patronage charges by the Brooklyn District Attorney's office. A separate CUNY investigation cleared him of wrongdoing, except for one "minor" transgression in which he used college stationery to support a Brighton Beach real estate development.
In an interview last year, he said he was disappointed that he was forced to withdraw because of the charges. "My time would have been spent responding to the allegations."
But, he said, his time at Kingsborough had been productive.
Just last month, Mr. Goldstein sent CUNY a letter saying he planned to retire as president of Kingsborough in September.
Born in Borough Park, Brooklyn, the son of immigrants from Poland, Mr. Goldstein stayed close to his roots. He attended two CUNY schools -- City College and Brooklyn College -- for his bachelor's and master's degrees, and was involved in CUNY's administration, as Dean for Community Colleges and as Deputy Chancellor and Acting Chancellor between 1981 and 1983.
Amid budget cutbacks in 1992, Mr. Goldstein took on the unenviable task of leading a committee of CUNY presidents and faculty in recommending ways to improve academic planning. The resulting report, which called for colleges to cut programs that duplicated those on other CUNY campuses, drew a hail of protest from faculty members and other CUNY officials. Although most of the report's specific suggestions were not adopted, campuses like Baruch embraced some of its principles.
Mr. Goldstein's strong administrative skills and his wide political connections made him a natural choice as a possible candidate for other offices. But his primary career was at Kingsborough, which he built from a tiny college parked in a collection of merchant marine barracks into an innovative and successful institution housed in a sparkling complex on 72 acres nestled between Jamaica and Sheepshead Bays.
"He was the Robert Moses of CUNY," said Jay Hershenson, CUNY's vice chancellor for university relations.
Kingsborough offered the usual programs in liberal arts, nursing, secretarial skills and business, but it also offered a program in marine technology, replete with a former Coast Guard cutter outfitted to conduct research and an aquarium with small sharks and other fish.
Mr. Goldstein also developed programs for a wide range of students, from 5- and 6-year-olds who attended a special summer program to teen-agers who attended the college's High School for the Sciences to a core of about 800 elderly students who took tuition-free classes. His "College Now" program, which offered college preparatory classes to high school seniors who could not pass CUNY's placement tests, is now taught in 25 high schools and is being expanded throughout the CUNY system with backing from Albany.
Mr. Goldstein drew support and financing for Kingsborough through his active involvement in Brooklyn political and educational circles. He was close to Brooklyn Borough President Howard Golden and to William C. Thompson Jr., the former deputy borough president and now president of the school board.
In the last year, even as he defended the need for remedial classes for students, Mr. Goldstein would not criticize Mayor Giuliani for his denunciations of CUNY and its remedial programs. The Mayor will speak at Mr. Goldstein's funeral this afternoon, his office said.
Mr. Goldstein is survived by his wife, Mary De Piano Rothlein; a son, Michael, of New York City; a daughter, Lisa Miller of Mahwah, N.J., and two sisters, Toby Alden of Brooklyn and Marilyn Alsofrom of Royal Palm, Fla.

HEADLINE: A LEAGUE LOSES ITS GLOW: A special report.;
N.B.A., Once a Dream Team, Is Torn by Fight for Control

BYLINE: By MIKE WISE with SELENA ROBERTS; Richard Sandomir and Chris Broussard also contributed reporting to this article.

 BODY:
During the National Basketball Association's long labor dispute, Steve Jacobs of Timeout Magazine would listen in on news media conference calls as league officials gave their latest updates on negotiations. Brad Jones of Basketball Today listened in when the union and its players had their telephone talks with reporters.
There was only one catch: the names and affiliations were fakes, and the people listening in were actually spies for each side monitoring the other side's public posturing. 
 But the mutual exercise in suspicion and duplicity was, in fact, only one remarkable, if slightly comic, measure of how relations between the N.B.A.'s players and owners had deteriorated over the six months of the owners' lockout, a standoff that ended only last Wednesday with an 11th-hour deal that narrowly averted the first cancellation of an entire professional sports season.
The level of mistrust and animosity that colored the ugly fight over how to split $2 billion in annual revenues left many people, from fans to labor experts to marketing executives, deeply puzzled: how could the N.B.A., the league that fused pop culture, entertainment and sports into an enormously popular commercial product, allow itself to come apart so destructively?
But in truth, say players, agents and league officials, the nastiness of the contract battle was not all that surprising. The league and its players had for years harbored an expanding set of resentments: there were differences over the power of player agents and the enormous contracts they were extracting from owners; there was a hardening of feelings over player misconduct off the court; and players felt that however highly they were paid, the owners had abused them in past labor negotiations.
Keith Glass, an agent, said early last week: "The N.B.A. is no longer fantastic. The animosity that the players and owners feel for each other right now insures that. They probably haven't lost the fans as much as they've killed their own relationship. They'll never work together again like they once did. The residue of the last six months will be there for a long time."
And so, in the aftermath of last week's settlement, and with the start of an abbreviated season less than four weeks off, the league and its players have been left to calculate the lockout's damage -- to their own relationships and to the league's relationship with its fans.
"We prided ourselves on being the best," said Isiah Thomas, a former star for the Detroit Pistons, a past president of the players union, and once a part owner of the Toronto Raptors, who now is a television analyst for NBC. "That's what this league has been about. That's what they fell in love with. There was a family atmosphere, a real partnership. But then somewhere along the way, teams and players stopped policing themselves. It became a leaderless league. That's why we are where we are today."
"The level of ill will that these negotiations have produced will take a long time to heal," said David Falk, the agent for Michael Jordan and many of the league's biggest stars. "They've devalued their own product."
David Stern, the N.B.A. commissioner and lead negotiator for the owners, conceded shortly before the settlement that there was major repair work to be done.
"We enjoyed our relationship with the players; we understood the partnership," Stern said. "Somewhere along the way, I guess we've lost it."
How the two sides, once partners, became antagonists is a story that extends well back beyond the last six months of hard bargaining, angry rhetoric and public posturing.
The story involves the league's evolution from a troubled sports enterprise into a superstar-driven, relentlessly marketed entertainment product, one in which players, promoted by the league and signed to lucrative endorsement deals, came to have great individual power. It involves the changing roster of owners, a shift that saw family-owned teams taken over by maverick businessmen and giant corporations. It involves the signing of several calamitous contracts and a range of episodes, minor and major, in which players and owners each felt betrayed or powerless.
But players and agents and owners, however happy they are to be playing games again, recognize that the root causes of the dispute may not go away, and may, in fact, have been exacerbated by the lockout and the shared loss of hundreds of millions of dollars over the past six months.
 
Betrayal, Rollovers And a Hired Gun
 Two events in recent years did much to strain the sense of trust between players and owners, events that prompted the union to hire a tough leader for this latest set of negotiations and that poisoned the atmosphere of those negotiations.
One was the botched contract negotiation in 1995 when Simon Gourdine, the union's leader, who was himself a former league official, negotiated a deal with the owners that the players came to regard as so bad it was an act of betrayal. The other happened in 1991, when the players came to believe that the owners had in effect been hiding some of their income during discussions about sharing revenues with players.
"If you and I have a business, and I don't show you the paperwork, and I just tell you the money is where it should be, what would you say?" Dikembe Mutombo, a player on the union's negotiating committee, said in recalling the 1991 incident. "You don't show money, that's some deep stuff."
Even in subsequent years, with the players using the same accounting firm to check on owners' total earnings, many players believed that the owners had a way of concealing ancillary income that would not be included in the pot to be divided with the players. That suspicion was even deeper when the players, in the course of the latest negotiations, were told by the owners that many clubs were losing money.
"It took a number of months, maybe still even now, for the players to believe we weren't hiding money, and that the owners were losing money," one Eastern Conference team executive, speaking on condition of anonymity, said just before the settlement. "Most of the players who will vote still believe the owners are cooking the books, that the teams are not having the kind of losses that they have reported.
"The players have looked at our books and they don't believe our numbers. There's been an air of mistrust from the beginning regarding the numbers."
But while the dispute over hiding income generated mistrust, the contract negotiations in 1995 prompted outright fury. Then, Gourdine held secret negotiations with Stern on a new deal, and the proposal that came out included items that were anathema to the players and their agents, chiefly a luxury tax on contracts that free agents could sign to stay with their own team.
The players revolted, and certain agents led a movement to disband the union and then re-create it with different leadership. Ultimately, Gourdine was ousted, and a much more militant group of players, including Patrick Ewing and Alonzo Mourning, took positions of leadership in the union.
The union, determined to assume a far more aggressive and confrontational approach against owners they felt had both misled them and then all but tricked them in a contract negotiation, hired Billy Hunter as its executive director.
When they interviewed Hunter in a San Antonio hotel conference room in February 1996, few players on the executive committee knew much about him. They saw on his resume that he was a former United States Attorney and knew that he had played two years in the National Football League as a defensive back and kick returner.
He was a former player. He could relate, they thought. Yet with no experience as a labor negotiator and approaching his mid-50's, some skeptical players wanted to know what his objective would be when he sat across from the powerful commissioner at the bargaining table.
Hunter vowed that he would try to defeat Stern. "Just like he would try to do to me," Hunter said. "I'm not going to be intimidated, I can tell you that."
Hunter, in contrast to his predecessor, welcomed the assistance of prominent player agents, quickly forming an agents advisory committee. And Hunter was often at Madison Square Garden, working the locker rooms before the games, spending as much time as he could talking with players.
Asked often what the players' strategy would be in negotiations, Hunter would reply, "We're going to take back what they didn't give us in 1995." He would then conclude, "I'm relishing the opportunity."
 
Entertainment More Than Sport
 A savvy 22-year-old named Michael Jordan stood before a crowd of reporters in 1985 to announce that he had signed an endorsement deal with Coca-Cola. It was a time when the soft-drink company was tinkering with tradition by introducing New Coke.
And so the tricky question was asked: "Michael, do you prefer New Coke or regular Coke?" Jordan could either insult tradition or snub change. He did neither, and told the reporter: "Coke is Coke. Both taste great."
The ultimate pitchman was born. And from that moment on, Jordan, with his soft baritone voice and his spellbinding skills on the court, ignited a marketing phenomenon that would serve the N.B.A.'s strategy to sell its stars.
But in time, the very success of the league's marketing effort -- selling stars more than teams -- created an imbalance of power, with players able to demand huge salaries and dictate a club's financial strategy. It also backfired when advertisers, sponsors and fans came to realize that Jordan and his formidable marketability were the exception, not the rule.
After the league nearly collapsed during the 1970's and early 80's, ridden by drug use and by the perception that a predominantly black league could not sell tickets, Stern was determined to develop a marketing strategy behind the idea of multimedia stars. It started with Larry Bird and Magic Johnson -- two likable players who had ability to match their personality -- and was carried to a new level by Jordan, a crossover marketing phenomenon able to sign deals with McDonald's, Nike, Coca-Cola and Gatorade.
Jordan's popularity trickled down to the rest of the league. Suddenly, every team seemed to have a commercially identifiable face -- Shaquille O'Neal, for instance -- and players rose to something more closely approximating rock star status. The N.B.A. became a fixture in a global pop culture.
The 1992 Olympic Dream Team, festooned with Jordan, Bird and Johnson, was an international hit. The N.B.A. superstars in Barcelona, Spain, stopped to take pictures with opposing players and mugged with fans.
"The N.B.A. is much more of a celebrity-driven league than the N.F.L. or baseball or the N.H.L.," said Dean Bonham of the Bonham Group, a sports marketing firm. "The word celebrity is used because the N.B.A. is as much entertainment as it is sport. The N.B.A. has helped facilitate that exposure through corporations over the years and has helped foster the image of celebrity."
Not surprisingly, players, armed with wealth gained outside their contracts for playing basketball and positioned as the league's source of identity and appeal, brought enormous strength to the negotiating table when contract talks came up. Deals for $60 million, then $100 million resulted.
But two contract negotiations changed the economic landscape, and the mood of the league, more than any others: O'Neal's deal with the Los Angeles Lakers and Kevin Garnett's with the Minnesota Timberwolves.
The Orlando Magic never imagined it could go from the team of the next decade as an N.B.A. finalist in 1995 to a team that failed to make the playoffs last year. But that can happen to a team that cannot retain its franchise player.
As free agency approached in 1996, the Magic underestimated O'Neal's market value and insulted him with a $69 million offer. Rich DeVos, Orlando's owner, vowed he would not break the bank for O'Neal. The Lakers did, for $121 million. The Magic has not recovered since, and the leverage of a star player was made manifest.
Other owners took note. A year later, the new owner of the Timberwolves, Glen Taylor, watched as his youthful team began to take form. They were not yet championship material, but with Garnett, a second-year star, and the rookie Stephon Marbury, the potential of this previously slumping expansion franchise had the league buzzing. But when soon faced with losing Garnett, unproven and just 20 at the time, the Timberwolves signed him for $126 million.
"I think the Garnett deal certainly opened the eyes of a lot of owners," Tom Gugliotta, Garnett's Minnesota teammate, said recently. "If there was any doubt, that was probably the end of it. The owners felt the guys were abusing the system. Frankly, they probably were."
Things may change now.
One team executive said: "A reasonable person could believe that the league -- which has made a good deal of money out of marketing itself through the stars -- might not be so interested in doing that in the future. We've never marketed a team or league. We've spent a lot of time marketing our players as role models. It's not unreasonable to assume that there would be a change in that position now."
 
Newer, Bolder Team Owners
 "This lockout is about control," Karl Malone, the star forward for the Utah Jazz, said early in the negotiations last summer. "It's like the owners are saying, 'We're going to show you who's boss.' "
It used to be clear who was in charge. Owners used to be individuals with a love for the game, like Abe Pollin, who bought the Washington Wizards 34 years ago and is part of a vanishing breed of old-line owners.
"It was more personal in the past," said Buck Williams, a 17-year veteran in the league. "I remember Joe Taub when I was with the Nets. I think he has just a very small share of that team now," since it was sold to a consortium of real estate developers last summer, "but he was someone who was hands on and very personable. I could always call Joe up and he'd be open and honest and candid. You could just talk to the guy whenever something was on your mind. He was a throwback."
Rarely, if ever, has Charles Dolan, chairman of Cablevision, which owns the Knicks, stepped inside the locker room at Madison Square Garden. In what was more of a family atmosphere in the 60's and 70's, owners would invite players on vacations with them. Now there are players who have never met the owners of their teams.
Stern, then, had to represent a tougher, less sentimental collection of owners, owners who, if they admitted they might have made mistakes in signing some of the more outrageous contracts with players, were clearly weary of feeling pushed around. The owners -- Gordon Gund of Cleveland and Ross Perot Jr. of Dallas, for example -- were prepared to fight long and hard for reform of the league's economics and for regaining what they described as control of their teams.
For these owners had watched as Anfernee Hardaway in Orlando and Grant Hill in Detroit played roles in ousting their coaches in an exercise of power.
And the owners, if they were eager to assert greater control, were this year equipped to do so, for 14 months ago the league had signed four-year television deals that would bring them a combined $2.64 billion through the 2001-2 season -- more than double the value of their previous contracts. And the league, through a fortunate bit of dealing, was assured of being paid even in the event of a lockout.
"This is must-have TV," Harvey Schiller, president of Turner Sports, said at the time the deals were announced.
The lucrative deal made sense for NBC, and for TNT and TBS, the Turner stations. They shared nearly $400 million in profits with the league in the deals that ended last season and expected to split more in the new contracts.
So it was not surprising that their top executives hardly seemed pained at the prospect of paying this season's rights fees in full -- $465 million -- for a truncated or canceled season in exchange for NBC paying less in the next three seasons and Turner carrying more future games.
The hundreds of millions of guaranteed dollars, then, emboldened the owners and insulated them, at least in part, from catastrophic losses if a season were lost in an effort to extract the deal they wanted from the players.
"I think it's all about control," Falk, the agent many owners accused of holding teams hostage during contract negotiations, said near the end of the standoff. "I don't think this labor dispute is about economics. I think the owners are sick and tired of young and basically uneducated men, many of whom haven't finished college, in a position to demand large sums of money. But I see the frustration. And yet, at the same time, remember that Stern is the man who has been saying for the last 20 years that these are the 300 greatest athletes in the world."

HEADLINE: Rebellion in White: Doctors Pulling Out Of H.M.O. Systems

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
For Dr. Clement Barone, a radiologist on the Upper East Side, the final straw came when Blue Cross Blue Shield told him it was cutting reimbursements for mammograms to $42 each. (He charges $200.) He dropped the plan, and said he might stop accepting all managed care soon.
Dr. Barney Softness, a pediatrician on West End Avenue, said he decided that he could take no more when Oxford Health Plans suggested that he cut costs by getting rid of the registered nurses in his office. Instead, he told Oxford goodbye. 
 Dr. Byron Thomashow, a pulmonary specialist in Washington Heights, recalled how he had fought with one company for three hours to get permission to do a procedure on a woman who was coughing up life-threatening amounts of blood. He said the dispute underscored why he was no longer in a managed care plan.
While 92 percent of doctors in New York State accepted managed care last year, it seems that a small rebellion is on. Fed up with years of acrimonious relationships with managed care companies, doctors, particularly those serving upper-middle-class patients, are quietly starting to fight back.
Many are dropping plans that have the lowest reimbursement rates or biggest administrative headaches, or represent the fewest of their patients. Others are washing their hands of the carriers, forcing patients to pay up front and file claims the old-fashioned way, or pay the fees themselves.
Still others are looking for alternative ways to negotiate with the companies, like forming group practices or other professional associations that have more leverage to seek better reimbursement rates.
And hospitals are trying to fight back by asking the New York State Attorney General's office to look into managed-care company practices.
"There is no question that a growing number of doctors are disassociating themselves from managed care," said Dr. Charles Aswad, the executive vice president of the Medical Society of the State of New York. Still more, he said, "are being much more judicious about looking at managed care contracts."
While it is too early to quantify much of the activity, some numbers are startling: 10 percent of the doctors affiliated with New York Presbyterian Hospital have dropped out of managed care in the last three months, and 50 percent have whittled the plans they accept, said Dr. Myron Weisfeldt, the chairman of the hospital's department of medicine.
"There are a tremendous number of physicians that to one degree or another are beginning to separate themselves from managed care at some financial risk to themselves," he said.
And there are signs that the movement extends past New York City's borders: the Summit Medical Group, for instance, a practice with 100 doctors in Summit, N.J., recently dropped Blue Cross, and others are expected to follow suit, said Dr. Greg Sachs, president of the Medical Society of New Jersey.
 
Opposition Grows In California and Texas
 Doctors' opposition to managed care is on the increase elsewhere, as well. In California, doctors have formed a group to push their opposition, and in Texas, some are also forswearing managed care. But experts say New York is particularly interesting because doctors here are rejecting a system that is still quite new and that has rolled into the region at a breakneck speed in the last few years.
Chief among their complaints have been reduced fees and more restrictions from the insurance companies on referrals and procedures.
"California had an evolution toward managed care, and we have had a revolution," Dr. Aswad said. "And that is why you hear about these disruptions and large groups' suddenly getting out."
This movement raises difficult questions about whether doctors can and should expect to make the same good living they did before the managed care movement, and whether a decision among some of the brightest and best to drop managed care plans simply recreates the caste system of care that health maintenance organizations were meant to eliminate by providing preventive care and a variety of services.
Clearly, New York is not leaving the managed care business.
The H.M.O. Trade Conference, a trade group, said that it had not yet heard of managed care companies' worrying about a mass exodus.
But it is just as clear that in the last few months many doctors, who have been unhappy about managed care almost since its introduction to the New York area, seem to be dropping out entirely, for several reasons.
Most important, consolidation among the managed care companies has increased, underscored by the announcement that Aetna U.S. Healthcare -- whose tough bargaining on rates makes it one of the least popular insurance carriers among doctors -- will acquire Prudential Health Care.
As the companies grow larger, their ability to dictate rates and policies is likely to increase.
Further, many companies have cut reimbursement rates significantly in recent months, causing many doctors to conclude that they cannot make any money by accepting them. Doctors may also be reacting to rising complaints from their patients, and taking advantage of a strong economy that has forced many employers to be more sensitive to their workers' health care demands.
"I just couldn't stand it," said Dr. Thomashow, the pulmonary specialist in Washington Heights. "The thought of being put on hold lines by people who don't know a quarter of what you are doing to get permission for patients to go to the bathroom was distasteful to me."
He knows he may lose patients, but he said he hoped he could persuade some to stay, even if that means lowering their bills. "If patients can't pay, then they don't pay," he said. "There are patients I will make less money off of than if I took managed care, but I don't care, because it is my choice."
The revolt tends to be led by doctors who have affluent patients who are both demanding and willing to pay for the services if they must. But some doctors, whose patient population is more diverse, are trying to form groups to challenge the companies en masse.
For example, the Mount Kisco Medical Group in Mount Kisco, N.Y., has started to take advantage of its size -- 64 doctors under one roof -- to negotiate with managed care companies.
It has dropped some plans that were demanding too much paperwork, said Dr. Scott D. Hayworth, the group's chief executive officer. But it negotiated a more favorable contract with others, including Oxford and Aetna.
"We are 64 doctors," Dr. Hayworth said, "so we are lucky because we have better negotiating power. Does that mean if you could wave a magic wand and make managed care go away, would we? We would want that for sure. But we make the best of it."
 
Forming a Group Not Always a Solution
 Experts predict that more large groups will come together -- perhaps in the form of unions. But forming groups does not always assure power.
For example, in 1994 Dr. Jonas Goldstone and Dr. Saul Kaplan formed Mid-Manhattan Medical Associates, an association of 26 doctors from various specialties who organized to arrange better ancillary services, like laboratories, and to deal with managed care through a central business office.
While many of their goals as a group have been met, they have not won better reimbursement rates from insurance carriers, they said.
"We are finding out that the projected income we expected in dealing with managed care has not materialized," Dr. Goldstone said, explaining that companies have not been receptive, either because the group is too small or the companies just don't care if they lose their business.
At this point, he added, "A number of us are seriously considering exiting managed care."
If someone's doctor informs her he will no longer accept her insurance plan, the options are clear: she finds another doctor or she pays up. And if she is in a plan that partly reimburses for visits to doctors out of the network, she files a claim.
Hospitals, too, are bridling at managed care. The biggest complaint is that companies are refusing to reimburse for the full number of days that patients spend in a hospital, contending that certain illnesses can be treated in shorter stays.
"I cannot overstate enough the sense of frustration within the hospitals," said Kenneth Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, a trade group. "I have seen a whole turnabout in the last four or five months. We have gone from tolerance to feverish pitch, and we are seeking help from the authorities as well as lawmakers so H.M.O.'s stop abusing hospitals."
The association has asked the State Attorney General's office to pursue the matter of trimming days, and the association is contemplating lawsuits against individual companies, Mr. Raske said.
Some hospitals are also considering forming their own managed care companies -- common among providers of services to Medicaid recipients.
Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx is forming one such program to insure children, and hopes to extend it throughout its system.
Most doctors say that quality of care, not their own earnings, is driving their decisions.
They contend, for instance, that when managed care companies push for high-volume practices, the increased workload reduces the time they can devote to each patient, as well as to teaching, reading medical journals and working in clinics.
They also recognize the painful reality that only middle class and wealthier patients are likely to have insurance plans that allow them to choose their own doctor in exchange for a lower reimbursement rate, typically 80 percent or less.
"I don't want a practice just for rich people," said Dr. Softness, the pediatrician. "That was never my plan. But I also want to be able to give the kind of care that I think people deserve."
But some health care experts predict that a tiered health care system is in the offing with a movement like this one.
"I think we are moving toward a two-tiered or three-tiered structure of health care," said Michael Lichman, senior vice president of Willis Corroon of New York, one of the country's largest insurance brokers.
 
Despite Market Glut, Doctors' Income Rose
 Others, too, say that despite a glut of doctors in the 1980's, doctors' incomes rose higher than those of other professionals. They contend that in a supply and demand economy, lower salaries would have been expected.
"If doctors say that quality will fall as reimbursements fall, they are insulting themselves," said Uwe S. Reinhardt, a health economist at Princeton University. "The truth of the matter is that when a group of laborers are in surplus, wages fall. They are the only group that is unwilling to accept that."
Doctors who serve the poor, doctors fresh out of school who have no established patient base and doctors working in towns where one employer dominates the market are among those who simply cannot refuse managed care.
"You can't drop H.M.O.'s if you have a family to feed and a dog who depends on you," Mr. Lichman said. "Patients have become used to walking into a doctor's office and paying $10, and you can't say, 'O.K., I'm back in the fee-for-service business.' "
But as long as employers continue to offer plans that give employees a chance to go to doctors outside their networks -- which is likely in a strong economy -- and H.M.O.'s continue to push doctors to cut costs, more are likely to leave the H.M.O.'s.
"I hear every day about other groups of doctors who are dropping managed care," said Dr. Barry G. Chaiken, who founded the Association of Independent Physicians in New York, a new and growing group of doctors free of managed care.
"As managed care comes in and insists on fee discounts of 30 percent or more, physicians have to change their practices to survive," he said.

HEADLINE: Banks Put Their Faith In Building Churches;
Lending to Improve Neighborhoods

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
The storefront was plain, the street unprepossessing, and the skies sent down torrents of rain. But inside last Sunday, more than 100 members of the New Jerusalem Church were rejoicing -- singing and dancing, swaying and shouting -- as their minister thanked God, "who makes us sit together in heavenly places."
Literally. For, Bishop Altamont G. Blackwood said, "there is no more heavenly place than the church." And the congregation's new church, complete with a bell tower and steeple, is rising on Springfield Boulevard in eastern Queens, just a few blocks from the commercial strip that has been New Jerusalem's home for more than 20 years. 
 Though the congregation gives God most of the credit for the new building, He does have a most worldly partner: the Chase Manhattan Bank, which has lent the congregation more than $1 million for the project.
The bank is doing so not merely out of the goodness of its corporate heart. Under the Federal Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, banks are required to lend money to help struggling neighborhoods in which they do business. And while governments seem to have neither the will nor the power to help with community redevelopment projects, Chase and other banks are turning to God -- or at least, to some of His servants here on earth -- to do such work.
"We decided that these institutions are critical to the communities we care about," said Carol J. Parry, the bank's executive vice president for community development. "Our ultimate objective is to make those communities better places to live."
The theory behind the Chase program is fairly simple: if churches are bigger and have more seats, they can attract more parishioners, who will finance and work on more community projects. It is mostly black churches that have received loans, though the program is open to all types of congregations and faiths. The bank also provides grants and technical assistance to religious organizations. The churches pay regular commercial interest rates on the loans.
Banks have a long history of lending money for church-sponsored programs, like low-income housing. But financing church buildings as a way to help communities is something new. (Chase made its first such loan, for just $150,000, in 1994.) Other large banks, like First Union in Charlotte, N.C., are also trying to increase their involvement with churches, and the approach was featured at a conference on community redevelopment in October organized by the American Bankers Association.
Churches across the country have occasionally borrowed from banks before, though often only with the help of wealthy members willing to cosign the loans or to put up a lot of cash as security.
Black churches have had particular trouble getting loans, said Albert C. Tew, a former commercial banker who as a consultant to churches has helped arrange some loans, including New Jerusalem's. "There aren't too many lenders who are aware of how African-American churches actually operate," he said.
Gradually, however, banks are becoming aware of the critical role churches play in poor neighborhoods.
"The church is the foundation of everything we do, in housing, health care, and for senior citizens," said Edwin C. Reed, chief financial officer of the Allen African Methodist Episcopal Church in Jamaica, Queens. "Seats mean revenue to me."
Allen's history serves as a sort of parable for those who support lending to religious institutions. Membership in the church, which was founded in 1834, has soared since the Rev. Floyd H. Flake became pastor in 1976, when the church had 1,400 members and a building that could seat 200. Today, the church has a congregation of about 10,000 and offers three Sunday services at a new building that seats 2,500. The congregation raised $10 million of the $25 million cost; the rest was financed by a group of banks put together by Chase last year.
The church has become a major employer in Queens, running a dizzying array of social programs, including low-income housing, a transportation service, a center for the elderly, a shelter for battered women, a school and a project to improve local commercial strips. The neighborhood, once one of the poorest in Queens, is thriving.
Even for such a powerhouse of a church, getting a loan was not easy, for reasons Mr. Reed said he understood. Not only can it be hard to figure out where a church will get the money to repay a loan, he noted, but there is also the question of collateral. No bank would want to repossess a church, and if it did, what would it do, get corporate executives to come in to preach?
"Walter Shipley is a wonderful person," Mr. Reed said, referring to the chairman of the Chase Manhattan Corporation, "but he cannot pack my church every Sunday."
But if lending $15 million to Allen took an act of faith, lending $1 million to New Jerusalem took a real leap. After all, the church has just 250 members, almost all immigrants from the West Indies, and they are by no means rich.
And unlike Allen, whose pastor was also a Congressman for many years, New Jerusalem is not a force in local politics. Not only is Mr. Blackwood not a politician, but he does not even know any politicians, he said. "I haven't even shaken any one of their hands," he said. "This is a straight loan. I had no strings to pull."
But what their leader does have is a financial track record. Now 52, Mr. Blackwood has been preaching since he was a teen-ager in Jamaica, and he came to this country in 1970. Within seven years, he had scraped together enough money to make a down payment on a little building on Francis Lewis Boulevard, where he started his church, whose full name is the New Jerusalem Church of God in Christ Jesus (Apostolic) Inc. The $57,000 building was paid for in three years.
When it was started, his congregation had only five members -- all related to him and living in the small apartment over the church, Mr. Blackwood recalled. He remodeled the building himself, moving the bathrooms, finishing the basement, painting the tiny office.
Today, the sanctuary has wood-paneled walls, a drop ceiling and wall-to-wall carpeting; the wooden pews are supplemented with folding chairs when the crowd gets too big, which it often does.
In 1990, Mr. Blackwood found a vacant lot for sale; he raised and borrowed money for the down payment and got a five-year mortgage from the owner. Within three years, he and the congregation had paid off the $127,500 cost of the land.
The congregation has also raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for the new church, and this accomplishment is one of the reasons Chase was comfortable making such a large loan to such a small group, said Earlene Hampton, vice president of the Chase Community Development Corporation, the unit of the bank that made the loan last spring.
How has the congregation come up with so much cash? And how will it cover the roughly $150,000 annual mortgage payment?
The church does some fund-raising. It sells oranges from Florida and sponsors bus trips to family-oriented spots like the theme park Sesame Place in Langhorne, Pa., said Maria Angus, the church's secretary. Elfreda Moore, a 78-year-old matriarch of the church, sells hats outside the doors on Saturdays.
But most of the money comes out of church members' pockets. Many of them tithe, giving a tenth of their incomes to the church, and they also contribute to special fund-raising campaigns, Mr. Blackwood said. "Some folks that give it, give their last mite," he said. "but they find such favor and love in what we are doing that they give what they have to give."
Certainly, they seem to be giving with joy. At last week's noon service, the plate was not passed; rather, members filed to the front of the church to contribute money and checks. Once the offering was completed, Clara Pettigrew led the choir dancing down the aisle and then back up to the front, as everyone sang that they would "Walk and Talk in the New Jerusalem Way."
It does not hurt the fund-raising effort that neither Mr. Blackwood nor the assistant ministers receive a salary from the church. Mr. Blackwood owns a small hardware store, and his wife works at Jamaica Hospital Medical Center, where, as part of his ministry, he leads services in the psychiatric ward twice a month. Although he supervises almost a dozen Apostolic churches in and around New York, he continues to live simply and to spend the church's money very carefully, said Mr. Tew, the consultant.
The people who give the most will get the best seats in the new church -- and those seats will be grand. Pews for 650 people will fill the floor and balcony under a soaring wooden ceiling. Glass blocks in the stone walls will form stylized crosses in the front and back of the huge room. There will be enough space on the dais up front for all the ministers and elders, the senior and junior choirs, and even a baptismal pool.
In the basement, there will be room to serve hot lunches to 270 needy people, and to expand the church's free food distribution program. These programs are now run out of the old church's cramped basement, which does not have a kitchen or enough exits to accommodate much of a crowd. That old building will be turned into a church-sponsored day care center.
These plans were crucial in Chase's decision to give the church a loan, Ms. Parry said. And so was confidence that the congregation would grow to fill the new church.
The median household income in the mostly black neighborhood is about $58,700 a year, according to projections by the Queens College sociology department. The mostly single-family homes in the neighborhood are small but neat; many of the commercial areas, however, are far less prosperous-looking.
The new church is replacing decrepit buildings on land that was being used as an illegal dump, church members say; it sits between two open lots, their fences festooned with signs advertising everything from used cars to goat meat.
Mr. Blackwood hopes to acquire these lots someday, to add more parking, perhaps even to build a school. But for now, he is just trying to restrain his impatience to see the church completed, and to plan a ceremony for the grand opening, which he hopes will be in March.
And, along with his congregation, he is literally counting his blessings. The list last Sunday was long -- the service lasted almost three hours -- and included all kinds of things, spiritual and physical, including the new church.
"I didn't dream He would lend us more than $1 million to build a church, just a small group of people as we are," Mr. Blackwood said, as exclamations of "Jesus!" and "Hallelujah!" rose from the congregation. "He made a way where there was no way."

HEADLINE: Off the Urban Rust Heap, a Factory Goes to Work

BYLINE: By ALEX PRUD'HOMME

 BODY:
THE dark brick factory complex on the Brooklyn waterfront would not look out of place in a moody industrial landscape by Edward Hopper. A few years ago, most of the windows were broken, roofs were collapsing, interiors were contaminated with asbestos and the basement was cluttered with leaking drums of toxic substances. The city, which owned the site in the Greenpoint neighborhood, was on the verge of demolishing this cluster of buildings.
Walk inside today, though, and you find a warren of vibrant spaces filled with hundreds of woodworkers, artists and craftsmen. You hear hammering and grinding noises, smell oil paint and sawdust and see teams of cabinet makers banging together kitchen cabinets -- or a single artist laboring over multicolored spiral glass sculptures. 
 Built in the 19th century as a rope factory, the complex at 1155 Manhattan Avenue -- actually eight connected buildings -- is now home to the Greenpoint Manufacturing and Design Center, a nonprofit corporation that provides woodworkers and artists with affordable work space in a communal environment.
"If I hadn't moved here, I'd be out of business," said Ricky Eisenberg, the owner of Creative Cabinets and Carpentry Ltd., one of the center's 68 tenants. "In Manhattan, I was paying double the rent for a quarter of the space I have here. So now I have an eightfold advantage. This building is run by half-communism, half-capitalism, and it works out pretty good."
However muddled the ideology, urban experts count the Greenpoint project in the vanguard of a campaign to revive inner-city industrial zones one building at a time.
"We didn't really have any models for how to do this," said David Sweeny, 34, the center's chief executive. "We aren't visionaries with 10-year plans for incubator projects. We're problem-solvers, opportunists."
In New York, as in cities across the country, opportunities abound for creative reuse of the derelict hubs of once-thriving manufacturing economies. Over the last three decades, thousands of New York's manufacturers have been driven out of business or out of the city, the victims of escalating rents, taxes and crime rates; onerous zoning regulations, and tight-fisted banks.
But the Greenpoint center offers a model for bringing some of the abandoned industrial space back to life. In the early 1990's, Mr. Sweeny and his board of directors cobbled together a patchwork of financial support from public and private sources, and -- with political pluck, the good will of suppliers and the sweat equity of tenants -- took control of the complex.
In 1994, the first year of operation, the buildings were in such bad shape that the center could rent only 40,000 square feet of space to 12 businesses. Today, virtually the entire 360,000-square-foot complex is rented, and its tenants employ 460 people.
The project has generated jobs and job training for Greenpoint, a blue-collar neighborhood with a population that is largely Polish, Irish and Hispanic. It is contributing $135,000 a year to the city in property taxes and about $800,000 in city and state payroll taxes. There is a long waiting list of prospective tenants. Mr. Sweeny's organization is consulting for a number of like-minded nonprofit groups, has just opened a for-profit furniture business and is evaluating other old industrial sites where it hopes to reproduce its brand of what Mr. Sweeny calls "commie venture capitalism."
"I'm not at all surprised by their success," said Anne Habiby, director of research at the Institute for a Competitive Inner City, a group in Cambridge, Mass., that was founded by Michael S. Porter, a Harvard Business School professor, to promote business expansion in distressed urban areas. What the Greenpoint center has done, she said, "is to reproduce in microcosm the elements of a successful economy."
And while the Greenpoint group isn't the only one in the country doing this kind of work, she said, "they are way out ahead of the curve."
 
Pioneers in the Wreckage
The buildings at 1155 Manhattan Avenue became the city's problem in 1972, when their last owner, the Grossen Dye Works, failed to pay its taxes. Left largely empty and decaying, the complex fell into further disrepair.
In the 1980's, a few artists and woodworkers were allowed to take 30-day leases on odd spaces scattered around the buildings, as long as they agreed to plug leaks, build walls and wire the work spaces themselves. The rent was minimal and the space was vast, but only a few pioneers were willing to take the risk.
"The building was a wasteland," recalled Dennis Niswander, an abstract painter who found his way to Greenpoint in 1982, after the rent tripled on his Times Square studio. "I'd have to walk through 10,000 square feet of empty, decrepit space to get to my studio," said Mr. Niswander, now the center's physical-plant manager.
"It was emergency conditions all over," he said.
The city closed down some parts of the buildings for code violations, estimating the cost of necessary renovations at $14 million. The complex was shopped to residential developers, but with the drop in real estate prices in the mid-80's, there was little interest.
In the meantime, tenants who were fed up with conditions in the complex banded together as the Woodworking Center Equity Corporation, to manage the building and negotiate leases. They hired Mr. Niswander to do major repairs, like fixing a burst water main. He and a crew of three removed some 250 tons of scrap metal and learned to move abandoned machines weighing up to two tons with nothing but crowbars.
In the process, they developed a sense of ownership for a crumbling structure that, it seemed, no one else wanted.
"This building has retained a kind of aesthetic and human history not documented anywhere," Mr. Niswander said. "I crawled around every square inch of it, until it became like the exterior of my skin."
Mr. Sweeny entered the picture in 1990. A slight, bearded economics graduate of the University of Vermont, he had a mild manner that concealed a strong will. At the time, he was the director of economic development for the North Brooklyn Development Corporation, a nonprofit community group. Forgoing the Harvard Business School, where he had been admitted, Mr. Sweeny became swept up in Mr. Niswander's enthusiasm.
"I'd been studying how to bring employment to low-income neighborhoods, and this project seemed like a great lab experiment in which to test my theories," Mr. Sweeny said.
Along with the angry tenants and a number of volunteer real estate and legal specialists, the two men incorporated the Greenpoint Manufacturing and Design Center in May 1992 and applied to buy the entire complex.
"It seemed so elegantly simple," Mr. Sweeny said. "The city was getting no taxes from this building and they had no buyer, yet it was filling up with tenants who were willing to fix it themselves. I thought it would be easy."
But it wasn't. On Thanksgiving weekend in 1992, inspectors from the city's Department of Buildings shut down the elevators, calling them unsafe, and fined a sister agency, the Department of Real Property, which owned the buildings. Unable to make deliveries to the upper floors, 60 outraged woodworkers protested by smashing wooden chairs into splinters on the steps of City Hall.
"It was a highly balkanized situation," recalled Leslie Winter, a former assistant commissioner in the Division of Real Property who now is chairman of the center's board. "The city was fining itself, and everybody had different ideas on what should be done with the building."
A few months later, the city's Economic Development Corporation allowed Mr. Sweeny's group to take over management of the building, though not the leasing of space.
The galvanizing moment came in 1993, when city officials refused to allow a French furniture maker to finance $500,000 in improvements and lease 30,000 square feet in the complex. Mr. Sweeny and Mr. Niswander had had enough. They created a 200-page development schedule and invited city politicians to Greenpoint, "to smell the sawdust and see the furniture," Mr. Sweeny said.
Carl Weisbrod, then the president of the Economic Development Corporation, visited the site on his own and agreed to intervene on the center's behalf. On Feb. 28, 1994, the city sold the building to Mr. Sweeny's group for $1. The city had already spent $750,000 on an environmental cleanup of the site and now promised to set aside an additional $1 million for safety improvements, like fixing the sprinkler system and elevators.
"From the city's perspective, we assumed a $14 million liability for a dollar," Mr. Niswander said.
 
Building a Balance Sheet
In 1994, the center lost $180,000. "The first year was the worst time for us -- and the best," Mr. Sweeny recalled, stroking his seeing-eye dog, named Mr. Rogers, as he sat in his modest, doorless office at the center. Born with retinoblastoma, a rare form of cancer that causes a tumor on the eye, Mr. Sweeny has gradually lost all of his sight over the last few years -- though, as long as he could, he continued to bicycle fearlessly across the Brooklyn Bridge.
In that difficult first year, Mr. Sweeny said, enthusiasm did much to keep the project going. The managers granted rent credits to tenants for renovation work they had done on their own spaces; some contractors and materials suppliers deferred their compensation, and Mr. Sweeny, who was working full-time at the center by this time, didn't take a salary for the first 10 months.
"That's the part of the model that I'm not sure others can replicate -- everyone's dedication," Mr. Sweeny said. "It was completely crazy. I didn't know how we were going to finance our operations. I didn't even know who our tenants were going to be. A sophisticated real-estate person would have told us, 'There's no light at the end of this tunnel -- no light.' "
That was certainly what Mr. Sweeny was told by most of the financiers he approached.
"Our first year we were shopping for a line of credit and were continually rejected," he said. "The banks gave us good chat on the phone, but they were skeptical."
Fortunately, there were other sources of help. When the founders established the Greenpoint Center organization, a grant of $7,500 from the J. P. Morgan Charitable Trust accounted for nearly a third of its budget.
"In a situation like that, a little bit of money goes a long way," said Hildy J. Simmons, managing director of community relations and philanthropic services at J. P. Morgan. "In grant-making, you try to support the right people, and we really responded to David Sweeny. He was determined to make things happen. What he's done is the best of modest-scale economic development in the city."
Since taking possession of the building, the group has received additional small grants from the Morgan trust and from Brooklyn Union Gas and Chase Manhattan Bank; aid from foundations like the New York Foundation, which helps support grass-roots neighborhood projects, and loans from agencies like the Federal Office of Community Services and the Nonprofit Facilities Fund, a private group that has some city financing.
The center has used the money to improve the services it offers to tenants -- from computer training programs and apprenticeships for underprivileged teen-agers to help for cabinetmakers in learning to market their skills.
Today, the center, with an operating budget of about $1 million a year, is self-sufficient. Rents pay for the upkeep and improvement of the buildings' windows, roofs and elevators and underwrite a full-time construction crew.
"If all of our grants were to dry up tomorrow, the building would be fine," Mr. Sweeny said. "We just wouldn't be able to offer our training programs. What we do isn't social welfare for small businesses; it's strict economic development."
The center is finishing the last phase of its renovation, bringing the cost to $6.8 million -- $3 million from the center's earnings and the remainder from a combination of grants and loans from Government and private sources. The total is half what the city had projected for restoration, but the project has been spread over four years, instead of the one-year plan that the city favored.
One of the center's strengths has been staying true to its mission of keeping rents affordable and building a community of woodworkers and artists. The directors -- "four hippie woodworkers; four gray suits from the worlds of finance, architecture and law, and me," is how Mr. Sweeny characterized them -- made it a priority.
"We had fishmongers looking to rent space, and it was tempting to take their money," he said. "But we learned that real estate becomes more valuable when you restrict the kinds of tenants you allow in."
By being part of a critical mass of businesses that draw on similar skills, trade their resources and do not compete directly with one another -- all at a strategic location near Manhattan -- the center's tenants "gain a clear competitive advantage," said Ms. Habiby of the Initiative for a Competitive Inner City.
"The power of business development is around clusters," she said. She pointed to Grand Rapids, Mich., the location of another emerging woodworking cluster, and to a telecommunications cluster that has flourished in downtown Oakland, Calif.
The concept is as old as the Middle Eastern bazaar or the European farmers' market and as fundamental to urban life as the flower, fish and food markets that still thrive, to varying degrees, in even the creakiest American cities. But it is being rediscovered after several decades in which the growth of American light industry was largely in the suburbs or the cities of the Sun Belt.
The Brooklyn center, Ms. Habiby said, "is certainly a model for others to watch." And, she added, "their mix of funding seems ideal."

Many Languages, Few Borders
Inside 1155 Manhattan Avenue, the work spaces range from an artist's 600-square-foot studio to a 30,000-square-foot woodworking operation that employs 70 people on three floors. Average rents in the building are $4 to $5 a square foot, compared with $10 to $12 for comparable space in Manhattan and $7 to $9 in Queens.
"Every time you open a door, it's a new story," said Mariusz Cwalina, the building superintendent, a native of Poland whose father is a woodworker at the center. "You could wander in here for a week, and every person you meet is speaking a different language and doing something different."
Tenants often give one another advice or work together on projects. "There's a lot of cross-pollination here," said Paul Seide, a glass artist who has been at the center since 1990. Mr. Seide makes colorful glass spirals filled with neon gas, and another tenant makes wooden pedestals for the spirals to sit on.
In 1994, the complex invested $200,000 in a wood production center, filling an L-shaped room with new woodworking machinery for communal use. Last October, the center established Spacecraft, its first for-profit business, a joint venture with the furniture designer Jonas Milder, who is based in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, to build and distribute a line of tables, desks and bookcases.
Critics have questioned the harnessing of for-profit subsidiaries to nonprofit organizations, saying such connections can create misunderstanding of a nonprofit's finances and pollute its philanthropic mission. But Mr. Sweeny, ever the pragmatist, dismisses naysayers. If Spacecraft succeeds, he said, "we'll put the profits back into the building, which is good for everyone."
Mr. Sweeny, who draws a $50,000 salary from the Greenpoint center, says that he is actively seeking to replicate the project in another industrial site of similar vintage. But he allows that it won't be any easier the next time around.
"In retrospect, I'm astonished we survived," he said. "It would be a disservice to tell people they can put together a deal the way we did. I think we managed it because of the unique amalgam of people we have here. You can't franchise that. But if we can find the right opportunity, we might try it again."

HEADLINE: Mortgage Tax Break: Who Gets What

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSON

 BODY:
The income-tax deduction for home mortgage interest is one of the most popular politically, but its economic effects are perverse: Experts call it an "upside down" subsidy because the more a taxpayer earns, the greater the tax cut it yields.
 
 But the degree to which that is true is obscured by the way Washington policy makers usually present the figures. Congress recently released its annual chart on the subject, showing that, in aggregate, 20 percent of the tax savings from deducting home mortgage interest go to taxpayers making more than $200,000 a year.
 But when savings are compared taxpayer by taxpayer instead of in big lump sums, the skew toward the top income groups is much starker.
 By this measure, for each dollar in tax savings going to the average taxpayer making $200,000 or more, the average taxpayer in all lower income groups combined saves just 6 cents. Taxpayers making $30,000 to $40,000, putting them on the lower rungs of the middle class, save 2 cents on the dollar, and those making less than $10,000 save an average of 3 one-thousandths of a cent.
 Looked at another way, for each dollar in tax saved by the average taxpayer making less than $10,000, an average taxpayer in the top income group saves $29,200.

HEADLINE: MUSIC;
Jazz's Best-Known Label at 60

BYLINE: By PETER WATROUS 

 BODY:
WHEN Alfred Lion, a refugee from Nazi Germany, founded Blue Note Records in New York in 1939, he had no idea that the small label would become an item of worship. This month, celebrating its 60th anniversary, Blue Note is filling clubs in Manhattan with past and present members of its roster.
The widespread adoration of the label has its roots in the Lion's extraordinarily high level of artistic production. Over the years, the label recorded Bud Powell, Miles Davis, Thelonious Monk, Art Blakey, Freddie Hubbard and Wayne Shorter. No other record label in jazz has been as consistent in quality. And the art that has adorned its album covers has become iconic, copied, used ironically on pop albums or as part of pop design. It has become a brand name. In 1994, an English book of the label's record covers confirmed that its imprimatur had extended beyond the jazz world; a year later Rizzoli published a coffee-table book of photographs by the label's co-founder, Francis Wolff, called "The Blue Note Years." There had been earlier hints that the jazz world wasn't going to be big enough for the label: a discography and several waves of reissues, including previously unissued material, not all of it worthy of Lion's stamp of approval. 
 Jazz fans could talk about their favorite Blue Note record, the sumptuousness of the label's sound. They could even discuss who the engineer was (usually Rudy Van Gelder) and where the sessions mostly took place (at Mr. Van Gelder's studio in Englewood, N.J.). But nobody would have predicted the sort of adulation that has transpired.
In 1968, the label, which had always been a small independent company, was bought by the conglomerate United Artists, and the quality plummeted; it was no longer run by the legendarily fastidious Lion, who died in 1987. By 1976, the label had closed down. Eight years later it started up again. At the time jazz, which had undergone the worst period in its history, was beginning to show a quickening pulse. Blue Note had also become the jazz wing of a major label, Capital, giving it the financial wherewithal to work with. It was to be run by Bruce Lundvall, a jazz fan who had been the president of Columbia Records and later president at Elektra and Capital. As an inducement to run Capital, he was asked to restart Blue Note; it was his favorite label.
Some of the intense interest in the label is a testament to its own marketing plan: Mr. Lundvall has always presented the company as special, distinct from the rest of the jazz world. To take advantage of the hunger on the part of rap artists, the label packaged a series of compilations intended for sampling. It licensed material to the mail-order reissue company Mosaic, which put out anthologies of Blue Note material in boxed sets that appealed to the fetish collector in all of us. And the company has routinely figured out ways of packaging and repackaging the same catalogue, creating limited edition series along with boxed sets of some of the labels bigger stars like Dexter Gordon and Herbie Hancock.
During Mr. Lundvall's tenure Blue Note has come close to reproducing the impulse of the original label. He has had failures, but in the last few years he has taken the company to its best position since Lion left. It's now the only major label dedicated to the adventurous mainstream, just as it was under Lion's leadership.
This month's celebration might be seen as cynical on the part of the record company, as simple self-aggrandizement. But for anyone who knows Mr. Lundvall, it's clear that marketing and love of the music aren't mutually exclusive. And Mr. Lundvall is anything but cynical.
At 63, he's one of the few jazz record company executives who goes out to hear music regularly; if somebody tips him off to promising young musicians, he'll actually stay out late to hear them. He'll set up auditions for those who come highly recommended. And he has done his best to balance the needs of a major label accustomed to thinking in the economic terms of pop music and the unpleasant reality of jazz sales.
So Mr. Lundvall has signed pop jazz artists like Everett Harp and Richard Elliot, whose sales offset the losses incurred by the serious young jazz musicians he has brought in. The reissue program produces a windfall. The CD version of John Coltrane's "Blue Trane," for example, has sold some 300,000 copies in the United States alone; Herbie Hancock's "Maiden Voyage" has sold 150,000 copies here. And he has tried to keep the scale of the original label. In the 1950's, it released slews of albums because the economy was right; while the albums didn't cost much to make, they didn't sell particularly well either, usually between 2,000 and 3,000 copies. Jazz record companies today, caught in the pop world, now release fewer albums and expect them to sell more.
MR. LUNDVALL, like Lion, has let the other major labels take most of the expensive jazz stars and has instead worked on signing lesser-known musicians and turning them into important figures. The result is a string of powerful albums by the saxophonist Greg Osby and a promising first album by the vibraphonist Stephon Harris. Mr. Lundvall signed the singer Cassandra Wilson when she was a virtual unknown; she's now selling well, even in pop terms, and is one of the best-known singers in jazz. Joe Lovano, the veteran saxophonist, has flourished on the label. Mr. Lundvall has also signed two of Cuba's most brilliant pianists, Chucho Valdez and Gonzalo Rubalcaba. He has nurtured the career of the young, gifted pianist Jackie Terrasson, releasing four albums by him. And the trumpeter Tim Hagens, virtually unknown, has released four albums, including a recent mixture of jazz and the dance style drum-and-bass.
Like the original Blue Note, Mr. Lundvall's version doesn't define any single vision of the avant-garde, but it does tread between the old and new styles. He likes swingers in the jazz tradition, but swingers that think, that are looking for the new without forgetting the old. And there are exceptions to even his traditionalism: the clarinetist Don Byron now records for Blue Note, as do Medeski, Martin and Wood, a jazz funk group.
There's a farm system at the company, somewhat like the one at the original Blue Note. Mr. Lundvall listens to musicians' advice; Mr. Osby brought the pianist Jason Moran to his attention, and Mr. Lundvall signed him. The young saxophonist Mark Shim came to his attention through the singer Betty Carter. The pianist James Hurt, who has recorded with one of the more thoughtful of the current crop of Blue Note musicians, the saxophonist Sherman Irby, has a development deal with the label.
The farm team guarantees the label a future, as long as Mr. Lundvall can keep the company solvent by juggling the money makers and the money losers. So far, it has worked, and he has made Blue Note the best of the major labels in jazz. He, and the label, deserve their month of recognition, if not more.

HEADLINE: St. John The Unfinished;
Dean of Cathedral on Morningside Heights Vows to Fix What He's Got, Not Build More

BYLINE: By DAVID KIRBY 

 BODY:
THE Cathedral of St. John the Divine, more than a century in the making, may never be really finished. Construction of the world's largest cathedral has always been on-again, off-again. Now it's off again, for the forseeable future, as guardians of the Episcopal cathedral turn to preserving what has been built instead of pushing further skyward. While the unbuilt towers, spires and transepts designed years ago wait, church leaders face a new challenge: how to raise millions of dollars to maintain the beloved stone church at Amsterdam Avenue and 110th Street on Morningside Heights.
Since the cornerstone was laid in 1892, construction has been halted by engineering problems, economic shortfalls and changing architectural tastes -- which helps explain the jumble of Gothic, Romanesque and Byzantine styles -- as well as two world wars, the social upheaval of the 1960's and the real estate bust of the late 1980's. 
 This time the decision not to resume building is based more on internal than external influences. As recently as 1996, cathedral officials were talking of starting a $100 million building fund to resume construction, which had stopped in 1992. But then the cathedral got a new Dean, the Very Rev. Harry H. Pritchett Jr., who decided it was time to shelve the dream of his predecessor, the Very Rev. James Parks Morton, to at least complete the south tower. Dean Pritchett persuaded church leaders that they had little choice: Either act now to preserve what has been built over the past century or there will be no structure left to build on in the next.
But financing the repairs, cathedral officials say, will not be easy. Passing the plate, even in a church that can seat 2,500 worshipers at a time, will not raise the estimated $20 million to $40 million needed to fix up the cathedral. The problem, officials concede, is that from a fund-raising viewpoint, maintenance is not exciting. It would be easier, they figure, to raise that level of money for an imaginative array of social programs or to finish the south tower, now partly covered in blue sheeting, with the 20-year-old scaffolding rusting onto the cream-colored granite. The idea now is to remove the scaffolding and cap the tower with a temporary, modernist plastic crown that could remain for years, an apt reminder of the cathedral's nickname: St. John the Unfinished.
Dean Morton wanted to keep building. Dean Pritchett does not. "Dean Morton had some wonderful ideas about completing the cathedral, or at least the south tower," Dean Pritchett said. "He and his leadership had a great vision of the cathedral as a community building effort. I share much of that, but I think my role is to position for that to happen in the future.
"Rather than simply focusing on completing the cathedral, we've got to preserve what's there in order to one day finish it," Dean Pritchett continued. "Sure, we could argue back and forth about whether it's really advantageous to have the biggest Gothic cathedral in the world, but the truth is, we've already got it. So the question becomes, what to do with it? How can you be a good steward of this incredible gift?"
Crumbling buildings and an unfinished cathedral were not all that Dean Pritchett faced when he took the helm. He has also had to deal with a chronic budget deficit, which was $750,000 in the year ended June 1998, a desire for more social programs, and traditional tensions between the cathedral's trustees and the trustees of the Diocese of New York over the cathedral's mission, programs and administration.
The cathedral, by definition, is the seat of the Bishop, the Right Rev. Richard F. Grein, who heads the diocese and is chairman of both boards. But the property is in the hands of the cathedral's trustees and the Dean, who oversees 122 people, including priests and a full-time staff. "The Diocese is here and the Dean is here and the way the polity is set up, the Bishop is in charge," Dean Pritchett said. "He is in authority, and yet the trustees and the Dean own the property."
"This is a very complex organization," he said. "It needed new development, new reconciliation, new building up of leadership.
"The tension and the ambiguity between the cathedral corporation and the diocese corporation is now more creative," Dean Pritchett continued, "rather than the divisive and destructive tension there had been in the more recent past."
Did that tension include a debate over construction versus repairs. "I don't want to get into that," the Dean said. "I inherited the tension, and my goal is to not cover over it but to help reconciliation to take place so we can go forward. People are caring about the cathedral as an incredibly important part of the life of the city. It must be preserved."
The Dean seems to have gathered support for his proposed maintenance regimen. "This was not a difficult decision to make," said Bishop Grein, who took over from the Right Rev. Paul Moore Jr. in 1989. "Cathedrals have long lives and go through all kinds of phases. This isn't a dramatic move in terms of a cathedral."
Bishop Grein, who in 1992 claimed that the cathedral could be completed in 20 years for $100 million, said spending on maintenance could save millions later. "If you don't do this," he said, "the dollar costs keep growing. Last time the dome leaked, it wiped out all the reconstruction we had done on the organ and we had to start all over again."
But Dean Morton, now Dean Emeritus of the cathedral, said he was saddened to see his dream deferred. "Construction of the cathedral is part of its mission," he said, noting that Bishop Grein was expected to retire in a few years, perhaps shifting diocesan politics again. "My hope and my prayer," he said, "is that once the transition is over and the new bishop is there and there's a new dynamic in operation, that construction will again be part of the ongoing agenda of the cathedral."
Dean Morton was skeptical about how successful a fund-raising drive for building maintenance might be. "Repairing sidewalks and removing scaffolding is hardly earth shattering," he said. "It's hard to raise money for that kind of thinking. In fact, I think it's a downer. Forgive me for saying so, but putting a cap on the tower, that's not an upper. That's a downer. Obviously, they're putting a lid on construction. I suppose you can turn that around into a positive thing, but it's not a very sexy thing."
Still, he acknowledged, repairs are needed. "You have to do that," he said. "Cathedrals are monsters. They are big, heavy and very expensive. They've got to be maintained. If not, you're in deep trouble."
Dean Pritchett and the executive vice president of St. John the Divine, Stephen Facey, have hired a real estate consultant to look into ways of generating income from the property. They have also retained the firm of Polshek Partnership Architects to survey conditions and develop a plan to address structural problems and to improve the cathedral and its 13.5-acre grounds. A preliminary five-year plan envisions spending some $20 million on a range of projects, from repairing the south tower masonry to replacing the nave roof to fixing stained-glass windows to restoring other features of the property.
Among the many unfinished construction projects, the south tower remains the most obvious. Work on it began in 1978 under Dean Morton. Updating a medieval tradition, he created a program that trained neighborhood youths in the art of stone cutting. He secured outside money and support from a real estate developer, David Teitelbaum, who helped establish a company for the project.
That was "during the whole 'Bonfire of the Vanities' period, when everybody was having marble kitchens and bathrooms and foyers built," Dean Morton said. "David spent millions on high-tech laser stone cutters and we began training young people. He was able to expand the number of workers from 5 to 20 to almost 70 at one point."
The idea was to raise money for the tower while training people to cut stone for it. But in 1992, after 50 feet was built with some $10 million in donations, the project stopped. "It got very complicated," Dean Morton said. "The financial panic hit and the real estate situation really sort of went to hell. Suddenly the market collapsed and the company was in a situation with all this expensive machinery, and for all practical purposes the company went bankrupt."
Today, the stoneyard is silent, some pieces carved into Gothic spires, others still in raw form. "Everything that was built, it's paid for," Dean Morton said. "And just sitting there are the stones, waiting to go up, also paid for."
Another project that started and stopped, though much longer ago, is the north transept, also known as the Women's Transept because money to build it was raised solely by women. (Transepts are the massive wings that complete the cross pattern of typical cathedrals.)
Construction on the north transept began during the Depression and ended on Dec. 7, 1941, Pearl Harbor day. Today, with a temporary roof and the original interior construction scaffolding, the space is used for a gift shop. If the south transept were to be built, an 1843 Greek Revival building would have to be moved or demolished. "I really don't think that will be an issue any time in our lifetime," said Andrew S. Dolkart, a historian who teaches at Columbia University's School of Architecture and is the author of "Morningside Heights: A History of Its Architecture and Development" (Columbia University Press, 1998).
Mr. Dolkart, who supports the building hiatus, said he did not think much more would be constructed in this generation, except perhaps the south tower. No one knows when, or if, the north tower, the transepts and massive central tower and spire meant to soar above the crossing will ever be completed.
The original design, by the architectural firm of Heins & La Farge, featured a largely Byzantine interior, with rounded arches and windows. But in 1907, as architectural fashions were shifting, George Heins died. Four years later, Christopher Grant La Farge was ousted from the project amid tremendous controversy. This paved the way for a Gothic Revival architect, Ralph Adams Cram, to take over. Cram set out to "eradicate any hint of the original Byzantine design," Mr. Dolkart said. But construction stopped before he could finish.
"The dramatic history of the building is very evident from its appearance," Mr. Dolkart said. "You have this unfinished part, this beautiful Byzantine section that is still visible. So even if they were to decide they wanted to continue with construction, how would they deal with these points where the Byzantine and the Gothic meet? Do you keep the Byzantine features? How do you keep them? And how do you finish without losing this character that so many people appreciate?"
Some interior column capitals are still uncarved, as are many blocks intended to be interior and exterior statues. The back, or ambulatory, wall has exposed concrete. And the rough-hewn granite of some support walls in the crossing remains exposed, lending a cavelike feeling to the immense space. "Many people feel the incomplete, raw space is their favorite part," Mr. Dolkart said. "They really love it."
Dean Pritchett sees it this way: "Even if someone came in here tomorrow with a check to finish the cathedral, sure, it would be wonderful. But on the other hand, you would think, 'Gosh, is this what the church ought to be putting $100 million or $150 million into?' "
Dean Pritchett said cathedral officials were considering a special fund-raising campaign for the preservation effort , but added, "There's a lot to do to put that in place." He said his time and cathedral resources were stretched among various needs, among them vital programs, like those aiding the poor, the homeless and people with AIDS, reform of the cathedral bureaucracy and maintenance of the church buildings.
Connie Hildesly, one of the cathedral's 16 trustees, said she expected support for the idea of repairing and maintaining the property instead of pressing ahead with plans to build. "Harry Pritchett's style is to be very consensus building, so we expect a healthy discussion," she said.
Bishop Moore, who said he was no longer involved in cathedral politics, observed that what went on inside a cathedral was more important than the physical structure. "The medieval cathedral in Europe was the center of political activity," he said. "Plus there were women nursing and children playing and goats wandering around. It was very different from English cathedrals, which are on grassy hills, removed from the town, clean and quiet. But this is beat-up, eclectic, dirty New York."
"Everyone wants to see the tower finished," Bishop Moore said. "But if you want it bad enough, where's the $10 million?" In any case, he said, there is nothing wrong with an uncompleted cathedral. "St. John the Unfinished is O.K. with me," he said. "New York is an unfinished city."
 
Even the Five-Year Plan Will Cost $20 Million
It takes time, money and devotion to care for a 106-year-old monument, especially one with 120,000 square feet of floor space on 13.5 acres of property with a collection of aging buildings, gardens and statuary.
With the help of the firm of Polshek Partnership Architects, the Dean, the Very Rev. Harry H. Pritchett Jr., and his staff have come up with a five-year plan for fixing up the property.
The most notable change would take place on Amsterdam Avenue between 110th and 113th Streets. That is where the cathedral's main entrance and western facade are situated, as well as the entrance to the close, which holds cathedral and diocesan offices living quarters, a school, majestic trees, landscaped gardens and a spectacular outdoor pulpit.
Preliminary first-stage plans call for spending $4.32 million on various projects, including repair of the masonry of the south tower, which was raised 50 feet above the nave roof before construction was halted in 1992. Rusting scaffolding put up in 1978 would have to remain until the pointing was done. The tower would be waterproofed, and glass would replace the blue plastic that flaps in the windows. A $600,000 funnel-shaped crown might be placed atop the tower until construction resumes someday.
"It's a screen to protect the top of the stones and the steel that is up there for an eventual carillon," said Stephen Facey, executive vice president of St. John. "It's also a way to signal that we are not finished, that we're not trying to pretend this a finished tower."
Other first-stage projects would include wrapping the main stairway around the southwest corner, clearing out piles of cut and uncut stones in the nave garden, new fencing, signage and outdoor illumination and opening up the close. "We really want to beautify the entrance," said the Right. Rev. Richard F. Grein, who heads the diocese. "We have 500,000 visitors a year."
There is talk of moving the Peace Fountain, a massive bronze sculpture by Greg Wyatt installed in 1985, to another part of the property. Dean Pritchett refused to comment on the fountain, which some find fascinating and others repugnant.
The second stage would be a $4.8 million restoration of the 1843 Town Building, a crumbling Greek Revival structure south of the cathedral that houses many social programs. The work would include masonry repair, roofing, new windows and doors, pedestrian links to the nave, wheelchair access and new lighting.
Next would come renovations to the cathedral apse and school, which would cost an estimated $2.94 million, including repair of the roof and stained glass windows and restoration of the St. James Chapel. The upper school playground would be moved, and a new entry to the cathedral would be created, on Morningside Drive. New fencing, signs and lighting would be installed.
Plans also call for $3.17 million worth of work to replace the nave roof, repair stained glass windows, restore the nave garden, the north pedestrian way, the Diocesan House window and resurface the south drive.
The final stage envisions a new entry, with access for the disabled, for the south tower elevator, widening of the front walkway, restoration of the north field and new gates and lighting. The estimated cost? $4.1 million.
And that five-year plan could be just a beginning. Cathedral officials said $40 million could be spent rehabilitating all structures on the property. DAVID KIRBY

 CORRECTION:
A picture caption last Sunday about the Cathedral of St. John the Divine reversed the identities of the present and former Deans of the cathedral. The current Dean, the Very Rev. Harry H. Pritchett Jr., was at the left; the former one the Very Rev. James Parks Morton, was at the right.
A time line chart on Jan. 10 tracing the continuing construction of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine misstated the surname of the Episcopal Bishop of New York who announced in 1887 that the cathedral would be built. He was Henry Codman Potter, not Porter. The error was pointed out on Jan. 19 in a telephone call from the Bishop's great-great-nephew, which was misdirected to an editor who was traveling.

Charts: "TIME LINE -- Rome Took a While, Too"
Some memorable dates in the history of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine on Morningside Heights:
 
1887 -- Bishop Henry Codman Porter of the Episcopal Disocese of New calls for a great cathedral to rival St. Patrick's Cathedral, the Catholic edifice being built on Fifth Avenue. Wealthy Episcopalian families, including the Vanderbilts and Astors, donate generously.
1889 -- Sixty-eight designs are submitted to trustees but are not revealed to the public because some architects object.
1891 -- Trustees choose design, by Heins & La Farge, that combines Gothic exterior details with Byzantine and Romanesque interior.
1892 -- Trustees demand larger church with more Gothic elements, and order it to be built on an east-west, rather than a north-south axis citing Episcopalian doctrine that requires apse, or rear of the cathedral, to face east into the rising sun. Thus, front of cathdral will not face south onto 110th Street, and will not be visible from downtown. It will face west onto Amsterdam Avenue, and be visible to far fewer people. Cornerstone laid on Dec. 27, St. John's Day.
1893 -- Construction starts, and stops when soft stone is discovered where bedrock had been expected. Talk of moving the cathedral a block south is dismissed because trustees believe that moving a cornerstone is a bad omen. Three years and at least a half-million dollars are spent excavating soft stone and pouring concrete.
1907 -- The architect George Heins, dies. His partner, Christopher Grant La Farge, stays on as work is finished on choir and crossing.
1909 -- "Temporary" dome built over crossing with special tiles created by Rafael Guastavino, a Spanish immigrant. His company finishes in just 15 weeks, without using support structures.
1911 -- Apse, choir, crossing and first two chapels consecrated, April 19. A month later, trustees remove La Farge and hire Ralph Adams Cram, who sets out to totally "Gothicize" the cathedral and eradicate any sign of original Byzantine design. Building fund is depleted.
1914 -- With a donation from J.P. Morgan, huge Cathedral House is completed, consisting of the Bishop's House and Deanery.
1916 -- Cathedral construction resumes in May but stops in November when money again runs out. World War I and continuing financial problems postpone construction until 1924.
1925 -- A wealthy lawyer, Franklin D. Roosevelt, begins major fund-raising campaign. Work begins on baptistry, nave, Women's Transept and west facade.
1941 -- Expanded cathedral dedicated, Nov. 30. One week later, Japanese bomb Pearl Harbor, and work on cathedral stops again and does not resume for 40 years.
1978 -- Dean James Parks Morton begins stone-cutting apprentice program for south tower and later announces design competition for south transept. Winning design is not built.
1982 -- Construction resumes on south tower.
1992 -- Stone-cutting program is ended. Construction on south tower is stopped after only 50 feet, a small portion, is built.
1996 -- Dean Harry H. Pritchett Jr. replaces Dean Morton, who retires. Dean Pritchett begins focusing on preservation of existing cathedral, rather than additional construction.

HEADLINE: Down in the Valley, a Heated Economy Cools Just a Bit

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 10

 BODY:
Silicon Valley's surging economy slowed during 1998, stung in part by the Asian economic crisis, according to an annual report that tracks the health of the nation's leading high-technology center.
Silicon Valley added 19,400 jobs last year, compared with 62,000 in 1997, and exports from the region declined for the first time in eight years, according to the 1999 Index of Silicon Valley, which was released today. 
 The report, which is compiled by Joint Venture: Silicon Valley Network Inc., a coalition of corporate and civic organizations, shows that the region has continued to grow but that some of the remarkable start-up fever, a trademark of the area, has ratcheted back. Initial public offerings, which peaked at 73 in 1996, fell to 32 in 1998, and commercial vacancies, which have been at historic lows, inched up slightly, by more than a percentage point, from the previous year.
Despite some signs of slowdown and a long recession that has gripped the semiconductor equipment industry, which is centered in the Valley, there were still signs indicating that the area remains a remarkably robust economic region.
For example, the real average wage in the area rose 2 percent last year, to $49,060, and real per-capita income continued to rise at a rate faster than that of the nation as a whole. Quick-growing companies, or "gazelles," increased to 92 from 64, largely on the strength of the explosion in Internet commerce. And the amount of venture capital invested in Silicon Valley grew 14 percent, to $3.3 billion.
The slowing of the growth rate in the area was not viewed as entirely bad by the researchers who track the region's economic and quality-of-life trends.
"You can say we've gone back to a more normal growth rate," said Douglas Henton, president of Collaborative Economics in Palo Alto, Calif., which prepared the report for Joint Venture. "The Valley's long boom has put incredible pressure on the environment and on housing and transportation."
For the first time, the report included data that compare the region's productivity in specific industries with the rest of the country. Measured in terms of value added per employee, Silicon Valley workers in the computer and communications industries generated $250,000 for each employee, compared with slightly less than $100,000 for the average United States worker. Valley workers also sharply outpaced average rates in the semiconductor industry and in software.
"We're getting a tremendous amount of productivity," Mr. Henton said.
Despite the continued strong growth of the Valley economy, Joint Venture officials noted some signs of inequality and a failure to meet future educational needs.
For example, from 1991 to 1997, the report shows that real income fell 8 percent for households in the bottom fifth of income distribution. At the same time, real income rose 19 percent for households in the top fifth of the income pyramid.
Moreover, the high school graduation rate, which is now at 70 percent, has been slipping in the last five years; the graduation rate for Hispanic students stands at 56 percent.
"The new economy, which is more and more diverse, and the new demographics are not intersecting," said Ruben Barrales, president and chief executive of Joint Venture. "You have Hispanic and black kids who are not participating, and we're looking at an unsustainable scenario right now."
Transportation and housing also continue to be issues that plague the area. Last year, 31 percent of the freeway miles in Santa Clara County received the worst possible congestion rate, up from 26 percent in 1997.
Despite the fact that Silicon Valley is considered to be the most wired region of the country, only 52 percent of its residents have access to E-mail. That falls to less than 30 percent for those households with incomes of less than $40,000.

Silicon Graphics Bets On New Work Stations
After three years of declining fortunes, Silicon Graphics is placing a big bet today as it introduces a line of work stations built around Intel chips and Microsoft software.
While analysts like the new machines, nearly all remain neutral on Silicon Graphics' stock, saying that the company has yet to show that it can return to sustainable growth and profitability. Given Silicon Graphics' history of introducing brilliant new technology only to fumble on product delivery, it is perhaps not surprising that analysts are taking a wait-and-see attitude.

The Katharine Graham of Japan
Sawako Noma, 55, the president and chief executive of Kodansha, Japan's largest publishing company, is often compared to Katharine Graham, the former publisher of The Washington Post. Like Mrs. Graham, Mrs. Noma took control of a family company, in the face of some resistance, after her husband died. Unlike Mrs. Graham, Mrs. Noma took charge of an empire of 1,173 employees, 54 magazines, a newspaper, and book companies in Japan, the United States and Europe. C15.
 
Growth Slowing in Silicon Valley
Silicon Valley's surging economy slowed during 1998, stung in part by the Asian economic crisis, according to an annual report that tracks the health of the nation's leading high-technology center. The region added 19,400 jobs last year, compared with 62,000 in 1997, and exports declined. C13.
 
Industry Could Pay a Price for HDTV
As several companies announce plans to sell high-definition television sets at much lower prices, in some cases for less than half of what the cheapest sets cost only last fall, some executives are worried that the prices may be too low and will threaten the industry's profitability in the short term.

Preview of 2000 Goes Well
Because many computer programs look a full 52 weeks ahead, many users had feared that the advent of this year might cause problems as computers encountered the Year 2000 problem for the first time. Although there were a few mishaps last week -- some older equipment in New York could not produce 00 on auto inspection stickers so chose 91 instead, for example -- the disruptions seemed to be isolated.

The Kay Graham of Japan's Media Industry

BYLINE: By SUZANNE CHARLE 

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
In a wood-paneled room rich with Persian carpets in the sedate Bunkyo-ku district, Sawako Noma, 55, sat forward as she offered a visitor coffee. Wearing a neat gray suit with knee-length skirt, her short hair neatly coiffured, her crossed ankles leading to sensible low heels, Mrs. Noma looked to be the prototypical Japanese housewife: demure, gracious, unprepossessing.
Which is exactly what Mrs. Noma was until 1987, when her husband died and she took over the reins of Kodansha Ltd., Japan's largest publishing company. 
 "I had no editorial experience, no schooling in business," she said. Her resume bears out her words. The first entry, after higher education (Seisen Women's University) reads: June 1987 -- President and C.E.O., Kodansha Ltd.
She is, some say, the Katharine Graham of Japan's media industry. The busts guarding the fireplace in a room of the corporate headquarters are those of her grandfather, Seiji Noma, who started the company in 1909, and her grandmother who ran the company for a time. But to make the analogy complete, one might have to throw in Random House for good measure. As head of Kodansha, Mrs. Noma reigns over an empire of 1,173 employees, 54 magazines, a newspaper, and book companies in Japan, the United States and Europe that published 2,576 new titles in 1997.
Like her counterpart at The Washington Post, Mrs. Noma met with some resistance when she assumed power. "Kodansha tends to attract some very smart, very arrogant, very hidebound people -- extremely well-paid men who see themselves as creme de la creme," said a publishing executive who insisted on not being identified. "There was a tremendous war -- rather like the Heike-Genji war," he said, referring to Japan's 12th-century civil war. "The Nomas had become weak, because there was no male heir ready to assume power."
Mrs. Noma graciously but firmly skirted any suggestion of rebellion, saying only, "I think everybody thought the president had to be a man." But she said her son, Yoshinibu, was only 18 years old at the time, a university freshman. "I didn't want to sacrifice his youth," she said, adding that she wanted him and her three daughters to be able to experience life and make their own mistakes. At the same time, she felt a sense of duty to the family "It was my obligation to become president," she said.
Listening to her speak, it is clear that she also relished the chance to break out of her sheltered existence. "My curiosity was stronger than any fear," she said.
"I didn't say anything," Mrs. Noma recalled of her first year on the job. "I just watched and found out how things were run. Then I started making suggestions."
Her suggestions have won her respect inside and outside her company, and business analysts credit her with Kodansha's success. (In 1996, World Business, an Asian business magazine, selected her as one of the world's 50 most prominent businesswomen). In the decade since she has taken over, Kodansha has solidified its position as the No. 1 publishing company in Japan. Corporate sales in 1997 topped 200 billion yen ($1.8 billion) -- a 32 percent increase over 1987, and a quite respectable figure considering that Japan has been in recession for the last seven years.
One of her first acts as president was to dump Penthouse Japan from the company's magazine roster. She approved the addition of a number of women's magazines to an already successful group. The new ones are Voce (which concentrates on beauty with a clever ad campaign featuring some of Japans most unattractive personalities, all made up), Vivi (aimed at women in their teens and 20's) and Mine (for independent young women, single or just married).
"The Japanese magazine business has been horrible since the bubble burst," said Robert Kirschenbaum, president of Pacific Press Service, a Tokyo photographers' agency. "But the women's magazines continue to do well."
The magazine stable -- which accounts for 64 percent of Kodansha's sales -- is broad, ranging from the respected literary magazine Gunzo, with a circulation of 20,000, to the comic magazine Shonen, 400 pages of tales of wild-eyed sushi chefs and crazed ninjas. Shonen is bought by 4.2 million preteen and teen-age boys and girls each week.
The book list is similarly varied, ranging from works by literary luminaries like the Nobel laureates Yasunari Kawabata and Kenzaburo Oe to children's books, including "Totto-chan: The Little Girl at the Window," which has sold 6.8 million copies.
Mrs. Noma has also continued to expand Kodansha's global reach by financing several literary awards -- including one for translations of Japanese literature -- and by publishing works of Japanese literature through Kodansha International and its subsidiary, Kodansha America.
Mrs. Noma's eldest daughter, Chikako Noma, who works as a senior editor for Kodansha America in New York, noted that the international division was more of a mission than a profit center. The mission has met with considerable success. The division has introduced English translations of the works of the Nobel laureates as well as those by younger writers, including "Norwegian Wood," by Haruki Murakami.
Perhaps most surprising, under Sawako Noma, the editors at Kodansha America have published original titles on American life, several of which have made it to best-seller lists. "Having Our Say," the stories of Sarah and A. Elizabeth Delany, two black sisters, sold 1.5 million copies and was on the New York Times best-seller list for 35 weeks (hardcopy) and 63 weeks (paperback, published by Dell).
No Western publishers have achieved such bicultural success, although the Japanese public has a voracious appetite for foreign books.
Sawako Noma and others point out that publishing is very different in Japan from what it is in the rest of the world, and the language barrier has proved to be a mighty fortress against foreign incursion, as would-be interlopers like Rupert Murdoch have learned.
Japanese publishers are also blessed with a public that is almost 100 percent literate.
"In America, there are a limited number of people who can be called readers," said Tetsu Shirai, deputy executive director of Kodansha International who headed Kodansha America in the 1980's. "In Japan, the ordinary citizen likes to read -- reading is seen as entertainment and has been since the 16th and 17th centuries. In America, there seems to be a psychological barrier for people to go to a bookstore. Here, it isn't uncommon, even in the smallest of towns, for people to set a date to meet at a bookstore."
Nonetheless, Japanese publishers are worried. Sales show that instead of buying books and magazines, young people are spending their money on cellular phones and computer games. Kodansha and other publishers are starting a campaign this spring to combat this trend.
And Sawako Noma signed off on the company's expansion into animated movie and video productions, based on its cartoon characters. "Akira," which stars a big-eyed character by the same name, became an instant classic, and "Ghost in the Shell" hit No. 1 in sales in its seventh week on the United States video charts in 1996.

HEADLINE: WB Succeeds By Serving Youth Alone

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER 

DATELINE: PASADENA, Calif., Jan. 10

 BODY:
Along with much of the audience and most of the profit, the confidence bordering on arrogance that once characterized the network television business has faded away this season.
But it is alive and well in at least one place, TV's youngest, hippest and increasingly only upwardly mobile address: the upstart would-be network known as WB. 
 Pointing to figures that make WB the only broadcast network to demonstrate ratings growth this season, company executives consider themselves already securely established as a legitimate fifth network, on track to turning a profit within two years, and in position to assume complete leadership among the youngest segment of adult TV viewers within five years.
And maybe, the two top WB executives said, the network might just even start scheduling more shows from Warner Brothers, the studio owned by its parent company, Time Warner -- if only the studio starts making shows good enough and hip enough to squeeze their way onto the roster that now includes such youth-oriented hits as "Buffy, the Vampire Slayer," "Dawson's Creek" and "Seventh Heaven."
"Warner Brothers just has to do a better job" developing shows with the youthful skew that WB requires, said Jamie Kellner, the chief executive of WB. Mr. Kellner and Susanne Daniels, the new president of WB's entertainment division, spoke at a session of the Television Critics' Association meeting here last week and in separate interviews later.
For WB, "broadcasting" is increasingly a misnomer because the network is unflinchingly dedicated to never becoming too broad for its own good. The model, as Mr. Kellner put it, is not what NBC has been for the last five years, the dominant network with a wide range of viewers, nor even what Fox would like to become, the leader with the large adult group of viewers up to the age of 49.
Radio is attractive as the new model, Mr. Kellner said, because radio companies have done increasingly well on Wall Street despite being highly fragmented and controlling extremely small slices of audience.
That looks to be the future of television networks as well, he said, adding, "If it's going to be a fragmented marketplace, make sure the one you're hanging onto is the most valuable one in terms of advertisers."
As WB sees it, what advertisers want is youth, more youth and nothing but the youth, and the network is searingly focused on giving them exactly that. Far from looking to expand its reach, to compete for wider segments of viewers, Mr. Kellner said, WB would stick to its youth orientation. "Our goal is to remain with a median age under 30 years of age," he said. "That is the long-term, set-in-stone goal for this network."
But at least one other goal when the network was established four years ago by the Warner television studio was that it would serve as the fallback distribution outlet for the programs the studio makes. Warner Brothers was concerned about the increasing effort by the networks that carried its programs, mostly NBC, owned by the General Electric Company, and ABC, a unit of the Walt Disney Company, to fill their schedules with shows they themselves owned. Subsequent schedules from those networks have begun to validate those concerns.
Mr. Kellner conceded that "vertical integration is going to happen in television," with networks relying more on shows delivered by the studios with which they are aligned.
Does that mean Warner Brothers will soon be restricted to producing shows exclusively filled with characters in their teens and early 20's?
Barry M. Meyer, the executive vice president of Warner Brothers, said he did not think so, because he could not envision a time when a network would be totally vertically integrated, locking out shows from any other studio. He conceded that the "landscape has changed a bit," with networks like NBC trying to compel studios to cede ownership to them on every show scheduled.
"But we are still producing older shows for CBS and a lot of shows for NBC," Mr. Meyer said. "If there is a major shift in the policies at these networks, then the whole industry is going to have to be re-evaluated."
In the meantime, Warner Brothers is more than happy with the success being built by WB, Mr. Meyer said. "How could we not be pleased?" he asked. "I don't think it's too strong a statement that the WB is redefining the business in a way, both in its economic model and the way they have niched themselves."
Still, for the moment at least, WB is hardly a conduit for Warner Brothers programs; only a few of its shows, and none of its high-profile hits, are provided by the Warner studio. Instead, WB's schedule is dotted with shows supplied by the Warner Brothers studio's main rivals, like Fox ("Buffy"), Disney ("Felicity"), Sony's Columbia unit ("Dawson's Creek") and Aaron Spelling's Spelling Entertainment Group("Seventh Heaven").
The WB connection has proved to be a windfall for these studios because in recent years shows on WB have sold re-run rights in syndication for very high prices. Ms. Daniels noted that after its first year, "Buffy" sold to the FX network for more than $1 million an episode.
Mr. Kellner said WB was under no obligation to favor Warner Brothers shows. The network is a partnership of Time Warner, the Tribune Company television stations group and his own company, Acme Broadcasting. "We're in this together," Mr. Kellner said, adding that if Time Warner and Tribune are unhappy with WB's executives, "they can fire us if they want to," but that while they're in place "we operate the business."
He said that "in our first two years we got no cooperation from the studio." Very few of the studio's producers generated programs for WB. Since then, he said, "more effort has been made." But he said, "Maybe there's a hex on us or something like that, but we've not been able to break through yet with Warner Brothers."
Mr. Kellner added: "We always said we were going to put on the best shows. It's their job to get some of their shows to be the best shows."
Ms. Daniels said she expected more Warner shows to start filtering to WB soon, after existing deals tying some of the best Warner Brothers producers to NBC and ABC run their course. She mentioned the team of Marta Kaufman, Kevin Bright and David Crane, the creators of "Friends"; Bruce Helford of "The Drew Carey Show," and John Wells of "E.R."
"The object of the business is to make money," Mr. Kellner said, describing the approach he believed Warner Brothers executives should apply to WB. "The younger you are in terms of the appeal of your programs, the higher the value in syndication."
Mr. Kellner contrasted WB's strategy for building a new network with that of Fox, where Mr. Kellner worked during its ascension in the late 1980's and early 1990's. The mistake Fox eventually made, both he and Ms. Daniels said, was to abandon its one-time identity as "the bad-boy network," as Ms. Daniels put it, in a quest to overtake NBC for command of the broader age group favored by many advertisers, viewers between the ages of 18 and 49.
Mr. Kellner said the push by Fox, a unit of the News Corporation, to acquire rights to the National Football League was a mistake because it signaled the end of a programming approach characterized by the philosophy "If you can see it somewhere else, it doesn't belong here."
Instead, football became hugely costly. "The Fox network is not profitable now," Mr. Kellner said,
For Fox, of course, this analysis flies in the face of the growth that acquiring football helped fuel, both in adding stronger affiliated stations and in gaining wider credibility for Fox as a full-fledged network.
Still, Mr. Kellner has a growing body of ratings results to back up his arguments. Of the six networks now competing in prime time, only WB has shown increases in viewing this year, about 10 percent for the season. More important for WB, whose early success came largely as a result of enormous viewing by teen-age girls, some of the most significant increases have been among viewers who qualify as young adults, those between the ages of 18 and 34.
Mr. Kellner said WB took in about $300 million in advance commitments from advertisers last spring, and he predicted the comparable figure will reach $450 million this year. Movie advertisers, particularly, have flocked to WB shows, looking for the young viewers that form the base audience for so many contemporary films.
So confidence -- yes, even arrogance -- is brimming over at WB.
"When we are the No. 1 network 18 to 34, we'll probably be the most profitable network in America," Mr. Kellner said. "That's our goal."

HEADLINE: One Nation, Unplugged;
The Titans of Wireless Are Tearing Down Regional Fences

BYLINE: By SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
George F. Schmitt, president of Omnipoint Communications, a small wireless phone carrier, recalls sitting in his kitchen in Montville, N.J., one morning last May with Omni, his pet blue and gold parrot, and hardly believing what he was hearing.
In a public conference call, top executives from the AT&T Corporation, the nation's biggest communications company, were explaining how they meant to rewrite the de facto rules for pricing wireless calls. Not only would AT&T do away with long-distance charges for wireless, but it said it would also end the additional "roaming" fees for using a phone when traveling to an area covered by a different company's network -- a charge that consumers had been resenting since the first mobile phones made their debut in the 1980's. 
 It certainly sounded like a great new cost-saving convenience for wireless customers. But the move also seemed such a drastic economic departure from the industry's conventional practices that Mr. Schmitt wondered how anyone -- even mighty AT&T -- could afford it.
"I stayed home so I could listen to the call that morning, and I was sitting there thinking, 'How can they do this?' " Mr. Schmitt said in an interview last week. "After the call was over I sat there for a long time with Omni, but until I saw their ads I think I really underestimated it. They did an outstanding job of changing who would use AT&T and pulling customers in."
Mr. Schmitt may have had only his parrot to keep him company that morning, but he was hardly alone. It took many communications experts time to realize that by introducing the plan that day that it called Digital One Rate, AT&T had changed the ground rules of the wireless business in the United States.
For some, the depth of that shift may not have become clear until Dec 31, when reports emerged that the Bell Atlantic Corporation, the nation's No. 1 local phone company, was trying to acquire the leader in wireless, the Airtouch Corporation, based in San Francisco, for around $45 billion. Bell Atlantic had apparently decided that being merely the third-biggest wireless carrier in the United States was not enough and that it was prepared to dilute its future earnings to acquire Airtouch's network.
And last week it became clear that Bell Atlantic was not alone in coveting Airtouch. Vodafone Group P.L.C., Britain's largest mobile phone carrier, also jumped into the bidding. And yesterday reports emerged that British Telecom P.L.C. was also considering making an offer. MCI Worldcom Inc. weighed a bid last week, but decided to pass.
"Given the way the market is moving, there is certainly virtue in having a national footprint, whether you achieve that through ownership or through partnership," said Jonathan Marshall, an Airtouch spokesman.
Bell Atlantic declined to comment.
Whatever the outcome of the Airtouch bidding war, analysts do not expect that takeover to be the industry's last.
In other parts of the communications industry, it is an old story: You need scale to thrive, and perhaps even to survive. But in the wireless sector it is being told these days for the first time. As AT&T and other major players, like Nextel and Sprint, use their national footprints to create leverage in the marketplace, smaller, regional carriers like Omnipoint and even the Baby Bells are feeling the pinch.
For consumers, the carriers' move to a national battlefield means lower rates, better service and broader coverage. For the carriers, however, the changes can mean slimmer profit margins, tougher competition and a drive to find partners with deep pockets.
"The little guy is getting squeezed," said John Bensche, a wireless analyst at Lehman Brothers, who acknowledges that he also initially underestimated the impact of AT&T's new plan. "AT&T sort of exploded the market with One Rate. For the regional guys it's going to be hard; it's going to be very hard. You can make money. You're not going to go bankrupt. But you may be doomed to sort of subpar returns. So I think some of these guys are going to merge."
Besides reflecting the impact of national competition, the looming shake-out may be an inevitable consequence of the sheer proliferation of wireless carriers.
Until a few years ago, almost every American metropolitan market had only two cellular carriers. But in 1996 the Federal Communications Commission auctioned rights to a big swath of frequencies, and that led to the creation in 1997 of as many as four new wireless carriers per market in some places. What was good for competition, however, has not always been good for the carriers' books.
The problem is that a new wireless carrier must spend millions, sometimes billions, of dollars to build an extensive network before signing up a single customer. The competition, meanwhile, may be able to charge lower rates because its network is already in place. Or the new entrant often finds itself building alongside a giant like AT&T or Sprint that can either pay for the construction out of the cash flow generated from its existing long-distance business or can afford to borrow billions at low interest rates.
"We're clearly seeing a move to where more market share is being captured by national services," said Andrew Sukawaty, chief executive of the Sprint PCS venture. Sprint PCS is not yet among the top 10 wireless carriers, but in the 1996 auctions, it bought licenses covering almost the entire country.
"This has become a national financing game," Mr. Sukawaty said, "and it's hard to see how the local and small-business players will be able to make it."
In some ways, Mr. Schmitt's Omnipoint -- which offers service in New York City, elsewhere in the Northeast and in Miami -- provides a good example of the challenges facing small wireless carriers. Pressed for cash, Omnipoint was able to secure $375 million in new financing late last year, mostly from companies with which it already does business, Siemens of Germany and Northern Telecom of Canada. Nonetheless, the company is canvassing foreign communications companies in search of someone to buy a big equity stake or perhaps even to acquire the whole company.
Still, Omnipoint is unusual among small carriers in being able to secure additional financing at a crucial stage. Other carriers, like Pocket Communications, which owned a license for the Chicago area, have filed for bankruptcy protection.
No wonder some small regional carriers are forming partnerships in hopes of expanding their service areas and pooling marketing costs. One such group is the GSM Alliance. The alliance takes its name from G.S.M., or global system for mobile communications, a digital wireless technology that is used widely in Europe and Asia but has not become as popular in the United States. Among the GSM Alliance members, which have banded together to form roaming agreements, are Omnipoint, Aerial Communications, Powertel, Western Wireless and Microcell of Canada.
But the GSM Alliance, while far from a failure, has not yet made much of a dent in the marketplace. Some small-company executives involved in the group say that it is being held back by the caution of two Baby Bell members, Bell South and SBC Communications. Those executives said the Bell companies, attuned to regulatory concerns, have been reluctant to back initiatives, like collaborative pricing plans, that were proposed by other members of the group.
But people close to the Bells note that one company's foot-dragging may be another's compliance with antitrust laws. SBC, for example, is still trying to gain regulatory approval of its planned acquisition of the regional phone company Ameritech, which recently put its Chicago wireless system up for sale to help address regulators' concerns. That system should fetch more than $2 billion.
Although many people on Wall Street and in the communications industry expect some of the GSM members eventually to merge as they try to expand their coverage areas, a role may remain for regional carriers in the wireless business. Earle Mauldin, who oversees the BellSouth wireless operations, said that only about a quarter of his company's wireless customers roam outside their home markets. And Stanley T. Sigman, who runs SBC's wireless business, said only 4 percent of his customers roam outside SBC's territory.
But for AT&T, with its national presence, those regional arguments do not hold up.
"If you were paying 80 cents a minute when you're on the road making a long-distance call, would you roam?" said Dan Hesse, president of AT&T's wireless operation. "It's a chicken-and-egg thing."
And even some of the regional carriers acknowledge the growing allure of a national reach. "Most people are calling a few towns over to their mom and dad or their place of work or where their kids go to school," said John W. Stanton, chairman of Western Wireless, one of the larger regional carriers, and chairman of the Cellular Telephone Industry Association.
"There will clearly be some regional players playing roles in the market," Mr. Stanton said. "There will also be a few national players that will have the vast majority of subscribers."

HEADLINE: Reno's Tenure Sets a Record This Century

BYLINE: By DAVID JOHNSTON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 10

 BODY:
Attorney General Janet Reno is set on Monday to become the longest-serving Attorney General of this century, surpassing the record set 60 years ago by Homer S. Cummings, an Attorney General in the Administration of Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
Ms. Reno's longevity at the Justice Department is notable because she got the job in March 1993 almost by accident when President Clinton hurriedly plucked her from her job as the elected prosecutor for Dade County, in Florida, after his first two nominations for Attorney General collapsed in embarrassing controversies over household workers. 
 Ms. Reno, 60, is unlikely to break the record for longest time in the post. That is held by William Wirt, who served for 11 years over the Administrations of James Monroe and John Quincy Adams, from Nov. 13, 1817, to March 3, 1829.
Mr. Cummings held the post from March 4, 1933, to Jan. 2, 1939, serving as one of Mr. Roosevelt's chief legal advisers during the Depression banking crisis, and helping to create the New Deal recovery program.
Mr. Cummings's insider role at the White House serves as a sharp contrast to the chilly gulf that has often separated Ms. Reno and Mr. Clinton, whose aides have complained about Ms. Reno's crusty independence each time (five so far) that she has referred cases involving Cabinet officials to independent counsels.
But the independent counsel statute has also indirectly helped Ms. Reno keep her job. Largely because removing her would seem blatantly motivated by political pique, Mr. Clinton has never dared to try.
Ms. Reno's tenure got off to a potentially disastrous start when she approved a tear gas assault in April 1993 by the Federal Bureau of Investigation on an armed religious cult barricaded at a compound near Waco, Tex. More than 80 people died in a resulting fire. Ms. Reno accepted responsibility for the tear gas assault, but said the deaths were caused solely by David Koresh, the Branch Davidian leader, who died in the fire.
In legal circles, Ms. Reno has never been regarded among the giants of the Attorney General's office. Nor has she compiled a record of aggressive initiatives like Robert F. Kennedy's efforts on civil rights or organized crime.
Still, in a period when crime rates have been falling, Ms. Reno has been an advocate for law enforcement and measures against youth violence and violence against women.
In the Justice Department her stewardship has elicited criticism and praise. Her wooden manner, lack of command of some issues and inability to set priorities have infuriated subordinates and threatened to erode her authority over a burgeoning department of more than 100,000 employees.
But Ms. Reno remains a solitary figure of propriety in the frequently troubled Clinton Administration. She has many admirers within the Justice Department, particularly among lower-level employees. They regard her as a relentlessly honest and rigorously fair public official who has softened the aloof image of the office.
Still, a joke going around the department suggested how some aides are ambivalent about Ms. Reno's tenure. As the joke goes, one employee says to another, "Did you know that Janet Reno has just broken the record for the longest serving Attorney General in the last 150 years?"
His colleague replies, "I thought she'd been here longer."

HEADLINE: In the Nation's Capital, Historians Leave Impeachment for the Future

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 10

 BODY:
With a contemporary constitutional drama going on just a few miles away, historians flocked to the nation's capital last week to discuss topics like the dilemma of the South Asian intellectual and acoustics in early America.
So why did the 113th annual meeting of the American Historical Association include nary a word (officially, anyhow) on impeachment even as it explored long-ago violence in the politics of North Carolina and Kentucky and the French influence on Cairo in the 19th century? 
 "These programs are prepared months in advance," Prof. Eric Foner of Columbia University, the association's president-elect, said on Friday without a trace of defensiveness. "What is esoteric to one person may be essential to another."
Professor Foner is an expert on the Civil War and the Reconstruction era that occasioned the last Presidential impeachment, that of Andrew Johnson in 1868, and he emphasized that the several thousand historians gathered here Thursday through today were very much interested in the events unfolding at the Capitol.
"This is being discussed a great deal in the corridors," the professor said. "And I can tell you that very few historians here feel that the charges against President Clinton rise to the level of impeachable offenses."
The practicalities of scheduling aside, some historians offered higher-minded reasons for not jumping into scholarly explorations of the current impeachment. When the extent of Mr. Clinton's troubles began to emerge, there was a lot of discussion among historians, face-to-face and via electronic mail, Prof. Richard Jensen of the University of Illinois at Chicago recalled.
"It was totally politicized," Professor Jensen said, "so we stopped talking about it." At least for a while.
To politicize a subject, he said, is to risk contaminating it, at least when one hopes to approach the subject as a scholar in quest of the elusive truth. Far better for historians, he said, to let the subject cool a bit first, much as the Senate is supposed to be the saucer that cools the tea, legislatively speaking.
Prof. Carole Shammas of the University of Southern California, whose speciality is economic history, tried to foreclose any discussion of impeachment by jokingly throwing up her hands. "I don't know anything about Monica Lewinsky," she said.
More seriously, she wondered whether the Clinton impeachment would help set off another sea change in American politics: a reaction against the growing power of conservatives, much as there was a backlash against liberal causes three decades ago. (A historian, not a fortune-teller, she did not try to answer her own question.)
Michael Brose, a graduate student at the University of Pennsylvania, specializes in Asian history but said he and those who share his field have been caught up of late in the impeachment: "It's a big topic, especially coming here to Washington." Soon, he said, the impeachment will be grist for scholars.
And Ronald J. Granieri, an assistant professor at Furman University in Greenville, S.C., said he and some of his colleagues have concluded that President Clinton is the victim of "a political set-up job."
Mr. Granieri, whose speciality is European history, said he thought that Mr. Clinton was doing a good job, basically. Like many Americans, Mr. Granieri cited the healthy economy.
Professor Foner, the incoming president of the largest professional historical organization in the United States with about 15,000 members, conceded that some topics on the agenda could seem arcane to an outsider.
"We are, by definition, talking to ourselves," he said. Talking about the Argentine fingerprint system, the Neapolitan Revolution of 1799 and homemaking in fascist colonial Libya, to name topics that seem not only outside history's mainstream but away from its tiniest tributaries.
Such topics, and many others, explore the stuff of life throughout the world, Professor Foner said. They are a reminder, if any is needed, that history is so much more than battlefields and governmental intrigue and the deeds and misdeeds of the powerful.
Next year in Chicago, he said, there may be room on the annual meeting's agenda for a discussion of impeachment -- assuming that Mr. Clinton's fate is decided by then.
"We're not political pundits," he said without a trace of smugness. "We like to know how something turns out before we analyze it."

HEADLINE: Mexico City Journal;
Cocaine Doesn't Just 'Transit': Some of It Seeps

BYLINE: By GINGER THOMPSON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY

 BODY:
If he could take control of the millions of dollars Mexico spends each year to combat drug trafficking, Miguel Gonzalez Espinosa would spend a little less of it on high-tech, heavily armed operations at airports and along the border, aimed at stopping the flow of drugs from Colombia on their way to the United States.
Mr. Gonzalez, who proudly calls himself a recovering alcoholic, directs a small drug rehabilitation center in the downtrodden neighborhood that surrounds the city's Basilica de Guadalupe. He sees firsthand the toll taken by a less-talked-about, but increasingly damaging problem: the rise in drug abuse -- especially cocaine and crack -- among Mexican youth. 
 In just the last two months, his residential treatment center, which relies entirely on private donations, has taken in 12 new clients and is running above capacity, with 40 residents.
One of them is Gloria Acevedo, 15, who had been living on the streets for two years, stealing and working as a prostitute to support her cocaine habit. Marco Antonio Salazar, 19, arrived stoned after he beat up his sister and was kicked out by his parents. And an addiction to crack led Isaac Perez, 22, to quit his job, sell all his belongings and steal cars.
"We are in a drug crisis up to our necks," said Mr. Gonzalez, president of the Fundacion Dr. Sergio Berumen, the residential treatment program, named for a philanthropist who gave seed money for the center. "When traffickers cannot get their drugs across the border, they sell it here."
Mexico has been recognized for years as a major transit station for drugs. More than half of the cocaine smuggled into the United States passes through Mexico, as well as much of the heroin and marijuana.
At a United Nations meeting about the drug trade last summer, President Ernesto Zedillo characterized his country's crisis as one that is generated by drug consumer nations, especially the United States. There are new signs, however, that the number of Mexican consumers is on the rise.
A 1997 report by the Ministry of Health says that in the last six years cocaine use has quadrupled among Mexicans aged from 12 to 19. Among patients at Government-run treatment centers in Mexico City, whose numbers have increased from 4,500 to 13,500 in the last six years, marijuana remains the drug of choice for most adolescents, health officials report. But cocaine, particularly crack, ranked second -- before cheaper choices like glue and paint thinner.
The Government has responded to the problem with increased funding to its own drug treatment centers. It has also created a public service campaign called Live Without Drugs. The campaign includes radio and television announcements, educational programs in schools and a Web site that answers questions about drug abuse.
In cities across the country, including Culiacan, Ciudad Victoria, San Luis Potosi and Hermosillo, the police have proposed a program known as Operation Backpack, which would allow them to search students for drugs and weapons, although some parents have expressed reservations. Parents have started community patrols around school playgrounds and parks.
Compared with the voracious consumption of drugs in the United States, Mexico's drug problem remains small. But to Mr. Gonzalez even one drug-addicted child is too many. "Every day I see how drugs are destroying young people," Mr. Gonzalez said.
As in the United States, drug abuse in Mexico is spreading fastest in poor communities where unemployment is high and education levels are low, Mr. Gonzalez said.
Ms. Acevedo, a flirtatious girl who dyes her hair strawberry blond and wears sparkly pink lipstick, ran away from a shattered family. She said her mother, a waitress, and her father, a street vendor, began using drugs when she was just an infant. Both would stay away from home for days at a time, leaving her to beg for food from neighbors for herself and her three younger brothers.
At 11, she said, she began stealing her parents' drugs and hiding in the cluster of fruit trees in her backyard to get high.
"The first time I ever got high, I thought, this is what life is supposed to be," she said. "I had found something that would fill the emptiness."
She ran away at 12 and lived in train stations or abandoned offices. Last October she nearly died from an overdose.
"All I wanted was drugs," she recalled. "Suffering for me was when I didn't have anything to get to make me high."
When it opened 10 years ago, the Fundacion Dr. Sergio Berumen primarily served alcoholic adults, who needed a place to dry out so they could go home to their families. During the last five years, Mr. Gonzalez said, younger people started coming for help, and they were addicted to drugs, not alcohol.
Today, Mr. Gonzalez said, more than 80 percent of the residents are drug addicts between 13 and 20. The white metal front door is almost always left open, Mr. Gonzalez said. Residents are free to leave anytime they please.
Group meetings are held five times a day for the residents to talk with one another about their addictions and any other distress.
At a recent meeting, Mr. Salazar spoke from the podium for more than 15 minutes. This time of year is especially hard for him, he said, echoing the feelings of many in the room.
It hurt, he said, that he could not celebrate the holidays with his 8-month-old son.
"I want to be with my family," he said. "But I am afraid of what I would do if someone offered me drugs.
"I wonder if I will ever feel ready to go home."

HEADLINE: Iraq's Parliament Puts Off Vote of Defiance Against U.N.

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: CAIRO, Jan. 10

 BODY:
After more than a month of rising defiance, the Iraqi Government postponed a vote today in which its Parliament had appeared ready to take further steps along a collision course with its Western foes.
Instead, Parliament issued only a mild statement critical of the American-led air strikes against Iraq last month. Those attacks prompted calls from some legislators for measures that would have been a direct challenge to the United Nations. 
 No reason was given for the postponement, which came at the end of a special two-day session. But the legislative body is an instrument of President Saddam Hussein's Government, and it appears that Baghdad decided skirt a further confrontation.
Only hours before today's vote, a majority of the 250-member Parliament appeared ready to formally reject several of the United Nations resolutions that were imposed on Iraq after it invaded Kuwait in 1990.
Instead, Parliament adopted a resolution calling only for Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, which have served as bases for Western military operations against Iraq, to pay reparations for the damage caused by the air strikes last month.
Still, members of Parliament said consideration of tougher measures, including the possible repudiation of Iraq's border with Kuwait, could resume by the end of the month.
And the legislators did reinforce the Government's rejection of Western-imposed no-flight zones over large parts of the country.
Until today the Iraqi reaction to the American and British air strikes followed an increasingly confrontational path. Since the attacks ended on Dec. 19, the Iraqi Government has zeroed in its air defenses on American warplanes and called on Arabs to rise up against governments in the region aligned with the United States.
Such steps have prompted renewed warnings from the West, including a statement this weekend by Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, on an official visit to Kuwait, that warned of further military action if Iraq once again appeared to be threatening its neighbors.
By setting aside a more confrontational message, Iraq may have been trying to limit hostility from the Arab world.
Since the air strikes ended last month, Iraqi frustration over a lack of Arab backing has been mounting. While Arab governments remain opposed to the air strikes, they have more than at any time since the Persian Gulf war of 1991 expressed outright hostility toward Mr. Hussein, whom they distinguish from the Iraqi people.
A meeting of Arab foreign ministers has been scheduled for Jan. 24, and the tensions over Iraq are expected to be high on the agenda.
Despite their recent criticism of Mr. Hussein, even some countries critical of Iraq have hinted that they might use the session to push for an easing of the economic sanctions that the United Nations has imposed on Iraq since its invasion of Kuwait.
Reports in several Saudi-owned newspapers said today that Saudi Arabia was ready to press for such a move as long as military pressure against Baghdad continued.
Foreign Minister Mohammed Said al-Sahaf of Iraq sought at a news conference this evening in Baghdad to make the most of such sentiment.
He called on Saudi Arabia to end its cooperation with the American and British enforcement of the no-flight zone over southern Iraq, and on Arab countries to lift economic sanctions unilaterally at the coming meeting.

HEADLINE: Vice President Sounds Presidential Themes

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 10

 BODY:
While still months away from officially declaring himself a Presidential candidate, Vice President Al Gore is scheduled to announce a series of initiatives this week that his aides say will be major themes of his campaign.
On Monday, Mr. Gore will unveil the Administration's budget request for community planning programs. On Tuesday, he will propose tax incentives for education and job training programs. On Wednesday, he will award Empowerment Zone grants and speak to a Jewish group in New York in support of the Israeli peace process. On Thursday and Friday, he will be the host for officials from 45 countries at a conference to promote open trade. 
 These issues may sound familiar, as they have been hallmarks of the Clinton Administration. But as the backbone of Mr. Gore's campaign, they clearly define him as an extension of Mr. Clinton, a calculation that suggests the Vice President is confident voters will reward him for the Administration's successes but not blame him for the President's personal failings.
But by offering only mild criticism of the behavior threatening to drive Mr. Clinton from office, Mr. Gore seems willing to endure some criticism. Already, two Republican Presidential hopefuls, Lamar Alexander, the former Governor of Tennessee, and Senator John McCain of Arizona, have denounced Mr. Gore as an apologist for the President.
"Even though the electoral clock is ticking, we are still more than two years away from the term of the next President," Mr. Gore said today in an interview. "So while political speculation is understandable and omnipresent, for my part, I'm going to continue to focus on my work as Vice President and put off for quite some time into the future a formal announcement of my candidacy."
Mr. Gore's aides say he is betting that with the stars aligned as they are -- a robust national economy, an enormously popular President and a Clinton-Gore fund-raising apparatus already tapping Democratic donors for the $20 million Mr. Gore expects to raise by December -- the Vice President risks nothing by not stepping out from behind Mr. Clinton, even with the impeachment trial set to begin this week.
That means that people waiting to learn more about Al Gore, the Presidential aspirant, had better settle in for Al Gore, the Vice President, for many months to come. For now, he is not willing to articulate so much as a sentence about his own personal values or priorities, beyond the work at hand.
"The question is, how I define my campaign and myself as a candidate," Mr. Gore said. "With all due respect, I would like to defer a discussion of my candidacy until I have formally announced as a candidate. I am well aware that the work which the President and I do has all manner of political resonance, and that's as it should be in this system. But I'm going to focus on the substance of that work and on the impact it has on the American people."
Mr. Gore's unwillingness to begin defining himself as a candidate may have had an impact at least on potential opponents. Two potential Democratic contenders, Senators Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, have decided not to run, and it appears more likely that Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House Democratic leader, will not try.
Bill Bradley, the former Senator from New Jersey, has formed an exploratory committee. And Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts and the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson say they are considering a run.
But none seems to have the fund-raising power or grass-roots organization that Mr. Gore has built in recent years as an active campaigner for other Democrats. He has built especially strong contacts in the four states that will have a large influence in producing the party nominees by virtue of their early caucuses and primaries: Iowa, New Hampshire, New York and California.
The impeachment trial remains an uncertainty. Even so, Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, said today in an interview that he did not believe that anything that happened to Mr. Clinton "would have any effect at all on the Vice President."
Others are not entirely sure.
"My guess is that he would not much be affected," Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, one of the first Democrats to criticize the President's moral judgment, said in an interview. "But I'm only guessing."

HEADLINE: THE TRIAL OF THE PRESIDENT: POLITICAL MEMO;
Focus on Impeachment Casts a Shadow on the Goals of Both Parties

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON and JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 10

 BODY:
In a city that seems to be all impeachment all the time, the question now is whether there is any hope of Congress's working with the Clinton Administration to address the full plate of other issues facing the country.
Social Security and Medicare need to be overhauled before they are driven into bankruptcy by the aging of the baby boom generation. Military leaders say the Pentagon needs more money to insure national security. 
 Both parties have ideas for improving schools. Republicans are pressing for big tax cuts, Democrats for more spending on health and child care. The shortcomings in the laws governing political fund-raising remain unaddressed.
Democrats and Republicans alike have powerful motivations to prove to the electorate that they have not been consumed by the impeachment process, especially given that the Senate trial of President Clinton now seems likely to stretch into next month and perhaps longer.
In that sense, some members of both parties think the White House and the Republican leadership in Congress will be eager to strike deals on big issues like Social Security once the impeachment trial is over.
"This trial has obviously knocked everything off the agenda for a period of time, but as a practical matter, this is a time of year when Congress does very little anyway," said Senator Judd Gregg, a Republican from New Hampshire.
"It could end up having a positive impact because after we come out of the trial there's going to be a desire on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue to show constructive action," Mr. Gregg said. "The issue that's sitting there ready to go is Social Security."
But such an outcome presumes that there is enough trust between two parties who have been savaging each other for months that they will be willing to wade hand-in-hand into issues that are easy targets for demagoguery. Trust may prove to be an especially scarce commodity since Republicans and Democrats are thinking as much in terms of positioning themselves for the 2000 elections as in terms of what they might accomplish legislatively this year.
"Bitter partisanship in the past has not prevented us from getting things done," said Representative Jim Kolbe, a Republican from Arizona. "We did it with welfare reform and with the balanced budget agreement. But both sides will have to believe they are getting something from it. If both sides think they're better off by doing nothing and blaming the other, we'll get nowhere."
A complex and subtle political calculus is at work. Mr. Clinton would clearly like to leave a legacy of accomplishment to offset the stain of impeachment. But doing so -- whether on big issues like Social Security and health care or on specific programs like building more classrooms -- will require him to compromise with Republicans, a prospect that is not appealing to many Congressional Democrats.
Liberal Democrats in particular think their best chance of recapturing control of the House in 2000 is to paint Republicans as right-wing zealots who have accomplished nothing of importance to the American people. The dynamic could also be affected in the increasingly unlikely event that Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader, chooses to challenge Vice President Al Gore for the party's Presidential nomination, leading to an open battle between the party's centrist and liberal factions.
"The question for a lot of Congressional Democrats is why we should do anything to help build a record of accomplishment for the Republican Congress," a senior Democratic aide in the House said.
Among Republicans, too, there are widely varying views on how to proceed at a time when their party's standing in the polls is plummeting.
In the Senate, 13 of the 19 Republicans up for re-election in 2000 are from states Mr. Clinton carried in 1996, suggesting some willingness to move to the center. Senate Republicans are increasingly eager to reach a deal on Social Security so they can turn the agenda to an issue they believe is the most proven political winner available to them, tax cuts.
In the House, Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois has promised to steer Republicans in a more pragmatic direction and to work with Democrats. But any substantive compromises he makes are likely to expose him to the same furious response from his right wing that helped bring down Newt Gingrich.
"Denny Hastert has got to be able to tell the far right of his party to knock it off, that he's going to govern from the center," said Representative Robert T. Matsui, a Democrat from California. "It's possible, though, that if he tries he'll get run over."
On the other hand, Mr. Matsui said, if the Republican leadership and the White House prove willing to work with each other, "the left of our party won't be happy because then you'll see bills getting passed."
There is also some question as to how much pressure the electorate will put on Washington to get down to business. Stephen Moore of the Cato Institute, a research organization influential with conservative Republicans, said that with the economy humming along nicely and the country lacking any sense of urgency about big policy changes, the electorate may find gridlock in Washington to be an acceptable or even appealing outcome.
Still, Mr. Clinton, at least, is determined to show the voters an activist Administration at work.
"Will we rest on our laurels, become diverted in our energies, or keep working together?" Mr. Clinton asked in a speech in Detroit on Friday. "If we work together, there are no limits to 21st-century America."
White House officials continue to work on a wide variety of relatively small-bore policy initiatives to include in the budget proposal Mr. Clinton will send to Capitol Hill on Feb. 1. And they are considering whether to make a renewed push starting with the State of the Union address, scheduled for Jan. 19, for a bipartisan agreement on shoring up the Social Security system.
In the last week, White House officials have been floating the idea of leaving the current retirement system more or less intact, with its financial problems addressed through a package of benefit cuts and tax increases.
To make that approach more palatable to Republicans who have been demanding that Social Security be remade to include private investment accounts, the White House would then call for the creation of retirement accounts that would not technically be linked to Social Security but would use the Federal budget surplus to give individuals tax breaks or other incentives to save for old age.
With Republicans arguing that future budget surpluses will be big enough both to fix Social Security and to finance a big tax cut, the Administration is also considering whether to lay out explicitly how it would use the surplus beyond dealing with Social Security.
"What the President believes is that the agenda-setting function is vital to the Presidency," said Paul Begala, senior adviser to the President. "Last year he was quite innovative in using the coalescence of the State of the Union and the budget and the absence of Congress in early January to dominate the agenda and set the policy agenda for the year. He intends to do the same thing this year."
Mr. Begala bristled at the idea that the policy proposals Mr. Clinton announced last week -- long-term care, after-school programs, drug treatment for inmates -- were intended to divert attention from impeachment.
"This is not a diversion, this is the Presidency, this is our job, it's leading the only superpower on God's earth," Mr. Begala said. "It's what we did last year before anyone had heard of Monica Lewinsky."

HEADLINE: Editorial Notebook;
Beating the Yanquis at Their Game

BYLINE: By TINA ROSENBERG 

 BODY:
Cuban and American leaders are pondering the issue of whether a Baltimore Orioles visit to Cuba would strengthen or weaken the regime of Fidel Castro. The question seems improbable, yet governments have long used baseball to promote their values and politics. When the Sandinistas took power in beisbol-crazed Nicaragua in 1979, they considered banning the sport. Instead, they decided they could use it to help build the New Socialist Man. They began with Managua's 30,000-seat stadium, called "Anastasio Somoza Garcia" after the father of the dynasty the Sandinistas overthrew. They renamed the stadium for the man who shot him.
Anti-American governments love to use the symbol of America as a political canvas. Baseball was exported to Mexico by American railroad engineers, to Japan by missionaries and to Panama by canal builders. An American consul created the first Nicaraguan team in 1905. Baseball's empire encompasses mainly countries that have spent long periods in America's grip. Resentment and revolution also flower in these environments, one reason Cuba, Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic have all had governments that might want the Yankees to win, but certainly want the Yanquis to lose. And although foreign fans, especially Dominicans, treat their Major League players as national heroes, many also resent a baseball relationship that has mirrored America's economic and political practices abroad, with the gringos raiding the best players and then claiming their tournament as the World Series. 
 In Japan, besuboru is designed to reinforce the values of selflessness, obedience to authority, hard work and loyalty. Robert Whiting, who has written books on Japanese ball, notes that players practice to near-collapse. A players' strike is inconceivable, and few players even change teams or demand high salaries. A superstar American player who took leave from his Japanese team when his 8-year-old son had brain surgery was fired.
Baseball stadiums in Nicaragua in the mid-1980's looked like American ballparks before the days of Beanie Baby giveaways and exploding scoreboards. In the Heroes and Martyrs of September stadium in Leon, Nicaragua's second-largest city, signs advertised Coke and beer, vendors sold hot dogs and the announcers hawked local restaurants.
Nicaragua's best player was Julio Medina, captain of the national team and Sandinista icon. Before the revolution, Medina had grown up cheering for the Cincinnati Reds, but when a scout for the Reds offered Medina a contract in 1984, he said, essentially, no thanks, I'd rather be an agronomist.
"The leaders of the revolution and in sports want to form a new man, both as a professional and as a sportsman," he told me at the time. Biology student by day, member of the Sandinista Youth, Medina even turned down the per diem players received when traveling abroad. When I watched him play, he shook hands with the opposing players when he reached their bases. At one point he tagged out a player trying to steal second, and as the player walked away, Medina shook his hand.
For Havana, the Olympic gold medals won by Cuba's baseball players help show the superiority of socialism. Players who want to pitch for the Yankees must come to America by raft. But pre-revolutionary Cuba had minor-league teams. One American scout, Joe Cambria of the Washington Senators, lived in Havana. Mr. Castro, who pitched (right-handed) at the University of Havana, had two tryouts with the Senators but was rejected -- good slider, mediocre fastball. Baseball will not bring Mr. Castro's regime to an end. But had Mr. Cambria been more patient with a developing prospect, baseball might have prevented it. TINA ROSENBERG

HEADLINE: Auction Plan For Gardens Stirs Tensions

BYLINE: By ANNE RAVER 

 BODY:
In its latest move to get vacant land back on the tax rolls, the Giuliani administration has announced plans to auction off more than 100 of the abandoned lots that have been reclaimed as gardens by community groups throughout the city. Notice of the auction appeared in three recent issues of The City Record, the city's daily journal of public transactions.
The planned sale of the properties, expected in May, has renewed tensions between the city and community gardeners, who protested last fall when the city began razing some gardens to make way for housing developments. 
 Unlike those gardens, the ones to be auctioned in the spring are to be sold to the highest bidder, for any use allowed by zoning.
An official with the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, the agency that oversees community gardens, confirmed yesterday that 112 lots were on the auction block. They are among more than 300 vacant lots the city wants to sell.
"The Giuliani administration is trying to dispose of property not slated for housing development, economic development and so forth," said Hector Batista, first deputy commissioner at the agency. "We are trying to privatize as many city-owned properties as we can."
Mr. Batista said community gardeners had known all along that they would have only temporary access to these public plots. "People are there on an interim basis," he said. "People that administer the gardens know that at some point or another, the city is going to take some sort of action." Of the more than 500 city lots that are now used as community gardens, only 36 have been designated as permanent gardens, he said.
The Mayor's office at first denied the intention to sell. "They're on the list of properties being assessed," Jake Menges, chief of staff to Deputy Mayor Joseph Lhota, said when reached on Dec. 29. "It doesn't mean they're being sold." Mr. Menges said the Mayor's office had asked "every single agency to give us a rundown of their properties." He added that "it's an asset evaluation program."
Mr. Lhota and Mr. Menges were not available for comment yesterday, the Mayor's office said.
The list of lots for sale includes 20-year-old gardens like Parque de Tranquilidad and the All People's Garden, on the Lower East Side, which are graced with mature trees and wrought-iron fences. Another is the Garden of Eden, started by Lucy and Percy Heron, on a troubled block in Queens. It was featured three years ago in National Geographic magazine in an article celebrating the 25th anniversary of Earth Day.
"It's unbelievable," said Andrew Stone, director of the New York chapter of Trust for Public Land, a land conservancy and open-space advocacy group. "That garden is a source of stability for a neighborhood that has experienced a lot of problems. It's a model for a small community garden that functions as a community center. They run a children's program there every summer."
The city's community gardening agency, Greenthumb, which was set up in the early 1970's to lease vacant spaces to gardeners on a temporary basis, would not comment on the planned sale. The director referred all questions to the Parks Department.
The gardens for sale are listed in the Jan. 8, Dec. 21 and Dec. 9 issues of The City Record. There are to be public hearings on Wednesday at 10 A.M. at 22 Reade Street, and on Jan. 27 and Feb. 10 at 10 A.M. in City Hall. There is also to be a hearing on Friday at 10 A.M. in the City Council chambers of City Hall to discuss the proposed sale, sponsored by the Committee on Parks, Recreation, Cultural Affairs and International Intergroup Relations.
In addition, 23 gardens were listed last fall on the city's request for development qualifications sent out to developers to participate in the Partnership for New Homes and Neighborhood Builder Programs.
The city is required to give community boards notice of requests for development qualifications, in order to review the properties in question, but none was given.
The city has repeatedly said that the formerly vacant lots were for interim use only, but over the years, the Greenthumb program started more than 750 gardens. Of those, 37 have been given permanent status by the Department of Parks and Recreation. Some of the others were bulldozed this fall, sometimes without notice.
Over the last three months, about 20 community gardens have been bulldozed to make way for housing and commercial development. And an additional 58 are scheduled for destruction.
Since all of these lots have been through the Uniform Land Use Review Process, the city can dispose of them as it sees fit, regardless of how long ago they underwent the review process.
Steven Frillman, executive director of the Green Guerrillas, a group that has organized and tended hundreds of community gardens since 1973, said more than half of the gardens to be auctioned went through the review process more than 15 years ago. "If the sites haven't been reviewed on the local level for 10 years," he asked, "doesn't the city have an obligation to go back and review these sites?"
Borough presidents have also protested the sale of the gardens. "They said these lots were for housing, and it's a lie," said the Bronx Borough President, Fernando Ferrer, whose borough has 19 gardens on the auction list. "What they're having is a cake sale."
"They're trying to sell out from under the community some of the award-winning gardens of this city," he said. "And they'll end up being parking lots, or flat-fix shops. It doesn't deal with housing needs, and worse than that, it just degrades the neighborhoods they insist they want to protect. And it returns next to nothing for the city."
Brooklyn has 36 gardens on the auction list.
"Did anybody go out to these sites and look at them before determining the sale, or did somebody just say, 'Here's the first batch,' " asked Greg Brooks, chief of staff for the Brooklyn Borough President, Howard Golden. "When the portfolio of property is as large as this city has, one would hope there would be planning before there are land sales."
Manhattan has 21 gardens on the list. Its Borough President, C. Virginia Fields, also called on the city to reopen the review process. "So many things change in a community, it would be worthwhile to reconsider those sites," she said.
The Department of Citywide Administrative Services has about 11,000 vacant lots in its inventory, and the Giuliani administration has vowed to get any nonrevenue producing properties on the auction block.
The office of the City Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, said it would review the remaining 600 gardens "on an individual basis, and determine the appropriate disposition."
The Trust for Public Land has lobbied city agencies for two years now to have gardens worthy of permanent status released to a private land trust. "We'll take the gardens and find the appropriate stewards for them," Mr. Stone said. "We have proposed that to the city and never gotten an answer."
Gardeners have been nervous since last April, when community gardens were transferred from the Parks Department to the housing agency.
"We've been waiting for the other shoe to drop," Mr. Frillman said. "But this feels like the whole shoe store. The entire inventory of gardens could be auctioned off."

HEADLINE: Once More, Schumer Is Sworn In As Senator

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
In a day of pomp and celebration by a political party that has little to cheer about this decade, thousands of New York Democrats assembled at Lincoln Center yesterday to whoop and cheer as Charles E. Schumer was sworn in -- for a second time -- as New York State's new junior Senator.
"Senator Chuck Schumer -- doesn't that have a nice ring to it?" said Vice President Al Gore, who flew to Manhattan to administer the oath to Mr. Schumer at Avery Fisher Hall for an audience that commemorated the moment with a 30-second burst of flashbulbs. The state's Democratic leaders, many of whom are beginning to consider Mr. Gore's own political future as he steps up his Presidential bid this year, responded to the Vice President with warm applause as Mr. Schumer's wife, Iris, and daughters, Jessica, 14, and Alison, 9, laughed and clapped on the stage. 
 There was a certain familiarity to the event for anyone who has been following the recent career of the former nine-term Congressman from Brooklyn. Mr. Schumer was, in fact, sworn in at a ceremony in Washington just last week -- placing his left hand on the same Bible, which he had saved from his bar mitzvah, as he used yesterday, and taking the oath from the same Vice President of United States.
The event's moderator, Robin MacNeil, the retired television journalist, referred to it as Mr. Schumer's "second annual inauguration."
But there were some differences. Last week's event on Capitol Hill was attended by 50 or so people and was sponsored by the National Soft Drink Association. Yesterday's was attended by more than 2,000, and was sponsored by the state Democratic Committee. The crowd at Avery Fisher Hall heard performances by the Boys Choir of Harlem, T. S. Monk Jr. (the son of the jazz pianist and composer), and Itzhak Perlman, the violinist, who played American standards. William Kennedy, the Albany novelist, gave a reading.
And Mr. Schumer, speaking to an audience that clearly was unhappy with events in Washington -- Representative Jerrold Nadler, among President Clinton's most public defenders on the House Judiciary Committee, received a standing ovation as he walked into the room -- warned against what he described as a "corrosive partisanship" that he said was making young voters cynical.
"What began 25 years ago with Watergate as a solemn and necessary endeavor to restore the public trust has now grown beyond our control," Mr. Schumer said. "We are in danger of criminalizing our differences -- of using scandal and innuendo to win at the gavel what we can not settle at the ballot box. Instead of great debates about the future of our Republic we have new politics of fear and smear, where the loyal opposition is too often bent on personal destruction."
Mr. Schumer made only an indirect mention of Alfonse M. D'Amato, the three-term Republican he handily defeated last year, and the Senate campaign. It came when, in listing his priorities as Senator, he stressed the need to unify the state.
"Upstaters must not let politicians demonize downstate -- such attacks do not create one new job," Mr. Schumer said. Mr. D'Amato sought to portray Mr. Schumer as hostile to upstate interests.
Mr. Schumer went out of his way in the speech to telegraph his concern about the problems of upstate New Yorkers. "I know the pain you feel because the nation's economic boom has left you behind," he said.
The swearing in drew a wide representation of Democrats from across the state, including most of the Congressional delegation, with the exception of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, and even some Democrats who had not supported Mr. Schumer, including Edward I. Koch, the former Mayor of New York. "They invited me, so I came," Mr. Koch said last night.

HEADLINE: N.F.L. DIVISIONAL PLAYOFFS;
The Redskins Said to Be Sold for $800 Million

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

 BODY:
The Washington Redskins and their new stadium were sold yesterday to a group headed by Howard Milstein, co-owner of the New York Islanders hockey team, for $800 million, a record price for a domestic sports franchise, according to two people involved in the sale.
The sum to be paid to the estate of the late Jack Kent Cooke, the former owner of the team, by Milstein and his partner, Daniel Snyder, exceeds the $530 million paid by Al Lerner last August for the expansion Cleveland Browns football team, the previous record sales price. The Browns' price tag included a $54 million contribution toward building the team's new municipally-owned stadium . 
 The price paid for the Redskins reflects the cash flow generated by Jack Kent Cooke Stadium, which just completed its second season of operation. Cooke Stadium has 15,044 club seats, which cost $995 to $2,500 each annually, and 280 luxury suites that rent for between $45,000 and $160,000 each per season. The Browns' stadium will have fewer luxury suites and club seats.
The Redskins receive revenue from all tickets sold, parking and concessions.
Their sale will be formally announced today.
Milstein, who bid unsuccessfully for the Browns, will have to sell all or part of the 45 percent stake in the Islanders that he owns with his brother, Edward, to comply with the National Football League's cross-ownership rules.
When he sought to buy the Browns, Milstein said that if he got the team, he would sell his family's ownership in the Islanders to the team's co-owner, Steven Gluckstern. He was expected to follow that course now.
Milstein's family is worth billions of dollars, from New York-based real estate and banking empires. Snyder owns a Washington, D.C., communications firm.
In addition to reflecting the cash flow at Jack Kent Cooke Stadium, the $800 million purchase price was influenced by the Browns' sale price, the $70-million-a-year guaranteed to each N.F.L. team owner from the new television contracts, and the size and influence of the Washington market, which is nearly one-third bigger than Cleveland's.
The amount of money produced by a stadium is the economic factor that divides the richest teams from the rest and makes franchises leap in value. It was why a successful team like the Minnesota Vikings, which does not generate huge wealth from the municipally-owned Metrodome, sold for a modest $250 million last year to Red McCombs.
The Milstein-Snyder group defeated three others, including one formed by John Kent Cooke, the son of the late owner, that was described as very strong by the people involved in the sale process. Other bidders included John McMullen, the owner of the Devils; Charles F. Dolan, chairman of Cablevision Systems, and Sam Grossman, an Arizona shopping center magnate.
By the terms established by the Cooke estate, Milstein and Snyder are acquiring the team's stock, a transaction that will funnel the proceeds tax free to a charitable foundation set up by the estate. The $800 payment includes $161 million for the estate to pay the remaining debt on the stadium.
The Browns' sale, by comparison, was an asset purchase. The Redskin process, compared with that of the Browns, was quiet. The estate imposed severe confidentiality restrictions, rules that were stern enough so that bidders like McMullen and Dolan denied they were bidding. With the Browns, the league controlled the process, inviting the bidders to meetings covered by the news media.
League approval of Milstein and Snyder should take 60 to 90 days, but the time span could be shorter because N.F.L. owners are already familiar with Milstein. It is not known whether that time frame will preserve the job of Redskins Coach Norv Turner, whose team was 6-10 this season. Had John Kent Cooke acquired the team, Turner's future was believed to be more secure.

HEADLINE: Fever Pitch: Getting Doctors To Prescribe Is Big Business

BYLINE: By ABIGAIL ZUGER 

 BODY:
On a recent Tuesday afternoon, Dr. Spartaco Bellomo took a few minutes before office hours began in his Jersey City suite to attend to one of the few traditions of medical practice to survive almost unchanged from the mid-19th century.
It involved leaning back in his chair, listening, nodding, asking a question or two and murmuring a few reassuring words. In the chair opposite Dr. Bellomo, however, sat not a patient but Marie Atkinson, a sales representative from Du Pont Pharmaceuticals, plugging the company's newest product. 
 "How are your patients doing on Sustiva, Doctor?" Ms. Atkinson asked, her lap piled high with literature about the drug. One of Dr. Bellomo's patients was doing very well indeed, and Ms. Atkinson beamed. "Excellent," she said, rising to go. "Doctor, you've made my day."
It was in 1850 that a drug detail man first knocked on an American doctor's door to take up just a few moments of his time, and the dialogue has not stopped. But it grows louder. Since an overhaul of the health care system fizzled four years ago, the pharmaceutical sales force has exploded, from about 35,000 full-time sales representatives and supervisors in the top 40 pharmaceutical companies in 1994 to more than 56,000 in 1998, according to the Scott-Levin consulting firm in Pennsylvania. An additional 6,000 people are employed by independent marketing agencies.
Scott-Levin estimates that pharmaceutical companies in the United States spent $5.3 billion in the first 11 months of last year sending representatives into doctors' offices and hospitals, and $1 billion more holding marketing events for doctors.
That translates into nearly one drug salesperson and almost $100,000 for every 11 practicing physicians in the United States, a class size and budget that might be the envy of any educational venture. But the relationship between the pharmaceutical sales force and the doctors it plies with information has been fraught with tension for years, and many doctors say that the new numbers are only making it worse.
National spending for prescription drugs has more than doubled in the last decade, to $78.9 billion in 1997 from $37.7 billion in 1990, according to IMS Health Inc., which collects health-related information. A recent analysis in The New England Journal of Medicine noted that the percentage of the personal health care dollar spent on prescription drugs was growing faster than any other part, including doctor and hospital bills, partly because prescription drug costs have risen on average 17 percent a year in the last few years.
The same industry pressures thought to be responsible for these soaring costs have helped bump up the sales force. Developing drugs remains a huge uncovered expense for the industry. Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, an industry group, has calculated that only 3 in 10 brand-name drugs make enough money to cover the average research and development costs. Meanwhile, the organization says that generic drugs are accounting for an increasing percentage of prescriptions, taking business away from brand-name pharmaceutical companies. It estimates that 44 percent of prescriptions were filled with generic drugs in 1997, up from 27 percent in 1996.
And as the Food and Drug Administration speeds its approval of new drugs, more and more unfamiliar -- and expensive -- brands must be introduced to prescribing doctors, while at the same time more medically similar drugs are clamoring for their allegiance.
Against this background, the sales force performs a vital educational role for the industry, said Michele Robinson, a spokeswoman for the National Pharmaceutical Council, an association of pharmaceutical companies. Sales representatives introduce doctors to new families of brand-name drugs and update them on using the older ones.
"The drug companies still view the physician as their primary client," she said.
 
Putting a Pill In a Pretty Package
But in the drug representatives' patter, the usual questions of accuracy and reliability that dog all highly competitive advertising ventures apply.
Over the last 20 years, studies have repeatedly shown that doctors who say they rely a great deal on information supplied by pharmaceutical representatives instead of medical journals tend to have more expensive prescribing habits than other doctors, and are somewhat less likely to choose the best drugs for a given job. One study, published in The Journal of the American Medical Association in 1995, found a dozen errors of fact in tape recordings of 13 presentations made by drug representatives to doctors, errors that invariably favored the presenter's own drug over the competition.
Other issues compound the problem. Given three medically equivalent brand-name drugs, is a harried doctor more likely to write a prescription for the one featured in the small print of an obscure medical journal, or the one endorsed in a few pithy words by the sales representative who just left a stack of colorful brochures in the office? Or might the doctor choose over either of them the brand whose logo is embossed on the expensive fountain pen another salesman pressed into his hand at an elegant dinner the night before? No one knows.
Despite significant changes in medical advertising and medical practice this decade, face-to-face drug promotion remains an invaluable marketing tool.
"Personal selling is still the most effective and certainly the most expensive way of selling prescription medications," said Dr. Mickey C. Smith, professor of pharmaceutical administration at the University of Mississippi in Oxford and an authority on drug marketing.
The profile of sales jobs has changed slightly over the decade, Dr. Smith said. In addition to calling on doctors, drug representatives now make calls on executives and pharmacists who supervise the formularies of hospitals and insurers. Sophisticated prescription tracking systems can identify which doctors are prescribing medications and let representatives tailor their presentations, encouraging the reluctant prescribers and complimenting the enthusiastic. But even with a growing percentage of advertising budgets dedicated to introducing drugs directly to consumers, the industry has realized that the doctor ultimately makes the prescribing decisions.
And so in private offices and hospital corridors alike, traditional sales representatives energetically chat up the staff. Unlike the salesmen of years past, many now have a strong background in science or health care (Ms. Atkinson of Du Pont is a nurse), specialize in only one drug or group of drugs and get to know their field of medicine very well. Some become so expert that they begin to blend into the health care team. Salesmen who sell surgical devices have long been present at operations to guide doctors using new equipment; in a widely publicized case in New York City in November 1997, Beth Israel Medical Center was accused of allowing a salesman to operate a piece of surgical equipment while doctors performed a procedure on a young woman who later died.
For representatives who sell drugs rather than equipment, the Food and Drug Administration tries to forestall the practice of medicine without a license with guidelines that strictly limit what the representatives may and may not discuss with doctors. Representatives are limited to passing on only the most basic information about a drug; they cannot discuss studies in progress or observations the drug agency has not yet screened for distribution.
 
Drawing the Line At Chocolate Mousse?
But the Food and Drug Administration cannot stop representatives from sweetening their presentations with little extras. These range from reprints of pertinent articles and colorful charts to hang in the office, to ballpoint pens and pocket calendars bearing product or company logos, to trays of cookies, bagel breakfasts and pizza lunches. Many representatives routinely lug cartons of drug samples with them to keep office cabinets stocked with their product.
And often the extras take on another dimension entirely, always in the name of education. Some representatives buy expensive textbooks or pay for trips to conferences for a doctor or the doctor's trainees. Others sponsor golfing outings, river cruises or lavish dinners at expensive local restaurants where an after-dinner speaker discusses the state-of-the-art treatment of a given condition and, inevitably, the place therein of the sponsor's drug.
Doctors have long debated where, in the spectrum of pharmaceutical-sponsored information, pens, books, white wine and chocolate mousse, comes the ethical place to draw the line.
For some doctors, keeping an open door for the sales representatives is an educational imperative made more essential by the glut of new products.
Dr. Bellomo of Jersey City, for instance, may see a half-dozen or more representatives a week, usually by appointment, spending as long as a half-hour with each. The information they provide him is valuable "at least 90 percent of the time," he said. One passed on a new safety warning about a drug a few months ago, Dr. Bellomo said, and the official warning still has not arrived. "That person is welcome in my office anytime," he said.
For other doctors, there is persuasive evidence for giving the representatives a wide berth.
"I basically do not go to them for information," said Dr. Allan S. Brett, director of the division of general internal medicine at the University of South Carolina School of Medicine in Columbia. "When a new drug is coming out, I tell the representative, 'I'm really not interested in what you have to say. I'm glad you told me it's coming out, but I'm going to get my information from somewhere else.' "
Dr. Bellomo sees drug samples as a handy way to start a patient on treatment at night after the drugstores are closed, and a way to ease the cost of treatment. But for Dr. Brett they are an insidious way to hook doctors and patients on new, expensive drugs, when older, cheaper, safer alternatives might easily suffice.
The issue of gifts also divides doctors. Some agree with the official policy of the American Medical Association that pens and other items of negligible value are permissible, as are gifts like textbooks that have an educational value that might indirectly benefit the doctor's patients (whose prescription dollars are, after all, directly paying for the gifts).
But for other doctors, even trinkets are troubling. "The fact that you can walk down the hall here and every pad, every pen, every little magnet on the door for messages has a drug company's name on it," Dr. Brett said, "that bothers me. I think there's a cumulative ethos that's bad."
Dr. Allen F. Shaughnessy, director of research in the Family Practice Residency in Harrisburg Hospital in Harrisburg, Pa., said, "I can buy my own pens and sticky pads." Like other medical educators, Dr. Shaughnessy is increasingly concerned with what kind of limits, if any, he and his colleagues should place on the contact between the residents training in his program and drug sales representatives.
 
Roaming the Hallways, Or Kept at Bay
Hospital policies vary. Some ban drug representatives from busy patient care areas or confine them to a room at the end of a hall; others confine sales pitches to specific activities on specific days, while others issue sales representatives identification tags and allow them to roam.
And on teaching hospital wards the representatives -- friendly, well-dressed, bearing gifts and food -- are invariably popular visitors. Dr. Shaughnessy said he once found residents actually presenting cases to a pharmaceutical representative for treatment advice, apparently finding him more pleasant and accessible than their supervising physicians.
"My zealous approach was, throw the bums out," Dr. Shaughnessy said. "But then I thought, no, we're really throwing out a useful information source for a lot of people." He now invites sales representatives to a twice-monthly seminar on "information management," where his residents critique their sales presentations for logic and usefulness.
Even so, Dr. Shaughnessy is seeing a difference in his trainees. "I've been doing this for a long time," he said. "It seems like 10 years ago there used to be more moral outrage among the residents," he said, about receiving biased information disguised as education. "Business is a big part of medicine now," he said. "It's easier for the drug reps to sneak in under the radar."
Ms. Atkinson of Du Pont said that only a single doctor among the 385 she visits in her territory has told her that he has a policy of not speaking to pharmaceutical representatives. But Ms. Atkinson still leaves information in the lobby for him, she said, and Du Pont's prescription tracking service lets her monitor his prescribing habits. And "he's writing," Ms. Atkinson said. "He's writing."

HEADLINE: THE CASTRO DOLLAR: A special report;
In Cuba's New Dual Economy, Have-Nots Far Exceed Haves

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: HAVANA, Jan. 10

 BODY:
Some days Avilio Guia likes to come and sit outside the new Carlos III Market and watch the people coming and going from dollar-only shops.
He was a foreman on the construction team that built the mall a year ago. Now, it is a world out of his reach. His Government salary is only 600 pesos a month, less than $30. He has no way to earn hard currency and the shops inside accept nothing else. 
 "I could never buy anything here," the 56-year-old builder says, balancing the cheap cigar he bought in a Government store in his hardened hand and peering up at his work, at the abstract sculptures hanging from the ceiling, the colored lights and the corkscrew walkway lined with shops selling watches, televisions, electronics, toys, jewelry. "The people who shop here are mostly people with relatives in the United States, or young women, who get money one way or another from tourists," he says.
Ten years after the Soviet bloc collapsed and cut off Cuba's lifeline of subsidies and aid, Cubans struggle to survive in a dual economy, fueled in large part by money flowing from their greatest enemy, the United States. Washington has maintained a 37-year-old embargo on its nearest Caribbean neighbor but moved recently toward marginally more contact, announcing last week that it would permit payments from Cuban emigres and other Americans to increase.
The once egalitarian island has evolved into a society of haves and have nots, where schoolteachers and doctors supplement meager state incomes with ingenious moonlighting known as "inventando," or inventing, because hotel workers make far more than professionals. More and more people are turning to illegal schemes, running gypsy cabs, engaging in prostitution or black-market sales of Cuba's famous cigars, rum and coffee.
Other Cubans have abandoned state jobs and opened small businesses under new rules allowing self-employment in the faint hope of earning more than they did from the state.
Driving these trends is a simple reality: State-controlled wages have remained frozen while prices have risen dramatically since the Soviet era ended. Even though Fidel Castro's Government continues to distribute rations of subsidized food and to provide free housing, medical care and education, most people cannot make ends meet on salaries or pensions alone.
Government stores are nearly bare, and the food in farmers' markets is relatively expensive, thanks to onerous taxes on the vendors. Only people who get dollars from relatives abroad or tips from tourists can afford to live decently. "One head of garlic costs a half day's salary," lamented one man in his 50's shopping at a farmers' market in the city of Ciego de Avila who asked not to be identified. "We go hungry, or we invent a way to live, to somehow get dollars through contraband, whatever it takes. Here, no one lives on their salaries alone."
The roots of Cuba's economic malaise go back to 1991, when $4 billion in annual Soviet aid suddenly evaporated. By 1993, the centrally planned economy had shrunk by 35 percent, and the island's 11 million inhabitants were squeezed as never before. Prices skyrocketed. Hunger became common. Factories closed for lack of spare parts. Thousands of Cubans began fleeing to the United States on rafts.
Since the crisis hit, Mr. Castro has consistently blamed the United States' embargo for his people's hardships, accusing Washington again and again of "waging economic war."
Nevertheless, Mr. Castro, who remains a die-hard Marxist, reluctantly adopted limited free-market reforms. The dollar was legalized, and Cuba opened its doors to foreign investors willing to enter joint ventures. The Government has poured capital into tourism, building several new hotels -- mostly with European and Canadian partners -- and restoring historic sections of Havana.
Desperate for foreign exchange, Mr. Castro's managers set up stores controlled by quasi-state enterprises that accept only hard currency. The state-owned hotel and dollar store chains compete to some degree with one another, and the Government has also tried to improve productivity at state factories and collective farms, giving managers more power to hire, fire and set productivity goals, and in some cases pegging salaries to production. Some workers now receive bonuses and other incentives.
 
Communism Sprinkled With Small Businesses
Mr. Castro has also allowed people to go into small-scale business for themselves -- although they cannot expand, or employ anyone beyond the owner's family. More than 160,000 people now operate private restaurants, workshops, schools, shoe-repair places or cafes. Spare rooms in houses can be rented. Artisans can hawk their wares to tourists.
The Government also established markets where farmers can sell produce left over after they have supplied the state with its quota.
Despite these elements of private enterprise, Cuba remains essentially a Communist system. Jose Luis Rodriguez, the Minister of Economy and Planning, said last week that the reforms were intended to allow some private employment without dropping the state's commitment to socialism: cradle-to-grave social security, free education and free health care. "We are not going to convert to a market economy," he said.
A vast majority of workers still receive low state salaries in pesos. Net profits from hotels and dollar shops go directly into the Central Bank, where they are available to help finance the Government, diplomats say. In return, every Cuban family gets rations of rice, peas, milk, and other staples at enormous discounts, and is expected to live from the state salaries.
In general, the state discourages the private enterprises by taxing them heavily on expected earnings rather than on actual sales. "One makes just enough to live, no more," said Victor Rodriguez, whose family runs a tiny restaurant in Havana, which the state limits to 12 seats and taxes $200 a month. "It lets us live a little less smothered."
Since Cuba's sugar industry has been in a steady decline for nearly a decade, the new economy is driven largely by a $1.4 billion tourist industry, $800,000 in remittances from Cubans abroad and hard currency tips from tourists. Cuban economists estimate that nearly half the country is now earning some income in dollars.
"We have two markets, segregated, in dollars and in pesos," said Antonio Romero, an economist at Havana University. "We are in the presence of a dual economy, a dual economy that from my perspective is the most complex problem the Cuban economy has today. At the heart of this is without a doubt the measures the Government took in the context of the crisis."
 
No Fresh Vegetables Or Meat at State Shop
Elizabeth Noreiga, 50, stood sullenly in the state bodega known as Unidad 303-04 in Old Havana, waiting for a clerk to measure out her rations of rice, peas and sugar. On one wall was a listing the store's few items, their subsidized prices and how much each family is allowed. No meat or fresh vegetables were available, though tobacco was. The dingy shelves were virtually empty, save for forlorn boxes of cigarettes, matches, a bottle of rum and a few small packages of evaporated milk.
The clerk measured out five pounds of rice for Ms. Noreiga's household of five people, and then two-and-a-half pounds of peas, marking them down in her soiled ration book in pencil. "With five pounds of rice you can't make it through the month, and you can't eat only rice," Ms. Noreiga said. She and her husband, a dock worker, have a combined income of only about $5 a month in Cuban pesos, she said.
"Today is Three Kings Day, and I can't buy anything for my grandchildren," she said, "because we don't have dollars to buy a present."
Several people in the shop said the bodegas seldom had meat, fresh milk or vegetables. When these things come in, they are rationed to families with children. Some people who do not have access to dollars go for months without eating meat.
By contrast, the Cuatro Caminos farmers' market on the opposite side of Havana looks like paradise. The stalls are chock full of produce: cucumbers, beans, rice, lettuce, tomatoes, yucca, yams, mangos and rice. A crush of people crowd the vendors. Upstairs there is a small butchery section, where one can buy pork and mutton, though never beef.
But prices, though reasonable by American standards, are too steep for Cubans trying to live on a basic Government salary of between $7 to $9 a month. A pound of red or black beans costs more than 65 cents. Rice is 22 cents a pound. Vegetables range between 13 and 32 cents a pound. Four pounds of salt pork is $1.13. "If you buy food one month, you don't buy clothes, and if you buy clothes, you don't buy food," said one woman, who asked not to be identified.
The markets depend on middlemen whom the Government has accused of exploiting farmers and has promised to stamp out. They buy excess produce from private farmers and cooperatives and transport it to Havana. In interviews, several said they can make about $5 a day after taxes, assuming they sell everything. "We have to pay a tax before we sell the meat, and we don't sell it, it's our problem," said Vladimir Duran, a 31-year-old butcher.
Last week, Mr. Castro's administrators said they were planning to crack down on the vendors. Since most farmers have no way to transport their produce, fears are rising here that the markets, which have become the main source of food, will shut down.
For years, it was often said about Mr. Castro's Cuba that everything was shared equally, even the poverty. Since the legalization of the dollar, the society has splintered.
Nearly All Suffer,
Even Professionals
Factory workers and farm employees appear to have suffered the most. But even professionals have taken jobs in hotels or moonlight as guides because they can earn more in tips than their Government salaries.
Hortencia Volvio, 47, is typical of working-class people who have seen their buying power disappear. Since she was 18, Mrs. Volvio has worked at the Bantroi Shoe Factory in Havana, cutting the uppers for men's shoes. She makes about $8.45 a month -- enough to live decently in the Soviet era.
In the last four years, her managers have begun docking pay when employees fail to meet production quotas. Some months she makes less than $4. She has eaten no meat since September. "I would like to find another job," she said. "This way, one can't live."
As if to add insult to injury, the shoes she makes are sold in dollar-only shops. She cannot buy them and must make do with defective discards.
She envies Cubans who receive money from abroad. "I would also like to go to the store and buy all the things I need," she said. "I would like to have a good life like everyone else."
Several people who receive remittances from relatives in the United States said they could not survive otherwise. Many said the payments they received, usually of less than $1,000 a year, merely meant that they could eat well and buy good clothes. "I have three brothers abroad, and they send me money; otherwise I couldn't live," said Esperanza Garcia, a 35-year-old veterinarian who was working for $7 a month, plus tips, as a tour guide in a Havana hotel. "I'm lucky. My children do not want for anything."
Then, there are the hustlers.
Every day after school, Juan Antonio, a 51-year-old English teacher who asked that his last name not be published, walks down to Old Havana and prowls Obispo streets, looking for tourists. At home, he has a dozen boxes of fine cigars, all contraband from Cuba's best cigar factories.
"I come to the street and I try to sell you a box of cigars, or I try to take you to a place you don't know," he said. "I come every day after school."
Everyone in the chain of cigar smuggling gets a cut, but Juan says he can make as much $100 a week, far more than his teacher's salary of 200 pesos a month. He says it feels demeaning, after decades of teaching school, to be accosting tourists and hawking cigars. His feet hurt him most days.
 
Some Drive Cabs; Some Are Prostitutes
A porter at a hotel in Ciego de Avila, a veteran of the war in Angola whose salary is less than $10, sells Montecristo cigars on the black market. He said that the illegal cigar business involves people both inside and outside the factories, and that most local officials turn a blind eye.
"They know people need to survive," he said.
In cities, the most common underground activity is driving a gypsy cab. Almost everyone with a car, be it a decrepit 1950's Chevrolet or a 1970's Soviet saloon, uses it to make extra hard currency. Several drivers said the police usually let them go for a small bribe.
Luis Gonzalez Leiba, 40, drives a bus for eight hours a day on a state salary. Every afternoon, he ferries tourists around Old Havana in his 14-year-old Moskvich car. He dodges the police, who demand a $250 tax each month from licensed cabs. "You have to struggle to make it here," he said.
Other people have made more difficult choices. Marisol is 24, and left her hometown of Bayamo two years ago for Havana. She said she quit her $7-a-month job as a clerk at a state-owned store after her husband abandoned her and their 3-year-old boy.
Now she lingers every night at a bar across from the Hotel Capri in a black evening dress, picking up tourists and trading sex for money in a friend's apartment nearby. Marisol, who asked that her last name not be used, said prostitution was one of the few ways she could support her son without going hungry. The Government salary, she said, never lasted an entire month, and her son was underweight and scrawny when they left Bayamo.
She said she found clients two or three times a month, and usually earned between $120 and $300. She loathes her foreign clients for treating her like an object rather than a human being, she said. "But I have to put up with it, " she said. "I do it for a just cause, you understand, for myself and for my son."
Marisol inhabits the nighttime world of Havana's Vedado section, where pimps buttonhole tourists and offer to take them to discos where prostitutes congregate or to meet women in private apartments.
Mr. Castro vowed recently to stamp out this kind of prostitution, and prostitutes in Havana have felt pressure from increased police patrols. Marisol's pimp is a 24-year-old who gave his name as Alberto and said he had dropped out of college because there seemed little point in studying to become a doctor.
His father and mother are both Communist Party stalwarts with Government sinecures, he said, and are disappointed in him. But he makes about $30 a night guiding men to prostitutes. "I don't see a future in this country," he said, drawing on a cigarette. "Think about it. The enemy is the United States, but the money we need, the principal money of Cuba these days, is the money of the enemy."

A Saner Approach On Caesarean Issue

BYLINE: By JANE E. BRODY 

 BODY:
When my twin sons were born 29 years ago, fetal monitoring was not a routine part of labor and delivery, and there was no way to be certain the babies were doing O.K. while my uterus tried in vain to expel them. So when the doctor announced after many anxious hours of unproductive labor that he was going to have to deliver them by Caesarean, my response was, "I don't care if I cough them up as long as they're alive and healthy." 
 Obstetricians and perinatologists who study childbirth say that such feelings are widely shared by mothers-to-be and their doctors. Anxiety about the well-being of the fetus during labor usually overrides concerns about the cost or consequences of Caesarean surgery and even whether surgery is truly necessary.
 
Changing Pressures
Twenty-nine years ago only one birth in 20 was by Caesarean and there was little reason to question whether some of these operations could be avoided. In most hospitals, they were done only when a surgical delivery was deemed necessary to preserve the health of the mother or her baby.
But by the 1980's things had changed drastically. Fetal monitors came into wide use that could indicate, sometimes wrongly, trouble for a fetus awaiting birth, prompting doctors to intervene with an emergency Caesarean. Malpractice suits, too, were on a precipitous rise, prompting doctors to be overly cautious about fetal well-being during labor and a baby's chances of withstanding a vaginal delivery undamaged. And, as more women had surgical deliveries for first births, still further surgeries were scheduled for subsequent deliveries because sometimes the same reason that prompted the first Caesarean was still present and because there is a small but real risk of uterine rupture if a woman with a scarred uterus has a vaginal delivery.
Caesarean rates -- and, consequently, costs of childbirth -- were soaring in most hospitals, peaking in 1988 at a quarter of deliveries. In some hospitals two of five babies were born by Caesarean. Then came pressures from consumer groups, insurers and government agencies to curb unnecessary surgery and the risks it entailed. Guidelines were issued to help doctors more accurately assess the need for Caesareans, and dozens of studies were done demonstrating that most women who had one Caesarean could safely deliver vaginally in later pregnancies.
Still, Caesarean rates nationwide have only inched down -- to 21 percent at last count, far from the target of 15 percent that the government and many experts believe is appropriate. They point out that quite a few hospitals, including some with a fair number of high-risk patients, already have rates at or below 15 percent.
However, last week in The New England Journal of Medicine, four obstetrical specialists from Boston, headed by Dr. Benjamin P. Sachs of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, questioned the wisdom of pressing toward a numerical goal without adequately monitoring the consequences to mother and baby of doing fewer Caesareans. They see economic pressures, not concern for maternal and fetal well-being, as the driving force behind efforts to lower Caesarean rates, and maintain that rates should be determined by risks to mothers and babies of vaginal delivery, not by insurance companies' efforts to cut costs. They say much more research is needed to assess the safety of vaginal versus Caesarean delivery under various circumstances.
 
What Is a Mother to Do?
Clearly, pregnant women are not equipped to be the sole determinants of how their babies should be delivered. While they should be encouraged to express preferences, the final decision should be made in consultation with the attending doctor and sometimes by the doctor alone. To participate intelligently, a woman must be well-informed before she goes into labor about the benefits and risks of the various delivery options under various circumstances.
Caesarean rates are necessarily higher in high-risk pregnancies. These might include mothers with serious health problems like heart conditions or diabetes or with infections that could be spread to the baby during a vaginal delivery. Another consideration is the mother's age. Older women tend to have less efficient labor and more complications. The risk of stillbirth is greater, too. Then, too, many older women having first babies had great difficulty conceiving and can ill-afford to risk losing a baby and having to try again to get pregnant. Thus, doctors might be more inclined to push for a Caesarean in an older first-time mother than to risk damaging the baby in a vaginal delivery.
Potential problems with babies, such as extreme prematurity, multiple births, breech presentation and poor performance on a fetal monitor, also have to be factored into the delivery decision. Even though obstetricians know that monitors often make mistakes and indicate trouble when the baby is fine, it is hard for a doctor to ignore a monitor that signals that the baby is in danger.
Women who previously had a Caesarean have different considerations. Most doctors and hospitals now encourage such women to attempt a vaginal delivery the next time. And studies have shown that 60 percent to 80 percent of such women who do try to deliver vaginally can do so without mishap. (The babies of those who try and fail are delivered by Caesarean.) However, even in the best of circumstances, in 1 percent of cases where vaginal delivery is attempted following a previous Caesarean, the uterus ruptures along the weakened scar line, resulting in a hemorrhage and sometimes a hysterectomy for the mother and emergency Caesarean to deliver the baby.
In most hospitals that offer courses in natural childbirth, there are also courses in vaginal birth after Caesarean, which goes by the acronym VBAC. Introductory sessions outline the benefits and risks of vaginal birth for these women and can help them decide whether they want to attempt it. The Boston experts, among others, insist that the decision to attempt a vaginal delivery after a Caesarean should be made by the mother, not the doctor, hospital or insurance company. And if that attempt is to be made safely, the hospital must be prepared to act instantly if uterine rupture occurs.
Women also need to be flexible about their childbirth decisions. Generally, women should strive for a vaginal delivery but never insist on it when the attending physician recommends against it. While a Caesarean clearly has risks, during and after the surgery (anesthesia, infection, pain and longer post-birth recovery), so has a complicated vaginal delivery. When, for example, labor gets sluggish and the baby fails to progress at a reasonable rate through the birth canal, doctors often try to assist the process with a contraction-stimulating drug that has its own potential complications.
And, if the baby has inordinate difficulty getting through the narrowest part of the pelvis, doctors may assist with forceps or, increasingly now, with a vacuum suction device applied to the baby's head. In a small percentage of cases, these instruments cause cranial bleeding or hairline skull fractures and may even damage the baby's brain. So, every procedure has a risk that must be weighed against the benefits to mother and baby.

HEADLINE: BOOKS OF THE TIMES;
The Modern Political Novel as a Mirror of the Bizarre

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI 

 BODY:

FACE-TIME
By Erik Tarloff
 249 pages. Crown Publishers. $23.
 To get a sense of just how drastically the Washington political scene -- along with the Washington political novel -- has changed over the last few decades, compare Allen Drury's "Advise and Consent," published exactly 40 years ago, with the hot political novel of the moment, Erik Tarloff's "Face-Time." 
 Drury's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel concerned a Senate confirmation battle over a nominee for Secretary of State; the slight but entertaining "Face-Time" concerns an extramarital affair between the President of the United States and the girlfriend of his chief speechwriter. Mr. Tarloff's novel has already created a buzz within the Washington dinner party set that the author and his wife, Laura Tyson, the former chairwoman of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, used to frequent during their years in the capital, and comes adorned with glowing blurbs from Jim Lehrer, Judy Woodruff and Elizabeth Drew.
 Given today's political reality (the Starr report's salacious allegations, months of crude jokes about a stained dress and thong underwear, and the possibility of Monica Lewinsky's testifying before the Senate), it's no surprise that Drury's brand of fiction -- which, for all its melodrama, invested Government dealings with a certain air of gravitas -- should have given way to a considerably cruder, more satiric type of fiction.
Nor is it any surprise that novels that only a few years ago were dismissed as ludicrous fantasies now seem more in touch with our tabloid Zeitgeist. "The Campaign" (1996), by Marilyn Quayle and her sister, Nancy Northcott, postulated a philandering Democratic President and a vast left-wing conspiracy involving bimbos, computer hackers and Asian agents. "1945" (1995), by Newt Gingrich and William R. Forstchen, showcased a "pouting sex kitten" and spy who liked to sit "athwart" the chest of the White House chief of staff. And Larry Beinhart's "American Hero" (1993) -- which inspired the movie "Wag the Dog" and talk of a "wag the dog" syndrome after United States air strikes against Iraq, Afghanistan and the Sudan -- featured a phony war cooked up by a political consultant to bolster a President's falling poll numbers.
It is not just Drury's solemn fascination with "fallible people in difficult situations who were called on to solve great problems" that feels out of date. Ward Just's Washington novels, with their Jamesian moral distinctions and subtle delineation of conflicting loyalties and ideals, now tend to feel old-fashioned as well.
In fact, recent Washington fiction has increasingly tried to cope with the growing bizarreness of real-life politics by indulging in black comedy, tabloid voyeurism and out-and-out farce. Charles McCarry's "Lucky Bastard" (1998) portrayed a sexually rapacious President (possibly the illegitimate son of John F. Kennedy), who marries a leftist ideologue and becomes a pawn of the K.G.B. "The People's Choice" (1995) by Jeff Greenfield depicted a crisis resulting from the accidental death of the President-elect, who is thrown from an amphetamine-drugged horse during a photo op, and the presumptive ascension of his dimwitted running mate. And "Primary Colors" (1996), by Anonymous (Joe Klein), featured the suicide of a campaign worker and an attempt by the candidate's wife to seduce an idealistic aide.
As with "Lucky Bastard" and "Primary Colors," Erik Tarloff's new novel, "Face-Time," gains much of its heat from its portrait of a President (or would-be President) who bears more than a passing resemblance to Bill Clinton. Mr. Tarloff's President, one Charles (Chuck) W. Sheffield by name, may be less touchy-feely than Mr. Clinton and decidedly balder, but he, too, is a politician blessed with "plain dumb luck" and high approval ratings. He is known for his gregarious charm, his ability to compartmentalize different aspects of his life, and his tendency to leave emotional and political casualties in his wake.
As one character observes of Sheffield: "He never is scathed, is he? Other people get scathed in his stead. The designated scathees, you might say. He leaves great trains of mutiles de guerre in his wake as he blithely follows his bliss. Perhaps it's because others are unaccountably willing to do his dirty work for him."
Through Mr. Tarloff's narrator, Ben Krause, we also learn that President Sheffield is an inveterate womanizer, a Don Juan who covets other men's women. Much to Ben's dismay, one of the President's current paramours turns out to be Gretchen Burns, Ben's own sexy and sexually pragmatic girlfriend, who in a typical Washington moment manages to turn men on by slipping into a turtleneck and a nice pair of pleated herringbone tweed pants.
Clearly, Ben is another variation on that other stock character in recent political fiction, the smart, young George Stephanopoulos clone who has surfaced in everything from "Primary Colors" to a host of movies, from "The American President" to "Broken Arrow" to "City Hall." In the case of "Face-Time," he's the President's chief speechwriter, an ambitious yuppie who cherishes his access or "face time" (or, as acronym-fond Washingtonians might put it, S.P.F.T., Serious Personal Face Time) with the President.
While Mr. Tarloff clearly knows his way around Washington, he does not regale the reader with the sort of insider dish that Joe Klein and Sally Quinn lavished on their novels. The story he tells of the sex triangle among Ben, Gretchen and the President is not predicated upon sharply observed little vignettes, comic cameos or even a political agenda. Rather, it has two very simple points to make: that the sex-and-power equation reigns supreme in Washington, trumping both love-and-death and eros-and-lucre; and that powerful men like the President are apt to exercise "noblesse merite" -- that is, "the opposite of noblesse oblige," the assumption that they are entitled in ways that other mortals are not.
"Face-Time" gets off to a creaky start: the reader can feel Mr. Tarloff, a playwright and screenwriter who has worked on such movies as "Aladdin" and "Car 54, Where Are You?," trying to get the gist of writing a novel. It also suffers from occasional lapses of plausibility (perhaps not a major flaw in this day of increasingly implausible news). Its supporting cast members, including Gretchen and President Sheffield, have the emotional life of cartoons, and their utterances often devolve into B-movie cliches.
Still, the story gradually picks up steam, immersing the reader in Ben's tortured (and often comical) efforts to cope with Gretchen's infidelity and the knowledge that he is being cuckolded by the most powerful man in the world, the most alpha of all alpha males.
Along the way, Mr. Tarloff dispenses the sort of observations that might as easily be found in an Op-Ed piece these days as in a novel. His hero, Ben, observes that President Sheffield wasn't Caligula -- he was simply a fellow with sexual appetites, a guy "who found himself in a position where he had the wherewithal, along with the vanity and indiscipline, to indulge them when he shouldn't."
Still, Ben declines to shrug off the President's affair with Gretchen as "a mistake." "A mistake?" he says. "I don't think so. A mistake is when you goof once. An affair spread over several months, with God knows how many trysts, an affair that persists even after it's been discovered, that goes way beyond mistake. Mistake doesn't begin to cover it."
Except, of course, that in today's Washington, it depends on how you define "mistake"; it depends on how you define the word "it."

HEADLINE: A Frayed Deal With North Korea

 BODY:
A new and potentially volatile crisis is brewing between the United States and North Korea. Pyongyang's reckless behavior threatens to unravel a 1994 nuclear agreement with Washington. That would effectively end diplomatic dialogue between the two countries and could lead to heightened military tensions on the Korean Peninsula. Late last year the Clinton Administration appointed William Perry, the former Defense Secretary, to review American policy toward the North. He is now trying to learn more about what Pyongyang is up to and to see if the growing tensions can be diminished.
But he cannot succeed if North Korea continues new construction that would break its pledge to freeze nuclear weapons development or if it alarms its neighbors with further missile tests. At best, North Korea's actions are an attempt to extort new money and concessions from the West. At worst they signal an intention to break the nuclear agreement or even to threaten South Korea and Japan. 
 The 1994 agreement committed North Korea to freeze nuclear programs that were producing bomb-grade materials. In return, a group of Western countries led by the United States agreed to build new civilian power reactors for the North and supply it with imported fuel oil. Until now, both sides have formally complied with the agreement.
But last year, American intelligence agencies spotted the apparent beginnings of a new underground North Korean nuclear complex. Pyongyang refuses to let Americans inspect this site unless Washington makes large additional payments. Then last August, North Korea launched a three-stage rocket over Japan. There are signs that it may be readying another test. The missiles do not violate the nuclear agreement, but they may drive Japan to stop financing the nuclear deal.
Even if North Korea is only advertising its rocket and missile prowess to get the West to pay for freezing these programs as well, it is a troubling development. Paying for a missile freeze might lead to further demands as North Korea looks for ways to keep its bankrupt dictatorship afloat.
America should help North Korea deal with its devastating famine and should offer support if the North begins to move away from its disastrous command economy. But Mr. Perry must make clear to Pyongyang that there are limits to American generosity and that Washington expects the 1994 nuclear agreement to be honored in full.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
All is right with the world (well, not so bad, at least), and U.S. Treasuries are in the doldrums.

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer 

 BODY:
THE Treasury market, an unexpectedly fine performer last year, is not looking so attractive right now. And it may take another rush of panic about the world's economy and global financial stability to turn things around.
Despite low -- and possibly declining -- inflation and the forecast by many economists that the American economy is slowing down, Treasury interest rates, from short-term notes to long-term bonds, have shot sharply higher the last month. The yield on the 30-year bond is now 5.30 percent, well above the 4.96 percent of just a month ago. In trading yesterday, the yield rose as high as 5.36 percent before prices, which move in the opposite direction, rallied to wipe out most of the day's losses. 
 And despite the fact that Brazil has yet to complete its fiscal reform program, that Latin America faces a severe economic slowdown and there is no concrete sign that Japan has been able to turn its economy around, Treasury yields could go higher.
So, what's wrong? A lot of things.
For one, the United States economy is not showing any signs of slowing down, a fact made clear by the November and December jobs reports, both of which were surprisingly strong. The November numbers were reported on Dec. 4, just days before the bond rally peaked and the 30-year bond yield hit 4.96 percent. And December's 378,000 job increase, announced on Friday, was even more surprising.
Goldman, Sachs on Friday raised its growth forecast for the fourth quarter to 4.2 percent from 3.5 percent, left the first quarter at 2.7 percent but lifted the second quarter to 2.2 percent from 1.9 percent. Upward revisions in growth don't help bonds.
The rally in the stock market to new highs is also likely to keep consumer spending stronger in the months ahead, which should help keep growth robust, though other crucial sectors, like capital spending, are slowing.
"This long-awaited slowdown just doesn't come," said Ward McCarthy, managing director of Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, N.J.
He also said "the bond market has just had a tough time competing with this stock market for attention."
Another factor is the perception that the threat of a full-blown world financial crisis has eased. And this, in turn, has reversed the rush to the bond market for safety, known on Wall Street as a flight to quality.
"It is hard to think you should have a flight to quality with the stock market at new highs," said Lewis Crandall, chief economist at R. H. Wrightson & Associates.
The Federal Reserve, which has cut its interest rate target three times since the end of September, and European central banks, which made one rate cut at the end of last year, were major contributors to this change in psychology. Rallies in emerging stock and bond markets have also helped, though by any reasonable measure the world economy still faces a lot of uncertainties, with Brazil No. 1 on the list.
The Fed easing and the stronger-than-expected United States economy lead to another problem for bonds. "It is not likely that the Fed is going to ease anytime soon," said Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at Hoenig & Company in Rye Brook, N.Y. So that hope for bonds, which sparked the big fall rally in the first place, is gone.
The dollar's weakness, especially against the Japanese yen, and a move by some investors into the euro, the new European currency, have also contributed to bond market weakness, some analysts said.
What is not happening, both Mr. Barbera and Mr. Crandall argue, is an inflation scare. "It is not that inflation is going to come back," Mr. Barbera said.
Gerald A. Guild, senior vice president for the taxable fixed-income division of Advest Inc., disagrees a little. "We have a classic inflation scare rasing its head again," he said.
But, in the same breath, he argues that there should be no such fear because "companies cannot pass on price increases." But although he thinks inflation concerns are unfounded, he said the psychology had "dynamically changed" in the last week.
What does this mean for bonds? Mr. Guild thinks that because the inflation scare is phony, the bond selloff should be near its end. He said he would be surprised if the yield on the 30-year bond exceeded 5.40 percent.
Mr. Crandall said that right now "bonds are not perceived to have as much upside" as analysts thought just a month ago. This means selling could push yields higher.
But he is counting on two factors to turn the tide. One is that the economy will slow, though maybe not as soon as he thought. The other is that investors will have new reasons to worry about the stability of world financial markets again soon.
"We will continue to have events in the first half of 1999 that will give Treasuries a flight-to-quality boost," he said. "Global financial markets are going to remain accident prone."

Airbus OrdersSurge 20%, to a Record 556 Jets

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: PARIS, Jan. 11

 BODY:
Airbus Industrie said today that orders soared 20 percent in 1998, to 556 jets, a record for the European plane maker, which has been steadily narrowing the gap with its archrival, the Boeing Company.
The four-nation plane group, the only challenger to Boeing in the large-commercial-aircraft market, accounted for 46 percent of orders booked last year as it won contracts from new customers, including British Airways. 
 The 1998 orders, for planes worth $39 billion, were 30 percent higher than those in 1997 and behind Boeing's tally of 656 planes worth $42.1 billion. While the performance represents a milestone in Airbus's 28-year history, competition is set to intensify this year as orders start to shrink.
Airbus's performance "is very positive" relative to Boeing, said Doug McVitie, managing director of Arran Aerospace, a consulting firm based in Scotland. Still, "it shouldn't be considered a long-term indicator," he said.
Boeing increased the amount of planes ordered by 15 percent in 1998, although the value of total orders fell from $42.8 billion in 1997 as a recession forced Asian airlines to limit purchases of expensive Boeing 747 jumbo jets.
The Airbus increase in market share, to 46 percent in 1998 as measured by units, from 44 percent in 1997, was also helped by its rival's production delays, Mr. McVitie said.
Airbus is a partnership among Aerospatiale of France, British Aerospace P.L.C., DaimlerChrysler Aerospace of Germany and CASA of Spain. Its efforts in recent years to expand its one-third share of the global airplane market to 50 percent has been a major contributor to Boeing's troubles.
Seeing its longtime dominance of the commercial-jet market threatened, Boeing, based in Seattle, engaged in a discounting war and struggled with assembly line bottlenecks to fill the surge in orders.

HEADLINE: U.S. Plans to Retry Keatings On Savings and Loan Fraud

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 11

 BODY:
Charles H. Keating Jr., the former savings and loan executive, will be tried again on charges that he defrauded customers by selling them millions of dollars in worthless bonds, a Federal prosecutor said today.
The case of Mr. Keating and his son, Charles Keating 3d, was returned to United States District Court after an appellate court threw out their convictions and said they deserved a new trial. 
 During a brief hearing, an assistant United States attorney, Brad Sonnenberg, told Judge Mariana Pfaelzer that the Government intended to retry the Keatings.
In a conference afterward, he and the Keatings' lawyers tentatively agreed on a Sept. 14 trial date, which the judge must approve.
Mr. Sonnenberg declined to comment on the case.
Mr. Keating, who was known for lavish spending and big salaries during his days as chairman of the American Continental Corporation, became a symbol of the savings and loan crisis of the 1980's. He was convicted in Federal and state court on charges arising from the $3.4 billion collapse of Lincoln Savings and Loan of Irvine, Calif., which American Continental owned.
His son was also convicted during the Federal trial.
The convictions were overturned on the ground that jurors learned of the older Mr. Keating's state conviction and discussed that in the jury room.
Mr. Keating's state conviction was also thrown out after an appeals court determined that the trial judge issued improper instructions to the jury.
Stephen Neal, Mr. Keating's lawyer, declared that prosecutors should give up. Both the state and Federal convictions were constitutionally flawed, he said, adding, "I think it's a waste of time and money, but I wasn't surprised" at the decision to retry the case.
In a third trial, Mr. Keating's defense could be expected to include evidence that the investments he made had proved to be "very, very sound, economically valuable transactions," Mr. Neal said.
Mr. Keating, who is now 75, appeared at the hearing but declined to comment. His son also did not comment.
The older Mr. Keating was sentenced to 10 years in prison on the state conviction and received a 12-year concurrent sentence in Federal court. He served nearly five years before being freed in 1996. He returned to jail for five days in March after Judge Pfaelzer ruled that he violated the terms of his probation by applying for a passport.

HEADLINE: Tax Break Ruling Angers Advocates of Cheaper Power

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 11

 BODY:
Even as it pushes for market competition as a means to cheaper electricity, the Pataki administration has withdrawn a tax break granted to businesses and individuals that shop around for a power company.
The decision, reversing a ruling made less than two years ago, raises the cost of electricity by up to 4 percent for the small but rapidly growing group of consumers who choose competing suppliers over their established local utility. 
 The move has infuriated companies trying to break into the vast energy market in New York, whose electric rates are among the country's highest. They had expected the earlier policy to stand, but the reversal has made their product more expensive and less attractive to customers.
"The state is raising taxes, raising rates and discouraging competition," said Craig G. Goodman, president of the National Energy Marketers Association, a trade group. "We've got the state encouraging choice, and then, when people take them up on it, they're singled out for punishment."
In many instances, he said, the reimposed tax has wiped out whatever savings consumers gained from buying cheaper power.
Energy companies say most of the 72,000 customers statewide who buy power on the open market do not yet know that their taxes have increased.
A spokeswoman for the State Department of Taxation and Finance, which made the tax ruling, contends that all it has done is reinterpret existing law and remove an unfair advantage that people and businesses who bought power on the competitive market held over those who remained traditional utility customers and must pay the tax. "This evens the playing field," said the spokeswoman, Leah Powell.
She added that the ruling would protect utilities from an unfair advantage given to their new competitors.
But the utilities insist that they did not want the tax imposed. They have put considerable effort into revamping their operations to prepare for the new market, and they hope that robust competition will mean higher prices for their power plants, which they are selling off as part of the reorganization.
"We've invested a lot in retail choice, and we don't want something like this slowing it down," said Richard Mulieri, a spokesman for Consolidated Edison.
The issue could be a sensitive one for Gov. George E. Pataki, whose proudest accomplishment has been cutting taxes. He has spoken often about the need to lower electric rates to make New York more competitive economically, and his administration has brought about the first rate cuts in decades.
Adding to the paradox, the imposition of the tax falls most heavily on large, electricity-hungry businesses, the very customers the Governor says need rate relief most.
The Governor's office declined to comment on the tax ruling. But administration officials say the office had known about it.
The ruling has frustrated officials at another state agency, the Public Service Commission, which governs utilities. They fear that it undermines the work that they have done to encourage power companies to enter the New York market.
The dispute comes as New York, like many other states, is overhauling its electric power market, which has long belonged exclusively to seven utilities, like Consolidated Edison, each with a regional monopoly.
In the future, all customers will be able to choose from several power suppliers, just as they do with long-distance telephone companies. Companies that until recently were only energy wholesalers are being allowed to sell directly to consumers, competing with the established utilities.
The transition is expected to take about five years, except on Long Island, where it has been put off indefinitely by the partial state takeover of the old Long Island Lighting Company.
The tax dispute arises from the fact that an electric bill reflects not one service but several, such as maintaining the system, generating the power and transmitting it. In the past, the utility provided all the services, which were lumped together in one bill. But in a competitive market, the different services are provided by different companies, so they can be itemized.
In 1997, the State Taxation and Finance Department ruled that once competition began and it was possible to separate the charges, the sales tax would not apply to the transmission part of the bill, which experts say is usually 20 to 50 percent of the total. In New York City, the sales tax on electric bills is 8.25 percent for commercial users and 4.25 percent for residences, and it varies slightly around the state.
The 1997 decision meant that most users that chose their power company would save 1 to 4 percent on their electric bills. Traditional utility customers continued to pay sales tax on the whole bill.
But on Jan. 1, Steven U. Teitelbaum, deputy commissioner and counsel at the taxation department -- the same official who wrote the 1997 decision -- reversed himself and ruled that the sales tax applied to the entire bill for all customers. He did not return telephone calls on Friday or today seeking comment.
State law applies the sales tax to goods and some services, but not to the transportation of goods. The 1997 ruling said transmission of electricity was akin to shipping merchandise; the 1999 decision says it is more like a service.
Last year, for the first time, some electricity was made available to customers in New York on the open market, on a first-come-first-served basis. The first steps were in Con Edison's territory, New York City and Westchester County, where 1,000 megawatts, or 9 percent of the power supply, was made available, and quickly bought up by about 2 percent of the customers. An additional 1,000 megawatts is to be opened up to competition on April 1.

Gauging Value on Seats and Suites

BYLINE: By Richard Sandomir 

 BODY:
Last September, when Alfred Lerner bought the expansion Cleveland Browns for $530 million, Howard Milstein insisted that the economics of the deal kept him from budging above $450 million. On Sunday, Milstein and his partner, Daniel Snyder, agreed to pay the estate of Jack Kent Cooke $800 million for the Washington Redskins and their stadium, the most ever paid for a domestic sports franchise.
So if a team that hasn't played a game is worth $530 million and another that lost more than it won this season is worth 50 percent more, what is the value of the Jets, who are 13-4, including Sunday's playoff victory? 
 How can the Jets not be soaring in value, like Yahoo or Amazon.com? The team is playing Denver for the American Football Conference championship; no-shows at Giants Stadium are virtually nil; sales of league-licensed Jets merchandise are ascending, and Coach Bill Parcells is a turnaround specialist in the mold of Louis Gerstner, who masterminded the resuscitation of I.B.M.
So how high has the Jets' value soared? Not much, say sports finance experts, despite the team's improved fortunes. What separates the Jets from the Browns and Redskins is stadium economics, not won-lost record. In this world, your luxury suites matter more than your quarterback.
The Jets' cash flow from Giants Stadium is mediocre. But the Browns' cash take will be terrific. And the Redskins' pockets runneth over with money.
"The Jets don't have good economics," said Paul Much, of Houlihan Lokey Howard & Zukin, an investment banking firm in Chicago. "The big difference is the revenues from luxury suites, concessions, advertising and parking."
Michael Ozanian, statistics editor of Forbes magazine, which recently valued the Jets at $259 million and the Giants at $288 million, said: "The Jets' stadium economics is in the lower third of the league. They won't get much better. I don't think it's possible for them to get much more."
Those economics create a divide between teams because while the National Football League shares more revenues than any other major sport, there are some that it does not. All national television and licensing revenues are shared equally. Visiting teams take home 40 percent of gate receipts, including revenue from club seats and the game tickets for luxury suites.
But owners do not share the annual luxury suite rentals and revenue from concessions, parking, advertising and stadium naming rights. The leases for the Jets, Browns and Redskins show who is winning:
*In a lease that expires in 2008, the Jets pay 15 percent of gross receipts as rent to the New Jersey Sports & Exposition Authority. The team gets 14 1/2 percent of gross rentals from the 72 older luxury suites and one-third from 46 new suites and 120 club seats (the revenue from the new suites and the club seats is split with the Giants and the sports authority). The Jets also get half the concessions cash from their games and 25 percent of the authority's share from Giants games; 25 percent of net parking revenues and 25 percent of the authority's share from Giants games and 30 percent of revenues from non-scoreboard advertising.
*The Browns will get nearly every cent from their new city-owned stadium -- except for annual rent of $250,000 -- including the revenues from 116 luxury suites and 9,500 club seats, which pays for waiter service on cushy chairs.
*The Redskins get everything from Jack Kent Cooke Stadium, because the late Redskins owner built it for $170 million (plus $70.5 million from the State of Maryland for infrastructure work), and all the cash glories that come with it: 80,116 seats selling for $40 to $60 each; 280 luxury suites renting for $60,000 to $160,000 a year, and 15,044 club seats going for $995 to $1,995 a year.
Milstein, whose family real estate and banking holdings are worth billions, knew he was buying more than a team struggling on the field. He was buying another bank. Whether the Redskins are worth $800 million is questionable. Ozanian recently valued the team at $403 million, based on the 1997 season, and figured it would sell for $450 million.
"I thought they'd come in for less than the Browns because the Browns have no major competition; the Redskins have the Ravens nearby," he said. "I am astonished. I just don't understand it."
Ozanian suggested that Milstein and Snyder could sell part of the Redskins to the public, a structure the N.F.L. frowns upon but may have to consider as franchise prices move toward the billion-dollar level.
With his football dream nearly complete -- pending the N.F.L. owners' approval -- Milstein will sell his and his brother Edward's 45 percent share of the Islanders. The Milsteins thought it would be easier to negotiate a deal with Nassau County to replace revenue-scarce Nassau Coliseum. But even a new arena would never be a hockey equivalent of the Cooke Mint -- or any other where the team owns the arena -- because revenues would have to be shared with the county.
Steve Gluckstern, who owns 45 percent of the Islanders, said in a statement: "We have been approached by and may consider a number of potential partners who would reflect my own commitment to a stable, strong and resourceful ownership group."

HEADLINE: Microsoft Puts Its First Witness On theStand

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 11

 BODY:
The Microsoft Corporation began its defense in the Government's antitrust lawsuit today with an economist from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology bearing a massive tome of written testimony with a simple message: Microsoft's business practices are good for consumers, and any Government meddling with the software industry would likely do more harm than good.
The 328-page testimony by Richard L. Schmalensee of M.I.T. is a sweeping rebuttal to the Justice Department's two-and-a-half-month attempt to prove that Microsoft used its monopoly in personal computer operating system software to thwart competitive challenges posed by the rise of the Internet. 
 The Government's case, Mr. Schmalensee wrote in his direct testimony, amounts to "speculation" based on a "morass of E-mails" from Microsoft executives that at first glance may seem damaging, but are not. Forget the atmospherics, he tells the court, and focus on the outcome -- what he insists is a lack of measurable harm, current or future, to consumers from Microsoft's business practices.
"Proper economic inquiry into whether a company is engaged in anticompetitive conduct should end if it concludes that consumers have not been harmed by the conduct at issue and are not likely to be harmed in the future," Mr. Schmalensee wrote.
High and rising product prices are typically the litmus test of whether a monopolist has the power to punish competitors and gouge consumers. The Government's evidence shows that Microsoft has increased the price it charges personal computer makers for its Windows operating system in recent years, even as the prices of other components of computer systems have declined. Still, the cost of Windows accounts for less than 5 percent of the price of a typical personal computer -- not really evidence of the kind of price-gouging normally associated with a monopolist, as some economists have noted.
But the Government's case is focused as much on the future as on the recent past. If Microsoft is allowed to continue to thwart competition, the Justice Department says, consumers will surely suffer from less product choice, less innovation and higher prices in the long run.
The case will be decided by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson in this nonjury trial based on his determination of which side the "preponderance of the evidence" favors. Microsoft's objective is to convince the court that there are enough flaws in the Government's case that the balance should tip toward the company.
In his testimony, Mr. Schmalensee describes the suit by the Justice Department and 19 states as "fundamentally inconsistent."
The Government asserts, he notes, that Microsoft has an enduring monopoly because its Windows operating system controls the basic operations on more than 90 percent of personal computers sold, and that barriers to entry in that market are high. On the other hand, he adds, the Government says that Microsoft invested hundreds of millions of dollars because it was scared of losing its dominance to an upstart maker of Internet browser software, the Netscape Communications Corporation.
"What is striking about the late-night E-mails and the almost frantic concern over competitive threats is that they show that Microsoft itself was extremely insecure about its leadership in operating systems," Mr. Schmalensee said.
David Boies, the Justice Department's lead trial lawyer, replies that Microsoft was indeed deeply worried and "did work to improve its software, but it also had its thumb on the scale."
The Government has made several allegations against Microsoft, but a central one is that the company used its market power to prod personal computer makers, Internet service suppliers and Internet programmers to enter into "exclusionary" contracts that limited the distribution and promotion of Netscape's rival browsing software.
The Microsoft defense, again, is that the outcome in the marketplace shows that Netscape could and did widely distribute many millions of copies of its browser despite Microsoft's purportedly anticompetitive business practices. In the last two years, Mr. Schmalensee notes, Netscape has gained an additional 14 million users of its browsing software.
But to gain these 14 million users, the Government replies, Netscape distributed about 200 million copies of its browsing software at considerable extra cost, even as Microsoft gave away its browser for free and bundled it with Windows.
Such Microsoft tactics, the Justice Department asserts, are part of a pattern of predatory practices intended to stifle competition. Mr. Schmalensee counters that Microsoft's contracts requiring personal computer makers to ship the company's browser with Windows "offer more choices to consumers" and are "therefore pro-competitive."
His testimony is an advocate's brief, so Mr. Schmalensee, like the 12 prosecution witnesses, seems to interpret the evidence to suit his argument. For example, when the experience of America Online Inc. supports the Justice Department, Mr. Schmalensee refers to the leading on-line services company as "Microsoft's fickle partner and bitter rival."
But roughly 200 pages later in his testimony, Mr. Schmalensee cites America Online's success against Microsoft's MSN on-line service as proof that bundled placement on the Windows desktop screen -- an advantage MSN enjoyed since 1995 -- does not thwart rival products from being distributed. America Online, Mr. Schmalensee writes, "skillfully exploited the many distribution channels open to it (or any other competitor) to beat MSN."
Far from being the most valuable real estate in cyberspace, Mr. Schmalensee declares, the Windows desktop is not an "even particularly important channel of distribution" -- a view not held by Microsoft executives, according to several internal E-mail messages in evidence.
Mr. Schmalensee also attacks the Government's case for trying to apply outdated "textbook models of competition" and "chalk board theories" to the fast-changing facts of the software industry.
The Government replies that the economist's stance amounts to trying to get an antitrust exemption for Microsoft and the software business. "He is very close to saying you should never intervene in dynamic, high-technology industries," said Daniel Rubinfeld, a senior economic adviser to the Justice Department's antitrust division.
In courtroom action today, Judge Jackson closed the trial to the news media and public while he heard testimony from Franklin M. Fisher, an economist and Government witness, about the prices Microsoft charges personal computer makers for Windows. The company-by-company pricing data, the judge explained, was "confidential, sensitive, commercial information."
Lawyers for several media organizations appealed. But they only asked that the closed sessions be as limited as possible and that the judge consider releasing transcripts with the sensitive price data redacted. The judge reopened the courtroom in the afternoon, and Mr. Fisher continued his testimony, which is expected to end Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Gore Offers Plan to Control Suburban Sprawl

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 11

 BODY:
Almost 50 years after new Federal highways and the G.I. Bill made it easier for Americans to move from crowded cities to leafy suburbs, the Clinton Administration is proposing an ambitious program to combat the modern-day consequences of the exodus: traffic jams and sprawl.
As part of its latest budget request, the Administration is seeking to commit almost $10 billion -- more than $1 billion of it in new spending -- to local governments and communities for programs that preserve open space, ease traffic congestion and promote economic development in a way that some states are calling "smart growth." 
 The proposal, which the Administration calls its Livability Agenda, draws together and expands programs from more than a dozen agencies, making it the largest commitment ever by the Federal Government to the issue of planned growth.
"In too many places across America, the beauty of local vistas has been degraded by decades of ill-planned and ill-coordinated development," Vice President Al Gore said today, announcing the program. "Plan well, and you have a community that nurtures commerce and private life. Plan badly, you have what so many of us suffer from first-hand -- gridlock, sprawl and that uniquely modern evil of all too little time."
Mr. Gore was careful to explain that the proposal limited the Federal role to encouraging neighboring jurisdictions to solve problems together. The Government's role, he said, should not be "beauty commissar."
While Administration officials are promoting the proposal as a bold stroke, bringing together such traditional adversaries as environmentalists and developers, states like Maryland, Oregon and New Jersey, and local communities and conservation groups, have been attacking problems of boundless growth for years.
Mr. Gore said many state and local officials had been trumpeting their efforts and clamoring for Federal help. In last year's elections, he said, more than 200 jurisdictions had growth initiatives on the ballot, "and most of them passed."
Gov. Parris N. Glendening of Maryland, a Democrat and a leading promoter of "smart growth" development, accompanied Mr. Gore today and said in an interview, "The Federal Government has been behind the states on this issue."
"But the most important thing," Mr. Glendening added, "is that the Federal Government has paused to consider to what extent American politics has contributed to the sprawl."
Pete McDonough, a spokesman for Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, a Republican, noted that Mrs. Whitman focused on the issue in her annual address to the Legislature last year.
Mr. Gore's announcement today was the first of several he intends to make this week, highlighting Administration budget requests. As is typical of such proposals, the Administration did not explain how it expected to pay for the new spending. The Republican Congress regards many Administration initiatives as just a starting point in budget negotiations.
White House officials said that Mr. Gore had been chosen to present issues like sprawl, worker training and empowerment zones largely because he had been the Administration's point man on them for six years. But the announcements also put the Vice President in a spotlight for issues that his aides say will become major themes of his Presidential campaign.
The largest single item of new spending in the Administration growth proposal is a five-year, $700 million program that will allow state and local governments to issue no-interest "Better America Bonds" to lenders, who would claim a tax credit for the life of the bond, rather than receive interest. The money would be used to preserve parks and open spaces, protect water supplies and develop abandoned industrial sites for commercial use -- all vital components to controlled growth.
Mr. Gore said the bonds could leverage as much as $10 billion in investment around planned growth areas.
Another component of the proposal is what Mr. Gore described as the largest ever Federal budget request for public transportation -- $6.1 billion, a 16 percent increase over last year -- to help pay for new projects that ease traffic congestion and reduce air pollution through regional cooperation in fixing roads, expanding public transportation systems and developing alternative routes.
The Administration proposal was generally praised by environmental groups like the Sierra Club, whose executive director, Carl Pope, called it "a good first step" toward reversing 50 years of sprawl.
Business groups, including the National Association of Home Builders, whose members would seem to be affected by restrictions on developement, also found something to cheer. Charlie Ruma, the incoming president of the home builders group, said the proposal would help by clearly defining zoning regulations. But Mr. Ruma objected to the notion that the Federal Government would be helping communities buy land to preserve it.

HEADLINE: 2 More Antiaircraft Incidents in North Iraq

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 11

 BODY:
American fighter jets attacked antiaircraft batteries in northern Iraq in two skirmishes today as Baghdad continued its defiance of American and British control of its skies.
The Pentagon said the American fighters had attacked after the batteries had tracked them with radar, apparently in preparation to fire. But the Iraqi antiaircraft forces did not fire, and the jets returned safely to their base at Incirlik, Turkey. 
 It was not clear whether the strikes destroyed the batteries, the Pentagon said, because of clouds.
Today's incidents fit an increasingly familiar pattern. Almost every day now, Iraqi aircraft or antiaircraft weapons are challenging American and British jets patrolling the northern and southern no-flight zones established after the Persian Gulf war in 1991.
Two more Iraqi MIG jets entered the southern zone today but quickly left, Pentagon officials said.
The challenges follow a series of defiant threats, and some retreats, from President Saddam Hussein's Government, which has vowed to end all cooperation with United Nations, including weapons inspections and efforts by international relief agencies.
On Sunday the Iraqi Parliament postponed a vote to reject United Nations resolutions, including one that established its border with Kuwait and those that the United States cited to create the no-flight zones to protect Kurds in Iraq's north and Shiite Muslims in its south.
Defense Secretary William S. Cohen, traveling to Japan, warned today that any move by Iraq to withdraw recognition of Kuwait would be "a flagrant violation" of resolutions that have stood for nearly eight years.
He also said the United States would strike again if President Hussein threatened Kuwait or Saudi Arabia or used force to crack down on Iraqi Kurds. "What we have said is that to the extent that he poses a threat or moves against Kuwait or Saudi Arabia or the Kurds in the north, that we are prepared to respond," Mr. Cohen said.
Administration officials say they believe that Mr. Hussein is trying to find and exploit international divisions over how to enforce the United Nations resolutions.
But so far, the challenges to American and British aircraft have done little except invite strikes on Iraq's antiaircraft weapons. And Baghdad's public statements have exposed its isolation from important Arab countries like Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright is to visit those two countries this month.
Both of today's incidents occurred this morning near the city of Mosul, Pentagon officials said. In one instance, two F-15E fighter jets fired guided missiles at an antiaircraft battery after detecting that the Iraqis had targeted them with radar, Pentagon officials said. An F-16 fired a radar-seeking missile at an SA-6 surface-to-air missile launcher, the officials said.
On Friday, the commander of American forces in the region, Gen. Anthony C. Zinni, announced that the United States would bolster its force in the region. Eight more F-16's and four aerial refuelers will join 182 aircraft now enforcing the southern no-flight zone.

HEADLINE: Plenty of Snow in Detroit, But Hardly a Plow in Sight

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 11

 BODY:
Every city reacts in its own way to snow. Atlantans panic and drive badly. Washington closes Government offices early and sends everyone home. Chicagoans expect their politicians to have the streets plowed immediately -- or face the consequences at the next election.
Detroit has another, more surprising approach to snow: ignore it. 
 For as far back as this city has been able to check its records, close to half a century, it has had a policy of not plowing residential streets. As a result, it has just 59 snowplows, compared with 750 in Chicago, whose area is just slightly larger. Only large avenues, highways and the streets in front of schools are plowed here, and even those are done slowly.
But with many Detroit neighborhoods still impassable from the foot of snow that fell on Jan. 2, and with three more snowfalls since then having added a half-foot, a lot of people here are suddenly angry about the policy. To make matters worse, the temperature has seldom climbed even into the 20's since the first of the year, and never above the freezing mark, while nighttime temperatures have dropped as low as 10 below zero, unusually cold for southeastern Michigan.
In short, there is no thaw in sight, and the snow is turning to ice.
Workers have had trouble reaching their jobs. Schools were closed for most of last week, and few children have been able to reach them since they reopened on Friday. Food distributors' trucks have had trouble supplying corner grocery stores, which remain common here because the city's poverty and crime have scared off most supermarket chains.
The heavy snowfall nine days ago caused particular trouble at Detroit's airport, where dozens of arriving Northwest Airlines flights waited for hours before unloading passengers because the airline did not have ground crews available. The airline, the city and Wayne County have been trading accusations ever since over whether Northwest should have diverted the flights to other cities or whether Detroit's snow removal policies prevented the airline's workers from reaching the airport.
Gwendolyn Johnson, 23, has been unable to walk her 6-year-old son, Demar, to school because the snow is too deep for his short legs.
"You'd have to walk in the streets," Ms. Johnson said angrily, "and the streets are no better."
One of her neighbors, James E. Barksdale, 75, has lived at his home for 50 years, and in all that time the street in front of it has never been plowed, he said as he stood in 3-degree weather late this morning. He was digging a path down his driveway to the road, where the snow had been tamped down by the repeated passing of sport utility vehicles.
Mayor Dennis Archer has taken the brunt of the criticism. He waited five days to start paying suburban governments to send 17 snowplows here to help clear the streets. Then the suburbs, most of which try to plow all their streets, quickly recalled their trucks when more snow began falling last Friday.
Mayor Archer has asked for a citywide volunteer effort to shovel streets and sidewalks. But that has had limited effect in a sprawling city that is six times the size of Manhattan and has less than half the population.
By coincidence, the city had been planning to improve its snow removal efforts this winter, having ordered 42 new trucks with snowplows for delivery last autumn. But the trucks have not arrived, because, Mayor Archer said in an interview, the manufacturer of the trucks' transmissions is behind schedule.
The policy of letting residential neighborhoods fend for themselves isrooted in the city's peculiar combination of climate and history.
Unlike other Great Lakes ports like Cleveland and Buffalo, Detroit gets little "lake effect" snow, because it is situated on the Detroit River, 20 miles upwind of Lake Erie and across the state from Lake Michigan. So the city usually gets its snow three or four inches at a time; in a city of self-reliant auto workers, driving over a little snow is not viewed as a problem.
Detroit's population has also plummeted, from a peak of 2.2 million in the mid-1950's to some 950,000 now. Four-fifths of the city's white population moved to the suburbs, mainly after the riots of 1967. While there have been recent hints of an economic recovery, the city remains among the poorest in the nation, with thousands of abandoned houses on which no taxes are paid. What tax revenue there is brings many demands other than snow removal.
Beyond all that is the fact that Detroit, though largely a city of single-family homes, has a scarcity of home garages. Few residents have anywhere to park their cars except on the street, which would make snow removal a headache in any case.
Mayor Michael A. Bilandic of Chicago lost an election in 1979 because of his city's difficulties in cleaning up after a blizzard that year, and Mayor John V. Lindsay of New York had trouble winning re-election in 1969 after streets in Queens were not cleared quickly following a snowstorm.
But Mayor Archer, a Democrat, said he believed that Detroit voters would not hold the current problems against him. In any event, he is only one year into his second four-year term.
The conventional wisdom is that even as several more inches of snow fell tonight, the Mayor's reputation was suffering but might yet recover.
"Politically he's damaged," said Mario Morrow, a political analyst here. "I wouldn't say he's buried at this point."

HEADLINE: Smoking Ban Has Not Hurt Restaurants, Analysts Say

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
Since the city banned smoking in restaurants in 1995, restaurateurs have complained that the prohibition is bad for business. Yesterday, a group of academic researchers, admittedly anti-smoking ones, released a series of six analyses suggesting that the ban has not hurt.
The studies indicated that the anti-smoking law, which took effect on April 10, 1995, has had no effect on local sales, job growth or income. The studies, which were financed by the Substance Abuse Policy Research Program, which receives money from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, showed that restaurant industry jobs rose 18 percent from 1993 to 1997, to 19,347. 
 During the same period, sales tax receipts rose 2 percent at restaurants in the city but dropped 4 percent in the rest of the state. The number of restaurants in the city during that period increased 6 percent.
At a news conference, the researchers characterized their work as the first comprehensive look at the city's ban on smoking in restaurants with 35 or more seats. They said earlier studies suggesting economic harm were smaller and were financed by the tobacco industry.
"Local officials can now go about their business of protecting the public from the toxins in second-hand smoke without worrying about this phony issue," said Dr. Stanton A. Glantz, who wrote an editorial accompanying the articles, which are published in the January issue of Public Health Management and Practice.
Mike O'Neal, who owns O'Neal's restaurant on West 64th Street, near Lincoln Center, supported the ban, saying it has helped his business. "If 75 percent of people don't smoke and 25 percent do, that means 75 percent are going to eat out more and 25 percent are going to eat out less," he said at the news conference.
Others in the restaurant industry took sharp issue with the studies' methodology and conclusions. Scott Wexler, executive director of the Empire State Restaurant and Tavern Association, a trade group, said in an interview that his group sponsored a study in 1996 that showed jobs at city restaurants declining 4 percent. He said that since his group's study examined statistics for the months just before and after the law took effect, it could isolate more fairly the "cataclysmic" influence of the smoking ban on business.
Mr. Wexler said his group's study showed retail jobs going up 2 percent at the same time that restaurant jobs dropped 4 percent, suggesting that something beyond general economic trends was at work, he said.
Dan Tubridy, who owns Pier 92, a restaurant in Rockaway Beach, Queens, said in an interview that he lost customers immediately. "They said that if they couldn't eat at my place they were going to Nassau County, pure and simple," he said. "And you know what happens? They don't come back."
Mr. Wexler also pointed out that 8,000 of 15,000 restaurants included in the overall sales tax figures were small enough to allow smoking or were primarily bars, where smoking is also allowed. The study conducted by Dr. Andrew Hyland, a biostatistician, and two colleagues at Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, acknowledged this limitation.
The restaurant trade group is heavily supported by the Tobacco Institute, which recently admitted funneling $443,072 to the group, after earlier claiming a far lower amount. The money was used to lobby the State Legislature for less stringent laws than the city's.
The studies also concluded that the law has been enforced very effectively. An examination of city records, one study said, showed that city health inspectors found smoking at only 2 percent of the 251 restaurants they visited. Another study indicated that 90 percent of restaurant owners reported that their indoor areas were smoke-free. Three out of four restaurateurs reported that complying with the law cost them no money.
Several researchers said the next step would be a dual effort: to pass laws like the city's in other counties, and to extend the city law to bars, both those within restaurants and free-standing ones. "A bar is a workplace," said Dr. John R. Seffin, chief executive of the American Cancer Society. "You should not be allowed to smoke in a workplace."

INTERNATIONAL A3-9
 
U.S. More Isolated In Policy Toward Iraq
A growing number of Security Council members and Arab nations support lifting an embargo on Iraqi oil sales or otherwise relaxing sanctions to relieve the suffering in Iraq. But there is also solid agreement that long-term international supervision is needed to prevent Iraq from acquiring prohibited weapons. A1 

American fighter jets attacked Iraqi antiaircraft batteries after the batteries tracked them with radar, apparently in preparation to fire, the Pentagon said. But the Iraqi antiaircraft forces did not fire, and the American jets returned safely to their base at Incirlik, Turkey. A8
 
Congo Reflects Broader Issues
The Congo war seems to be changing Africa's old rules, as soldiers from no fewer than six foreign nations fight a war that has as much to do with problems outside of Congo as inside it. Many experts say the war may become a point of departure from which African nations begin to re-imagine themselves in ways not possible under the old rules. A1
 
Mentor Challenges Netanyahu
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's political mentor, Moshe Arens, a former Defense and Foreign Minister, announced that he would challenge his former protege for the leadership of the Likud Party in party primaries. Pronouncing the party to be in crisis, Mr. Arens became the second challenger for the Likud title and the eighth candidate for Prime Minister. A3
 
Peres Supports Arab State
Shimon Peres, the former Israeli Prime Minister, expressed support for a Palestinian state, but one reached through negotiations, in the first address by an Israeli to the Palestinian legislative council. The Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, responded with his first detailed comments about the freezing of the latest Israeli-Palestinian accord by Prime Minister Netanyahu. A3
 
New Opposition to Pollard
President Clinton's key national security advisers have recommended that Mr. Clinton deny clemency for the Israeli spy Jonathan Jay Pollard, despite Israeli demands for his freedom as part of the Middle East peace negotiations. A8
 
New Government for Turkey
Turkey's six-week-old political crisis came to an apparent end when a strongly secular politician, Bulent Ecevit, announced that he had assembled a minority government. It is expected to win parliamentary approval by Sunday. A8
 
More Abductions in Freetown
Rebels in Sierra Leone kidnapped two more Italian missionaries by tricking them into believing that they could contact an abducted colleague who was kidnapped by insurgents in mid-November, the Italian Ambassador in Freetown said. A9

Clinton Defends Himself Against Loss of Office
President Clinton formally defended himself for the first time against removal from office by the Senate, arguing that he committed no crimes and that the charges against him are so vague and muddled that they are unconstitutional. Hours later, prosecutors drawn from the House of Representatives released a scorching memorandum mapping their case for an illegal Presidential cover-up, which they will begin to present on Thursday. A1
 
Democrats are debating when would be the best time to try to advance a censure resolution, with some advocating sooner rather than later. A15
 
Two Democratic Senators said that they would try to change the 19th-century Senate rule requiring closed sessions for all debates on impeachment in which senators speak, but odds are strong that the rule will be retained. A14
 
Medicare Spending Slows
The growth of Medicare slowed to a virtual halt last year as spending in the giant health insurance program for the elderly rose by just 1.5 percent, the smallest increase since the beginning of the program in 1965, new Government data show. A1
 
Salt Lake Mayor Lowers Sights
The evolving Olympic scandal apparently claimed its latest victim, one who has not been publicly linked with corruption allegations, Salt Lake City's Mayor, Deedee Corradini. The Mayor said that she would not run for a third term, crushing her dream of presiding over the Olympics in the city. A10
 
Wiring Risk to Planes
Canadian investigators have found extensive wiring problems on several MD-11 airplanes, and United States safety experts say more inspections are needed to avert the threat of in-flight fires. A12
 
Billions for 'Smart Growth'
The Clinton Administration is seeking to commit almost $10 billion, more than $1 billion of it in new spending, to local governments and communities for programs that preserve open space, ease traffic congestion and promote economic development in a way that some states are calling "smart growth." A16

Whitman to Seek Rebates To Ease School-Tax Burden
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey was expected to outline a five-year, $1 billion plan today that would eventually provide an average rebate of $600 to homeowners. The plan would use money from the state's general funds to cover part of the homeowners' local school taxes. A1
 
Sex Shops Are Denied Appeal
The United States Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal from sex shop owners and the New York Civil Liberties Union that a new antipornography zoning law in the city is an unconstitutional infringement on free speech. But the city's success in carrying out the law remains checkered, with strip clubs and adult video stores finding legal loopholes. B1

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Shares End Mixed as Nasdaq Rallies but Blue Chips Falter

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stocks ended mixed yesterday, with many issues pulling back after last week's rally to record highs raised investors' concerns that the market was getting too expensive.
The Intel Corporation was among the prominent exceptions, rallying on expectations that its earnings, which are scheduled for release today, will exceed forecasts. 
 "Shares rose too far too fast in a remarkable week in the market," said Franklin Morton, research chief at Ariel Capital Management in Chicago, which oversees about $3 billion. A week into the year, the Nasdaq composite index is already up 7.3 percent, the Dow Jones industrial average is up 4.1 percent, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is up 2.3 percent.
Yesterday, the Dow average closed down 23.43 points, or nearly a quarter of 1 percent, to 9,619.89, though it rebounded from a deficit earlier in the session that reached 111 points. The S.& P. index declined 11.21 points, or about nine-tenths of 1 percent, to 1,263.88.
Intel helped the Nasdaq set a closing high for a seventh consecutive session. The index jumped 40.18 points, or 1.7 percent, to 2,384.59.
Declining issues outpaced advancers, 1,970 to 1,118, on the New York Stock Exchange; trading volume was 818.1 million shares.
The S.& P. telephone index led the decline in the S.& P. 500, retreating 4 percent after a 5.3 percent gain in four days. BellSouth lost 3 1/16 a share, to 47 7/16; SBC Communications dropped 2 9/16, to 55 1/8, and Bell Atlantic fell 1 11/16, to 54 15/16.
Intel climbed 10 1/16 a share, to set a closing high of 139 3/4. After a surge in computer-buying during the holiday season, Intel, the world's biggest manufacturer of computer chips, is expected to report earnings of $1.07 a share, up from 96 cents a year earlier, based on the average estimate of analysts polled by the First Call Corporation. That would surpass Intel's own optimistic forecasts.
Internet shares surged, led by issues like E*Trade Group, an on-line brokerage firm, which jumped 20 7/8, to 88 1/2, after posting a smaller-than-expected loss for its first quarter.
Campbell Soup fell 6 7/8, to 45 3/8, its biggest decline since 1980, after the company, world's largest maker of soup, said fiscal year 1999 earnings would probably fall short of analyst expectations, as the company cuts costs and reduces shipments of condensed soup in the United States.
Pharmaceutical shares, among the top performers last year, fell for a third consecutive session. Pfizer Inc. declined 4 1/2 a share, to 117 3/4; Schering-Plough lost 2 1/8, to 52 3/4.
Ascend Communications Inc., a telecommunications equipment maker, gained 5 1/4, to 761 1/16, on speculation that Lucent Technologies, the world's biggest telephone-equipment maker, offered to buy it for more than $16 billion. Lucent and Ascend officials declined to comment. Lucent shares fell 2 5/16, to 112 15/16.
General Motors rallied 6, to 86 1/16, after David Bradley, an analyst at J. P. Morgan, raised his 1999 earnings estimate for the auto maker to $8.75 a share, from $8.40. Individual and institutional investors have been betting in recent days that G.M.'s earnings prospects would rise.
Some investors interpreted the G.M. rally and Friday's stronger-than-expected employment report from the Labor Department as signs that the economy remains buoyant. They are concerned, though, that the Federal Reserve -- which helped contribute to the market's strength by lowering benchmark borrowing costs three times starting Sept. 29 -- may be through cutting rates.
"If interest rates have bottomed, or if we get an uptick in rates, that's it for the market," said Frank Curzio, president of FXC Investment Group in Queens.
Concern that Brazil's debt and currency problems will crimp economic and corporate-profit growth in the United States also weighed on stocks.
Brazil's Bovespa index fell 5.6 percent, as a call by the second-most- populous state in Brazil to withhold debt payments to the Federal Government prompted investors to pull money out of the country.
That raised concern that Brazil might eventually default on its foreign debt, causing shock waves in the United States similar to those set off by Russia's default in August.

Bond Prices Fall
By The Associated Press
Bond prices slipped yesterday as the dollar fell further against the Japanese yen, making Treasuries less attractive to international investors.
The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 1 8/32, to a price of 98 22/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, rose to 5.30 percent, from 5.27 percent on Friday.
Bond prices were hurt partly by the continued decline of the dollar against the yen. The dollar fell to a 28-month low against the yen yesterday, extending a slump from last summer's highs despite continued strength in the American economy.
Results of the Treasury's auction of 3-month and 6-month bills yesterday:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Price	98.890	97.773	High Rate	4.39%	4.41%	Coupon Yield	4.50%	4.57%	Low Rate	4.34%	4.35%	Median Rate	4.38%	4.39%	Total applied for	$30,092,821	$28,735,227	Accepted	$11,506,483	$11,565,132	Noncompetitive	$1,434,383	$1,361,556

HEADLINE: THE TRIAL OF THE PRESIDENT: THE PROSECUTORS;
Managers Offer the Details Of the Case Against Clinton

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 11

 BODY:
Representative Henry J. Hyde and the 12 other impeachment managers today presented a road map of the case for removing President Clinton that they plan to make to the Senate beginning on Thursday.
The 105-page document, with 250 pages of supporting evidence, offers a highly circumstantial case that relies on persuading two-thirds of the Senate that a chain of events, read in its entirety, demonstrates a compelling argument for the President's ouster. Each senator will receive a loose-leaf binder containing the material. 
 "The evidence contained in the record, when viewed as a unified whole, overwhelmingly supports both charges," the document states. The President is accused of perjury before a grand jury and obstruction of justice.
The filing tracks the closing arguments made last month by David P. Schippers, the chief House investigative counsel, and the House Judiciary Committee's final report. Those presentations led the full House to approve along party lines the two articles of impeachment against Mr. Clinton.
In its brief, the House managers adopted a tone that was alternately derisive and unyielding as they restated much of the voluminous record that Mr. Hyde and the Judiciary Committee compiled in their inquiry. In salting their brief with words like "sinister" and "plot," the prosecutors were clearly trying to guide their readers to make a dire judgment of the evidence.
Although they were restricted to the House record, the managers' outline also goes beyond bolstering the two articles of impeachment. The prosecutors included in their brief some of the allegations made by the Judiciary Committee in the two proposed articles of impeachment that were not approved by the full House. For example, they refer to the President's failure to respond fully to some of the 81 questions posed by the Judiciary Committee in its inquiry, an offense that was defeated as part of an article of impeachment defining abuse of office.
They complain that Mr. Clinton "elected to follow the pattern of selective memory, reference to other testimony, blatant untruths, artful distortions, outright lies and half truths."
"When he did answer," they added, "he engaged in legalistic hair-splitting in an obvious attempt to skirt the whole truth and to deceive and obstruct the due proceedings of the Committee."
At another point, they cite some of Mr. Clinton's grand jury answers and note that it is illegal to "insert unstated premises or mental reservations into the question to make it technically true, if factually false. The essence of lying is in deception, not in words."
And even as the prosecutors say they need not go into sexual details at the trial, they list the number of sexual encounters the President had with Ms. Lewinsky and the number of times they had phone sex.
"This case is not about sex or private conduct," the brief states. "It is about multiple obstructions of justice, perjury, false and misleading statements, and witness tampering -- all committed or orchestrated by the President of the United States."
At the heart of the managers' case is the charge that President Clinton, in his deposition in the sexual harassment suit brought by Paula C. Jones, offered a cleverly worded lie about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and then schemed to cover up the affair.
In doing so, the House managers argued, Mr. Clinton "deliberately and willfully testified falsely under oath" before a Federal grand jury on Aug. 17. Mr. Clinton engaged in the scheme, the managers asserted, to obstruct both the grand jury and the Jones civil case.
Mr. Clinton, the House managers said, obstructed justice in these ways:
*Trying to influence the testimony of his secretary, Betty Currie;
*Providing several of his top aides with "elaborate lies" about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky;
*Orchestrating a campaign to discredit Ms. Lewinsky to undercut her credibility, and
*Using the power of the Presidency to help get Ms. Lewinsky a job in New York.
In dismissing a frequent defense raised by the White House that Ms. Lewinsky testified that no one told her to lie or bought her silence, the House managers argue that her words are not exculpatory if they are viewed in context along with a skein of events. "Of course no one said, 'Now Monica, you go in there and lie,' " the brief states. "They didn't have to. Ms. Lewinsky knew what was expected of her. Similary, nobody promised her a job, but once she signed the false affidavit she got one."
And the managers stressed what they consider the gravity of the President's offenses, saying they "have the effect of seriously compromising the integrity of the entire judicial system."
The President's misconduct has had "devastating" consequences, they state. "Make no mistake, the conduct of the President is inextricably bound to the welfare of the people of the United States," the managers said. "Not only does it affect economic and national defense, but even more directly, it affects the moral and law-abiding fiber of the commonwealth."
The filing today was the first step in a carefully scripted but still fragile schedule the Senate unanimously adopted on Friday, which postpones a decision on the polarizing issue of whether to call witnesses.
When asked to comment on the Senate's plan, Mr. Hyde told reporters: "I'm in a difficult position. Now is not the time to get angry at the Senate. At the same time, this is a strange process, one we're not familiar with in terms of making a case. When we reach the point of asking for witnesses, we feel that senators will be in more generous mood."
The House managers have a total of 24 hours to present their case, to be followed by a rebuttal from the President of up to 24 hours. Representative Charles T. Canady of Florida, one of the managers, said they faced a "strategic decision" on whether to use all their time because the Republicans don't want to "test the patience of those listening." House aides said tonight, though, that it appeared likely that the managers' presentation would spill over to Saturday.
Under the managers' current plan, subject to change, Mr. Hyde would make brief introductory remarks. Representative F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. of Wisconsin would then spend 40 to 50 minutes giving an overview of the House's case.
From there, the managers' case would be divided into three parts. One team of managers, which includes several former Federal prosecutors, would present the factual record, drawing heavily on the independent counsel's report.
This presentation, which would include Representatives Ed Bryant of Tennessee, Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, James E. Rogan of California and Bob Barr of Georgia, would last several hours.
Following that, Representative Bill McCollum of Florida would lead a team laying out the legal basis for the two articles of impeachment.
Once the managers linked the factual record to a legal framework, Mr. Canady and a group of managers would then argue that the charges against the President rise to offenses impeachable under the Constitution.
Finally, Mr. Rogan, Mr. Hyde and Representative George W. Gekas of Pennsylvania, will deliver the managers' closing arguments, with Mr. Hyde wrapping up.
 In each of these parts, but especially in factual presentation, the managers will highlight conflicting testimony that they believe requires the calling of witnesses for clarity.
The managers last week spoke of summoning as many as 18 witnesses, but lawmakers say they have narrowed that list to six or so. At the top of the list, managers say, are Ms. Lewinsky, Mrs. Curry and Vernon E. Jordan Jr., one of the President's confidants, who helped Ms. Lewinsky get a job in New York.

REVLON TO ELIMINATE AT LEAST 1,000 JOBS WORLDWIDE

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Revlon Inc., the largest United States maker of cosmetics sold in discount chains and drugstores, said yesterday that it would cut 1,000 to 1,200 jobs worldwide, or about 7 percent of its work force, to lower costs as sales decline. Revlon, which also sells Colorstay and Almay makeup, also said that lenders had agreed to waive terms in its credit agreement and that it would take a charge of about $80 million, including $40 million for the fourth quarter of 1998. Revlon, based in New York, is 83 percent owned by the New York investor Ronald O. Perelman. The company's sales have been hurt by loss of consumer buying power in Asia, Russia and Latin America as well as inventory cutbacks at American drugstores.

HEADLINE: OLYMPICS;
Jobs in Salt Lake City Questioned by I.O.C.

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN 

 BODY:
Relatives of International Olympic Committee members from Ecuador and Finland were employed by the Salt Lake City bid committee while it pursued the 2002 Winter Games, Olympic officials said yesterday.
A daughter of Agustin Carlos Arroyo, an I.O.C. member from Ecuador, and the husband of Pirjo Haggman, an I.O.C. member from Finland, worked briefly for the bid committee, Olympic officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity. These revelations were the latest in a growing scandal involving cash payments, tuition aid and lavish gifts in which vote-buying by Salt Lake City officials has been alleged by Marc Hodler, a senior I.O.C. member from Switzerland. 
 Arroyo's daughter worked for a couple of weeks for the Utah Department of Economic Development as a commercial artist, but her skills were found to be lacking, an Olympic official said. She was then hired to answer phones for the Salt Lake City bid committee for a month and was eventually given tuition aid to attend school in Texas for about six months and might have received living expenses, the Olympic official said. The official said that the daughter was hired without her father's urging or apparent knowledge.
Reached by telephone yesterday in Guayaquil, Ecuador, Arroyo said that his stepdaughter, Nancy Rignault, who is an American citizen, had worked briefly in Salt Lake City a restoration project before returning to Texas, but that he was positive she had not worked for the bid committee. He later said he was not sure and would check on the matter "because I have nothing to hide."
Arroyo, 75, a lawyer and industrialist and an I.O.C. member since 1968, also said that he might have received cash from the bid committee, but that it would have been as reimbursement for travel expenses he and his wife, Raquel, incurred when they visited Salt Lake City before the June 1995 vote in which it was awarded the 2002 Games.
It is customary for Olympic bid cities to provide first-class air fare for I.O.C. members and a guest when they make three-day inspection visits. Arroyo said that the total cost of the two first-class tickets might have been $5,000. He said it was his habit to buy his own tickets when traveling and then to be reimbursed.
"That's the only thing that could have been given to me in cash," he said, adding that he had received nothing else from Salt Lake City officials other than customary hotel accommodations, meals and small gifts like a watch and a necktie.
Also during the bid process, Haggman's husband was hired to do an environmental study for the Salt Lake City committee, an Olympic official said. The official said the couple were separated at the time. Haggman, 47, an I.O.C. member since 1981, did not respond to a fax seeking comment.
Also yesterday, Salt Lake City Mayor Deedee Corradini said that she would not seek a third term in office. Corradini, who was active in securing the 2002 Winter Games, has denied knowing of any wrongdoing in the mushrooming Olympic scandal and said it played no role in her decision not to seek re-election.
Hodler told The Associated Press yesterday that public and corporate discontent could force the 2002 Games to be moved from Salt Lake City or canceled. However, the I.O.C. leadership has stated firmly that it does not intend to move the Games from Salt Lake City. Officials of the United States Olympic Committee have said they can raise enough money to satisfy a $1.45 billion budget for the Games.
"We fully anticipate the Winter Games of 2002 will be held in Salt Lake City," said Bill Hybl, president of the U.S.O.C.
Tom Welch, who was president of the Salt Lake City bid committee, has acknowledged paying $50,000 in cash to Jean-Claude Ganga, an I.O.C. member from Congo Republic, to be used for children there. Investigators have said that Ganga received payments totaling $70,000. One Olympic official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said yesterday that $20,000 paid to Ganga had been claimed by the bid committee as reimbursement for travel expenses.
Welch has repeatedly denied any attempt to bribe I.O.C. members. In a weekend interview with French radio, Ganga denied any wrongdoing.
Ganga said that a profitable land deal arranged for him by Bennie Smith, a member of the Salt Lake City bid committee, several months after Salt Lake City won the Games, was normal. Because the land deal occurred after the vote on the site, Ganga told French radio, "it couldn't have influenced me."
Ganga said Salt Lake City won the 2002 Games, not by bribery, but "because they were the best."
 
 
Bribery Charge Denied
 SANTIAGO, Chile, Jan. 11 (Agence France-Presse) -- Sergio Santander Fantini, the president of the Chilean Olympic Committee and a member of the International Olympic Committee, denied today that he had accepted bribes from the Salt Lake City bid committee in connection with the awarding of the 2002 Winter Games.
In The Deseret News of Salt Lake City today, Tom Welch, who headed the bid committee, said that he contributed $10,000 to Santander's mayoral campaign, but "we never bribed anybody." Santander said, "I never received any money, nothing."

HEADLINE: U.S. More Isolated In U.N. on Keeping The Iraq Sanctions

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 11

 BODY:
The United States is finding itself increasingly isolated in its Iraq policy as a growing number of Security Council members and Arab nations support lifting an embargo on Iraqi oil sales or significantly relaxing sanctions in other ways to relieve the suffering of the Iraqi people.
But contrary to what the Iraqis may hope, there is also solid agreement that long-term international supervision is needed to prevent Iraq from acquiring or developing prohibited weapons. Among proposals to be discussed are the creation of a new inspection system and ways to monitor money that Iraq would earn if it sold oil freely. 
 The Clinton Administration wants to retain the existing system and the right to use the military to enforce it, although a majority of Security Council members oppose further use of force without Council approval.
Washington has focused on keeping sanctions in force until Iraq complies with all disarmament requirements. The United States would be willing only to expand a program that allows Iraq to sell a limited amount of oil to buy food, medicine and other necessities.
Peter Burleigh, the American representative on the Council, said in an interview tonight that undoing existing resolutions that govern those policies would not be easy and that no other delegation has proposed a concrete way to make the changes.
"The whole body of what I think everyone would agree is international law can't just be wished away," he said. "The disarmament issue is the key to the lifting of sanctions."
"I am not convinced that the proposals for the lifting of sanctions are actually gaining a wide momentum," he said. "While there are various delegations and governments that are making comments about the lifting of sanctions or the modification of sanctions, how those would relate to the body of resolutions pertaining to Iraq is not at all clear."
Although any change in Security Council policies could be blocked by an American veto, Washingtonwants the backing of the Council and does not want to find itself alone. Administration officials have also acknowledged that if the United States uses its veto to keep sanctions in force, over time they could erode.
Some Council members say the debate is an urgent one because there are no inspectors in Iraq now and no work is being done there. Today the chief arms inspector, Richard Butler, said that he had suspended surveillance flights by American U-2's and French aircraft while the Security Council discusses the crisis. But the Council has no timetable for the discussions, which could take weeks or even months.
The United States is finding that the core group opposed to its policies on Iraq -- formed around Russia, China, France and sometimes Brazil -- has strengthened with the entry of at least two new Council members, Malaysia and Namibia, which will hold two-year seats.
American diplomats are also watching Canada and the Netherlands, two other new members, for signs of where they will stand. In Amsterdam today, the Dutch representative on the United Nations Special Commission to disarm Iraq supported the view that sanctions could be rewritten while the arms inspections system remained in place.
The commissioner, Koos Ooms, said this would rebuild unity in the Security Council and "would at least snatch away from Saddam Hussein the weapon of being able to say that the Iraqi people are suffering because of the sanctions."
The French Government says it is preparing new proposals for the Council to end the oil embargo but institute other controls. Lifting the embargo could change Iraqi lives in many ways, depending on the terms of any agreement. It would put money back into the economy, which could, for instance, increase purchasing power or allow imports of consumer goods.
Even the British, the strongest ally of the United States on Iraq policy, now favor a new inspection system, Prime Minister Tony Blair said today in an open letter to the French newspaper Liberation.
Mr. Butler, the chief arms inspector, acknowledged today that a change in the inspection system seems inevitable. Speaking at an arms control conference in Washington, he said whatever system emerges from the Council "would be a bit different from the past."
Today in Moscow, Russia's Foreign Ministry called again for the dismissal of Mr. Butler, the executive chairman of the Special Commission, after reports last week that the United States used the commission for espionage. The commission, known as Unscom, has been responsible for disarming Iraq since 1991. The sanctions, imposed in 1990 after Iraq invaded Kuwait, were linked to arms inspections at the end of the Persian Gulf war.
Secretary General Kofi Annan defended Mr. Butler today. "I don't think the issue is Butler," he told reporters, after repeating that he had no evidence that Mr. Butler had cooperated with United States in spying on Iraq. "I don't think the issue is Unscom. We are dealing with much larger issues about compliance of Iraq and stability in the region."
Mr. Blair, in his letter to Liberation, wrote that Britain agreed with the United States that an expansion of the "oil for food" program would be the best way to aid Iraqi civilians. Iraq is now permitted to sell up to $5.2 billion in oil every six months.
"We are holding talks with France and other eminent members of the Security Council to find a formula allowing monitoring to resume in Iraq," he wrote, "but under a new system that would avoid the inspectors' presence creating a new crisis every three months."
For the Council, the problem is how to separate sanctions issues from disarmament without giving any ground, real or psychological, to President Hussein, whom even some Arab nations now openly condemn. Furthermore, no one has put forward a plan for winning Iraq's cooperation or creating an enforcement system.
The Council will meet on Tuesday to look at the relief situation in Iraq, its president for January, Celso L. N. Amorim of Brazil, said today. "Before we're able to address the broader political issues of Iraq," he said, "we have to address some concrete steps that can be taken both on the humanitarian file and the disarmament file."
For the Arabs, the moment is particularly delicate, said Clovis Maksoud, a former Arab League representative at the United Nations who is now director of the Center for the Global South at American University in Washington. He said recent American and British actions -- including the December air strikes and possible misuse of the Special Commission for spying by Washington -- have created crises in both the United Nations and the Arab League.
While there are Arab leaders who would like to see Mr. Hussein out of power, they would have trouble supporting more American attacks and could not back an overthrow from outside, Mr. Maksoud said.
But among the Arabs, Mr. Maksoud said, there would be great support for a change in sanctions that helped free, at least economically, the Iraqi middle class while arms control inspections remained.

HEADLINE: '98 Medicare Growth Slowest Since Program Began in '65

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 11

 BODY:
The growth of Medicare slowed to a virtual halt last year as spending in the giant health insurance program for the elderly rose by just 1.5 percent, the smallest increase since the beginning of the program in 1965, new Government data show.
The slower rate of growth will probably add a few years to the life of the Medicare trust fund that pays hospital bills for the elderly. And it may temporarily relax the pressure on Congress to redesign the program. But, officials said, it does not fundamentally alter the long-term outlook for Medicare, which will incur immense new costs as baby boomers become eligible after 2010. 
 For the first time, Medicare spending last year grew more slowly than the Federal budget as a whole, which increased by 3 percent.
The slowdown shows the effects of Congressional curbs on payments to hospitals and home health care agencies, and the results of a Federal crusade against Medicare fraud.
In the last decade, Medicare spending rose by an average of $12.8 billion, or 10 percent, a year. But in 1998, it grew just $3.1 billion, to a total of $213.6 billion, according to recent statements of Federal spending from the Treasury Department.
"While we are all rightly concerned about the growth of future costs, Medicare right now is amazingly well behaved," said Robert D. Reischauer, former director of the Congressional Budget Office. "Nobody is really sure why Medicare spending has slowed down quite as much as it has. The only thing we can be sure of is that it won't last."
The number of Medicare beneficiaries grew last year by slightly more than 1 percent, to 39 million. So the average increase in Medicare spending for each beneficiary was close to zero, budget experts said.
The experts offer several explanations. Congress intentionally curbed payments to hospitals, home health agencies and other health care providers in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, and the savings so far have exceeded expectations.
Doctors and hospitals have historically absorbed cutbacks without reducing services to patients, but there is evidence that some beneficiaries are having difficulty gaining or keeping access to home health care.
In an interview today, William A. Dombi, vice president of the National Association for Home Care, said, "To stay within their Medicare budgets, home health agencies are avoiding higher-cost patients, chronically ill patients and those who need the most care."
Federal efforts to curb fraud and abuse also appear to have slowed the growth of Medicare. Health care executives said the Federal investigation of the Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation had sent a chill through the hospital industry and encouraged greater compliance by health care providers of all types, including doctors, who fear prosecution for submitting false claims.
Congress has pumped money into such investigations for several years, and June Gibbs Brown, inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services, has led a crackdown on Medicare fraud.
Thomas A. Scully, president of the Federation of American Health Systems, which represents 1,400 for-profit hospitals, said: "People in hospitals, the billing clerks and their supervisors, are generally scared to death of being investigated for billing errors, accidental or intentional. Revenues are dropping because hospitals are being ultraconservative in their billing practices."
Medicare's growth last year was significantly slower than that of private health insurance plans. In a recent survey of 207 large employers, Towers Perrin, a management consulting concern, found that the cost of employee health benefits increased 4 percent on average last year, with an increase of 7 percent forecast for this year.
In January 1998, the Congressional Budget Office predicted that Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, which pays hospital bills for the elderly, would run out of money in 2010. But health policy experts now say the trust fund will probably not be depleted until after 2012.
The trust fund had been expected to lose $4 billion in 1998, but instead it posted a surplus of nearly $1 billion, according to the Treasury statements. The trust fund's revenues, mainly from payroll taxes, were $2 billion higher than expected, thanks to a strong economy, and spending was $3 billion less than projected by the Congressional Budget Office.
Spending from the hospital trust fund declined last year by one-half of one percent, to $136.7 billion. Spending for doctors' services and other items covered by a separate fund rose by 5.1 percent, to $76.3 billion.
Marilyn Moon, a public trustee of the Medicare trust funds, said, "The 1997 Balanced Budget Act will do more than people thought to hold down Medicare costs." For example, she said, "spending on home health care declined from 1997 to 1998."
Delays in the payment of claims may also have slowed the growth of Medicare spending last year. Federal officials and Government contractors are taking more time to scrutinize claims for errors and fraud, and these delays may have been exacerbated by changes in Medicare computer systems, needed to get ready for the year 2000.
Small amounts of Medicare spending may thus have been shifted from 1998 to 1999. Government data show a greater lag between the time patients are treated and the time Medicare pays hospitals, nursing homes and home health agencies. It is unclear whether delays will continue.
In tracking spending, the Government measures the average complexity, or cost, of all the Medicare cases at each hospital. This "case mix index," which rose every year from 1983 to 1997, declined last year, Medicare officials said.
Federal spending on Medicaid, the health program for poor people, which also pays for large amounts of nursing home care, rose last year by 5.9 percent, to $101 billion, larger than the rises of an average of 3.6 percent a year in 1995 and 1996. But, apart from those years, it was the smallest increase since 1984.
The steep decline in welfare rolls has contributed to a decline in the number of Medicaid recipients, holding down Medicaid costs.

HEADLINE: WHITMAN EXPECTS TO OFFER REBATES ON PROPERTY TAX

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 11

 BODY:
Under pressure to address New Jersey's high property taxes, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman was expected to outline a five-year, $1 billion plan on Tuesday that would eventually provide average rebates of $600 to homeowners.
The plan would use money from the state's general fund to cover part of the homeowners' local school taxes, which now make up 55 to 65 percent of the average property tax bill. The proposal would not change how much money local school districts receive, because it would provide the rebates using state tax revenue. 
 While lawmakers, both Democrats and Republicans, say they embrace efforts to reduce the property tax burden on homeowners, some expressed concern about whether the state would be able to afford rebates if an economic slowdown occurred. The state's strong economy has helped produce a projected $800 million budget surplus that would cover the $200 million cost of the program in the first year. The cost of the program would rise to $1 billion in 2004.
"It certainly is an intriguing proposal," said Assemblyman Anthony N. Impreveduto, a Democrat from Secaucus. "The question is, how are we paying for it? The economy is robust now. Unfortunately, the economy is like hemlines. It rises and it falls. But I am glad that she has finally listened to us to do something about property taxes. I think Democrats would certainly consider being supportive of this."
Although Mrs. Whitman won national attention for cutting the state's income taxes when she first took office five years ago, she nearly lost her re-election bid in 1997 because of voter anger over paying the nation's highest auto insurance and property taxes. The average property tax bill in New Jersey is $4,000.
Governor Whitman and state lawmakers already took steps last year to ease auto insurance rates for some drivers. On Tuesday, Mrs. Whitman will make the property tax plan the centerpiece of her annual address to a joint session of the State Legislature. In the speech, she was expected to ask state officials to recommit themselves to what she describes as the core Republican values of cutting taxes and controlling spending.
Mrs. Whitman was also expected to embrace a proposal by the Senate President, Donald T. DiFrancesco, that would provide more state aid to municipalities to help them keep up with rising costs caused by inflation. Mr. DiFrancesco, a Republican, is widely expected to seek the gubernatorial nomination in three years. The Governor was also expected to announce her support for a proposal by Assembly Speaker Jack Collins, a Republican who is also considering making a gubernatorial bid. Mr. Collins's plan would eliminate state income taxes for residents earning $13,000 annually or less.
On property taxes, Mrs. Whitman has already taken some steps to reduce the state's high rates. She is encouraging school districts to share costs and has also signed legislation that freezes the amount of property taxes that low-income elderly and disabled homeowners now pay. She also signed legislation that once again allows New Jerseyans to deduct part of their property taxes from their state income tax bills.
Although critics warned that the 30 percent income tax cut in early 1994 would significantly reduce state aid to local governments and drive up property taxes, Mrs. Whitman points out that the overall property tax collection statewide has slowed.
But homeowners and local officials have continued to put pressure on Mrs. Whitman and lawmakers to take more aggressive steps, because property tax rates are still sharply rising in some towns. Under the proposal, tenants would receive average rebates of $20 this year, increasing to $100 by the fifth year, Whitman administration officials said.
"This is the most sweeping property tax reform that this state has ever experienced," said Pete McDonough, Mrs. Whitman's spokesman. "It will cut the average school tax bill by more than a third."
The tax rebate proposal is by far the most extensive effort that the Governor has taken to address a longstanding complaint of New Jersey property owners. It is similar to a $2.7 billion property tax program that Gov. George E. Pataki, a fellow Republican, proposed and signed into law in 1997. But the major difference is that property owners in New Jersey would get a check directly from the state.
In New York, homeowners can see the reduction on their property tax bill, but the state writes the check to the local school district to make up the difference. The Pataki administration's plan is scheduled to be fully phased in by the 2001-2002 school year. In New Jersey, the rebates would be fully in place in 2004.
Both plans are intended to recalculate the school-tax portion of the local property tax bills but keep school spending levels the same. Both plans exempt part of the assessed value of a home from the school tax rate to calculate rebates. In New York, it is the first $30,000 of assessed value for all homeowners. In New Jersey, the first $45,000 of assessed value would be removed from the formula for the school district tax rate.
For several years, many New Jersey homeowners did receive rebate checks to cover a portion of their property tax bills until the program was scaled back by lawmakers in 1992 to help pay for a cut in the sales tax. The state still maintains what is called a homestead rebate program for disabled and low-income homeowners and tenants.
When Mrs. Whitman's program is fully phased in after five years, the rebate checks would average about $600 and would be available to property owners regardless of income. Starting this year, the proposal would phase in the rebates at 20 percent a year. The first rebates would average $120.
By 2004, homeowners in Livingston, Essex County, where the average assessed value of a home is $75,000, would receive an average rebate check of $624 from the state. In Montclair, where the average home is assessed at $247,000, the average rebate check would amount to $778.
Frank Belluscio, a spokesman for the New Jersey School Boards Association, said that local school district officials were likely to embrace the plan because it would not adversely affect their budgets. "Our position has always been that the state has to increase its share of public school spending if we are going to have true property tax relief," he said. "This is a direct approach."

Residential Property Shows Loss in Value

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Manhattan residential real estate prices dipped in the fourth quarter -- the first decline in more than a year -- amid concern about the stock market, according to a study by Halstead Property Company.
The average price per room for Halstead's Manhattan Index of residential properties below 96th Street fell 2 percent to $158,601 in the quarter that ended Dec. 31. The price per room in the Silk Stocking section of Manhattan, which the company defines as Fifth Avenue, Central Park West and Park Avenue, fell 1.4 percent to $322,665, the company said. 
 "The stock market volatility at the end of the third quarter had buyers thinking the great bull market in property values was coming to an end," said Clark Halstead, founder of the New York-based real estate brokerage. "With economic indicators actually stronger than they've been in a year or so, we're likely to have a robust year through this winter."
Mr. Halstead said the fourth-quarter numbers reflected a delayed response to the stock market rout in the third quarter, when the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 10 percent. The index has since recovered, rising 21 percent in the fourth quarter.
Over all, 1998 was a good year for residential real estate in Manhattan. The average price per room rose 16 percent for the year. For the Silk Stocking district, the average price per room rose 13.5 percent.
Studio apartments witnessed the greatest price appreciation, rising 21 percent in the year.
At the end of 1998, the most expensive residential real estate in Manhattan was Fifth Avenue, at $404,669 per room.

HEADLINE: Where Indulgence Grows on Trees

BYLINE: By MARIAN BURROS 

DATELINE: HILO, Hawaii

 BODY:
THE coast of Hawaii's Big Island is dotted with groves of stately trees, their shiny, dark green leaves forming shady canopies over the rich volcanic soil. They stand in lush contrast to the white-capped blue waters of the Pacific. From late fall to early winter, these trees, descendants of a species imported from Australia in the 1870's as an ornamental, produce graceful sprays of white blossoms that have a gentle perfume, like privet hedges in bloom.
But the trees give off much more than shade and fragrance: from July through January they yield macadamias, the world's richest tasting, most expensive nut, a food as closely associated with Hawaii as the pineapple. The discovery that the trees were more than just ornamental had to be sheer happenstance, because the luxury they produce is one hard nut to crack. Still, once the secret was out, every effort was made to turn the trees into tidy profit centers. 
 It took a long, long time. And now, growers are worried that macadamia farms, like sugar cane and pineapple plantations before them, are facing demise. Until the early 1990's macadamia acreage was expanding into farmland that had once grown those earlier crops. Today the acreage, much of it between Hilo and Kailua-Kona, is either static or in slight decline, depending on whom you ask.
Macadamia nuts -- macnuts to Hawaiians -- do not share the American culinary tradition of walnuts or pecans. It was not until the 1920's that anyone tried to raise them commercially in Hawaii. Mainland America didn't really hear about them until the 1970's, and that was mostly by word of mouth, after visitors to Hawaii discovered the macadamias' charms and brought them home as gifts.
Their cachet reached its peak in the 1980's when John Hillerman, who acted in the television series "Magnum, P.I.," became a spokesman for Mauna Loa, the state's largest grower and processor: "Mauna Loa macadamia nuts -- almost too good to share."
Maybe chefs took that motto to heart; they are not as freewheeling with macadamias as they are with other nuts. What appeals to them about macadamias is not so much the subtle flavor, which is at its best when the nuts are not lost in a tangle of competing ingredients, but the texture, the crunchiness, the butteriness.
At his restaurants in Honolulu, Sam Choy uses crushed macadamias in dozens of dishes, including baked Brie and as breading for chicken. Michel Richard of Citronelle in Washington likes them in pies. In Manhattan, Claudia Fleming, the pastry chef at Gramercy Tavern, serves a macadamia nut tartlet with roasted pineapple and vanilla rum ice cream, while Florian Bellanger of Le Bernardin combines them with pistachios and pecans in a pineapple crumble.
But mostly, macadamia nuts are eaten as an extravagant snack -- on their own, in cookies, coated with milk or dark chocolate, in nut brittle and truffles, honey roasted and flavored with Maui onion or garlic. Yet, they remain a relatively exotic ingredient.
Outside Hawaii, few Americans would even recognize a macadamia in its shell -- the nut resembles a rock-hard malted-milk ball. Today, Hawaii, with 700 farms on 20,200 acres, produces 99 percent of the macadamia nuts grown in the United States (California produces the rest); last year 65 million pounds were harvested.
Macadamias can be found in almost any large supermarket, but they are usually a special-occasion purchase because they have two strikes against them: their price and their richness. Richard Vidgen, the president of Macfarms of Hawaii, the second-largest grower and processor, is well aware of that problem.
"After enough people said, 'They are my favorite nut; they are terribly expensive; they are terribly fattening,' I realized we had an image problem," he said. "People thought the nuts were sinful."
Hawaiian growers have been working to improve the nutritional image for several years, capitalizing on the increasing awareness that not all fat is bad fat. Much to their chagrin, though, growers in other countries have been working to reduce the price, to the point where Hawaiians have lost their lock on the market as foreign nuts undercut them.
It took Australia more than a century to realize the profitability of its native tree, but over the last 10 years it has become a major exporter, especially to Southeast Asia. South Africa, China, Malaysia, Guatemala, Brazil and other countries have also been cashing in.
Between 1992 and 1997, Hawaii's 50 percent share of the world market declined to 36 percent, while Australia's share rose to 38 percent, from 27 percent. Since the market in Southeast Asia collapsed, amid the Asian economic troubles, Australian growers have been selling their nuts in the United States below the price of Hawaiian nuts. Some island growers fear they may go out of business.
Hawaiians naturally insist their nuts are the best -- "the beluga of macadamia nuts," said Richard Schnitzler, the president of the Hamakua Macadamia Nut Company in Kailua-Kona. Many Hawaiian chefs agree, and after tasting nuts from Australia and Malaysia, so do I. But most consumers from the American mainland to Europe and Asia don't know a Hawaiian macadamia nut from a Guatemalan and don't care. And that is not good for growers in Hawaii.
"We thought it was glamorous in 1985 to grow macadamia nuts," said Midge Mebane, who with her husband, John, is one of the many small growers. Six of their 12 acres overlooking Hilo are planted with macadamia trees because the agricultural use of the land gives them a large tax break.
"Otherwise, it would have been prohibitive," said Mrs. Mebane, a disarmingly direct woman, who moved from Pennsylvania with her husband 27 years ago.
"When we started, the price of macadamia nuts was 92 cents a pound, but now it's 50 cents a pound," she said. "I did not envision the costs. Our trees are now 11 years old, and we are sort of breaking even. I thought it was a good investment, but we really haven't made any money because we have to bring in so many people to pick."
Like most small growers, the Mebanes have another source of income: John Mebane is a physician in Hilo.
The road from tree to table is long and complicated. A grower who plants a tree has to wait seven years before it will produce enough nuts to sell; it will not be profitable for five to eight more years.
The trees, which grow to 30 feet, were originally described scientifically in the mid-19th century by an Australian botanist, Baron Ferdinand von Mueller, who named them in honor of a friend, Dr. John Macadam. In 1921, the first macadamia plantation was started near Honolulu, but it was not very successful. It took 20 years of research to select and graft the varieties that reliably produce a desirable nut.
Today, there are seven varieties grown at different elevations in various climates, almost all of them on the Big Island. Macadamia trees live 45 or 50 years, although some are at least 110 and still fruitful.
Once the rock-hard nuts are ripe, they still have to be shelled, which growers used to do by laying a board over them, then running a car over that. Unlike other nuts, which are picked at one time of the year, macadamias ripen in waves and have to be harvested five or six times.
Growers wait until they fall to the ground in their green husks, then gather them either mechanically or by hand. Mrs. Mebane described the latter method as "an amazing sight."
"The pickers walk around on kneepads for hours at a time," she said. They also have to be sure to get to the nuts ahead of the rats and wild pigs, which figured out how to crack them long before humans did.
At the processing plants, each load of nuts is weighed and then husked, sorted, washed and put in air drying tanks. The shells are removed mechanically, in a crusher using 300 pounds of pressure per square inch. The meats are sorted first by machines, then by humans. The last steps are dry-roasting and grading. The larger the nut, the higher the grade.
Along with Mauna Loa and Macfarms, Island Princess and Hamakua Macadamia Nut Farms account for 80 percent of the nuts grown in Hawaii. Most of the other farms are small; only 200 farms are 20 acres or more.
"There are people with only two trees who call themselves growers," said David Rietow, the president of the Hawaiian Macadamia Nut Association, whose membership produces most of the nuts grown in Hawaii. "We call them shade-tree growers." Only 10 percent of these small growers farm full time.
Like many growers, Yoshitaka Takashiba has acreage in both coffee and nuts on the coast near Kona. Born and raised on a coffee farm, Mr. Takashiba, who is 85 and still drives a tractor, was a macadamia pioneer in the 1970's. "At that time there weren't too many buyers," he said. "But I made better money than farmers who had coffee."
The father of three daughters, Mr. Takashiba, who may be slow of foot but is quick of wit, said, "When the girls left home, they vowed they would never come back because I abused them." Read: They had to do farm chores.
Now that he is older and his children do his tax returns, he said, they know how much his land is worth and have told him not to sell it, because they are coming back. Like many farmers, his riches are in land, land that others want to turn into housing tracts.
Mr. Vidgen, of Macfarms, is optimistic about the competition Hawaiian growers face.
"We can overcome higher labor costs by being smarter with technology," he said. "Land costs are not that high. We get yields similar to Australia but higher than other countries. We'll keep coming up with new ideas."
One way has been to try to improve the "too fattening" image of macadamias, which contain 200 calories and 19 grams of fat per ounce, while an ounce of pecans has 167 calories and 15 grams of fat. Peanuts have slightly less.
But much of the scientific research sponsored by the International Tree Nut Council has been directed at proving that nuts in general are beneficial for health because they contain the "good" kinds of fat, mono unsaturated or polyunsaturated. Several recent studies suggest that nuts help reduce "bad" cholesterol. To reinforce a more healthful image, Macfarms sponsors an Ironman triathlete from Hawaii.
The costly image is harder to battle, especially when labels don't distiguish between Hawaiian and Australian macadamias. Even Rocco Damato, whose company, A. L. Bazzini in New York, has been selling nuts since 1886, says he would have a hard time telling the two apart. He usually sells Australian, but sometimes Hawaiian or Costa Rican.
One of his clients, Bill Yosses, the pastry chef at Bouley Bakery, had no idea where the nuts he uses in a dacquoise come from.
He assumed they were Hawaiian.
As recently as the late the 1980's, he would have been right. "Eight or 10 years ago prices were so good we felt we had it made," said Sotero Agoot, the director of Kona Pacific Farmers Cooperative in Captain Cook. "We quit advertising; we quit marketing. We've dropped the ball."
 
The Proof Is in the Tasting
 AFTER sampling macadamia nuts from Hawaii, Malaysia and Australia, I'll go along with the Hawaiians, who think theirs are best.
The Hawaiian nuts had a subtle, sweet taste. The ones from Malaysia were rancid. Two samplings of Australian nuts provided different results: one bag was slightly rancid; the other was good, but still not as sweet or as full-flavored as the Hawaiian nuts. They were almost as crunchy but a trifle oilier.
When Florian Bellanger, the pastry chef at Le Bernardin, tasted Australian and Hawaiian macadamias side by side, he, too, preferred the Hawaiian.
So how can you be sure you are getting Hawaiian nuts? It's difficult. If the label on the can says "product of Hawaii" or "Hawaiian grown," chances are fairly good, though not 100 percent, that they will be Hawaiian. If there is nothing on the label -- even if the packaging looks as if it comes from Hawaii -- there is absolutely no way to be sure.
When buying nuts in bulk you have to trust what the store people tell you, if in fact they know. Be sure to sample one before purchasing.
At Balducci's, Dean & DeLuca, Eli's Manhattan, Eli's Vinegar Factory and Grace's Marketplace, the unsalted macadamia nuts are usually from Australia, sometimes from Costa Rica and sometimes from Hawaii. Prices vary. A pound of whole macadamia nuts is $13 at Dean & DeLuca and $10.95 at the Vinegar Factory. Cans of nuts in smaller amounts cost more.
You can buy excellent fresh unsalted Hawaiian macadamias by mail from Island Bakery and Grocery Supply. P.O. Box 1798, Kaunakakai, Hawaii 96748; (808) 567-6517; checks, money orders and Visa accepted. A pound of whole nuts is $8, halves are $7 and diced are $6 plus shipping by priority mail: $2 for one pound, but the more you buy, the cheaper the cost per pound. MARIAN BURROS
 
Making the Most of Macadamias
 MACADAMIA nuts are best used in cooking for their crunch and their rich butteriness rather than for their subtle flavor, which actually disappears when the nuts are mixed with too many other ingredients.
Crushed macadamias do make an excellent coating for rack of lamb, especially when combined with herbs de Provence, and for skinless chicken breasts, pork tenderloin and lean fish.
Substituting macadamia nuts for pecans in a pie brings out their flavor, as does a coating of a superb dark chocolate.
Toasting the nuts at 300 degrees until they are very lightly browned intensifies the flavor. If they get too brown, they lose their sweetness.
 
BAKED BRIE WITH MACADAMIA NUTS
Adapted from "Sam Choy's Island Flavors," by Sam Choy (Hyperion, 1999)
Time: 20 minutes plus 30 minutes chilling time
1/2 cup finely chopped toasted macadamia nuts
 1/2 cup panko (Japanese bread crumbs) or fine dry bread crumbs
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 large egg, lightly beaten
2 small rounds of Brie, 4 1/2 ounces each (leave rind on)
Spicy mango chutney (see recipe)
Lavash, toasted pita or other crisp bread for garnish
1 apple, thinly sliced, for garnish.
 1. Combine the macadamia nuts and panko in a shallow dish. Place the flour in another shallow dish, and the beaten egg in a third.
2. Cut each round of Brie into quarters. Dip each piece first into the flour, turning to coat the cheese evenly, then into the egg, letting any excess drip away, and finally into the macadamia mixture, patting it on to help it adhere. Chill the cheese for 30 minutes.
3. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Put the cheese quarters in a baking pan, and bake for 10 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown. Transfer carefully to a platter, and serve hot with the chutney, lavash and apple slices.
Yield: 4 servings.
 
SPICY MANGO CHUTNEY
Time: 45 minutes
 
 1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar
2 tablespoons cider vinegar
2 teaspoons minced garlic
2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger
2 ripe mangoes, 1 pound each
 1/2 cup golden raisins
1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
2 teaspoons coarse-grain mustard
 1/4 teaspoon salt
 1/4 teaspoon hot Asian chili paste like sambal oelek.
1. In a medium saucepan, combine the sugar, vinegar, garlic and ginger, and simmer for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, peel the mangoes, and dice into 1/2-inch cubes.
2. Add the mango and remaining ingredients to the saucepan, and simmer for 20 minutes more. Let cool. The chutney can be refrigerated for up to 1 week. Bring to room temperature before serving.
Yield: 2 cups.
 
ROASTED PINEAPPLE CRUMBLE WITH MACADAMIA NUTS
Adapted from Florian Bellanger, Le Bernadin
Time: 1 hour 45 minutes
 
For the pineapple:
1 cup granulated sugar
 
1 vanilla bean, sliced lengthwise, seeds scraped
6 quarter-size slices fresh ginger ( 1/2 ounce)
5 whole cloves, chopped
 1/4 cup mashed banana ( 1/2 large banana)
2 tablespoons dark rum
1 fresh pineapple, peeled
 
For the topping:
 3/4 cup macadamia nuts (3 ounces)
1 heaping tablespoon pecans
1 tablespoon pistachio nuts
1 cup all-purpose flour
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, cold, cut into pieces
3 tablespoons packed dark brown sugar
3 tablespoons granulated sugar
 1/2 teaspoon salt
 1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon
 1/8 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg.
1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. To prepare the pineapple, in a medium saucepan, combine the sugar, 1/4 cup hot water, the vanilla bean and scrapings, ginger and cloves. Stir the mixture over medium heat until the sugar dissolves. Increase the heat to medium-high, and cook the mixture until it is caramelized and dark golden brown, about 10 minutes.
2. Carefully add 1 1/4 cups hot water (the caramel will seize and bubble up, so stand back), banana and rum. Stir the mixture over low heat until the caramel is smooth.
3. Pour the caramel into a 9-by-9-by-2-inch pan. Add the pineapple, and roast it, turning it every 10 minutes, for a total of 50 minutes. Remove the pan to a wire rack, and let the pineapple cool in the caramel. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees.
4. While the pineapple is roasting, prepare the topping. Place the nuts on a baking sheet with a rim, and toast them in the oven with the pineapple for 8 to 10 minutes, until pale golden brown. Reserve 18 macadamia nuts, then coarsely chop the rest of the nuts.
5. In the bowl of a mixer set with the paddle attachment, combine the flour, butter, brown sugar, granulated sugar, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg. Stir the mixture on low speed until it resembles pebbles (do not overmix). Add the chopped nuts, and briefly mix them in.
6. When the pineapple is cool enough to handle, cut two 1/2-inch-thick slices from it, and cut the slices into quarters. Reserve for garnish. Cut the remaining pineapple lengthwise into quarters, and cut away the core. Dice the pineapple into 1/2-inch cubes.
7. Divide the pineapple among six 8-ounce ramekins. Drizzle 1 tablespoon of the caramel over each. Top with the crumble mixture, filling the ramekins to the top.
8. Bake the ramekins for about 17 minutes, or until the tops are golden brown. Serve warm, garnished with the reserved macadamia nuts and pineapple slices.
Yield: 6 servings.

HEADLINE: Gavin Relly, 72, Dies; Helped End Apartheid

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, Jan. 12

 BODY:
Gavin W. H. Relly, the retired chairman of the Anglo American Corporation who in 1985 led a delegation of business leaders to meet the banned African National Congress in Zambia, died on Sunday in Hermanus, South Africa. He was 72.
The cause of death was complications of cardiac surgery, a spokeswoman for the company said. 
 Mr. Relly's meeting with exiled leaders of the congress was important in efforts to end apartheid and the world sanctions that were slowly strangling the economy. Anglo American, then as now, was the largest conglomerate in South Africa and at the time accounted for more than half the market capitalization of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.
Its eagerness to talk to the congress signaled that business here was tentatively willing to defy the white Government and pursue a negotiated transition to black power and majority rule. At the time the National Party Government was killing A.N.C. advocates at home and abroad.
Mr. Relly, following the lead of the Oppenheimer family, which founded Anglo American and its sister companies De Beers Consolidated Mines and Minorco, was a critic of apartheid and endorsed creating opportunities for black South Africans, who were barred by law from the better-paying mine jobs.
At the same time he could be a tough executive. Beginning in the 1970's the Oppenheimers and their companies favored recognizing black trade unions. But in 1987, when the National Union of Mineworkers struck Anglo, whose gold, diamond, platinum and coal mines employed nearly 40 percent of the miners here, Mr. Relly dismissed 20,000 workers. Some were later rehired.
His successor as chairman, Julian Ogilvie Thompson, noted this week that Mr. Relly had run Anglo's copper interests in Zambia from 1965 to 1970, building up a relationship with President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia, who became the chief protector of the A.N.C. in exile. After that Mr. Relly worked for three years in Toronto as North American chief of Anglo.
"I think he brought back a clear understanding that South Africa was on the wrong course and ought to be on the right course," Mr. Thompson said.
After Nelson Mandela was released from prison in early 1990, Mr. Relly spent 40 minutes talking with him at his house in Soweto. In May 1990 the two led a joint business-A.N.C. conference on the economic shape of South Africa.
Mr. Relly had opposed sanctions in the apartheid era, arguing that they hurt blacks, as well as business, a view that the A.N.C. opposed. But Mr. Relly, who had watched Mr. Kaunda seize the company's rich copper mines and bleed them dry, also argued forcefully against nationalization as a means of redistributing wealth.
By 1994 the A.N.C. had dropped its socialist platform in favor of aggressive free-market capitalism, fiscal prudence and privatization as the engines of job creation.
Mr. Relly was born in Cape Town in 1926. He attended private schools there. In World War II he served with the South African Army in Italy. Like many Anglo executives, he then studied at Oxford.
After working for Sir de Villiers Graaff, leader of the opposition United Party, he joined Anglo American in 1949. He was private secretary to Harry Oppenheimer, the heir apparent, and then to the company founder, Sir Ernest Oppenheimer.
Mr. Relly helped develop gold mines so far south of Johannesburg that the company built a whole city, Welkom, to support. He oversaw the creation of the Highveld Steel and Vanadium subsidiary. After running other divisions at home and overseas, he succeeded Harry Oppenheimer as chairman in 1983 and retired in 1990.
He was a trustee of several South African universities, as well as a board member of the Worldwide Fund for Nature.
He is survived by his wife, Jane; three children, Janis, Georgina and Giles, and four grandsons.

HEADLINE: Editorial Observer;
What Will the Internet Economy Look Like?

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
The Internet is the wonder of the era, the tool that is expected to change everything. On Wall Street, Internet stocks are superstars. Amazon.com, the bookseller, now trades for more than 50 times the price at which it went public in 1997. Ebay, an auction house, is valued at 13 times what investors paid four months ago.
These prices reflect huge amounts of money. Amazon.com is valued at around $26 billion, about the same as CBS and nearly three times as much as Federated Department Stores, the largest department store chain. Yahoo, the Internet search engine that went public almost three years ago, is valued at about $39 billion, nearly 100 times its valuation when it went public and more than Boeing or Anheuser-Busch.
There are two possible explanations for those valuations. The market might be telling us that economic activity will soon come to be dominated by the Internet. Or the market moves could be evidence of speculation gone wild, of a great bubble that will inevitably burst. Those two explanations are not mutually exclusive. The Internet could be all that its fans expect, and some stocks could still be ridiculously overvalued.
But what would the 21st-century economy look like if only the first explanation proves accurate?
Retail activity would increasingly be dominated by Internet sales, to an extent hard to imagine. Federal Express would be an immediate beneficiary, assuming that Star Trek technology -- "Beam me up, Scotty" -- will not be perfected for packages. But while its stock did well last year, FedEx has slipped a bit this year, even as Internet stocks have zoomed. While Amazon.com fell 12 percent yesterday, it is up 53 percent for 1999.
Deflation would be likely in the new Internet economy. It is much easier to compare prices on the Internet, a fact that will tend to force prices -- and profit margins -- down on items that are easily comparable. One of the wonders of the performance of Amazon.com is that it specializes in just such products. A book from one store is no different than a book from another.
To be sure, service will also count. Getting a great price on something that does not get delivered for months is hardly a bargain. Brand-name images of quality could, if anything, become more important in a world where shoppers cannot examine the item before buying.
Some stores no doubt will continue to prosper. Lettuce does not age well, so food stores are an obvious candidate. For clothes, where fit is important, many will prefer to shop where they can try on before buying. No one will want to wait for mail delivery of a new car battery.
But over all the demand for stores would fall, creating a glut of retail space and falling rents as Internet sales represent transactions not made in stores.
So far, the stock market does not seem to have anticipated that. While companies that own shopping malls have seen their stock prices slip a bit, the falls have been nowhere near the magnitude that would be expected in the Internet economy.
Nor has the market anticipated the economic dislocations that would come along with such a huge change. A recession could easily result just from the upheavals created by failing retailers and plunging commercial real estate values. To say the least, the overall level of stock prices now does not reflect a recession risk.
The most likely outcome is that the Internet will grow to be a much larger economic force than it now is, but that the stocks of Internet companies will nonetheless prove to be horrid investments for those who buy at current prices. Those who are buying do not really expect such an economy. They are just betting that this mania will not end soon.
There is a precedent. In the 1920's, the great speculative stock was Radio Corporation of America, which took six years to rise 100-fold, twice the time Yahoo required. As the bulls forecast, R.C.A. became a dominant player in an industry that revolutionized American life. But those who bought the stock in 1929 still lost nearly all the money they invested.

HEADLINE: U.S. and China Discuss Human Rights

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 12

 BODY:
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said today that she is very disturbed by the crackdown on pro-democracy activists in China but that the administration must seek cooperation with China on strategic and other issues.
She spoke during a photo session with the Argentine Foreign Minister, Guido di Tella, as American and Chinese officials were holding a second and final day of talks on human rights issues. 
 Ms. Albright alluded to the increasing number of Chinese dissidents arrested in recent weeks.
She expressed concern about the trend and said Assistant Secretary of State Harold Koh was raising the issue with the Chinese delegation. But she said she expected Prime Minister Zhu Rongi of China to visit Washington this spring as planned.
"We expect the Prime Minister's visit to deal with very important issues that we have in the area of economic issues as well as the strategic dialogue," she said.
On Monday, the State Department spokesman, James P. Rubin, said that during the human rights talks, Mr. Koh planned to encourage the Chinese to ratify and abide by the United Nations Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
China signed the covenant last fall. Critics charge that repression has increased since then.

HEADLINE: Issue du Jour at Microsoft Trial: Are Consumers Harmed?

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 12

 BODY:
An economist testifying for the Government conceded today that there was scant evidence consumers had been harmed by practices that are central to the Justice Department's antitrust case against the Microsoft Corporation.
In antitrust doctrine, the damage to consumers from anticompetitive conduct is generally measured in higher prices and fewer choices of products. When asked whether consumers were being harmed by Microsoft's practices in the Internet software market, Franklin M. Fisher, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, replied that the question was difficult to answer. But after hesitating for a moment, he added, "On balance, I'd think that the answer is no, up to this point." 
Microsoft quickly seized on the comment by Mr. Fisher, the last Government witness, as support for the contention that the Justice Department and 19 states suing the company have been unable to show that consumers are being damaged by Microsoft's actions. William H. Neukom, the senior vice president for law and corporate affairs, said the Government's case was inspired by Microsoft competitors and based on the "raw speculation" that consumers might be harmed in some distant future if the company was not reined in.
But the Justice Department argues that it is sound public policy to intervene early in fast-moving high-technology industries when the predatory acts of a monopolist threaten to stifle innovation and consumer welfare in the long run -- and such, it contends, is the case with Microsoft.
With the prosecution case about to close, Joel I. Klein, the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Justice Department's antitrust division, appeared on the courthouse steps today to declare that the Government had presented "compelling evidence that Microsoft has engaged in a pattern of practices to crush any threat to its operating system monopoly."
The Government says that Microsoft bundled its Internet browser with its industry-standard Windows operating system, gave the browser away and unfairly used its market power to force personal computer makers and Internet service suppliers to agree to anticompetitive contracts. All this was done, the Government asserts, to thwart the challenge posed to Microsoft's dominance of the software industry by rivals led by the Netscape Communications Corporation, the early leader in browsing software, and Sun Microsystems Inc., creator of Java, an Internet programming language.
Microsoft replies that its contracts are routine business deals and that its product decisions have been guided mainly by its desire to improve its Windows operating system.
Mr. Fisher was still on the stand as court recessed today, even though the written testimony of the first defense witness for Microsoft was released Monday. That witness is Richard L. Schmalensee, an economist who is dean of M.I.T.'s Sloan School of Management. To speed up the trial, the court decided that the direct testimony of witnesses should be submitted in written form and released the afternoon before the witness is expected to take the stand for cross-examination.
In the afternoon, Mr. Fisher elaborated on his earlier remark about the effect of Microsoft's practices on consumers. He said consumers might suffer now from reduced choice because Microsoft's contracts make it more difficult for a rival's software to be distributed.
Still, the real problem, he argued, lies in the future, because Microsoft's monopoly in operating systems -- its Windows is shipped with 90 percent of all computers sold -- makes it a de facto gatekeeper on new technology in the personal computer market.
"Microsoft has shown that it will decide how innovation takes place in this industry," Mr. Fisher testified. The lesson from examining Microsoft's conduct in the browser market, he said, is that rivals "will be squashed."
Then, Mr. Fisher testified, "I don't think that's good for consumers, but those effects have only just begun."
The difficult-to-measure danger, he said, is largely prospective. "It won't be a consumer-driven society," Mr. Fisher declared. "It will be a Microsoft-driven society."
Under questioning from David Boies, the Justice Department's lead trial lawyer, Mr. Fisher sought to explain what some economists regard as an unanswered question in the Government's case: why the price of Windows is not higher.
Mr. Fisher replied that Microsoft was taking its "monopoly profits" not solely from the pricing of Windows but also from increased sales of Microsoft products that run on the Windows operating system -- its Office suite of business software, including word processing and spreadsheets, for example. The Windows pricing, he added, can also be explained as a discount to increase sales and thus strengthen the Microsoft monopoly.
At one point, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson interrupted to ask whether it was a "valid concept" that a monopolist might logically pursue a pricing strategy of "delayed gratification" to maximize its long-run gains.
"Oh, I think so," Mr. Fisher replied.
The Government will begin its cross-examination of Mr. Schmalensee, the lead-off defense witness, on Wednesday, a day later than anticipated.
Before it rests its case, the Government plans to introduce further excerpts from deposition testimony by William H. Gates, the Microsoft chairman, and several other industry executives as supporting evidence that Microsoft planned and executed a strategy to thwart competition.

HEADLINE: State Politics With a National Spin

BYLINE: By RICK LYMAN 

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex., Jan. 12

 BODY:
The Texas Legislature, which meets every other year for only 140 days, cranked up for business today with the prospect of a particularly lively stretch, even by Texas standards, of political theater.
Legislators assembled beneath the pink granite Capitol dome and were faced not only with a deliciously tempting budget surplus but also an extremely popular Republican Governor who, many believe, has a reasonable chance of becoming the country's next President. Even the outgoing Lieutenant Governor, Bob Bullock, a Democrat, introduced Gov. George W. Bush to the legislators today as "the future President of the United States." 
 Texas is far from alone in having a budget surplus. Building on a strong economy and a steady migration off the welfare rolls, states from the Atlantic to the Pacific find themselves with coffers bulging. The National Conference of State Legislators figures that state budgets are in their best shape since 1980.
How Texas may be different is that the struggle over what to do with that money -- how much will go to tax cuts and how much to education, as the argument has nearly always broken down when states have had surpluses in recent years -- will be played out through the prism of a Presidential campaign. And as Governors like Ronald Reagan, Michael S. Dukakis and Bill Clinton discovered, actions taken at the statehouse level can cast a disproportionately large shadow when refracted onto the national stage.
"I have not decided if I'm running yet; I'm still thinking about it," Governor Bush said this morning, sipping coffee and trying to shake the flu before his inaugural address next Tuesday. One foot was resting on the edge of his desk in the south wing of the Capitol, a working copy of the address on top of the stack of papers before him.
Yes, he said, he understands that the shadow of his potential Presidential bid will color much of what happens in Austin this spring. But rather than trying to calculate how to capitalize on it, he insists he is more concerned with minimizing the disruption.
"I ask myself, Will it disrupt the session?" Governor Bush said. "It will only disrupt the session if I'm not around, if the head of the appropriations committee wants to come meet with me and I'm off somewhere campaigning. So that's not going to happen."
The session is likely to end sometime in May, and he may well make his decision about the Presidency before then. But whatever the decision, the Governor said, he will not campaign until the session has ended.
"I'm not saying I'm not going to leave the state, but I'm not going to be campaigning," he said. "I'm going to stay here and get the job done."
Mr. Bush sometimes deflects questions about national issues by saying, as he did today, that he has no opinion to offer because "I'm not running for national office." But some national issues he does not mind talking about.
He was particularly glad, he said, to see Republican and Democratic senators standing side by side last week to announce their compromise on the handling of President Clinton's impeachment trial.
"First and foremost, the Senate has got to fulfill its duty, and they seem to be doing that in a very serious and proper way," he said.
The President's actions must be accounted for, he said, because the country will not be able to get out of its sex-and-scandal morass "as long as the current embarrassment is still on the national scene."
But he is not optimistic that, even if the trial is handled fairly and fully, the country and its elected leaders will immediately move on.
"I doubt it," the Governor said. "It's a cynical world. This will just be step one."
What is needed, he said, is a way to break the cycle of charges and counter charges involving sexual indiscretions and other tabloid topics.
"I think it's time for everyone to take a step back and say, Is this really what we want to put our country through?" the Governor said.
Several state legislators gathering today in the Capitol said they thought a potential Bush Presidential bid would have a marked effect on the outcome of the session, as political opponents try to make the Governor stumble or saddle him with a political albatross or as supporters bend over backward to provide him with a strong springboard for national office.
"I think a lot of people are interested in making the Governor look good," said Senator Bill Ratliff, a Republican from Mount Pleasant.
Last year, when Governor Bush was running for re-election, a race that he won handily, he and other statewide candidates made promises based on a projected budget surplus of $6.3 billion. Revised estimates place the surplus at $5.6 billion, so the Governor said some of those promises may have to be trimmed.
The problem, Mr. Ratliff said, is that the candidates raised expectations too high. A significant chunk of that $5.6 billion -- about $3.3 billion -- will need to pay for the 70,000 new public school students who arrive in Texas every year, before the remainder can be allocated for new programs or tax cuts.
"If you say it real fast, $2 billion sounds like a lot of money, but when you talk about a state the size of Texas, that's not as much money as you might think," Mr. Ratliff said.
Other potentially contentious subjects in the session include utility deregulation, school vouchers and limits on suburban expansion. But most in the Capitol said they thought the argument over the budget surplus would dominate the discussion.
"This will be a budget session," Governor Bush said. "And what happens when you have this kind of a budget, with a surplus, is that people start putting together a wish list. But there's not enough money to make everyone's wish come true."
In the campaign last year, he proposed sending $1 billion back to local school districts, with the "hope it goes for teachers salaries." Some opponents now are pushing for a direct, state-mandated raise.
"There is a suspicion in some people's minds that the money will turn into Astroturf and administrators' salaries," said Senator Teel Bivins, an Amarillo Republican and the new president pro tempore of the Senate.
Nevertheless, the Governor said, he does not want to bypass the local districts.
Mr. Bush said he also wanted to commit $200 million to help pay for the construction of new schools and for new textbooks and programs to fulfill his goal of teaching every child to read by the third grade.
While some are pushing for a drop in the state's 6.25 percent sales tax, Mr. Bush said he was more interested in property tax cuts (he advocated $2 billion for that during the election), state incentives for research and development, tax cuts for small businesses and an end to sales taxes for diapers and over-the-counter medications.
Despite the lower surplus projections, Mr. Bush said he thought there would be enough to address all of these promises, but maybe with less money.
"I got elected on the basis of a tax cut," he said, although "all of the numbers I campaigned on may need to change."
The lower surplus projections should be taken as a warning, he said, that perhaps the state's economy is not as strong as some had hoped.
"My feeling is that in times of plenty, we should not overspend," he said. "We should do a few things and do them well. We need to stay focused. This is no time to create a lot of government programs."
The Governor said his inaugural speech next week would not be "a long-winded affair." He will try to use it to set the tone for his second term rather than offer specific proposals. That can wait for his State of the State speech to legislators later this month, he said.
"I think my tone will be just about the same as it was in my first inaugural address: optimistic and upbeat," Mr. Bush said. "What I am looking forward to is remembering this inauguration. The last one went by so fast it was kind of a blur."

HEADLINE: N.F.L. CONFERENCE CHAMPIONSHIPS;
For Bronco Fever, Treatment Is Sunday

BYLINE: By CHARLIE NOBLES 

DATELINE: DENVER, Jan. 12

 BODY:
Todd Tilghman is just starting to get his voice back. The Denver real estate broker says he went overboard last Saturday cheering as the Broncos overwhelmed the Miami Dolphins.
"The day after the game, people thought I was sick," Tilghman said. "They said, 'What's wrong with you?' I said, 'Broncos fever.' I can't wait till Sunday." 
 Terri Reid, a bartender at the Denver Chop House and Brewery, a popular hangout for Broncos players, is also particularly excited about Sunday's American Football Conference championship game between the Broncos and the Jets. Monday night a co-worker whose wife works for the Broncos came through with two tickets to the game.
"I've been a Broncos fan since I was 5 years old, when my father sat me in front of the television and told me about football," Reid said. "I feel so lucky to have gotten tickets."
And well she should. The 2,700 tickets not swallowed up by season ticket-holders disappeared in six minutes on Sunday, according to the Broncos publicist Jim Saccomano.
That means the Broncos will have their 232d straight nonstrike sellout at Mile High Stadium. Two replacement games during the 1987 strike are the only blips on Denver's attendance screen.
Mayor Wellington Webb will be at Mile High. He describes himself as an avid Broncos fan.
"There's probably a dent in the hotel room credenza where the TV happened to be when I was watching that regular-season game against Miami," he said today, referring to Denver's 31-21 defeat in Miami on Dec. 21.
Webb likes to think he is part of a new, winning regime here.
"Last year the Mayor of Green Bay called to remind me that we'd lost two Super Bowls," Webb said. "I told him I wasn't Mayor then."
The Barrel Man will undoubtedly be taking some bows of his own for the Broncos' success. He shows up in the south stands at Mile High, where the rowdies sit, wearing only an orange barrel. He stokes the fans around him with his yells and gestures, a visible symbol of Bronco Mania.
After a pause to reflect on Denver's crush on the team, Webb said: "We're a smaller city, but we have a first-class team and first-class people. We have a lot to be thankful for."
The Jets' presence in this game, compounded by the distinct possibility that this could be John Elway's final home game after 17 seasons as Denver's quarterback, has increased the premium some people are willing to pay for tickets.
"In the 13 years I've been here, this is the biggest I've ever seen it," a ticket broker named Steve, who declined to give his surname, said at Center Stage, a company in Englewood, Colo. "The demand is crazy."
All that demand and all those fans figure to rattle the girders. "There was a consistency to the loudness for the whole game last week," said Steve Antonopulos, the Broncos' trainer for 23 years. "But I think Sunday could be even louder."
Denver embraces all its professional teams, except perhaps the hapless Nuggets in basketball. But the Broncos enjoy a special distinction. Almost everywhere you go, the Broncos are visible. On clothing. On cars. On storefronts.
"The fact we've won one Super Bowl and have the potential of winning another one right away has made this city just electric," said Andrew Hudson, the Mayor's press liaison. "And there's a lot more about the dynamic of the city that lends itself to that. When you talk about how well things are going in the city, from employment to the economy, an overall sense of satisfaction and opportunity, the Broncos just play right into that."
In response to a question, Hudson said he did not know how many transplanted New Yorkers were living here. Nor, he said, did he particularly care. "Five is too many," Hudson said. Then he chuckled softly. "Just kidding."
Webb, voicing the confidence of a defending Super Bowl champion city, said, "The only celebration we'd have is after winning the Super Bowl."
"Anything less," the Mayor said, "would mean we didn't complete our agenda."

HEADLINE: Beware of the Kyoto Compromise

BYLINE: By Jack Kemp and Fred L. Smith Jr.; Jack Kemp is a co-director of Empower America. Fred L. Smith Jr. is president of the Competitive Enterprise Institute.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
In November the Clinton Administration signed a treaty, negotiated in Kyoto, Japan, that purports to temper "global warming" by imposing a schedule of emissions reductions on so-called greenhouse gases. The action was widely regarded as a public relations move, pure and simple, because the Senate has voted overwhelmingly -- 95 to 0 -- to reject the treaty as written.
But if there is no chance of the treaty's protocols going into effect, why are large blocs of corporate America booking seats on the Kyoto Express? The explanation is that they are being seduced by the promise of getting credits for any reductions in emissions they achieve before the Kyoto treaty would take effect in 2008, and in some cases for reductions already achieved. 
 For some companies, the emissions credits earned now could be applied against the strict limits they would face later. And corporations able to make even deeper cuts in emissions now could sell their surplus credits for billions of dollars under a trading system that the Clinton Administration wants to set up. Some large utilities, for example, would benefit, while the petroleum industry would be hurt.
The emissions-credit plan is the brainchild of John Chafee of Rhode Island, the leading Republican environmentalist in the Senate, who worked with Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, a Democrat, and Senator Connie Mack of Florida, a Republican.
These three Senators, honorable men all, seem to believe they have found a "third way" between pro-Kyoto and anti-Kyoto forces.
The stated rationale for their approach is clear enough. Awarding early credits to companies that reduce emissions might encourage a trend toward cutting back on greenhouse gas production. This would win points with the global warming crowd. And the plan also looks attractive to industries, which would find it advantageous to reduce in advance the long-term costs of the Kyoto treaty, or some domestic version of it, and to secure some tangible gain in return.
As usual, though, there is no real third way. Proposals like the one introduced by Senator Chafee and his colleagues will inevitably divide the business community between winners, who can achieve large windfalls, and losers, who will face the full brunt of any emissions controls. The result will be to push the pendulum toward a plan closer to that drawn up in Kyoto.
Unfortunately, this dynamic of giving special breaks to individual companies is all too familiar. It explains why, for example, we have a Federal tax code with rates much higher than they need to be, but with many exemptions, privileges and special rules accorded to favored industries and activities in the form of credits, deductions, exclusions from income and the like.
It represents a cynical bargain between big business and the Federal Government, with the corporations acceding to unreasonably high rates in exchange for special benefits. In 1996, the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform, also known as the Kemp Commission, a private organization created at the request of then Senator Bob Dole and House Speaker Newt Gingrich, found that "the history of our tax code, in economic terms, mirrors the course of most addictions: advancing dependence, diminished returns and deteriorating health of the afflicted."
The Kyoto treaty and its progeny portend a repetition of that experience, only on a global scale. The treaty would create a vast array of bureaucrats, at home and abroad, who would employ vague standards, arbitrary conditions and dubious science to allocate economic rights and privileges.
Bad as the existing tax system is, most of us agree the Government must have some mechanism for raising revenue. But it's not clear at all that we need any regulatory structure for limiting "greenhouse gases," so shaky is the science on which the treaty is based. There is little hard evidence that internationally enforceable emissions limits, implicitly intended to wean us away from use of fossil fuels, will actually slow global warming.
What is more, the Kyoto treaty has not yet devised clear-cut rules governing emissions trading. They are still being negotiated.
The Kyoto treaty is unlikely to be approved by the Senate because control over much of the American economy would be forfeited to international bureaucrats. It would also impose huge new costs on that same economy and cost jobs. This would have the result of transferring wealth from country to country, industry to industry and company to company. The accord's strictures would apply to developed nations but not, conspicuously, to developing nations like China and Paraguay.
Ceding power to unelected global authorities would be a hard sell, even if the science behind Kyoto were compelling. Surrendering power on that scale for the sake of a vague, arbitrary promise of modest financial relief doesn't make sense for any American business.
We must therefore guard against a milder version of the Kyoto treaty that would serve the same purpose, offering concessions to companies that acquiesce in creating the biggest global regulatory regime yet conceived.
Let's not put a more appealing face on a treaty that cannot possibly help our economy and is likely to do it immense harm.

HEADLINE: For New York, 25-Year Losing Streak

SERIES: DROPPING THE BALL: The Decline Of School Sports -- First of three articles.

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
Hipolito Burgos, a 17-year-old senior at Queens Vocational High School, is an immigrant from the Dominican Republic, co-captain of his school's baseball team and an all-round threat as a catcher, outfielder and batter.
And he's a good man with a bilge pump, said his coach, Rob Schimenz. That's an important skill for a ballplayer at Queens Vocational. The team's home field, at a public park about two miles from the school, takes on water like a leaky barge because of a pronounced depression near second base. Shovels, rakes and pumps -- along with bats and balls -- are part of the team's equipment, and making the field playable before games has become part of a captain's job. 
 "This is the hand you're dealt, you try and keep a positive attitude, you try to work with it and the kids," Mr. Schimenz said of his school's sports program, which has no gymnasium, no athletic fields of its own, no money at all for uniforms, and not much more for equipment. Mr. Schimenz even paid for the bilge pump himself. "I don't know what the baseball budget is because I don't have one," he said.
Organizing high school sports in a city like New York -- a crowded concrete landscape -- has never been easy. But for most of this century, the idea of high school sports at least had a firm place in the roster of what public schools were meant to do. Funds were sufficient, if not lavish. Schools like Erasmus Hall in Brooklyn and DeWitt Clinton in the Bronx were nationally recognized powerhouses and vibrant, vital local institutions.
But over the last quarter century, public school sports in the city, and the physical education programs that helped underpin them, have been devalued and cast adrift.
Budgets for sports programs were slashed in the 1970's and were never fully restored; sports facilities, from football fields to basketball gyms, decayed along with many of the rest of the city's school buildings and then always seemed to become the last priority for repair; physical education classes were cut in half in the early 1990's at most schools; demands by the teachers union that coaches be fairly compensated for the many hours they worked led school administrators to control costs by cutting sports. Concerns about legal liability cast a shadow of caution, from the Board of Education down, about physical activity and its inherent risks of injury.
Indeed, interviews with more than 200 current and former coaches, teachers, administrators and students, as well as an examination of 25 years of school system budgets and staffing levels, lay bare what happened: at a time when medicine and sociology were establishing as never before the benefits of physical activity for young people and as obsession with sports was growing across much of the rest of America, the nation's largest public school system all but walked off the field.
Today, despite modest spending increases in the last few years, the city's public high school system offers only a handful of teams for freshmen, provides schools with no money for uniforms, asks varsity football and other coaches to run their programs on budgets of $100, and does not give any school -- from elementary through high school -- a dime for gym equipment. For the 40,000 students who play a sport in a New York high school -- about one in eight -- athletics has become an extra, lumped with all the other categories of experience that would be nice to offer in a perfect world, but that cannot be maintained in this one.
 
A Long Decline
Political Expedience And Parental Apathy
 The 25-year decline and disinvestment in public high school sports happened because politicians either did not pay attention or looked away, as the lesson was absorbed that, because parents and educators rarely objected, there was a minimal political price. The city's 1970's fiscal crisis sapped will and material. Pressure to improve academic performance and reduce overcrowding swallowed resources in the 1980's and 1990's, with other programs such as art and music diminished or erased along with sports. A new policy that allowed students to travel across the city to the high schools of their choosing undermined the concept of the local high school -- and its sports teams -- as the anchors of a neighborhood.
And the apathy of parents matched that of the politicians. Attendance at games and meets, which once helped to pay for sports programs and to reinforce their importance, has all but collapsed. National education experts say that school sports in many major urban centers have struggled to survive, but that in New York both the dimensions and consequences of the decline were magnified by the huge size of the school system, the vast gulfs of wealth and poverty between neighborhoods and the many athletic traditions that were fostered or invented here in years past.
"What we used to consider the standard for school sports is now nostalgic," said Frank J. Macchiarola, who was New York City Schools Chancellor from 1978 to 1983, and who was credited then with trying to rebuild the athletics program. "I don't think the city has the commitment anymore."
It is not easy to precisely measure the consequences of the school system's diminished interest in providing quality sports programs. But educators, coaches, parents and students say the results range from missed opportunities for college athletic scholarships to poorer general health of students to the loss of an educational tool for teaching self-esteem and teamwork to the erosion of what many once saw as a bridge that could connect young people divided by race and income and culture.
"I think that in many cases that road was very shortsighted," said Rudy Crew, who took over as the New York City Schools Chancellor in late 1995 and who has restored some financing to the sports programs since then. Dr. Crew said he believed the damage from the years of budget cuts and the resulting decline in facilities and commitment was largely invisible, and irreparable, measured in the lives of students who passed through the system untouched by the benefits that athletic activity can bring. "We lost a lot of kids," he said.
The picture of public high school sports is grim when compared to much of the rest of the nation:
*In the 1990's, as enrollment in the school system surged, spending on extracurricular sports in New York City high schools fell by more than 19 percent, according to the New York State Department of Education, from $10.8 million in 1989-90, in inflation-adjusted dollars, to $8.7 million last year. New York spent more for interscholastic high school sports in the 1974-75 school year, when the city was on the brink of bankruptcy -- about $9.1 million -- than it did last year at the height of an economic boom, the state said.
*The city spends less per pupil on extracurricular athletics than other major cities in New York or around the nation. The amount provided to schools for sports materials, equipment and supplies has also fallen sharply -- down more than 29 percent since 1974, according to state figures -- compounded by a dramatic increase in the number of high schools and new teams, especially for girls. School teams now get an average of about $100 for a whole school year -- or about the price of a single new football helmet. And unlike their counterparts in many large cities in the nation, or in New York's suburbs, teams get nothing at all for uniforms or transportation.
*The percentage of New York high school students participating in a sport is now at the very bottom among the nation's largest cities, according to a 1997 survey by the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. Of the 15 cities surveyed, New York was tied with Miami for the lowest rate of sports participation.
*Physical education efforts have been decimated. System wide there were fewer than two gym teachers for every 1000 students in kindergarten through 12th grade in New York City last year, according to analysis by The New York Times, using state data. That is less than half as many gym teachers, measured against enrollment, as schools have in Westchester, Nassau or Suffolk counties or across the rest of the state.
*Many students are overweight and inactive. More than half of the 1,500 New York City public high school students randomly tested in the 1990's in a study by Queens College already had one major risk factor for heart disease, mainly excess weight and lack of physical activity. Almost half of the girls and one in five of the boys were overweight to a level considered medically obese, the study said. Figures from the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also suggest that obesity rates among teen-agers may be higher in New York. Nationally, only about one in eight of the teen-agers tested by the Centers in the most recent period, from 1988 to 1994, were overweight.
 
The Cheering Stopped
From a Model System To a Cautionary Tale
 New York, to a great degree, helped invent many of the 20th century forms of public school sports, historians say, through the Public Schools Athletic League, created in 1903. The P.S.A.L., as it is known -- an arm of the Board of Education charged with scheduling, monitoring and assigning funds for interscholastic sports -- was copied by cities all over the country early in the century. By the 1920's, P.S.A.L. track and field events were held that attracted tens of thousands of boys and girls from elementary school age on up to compete for medals in exercises such as situps and pullups.
Public school sports got more money and resources then, but also more attention and respect. In the 1950's and early 1960's, generally considered the heyday of New York City high school sports -- at least for boys, since girls' sports barely existed in those years -- football rivalries like Samuel J. Tilden against Thomas Jefferson were often played out in front of 15,000 fans or more at Ebbets Field. Players for major sports schools like Bayside in Queens, or Abraham Lincoln in Brooklyn, got hero treatment: warm-up parkas, trophies, championship rings. Just about every school had a pep band and a parents booster club that could mobilize resources when the city's contribution fell short.
"There was a lot of community spirit, a lot of school spirit that you don't see now -- it all held together," said Moe Finkelstein, the football coach at Thomas Jefferson from 1955 until his retirement in 1987. "And all the schools were loaded with clubs and activities besides sports. There were lectures, clubs -- you never wanted to leave."
To be sure, school administrators have faced wrenching choices in distributing their resources. But sports, even if they were never formally disavowed by any administrator or mayor, almost always lost out to something deemed more important. At the same time, whether to have sports at all -- or what emphasis to give them -- has become a matter of debate. Many teachers and coaches say, for example, that they believe that professional sports no longer send positive images to young people, who see only the money and ego and greed, and that tales about high schools and colleges where sports have become perhaps too important -- to the detriment of students -- have made athletics harder to defend.
But many others say that the deterioration and disappearance of the city's public high school sports -- and a diminished emphasis on physical activity in general -- flew in the face of a growing body of evidence about their positive impact on young people. That evidence indicated that athletic participation could be a crucial element in keeping students in school and improving academic performance. There are educators who have held onto sports, and schools where meaningful athletics programs exist in the city, but they are rare and scattered. The odds were against them.
The first body blow to school sports came in the mid-1960's, when the school system's teachers began protesting that the old loosely structured work rules about after-school duties -- for athletics as well as arts and clubs -- were exploiting their good will. Successive contracts with the union that included formalized rules about pay and seniority then followed, pushing costs up and resulting in decisions to scale back sports, among other things. At the same time, fear of violence at school sports events encouraged school officials to play down the importance of interschool contests.
 The 1970's then brought outright financial setbacks for sports programs that had already been weakened. In 1975 alone, the P.S.A.L. program, which administered virtually all sports, was cut by nearly 41 percent. More important, the cuts also marked the beginning of a pattern: silent acquiescence. Sports slid away more or less quietly.
"You keep doing it, it gets easier -- it becomes part of the protocol," said Edward I. Koch, the city's Mayor from 1978 to 1989. "Like any budget, you have to make a decision as to what's important, and if you decide, as many did, that, 'most important,' didn't cover sports and cultural subjects, then that's what got cut."
In the 1980's and 1990's, the athletic program came under stress from internal forces in the education system itself as the system sharply grew and changed. Federal law mandated equal treatment for girls' sports, but without more spending by the city, that simply meant a further stretching of limited resources.
The number of high schools offering sports also grew from 107 to 165 as the city began experimenting with smaller, specialized schools. Such schools, unlike traditional high schools, draw students from all over the city, and many school officials and parents say that has muted one of the traditional pressure points of local school politics: organized, vocal parents who live in defined geographic areas, and to whom a single City Council member or community board representative had to answer. About one in five of the city's 312,000 high school students now attends one of these specialty academies.
Physical education requirements for high school students, meanwhile, fell. New York City for many years -- by tradition if not requirement -- gave high school students gym five days a week, a level that was twice the minimum state requirement. But in the early 1990's, that tradition died as most schools went to the lower standard of two days one week, three days in the next. Coming at a time of other budget cuts, that furthered the downward spiral for athletics, teachers say, by making many students physically unfit to play sports, or predisposed toward not wanting to. But more crucial for the system, administrators say, it sharply reduced lobbying pressure for physical education from the United Federation of Teachers, because that part of the union's membership declined.
Internal changes at the Board of Education -- mainly a result of cost cutting and streamlining -- also altered the political balance. In the early 1990's, for example, the Bureau of Physical Education, which had been part of the Division of Curriculum and Instruction, was dismantled. An agency with a vested self-interest in defending gym at budget time was silenced.
"There was no longer a single point of advocacy for that area of the New York City school system," said the former head of the city's high schools division from 1991 until 1997, John J. Ferrandino.
Meanwhile, the support of parents -- considered by most coaches to be the most important element of a program's success -- withered. Schools that could once draw thousands or hundreds of fans -- buying tickets that helped pay expenses -- saw the numbers fall into the hundreds, even dozens.
"The parents don't support children the way they did years ago, the city doesn't support them, some of the heads of the school don't support them," said Ann Davis, who was one of about two dozen people in the stands to watch Thomas Jefferson High School's football team play its first home game in early September. Ms. Davis and her husband, Ray, still come even though their son, Rashan, graduated last year. "Do you see a principal here, a dean?" Ms. Davis said. "They're not even here to support the team. And that is sad, that is sad."

Rock-Hard Neglect
So Few Fields, So Many Dreams
 Even getting former New York City politicians to remember what happened to sports is hard. David N. Dinkins, the Mayor from 1990 to 1993, said that he had always been a supporter of school athletics, but that without a search of his administration's archives, he could not recall or comment on what his record had been.
Mr. Koch confessed that he didn't know what the Public Schools Athletic League even was. "What is the P.S.A.L? Are they private sector?" Mr. Koch said.
Money was not the only thing to dry up. Where there was less money, there was also less attention, less energy and less emphasis on getting things done or making them better, school officials say. Where getting by is the rule, school officials say that improvement or repair to sports facilities has become almost impossible.
Brooklyn Technical High School, for example, has been playing on a vacant industrial lot near Fort Greene Park for more than 15 years. The city spent about $250,000 in the mid-1980's on engineering studies, but the $3.2 million plan to convert the rock-strewn lot into a real ball field foundered during the recession at the decade's close.
"I've got a field outside that's totally useless -- a soccer field, it's all dirt -- but there's no plan or no method for me to say, 'Look guys, I need you to upgrade my field here,' " said Bill Belfi, the chairman of the physical education department at Benjamin N. Cardozo High School in Bayside, Queens. "You get on a list and you wait 10, 15 years -- then it's still maybe."
Top school system administrators say they now believe that the worst of the imbalances against athletics are over. Financing has increased in the last several years, particularly in middle school athletics and for high school junior varsity teams, both of which had been completely eliminated.
New private alternatives have also emerged, like the Ivy League, which organizes girls' softball in Washington Heights and is financed by private donations. And there have always been other ways children in the city have found a way to play sports -- at Y.M.C.A.'s or in church leagues.
Some school coaches have even turned the city's neglect of athletics into a motivational tool. Athletes in New York, they say, have to be tougher and more dedicated to put up with what the city throws at them: crumbling facilities, apathy, incompetence.
Places like the Rock, as South Shore High School's rubble-strewn football field has been dubbed, or the Iron Cage, that the basketball team from East Side Community High School sometimes practices in -- the ceiling so low that you can't take a jump shot without banking it off the ceiling -- are held out by players and coaches like badges of honor. "It makes us mad, so we're tougher," said Alex Figueroa, a 17-year-old co-captain and quarterback of the Brooklyn Technical High School football team as he showed off the scars that snaked up his forearms from playing for four years on the school's rocky field.

Separate, and Unequal
Can't Afford It, Just Drop It
 At Stuyvesant High School, a gleaming new showplace of the city's education system in lower Manhattan, the athletic program spends $2,000 a week during the football season for a bus to carry the team and its equipment three miles across town to its practice field.
At Bronx Regional High School in the South Bronx, the assistant principal, Wade Williams, was reduced, literally, to passing around a hat to raise enough money to get his girls' volleyball team home from a rough neighborhood in Brooklyn last year.
Williams did what he said he had to do at least once a year: He went to the faculty and told them the athletics department had gone broke again.
"The girls have to walk through the projects to get to the train station, and God forbid something happens to these young ladies," Mr. Williams said, recounting his story to the teachers. " 'You've got to help me out here,' I said, then I took off my hat."
The fact is, both schools live by the kindness of strangers and friends. The city provides no money for Stuyvesant's buses or for Bronx Regional's carfares -- school sports teams in New York get no money for uniforms, no money for transportation and little money for equipment. The city pays salary stipends for coaches and athletic directors and for officials at games and meets, leaving just about everything else to the discretion, and fund-raising ability, of the schools. Stuyvesant, with an illustrious alumni list and a solid middle-class base of students, simply has better sources to beg from than can be found in the South Bronx.
The city's contribution to the schools is equal per team, but since that contribution leaves school officials with the need to make up 80 percent or more of a sports program themselves, it has separated the city into socioeconomic haves and have-nots, and created what school sports experts say is, in effect, a pay-for-play sports system.
"The P.S.A.L. will tell you if you can't fund it, drop it," said Nick Ragusa, the athletic director at Chelsea High School in Manhattan.
The unevenness of the system has also highlighted the differences between the city's schools and the large system of private and parochial schools, many of which have thrived by cultivating their images as places where sports in New York still work the way they used to.
"It becomes a social and political issue," said David S. Liebschutz, the associate director of the Center for the Study of the States at the Rockefeller Institute of Government. "If you don't have the wherewithal to get access to stuff, as people do in the suburbs, where do you go?"
Sometimes it simply means children are left out. Claude Robinson, the athletic director at Thomas Jefferson High School in Brooklyn, had two great baseball players in the building last year, but they didn't play because neither one of them had money for cleats. Robinson said he wanted to pay for the cleats himself, but couldn't.
"If you give to one, you have to give to all," he said. "And there wasn't money for that."
When it comes to physical education, school regulations require that every child below high school age get at least three days a week of gym. The reality is more like Public School 310 in the Bronx, where Sonia Menendez, the principal, struggles to give her nearly 1,100 students even one gym class a week.
Ms. Menendez lost about half of her playground in the 1980's to a temporary classroom annex. The school has a small gym, and half again as many students as it was designed for.
"We're making do, that's what's happening," she said.
There are no reliable statistics about gym because many teachers and principals say it has become a lie. Things can be called gym to satisfy the paper requirements. Overcrowded schools like 310, including many in Queens and the Bronx, cannot meet the requirements because of limited space. In other schools, there is just not enough money to make it work.
"When I came here, we had five gym teachers," said Hank Whitney, who has been the principal of Intermediate School 49 in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn since 1977. "Now I have three. I had to sacrifice gym because I don't have the personnel."
That gap, between what is required and what is possible, has left administrators and coaches all grappling to make do -- some in corrosive cynicism about the system's hypocrisy, some in idealism as they try to make their resources stretch. School administrators say that since they never see any school reprimanded for not providing enough physical activity, the inevitable message is that it doesn't really matter.
"Physical education is dying in New York City," said Hector Martinez, the athletic director at West Side High in midtown Manhattan, as he showed a reporter the school's gym, essentially a classroom with weight-lifting machines. Mr. Martinez admitted that he had to cheat a little, by borrowing money from the school's health department budget, to get even this secondhand equipment. "That's what you have to do," he said.
Some school officials also said that formal structured gym had in fact been tacitly discouraged in a system where lawsuits and liability are a constant concern. They say that less formal gym instruction means less exposure to lawsuits from possible injuries.
"I know that schools are not in compliance, and nothing is being done -- I have not heard of one school being written up," said Maria Rodriguez, the director of East Harlem Technical Junior High School, which reinstituted physical education classes several years ago after about a decade without organized gym.
Many students say that gym has become something to be ignored.
"A lot of times, you just sit there in your sweats or your T-shirt for 45 minutes on the floor or against the wall or whatever, the teachers take attendance, and that would be it," said Kerly Suffren, a 17-year-old junior at Martin Luther King High School in Manhattan. "Then the bell rings, and you change and go back to your regular class -- so a lot of kids feel that it's not necessary or that it's irrelevant."
Ed Beller, West Side High School's basketball coach and an English teacher, said he thought that for all the talk about broader educational horizons, New York has actually narrowed its vision -- so much so that everything beyond academic performance has become almost invisible. As he talked, he watched his basketball team thread down Eighth Avenue in the garment district, weaving around men with their beers in paper bags and the racks of suits being trundled through the crosswalks. His team, lacking a gym, was in search of a park to practice in.
"There was a period of time when the whole child, the whole development -- all that stuff had currency, had some, I don't know what the word is, validity in the minds of the Board of Education," he said. "Now it seems to have no validity with them at all."

HEADLINE: Pataki Inaugural Team Told to Disclose Costs

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 12

 BODY:
A ruling today by the state's highest court forces Gov. George E. Pataki's supporters to disclose detailed expenses paid by his 1995 inaugural and transition organizations, information they have fought for four years to keep secret.
The decision, by the Court of Appeals, is the latest in a long string of court losses for associates of the Governor, who have opposed a bid by the majority Democrats in the State Assembly to learn how the two organizations raised and spent more than $2.5 million. 
 The Court of Appeals refused to hear the Pataki team's appeal, meaning that orders by two lower courts to turn over the information stand. With no higher state court to appeal to, the transition and inaugural organizations have 15 days to provide the information to the Assembly Democrats.
Today's decision deals specifically with $60,000 in credit card charges. The two groups had given only a general description of the charges and had not said who made each one. The Assembly Democrats won the right today to see the credit card receipts.
The Democrats said today they had no idea what they would find in the data. "What we've been trying to do for four years now is just plain public disclosure, and this is a big step in that direction," said Patricia Lynch, a spokeswoman for the Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat.
The ruling also gives the Democrats the right to take sworn testimony from Charles A. Gargano, who was Mr. Pataki's chief fund-raiser in 1994 and headed the inaugural team. He is now the State Commissioner of Economic Development. Ms. Lynch said it was not clear whether the Assembly would call Mr. Gargano to testify.
Michael McKeon, the Governor's press secretary, said of today's ruling: "This has been a politically motivated case from the very beginning, and it still is today. Nevertheless, we will comply."
In late 1994, after Mr. Pataki defeated Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, the Governor-elect's aides and supporters formed a corporation to pay for his lavish, three-day inaugural festivities, which cost $1.6 million, and another to finance a transition team, which spent $900,000.
Aides to Mr. Pataki said the organizations would make full disclosure of their finances and would abide by the rules governing campaign fund-raising, although there was no legal requirement that they do so. But after he took office, the two corporations declined to make their records public, and it was disclosed that some corporate sponsors gave far more than the $5,000 limit on corporate campaign contributions.
Not until July 1996 did the organizations, under court order, release the names of contributors and the amounts they gave, which showed that the total raised was much higher than administration officials had said.
Most of the money came from corporations and business people whose interests were regulated by the state or who were seeking state contracts, and the records showed that many corporate sponsors had given far more than the $5,000 limit on corporate campaign contributions.
It was also disclosed that many of the Governor's advisers collected salaries from the transition fund, including some who failed to disclose the income on the forms they filed with the State Ethics Commission, as required by law.
Later court rulings forced the release of most information on how the money was spent.

HEADLINE: Whitman Sets April 15 For Property Tax Plan

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 12

 BODY:
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman asked state lawmakers today to enact her proposed five-year, $1 billion property tax relief package by April 15 so homeowners can get their first rebate check by Labor Day.
Republican and Democratic lawmakers applauded the plan, which Governor Whitman outlined today in her fifth annual address to a joint session of the State Legislature. The proposal would provide an average rebate check of $120 to homeowners this year and an average of $600 annually beginning in the fifth year. Tenants would receive an average of $100 annually under the program when it is fully phased in. 
 But Mrs. Whitman acknowledged that using state budget dollars to pay for property tax rebates in future years would require "fiscal discipline from those of us in Trenton."
"Fiscal discipline means being very cautious about any new spending programs," she said. "Fiscal discipline means constantly reminding ourselves that the No. 1 priority is helping you, the taxpayer. The fiscal discipline we show today will deliver a check to you tomorrow."
Most of the other new initiatives that Governor Whitman presented today as her top legislative priorities for the coming year focused on education, health care and open space, as well as an issue that is a concern of a growing number of middle-class families: caring for chronically ill elderly relatives.
Although the state is expected to end the current fiscal year with a budget surplus between $800 million and $1 billion, most of the Governor's plans would require modest or no spending increases or would be paid for from existing funds or windfalls, like the tobacco settlement.
In her 35-minute address at the recently renovated War Memorial building here, Mrs. Whitman called for imposing tougher standards on new teachers, offering cash incentives to landowners who donate open space or farmland to the state or private land trusts, hiring more park maintenance workers, and expanding the program providing health insurance to uninsured children.
For the state's elderly residents and those who care for them, Mrs. Whitman proposed a $60 million spending increase over the next three years, using state and Federal funds for a program that would seek to help elderly people remain in their homes by providing easier access to long-term home care services. The plan would also offer financial assistance, training programs and counseling to caregivers.
State health officials said that the Governor's plan to assist those families caring for disabled and chronically ill relatives would be in addition to Federal financing that President Clinton proposed earlier this month. Mr. Clinton included the new dollars for states when he proposed a $1,000 tax credit for people who need long-term care.
Although Governor Whitman defeated former Gov. Jim Florio with the enthusiastic support of the National Rifle Association, she disappointed some gun owners and the gun lobby today. She announced that she would propose legislation requiring that every gun sold in New Jersey include either a safety lock or the new "smart gun" technology, preventing anyone other than the gun's owner from firing the weapon.
"Those school shootings last week and last year happened in other states," Mrs. Whitman said. "Next time, it could be our state, our kids, our tragedy. I don't want one more gun sold in this state without built-in protection for our children."
But Mrs. Whitman is likely to face a battle from some lawmakers over the gun legislation, particularly from Assembly Speaker Jack Collins, a fellow Republican. He was among a handful of lawmakers who did not applaud when she talked about the gun bill. He said later that he would be reluctant to impose requirements on gun owners before the "smart gun" technology was widely available.
Mr. Collins said that Mrs. Whitman's speech addressed the top concerns of New Jerseyans, and he added that he believed lawmakers would enact Mrs. Whitman's property tax plan by the April 15 deadline that she set today. He also said that he supported most of the Governor's other legislative initiatives, but that he would reject her recommendation imposing tougher standards for new teachers.
Graduates from New Jersey colleges must now carry a C plus average to qualify as a candidate for teacher certification in the state. Mrs. Whitman said today in her speech that "C plus is not good enough" and that she wants the State Board of Education to require all new graduates who apply for certification to carry at least a B average.
Mr. Collins, a lawyer and college professor, disagreed with Mrs. Whitman's approach, noting that he had had a "little less" than a C plus average and was a "damn good teacher."
Although most Democratic lawmakers are expected to go along with the property tax rebate plan, some expressed concern about the long-term fiscal implications. Others questioned the fairness of making the rebates available even to the state's wealthiest residents.
Several Democrats took credit today for Governor Whitman's decision to make property tax relief the centerpiece of her address. Five years ago, Mrs. Whitman cut state income tax rates by 30 percent, but polls showed that voters did not give her much credit for the tax cuts during her hard-fought 1997 re-election campaign. Mrs. Whitman won re-election, but narrowly, in part because voters complained that she did not do enough to bring down the state's property tax rates, the highest in the nation. They also complained about auto insurance, which Mrs. Whitman addressed last year but did not mention today.
"Welcome to the Democratic neighborhood of fighting for property tax relief," said State Senator Richard J. Codey, the Democratic leader in the Senate. "This surplus from the economic boom belongs to the people, so it is only right to give it back to them. Democrats will fight to make sure the Republicans don't get weak knees about property tax relief when the times get tough."

Brazil Stocks Fall Steeply Amid Currency and Capital Fears

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Brazilian stocks plunged yesterday as rumors about devaluation and concern about capital flight undermined efforts by the Government to calm investors.
It was the fourth day in a row that the stock market fell, a selloff set in motion by the decision of one of Brazil's biggest states not to make its debt payments to the central Government for 90 days. 
 Other Latin American stocks markets fell, too, and emerging-market bonds declined. In Sao Paulo, the benchmark Bovespa stock index fell 7.6 percent and is off 19 percent since last Wednesday. In Mexico City, the Bolsa index dropped 3.7 percent and in dollar terms has lost 15 percent since the start of 1999. Argentina's Merval index fell 3.5 percent.
Investors are again facing the worries of last fall: Will Brazil fail in its efforts to reduce spending and the budget deficit and be forced to devalue its currency, the real? And if that happens, how bad would the fallout be elsewhere in the world, especially the United States?
Brazil received a $41.5 billion rescue package a few months ago, backed by the International Monetary Fund and the United States. Tensions were also eased by interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve and European central banks.
But with the refusal of the state of Minas Gerais to make debt payments for 90 days, doubts have intensified about the ability of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso to achieve Brazil's spending and deficit goals. "Things in the market are not good," said Desmond Lachman, director of emerging markets economic research at Salomon Smith Barney. "If they don't turn things around quickly it will be hard to restore investor confidence."
Arturo C. Porzecanski, chief economist for the Americas at ING Barings, said the Government had not been able to regain the initiative since the state debt moratorium was announced.
One sign of investor fear is the pace of money leaving the country. On Monday, according to the Government, $200 million flowed out. But yesterday, traders were reporting that as much as $1 billion might have left the country. "They are losing reserves at a faster pace than before," Mr. Lachman said, referring to the dollars the Government can use to defend the nation's currency by buying it.
Another problem is a series of rumors, which seemed to intensify with a drop in the value of the Brazilian currency yesterday, that the Government would devalue.
As the stock market was plunging, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin gave President Cardoso a vote of confidence. After a meeting in Washington with the Argentine President, Carlos Saul Menem, Mr. Rubin said: "I start from the view that the Brazilian program should work. It was a good program that was announced. President Cardoso is deeply committed to getting this done. The politics obviously are the key. There are a lot of reasons to be hopeful."
At the same time, a group of 17 governors from other Brazilian states met and said that while they would like to renegotiate their debt obligations with the central Government, they did not support the moratorium on payments by Minas Gerais. However, other states may still choose to join Minas Gerais.
Another calming effort was made by the World Bank country director for Brazil. In an interview with Bloomberg News, Gobind Nankani said, "Hopefully, markets will begin to look again at the behavior of the executive, the behavior of the Congress, the behavior of other governors and not overreact to the Minas state" situation.

Intel Reports Solid Earnings In Its Fourth Quarter
Buoyed by strong sales of its high-end microprocessors and increased operating efficiencies, Intel reported fourth-quarter financial results that substantially exceeded Wall Street analysts' estimates. But Intel advised analysts that sales for the first quarter of 1999 are likely to fall, following a normal seasonal pattern. 
 For the fourth quarter, Intel reported earnings of $2.1 billion, or $1.19 a share, up 18 percent from $1.7 billion, or 98 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Revenue rose 17 percent, to $7.6 billion, from $6.5 billion. Analysts expected Intel to earn $1.07 a share. Page C4.
 
Seagate Technology, the No. 1 independent maker of computer disk drives, posted net income for its fiscal second quarter that beat expectations as the company benefited from a surge in sales of personal computers. C4.
 
Suit Against Coltec Dismissed
A Federal Judge dismissed a lawsuit by the Crane Company seeking to block Coltec Industries from merging with B.F. Goodrich in a deal that gives Coltec shareholders substantially less than Crane had offered to pay. The ruling by United States District Judge Barbara S. Jones in White Plains allows Coltec and Goodrich to proceed with their deal. It is unclear whether Crane will appeal. C6.
 
Marketers Ponder Life Without Mike
With the second and apparently final retirement of Michael Jordan from basketball, which is expected to be announced today, will Madison Avenue lose the most prolific, most richly compensated and perhaps most effective endorser ever? Or can Mr. Jordan continue to be a world champion pitchman in retirement? Stuart Elliott: Advertising. C6.
 
Fewer Choices for Health Insurance
The health insurance industry is rapidly whittling itself down to a few giant companies that dominate the health systems of some of the country's biggest cities. Doctors and hospitals are increasingly concerned, and the trend is also raising questions about the cost and availability of care to millions of patients and their employers. A1.
 
Testimony Backs Microsoft Position
An economist testifying for the Government conceded that there was scant evidence consumers had been harmed by practices that are central to the Justice Department's antitrust case against Microsoft. C5.
 
U.S. Markets Off Sharply
Stocks moved sharply lower in heavy trading as traders and investors took profits on issues that have shot higher since the start of the year. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 145.21 points, or 1.5 percent, to 9,474.68. The Nasdaq composite index fell 63.84 points, or 2.7 percent, to 2,320.75. C7.

Pricing Internet Stocks
The recent surge in share prices for Internet companies like Yahoo has analysts wondering whether financial performance is irrelevant for many of the investors jumping in.

U.N. Says Iraq Withholds Aid From Its Children
Evidence is growing that President Saddam Hussein of Iraq has put off buying or distributing vital food and medicine that he can import through limited oil sales, diplomats and United Nations officials said. The evidence comes at a time when pressure is mounting to lift economic sanctions on Iraq, to improve the lives of its people. Officials say that childhood nutrition is of particular concern. A6
 
The Pentagon vowed to continue a low-level war of attrition with Iraqi air defenses even though a series of American strikes has done little to dampen Saddam Hussein's defiance of the no-flight zones. In the latest skirmish, an American F-16 fighter jet fired on a radar site in northern Iraq. A6 

Sanctions Over Aid to Iran
The Clinton Administration announced economic penalties against three Russian institutions that it contends are helping Iran and possibly other nations develop nuclear weapons and missiles. The sanctions mean that all American exports to the institutions, and all imports from them, are banned. A7
 
In Kosovo, a Promise to Free 8
Ethnic Albanian rebels have agreed to release the eight Yugoslav soldiers they have been holding since a convoy strayed into rebel-held territory in Kosovo four days ago. A4
 
Congo Allies Bomb Rebels
Allies of the Congo Government bombed the third-largest city in that country, killing 17 people, a rebel leader said. The Missionary Service News Agency, based in Rome, also reported the bombing of Kisangani and put the death toll at 40. A3
 
Castro Case Moved to Miami
A Federal judge in Puerto Rico, in what could prove a pivotal ruling in the case of seven Cuban exiles accused of plotting to kill Fidel Castro in 1997, granted a defense petition to transfer the trial to Miami, despite opposition from the United States Attorney's Office. Trying the case in Miami, which is heavily populated by Cuban-Americans who oppose Mr. Castro, is expected to make it easier for defense lawyers to get a sympathetic jury. A5
 
Snag in Mexican Death Inquiry
The investigation into the apparent killing of Philip True, an American journalist who died last month during a 10-day hike through remote mountains, has become mired in conflicting autopsy reports and contradictory confessions by two men charged with the killing. A8
 
New Push for Gay Ambassador
President Clinton has defied senior Republican lawmakers by renominating a prominent San Francisco philanthropist, James C. Hormel, left, as Ambassador to Luxembourg, a post in which he would be the first openly gay American ambassador, White House and Congressional officials said. A8

Supreme Court Overturns Limits on Ballot Initiatives
The Supreme Court rebuffed Colorado's effort to regulate the process of getting initiatives on the ballot, in a decision extolling the First Amendment value of uninhibited "communication with voters." The decision has possible implications for the Court's approach to political speech, the doctrine at the heart of the debate over campaign finance reform. A1
 
The lawyer for a Georgia school board warned the Court that school districts across the country would face dire financial consequences if Federal sexual harassment law is applied to harassment of one student by another and schools are made liable for failing to curb students' sexual misconduct. A16
 
River Cleanup Is Sought
Two environmental groups said that one area of the Woonasquatucket River in North Providence, R.I., was so polluted that they would file legal petitions to Federal authorities calling for an emergency investigation and cleanup of the area. Upstream from Providence, the groups say, testing has turned up the second-highest level of the poison dioxin ever found in river sediment -- surpassed only in the Passaic River in New Jersey near the factory that produced Agent Orange. A10
 
Tax Credits for the Disabled
President Clinton will propose a new tax credit and health insurance coverage today to help people with disabilities go back to work, White House officials said. Senior members of Congress from both parties immediately endorsed major elements of the proposal. A12
 
A Full Agenda for Senate
Fearing a public backlash, Senate Republicans insisted that they could pursue an ambitious legislative agenda while conducting an impeachment trial of President Clinton. "When this impeachment process is done," said Senator Larry Craig of Idaho, "we will be able to tell all of you that the people's business was advanced." A14
 
Mr. Clinton sent $850,000 to Paula Corbin Jones to settle the sexual misconduct lawsuit. A14

Federal Government Joins Lawsuit by Oneida Indians
The Federal Government has joined the Oneida Indians in a lawsuit that contends that state and local governments unlawfully acquired 270,000 acres of land in central New York from the Indians nearly 200 years ago. Lawyers for the Justice Department and the Oneidas have provoked widespread anxiety by seeking to expand the suit to name not just the state, but also some 20,000 property owners as defendants. A1
 
End Seen to Lockout by ABC
ABC's 10-week-old lockout of 2,200 workers appeared near an end, as union leaders said they would agree to the network's no-strike provision in order to return to work, and would likely move by week's end to send the company's latest contract offer to employees for a vote. B1
 
Gay Health Group in Crisis
When the Gay Men's Health Crisis announced last month that it would no longer hold a popular annual AIDS fund-raising event on Fire Island, the move did more than end a public relations nightmare. It highlighted a more serious fund-raising problem that has forced the group to eliminate more than a quarter of its staff positions. B1

HEADLINE: Tax Relief Proposal Attracts Criticism and Praise

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: ROXBURY, N.J., Jan. 12

 BODY:
Try as he may to muster enthusiasm for Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's proposed property tax rebates for homeowners, Donald Dyrness kept sliding into cynicism today, because he has also heard from his local school board that the district stands to lose $2.4 million in state aid this year.
"It's a charade," said Mr. Dyrness, 34, the president of a family-owned custom-building company, as he did the math. 
 Mr. Dyrness, who supported Mrs. Whitman, a fellow Republican, in the last two elections, said: "The rebate will mean from $120 to $200 a home for us, but the loss of the aid will mean a $440-a-home increase. She's giving with one hand and taking away with the other, and I think she just wants to be able to say that she cut taxes again."
While others around the state were critical of the plan today, some local officials enthusiastically greeted the Governor's five-year, $1 billion rebate plan. Still others modulated their reaction, saying that they welcomed the tax relief but that it fell far short of the structural reforms needed to ease the heavy burden of financing schools and services.
Bill Dressel, executive director of the New Jersey League of Municipalities, was one of those who moderated his enthusiasm. While the rebates represented the Governor's commitment in flush times to some sort of relief, he said, a permanent constitutional change is needed to reduce the reliance on property taxes.
"We are not home free yet, and I'm not ready to say that this will meet our concerns completely," he said. "But it is an infusion of money, and the bigger hurdle of convincing the administration and the Legislature that we need alternatives to the property tax is still there."
But among other officials, the praise was unrestrained. They said they were also grateful for Mrs. Whitman's announcement today that she supported indexing state aid to inflation and eliminating state income taxes for those earning less than $13,000 a year.
"As an urban Republican, I am excited about this with all of the different pieces," said Martin G. Barnes, the Mayor of Paterson. "All together, it is something that helps everyone and not just the suburban areas, and if one of these pieces disappears, there will be a perception problem with it all."
While Mayor Carl W. Block of Stafford Township in Ocean County lamented that the Governor's proposal did little to alter dependence on property taxes, he praised her for responding to the clamor from school and municipal officials to ease the local tax burden.
In Elizabeth, Mayor Chris Bollwage, a Democrat, theorized that the Governor's tax proposals were political moves intended to keep the Legislature in Republican hands in this year's elections. "But it was also the right thing to do, and so the motive isn't that important," he said.
Most of the local elected officials said it was politically difficult to oppose any kind of tax relief, however flawed. They said they would have preferred the state to grant the relief directly to them so that they could pass on the savings to local taxpayers, but some conceded that the Governor was right to be concerned that would not happen.
In Roxbury -- where 83.9 percent of the residents own their homes -- the average home costs $185,000 and the average property tax mirrors the state average of $4,000 a year. Mrs. Whitman is popular in Roxbury, where she won by more than a two-to-one vote in 1997. But there also is great sensitivity among the estimated 27,000 residents about the ballooning growth in school spending.
Donald Dyrness's father, Dan, who moved to Roxbury as a child in the 1950's, when the township was mostly farmland, said the rapid increase in local taxes was creating fear that his son and other younger people would not be able to afford to stay in the area. For the elder Mr. Dyrness, who like his son is both a Republican and a Whitman supporter, the rebate is an attempt at "a quick fix."
The Rev. Sue Ellis Melrose, pastor of the First Presbyterian Church in Succasunna and a Roxbury school board member, said school enrollment was growing so rapidly in the district that the board faced a shortfall of six classrooms for next fall.
Recalculations of the education aid formula two years ago had hurt the district, but stopgap aid last year eased the problem. But now the district again faces the problem, with a possible $2.4 million loss in state aid from its $41 million budget, she said.
Ms. Melrose, a Democrat, said she would not send her rebate check back to the state, but she added: "It will be enough to take us out to dinner, maybe twice, and that's it. What we really need here is something to stabilize state aid and deliver us from the Catch 22 of providing a quality education while reducing spending."
Richard Zoschak, a Republican who owns a photography business in Roxbury and is a Planning Board member, echoed those concerns, noting that the elderly residents of the town were being hit particularly hard by the increasing local tax burden and would be helped little by the small rebates being proposed.
Donald Dyrness recalled that past state rebate programs involved complex calculations and a costly bureaucracy. His common sense told him, he said, that direct grants to school districts would cost less to administer but would have less direct political benefit for the Governor.
"I think she wants to be Senator, President or Vice President," he said. "But I'm not too impressed."

HEADLINE: The Japanese Intervene To Drive Down A Surging Yen

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The Japanese central bank intervened in the currency markets yesterday, selling yen for dollars and sending the currency down 3 percent, its biggest one-day loss in more than three years.
The intervention was an acknowledgment by Japan that the rising value of the yen, up 31 percent since August, is making its faltering effort to turn the economy around even more difficult. A strong yen is damaging because it makes Japanese exports, a possible engine of recovery, much more expensive, and therefore, less competitive abroad. 
 But whether the intervention is going to stop the yen's rise and the dollar's decline is unclear. Many traders think that the yen will have to rally a little further -- and the dollar slip lower -- before there is a turnaround. That means the Bank of Japan, the nation's central bank, will probably have to intervene again. Whether the United States will join in, as it did this past June, is open to debate.
Asked about the Japanese currency intervention after a meeting with President Carlos Saul Menem of Argentina, Secretary of the Treasury Robert E. Rubin would not comment directly. But he did say, "I'll just repeat what I've said so often, which is a strong dollar has served us well and our dollar policy is absolutely unchanged."
Avinash Persaud, global head of currency research at J. P Morgan Securities in London, said that two forces were moving the two currencies and that they were both generally negative for the dollar and positive for the yen.
One is Japan's current-account surplus with the United States, reflecting trade in merchandise and services. The surplus has Japanese businesses turning more dollars from trade back into yen, strengthening the Japanese currency.
The other factor is that large institutional investors are sitting on their hands, refusing to take a position against the yen even though the economic fundamentals, including Japan's weak economy, low interest rates and poor prospects, point to a weaker currency.
"As long as investors stay away, the current account will push the yen higher and the central bank will still have to intervene," Mr. Persaud said, adding that he expected the yen to reach 105 to the dollar.
Japanese officials did not confirm the intervention publicly but made comments that seemed to indicate they had intervened. Several currency traders, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the central bank did intervene. The total sales, they said, ranged from $2 billion to $3 billion.
They said the intervention began in Tokyo trading and carried over into London dealings. It came after the dollar fell to a longtime low against the yen of 108.93 on Monday. But in late trading in New York yesterday, the dollar rose 3.2 percent, to 112.43. Early today in Tokyo, the dollar was trading at 112.45 yen.
The intervention, some traders said, was done through foreign banks, which might have been intended to send a stronger signal about the Government's desire to at least slow the yen's rally.
This was the first time that the Bank of Japan had intervened to reduce the value of the yen since April 1996. Along with the Federal Reserve system, the bank pulled off a surprise intervention in June to support the yen when it was approaching a level of 150. At the time, many analysts were worried that a weaker yen would cause a currency devaluation by China, aggravating an already troubling international economic crisis.
China held its ground, but the yen did not really begin to rally until August, when Russia effectively defaulted on its debt and devalued its currency, setting off fears of a wider and deeper financial crisis. Hedge funds and others who had lost money in Russia and other emerging markets began selling dollars and buying yen to lock in the big profits they had made betting against the yen. This selling snowballed, forcing others to sell and all of a sudden the yen was too strong, not too weak.
Mr. Persaud said there were now signs of the selling of dollars for yen by long-term institutional investors, like pension funds, which had held on during the speculative selling by hedge funds. This selling by long-term investors, Mr. Persaud said, may have been one of the factors that truly worried Japanese officials.
Jeremy P. Fand, senior foreign exchange strategist at BankBoston, expects the yen to lose value against the dollar over the next several months because Japan's economy is so weak and its rescue process is so haphazard.
But he also acknowledged that in the short term the yen would most likely rally and the dollar would fall. "We are expecting another test of 110 yen and below," he said. "People want to see some action" from the Japanese before changing their view.
In trading in Europe, the dollar slipped slightly against the new euro, although the euro is proving to have a weaker start than many analysts had expected. The euro was worth $1.15550 yesterday, compared with $1.15420 on Monday.

HEADLINE: Concern Rising About Mergers In Health Plans

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
The health insurance industry is rapidly whittling itself down to a few giant companies that dominate the health systems of some of the country's biggest cities.
Doctors and hospitals are increasingly concerned, and the trend is also raising questions about the cost and availability of care to millions of patients and their employers. 
 The criticism sharpened after the recent announcements of two billion-dollar deals that would propel Aetna Inc. to first place among the nation's health insurers. Last month, Aetna agreed to buy Prudential Health Care, the No. 5 for-profit managed care company, while it was still digesting its July purchase of NYLCare, No. 11.
Prudential Health Care, a unit of the Prudential Insurance Company of America, would thus join a pantheon of insurers swallowed in the last few years, including the health care divisions of Metropolitan Life, Travelers, New York Life and John Hancock. In only five years, a dozen companies have been scooped up by six survivors: Aetna, Cigna, United Healthcare, Foundation Health Systems, Pacificare and Wellpoint Health Networks.
Some health policy experts say they do not worry about big companies becoming bigger at the national level, if customers are thinly scattered. But with the acquisition of Prudential, Aetna would have 39 percent of the Philadelphia market and would take similarly potent positions in numerous other markets. It would have nearly 60 percent of managed care members in Houston, nearly half in Dallas and more than 30 percent in Atlanta, Philadelphia and the New York area, according to estimates by Sanford C. Bernstein, a Wall Street investment firm.
The Prudential deal quickly drew expressions of concern from groups monitoring patients' rights and doctors' groups like the American Medical Association and medical societies in a half-dozen states. Executives of large employers said they worried about the impact on cost and quality of care.
One worry is that payments to doctors will be trimmed, leading them to spend less time with each patient, which could hurt the quality of care. And patients fear that they will be forced to switch doctors.
For doctors and hospitals, the concern is not only that insurers dictate prices, but that if one or two insurers dominate a market, some doctors and hospitals will be left out in the cold. And employers worry about having fewer plans competing for their business, a trend already translating into higher premiums.
"The marriage of Aetna and Prucare will result in one company controlling over one-third of the New Jersey market," said Dr. David Swee, a New Brunswick family practitioner who is an official of the Medical Society of New Jersey.
And with about three of every 10 managed care members in Atlanta, Aetna "will be in a position to start dictating reimbursement rates," said David Harrell, chief executive of the Georgia Baptist Health Care System. "That is extremely dangerous. It ultimately has the potential of driving down quality" by pressing hospitals to discharge patients prematurely and skimp on supplies.
The insurance industry insists that these concerns are groundless, assuring critics that small regional insurers, as well as the hospitals' own H.M.O.'s, will always be around to provide competition. And they must be big in a given market, they say, to keep costs from spiraling out of control -- and to afford extensive information systems that may someday help improve patient care.
Critics dismiss such arguments. The New Jersey medical society has called for "appropriate action" by state and Federal antitrust authorities "to protect consumers, assure a vigorous market, and protect the patient-physician relationship." The New Jersey Citizen Action Group has also asked the state's insurance regulators to investigate the Aetna-Prudential deal.
The Prudential deal "could endanger patient choices and impair patient care," said Dr. Swee of the New Jersey society. The American Medical Association made the same point in a letter last month to the Justice Department's antitrust division.
In Philadelphia, even before the Prudential purchase, Aetna and a local Blue Cross company, Keystone Health Plan East, together controlled about four of every five members of H.M.O.'s and similar networks. With Prudential, Aetna would be even bigger.
"A marketplace this large should not be subject to a near monopoly," said Dr. Alan L. Hillman, director of the University of Pennsylvania health policy center. "If one of the two starts to gain a larger foothold, or the other one slips, we are going to have a true monopoly situation."
Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a national health care consumers organization, said consumers "would have good reason to be concerned" in markets where Aetna, which has adamantly opposed patient protection legislation, took a dominant position. "Other H.M.O.'s have been much more forthcoming in trying to be patient-sensitive and consumer-sensitive," he said.
Many employers are also frustrated, said Charles Blankensteen, a health care expert at the William Mercer consulting firm. "Choice in the marketplace is rapidly diminishing, customer service and value for the dollar are less than spectacular," he said. "Who bears the costs of these acquisitions? My bet is, it's the people who buy the services."
But insurance executives said plenty of competition remained.
"It's still a very fragmented industry," Richard L. Huber, Aetna's chief executive, said in a recent interview. "There's lots of competition" from Blue Cross plans and nonprofit H.M.O.'s. "The smaller regional guys will do just fine."
Mr. Huber predicted there would be "no more than three truly national players" -- Aetna, Cigna and Unitedhealth Group, until recently called United Healthcare. "We will compete with each other and against the Harvard Pilgrims," a big nonprofit H.M.O. with 1.3 million members in New England, he said.
"There will be fewer, bigger players and always an awful lot of local and regional players," said Leonard D. Schaeffer, chairman of Wellpoint Health Networks. Hundreds of hospitals have their own H.M.O.'s.
"Size matters," said Edward Hanway, president of Cigna Healthcare. "You need to have sufficient mass in major marketplaces." But he said he was "not convinced that there is a significant difference between 12 million members" -- Cigna's customers -- "and 20 million" -- Aetna's and Prudential's.
Industry executives said more consolidations were likely. Cigna, No. 4 in managed care, has just agreed to sell its property-and-casualty business to focus on health care and will soon have $4 billion available for acquisitions. Humana Inc., No. 6, has also been seeking a merger partner.
Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, already the largest insurers in many cities, have also been consolidating, with mergers and alliances in Connecticut and Indiana, central and western Pennsylvania, California and Georgia and Texas and Illinois.
"The health system is stumbling toward a bilateral monopoly of insurance companies and provider groups in every market," said Uwe E. Reinhardt, a health care economist at Princeton University.
If only one insurer is left to deal with local doctors and hospitals, Professor Reinhardt said, "they will send the bill to the consumer" by raising premiums. "Then the Government will say: 'You have converted health care into a public utility. We are going to regulate you.' "
Blue Cross plans are closely controlled in some states. For instance, the Michigan plan, which has two-thirds of the private insurance market in Lansing, is "regulated by the state and purchasers and unions on its board," said Paul B. Ginsburg, president of the Center for Health System Change in Washington.
Insurance executives reject Professor Reinhardt's argument, saying that statistics commonly used on Wall Street do not give the full picture, which should include not only managed care customers but also fee-for-service insurance and employers that self-insure.
By the more inclusive definition, Aetna is "still only a minority player, even in markets like New Jersey where we are the largest," said Joyce Oberdorf, an Aetna spokeswoman.
Size may be a mixed blessing in some states. "H.M.O.'s are struggling in Texas," said Margaret Jordan, a hospital consultant in Dallas, where hospital executives and doctors have loudly criticized H.M.O.'s, starting with Aetna.
The A.M.A., which has jousted with Aetna for months over harsh restrictions in doctors' contracts, said the acquisition would "create a dominant entity" that would "further diminish the ability of patients to receive the quality of care they seek."
In a letter to the Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission and state insurance officials in New Jersey and Connecticut, Consumers for Quality Care, a patients' advocacy group in Santa Monica, Calif., urged regulators to "disallow the proposed buyout."
"With greater market share in key cities and states," it said, "Aetna will have put itself in a position to offer more patients less coverage for ever higher premiums."
A.M.A. officials said on Friday that they had had preliminary discussions with Justice Department officials and would provide data to the Government this week to support the doctors' charges. In a rare indication of Government concern three years ago, Justice Department and F.T.C. antitrust officials asked a Federal appeals judge in Chicago to leave the door open for future cases against H.M.O.'s. Judge Richard A. Posner did so, remarking in his ruling that health plans "may vary in respects crucial to antitrust liability."
Federal antitrust officials declined to comment.
Robert Leibenluft, a health care lawyer in Washington who specializes in antitrust matters, said the Federal agencies had rarely, if ever, challenged H.M.O. mergers. Two years ago, the Justice Department cleared the acquisition of Metrahealth by United Healthcare, after United, at Missouri's insistence, agreed to sell a Metrahealth unit in St. Louis.
Mr. Leibenluft said it was unclear whether the managed care consolidations were "such that the H.M.O.'s would be able to raise their prices, and the buyers would not have an alternative." Even if an H.M.O. dominated a market, he said, the buyers might be able to switch to other types of insurance.
A "more serious issue," he said, would be whether doctors were locked into exclusive arrangements with a particular H.M.O. In a 1995 ruling, Judge Posner held that although an H.M.O. affiliated with the Marshfield Clinic in rural Wisconsin was "the dominant provider of medical services" in its region, the H.M.O. was not a monopoly because patients could consult the same doctors through other plans.
Several large employers said the merger trend had not paid off in better care.
Bruce Bradley, director of managed care plans at the General Motors Corporation, said he was "very concerned that the health care industry is moving away from local delivery systems and H.M.O.'s are becoming more and more like insurance companies," which mainly pay bills without focusing on providing appropriate care.
Mr. Bradley said the managed care companies had the potential to improve their information systems, attract "good local physician leaders" and press them to treat patients according to "best" practices. "The opportunities are good, but I haven't seen it happen yet," he said.
Alan Peres, manager of benefit planning for the Ameritech Corporation, said employers would be concerned to see if Aetna could "mesh these organizations together without creating employee relations nightmares" involving poor service to customers and angering doctors and hospitals by delaying payments.
J. Randall McDonald, an executive vice president of the GTE Corporation, said GTE would consider the quality of service and costs in judging the merged companies. "If it works to our standard, we'll be a good customer," he said. "If it doesn't, as we have done with others, we'll say they don't meet our criteria, and we'll move on."

HEADLINE: Report Issued Early Shows Rise in ProducerPrices

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 12

 BODY:
Prices paid to producers rose four-tenths of 1 percent last month after a record surge in cigarette prices more than offset declines in energy and food costs, the Labor Department said in a report that was posted by mistake on the Internet today, a day early.
For all of 1998, the Producer Price Index fell one-tenth of 1 percent; in 1997, the index declined 1.2 percent. This is the first instance since the Government began compiling the data in 1947 that the index has fallen for two consecutive years. 
 Wholesale cigarette prices rose 30.7 percent last month as tobacco companies began passing on the cost of a $206 billion settlement reached with 46 states to cover health care claims. Without those increases, the December index would have fallen four-tenths of a percent.
The index's core rate, which excludes food and energy costs, rose 1 percent in December. Producer energy prices fell 2.3 percent, and food prices dropped one-tenth of 1 percent. Without the cigarette price increase, the core rate would have fallen one-tenth of 1 percent.
The premature release of the report was the second such recent episode. The Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Nov. 6 that it was reviewing its procedures after some of the October employment figures were accidentally posted on the Internet.
Scott Sager, a spokesman for the bureau, said today's report was posted on the department Web site about 2 P.M. because of a computer error. He said the department deleted the information within an hour but later decided to release the data because some people had seen the posting.

HEADLINE: AIDS Is Still Here, But Donors Drift Off;
As Disease Lingers, Public Interest Wanes and Service Groups Falter

BYLINE: By LYNDA RICHARDSON 

 BODY:
When the Gay Men's Health Crisis announced last month that it would no longer hold a popular annual fund-raising event on Fire Island, the move did more than end the public relations nightmare that the Morning Party had become.
While the spectacle of merrymakers collapsing from overdoses and being arrested on drug charges had caused embarrassment for G.M.H.C., the nation's largest AIDS service organization, the cancellation of the summertime dance party highlighted a more serious fund-raising problem. 
 Faced with a decline in private contributions, the agency has eliminated more than a quarter of its staff positions in 15 months. It has also dissolved a research department and consolidated two other divisions. More cuts could be ahead for the agency, which relies on donations for 80 percent of its $22.4 million operating expense budget, a budget that has declined nearly $5 million from two years ago.
"It has been painful," said Ronald S. Johnson, the agency's managing director for public policy. "We're potentially chipping to the bone."
The decline in donations is not confined to G.M.H.C. With the advent of life-prolonging treatments and a significant drop in AIDS-related deaths, AIDS groups in New York and across the country are struggling. Donor fatigue has set in, even though H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, continues to infect 40,000 new people a year in the United States.
"AIDS in America is no longer considered a problem; everybody thinks it's gone away," said Larry Kramer, a writer who is one of the six co-founders of G.M.H.C. "Aside from that, it's happening to people who nobody wants to give any money to, poor people, people of color, drug users. In the beginning, when gays were threatened, gays gave money. But gays don't feel so threatened anymore. They are giving money to fight for gay marriage and other gay issues."
As donations migrate to other causes, AIDS groups are trying to reinvent fund-raising approaches and to devise fresh ones that might compel potential contributors. Some struggling groups are even considering mergers or pairing up with non-AIDS organizations.
For the first time, G.M.H.C. is taking part in the kind of fund-raising events that might have seemed ridiculously arduous a decade ago. Staff workers and volunteers, some of whom are H.I.V.-positive, will solicit pledges to run in the Marine Corps Marathon this fall in Washington. They will join contingents from AIDS Project Los Angeles and the Whitman-Walker Clinic in Washington, another AIDS organization.
Some AIDS groups are finding that they must venture further afield to find support. The 15 AIDS service organizations that are part of the Harlem Directors Group, for instance, are being encouraged to approach cancer groups for joint projects and financing.
"People are beginning to feel like they've probably given enough to H.I.V. and AIDS," said Ravinia Hayes-Cozier, the group's executive director. "For AIDS organizations, the ability to go beyond H.I.V. and AIDS is going to be important. Seven or eight years ago, I would have said you could not do it because of the emergency of the epidemic, but we cannot afford to just be a singular focus disease entity."
Raising money has become so difficult for the People With AIDS Coalition of New York, which offers informational phone lines, support groups and forums, that it is considering a merger with other AIDS service groups. Its executive director, Doug Wirth, said a quarter of the coalition's $1 million annual budget used to come from the bequests of AIDS patients. Now the amount is less than 5 percent because many people with AIDS are living longer.
As the coalition tries to replace those funds, it has also faced a drop in grants by the Government, which is directing more financing to outpatient health care and drug costs. "It's been a dramatic challenge and the question is, 'How long can that be sustained?' " Mr. Wirth said of the effort to maintain the coalition's budget.
By virtue of its name, G.M.H.C. is more closely linked to a gay donor base than most AIDS service organizations, and it has long been the most politically and economically connected group in the world of nonprofit AIDS service. Even so, G.M.H.C. has had to cut back, and it is seeking tenants to help it fill its 12-story headquarters in Chelsea.
With the cancellation of the Morning Party, the agency has lost its second largest fund-raising event after the AIDS Walk, which made $4.24 million last year, slightly down from the previous year. The dance party attracted 4,500 people and raised $464,000 in 1998.
"There's no way to say it's not a tough hit," said Mr. Johnson, the agency's managing director for public policy. "It will have an impact on the operation."
The Morning Party became a symbol of the agency's roots because the same community that gave rise to G.M.H.C. summered in Fire Island Pines, off the south shore of Long Island. Though the party began as a modest affair in 1983, it evolved over time into a swank event that attracted hordes of gay men.
"It was a huge piece of revenue and speaks directly to the core constituency of G.M.H.C., their leadership, their board," said Rodger McFarlane, a former executive director of the agency. "Those white upper-middle-class gay men are really important to G.M.H.C. and always have been."
In recent years, the gay dance party on the edge of the Atlantic lent cachet to a growing number of similar parties around the nation, known as "circuit parties." It also became increasingly associated with illegal drug use and unsafe sex.
Last year, in the predawn hours leading up to the Morning Party, a 35-year-old man from Bronxville, N.Y., overdosed and died. During the event, a party producer hired to oversee security and to weed out drug use was among 21 men picked up on charges of illegal drug possession. The year before, the same number of drug arrests occurred. And in 1996, a man slipped into a drug-induced coma and had to be evacuated by helicopter.
In recent years, as critics complained that the party was out of control, G.M.H.C. officials cited educating partygoers about the dangers of illegal drugs as one of the main reasons the organization remained committed to the event. The agency started holding drug counseling workshops on Fire Island around the party, and distributed fliers warning partygoers that illicit drugs would not be tolerated.
Now, in an effort to recoup the loss of revenue from the Morning Party, the agency is considering playing host at a series of smaller house parties in the Pines.
For some gay-rights advocates, the demise of the Morning Party signals the loss of a part of history.
"It's the only fund-raiser that G.M.H.C. had that was still gay, born in the gay community and targeting the gay community," said Randy Wojcak, a former organizer of the Morning Party who serves on G.M.H.C.'s education and program committee. "With the AIDS Walk, you see people with baby strollers, wives, husbands, brothers and sisters."
But Mr. Kramer, the co-founder of G.M.H.C., said gay men have never contributed as substantially to the agency as people might believe.
"The Morning Party was an old and tired idea, good riddance as far as I'm concerned," he said. "It's a drop in the bucket compared to what they need. They have a big building and a big staff and they haven't got the money to take care of all these things. There are a lot of wonderful programs that are really severely threatened."
During the last round of budget cuts, the talk was about which programs should stay and which ones might go. Among the programs that came under scrutiny was the buddy service, in which volunteers are paired up with sickly clients to do chores like shopping and laundry. The program, one of the agency's oldest, stays for now.
Meanwhile, volunteers like Dena Hammerstein hope the agency is through the worst. Mrs. Hammerstein devotes her time to the agency's Child Life program, which serves H.I.V.-positive women and their families.
Mrs. Hammerstein is also a longtime donor. She said she and her late husband, James Hammerstein, a producer who frequently directed the musicals of his father, Oscar Hammerstein 2d, raised about $10,000 for the program during the couple's silver anniversary celebration last year.
For five years now, Mrs. Hammerstein has volunteered twice a week. But because of the high staff turnover, she knows fewer of the staff workers these days.
"There's been a lot of upheaval all over," she said. "We volunteers have gotten more active. I think we felt a need to. We want to make sure we don't let our families down."

He said gay men are focusing on other causes. (George Ruhe for The New York Times)(pg. B3)

HEADLINE: ANXIETY GROWING OVER INDIAN CLAIM IN NEW YORK STATE

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

 BODY:
The Federal Government has joined the Oneida Indians in a lawsuit that contends the state and local governments unlawfully acquired 270,000 acres of land in central New York from the Indians nearly 200 years ago, whittling down what had been a sprawling reservation into a meager 32-acre plot.
Though the Oneidas' land claim has been wending its way through Federal courts since 1970, the subject of fruitless settlement negotiations between the Indians and two different governors, the Justice Department's intervention last year has galvanized state and local officials on the case as never before. 
 In particular, lawyers for the Justice Department and the Oneidas have provoked widespread anxiety and anger among private landowners by seeking to expand the suit to name not just the state, but also some 20,000 property owners in central New York as defendants.
The Justice Department and the Oneidas adamantly maintain that they have no interest in evicting people from their homes or forcing them to pay rent. They say the suit is intended to pressure the state into reaching a settlement. But such assurances have not stopped people from believing that their homes and farms are in danger, that they will be unable to buy or sell property or that banks will stop making loans.
"This is a very emotional issue and no amount of assurances are going to completely allay people's anxieties," said State Senator Raymond Meier, a Republican from Oneida County. "The only way to do that is to bring this to a rapid and complete conclusion."
The expansion of the suit to include individual landowners -- which would have to be approved by Judge Neal McCurn of Federal District Court in Syracuse -- comes at a time of simmering tensions between the Oneidas and some business owners, who contend that the Oneidas' tax-free status is putting them out of business. The Oneidas, who have become one of the region's largest employers, run a casino and hotel as well as several stores, restaurants and gas stations where customers do not pay sales tax.
"Ten or twelve family-owned businesses are now gone because the Indian businesses have an unfair advantage," said Assemblyman David Townsend, a Republican from Oriskany. "And they flaunt it in people's faces by advertising tax-free goods."
Now the Justice Department's involvement has also made the Federal Government a target of the anger. "It's amazing that they basically sided with a foreign nation against us," said Lisa Jensen, a 31-year-old landowner. "You hit yourself on the head and you ask where do my tax dollars go? Against me?"
Justice Department officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said yesterday that they decided to join the lawsuit last year at the request of the Oneidas, because their review of the case showed that the Indians had a right to the land and that negotiations with the state had clearly stalled.
The Oneidas contend that New York State violated the Federal Trade and Intercourse Act of 1790, which prohibited states from acquiring land from Indians without Federal approval. They argue that between 1795 and 1840, the state and local governments made 26 treaties and several purchase agreements with the Oneidas to acquire all but 32 of the 270,000 acres now in dispute.
Almost none of those transactions were approved by Congress, lawyers for the Justice Department and the Oneidas say, making the sales invalid.
In 1985, the Supreme Court upheld that argument in a "test case" filed by the Oneidas that named Oneida and Madison Counties as defendants and claimed just 900 acres. At that point, the state opened negotiations with the Oneidas, and the litigation was put on hold for the next 13 years, until the Oneidas and the Justice Department moved to expand the case in December.
The Justice Department's actions have prompted a spate of finger-pointing, with the Pataki administration and the Oneidas blaming each other for stonewalling the talks.
The Governor's office contends that negotiations have stalled largely because there are three groups of Oneidas who are parties to the lawsuit -- one in New York, one in Wisconsin and one in Ontario, Canada -- and that they have often feuded over strategy and goals. But aides to the Governor contended that even fractured talks with the Oneidas are preferable to the new legal tack chosen by the Justice Department.
"We think the Federal Government has turned its back on the people of central New York," said Michael McKeon, a spokesman for Gov. George E. Pataki. "We think it would be much more productive if they played a helpful role in negotiations rather than taking sides."
Responding to Mr. Pataki's criticisms yesterday, Justice Department officials said their goal is to reach a negotiated settlement, and they noted that they have agreed -- along with all the other parties -- to having a mediator appointed by the court to speed the talks.
Raymond Halbritter, the elected leader of the Oneida Indian Nation of New York, asserted that Mr. Pataki had been poorly served by his legal advisers, who did not recognize the Oneidas' frustration with the turtle's pace of the negotiations.
"We regret that we have to litigate," said Mr. Halbritter, whose grandmother, Mary Cornelius Winder, began advocating the land claim more than 70 years ago. "These are our neighbors and friends; we would like a future here. We know they are angry. But we think that most reasonable people, once they know the history, know we didn't want to sue so many property owners. But we really had no choice."
In addition to the Oneidas, New York State is embroiled in land claims cases with three other tribes: the Mohawk along the St. Lawrence River, the Senecas near Buffalo and the Cayugas in the Finger Lakes.
Over the past 25 years, the Federal Government has resolved at least 10 such Indian land claims in Connecticut, Maine and other states, usually by creating funds with state and Federal money that allow tribes to purchase land in a proscribed area from willing sellers, Justice Department officials said.
The lands acquired that way have then become part of their recognized reservations, exempt from local sales and property taxes and eligible for a variety of Federal services. Officials said they knew of no cases in which people who have purchased land in disputed areas have been forced to give it back to the Indians.
Officials in Oneida and Madison Counties, where the 270,000 acres are located, said there was no evidence yet that the suit had caused title insurance companies to stop issuing policies or banks to withhold mortgages. They also said there was no indication that property values had been affected or that people were having trouble selling land.
But Ralph J. Eannace, the Oneida County Executive, said he had heard of numerous cases of property owners canceling contracts to expand or improve their homes or commercial buildings.
"There is no question that the uncertainty raised by the possession claim is doing damage," Mr. Eannace said. "It has worried people, caused a great deal of anxiety and had a chilling affect on our economy."
Oneida officials have asserted that the land claim area has an assessed value of more than $1 billion. But they have signaled a willingness to accept less money than that in exchange for other concessions from the state. For instance, Mr. Halbritter has floated the idea of creating a large economic development zone where the Oneidas could use an array of tax incentives to attract large manufacturers to the region.
Last year, Mr. Halbritter also suggested that the suit could be resolved if the state allowed the Oneidas to open a casino at the Monticello Racetrack in Rockland County. But Mr. Halbritter said the Pataki administration demanded that 90 percent of the profits go to the state, which the Oneidas rejected.
State and Indian officials have also said privately that a land claims settlement could be used to resolve several long-standing issues between the Oneidas and the state.
For instance, the Oneidas have sought state approval to install slot machines and sell alcohol in their Turning Stone casino near Verona. And the state has been seeking Oneida approval for a system to collect sales taxes on gasoline and other products sold on Oneida land to non-Indians.
What is engendering some of the bitterness among property owners toward the Oneidas now is the Indians' new affluence. When the suit was first filed, the Oneidas had dwindled to a few hundred families, many of them living in trailer homes.
Today, the nation operates a successful casino, two hotels, a convention center, a T-shirt printing plant, five gasoline stations and eight restaurants. It employs 3,000 people.
But several local officials praised the Indians for bringing jobs to the economically struggling region. And they said the Oneidas' latest legal maneuver had at least forced public officials to focus on the problem.
"I was very unhappy with the suit the Oneidas filed," Representative Sherwood Boehlert, a Republican from Utica, said. "But the silver lining is that it has prompted everyone to pay attention."

Bumper Crops in 1998, But Farmers Face Losses

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 12

 BODY:
Corn and soybean farmers had bumper crops last year, but the loss of overseas markets and low prices brought economic trouble to many farm communities. Some analysts say this year will probably bring more of the same.
"We've got very large supplies but lackluster demand," said Mike Singer, an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. "I think it would almost take some sort of weather problem that cuts production to really give a big boost to prices." 
 Wheat farmers have already responded to last year's record low prices by planting less of their winter wheat crop this year, making it the smallest since 1972, the Agriculture Department said today.
The look at this year's crops came as the department released its 1998 crop figures. In many cases, like soybeans and corn, farmers had bumper production years.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
After Russian Lesson, Bond Prices Remain Stable in Latest Crisis

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
This time investors were better prepared to absorb the shock.
In contrast to the aftermath of Russia's collapse in August, the initial flight to safety that followed the Brazilian currency devaluation yesterday did not turn to panic in American stock and bond markets. Big bettors learned their lesson: Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. 
 Bond prices soared as soon as Brazil announced its devaluation; investors rushed to the immediate safety of the Treasury market. But bonds gave up much of their gain by the day's end, with the price of the 30-year Treasury bond rising 16/32 , to 10128/32 , and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, moving down to 5.13 percent, from 5.20 percent Tuesday.
In the corporate bond market, which froze up after the Russian collapse, big-name bonds rallied to trim their early losses by the end of the day.
There was even time for joking on trading floors once the American stock market began to recover. "How does Brazil solve its problems?" ran the big question of the day. The answer: "Change its name to Brazil.com, and it can take off like the Internet stocks."
When Russia suddenly devalued its currency and effectively defaulted on its debt in mid-August, investors around the world were stunned. Many refused to believe the United States and the International Monetary Fund would allow Russia to collapse until it actually happened.
But with that experience still fresh in the memories of market participants, Brazil's policy reversal -- which stopped far short of full-scale devaluation and default -- did not come as much of a surprise.
"A major lesson learned last summer was that there could be default on sovereign debt," said Denis Adler, the corporate bond strategist at Salomon Smith Barney. "People had forgotten that and discounted it as a risk then."
Meanwhile, investors have become much more risk averse, moving away from markets that they think are vulnerable. They are no longer borrowing so much, either, to make big bets -- known on Wall street as leveraging. That means they are not as vulnerable to outsized losses and panic selling to cover their loans. This kind of leverage was also at the heart of the near collapse of Long-Term Capital Management, the hedge fund whose losses spooked investors in September.
"Timing is very important," said Lawrence J. Brainard, the global head of emerging market research at Chase Securities. "The markets have had time to reduce leverage and exposure."
Jim Claire, the head of the taxable fixed-income trading desk at First Capital Group in Charlotte, N.C., said: "Everyone is saying it is not the end of the world. We have been down this road before."
Russia's collapse sent investors fleeing to the American Treasury market, pushing the yield on the 30-year bond down to 4.72 percent in early October. The fear of any risk effectively froze trading in the corporate and high-yield junk bond markets and even hindered the trading of older Treasury securities.
In response, the Federal Reserve, fearing that the smooth functioning of the world's financial system was threatened, cut its interest-rate target three times.
The Russian debacle also forced many money managers to sell profitable holdings they would normally have kept just because they had to offset huge losses in emerging markets like Russia, where selling was difficult.
Another factor that could contain the contagion this time is that there are very different players at the center of the trading action. In Russia, many of the losing bets were made by hedge funds that had put far too many of their investment eggs in one basket, forcing them to sell quickly. In Brazil, the big American and foreign banks are the main players in the currency market. They are bigger, more diversified and there is less pressure to sell, according to one executive at a major bank. And these institutions, after Russia, have trimmed their investments in Brazil and Latin America to lessen risk.
The situation is still delicate and the news from Brazil is far from positive for many investors. Uncertainty over what will happen next in Brazil is bound to hang over world financial markets for some time.
The cost of emerging-market debt rose sharply yesterday, although it, too, rallied a little by the end of the day. The J. P. Morgan emerging-market bond index, which shows the difference in the yield countries must pay to sell emerging market bonds and the yield on comparable United States Treasury securities, jumped to 14.26 percentage points yesterday. It is still below its peak of 17.05 percentage points in September but above its recent low of 9.44 percent in November.
Many of the problems in Brazil and other emerging markets "are still with us," said Desmond Lachman, the director of emerging markets economic research at Salomon Smith Barney. He said Brazil still had the potential to roil markets.
And Arturo C. Porzecanski, chief economist for the Americas at ING Barings, was worried that other shoes might still drop. The devaluation, he suggested, may be "too little and may be too soon."
"The other parts of the program are not in place yet," he said.
For all the nagging fears of the future, though, the reaction of American financial markets shows that the system is not as vulnerable to bad news as it was in August.

BRITAIN: CHILE WINS ROUND ON PINOCHET -- Chile won the right to present its case before the Law Lords next week on Gen. Augusto Pinochet's claim to immunity from arrest. Lawyers for Chile said they did not intend to contest the charges, only the right of countries other than Chile to judge the general. Lord Browne-Wilkinson, the chief Law Lord, said, "It would be wrong for them to be excluded." Warren Hoge (NYT)
 
FRANCE: E.U. SALVAGES COMMISSION -- The European Union averted a political crisis when key deputies in the European Parliament withdrew support for moves to dismiss the 20-member Executive Commission over allegations of fraud. The commission president, Jacques Santer, left, had threatened to resign if his cabinet was dismissed. (Reuters)
 
RUSSIA: PROTEST AGAINST SANCTIONS -- Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov criticized the United States for imposing sanctions Tuesday against three Russian institutions accused of helping Iran's weapons program. Washington accused the institutions of failing to prevent transfers of nuclear and missile technology to Iran. (AP)
 
GERMANY: BATTLE OVER CITIZENSHIP -- The Government submitted a bill to grant nationality to 4 million of the country's 7.4 million foreigners. Applicants would not have to surrender their original nationality. The parties opposing dual citizenship are confident that they can stop the bill with a nationwide petition. (NYT)
 
BULGARIA: . . . TILL BUREAUCRACY DO THEE PART -- At least 13,000 Bulgarian couples have been told they are not in fact married because municipalities had used unqualified officials to perform the marriages. (Agence France-Presse)

UZBEKISTAN: ALL THE NEWS THAT CAN'T BE HEARD -- BBC said its radio programs had been forced off the air in Uzbekistan, a former Soviet republic. Yuri Goligorsky, the BBC's chief regional editor, said an Uzbek request for the network to move to Soviet-era frequencies made its programs inaccessible to many. (Reuters)
 
MIDDLE EAST
 
LIBYA: 'PRACTICAL STEPS' ON LOCKERBIE -- Libya reported progress toward resolving the Lockerbie affair during a visit by two envoys, Prince Bandar bin Sultan of Saudi Arabia and Jakes Gerwel of South Africa, who are on a United Nations-approved mission to persuade Libya to hand over two Libyan suspects in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jetliner. The official news agency said "important practical steps" had been worked out with the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, but did not elaborate. Douglas Jehl (NYT)
 
IRAN: INTELLIGENCE AGENTS ARRESTED -- At least 10 intelligence officers have been arrested in connection with the killings of five dissidents late last year, the Teheran radio reported. Iranian officials have said the murders were carried out by rogue officers, a disclosure that prompted fresh calls for the resignation of the Intelligence Minister, Qorban Ali Dori-Najafabadi. Douglas Jehl (NYT)
 
AFRICA
 
ANGOLA: NO SURVIVORS AT CRASH SITE -- The Unita rebel group said it had found no survivors at the site where the second of two planes chartered by the United Nations crashed.

MEXICO: AIDS CASES RISE 14 PERCENT -- The number of AIDS cases grew by 4,745, or 14 percent, during 1998, to 38,390, the Government said. During 1997, 3,613 new cases were reported. The growth was sharpest in Aguascalientes, Durango and Guanajuato states, which have large numbers of migrants working in the United States. The Government counted 260,511 people in Mexico who are infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. Sam Dillon (NYT)
 
ARGENTINA: GENERAL HELD IN KIDNAPPINGS -- A judge investigating the kidnapping of babies from political detainees during the 1976-83 dictatorship ordered the arrest of a former army chief over his reluctance to testify. The officer, Cristino Nicolaides, was arrested at his home in Cordoba after telling the judge he was too ill to come to court. (Reuters)

HEADLINE: Retailers' 3d-Quarter After-Tax Profits Off

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 13

 BODY:
Profits after taxes at major United States retailers fell during the third quarter of 1998 to the lowest level in more than a year, the Commerce Department said today.
After-tax profits at major retailers with assets of $50 million or more averaged 1.9 cents a dollar of sales during the third quarter. That is down from the 2.3 cents in the second quarter and 2 cents in the third quarter of 1997. 
 Last year's third-quarter average was the lowest since an average of 1.5 cents a dollar of sales for the second quarter of 1997, the Government said.
Retailers' after-tax profits totaled $5.1 billion during the third quarter, compared with the second quarter's $6.1 billion. Profits after taxes totaled $5 billion in the third quarter of 1997.
After-tax return on stockholders' equity in the companies totaled 10.8 percent at an annual rate in the third quarter, down from a 12.8 percent rate in the second quarter and a 11.1 percent rate in the third quarter of 1997, the Government said.
The Commerce Department's estimates were based on quarterly financial reports from 503 retailers.

HEADLINE: A Test Case for Investing Inclusion

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
When the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson opens up the Wall Street Project conference on minorities and investment today, one of the central players is expected to be Mel Farr, who heads the nation's largest black-owned auto dealership.
Mr. Farr, who operates dealerships in Michigan, Ohio and Texas, has been held up by Mr. Jackson as one of the nation's leading minority entrepreneurs, a prime candidate for Wall Street to look to if it is going to invest in minority businesses and neighborhoods. 
 But Wall Street has not yet embraced Mr. Farr's effort to raise $45 million in a private placement of asset-backed securities to expand his Mel Farr Automotive Group dealerships.
"I don't have anything concrete yet," said Mr. Farr, who plans to meet this week with officials at Citigroup and Goldman, Sachs & Company. "This is a test. We want inclusion. I've got a portfolio of investment grade, and now I want to see if they're going to invest in an African-American business that does business in the African-American community."
In some ways, Mr. Farr, 54, might be seen as a test case for the Wall Street Project, which Mr. Jackson and Mr. Farr say is all about investing in the "emerging markets of urban areas."
"He comes to Wall Street looking for access to capital," Mr. Jackson said last night. "And we're going to work hard for him." Of Wall Street, he added: "They can't say they can't find a guy. They have a guy. He comes to the plate with all the qualities."
Indeed, over the last few decades, Mr. Farr, a former pro football player, says he has turned a bunch of failing dealerships in the Detroit area into a business with more than $600 million in revenue. He built his business selling and leasing cars in poor neighborhoods, to minorities with little or no credit, often at high interest rates. He says that for many it is their only way to get transportation for some jobs.
Although he caters primarily to minorities, he also has dealerships in largely white neighborhoods. His sales are often bolstered by television ads aimed at blacks that feature "Superstar Mel Farr" with Mr. Farr in a suit and a red cape. And until recently, there were also television ads that spotlighted a white actor in commercials done for a dealership in Fairfield, Ohio, which Mr. Farr says illustrates how difficult it is to cross over in some areas. "It's a market that is primarily white Americans, and I didn't want to turn off those customers because I am black," he said.

HEADLINE: France, in Break With U.S., Urges End to Iraq Embargo

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 13

 BODY:
France, making a formal break with the United States and Britain, proposed today that the Security Council lift the oil embargo on Iraq and institute a new weapons monitoring system to prevent Saddam Hussein from rearming.
"The embargo has become the wrong tool to achieve the goals of the Security Council," said the French proposal, which circulated today to all Council members. "It needs to be lifted." 
 The United States rejected most major points in the French proposal in advance at a Council discussion last month on Iraq. Keeping Iraq under tight sanctions, including forbidding the country to sell oil freely to raise money for arms, has been central to American policy.
The State Department spokesman, James P. Rubin, said today that the French proposals had "some positive elements," including the calls for continued arms monitoring and some supervision of oil earnings. But he reiterated the American position that sanctions could not be lifted until Iraqi arms programs had been rendered harmless.
"We have a number of questions and concerns that we are going to address to France about the proposal," Mr. Rubin said.
The initial reaction from Iraq, which would have to agree to a new monitoring system, was largely negative. Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan said at a news conference such proposals, including similar ideas floated by Saudi Arabia, "carry conditions that lead to exchanging eight-year-old sanctions with a new embargo."
The French said in their plan that the oil embargo could no longer be defended, because "it hurts the people of Iraq and keeps them hostages of their authorities."
France would lift solely the oil embargo initially, leaving in place other sanctions like a ban on international air travel. Other sanctions would be removed only if the Iraqis demonstrate cooperation and compliance with new rules. Conversely, additional sanctions could be imposed "should Iraq not comply with its undertakings and obligations."
The French propose replacing the arms inspection commission with a "renewed control commission" that would have a preventive rather than investigative role, watching for signs of illegal arms use from existing stocks or attempts to buy or produce new prohibited weapons. Long-term monitoring would replace intrusive searches for evidence of past programs.
Many tons of Iraqi weapons and ammunition have been destroyed since the end of the Persian Gulf war in 1991. But questions remain about unaccounted materiel like biological and chemical stocks and the missiles to deliver them.
Iraq was also found to have had a secret nuclear-weapons program. But the International Atomic Energy Agency has said it can find no evidence of arms or components to assemble them, a conclusion that independent American arms experts challenge.
Using language heard frequently from Iraq and Russia, the French proposal said that the control commission should "have its independence insured and it professionalism strengthened." In the past those have been code words for shielding the inspections from American influence or pressure and putting them under the United Nations international Civil Service structure.
Under the French proposal, which was first outlined on Tuesday to other permanent members of the Security Council -- Britain, China, Russia and the United States -- a financial surveillance system would be devised to watch Iraqi expenditures from oil profits.
The plan does not call for an escrow account to keep the money under supervision, as is now the case under the program that allows Iraq to sell limited amounts of oil to buy food, medicine and other goods needed to improve living standards.
Buyers of Iraqi oil and the Iraqi Government would have to notify the United Nations Secretariat, not the Security Council, of each sale. "Oil flows should be controlled on the ground," the proposal says.
The aim of financial surveillance would be to compel Iraq to meet its obligations to pay outstanding war claims and pay for a new monitoring system from oil earnings without "diverting these resources for the reconstitution of weapons of mass destruction."
The French are suggesting that all arms sales to Iraq be prohibited and imports of other materials that could be used in weapons development be policed and restricted. All other Iraqi purchases could be made freely without surveillance.
The United States has repeatedly said the oil embargo, the most important of numerous economic sanctions imposed after the invasion of Kuwait in 1990, cannot be lifted until the Iraqis have been judged to have met all disarmament requirements set out in the 1991 cease-fire resolution after the gulf war.
Those requirements have not been met. Existing resolutions governing them would, in effect, have to be annulled, a step that could paralyze the Security Council.
Although offering no proposals on salvaging the arms inspection system carried out by the United Nations Special Commission, the American delegation is expected to oppose monitoring methods that do not allow intrusive inspections, even though the Clinton Administration did not press for them for much of last year.
The French emphasize that their proposals are meant to generate debate and some action in the Security Council, which has been largely inert on the subject of Iraq since American and British bombing raids last month effectively killed the existing inspection system.
President Hussein has made it clear that the inspectors of the Special Commission, who were withdrawn hours before the air strikes, will never be allowed to return. Diplomats say they do not see how force can reimpose the work of the commission.
Today Vice President Ramadan was unequivocal, saying, "Any talk about the future of the commission, whether it has to do with beautifying its ugliness or to change one of its spies, its makeup or the role of one of its members, we say, is a waste of time."
In Paris the French Foreign Ministry said it was impossible to resurrect the Special Commission. "France thinks that it is time for the U.N. Security Council to consider that no progress can be made by an illusory resumption of previous methods," a statement from the ministry said.
The executive chairman of the commission, Richard Butler, continues to argue that the agency, known as Unscom, is not dead, and will have a new role to play in whatever system is ultimately devised.
The Iraqis will have to accept any plan imposed on them, however. Mr. Hussein has always chafed at international controls, and the French proposal maintains some significant ones.

HEADLINE: Fujimori's Burden in Peru: The Magic's Missing

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: CORPACANCHA, Peru, Jan. 10

 BODY:
Claudencia Martin Gustavo cheered when President Alberto K. Fujimori, defying the thin mountain air in this remote village 12,000 feet above sea level, took two women into his arms and twirled them in a vigorous Indian folk dance.
He cheered as the President passed out pink blouses and beige pants to local llama and alpaca herders. And he cheered again when the Peruvian leader, already in campaign mode, donned a rather unpresidential poncho, and talked about bringing telephones and electricity to this settlement of 1,000 people. 
 But Mr. Gustavo said he doubted he would vote a third time for Mr. Fujimori because "we don't have enough food and our incomes are not enough for our families."
A recession caused by stormy weather and the Asian economic crisis has swung Peru's political mood against the President, who has dominated this country for nearly a decade. Once widely popular for rescuing Peru from terrorism, cocaine trafficking and hyperinflation, Mr. Fujimori is struggling to recapture the magic that brought him two election victories. Whether he can regain it will determine if he will run again next year.
The son of Japanese immigrants, Mr. Fujimori bolted out of nowhere as an independent populist to win the presidency in 1990.
But he governed as a tough-minded free-market conservative. Faced with a spreading wave of terrorism, he unleashed the military and intelligence services and quickly captured the most important rebel leaders. He even ordered the air force to shoot down planes loaded with Peruvian coca paste destined for Colombia, leading to a rapid decline in trafficking and coca cultivation.
His "Fuji-shock" treatment yielded a wave of privatizations of inefficient state enterprises and attracted foreign capital.
And with crucial military support, he replaced the Congress and Supreme Court in 1992 with like-minded officials. His actions drew heavy criticism from the United States and human rights activists, but the terrorists lost ground and President Fujimori won re-election overwhelmingly in 1995.
But now support for the 60-year-old President in the polls has dwindled to about 35 percent. His popularity declined even after he negotiated a peace treaty with Ecuador late last year, forcing him to replace his Prime Minister and shuffle his Cabinet last week.
While Mr. Fujimori has not signaled his political intentions, his supporters say he is gearing up to run again. But some analysts say that if his poll ratings do not improve in the next six to eight months, he may decide to forgo the election.
His standing has deteriorated mainly because of a recession that resulted first from El Nino, which caused major flood damage and pushed important varieties of fish from Peru's shoreline, causing hardship for the country's substantial fish-meal industry.
A decline in commodities prices brought on by the Asian crisis, especially for Peru's copper and tin, has reduced economic growth. The Peruvian economy, which registered double-digit growth rates in the early 90's, stalled to zero growth in the last quarter. The unemployment and underemployment rate has risen in recent months from 40 percent to 50 percent.
"The people are hungry, unemployed and tired of Fujimori," said Javier Valle Riestra, who was Prime Minister for two months last year. "He can only make it to re-election by fraud and blood."
Mr. Fujimori has been buffeted by widespread criticism that he manipulated the courts and electoral tribunals to sidestep a constitutional ban on a third term. His claim that his 1992 "self-coup" improved the justice system has been tarnished in recent months by scandals, including the case of two judges filmed taking bribes from drug traffickers.
And a new book about Vladimiro Montesinos, Mr. Fujimori's unofficial chief of intelligence, describes the President as a virtual prisoner of a sinister, power-hungry spy. The book has become an instant best seller.
Mr. Fujimori cannot be counted out, however. The Ministry of the Presidency controls 40 percent of the national budget, and it is already turning on a pork-barrel spigot for bridges and roads. And the opposition remains splintered.
Nevertheless, opinion polls and political analysts suggest that the surge President Fujimori received in 1997 with the rescue of 71 hostages held by terrorists in the Japanese Ambassador's residence has faded.
"I would say re-election is possible, but very difficult," said Alfredo Torres, a leading Lima poll taker. "The question is whether the recuperation of the Peruvian and world economy will come fast enough."
In a recent interview, Mr. Fujimori predicted that his new Cabinet would help his Government recover much of its luster. He said he would be able to crank up economic growth by better than 5 percent this year -- far higher than the consensus 2 percent of independent economists -- unless neighboring Brazil suffers a complete economic meltdown.
Mr. Fujimori made many promises as he doodled on a piece of paper in a wood-paneled office in the Government Palace. He pledged to further reduce Peru's coca-growing area -- already cut by more than half in three years thanks partly to eradication -- by an additional 20 to 30 percent this year. He predicted that the new treaty with Ecuador would lead to yearly savings of $400 million in military spending. And he promised to hunt down the handful of rebels left in the mountains.
"Before there was terrorism, now there is stability," Mr. Fujimori said, as if practicing a campaign speech. "Before we had economic chaos, now we have order. Before we were isolated internationally, now we have friends again. Before we had conflict with Ecuador, now we live in peace."
He refused to rule out a re-election bid, adding, "I don't have to decide yet." But for the last two years, Mr. Fujimori and his allies who form a majority in Congress have been acting as if he intends to run in 2000.
The 1993 Peruvian Constitution prohibits the President from running for a consecutive third term. But in 1996 Mr. Fujimori's supporters in Congress passed a law that granted him an exception, arguing that his first term did not count since it began before the new Constitution was written.
Members of the opposition appealed to the seven-member Constitutional Tribunal, saying the exemption was unconstitutional. Three of the judges agreed, three abstained, and the head judge upheld the 3-to-0 decision against Mr. Fujimori. In May 1997, Congress dismissed the three judges who opposed their law on the ground that they had exceeded their authority, opening the way for a third Fujimori campaign.
The opposition mounted a signature drive to petition Congress to hold a referendum on the issue of a third term. By July 1998 it had collected enough signatures, but the Congress ruled that two-thirds of its members would have to clear the way for any referendum, and President Fujimori's majority blocked it.
"They do not trust civilian, democratic institutions," said Lourdes Flores Nano, an opposition Congresswoman. "The polls say he can't win, but if the group at the head of the army insists on Fujimori, the possibility of fraud is very high."
Mr. Fujimori denied that he had manipulated the system and said Congress was doing its democratic duty.
He underscored how much Peru has changed on his trip to Corpacancha. He would not have dared come to this Andean village 85 miles northeast of Lima without an army battalion when he first took office in 1990. In those days, Shining Path terrorists played soccer with the skulls of their victims in these highlands.
But this Sunday, Mr. Fujimori dropped by this settlement in a helicopter with only a light escort of bodyguards to enjoy a mountainside picnic, pass out gifts and promise new roads, tourism projects and credits to expand the villagers' production of llamas, alpacas and sheep.
As the peasants swelled around him as they received their gifts, he cried out: "Order! Order! This country needs order, no?" The peasants dutifully obeyed and the chaos gave way to three neat lines.
In appreciation for the presidential gifts, the peasants gave Mr. Fujimori a sheep with the Peruvian flag tied around its neck and a hunk of barbecued alpaca to go with the French wine and Polish vodka he brought along on the trip.
Then Mr. Fujimori assembled the reporters traveling with him, and via satellite telephone gave a nationally broadcast news conference.
"This Government gets results," President Fujimori told his people.

HEADLINE: Ex-Aide to Reagan Will Head the Congressional Budget Office

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 13

 BODY:
Dan L. Crippen, who worked for President Ronald Reagan and for Howard H. Baker Jr., the Senate majority leader in the early 1980's, was chosen today to be director of the Congressional Budget Office, a powerful agency with an influential voice in debates on economic and social policy.
Pete V. Domenici, the New Mexico Republican who is chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, announced the selection, after getting agreement from the Senate Republican leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, and the chairman of the House Budget Committee, John R. Kasich, Republican of Ohio. 
 Mr. Crippen, 46, is more clearly identified with a political party than any of his predecessors. But he is expected to continue the agency's tradition as an independent, nonpartisan source of information.
The budget office estimates the cost of every significant bill that goes to the floor of the House or the Senate; makes projections of Federal spending and tax revenues, and forecasts how the economy will perform. The Congressional Budget Office can, in effect, kill legislative proposals if it estimates that they will significantly increase the deficit or reduce the surplus.
Mr. Crippen worked on economic and domestic policy on Capitol Hill and at the White House. He went to the White House with Mr. Baker in 1987, when Mr. Baker became chief of staff for Mr. Reagan. Since leaving the White House in February 1989, Mr. Crippen has been a Washington lobbyist. His current clients include the Ford Motor Company, General Electric, Merrill Lynch and the Baxter Healthcare Corporation.
Kenneth M. Duberstein, former deputy chief of staff in the Reagan White House, described Mr. Crippen as "a pragmatic conservative."
Mr. Crippen would be the fifth director of the budget office. Democratic members of Congress say they see him as a mainstream Republican, but worry that he does not have as much formal training in economic theory as his predecessors. He received a bachelor's degree from the University of South Dakota and a Ph.D. in public administration and economics from Ohio State University in 1981.
The budget office director serves a four-year term and is jointly appointed by the Speaker of the House and the President pro tem of the Senate.
Republicans chose the agency's current director, June E. O'Neill, but House Republican leaders harshly criticized her last June. In a letter, they said that the budget office had been "consistently wrong" and had repeatedly understated economic growth and overstated budget deficits.
In a meeting with Mr. Crippen this week, Senator Lott made clear that he saw plenty of room for improvements. Some conservative Republicans have complained that the agency is dominated by what they see as the old-fashioned liberal views of career civil servants in senior positions.
Prof. William H. Oakland, who advised Mr. Crippen on his doctoral dissertation, described him as "a low-key but tenacious guy" and said he was "one of my favorite students in 35 years of teaching." In an interview, Mr. Oakland said: "Dan's training in economic theory is not as rigorous as that of some people with a Ph.D. in economics, but he has more training in areas directly germane to the operation of government, like budgeting, management and the legislative process."
From 1989 to 1996, Mr. Crippen was senior vice president of the Duberstein Group, a consulting firm. Since 1996, Mr. Crippen has been a principal in Washington Counsel, a law and lobbying firm.

HEADLINE: Progress Is a Slow Train for Girls' Teams

BYLINE: By LENA WILLIAMS 

 BODY:
Oshto Edobor-Osula, 17, plays basketball.
At the school she attends, Jamaica High School in Queens, there is a girls' team. But the team plays home games in a third-floor gymnasium that has no bleachers and, until recently, no time clock. Students who attend games either stand for four quarters or drag chairs in from nearby classrooms. 
 "The downstairs gym where the boys' basketball team plays has bleachers, so they usually get a larger crowd than us," Oshto said softly. "I don't think the girls' team gets the support of the student body. But that's understandable. Nobody wants to stand for an hour to watch a basketball game."
Oshto stands as a 6-foot-3-inch reflection of sports programs for girls in the New York city public school system: although there is growing awareness of the need to improve and expand athletic opportunities for girls, inequities still exist between boys' and girls' programs. That the facilities are meager, and often worse than the boys', is par for the course. That girls like Oshto are playing team sports at all counts as significant progress. Consider this: today, 155 of 165 high schools have some girls' sports programs, but 45 of them offer 3 or fewer.
Although more girls than ever are now playing high school sports -- about 18,000 of the system's 40,000 student athletes are girls -- there are 134,000 girls who may still be missing out, whether by design or choice. Many may have interpreted the meager resources, the drastic cutbacks in physical education and an overall environment that fails to actively encourage girls to participate, as indications that sports are not important.
"If you ask some of the girls here to play basketball, it's like you're trying to teach them something from Mars," said Susan Sucreta, a physical education teacher at Jamaica.
While all things may never be equal when it comes to the games boys and girls play, this past year, the Public Schools Athletic League, the Board of Education agency responsible for administering high school sports, increased funds for girls' sports programs by more than $1 million and approved requests for nearly a third more girls' varsity and junior varsity teams.
"Obviously, we've done a complete turnaround, in terms of the numbers of sports programs offered boys and the numbers offered girls," said Thomas Hemans, director of the P.S.A.L.
Whatever gains girls have achieved, however, they often came through court mandates or public advocacy, and typically amount to little more than the bare necessities.
"The reality is that sports programs are shortchanged," said Kenneth Trell, assistant principal and athletic director at Jamaica. Trell acknowledged that his attitude was shaped not only by his role as educator, but also as the parent of a 10-year-old daughter. "In order to get the extras, a lot of student athletes have to fund-raise. As a parent, I resent that."
Besides, the extras usually go to the boys. Girls are lucky to get the leftover leftovers. It may not be fair, but in some financially strapped school districts, it's not even an issue: parents just aren't prepared to spend hard-earned money on candy or greeting cards to pay for new protective vests for the fencing team. "Because it's such an institutionalized setup that sports is for boys and girls are on the fringe, it's taken a very long time to overcome sexual discrimination in the sports programs provided through the P.S.A.L.," said Barbara T. Rochman, whose 1994 Board of Education task force found widespread discrepancies in spending on girls and boys programs.
Nationwide, the number of girls attending college on sports scholarships has risen from 19,203 in 1992-93 to 25,284 in 1996-97, the National Collegiate Athletic Association says. It can't be determined whether the city has maximized girls' chances for scholarships. That responsibility rests mainly with school administrators, coaches and athletes. The P.S.A.L. and the Board of Education don't keep scholarship data.
 Nearly everyone acknowledges that, had the city spent more money and had concentrated more effort at promoting sports for girls, and making it easier for them to play, many of the chances for scholarships that are out there for the begging might have been gained.
Schools such as Jamaica, at least, are making an honest effort and have succeeded more than most in giving girls a fair shot at athletics, be it competitively or through physical education. Yet Jamaica, like so many other schools, struggles daily to change the athletic ethos within the school and beyond.
There are also intangibles to consider, things such as the ethnic and cultural traditions that often shape girls' attitudes about femininity, competition and aggression. Even with opportunities, black and Hispanic girls are less likely to play on a sports team than whites, according to the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.
The reasons for such discrepancies vary, say experts like Dr. Mary Jo Kane, director of the Tucker Center for Research on Girls and Women in Sports at the University of Minnesota. "Economics, family priorities," she noted, adding that her observations were rooted chiefly in anecdotal evidence. "When you have groups who historically have been marginalized and stigmatized with respect to certain issues like sports, for females in general and blacks in particular, it's not enough to put a sign up and say come play. It takes progressive outreach."
Tiehise Shell and Shawana Wilson, members of Jamaica's girls' track team, are black teen-age girls who have managed to excel, academically and athletically, in spite of the system.
The two seniors have received several scholarship offers from colleges and universities and their parents scraped together the money to pay for outside coaches. "The city should be doing more for us," said Tiehise as Shawana nodded in approval. "They don't even pay for our transportation to meets."
 At the least, they said, some support from top city officials would help. "Each year, we have a Mayor's Trophy meet, but the Mayor doesn't come," Tiehise said. "Why do we have a meet for him, and he doesn't come. We're not asking him to stay. Just come, wish us good luck and then he can say, 'Goodbye.' "

HEADLINE: Separate but Unequal: 2 Schools' Tales

SERIES: DROPPING THE BALL: The Decline Of School Sports -- Second of three articles.

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
Tottenville High School, at the southern tip of Staten Island, has one of largest expanses of artificial turf in the world, a sprawling $7.3 million hyper-green carpet on which it can conduct three major sporting events at once without conflict. At Thomas Jefferson High School in Brooklyn, the sports program went broke last spring, forcing the school's principal, Lena B. Medley, to beg the P.T.A. for a handout.
Students and alumni at Tottenville raised most of the cost of a $5 million field house last year through donations of cash, labor and material. Coaches at Jefferson raise $20, on a good day, selling coffee and doughnuts outside the school office to buy uniforms for the track and soccer teams. 
 Both schools get the same funds from the city: about $2,500 for all their teams for a whole year, not counting stipends for coaches. And while Tottenville, with 3,800 students, raised about $75,000 from the local community to make its program the envy of the city, Jefferson, with 1,500 students, struggled to raise $10,000 to try to get by.
Neither school gets enough money or support from the city for even a minimal athletic program. Where they differ is in how they face that problem, and in the consequences that play out in the lives of students and teachers and coaches in two deeply dissimilar corners of New York. Sports at Tottenville and Jefferson, in their individual stories of scramble and struggle, reflect the economic health of their communities and the apathy or enthusiasm of coaches and parents. And the city's school sports program makes no attempt to even things out.
"Some got it, some don't -- that's essentially it," said Jefferson's head football coach, Keith A. Merriman, who had to tell his team this year -- for the first time in a 22-year coaching career -- that there wasn't even enough money to buy new football jerseys, and that last year's would have to be used. "In a lot of instances, you're paying for where your school happens to be located, not for what you can do as a coach, or even what kind of kids you have in your program," Mr. Merriman said.
Sports in the New York City public schools once offered a mechanism for bridging the lives of young people from different backgrounds. A team traveling to another school for a game could be reminded that kids are kids, and that there are often more similarities that unite than differences than divide. But that bridge has become harder and harder to provide. As the burden of maintaining school athletics has been shifted to the schools over the last two decades, places like Tottenville and Jefferson really have become independent and different.
The stark differences in New York's neighborhoods -- economic as well as cultural -- have been underlined and emphasized by its public school sports programs, rather than diminished. School sports, under such conditions, are evolving differently in each place, as schools search for a path forward.
At Tottenville, for example, about one out of four students this year is participating in a school sport -- more than 1,000 teen-agers on 41 different teams, from freshman baseball to handball and fencing. At Jefferson, 22 miles away and in the heart of East New York, only one student out of eight participates -- 180 boys and girls on 18 teams. At Tottenville, students ride buses to events. At Jefferson, they mostly take public transportation or ride with their coaches -- violating school-system rules -- because chartered buses are not an option.
There were always differences between New York high schools, of course -- some had good teams, some didn't. But the new inequality extends beyond final scores and good and bad teams. Now, there are the haves and the have-nots. Some schools have access to the money needed to run a high-quality athletic program. Others are frozen out. Some schools can get nice uniforms, and others are reduced, as was the Brooklyn girls' volleyball team that visited Tottenville for a game earlier this year, to taping their numbers on old T-shirts.
Some schools have playing fields in good repair; others go to practice with coaches and players holding their breath as to who might turn an ankle in a rut, or fall on a jagged rock.
But Tottenville and Jefferson also share certain haunting similarities.
Jefferson, known to generations of New York students as simply, "Jeff," occupies a massive brick-and-stone building that dominates its neighborhood. Its tiled hallways and 70-year-old honor roll plaques resonate with a weighty grandeur, echoing the decades when its name was associated with all that high school -- both in sports and schooling -- meant in New York.
Stories are still told here about Jefferson legends like the football coach Moe Finkelstein. He retired 12 years ago, but coaches still remember, even today, how he took his coffee: black. And if you took it any other way yourself, you were a wimp.
Tottenville's grandeur is different, but just as evident. Designed in the 1960's to look more like a college campus than an old-style urban school fortress, it sprawls across the land, languid in its dominance. There are no metal detectors, no guards patrolling the halls. Tottenville is about as relaxed as a high school can be in New York City.
Yet both schools are isolated: Jefferson by poverty, Tottenville by geography. There are no grocery stores or movie theaters or shopping malls near either one. As institutions, they are both still powerful landmarks and symbols, but the roles they play in their very different worlds have diverged.
 
Community Anchor
'Small-Town' Lives Focused on Sports
In the early 1990's, when the rest of the New York City school system was being transformed by an innovation called "educational options," in which a student could choose a high school other than the one in his or her own neighborhood, Staten Island held itself apart. Parents groups came forward, saying they liked the old ways. The Board of Education created a system called "internal choice" for the Staten Island schools that allowed them to keep their traditional roles as community anchors, schools that students in a given geographic area were expected to attend.
The superintendent in charge of high schools in Staten Island and Western Brooklyn then, Noel Kriftcher, said he thought that allowed Tottenville High School to keep its role as the centerpiece of life on the southern edge of Staten Island. And that, in turn, has fed back on the school's sports teams, which still stand for and captivate community and student spirit in a way that much of New York City has forgot.
"Schools in Staten Island are still largely tied to communities," Mr. Kriftcher said. "You don't have that in a lot of areas of New York City anymore, where schools are smaller or newer or are no longer identified with a particular community."
Tottenville is not, by any measure, New York City's richest neighborhood. The annual income per person in the school's zone is just slightly higher than that of the city as a whole. But the winding, often wooded thoroughfares like Hylan Boulevard feel more like Westchester County or New Jersey. Unemployment is lower than in the rest of the city, at about 5 percent, and home ownership rates are higher -- with about three of four residents in the district owning their own homes, according to the United States Census Bureau.
But the bigger force is stability, residents say. It's easy to find people whose grandfathers and grandmothers grew up in Tottenville and never left. More than half of the teachers at the school have been there for more than 20 years.
"Usually a generation picks up and goes, but people here didn't pull out," said Bill Leyes, owner of Tottenville Trading, an antique shop. "A lot of us are still together, that's all. I've been here 40 years."
That stability has also created, or preserved, a kind of cloistered world. In a vast city where people often barely even know their neighbors, Tottenville is a small town.
"When I see someone I don't know," said Rabiye Tala, a 17-year old soccer player at Tottenville, "I think, 'How come I don't know them?' "
And sports -- focused through Tottenville High, like light through a lens -- is the mechanism that gives small-town Tottenville its identity and its passion. It's what people have in common.
At a time when the Board of Education is distancing itself from the daily operations of high schools sports, Tottenville's stubborn retention of old-fashioned sports boosterism has become an overwhelming trump card that connects directly to money and student participation and, many coaches in and out of the school say, to victories. In the last six years, the school has won more than a dozen city championships in football, baseball, soccer and track.
Indeed, sports is not so much an extracurricular activity in this school as it is an embrace. Local residents, including many former Tottenville athletes, volunteer to help coach. The annual sports parade through the center of Tottenville every April is one of the biggest events of the year.
Janet Mosscuzza, Tottenville's girls' volleyball coach and assistant athletic director, said she was approached last year after a game by a little girl -- maybe 6 years old -- probably some 10 years away from high school, but already hooked by the school's mystique. "She said, 'I want to play for Tottenville one day,' " Ms. Mosscuzza said.
And parents are involved -- sometimes, almost too involved, coaches say. Their interest is constant, a blanket of sometimes almost smothering attention that coaches say they value and respect and can't ever ignore. Parents who work as stockbrokers and crane operators adjust their schedules to watch their children play. One father said he left the company he worked for so he could be a self-employed consultant who could attend his son's football games.
"I get calls all of the time," said Alan Blanc, Tottenville's athletic director. "I get calls from parents on freshman teams wondering why their son isn't playing." Sometimes, he added, "The parents care more than the kids."
Of all Tottenville sports, baseball is where that passion rises to its fever pitch. Parents even come to practices. "We enjoy a cup of coffee and watch them practice," said Linda Maklari, who has two sons on the team. "We eat, drink and sleep baseball here."
The Tottenville baseball parents club holds monthly meetings where guest speakers, including professional players and school alumni, talk to team members about hitting, training and schoolwork. When report cards come out, parents and the coach discuss the player's grades. "It's like one giant baseball family," Ms. Maklari said.
Many parents become so close through baseball that they even take a winter cruise together, a family affair where baseball remains a topic of discussion. "The boys even bring their gloves," she said.
 
The Cruelest Truth
Jefferson's Enemies Are Close at Hand
Michael Tucker, a wisp of a 15-year-old who looked all the skinnier for his oversize jeans, walked slowly across the field early last fall, a bag slung over his shoulder. He arrived, still without speaking a word, in front of Keith A. Merriman, Jefferson's head football coach, and methodically unpacked a scuffed pair of cleats, a set of worn shoulder pads, a faded practice jersey. He placed them carefully on the grass and rezipped the bag.
Only when he stood back up did he speak, and only then was it clear why he had waited. Speaking softly, he told the coach he was sorry, but he couldn't play football anymore because his mother had just kicked him out of the house and he was, as of that morning in late August, 10 days before the start of the school year and the football season, homeless. Making sports work in New York, more than ever, depends on the enthusiasm and support of families and communities -- money is just a reflection and expression of that fact.
And at Thomas Jefferson that is in many ways the cruelest truth. As much as the coaches and teachers might criticize the city's sports structure for abandoning the old ideals and standards of financing, the greater enemy is closer to hand, they say: apathy, poverty, the collapse of the family and the erosion of what holds a neighborhood together -- that's what really did in the Orange Wave.
Mr. Merriman and the junior varsity coach, Ernie General, glanced at each other with a deep, familiar weariness as Michael stood before them that day. What was the story, they asked. Where did his mother live? Did he have any other relatives? Mr. General wrote down names. Mr. Merriman said he would call Michael's mother.
"Kids shouldn't have to deal with this," Mr. Merriman said, shaking his head as he watched Michael fade into the distance.
On Jefferson's football squad of 28 boys, only 3 have both parents at home. And at the team's opening game, coaches said, only one parent came. The team was unable to raise the money for new jerseys this year, partly because of the crushing poverty in this part of the city, but also because the parents' booster club fell apart.
Attendance at Jefferson games has also nearly collapsed. Even as recently as the early 1990's, Saturday football games would attract 500 or more paying fans. Recent games, even with a winning team, have drawn only a few dozen fans at most games.
And fewer fans, coaches say, have reinforced the desolation of the school's field on Flatlands Avenue. Prostitutes who troll the streets of a nearby industrial zone sometimes bring their customers behind the field. Homeless people have erected lean-to shelters against a back fence. Even the cheerleaders, who don't have real uniforms anyway, don't seem to want to come -- they were only seen at Homecoming.
 Holding together a sports program here means a constant search, coaches and administrators say, for ways to connect to a disconnected community. In the school zone that surrounds Jefferson, nearly half of the adult residents are not in the labor force; they have given up looking for jobs.
East New York had the highest homicide rate in the city last year. Two-thirds of the residents have no cars, and poverty is enduring and deep -- more than one in eight of the households in the school's district earned less than $5,000 in 1997, according to United States Census Bureau figures.
Claude Robinson, Jefferson's athletic director, almost cries when he tells some of the sports stories that he says result from such conditions. They are not tales of financial woe for the most part, but of aborted hope. Last year, for example, a girl entered the school who made every coach's head turn, Mr. Robinson said. She was 6 feet 5 inches. She had never played basketball even once in her life, she said. But Mr. Robinson knew that didn't matter, and he went to see her parents, anyway.
"She was from a poor family, and we tried to explain to her father that this was a means of getting her through college," Mr. Robinson said. "We guaranteed her scholarships -- there was no doubt."
But the father said no. "His attitude was that she should come home and cook dinner," Mr. Robinson said of the girl's father.
Sometimes, though, there are small victories. Michael Tucker's mother changed her mind after a visit from the Jefferson coaching staff. She took her son back in and he resumed his spot as a guard and linebacker on the football team -- never missing a game.
 
Coffee and Sympathy
$10 to $20 Daily Lets Students Play
Bill Sioukas teaches gym every day for his living. But he sells coffee and doughnuts every morning so that Jefferson High can have soccer and track. Mr. Sioukas and Claudel Martin, Jefferson's track coach, came up with the idea about three years ago -- a mini-business that kicks out about $10 to $20 a day in profits for the combined fund that the coaches and friends call their war chest. The coffee cart helps pay for uniforms and transportation.
But it has also come to mean more than that. It has become a vehicle and a rallying point, a new social connection and a way of making a statement about perseverance and resourcefulness. Teachers who never talked to each other before say that they now routinely gather for a moment before the day begins. Students have volunteered to help with the business, Mr. Sioukas said, and have contributed helpful ideas.
"The kids see you working hard, they want to work hard too," Mr. Sioukas said.
Fund-raising for high school sports in New York is not an end in itself, but rather a mirror that shows how things work. And in the life of this one coach, stopping at Krispy Kreme every morning at 6:20, pouring cups of coffee and collecting coins -- all the while reminding himself of why he's doing it -- there is a deep reflection of values.
Jefferson raises about $8,000 to $10,000 a year to run its sports program. It does get some external support: A nearby church, St. Paul's Community Baptist, has become involved, local politicians, including the local Congressman, Representative Edolphus Towns, are occasionally enlisted for help, and the P.T.A. can be squeezed.
But in a poor neighborhood full of parents who are either struggling financially or uninvolved with the life of the school -- or both -- Jefferson's coaches and administrators say they have to depend on themselves to make sports happen. As with the school itself, with its uniformed officers patrolling the hallways and its metal detectors -- a legacy of violence in and out of the building -- sports here exists in a kind siege mentality. Surrounded by apathy, it lives or dies by what can be cultivated inside school walls. Things like the coffee cart, in which most of the proceeds come from the faculty, reflect and reinforce the school's isolation.
Mr. Martin, the track coach, has a whole closet full of old sweatsuits in the gym -- collected and saved, tattered but still usable for athletes who have no other recourse. They're free for the asking for those who have no other choice but to ask.
"My coach never had a closet like this," he said. "But now you have to because some kids just don't have them."
Fund-raising at Tottenville includes categories that just don't exist in East New York: advertising revenue, for example. Local businesses support the school's sports teams, taking out ads in regularly published sports guides and game programs. Other stores provide goods at a discount to the school or to athletes, or donate them. Free labor and building supplies for construction or repair projects are abundant.
Money for sports is so available that supply can sometimes outstrip demand. The Tottenville Little League -- a main feeder for the school teams -- is so big and such a visible marketing opportunity that local businesses must put their names on a waiting list if they want to sponsor a team.
There are cake sales at sports events, and raffles, and alumni fund drives -- a humming network of parents and businesses and residents that looks to the school as its natural nexus for donations of time and money. Tottenville even gets more money per ticket at its football games than Jefferson: $4 a ticket, compared to $1 to $3 in East New York. "We're in the catbird seat here," said George Kaplan, the girls' soccer coach. "If we haven't raised enough money for something, then the parents just pay for it. There's a lot of support for the sports teams here, and that's what it's all about. That makes a big difference."
 
Success Stories
Colleges Come Calling For 2 Hard Workers
Mike Martinez's success on the football field -- he plays both defense and offense and was voted last month to the New York City Coach's All-City team as a tight end -- and his satisfactory performance in the classroom at Jefferson are celebrated in a school that has struggled in so many ways over the years. He's good enough to get major recruiting attention from some of the best and biggest Division I colleges in the nation, and competent enough academically, in his S.A.T. scores and grades, to qualify.
But his distinctiveness also shows the long dark road that sports has traveled through at the school. The last time an athlete won a major college football scholarship was the year Mike was born, 1982.
The school's attitude about sports has changed as well. What sports are here, what they mean, and what function they are meant to perform in the lives of students, is evolving and changing. Athletics for its own sake is not celebrated the way it once was.
Four years ago, when she came to Jefferson as principal, Ms. Medley, unilaterally raised the school's academic standards for eligibility to play sports. The Public Schools Athletic League, which regulates public school sports, mandates that a student must have a 65 percent average in his or her classes, but Medley boosted it to 75, and laid down other new rules, as well. Student athletes have to attend daily mandatory homework sessions with their coach and S.A.T. test-taking workshops on Saturdays during their sport's season -- miss either one, the new rules say, and you don't play.
"Years ago it was felt that the only way for certain people to get out of certain circumstances and situations was for them to go into sports," Ms. Medley said. "But today you can get on a computer and get out of the ghetto a lot quicker than you can running down the field with a football under your arm. Sports is being downsized to a certain degree, but that's all right."
For Mike Martinez, however, the passion for sports is utterly undiluted. He is shy, soft-spoken and fiercely driven. He does 500 pushups every day in his room, all yearlong, except during football season, when he slacks off to 100. His parents, Blanca Martinez and Michael Stewart, say they have no ready explanation for the way he is -- unstoppable and relentless -- except that he just seems to have been born that way.
Mr. Stewart said that when Mike was little, that he used to pick him up and hold him to look out the window at all the kids running wild around their housing project.
"I'd say, 'See that? Their parents don't care about them because they're letting them run around,' " he said. "You should be home, or in school, somewhere where you're parents know where you're at -- I guess that instilled something in him. Pride I guess."
But Mike has also been affected by the environment of a school, and neighborhood, where luxuries and frills are rare. Asked whether it bothered him, in his triumphal, pivotal senior year -- the year he was being watched by college coaches and recruiters -- to be wearing last year's scuffed old jersey, he instantly shook his head no.
"It doesn't matter what you wear -- it's how you wear it," he said.
When Kerri Lynn Piznak was in eighth grade -- on the eve of heading to Tottenville High -- she went into sports overload.
"I was doing everything," she said. "One weekend we went to Connecticut for a traveling basketball tournament, and my traveling soccer team was having a tournament there, too -- so I'd play one basketball game, go to a soccer game, then play another basketball game and go back to soccer. 'It was crazy,' everybody said, 'you'll have to decide what you're really going to do in high school.' "
At Tottenville, Kerri said, the sacrifice of narrowing the field meant focusing on her three greatest loves: basketball, soccer and cross-country.
Like Mike Martinez, she is now 17, a senior, and like him, she is being recruited by colleges around the nation -- for basketball in her case. They also seem kindred on another level. They don't let up. Whatever it is that makes Mike do his pushups is the same mysterious elixir that drives her to go the gym every Saturday morning with her father, John, with whom she has trained since she was in second grade.
Always, she said, the goal was the same: to learn how to go up and over his outstretched arm in their ritual no-holds-barred game of one-on-one. And finally, about three years ago, she found a way to do it. She has now beaten her father every Saturday morning without fail since Fathers Day 1995.
Kerri, whose schedule is jammed with school activities, awards and clubs in addition to sports, is also driven by a sense of injustice. Even at Tottenville, a school that would seem to have it all, there are imbalances and inequities, she said.
Last year, Kerri decided that the girl's basketball uniforms were shabby compared to the boys' outfits. The girls also got no warm-ups as part of their kit, and this, too, rankled. So Kerri entered an essay contest sponsored by the Women's Sports Foundation, a national research group, and won $2,500 for her school, and used just 250 words to do it.
"We've come a long way," she wrote in her essay. "But all is not yet equal."
 
Dropping the Ball
 
YESTERDAY -- How New York City high schools lost their commitment to sports, and what the costs of that failure of financing and will were across the city.

HEADLINE: The $10 Billion Man?

BYLINE: By Steven E. Landsburg; Steven E. Landsburg, a professor of economics at the University of Rochester, is the author of "Fair Play."

DATELINE: ROCHESTER

 BODY:
Legend has it that when Michael Jordan was in elementary school, a teacher advised him to study mathematics because "that's where the money is." The money turned out to be elsewhere. After accounting for Jordan's impact on everything from game attendance to Nike's sneaker sales, Fortune magazine labeled Jordan the "$10 Billion Man."
Ordinarily, when a man's activities command $10 billion in a free market, it's a safe bet that he's enriched the world economy by at least $10 billion. To behold a supremely confident Jordan soaring toward a monster dunk is surely an enriching experience. But does all that enrichment really add up to $10 billion? Let me suggest a couple of reasons to be skeptical. 
 First, the attendance figures. Every National Basketball Association team knows that attendance at home games was higher when Jordan's team, the Chicago Bulls, came to town. But there's more than one way to interpret that evidence. You could say that if it weren't for Jordan a lot of fans would have stayed home. Or that if it weren't for Jordan, a lot of fans would have gone to see other teams instead.
I have two friends who attended Knicks games only when the Bulls were visiting. Robert doesn't care much for basketball generally, but Jordan made his heart go pit-a-pat. Abby, on the other hand, would have season tickets if she could afford them. But she can't, so she stuck to the Bulls games, because Michael Jordan was her favorite. With Jordan gone, she'll go to see her next favorite team and have almost as much fun.
If most fans are like Robert, Jordan's economic contribution was as huge as his talent. If most fans are like Abby, estimates of Jordan's effect on tickets vastly overstate his value. Which theory is right? Two bits of evidence bear on that question, and they point in opposite directions. When he came into the league, attendance rose. During his first (temporary) retirement, attendance rose again.
Television revenue is equally hard to interpret. With Jordan's help, the N.B.A. gave us what many people found to be the most entertaining show on television. Entertainment has real economic value, and the league is rewarded for providing it. But is the reward a good measure of economic value? It's not as if the only alternative to basketball is C-Span; if basketball disappeared entirely, we might find something almost equally entertaining to watch. Then some television producer would get very rich, and not much economic value would be sacrificed.
As for crediting Jordan with a ten-fold increase in the value of the Bulls franchise over his career, that's mostly double-counting (the franchise value goes up because of ticket sales and television revenue, which we've already accounted for) and partly a failure to give credit where credit is due (to the providers of the Bulls' snazzy new arena).
Finally, does all that endorsement income represent true economic value? The answer depends on why endorsements are effective in the first place. One business theory is that by hiring an expensive celebrity, a company is saying: "Look, these ads are costing us a fortune. It's going to take us a long time to earn back that cost. So you can be sure our reputation matters to us, and we're not going to sell you a shoddy product."
In other words, Nike hires Jordan for the same reason law firms put expensive artwork on the walls. Admittedly, it's a theory that seems to cry out for derision. It predicts, for example, that Air Woody Allens could have been as successful as Air Jordans. But what is the alternative? Do millions of consumers believe a sneaker is somehow imbued with the spirit of their hero? That seems to be conventional wisdom, but as with much conventional wisdom, it gets harder to believe the harder you think about it.
I am forced to conclude that I have no idea why Michael Jordan sells so many sneakers, and therefore I have no idea whether he is the $10 billion man or the $1 billion man or something else altogether. Still, when it comes to his economic impact, a multitude of people will be tempted to believe that they can do the impossible: gather a few scraps of evidence, give them a dazzling spin, use them to drive a relentless argument, and jump, seemingly effortlessly, to an inevitable conclusion. It's a temptation best resisted. We can't all be Michael Jordan.

HEADLINE: Lawmakers in Both Parties Are Weighing Compromise Plans to Revamp Social Security

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 13

 BODY:
For the first time since President Clinton put Social Security's financial problems at the top of the national agenda, key members of both parties are seriously examining compromise proposals that could be acceptable both to Democrats who want to keep the retirement system intact and to Republicans pushing for a shift to private investment accounts.
The proposals center on investment accounts that would supplement Social Security rather than replace part of it. In the versions that are getting the most attention, the accounts would be voluntary but would carry incentives, in the form of matching Government contributions or tax breaks, to encourage people to save. 
 Such plans would also have to include some combination of tax increases and benefit cuts to deal with Social Security's looming financial shortfall, although some would try to solve most of the problem by allowing the Government to invest Social Security's excess cash in the stock market.
The proposals would basically leave the current Social Security system intact, in an effort to make the outcome palatable to liberals, while giving supporters of individualized investment a limited form of the private accounts they seek.
The effort to find a middle ground is at an early stage, and neither the White House nor the Republican leadership is openly supporting any particular compromise. Many of the ideas are in sketchy form.
White House officials have discussed one variant of the voluntary account approach with House Democrats, who say they are open to the idea. A moderate Democrat in the House who has worked across the aisle on a number of contentious issues, Representative Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland, says he is drafting a similar plan and has gotten encouraging responses from Republicans with whom he has consulted.
Gene Sperling, the White House economic adviser, declined to discuss details of the plans the Clinton Administration is considering. But he said today that the President would work closely with members of Congress in the next few months to develop "a strong sense of where the basis for support and ultimately bipartisan consensus can be."
Even some of the strongest backers of private investment accounts said they were open to a deal built around voluntary accounts, although they cautioned that much would depend on the details.
"The most we can hope for as reformers is a very small incremental set of changes, given the political environment we're in," said Representative Mark Sanford, a Republican from South Carolina who is an aggressive advocate of private accounts. "With that in mind, I look more favorably on the idea of tax-incentivized savings."
Senator William V. Roth Jr., the Delaware Republican who heads the Finance Committee, is pushing another approach built around individual accounts into which the Government would make contributions for the next five years, using half of the Federal budget surplus.
Under Senator Roth's approach, the accounts would not technically be part of the Social Security system. But the Senator said his plan provided "a means of moving ahead on a matter that has a direct relation to Social Security," and seemed to be similar to ideas being considered by the Administration.
"I'm hopeful that we're seeing the beginning of a consensus that could be very helpful," Mr. Roth said.
But other Republicans said they would continue to push for a fundamental overhaul of Social Security under which mandatory private accounts would be financed out of the 12.4 percent payroll tax assessed on workers and their employers.
And members of both parties said the real question was whether both sides would determine that they were better off reaching a deal on Social Security now rather than leaving the issue on the table for use as a political weapon in the 2000 elections.
Mr. Clinton has made it clear that he favors seeking higher investment returns in some way to help cover a financial gap that will leave Social Security unable to pay all beneficiaries fully, starting in 2032. So far he has deflected pressure from Republicans for a specific plan.
But his advisers have recently broached several possibilities, including one under which retirement accounts would be set up outside Social Security as a way to reassure liberal Democrats that a revamped program need not involve dismantling the guaranteed-benefit system.
Under the plan, contributions by workers would be matched by the Government in the same way that employers match contributions to 401(k) plans, and could be set up to give the greatest incentives to low and moderate income workers.
Mr. Cardin's plan would establish voluntary accounts within the Social Security system. The Government would give a tax rebate or make a direct payment into accounts to workers up to a certain income level, probably about $40,000, Mr. Cardin said.

HEADLINE: Mayor Tells Non-New Yorkers That City's Trash Is Price for What They Reap

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

 BODY:
Facing growing resistance from other states to New York City's garbage, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday that the rest of the nation was obligated to take it in return for the many cultural and financial benefits reaped from the city.
Mr. Giuliani's comments came in the wake of growing opposition in Virginia. Concerned that a major disposal company is preparing to increase its shipments of trash from New York, Gov. James S. Gilmore 3d called for limits to prevent his state from becoming "a dumping ground for East Coast garbage." 
 Mr. Giuliani, at his daily news conference yesterday, elaborated on his philosophy of waste disposal.
"New York City has a specialized problem," he said. "It comes from the fact that we're so crowded and our land mass is very small, and that brings great benefits to the rest of the country, like Virginia. People in Virginia like to utilize New York because we're a cultural center, because we're a business center. What goes along with being a cultural and a business center is you're very crowded.
"We don't have the room here to handle the garbage that's produced not just by New Yorkers," he continued, "but by the three million more people that come here that utilize the place every day. So this is a reciprocal relationship."
As a result of that relationship, the Mayor continued, the rest of the country should help the city with waste disposal. "We don't do it because we're profligate, we don't do it because we're wasteful," he said of exporting the city's trash. "We do it because there are a lot of people in the city and that brings great benefits to the American economy."
Governor Gilmore, in a text of his state of the state message last night, continued his opposition to out-of-state trash. "I believe the Commonwealth has a right -- and I would say a duty -- to ban the use of barges for the transportation of garbage on Virginia's waterways," he said.
The latest criticism arose when Waste Management Inc., a major national disposal company, recently signed a contract with a barge company that would enable up to 4,000 tons a day to be shipped to a new port in Charles City, Va., on the James River. Waste Management already transfers 2,400 tons of New York City garbage a day to Virginia and other destinations.
The criticism from Virginia came a month after the Mayor surprised and infuriated Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey with a proposal to ship residential trash to transfer stations in her state. She issued a news release with the headline, "Whitman to New York's Garbage Plan: Drop Dead" and called the plan "a direct assault on the beaches of New Jersey."
Yesterday, Mr. Giuliani dismissed such criticism as a "knee-jerk political issue" and said a "counterforce" of communities supports the garbage industry for the business and jobs it creates.
"When people move beyond just a sort of knee-jerk political issue here," he said, "there's a whole industry out there, and this will continue and it will be part of waste disposal for the next 50 or 100 years."
The Mayor raised the possibility of litigation to force other states to accept the city's waste. "They can be challenged," he said of proposed restrictions on waste export. A suit could be filed by the city or a disposal company, the Mayor said, based on the United States Constitution's provision against interfering with interstate commerce.
Although the Mayor said that the city is increasing recycling to reduce the amount of garbage, the City Council and environmental groups have accused him of thwarting that effort, including delaying the expansion of weekly pickups.
Pressure is growing on the city's garbage-disposal system as the legal deadline for closing the city's Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island at the end of 2001 approaches.

HEADLINE: TURMOIL IN BRAZIL: THE RIPPLE EFFECTS;
Argentina May Suffer Most From Neighbor's Ills

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Jan. 13

 BODY:
As shock waves from Brazil's devaluation of its currency reverberated across Latin America today, analysts said Argentina was likely to be rattled the most severely and that other countries bordering Brazil would be shaken more than Mexico, where ties to the United States economy would cushion the shock.
The news from Brazil battered all Latin American markets and several currencies today as panicked investors sold securities and rushed to buy dollars. Argentina's market index fell 10.37 percent. The Mexican peso, which floats freely, fell to a historic low, worth 9.34 American cents. 
 But analysts said that when the panic subsided, some economies in the region would prove more resilient that others.
For example, Argentina can expect to see its interest rates soar, exports drop and unemployment rise, analysts said, adding that the country, which is Brazil's closest trading partner, was likely to slide into recession. But at the other extreme, Mexico will also suffer from volatile interest rates and double-digit inflation, but with its economic fundamentals in good shape, it should eke out at least modest growth this year, despite the Brazilian crisis.
"Argentina is most vulnerable to the Brazilian crisis, and Mexico is the least," said Luis R. Luis, managing director at Scudder Kemper Investments in Boston.
Argentina's stock market drop was the worst today. In Peru, stocks fell 5.45 percent, in Brazil 5.05 percent, in Mexico 4.6 percent, in Chile 3.25 percent and in Venezuela 3.01 percent.
Tuesday's 9 percent devaluation of the Brazilian real also led to speculative pressures on other Latin currencies. Peru's sol slid 2.1 percent to a record low, worth 30.6 American cents. The Chilean peso dropped less than 1 percent. However, the Argentine peso, which is pegged at one-to-one with the dollar, did not budge, and the country's economic planning secretary, Rogelio Frigerio, vowed to defend the currency.
"One-to-one parity is not a matter for government, but a requirement and demand of the people," Mr. Frigerio told Reuters. "We are not going to change that position for anything in the world." Argentina currently appears to have the muscle to back that vow: $24 billion in reserves.
Still, the Argentine economy is headed for trouble, analysts said. They had predicted that Argentina's economy would grow 2 percent this year; now they predict zero or negative growth.
About one-third of Argentina's exports go to its huge northern neighbor, and given the revised economic forecasts, they are likely to drop sharply.
That could lead to social unrest during a presidential election year. During the regional crisis that followed Mexico's 1994 devaluation, Argentine unemployment rose to 18 percent from 12 percent, but it has since returned to 12 percent, said Luis R. Secco, an economist at Estudio Broda Consultores in Buenos Aires. Now as the Argentine economy shrinks, unemployment could easily surge to 18 percent again, he said. Argentines are to choose President Carlos Saul Menem's successor in October.
International lending to Latin America has all but stopped since Russia's default last fall started a stampede from emerging markets, and a crucial factor for Argentina will be how long it is until foreign credits begin to flow again, Mr. Secco said. Argentina has a current account deficit of 4.5 percent of its gross domestic product, and needs to borrow some $7.8 billion this year, about half of that from overseas, he said.
"Whether international credit will flow to Argentina is going to be a crucial question," Mr. Secco said.
Peru, which has an annual current account deficit of about $4 billion, will also suffer if international lenders remain nervous about Latin America.
Venezuela's public finances are even more disorderly, with a budget deficit of about 7.5 percent of gross domestic product, and its economy is largely dependent on oil revenues, which have plunged because of depressed world petroleum prices.
But President-elect Hugo Chavez, whose populist speeches last year alarmed foreign investors, has so far surprised analysts by adopting a conciliatory approach to business. Because Venezuela has little trade with Brazil and its petroleum economy tends to follow its own dynamics, the outlook is unsettled, but the country is not likely to suffer greatly from Brazil's devaluation, analysts said.
In Mexico, President Ernesto Zedillo's economic team has for months been preparing carefully for a potential devaluation in Brazil, and its economy shows few signs of vulnerability.
Mexico's central bank auctioned $200 million today to slow the peso's depreciation and tightened the money supply by 30 million pesos, about $3 million.
Interest rates rose in reaction to the Brazilian devaluation, but they remained far below the chaotic 50 percent rates reached during the emerging markets crisis last September.
"Mexico's economic program is designed to reduce the vulnerability of our economy to these sorts of foreign financial shocks," the central bank said in a statement today. Independent analysts agreed.
"In the sea of bad news, Mexico doesn't have much to fear because nobody's tried to protect anything that shouldn't be protected," said Rogelio Ramirez de la O, an economic consultant here. "They cut the budget, let the exchange rate take its knocks and interest rates rise. So our picture is better than what the Brazilians or the Argentines are looking at now."

HEADLINE: Project for Minorities Aims to Show Its Broader Mandate

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES 

 BODY:
Senior executives from several dozen blue-chip corporations will gather in New York today with hundreds of their counterparts at minority-owned companies for the second annual economic conference organized by the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson's advocacy initiative, the Wall Street Project.
Like last year's event, the two-day conference has a high-kilowatt guest list that includes C. Michael Armstrong, chairman of AT&T, and Sanford I. Weill, the co-chief executive of Citigroup -- and, by the way, President Clinton, three Cabinet members and other officials. 
 Once again, Mr. Jackson will use the occasion to exhort corporate America to expand its "trade relationships" with the "emerging markets" in inner cities and rural backwaters, through employment, capital investment and the purchase of goods and services.
But this year, Mr. Jackson will also be trying to demonstrate persuasively that the Wall Street Project is operating with a broader mandate and a clearer focus than it demonstrated at its debut conference last year.
Despite its name, the project is aimed at expanding opportunities for women and minorities all across corporate America, not just on Wall Street. "The term 'Wall Street' is simply symbolic of the entire finance and business culture," Mr. Jackson said in a recent interview.
When he met with local groups over the last year, he said, he frequently asked them to name five top political leaders, and "they all could.
"Then I asked them to name five top corporate C.E.O.'s, and there was dead silence," he continued. "We've got to change that."
The Wall Street Project still has much of the fervor and facets of a grass-roots political organization. It relies heavily on its founder's charisma and access to top executives. And while Mr. Jackson says he prefers private negotiations, in the last year he has also led marches, visited picket lines and attended rallies -- proving that the fledgling project is, at the very least, a bully pulpit for the economic agenda that he has promoted through his Rainbow/ PUSH Coalition for many years.
And, like the grass-roots civil rights movement that first brought Mr. Jackson to prominence as a top aide to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., the Wall Street project is emerging as a first-class networking arena for minority business leaders, introducing them not only to mainstream executives like Mr. Weill at Citigroup but also to one another.
Emma C. Chappell, the founder and chairman of the United Bank of Philadelphia, cites her encounter with Vernon Duckrey, who owns more than 100 Burger King and Pizza Hut franchises in southern New Jersey. The two black entrepreneurs have built their businesses a short distance away from each other, "But I had no idea he existed until the Wall Street Project referred him to me," Ms. Chappell said. "Now we are getting ready to finance some of his new construction, and I've got a good new customer."
A new element added to the project's grass-roots format, Mr. Jackson said, is shareholder activism. The project has purchased stock in 107 American corporations, and it intends to be an active shareholder. Mr. Jackson has attended annual meetings to urge corporations to resolve existing disputes with minority employees and to expand the business they do with minority-owned suppliers, professionals and banks.
"This has always been part of Jesse Jackson's broader rhetorical agenda, but now they're putting it into action," said Timothy H. Smith, the director of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility in New York. "I don't think any company could ignore him. He can jawbone or encourage or praise -- and he also has the ability to launch a major campaign against you if you don't respond."
The Wall Street Project already claims some successes. Several companies have added minority directors to their boards at the group's urging, and others, like the Boeing Company, have begun to resolve longstanding employee disputes after Mr. Jackson intervened.
The project persuaded the General Motors Corporation to undertake a yearlong independent review of its minority dealer development program. That review resulted in a blueprint to improve the program, which is now being carried out. The project also encouraged MCI Worldcom Inc. and six other companies to include minority-owned banks in their securities sales last year.
Mr. Jackson's effort has emboldened some minority business leaders to promote his agenda. In one example, analysts from Ariel Capital Management, a black-controlled mutual fund and money-management company in Chicago, now routinely ask executives about the diversity of their boards and senior management, said John W. Rogers Jr., Ariel's president. "The Wall Street Project has made it easier to ask the question," he added. "And it is a great way to see whether top management at a corporation gets it."
The project's leaders have lobbied for improvements in Federal Communications Commission rules about minority ownership of media outlets and Small Business Administration programs aimed at financing less affluent entrepreneurs. And it has pushed for new public-private programs to steer capital to the inner cities and Appalachia.
But in a departure from both traditional shareholder activism and grass-roots political work, the Wall Street project has as much to say to its supporters as it does to its adversaries. And its message, Mr. Jackson says, is that "casting a ballot to vote is not enough."
"We have to cast our proxy, too," he said. "We have to exercise our power as investors."
At least 30 corporations are helping to sponsor this year's conference events, up from barely a dozen last year. And while last year's sponsors were largely from the financial-services industry, this year's sponsors include Boeing, the Frito-Lay subsidiary of Pepsico, the Xerox Corporation and the Stop and Shop supermarket unit of Royal Ahold N.V.
The Wall Street Project is a program of the Citizenship Education Fund, an Ohio-chartered charitable foundation that Mr. Jackson formed 15 years ago. The fund has supported the project during its embryonic stages and monitors its finances, said Janice Mathis, an officer of the fund and general counsel of the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition in Chicago.
But most of the project's 1998 revenues consisted of the approximately $400,000 raised at last year's conference, Ms. Mathis said, and its 1999 budget relies heavily on tonight's benefit, at which the poet Maya Angelou and President Clinton will be the guests of honor.
The project's main office is in New York. Each of its new regional outposts -- in Chicago, Detroit and Los Angeles -- is expected to be self-sustaining through local fund-raising, Ms. Mathis said. These offices, in most cases, are built around "trade bureaus," the local minority business clubs that have been run for years by the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition. Trade bureau members contribute a minimum of $250 to join; their dues now entitle them to receive the Wall Street Project's monthly newsletter, which says it has 3,500 subscribers.
The Wall Street Project will be constantly tempted to expand beyond its shoestring budget simply because the needs are so great, said Chee Chee Williams, who directs the New York office. And Mr. Jackson has often been criticized for spreading himself too thin and not following through on his ambitious agenda.
But his supporters do not seem worried. "I don't think we should expect him to do the follow-through," said Ms. Chappell, the Philadelphia banker. "It is up to all of us to do that."

HEADLINE: Dueling M.I.T. Economists Testify at Micro soft Trial

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY and STEVE LOHR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 13

 BODY:
In the Microsoft trial today, a Justice Department lawyer opened cross-examination of the company's first witness by asking him to concede that Microsoft held a monopoly in personal-computer operating systems.
But although the witness, Richard L. Schmalensee, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, had submitted 328 pages of written testimony addressing every aspect of the Government's antitrust case, he said he had never studied the market for personal-computer operating systems, because "I didn't see any particular purpose in investigating that question." 
 Three months after the trial opened, Microsoft finished questioning the Government's final witness, Franklin M. Fisher, another M.I.T economist. With that, David Boies, the Government's lead trial lawyer, rested his case -- but not before entering into evidence a raft of new documents and depositions.
One of those was an internal E-mail in which an executive of the Walt Disney Company said, referring to contract restrictions imposed by Microsoft, "We are being roughed up by the 1,000-pound gorilla of the industry."
But Mr. Schmalensee depicted Microsoft today as a company striving to hold onto a fragile lock on the market, at one point even suggesting that the operating system used in the Palm Pilot personal organizer posed a serious potential threat to Microsoft's Windows.
That prompted incredulity from Mr. Boies, leading Mr. Schmalensee to say: "Is it a significant competitor today? No. But it is a germ of a potential competitor."
Mr. Schmalensee has served as a paid consultant and expert witness for Microsoft since 1992, leading Mr. Boies to suggest that he was Microsoft's "house economist." Mr. Boies offered excerpts from Mr. Schmalensee's testimony in a previous case as evidence, attempting to show that Mr. Schmalensee offered whatever position best served the case at hand.
Testifying last fall in a suit in which Bristol Technology, a software company based in Danbury, Conn., was trying to establish that it competed with Microsoft, Mr. Schmalensee had said: "In that view of the world, essentially everybody that is writing software is competing with everybody else. And I just don't think that's useful."
That apparent contradiction stirred Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson to tell the witness, "What I'm trying to determine here is whether what you say here is consistent with what you said in that case."
Mr. Schmalensee said it was consistent because the issues were different. Bristol, he said, made a program for software programmers that did not compete with Windows.
But Mr. Schmalensee listed two small niche operating systems that he argued posed a threat to Microsoft: Linux and Be-OS.
"I think these are important not because they are a competitive threat today, but because they show that entering the operating system market is possible," he said. "And there will be others."
The judge then asked him if the tiny companies that make these systems were making any money.
"I would be stunned if they were making any serious money," Mr. Schmalensee responded.
In his written testimony, Mr. Schmalensee said: "A firm with monopoly power over the operating system would charge at least 16 times over what Microsoft charges."
Under that formula, Microsoft would charge computer makers about $800 for each copy of Windows -- the price of entire computers systems with Windows today.
In the final minutes of the Government's case, Mr. Fisher, who used to be Mr. Schmalensee's teacher, offered a long list of ways he said Microsoft's behavior had harmed consumers -- a key element of any antitrust case.
Prices for computer hardware and software have grown more than they otherwise would have, he said, and innovation has been stifled.
With the documents introduced today, the Government tried to bolster key themes of its case: that Microsoft viewed the Internet as a threat to its dominance, that it used its operating-system monopoly to bully personal computer makers and others, and that it bundled its browser with Windows to stifle competition.
Microsoft said the documents had been chosen to embarrass it but instead depicted a vigorous competitor striving to improve its products.
In an E-mail to company executives on April 10, 1995, William H. Gates, Microsoft's chairman, wrote, "We are looking at the Internet destroying our position as the setter of standards," adding that it was "taking away our power every day."
The Government says Microsoft merged its Internet Explorer browser with its Windows operating system to assure universal distribution and thwart competition in Internet software. To support that charge, the Government released a March 1997 E-mail in which a Microsoft executive wrote that the "only real chance Internet Explorer has of getting them to switch" from Netscape came when users upgraded a Windows operating system, purchased a new personal computer loaded with Microsoft's browser or signed up with an Internet service provider that promoted Internet Explorer.

HEADLINE: TURMOIL IN BRAZIL: THE MISTAKES -- Economic Scene;
Brazil Swallows Another Bitter Pill

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN 

 BODY:
Brazil's surprise devaluation was anything but surprising.
That is not Monday morning quarterbacking. Devaluation has been the prediction of many economists even after the International Monetary Fund, backed by the Clinton Administration, provided a $40 billion credit line several months ago that Brazil was to use to defend the value of its currency as well as help it plug a huge hole in its federal deficit. 
 The problem with the I.M.F. bailout, independent economists argued repeatedly, was that it allowed Brazil to cling to an overvalued exchange rate -- by some estimates, 30 percent above sustainable levels. At the same time, its policy became increasingly dependent on short-term loans. That combination -- overvalued currency and huge short-term loans -- said Jeffrey Sachs of the Harvard Institute for International Development, "is anywhere and everywhere an invitation for financial chaos."
But now that Brazil has devalued, what happens next? One possibility is that limited devaluation works. Investors may decide that the currency will remain stable hereafter and that Brazil will stick close to its commitments to close its budget deficit. If that happens, domestic interest rates could fall and Brazil could begin to recover.
More likely, limited devaluation will need to be backed by stiff interest rate increases to persuade lenders to stay put. Indeed, the new president of the central bank seemed to anticipate that possibility yesterday when he vowed to use Brazil's billions of dollars in reserves to intervene in the markets. He also suggested he might "raise interest rates to defend our foreign exchange regime."
If that happens, the economy could go into a tailspin. The immediate victims would, of course, be Brazilian workers and their families. But nearby trading partners, especially Argentina, would be hit hard as they lose Brazil's large export market.
The problem with an overvalued currency is that it makes imports cheap and exports dear, leading to a drain on the country's dollar reserves. At some point lenders grow fearful that the country will run out of dollars. They cash in their loans before someone else lays claim to the dwindling dollars, forcing the country to squander the rest of its reserves defending its exchange rate.
Countries can postpone the inevitable by jacking up interest rates to sky-high levels -- over 30 percent in Brazil's case -- to attract new loans. But high interest rates throw the economy into recession, sapping political support. Eventually, the country chooses to stop defending the currency, which, after the dust settles on foreign exchange markets, can allow it to cut its interest rates.
An overvalued currency and large short-term debt buried the Mexican currency in 1995, the currencies of Thailand, Indonesia, Korea and Russia last year. Now comes Brazil.
"Misaligned currencies cannot be defended by high interest rates," Rudiger Dornbusch, a leading international economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said yesterday. He said the same thing in October.
The devaluation was predictable, Mr. Sachs said yesterday, echoing statements he made in October. "Falsely pegged currencies -- currency pegs that lack political and economic commitment -- cannot last," Gary Hufbauer of the Institute for International Economics said yesterday. He made the same prediction last year.
So if economists could see disaster coming, why couldn't Brazil? In part, its obstinacy can be traced to President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who as Finance Minister gained credit earlier in the decade stamping out Brazil's hyperinflation by tying its currency rigidly to the dollar. In effect, Mr. Cardoso solved Brazil's inflation problem by turning control of its money supply over to the United States.
But his monetary crackdown produced a sharp recession, which Mr. Cardosa has no stomach for repeating. For him, severing his currency's tie to the dollar invites a return to an undisciplined past. Mr. Sachs suggests that the pegged rate was a terrific way to handle a financial emergency, but Mr. Cardoso stuck with the rigid policy way too long.
Buttressing Mr. Cardoso's recent resolve was pressure from the international financial community to take a hard stand against devaluation. The wave of devaluations that started in Asia last year spread quickly to Russia and threatened Latin America. Brazil emerged as the place where monetary authorities vowed to stanch the contagion.
But the I.M.F.-backed package was never credible, economists say. Had it been fully adopted, it would have crushed the economy. For that reason it was never embraced by Brazil's politicians. The Parliament rejected some of the budget cutbacks. This week one of the state governments defaulted on its debt. Both events eroded investor confidence, driving some to flee. One day earlier this week, Brazil lost close to a billion dollars of reserves.
Something had to give. Yesterday, Brazil undertook a limited devaluation of about 8 percent. The idea was to ease investors' fears of a larger devaluation, thereby taking some pressure off its currency. The fallout in Brazil and around the world depends heavily on what policy options are followed.
The difficulty with Brazil's current plan is that limited devaluation may not hold even if bolstered with large interest rate rises. Mexico tried the policy in 1994, but investors fled and forced the country within a few days to let its currency float free.
If, as many economists predict, Brazil follows Mexico's lead, the economic fallout is hard to predict. For starters, Brazil has incurred large dollar denominated debt. A devaluation raises the cost of debt repayment, putting additional pressure on an already bloated fiscal deficit. "Devaluation could do Brazil more harm than good," Mr. Dornbusch says. And there is the additional risk that devaluation in Brazil will scare investors throughout Latin America and beyond, leading to successive rounds of devaluation and economic free fall in Colombia, Hong Kong, even China. Jittery investors might even exit the American stock market that many believe is overpriced.
But what can the I.M.F. and the United States do? Prof. Richard Cooper of Harvard suggests that this question -- the obvious one to policy makers in Washington -- is the wrong question. He says that Brazil's problems are overwhelmingly domestic -- its fiscal deficit is ominously large -- and that problems with its exchange rate are secondary. Last year's I.M.F.-backed package is about all the international world can do. The rest is up to the Brazilians.
Mr. Sachs thinks the correct answer is for Brazil to float the currency. Freed from the need to defend its currency, Brazil's crushing interest rates could return to normal. He would use money from the I.M.F., along with credit from international banks, to smooth the transition, reassuring investors that there will be no default and the currency would be worth holding.
Mr. Dornbusch says the answer to Brazil's problems, as well as those of many emerging economies, is a currency board. A limited devaluation would maintain the same policy that has produced stagnant per capita income for two decades. A floating currency is no answer because of the problem of dollar-denominated loans. But a currency board, like that adopted by Argentina, would tie the value of Brazil's currency to the dollar, but in a way that largely removes the option of devaluation. That is the best guarantee that the dollar link is permanent. The hope is that confident investors will flock to Brazil, push down its interest rates and jump-start growth.
Economists agree on one issue: More than ever, help from the I.M.F. is crucial. Devaluation raises the cost of imports and could spook investors. Fiscal cuts will depress economic activity. For all these reasons, Brazil could use an injection of cash, assuming it adopts prudent monetary and budget policies.
Mr. Sachs adds that Brazil is the latest in a series of countries whose economies collapsed under I.M.F. programs. "After matters settle down," he said, "we need to take a serious look at fundamentally changing that institution."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Wall Street Recoils From Brazil's Turmoil, Then Collects Itself

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
Stock markets around the world shuddered yesterday in response to another dose of emerging-market turmoil.
Brazil's plan to effectively devalue its currency initially deflated the confidence of stock investors in the United States and abroad. But after a sharp selloff in the first half-hour of trading, American stocks rebounded steadily through the day. 
 As the morning light seeped into the canyons of Wall Street, indications were that stocks would take a huge hit. Some analysts said that the Dow Jones industrial average might lose as many as 400 points.
In early trading, the prices of financial futures dropped as far as regulators allowed, and when equity trading started at 9:30 A.M., the bleak forecasts seemed on the mark. The Dow plunged more than 250 points, or nearly 3 percent, in the first 30 minutes, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 115 points, almost 5 percent.
Then, as quickly as it came, the calamity passed; the panic seemed to evaporate as stocks collectively began to reverse course and recover. Recalling that previous plunges spurred by currency crises -- in Asia in 1997 and in Russia last summer -- proved to be buying opportunities in United States stocks, investors dived in.
"Once again, the mentality is to buy the dips," said Byron Wien, chief United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "When it looked like this was not the beginning of a bear market, people saw that Yahoo was down 70 points and decided to take advantage of it."
The Dow finished the session down 125.12 points, or 1.3 percent, at 9,349.56. Other American gauges posted smaller losses; at one point, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was even up more than 8 points. It finished down 5.11 points at 1,234.40.
"I think U.S. investors saw Brazil's actions as inevitable, and now that it's behind us we can move forward," Mr. Wien said. "Markets have a funny way of reacting positively to reality once they think it through."
Foreign markets did not fare as well. European markets fell sharply as Brazil disclosed its plan to loosen the trading range for its currency, the real; they were closed by the time the Brazilian Congress adopted reform measures that to American investors looked promising.
Investors in the United States shunned shares of auto makers, heavy-equipment companies and banks with business links to Brazil. But they snapped up stocks like Intel, Microsoft and Sun Microsystems, whose earnings are not expected to be disrupted.
Yahoo, which ended the day down 34 a share at 368, has no operations in Brazil, but the stocks of companies that do finished mostly lower yesterday. Shares of Ford Motor, General Motors and DaimlerChrysler each fell 2 percent or more, while those of Caterpillar, the equipment maker, International Paper and Coca-Cola also fell.
Banking stocks suffered even more, as investors recalled that the last Latin American debt crisis caused nagging problems for money-center banks. J. P. Morgan's shares fell almost 5 percent, Citigroup's declined 6 percent and those of American Express slumped nearly 4 percent.
Over all, investment analysts and portfolio managers said that while they expect neither an extended nor a deep downturn from Brazil's crisis, much uncertainty remains about that country's fiscal plans.
"I think this is not the last adjustment that we will see to the currency regime in Brazil," said Thomas Haslett, chief investment officer for emerging market equities at Putnam Investments, the mutual fund company. He noted, though, that foreign companies doing business there have had plenty of warning to hedge against a currency decline.
Less certain is the effect that Brazil's problems will have on other markets in Latin America, Europe and the Far East. Stocks in those regions fell sharply yesterday, though they could stabilize today following the rebound in the United States.
Brazil's Bovespa stock-market index fell 5 percent, with shares of the 12 companies created by the breakup of Telebras, the giant telecommunications concern, among the market's biggest losers. Four of the largest Telebras spinoffs operate with pricing discretion that could offer them some protection from the inflation that is now expected to rise in Brazil.
Mexico's Bolsa index fell 4.6 percent, and the Argentina general index tumbled 10 percent. Investors are likely to watch those countries -- two of the region's other big economies -- closely for signs of weakness.
"Because of the uncertainty, Latin America is going to have a higher cost of capital," Mr. Haslett said. "A relatively small amount of support should be able to carry Argentina through 1999." And Mexico should benefit from a continued strong economy in the United States.
In Europe, stock prices fell sharply, 3 percent in Britain and 4 percent in Germany. The region's economy has already suffered from slowing exports to Asia and Eastern Europe, and could feel a further pinch from Brazil's trouble. Volkswagen A.G., for example, is among the biggest car producers in Brazil. Spanish banks have also lent heavily in Brazil, which led investors to push Spanish stocks down nearly 7 percent.
Stocks also fell in Asia, but those losses came well before Brazil announced its currency plans. Stocks in Hong Kong fell 4 percent yesterday, while Tokyo ended slightly higher.
Unlike the Asian currency crisis of 1997 or last year's economic emergency in Russia, the situation in Brazil carries more immediate impact for investors in the United States. Brazil dominates the economies of South America, accounting for 40 percent of the continent's output. And investors can watch any effects of the crisis unfold in real time.
Since Asia's currency crisis began in the summer of 1997, analysts have suggested that Brazil -- which, like Thailand, Indonesia and other emerging-market nations, had pegged the value of its currency to the American dollar -- might come under pressure to devalue the real.
That concern was tempered somewhat when the International Monetary Fund assembled a $41 billion "precautionary" loan package in November. The I.M.F. has been criticized for responding too slowly in Asia and for attaching overly harsh conditions to its loans there.
Now Brazil could benefit from what has been learned elsewhere. "There is a very strong possibility that this will be one of the turning points," said David Herro, manager of the Oakmark International fund, a $800 million fund with about 9 percent of its assets invested in Brazil.
Mr. Herro also dismissed parallels between Brazil's woes and last year's turmoil in Russia.
"Brazil is free-market oriented and is run by some smart people," Mr. Herro said. "And unlike Mexico's crisis in 1994, Brazil has no problem with short-term debt or its currency reserves."
Judging by the reaction of American investors, the crisis in Brazil appeared over almost before it started. Some stocks rose from the opening bell: Ascend Communications gained 5 3/8, to 80 5/16, after Lucent Technologies agreed to buy it for about $19.7 billion in stock.
Shares of Intel fell at the opening even though the company reported fourth-quarter earnings late Tuesday that beat analyst estimates. Investors soon decided that the drop was unwarranted and sent the shares up 3 7/16, to 139.
Investors bid up several other technology stocks as well. Sun Microsystems gained 3 7/16, to 96 13/16, and traded as high as 104 1/2. Microsoft, which started its defense in the Federal antitrust trial after losing a bid to get the charges dismissed, rose 1 5/8, to 143 13/16.

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
In a Year of Acrimony, Giuliani Is Defined by the Economy

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani formally began the first year of his second administration last January with a State of the City speech that chronicled past accomplishments and made bold promises of more to come. He urged the people of New York City to take personal responsibility for this moment in time, and implicitly presented himself as the person to lead the metropolis to continued greatness.
But he ended the year in a manner decidedly less grand: threatening to place a homeless shelter in the district of a Brooklyn City Council member whose legislation on homelessness he found offensive. Whatever substantive problems he had with the legislation were largely overshadowed by his mano a mano approach. 
 Those two moments serve as appropriate bookends to a year that often reflected the essence of Giuliani the Mayor and Giuliani the man. Now, with the Mayor poised to deliver another State of the City Message today, political scientists and others who monitor city government are struggling to get beyond the mayoral hyperbole to assess the success of Mr. Giuliani's agenda last year.
In the end, they say, Mr. Giuliani may have stumbled on some matters and caused distraction with his tendency to marry assertiveness with nastiness. There is also a sense that his second term is relying heavily on the successes of the first. But in the end, they say, he succeeded -- some say by default -- on the big-ticket issues of crime and the economy.
"The criteria by which Rudy is judged is not whether he wins or loses his battles," said Mitchell L. Moss, the director of the Taub Urban Research Center at New York University. "The longterm impact is that the homicide rate continues to be low. And he continues to benefit from a terrific economy."
Fred Siegel, a political scientist at Cooper Union in New York, said that the Mayor was "milking the bull of already achieved successes."
"It wasn't a year where any new agenda was laid out," Mr. Siegel said. "But job growth continues, inflation stays low, crime keeps dropping. The bottom line is when you talk to people they say that New York City is well-run, prosperous, and they're not feeling any pain right now. The problems to come are around the bend."
Still, the course of city politics last year also demonstrates that the Mayor does not always win. For example, last year the Mayor praised the City Council and its Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, for the cooperative atmosphere permeating City Hall. A few months later, the two leaders were battling over the fate of Yankee Stadium, with the Mayor proposing a plan for a stadium in Manhattan and the Speaker insisting that the team remain in the Bronx. That dispute consumed the city's budget process; it ended with the Council passing its own $34 billion budget and the Mayor quietly setting aside, at least for now, his vision of a Manhattan stadium.
Nor could the Mayor have predicted that the one labor leader he praised -- Stanley Hill, the president of District Council 37, the largest municipal union -- would be removed from office while various corruption investigations centered on a fixed union vote in 1996 on a contract that was favorable to the Giuliani administration.
For whatever reasons, the Mayor did not achieve some of the goals he laid out in last year's state-of-the-city speech. He talked about addressing domestic violence; incidents of domestic violence increased. He said that he wanted to unseal the records of juvenile offenders; that went nowhere. He talked about extending the school year and ending principal tenure; those ambitious goals were not realized.
But he had some successes. He spoke out against remedial education in the four-year colleges of the City University of New York, prompting a movement in that direction. Against strong opposition, he managed to have the police assume responsibility for security in the city's school system. He also followed through on a promise to dedicate funds to drug enforcement and drug treatment.
Myron Magnet, the editor of City Journal -- a magazine published by the generally conservative Manhattan Institute -- said that he thought Mr. Giuliani had done very well in 1998. He pointed in particular to the Mayor's success in reducing the welfare rolls by as many as 400,000 people, and in emphasizing the value of workfare.
"That's remarkable," Mr. Magnet said. "One of things that Giuliani has demonstrated is that things that seem impossible -- reducing crime significantly in New York -- can happen overnight if you have the will to do it."
The Public Advocate, Mark Green, for whom Mr. Giuliani rarely hides his disdain, said that the Mayor deserved a lot of credit for the crime reduction, the tourism boom and some of the job growth. But he predicted that today's State of the City speech would probably be a "Panglossian analysis of good news about 1998," leaving unmentioned more troubling matters.
Among them, he said, were the Mayor's failed efforts to undermine watchdog agencies like the Citizens Budget Commission and the Independent Budget Office, his unsuccessful attempt to curtail the number of street vendors, and the Federal inquiries into allegations of police brutality and unlawful delay in access to Medicaid and food stamps to the eligible poor.
Mr. Green also touched on Mr. Giuliani's management style. "In 1998 the Mayor had a relatively small-bore agenda," he said, "based largely on the thesis of: be civil or I'll put a homeless shelter in your district."
Mr. Giuliani recently indicated that he recognized what is remembered in the long run about any mayor. "If my city doesn't work, I don't like the Mayor," he said. "It doesn't matter if I like him or don't like him, I don't want him as the Mayor. If my city is getting better, and my life is getting better, and my children's lives are getting better, then I don't really care whether I like the Mayor or don't like the Mayor. He's a good mayor."

HEADLINE: Port Authority Offers Its Vision of New York Harbor

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey outlined a 40-year blueprint for New York Harbor yesterday, including spending at least $500 million to improve derelict piers and warehouses along the Brooklyn waterfront.
The 40-year plan, the first of its kind for the harbor, urges committing $1 billion to dredge the harbor's 19th-century shipping channels, which are too shallow to accommodate the huge cargo ships that are quickly becoming standard equipment for international shipping companies. Other ports in Halifax, Nova Scotia; Norfolk, Va., and Long Beach, Calif., are already being deepened, threatening an exodus of business from New York's ports. 
 The Port Authority's plan is merely a planning blueprint: each element would have to be approved by the authority's board, as would the method of financing. The approval process is traditionally difficult, often infused with political tension.
Such tension was immediately apparent yesterday when Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who has often complained that the Port Authority favors New Jersey over New York in areas like its subsidies of the New Jersey Path system and improvements to Newark International Airport, said the harbor plan reflected similarly unequal treatment.
The Mayor's aides said he also planned to use his State of the City Address today to renew his call for eliminating the Port Authority. And Mr. Giuliani said he would propose awarding contracts for new operators to take over Kennedy International Airport and La Guardia Airport when the Port Authority leases on them expire in 2015. The airports are on city-owned property.
But in a lift for the Port Authority's shopping list for New York Harbor, Vice President Al Gore announced yesterday that the Federal Government had agreed to pay 75 percent of the costs of a five-year dredging project in which the Kill Van Kull and Newark Bay Channel, both feeding the major port terminals of Newark and Elizabeth, would be dredged to 45 feet from their current depth of 40 feet by the end of 2004.
"This port is a major economic engine for the region, so of course we are going to fight for it," Mr. Gore said at a cavernous warehouse in Port Elizabeth, confirming weeks of speculation that the Federal Government would contribute $550 million toward the dredging. The remaining $183 million of the $733 million project is to be paid by the Port Authority.
The Port Authority's 40-year blueprint goes beyond dredging the port's shallow channels and includes upgrading and expanding warehouses, roads and shipping equipment at the harbor's main terminals, which are now clustered mainly along the industrial waterfronts of Staten Island, Newark, Elizabeth and Bayonne.
Under the plan, up to $6 billion would be spent through the year 2040 on the terminals, with $500 million being spent on the nearly idle docks stretching from Sunset Park to Bay Ridge in Brooklyn.
Such plans would require approval of the Governors of New York and New Jersey. Both have often complained that their respective states are shortchanged by the Port Authority. The financing for the long-term improvements would also require raising huge amounts of money, through the Port Authority's powers to issue bonds. Officials said that bond sales could be supplemented by investments from private shipping companies.
The obstacles facing the plan were highlighted by the comments yesterday by Mayor Giuliani, who questioned elements of the plan even before the Port Authority's full report was released. "What they are doing is moving the entire port to New Jersey and taking it away from New York," the Mayor said yesterday.
The Mayor's own plan calls for Brooklyn to obtain more shipping business through the construction of a new rail tunnel under the harbor.
That plan, with its costs estimated at $1 billion to $5 billion, would fill New York City's historic void of having no direct freight rail link to the rest of the nation. It also envisions improvements to roads and the construction of new rail lines in Brooklyn.
Although Port Authority officials said yesterday that their plan for the Brooklyn waterfront had taken the city's hopes for a tunnel into account -- an initial $500 million investment in the Brooklyn piers would lead to far greater improvements if the rail tunnel were built, they contend -- the 40-year blueprint did not designate any of agency's own money to help build the tunnel.
Another complaint of city officials yesterday was that the Port Authority plan called for spending $650 million for rebuilding the Military Ocean Terminal in Bayonne, a shipping hub abandoned by the Army in 1997. That project, which would be finished in 2005, would be completed a year before the agency is to complete work on the New York City terminal property in Howland Hook on Staten Island, and three years before it envisions work being completed on the South Brooklyn waterfront.
"By giving only lip service to Mayor Giuliani's proposal for a rail freight tunnel, the Port Authority is hedging its commitment," said Charles Millard, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation. He said the 40-year plan "continues the historical bias favoring New Jersey over New York."
Nor was Mr. Gore's announcement of money for harbor dredging greeted with unalloyed cheer at City Hall, where Mr. Millard said it provided another example of New Jersey favoritism because it provided money to dredge the main channel leading to shipping terminals in Newark and Elizabeth, and not in the channel leading to Staten Island.
But some experts said yesterday that the complaints from City Hall clouded a proposal that was in many ways more generous to New York City's waterfront than previous development plans for the harbor.
"The Port Authority is trying to look at what is realistic for their entire set of facilities, and the city should be pleased," said Mitchell Moss, an economist and urban planner at New York University who has been a critic of the rail tunnel idea.
"The Port Authority appears to be making a serious effort in South Brooklyn without going into the never-never land of rail tunnels," he said.

Lucent Deal for Ascend Comes With Little Fanfare
In announcing its $20 billion acquisition of Ascend Communications, Lucent Technologies called it the "largest technology merger ever" and "a leap rather than a step," but there was an unmistakable whiff of ho-hum in the air.
The high-technology marriage is a stock swap of 0.825 share of Lucent for each share of Ascend, a 19 percent premium over Ascend's market value when trading ended on Tuesday. The deal would have been dramatic had it occurred a year ago, but by the time it was done it seemed inevitable and perhaps even overdue to many analysts and customers. Page C2. 

2d Year for Wall Street Project
Senior executives from several dozen blue-chip corporations will gather in New York today with hundreds of their counterparts at minority-owned companies for the second annual economic conference organized by the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson's advocacy initiative, the Wall Street Project. Mr. Jackson will use the occasion to exhort corporate America to expand its "trade relationships" with the "emerging markets" in inner cities and rural backwaters, but he will also be trying to demonstrate that the Wall Street Project is operating with a broader mandate and a clearer focus than it demonstrated at its debut conference last year.

The Government's lead trial lawyer in its case against Microsoft, David Boies, rested his case. Cross-examining the company's first witness, the M.I.T. economist Richard L. Schmalensee, he was unable to get him to agree that Microsoft holds a monopoly in personal-computer operating systems. C2.
 
Profits Fall at Big Retailers
Profits after taxes at large United States retailers averaged 1.9 cents for every dollar of sales during the third quarter, down from the 2.3 cents in the second quarter and 2 cents in the third quarter of 1997, the Commerce Department said. It was the lowest level in more than a year. C2.
 
Bell Atlantic in Internet Deal
In a move to compete with high-speed cable-modem services, America Online and Bell Atlantic announced a joint effort to sell high-speed Internet access to America Online's customers.

HEADLINE: TURMOIL IN BRAZIL: THE U.S. ROLE;
As an Economy Sinks, U.S. Sees Painful Choices

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 13

 BODY:
When President Clinton and Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin announced two months ago what they termed a "precautionary" $41.5 billion aid package for Brazil, they described it as the first test of a new strategy to help countries reform their economies before being overwhelmed by the tumultuous global market forces that have swept from Asia to Russia to Latin America.
In return, the Brazilians said they would curb free-spending ways -- they signed an accord declaring that their Government was "fully committed" to maintaining the system for managing the value of its currency. Only by slowly decreasing the value of the real, the thinking went, could Brazil keep itself and the rest of Latin America from descending into a nasty recession. 
 But now, after watching billions continue to pour out of the country after their legislature balked at many of the toughest changes, the Brazilians have allowed their currency to fall more than 8 percent.
Many suspect it is the first of a series of devaluations that could resonate around the Americas, and perhaps around the world. And it confronts Mr. Clinton, Mr. Rubin and the International Monetary Fund with a painful choice: whether to continue pumping aid into a country that seems reluctant to change, or whether to stand back, even if that means risking a reignition of the economic turmoil that followed Russia's economic crisis last summer.
In statements today, neither Mr. Clinton nor Mr. Rubin tipped his hand -- or promised much more help. "It is important that Brazil carry forward the implementation of a strong, credible economic program," Mr. Rubin said in a statement. In private, other Administration officials predicted that Brazil's problems would not trigger another selloff around the world, the way panicked investors and lenders fled from developing nations five months ago. The world economy is less brittle now, they said, and investors are a lot better prepared and more savvy than they were five months ago.
But the reality, one senior Administration official said this afternoon, is that "none of us really know."
"It's a breach of the fire wall that we spent months building around Brazil," said another official, one of the President's top economic advisers. "It's hard to overestimate the anger around here about how the Brazilians wasted time when they needed to deal with their problems."
The fire wall was the $41.5 billion "precautionary" aid program for Brazil, a figure that included a $5 billion direct contribution from the United States. The idea was to buy some time for the Brazilians, to enable Brazil to keep its economy together, and its currency strong, while the Government implemented a detailed economic plan negotiated with the I.M.F.
But from the start, the Administration knew that it was also building a fire wall for itself. Brazil is one of America's largest trading partners, a far larger market for American corporations than any Asian nation except Japan. A deep recession there, it was feared, could trigger big trouble in Argentina and Mexico, and it would be felt in the United States far more sharply than last year's crisis in Southeast Asia, where American firms are less exposed.
For Mr. Clinton and Mr. Rubin, the fire wall was also the first test of a new strategy for coping with global economic instability.
Their idea was to aid countries before they got into deep trouble, the kind of trouble that wreaked havoc on the economies of South Korea, Indonesia, Thailand and Russia. "It is far better to help a country when it is still fundamentally healthy," Mr. Rubin said last fall, "and when it is easier to make the necessary economic reforms."
But the strategy hinged on the willingness of Brazil's unpredictable legislature to enact that reform program -- including sharp and politically unpopular budget cuts that began to strip away many of the government-provided benefits that Brazilians had come to expect, but which their country could no longer afford.
The legislature balked at many of the cuts. And ever since, unconvinced that President Fernando Henrique Cardoso had the political power to push through the rest of the package, investors have continued to flee the country.
The slow flight to the exits turned into a rush on Tuesday, when $1.2 billion fled the country. The immediate cause was a challenge to Mr. Cardoso from a tempestuous former President of Brazil, Itamar Franco, now Governor of the state of Minas Gerais. Mr. Franco said he would refuse to pay the state's debts to the Federal Government, claiming his coffers had been emptied by the economic downturn that has swept the country. If he paid the cash, he said, there would be little left for food, or salaries for state workers, or other social programs. Investors concluded, rightly or wrongly, that Mr. Cardoso was not firmly in control.
It was the kind of unpredictable event that has recurred time and again in the world financial crisis -- a clash between the demands of global investors who are looking for discipline and austerity, and political reality in countries that are tired of being told by Washington or the I.M.F. how to run their economies.
"This calls into question the whole efficacy of the American strategy," said Clyde Prestowitz, the president of the Economic Strategy Institute, and a former Commerce Department official. "The whole assumption of the Administration's approach is that we are going to aid countries that are committed to getting their act together. But if it's a big or important country -- Russia because of its nuclear power, Brazil because of its economic power -- there is a temptation to simply hope that they will get their act together. And the Brazilians didn't do it."
There are three big risks ahead.
The first is that Brazil will sink into an even deeper recession than the one it has been facing for months. To defend the currency at its newly devalued level, Brazil will likely have to keep interest rates extremely high for the near future. But that, in turn, could choke off economic activity -- at a time that factories are closing and middle-class workers are finding their jobs threatened.
"There is a real risk at this point that this could deteriorate badly," said Robert Hormats, the vice chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Company. "The question is whether they can contain the devaluation and get the reform program moving. Because there really is no Plan B."
The second risk is that contagion will be reignited, at least in the region, perhaps beyond. Because the Latin American economies are so interlinked, many economists were warning today that Argentina and Chile could easily fall into recession. That prospect -- and the social unrest it could engender -- was clearly on the mind of President Carlos Saul Menem of Argentina, during his visit this week to Washington.
"You could see the tension on their faces," said one Administration official who met with Mr. Menem and his advisers.
And finally there is the challenge to American credibility. After the failure of the rescue plan in Russia, Mr. Rubin and Mr. Clinton have a lot riding on their bet in Brazil. In November, with the Dow still down and nervousness about global economic trouble still fresh, Congress said not a word about putting $5 billion in American funds at risk.
But today Jim Saxton, a Republican from New Jersey who chairs the House Joint Economic Committee, called the "precautionary" package a "costly, counterproductive failure."
Mr. Rubin's view is, predictably, quite different. "I start from the view that the Brazilian program should work," he said Tuesday afternoon, as rumors of the devaluation were beginning to swirl. "It was a good program that was announced. Cardoso is deeply committed to getting this done."
But, he added, "The politics obviously are the key."

HEADLINE: Gore Says U.S. Is Willing to Help Iraq Get More Food and Medicine

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore said last night that the White House was willing to consider ways to loosen restrictions on Iraq's ability to buy food and medicine. He emphasized that the Administration's differences were with Saddam Hussein, not with the Iraqi people.
With the Administration facing criticism from some principal allies over the restrictions on food and medicine, Mr. Gore told an audience of Jewish organizations in Manhattan that the White House was considering ways to increase the flow of such essential supplies to the Iraqi people. In keeping with other Administration officials, he heatedly disputed the notion that the United States was to blame for food or medicine shortages in Iraq, and said that Mr. Hussein had repeatedly chosen to spend oil revenues on his nation's military. 
 "Saddam has consistently shown that he cares much more about developing weapons of mass destruction than developing the welfare of his people," Mr. Gore said. "He is the direct cause of suffering on the part of the Iraqi people."
Under United Nations sanctions, Iraq is able to sell a limited amount of oil to raise money for food and medicine imports.
Mr. Gore did not elaborate on his remarks, which he made during a speech on the Middle East peace effort to the Israeli Policy Forum, which brought together an audience of prominent American Jews in New York. But a senior White House aide said the Administration was examining ways to streamline the delivery of food and medicine to Iraq, and that the United States would raise the topic at a meeting of the Security Council in Manhattan today.
The aide said the Administration was also considering lifting some sanctions on the sale of oil by Iraq, which were put in place to punish Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait.
The White House adviser said the Administration was acting, in part, in response to concerns by allies about the way the embargo program was being portrayed. The effort to increase the delivery of essential goods was intended to "take the issue off the table."

New Evidence Surfaces In Salinas Murder Case
An audio tape recording has surfaced that further implicates Raul Salinas de Gotari, the eldest brother of Mexico's former President, in the 1994 killing of one of the country's most prominent politicians. The recording is significant because it appears to be free of the manipulation by police and prosecutors that so fouled other evidence in the case. A8

HEADLINE: Going After the Social Security Chimeras

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Milton Friedman (Op-Ed, Jan. 11) correctly urges "attention to fundamentals" in considering changes to Social Security. A major goal of Social Security in 1935 was to create jobs for younger workers during the Depression by providing an incentive for older ones to leave the labor force. 
 As Mr. Friedman notes, the increasing ratio of beneficiaries to workers is at the core of future Social Security problems. I wonder whether the system provides too much of a disincentive for people to work beyond 65 even though they would add value to the economy and improve the future worker-beneficiary ratio.

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Willamette Industries, a maker of paper and grocery bags, said yesterday that it would cut production at a paper mill in Kingsport, Tenn., and dismiss 150 workers at the site. The move, effective April 1, will eliminate 50,000 tons of capacity and result in a fourth-quarter pretax charge of $5 million. A total of 570 people work at the plant and at an adjacent lumber yard. Willamette said it was cutting back the operation because it was too small to be efficient. Its shares fell $1.1875, to $34.1875.

HEADLINE: Leo Cherne, Leader of Agency For Refugees, Is Dead at 86

BYLINE: By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN 

 BODY:
Leo Cherne, who turned the International Rescue Committee into the largest agency in the world for the relief and resettlement of refugees, died on Tuesday at Mount Sinai Medical Center. He was 86 and lived in Manhattan.
A lawyer, economist and businessman, Mr. Cherne became chairman of the I.R.C. in 1951, succeeding Reinhold Niebuhr, the theologian. The organization had grown out of modest efforts to rescue a few thousand endangered people from Nazi-occupied France in the early days of World War II. Under Mr. Cherne, the New York-based committee eventually helped hundreds of thousands of displaced, dispossessed and desperate people, first in Europe and then all over the world in places like Bangladesh, Southeast Asia, Latin America, the Horn of Africa, Afghanistan, Rwanda and Burundi. 
When Mr. Cherne was given the United States Medal of Freedom in 1984, President Reagan cited the "moral passion" he had shown in "serving the cause of human freedom, especially through his work on behalf of refugees."
Mr. Cherne was also an adviser to nine presidents, a close friend of William Casey, the former head of the C.I.A., and from 1973 to 1991 a member of the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, serving as its chairman during the Bush Administration. As a member of this low-profile but high-impact panel, Mr. Cherne helped create the so-called Team B, a group of experts headed by Richard Pipes, the Harvard historian, which disputed C.I.A. assessments of Soviet military capabilities and intentions as too dovish; the committee's more alarming estimates bolstered the positions of the strongest proponents of increased United States military expenditures.
Lionel Olmer, a lawyer and a former Undersecretary of Commerce, said that during his last hospital visit to his friend of 29 years, as the two men talked about human rights and refugees, Mr. Cherne told him, "I hope I'll also be remembered as a cold warrior."
Andrew Smith, who is working on an authorized biography of Mr. Cherne, said he was a man of great reticence and discretion. "He knew that the way to get and maintain influence in Washington was to get things done and then to keep quiet about them," Mr. Smith said. He added: "It certainly worked well for him, giving him access to every President since Roosevelt. Here was a poor boy from the Bronx, without money or family or influence, who became the consummate insider."
Mr. Cherne had been a Democrat since his youth but in 1980 became a figure in Democrats for Reagan because of the candidate's views on national security.
Leo Cherne was born in New York on Sept. 18, 1912, to Max and Dora Cherne, immigrants from Russia. His father had a photography store in the Bronx. He attended public schools, New York University and New York Law School.
After jobs in several law firms, in 1935 he teamed up with a Bible salesman from Kansas named Carl Hovgard to establish a company that published and distributed Mr. Cherne's advice to businessmen on how to contend with the new Social Security law. The book became extremely successful, and the company grew into the Research Institute of America, which offered Mr. Cherne's assessments about how world and political events would affect business.
At war's end, General Douglas MacArthur took him to Japan to work on the defeated nation's economic recovery.
The Research Institute of America was providing Mr. Cherne with a comfortable income, and his yearly economic and political forecast regularly drew a thousand listeners to the Waldorf Astoria. He joined the board of Freedom House and he became the chairman of the I.R.C., which was in financial difficulty at the time. His aggressive fund-raising staved off collapse and allowed for steady expansion.
In 1953, Mr. Cherne participated in a radio program, "The Town Meeting of the Air," on which he debated Senator Joseph McCarthy. Though Mr. Cherne shared Senator McCarthy's antipathy toward communism and its proponents, he strongly challenged and scorned McCarthyism's demagogic methods and contempt for truth and civil rights.
Three years later, when Soviet tanks moved into Budapest to crush the Hungarian uprising, Mr. Cherne went to the Hungarian border to bear witness. On his return, he appeared on the Ed Sullivan television program, poignantly describing refugees trying to evade tanks as they fled their occupied land. The appearance evoked an outpouring of contributions. It was the first of many such missions and public pleas by an essentially reticent man.
While working daily for the I.R.C., consulting often, if anonymously, in Washington, and writing economic analysis, Mr. Cherne also became an accomplished sculptor. Many of his busts are on prominent public display. He retired from the I.R.C. as chairman in 1991 but remained chairman emeritus and visited his office regularly until his recent illness. He received many decorations, among them the French Legion of Honor, Germany's Commander Cross and the United Nations Gold Medal of Peace.
Mr. Cherne is survived by his daughter, Gail Gambino of Baiting Hollow, N.Y., a brother, Jack Cherne of Santa Monica, Calif., and a granddaughter, Erica Gambino of Bridgehampton, N.Y.

CHERNE, LEO

 BODY:
CHERNE-Leo. Died peacefully Monday night at Mount Sinai Hospital after a long illness at age 86. Devoted father of Gail Gambino, the wife of Dr. Richard Gambino, grandfather of Erica Lynn Gambino, and brother of Jack Cherne. Leo's wife Phyllis died in 1995. Family services will be held Thursday, January 14, at 11AM, at The Jewish Center of the Hamptons, East Hampton, LI. A memorial service will be held on Wednesday, February 3rd, at 3:30PM at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, 81st and Madison Avenue. In lieu of flowers contributions in Leo's memory may be made to The Leo Cherne Refugee Emergency Fund, c/o The International Rescue Committee, 122 East 42nd Street, New York, NY 10168.
CHERNE-Leo. The Board of Directors, the staff and the worldwide family of the International Rescue Committee (IRC) are deeply saddened by the death of our Chairman Emeritus who joined our Board in 1946 and served as Chairman from 1951 to 1991. Leo achieved eminence as an economist, attorney, editor, political scientist, sculptor, educator, author, and as an advisor to U.S. Presidents starting with Franklin Roosevelt. But he often said that the over-riding "passion" among his activities was his work for refugees and the cause of human freedom. Many governments decorated Leo for his leadership of IRC and the refugee cause. Among those honors was the highest award a U.S. President can confer upon a civilian: the United States Medal of Freedom. The citation by President Reagan, in 1984, included the following passage: "Since the 1930's, Leo Cherne has stepped forward with brilliance, energy and moral passion and helped this nation overcome countless challenges. His lifetime devotion to aiding his country and to serving the cause of human freedom, especially through his work on behalf of refugees, reflects the strong and generous character of a man who deserves the respect and gratitude of all Americans." To Leo's daughter, Gail Gambino, her husband Dr. Richard Gambino, his granddaughter Erica Lynn Gambino, and his brother, Jack Cherne, we express our heartfelt sympathy. John C. Whitehead, Chairman Winston Lord, Vice Chairman Liv Ullmann, Vice Chairman International James C. Strickler, Chairman, Executive Committee Charles Sternberg, Secretary Reynold Levy, President Robert P. DeVecchi, President Emeritus International Rescue Committee
CHERNE-Leo. The Board of Trustess and friends of Freedom House mourn the death of Leo Cherne. As an Officer for over 40 years, Leo inspired our efforts on behalf of political freedom and civil liberties all over the world. Freedom's advocates have suffered a great loss. Bette Bao Lord, Chairman
CHERNE-Leo. Leo, my friend, I speak to you on behalf of the forgotten. The starving Cambodian child, the terrified Kurdish mother in hiding, the Bosnian fleeing genocide. For the thousands you saved, thank you. Sleep well. Jay Schulberg

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
U.S. financial industry may already have fortified itself against the latest emerging-market crisis.

BYLINE: By Timothy L. O'Brien and Joseph Kahn 

 BODY:
AS Yogi Berra once observed, it's deja vu all over again.
Brazil, which yesterday devalued its currency, the real, and announced the resignation of its central bank president, Gustavo Franco, is the latest victim of the global financial contagion that first broke out in Southeast Asia about 18 months ago. 
 And, as was the case when Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea and Russia each broke under the pressure of excessive debt and weakening currencies, there is now ample hand wringing about the United States financial community's exposure to Brazil's travails.
While Brazil's problems are certain to be a negative for American banks, brokerage firms, mutual and hedge funds and other investors in the country, it is still too early to know how extensive the damage will be. Most financial concerns have been reducing their exposure to Brazil since Russia's devaluation sent markets into a tailspin last summer and fall. "The markets tend to overreact to these events, but we won't know until the rest of the story plays out," said Raphael Soifer, an analyst with Brown Brothers Harriman & Company. "But it's never a good thing when currencies are devalued and central bankers resign."
Moreover, Brazil's fate depends on whether the country can achieve its goal of allowing the real to fall no further than another 12 percent against the dollar this year. A similar effort by the Russian Government to gradually devalue its currency, the ruble, failed miserably last August largely because confidence in the ruble and the Russian Government had evaporated. The real fell 8.4 percent against the dollar yesterday, to 75.65 cents.
"The reaction when the devaluation was first announced in Brazil was pretty bad there, but it appears that locals aren't converting reals into dollars because they know if everybody stampedes for the door it will only get worse," said Felipe Garcia Ascencio, an analyst with IDEA Inc., a research firm in New York. "The Latin American and U.S. economies will be hurt because financial activity in the region will be much slower. And everybody is worried that China will be next. So the key thing is to wait and see if this remains a controlled devaluation."
Brazil's ability to control the devaluation will be driven by its willingness to spend precious reserves defending the real. The central bank has kept interest rates artificially high to prop up the real while the country tries to introduce fiscal reforms. In the meantime, the central bank's dollar reserves have plunged to about $31 billion from $75 billion last summer as dollars continue to flee the country. Hundreds of millions of dollars a day have left the country this month as reals are converted into dollars, with about $2 billion withdrawn yesterday alone, according to 4Cast Inc., a New York research firm.
Financial services concerns have been anticipating a devaluation in Brazil for some time, and most say they have ample reserves to absorb any losses there. "Brazil is not a surprise," said Leslie Daniels Webster, head of market risk management at the Chase Manhattan Corporation. "It's like General Franco's dying. It was long rumored."
United States banks had about $16.7 billion of loans and other assets in Brazil at the end of June, the largest amount of any Latin American country, according to the Bank for International Settlements. But most American banks have been cutting back since then.
Citigroup's banking unit, Citibank, had about $3.9 billion of assets in Brazil at the end of September, the same amount held by Chase. BankAmerica had about $3.3 billion at the end of 1998's third quarter, while J. P. Morgan had $2.2 billion, Bankers Trust had $900 million and BankBoston had $860 million. While BankBoston's exposure is the largest relative to its size, all the banks said Brazil alone does not pose a threat to their financial well-being.
Among European banks, Spanish and Portuguese lenders are heavily exposed to Brazil. German banks have also been among the biggest lenders to Brazil and other countries in South America. In a report last November, the Bank for International Settlements noted that German banks were "taking the lead in the supply of fresh funds to Brazil."
Specific data on mutual funds' investments in Brazil are not kept, but open-end equity funds that have at least 10 percent of their assets in Brazil owned $6.3 billion in stock there as of last November, according to Lipper Inc.
Wall Street brokerage and investment banking firms have for years put Brazil near the top of their lists of emerging-market priorities. A surge of investment in the stock market there and the Brazilian Government's promise to sell state-owned property attracted every major United States investment bank.
But many of these firms said that they, like commercial banks, had been steadily reducing their financial exposure to Brazil. Investment bankers and analysts said losses from protracted weakness in Brazil would be small in comparison with the hundreds of millions of dollars many lost when Russia triggered last year's financial panic.
Exposure for most brokerage firms is minimal, analysts said. "Ever since the emerging markets blew up, they have been working hard to reduce their exposure," said Guy Moszkowski, brokerage industry analyst for Salomon Smith Barney.
Merrill Lynch & Company, for example, had substantial exposure to emerging-market debt until the Russian crisis but has since taken steps to reduce that exposure, Mr. Moszkowski said. Likewise for another big emerging-markets player, Lehman Brothers. Industry experts estimate that Lehman has just over $100 million in total exposure in Brazil, substantially reduced from the peak 1998 levels. Citigroup's investment banking unit, Salomon Smith Barney, is also believed to have little direct exposure to Brazil.
The investment bank with the greatest stake in Brazil is Credit Suisse First Boston. The Swiss-American bank six months ago paid $675 million to buy Garantia S.A., a leading Brazilian investment bank.
Credit Suisse First Boston reduced Garantia's inventory of Brazilian Government bonds recently and hedged its exposure to the market, preparing for the possibility of a devaluation, people who work at the bank said. Moreover, Garantia made profits last year and continues to operate profitably this month, Credit Suisse employees said.
Another significant difference between the Russian and Brazilian crises is that hedge funds, among the hottest of the hot money players that dart in and out of markets, have pulled back from Brazil since last summer, thus limiting the sense of panic surrounding Brazil.
Of course, any relative complacency about Brazil -- exemplified, perhaps, by how easily the United States stock market shrugged off Brazil's bad news yesterday -- will be tempered by how viciously and quickly its problems affect other markets.
"The U.S. market's reaction speaks volumes about the underlying resilience of this market," Alan Ruskin, research director at 4Cast, noted in a report yesterday. "It needs a knockout punch to severely dent the U.S. equity market, and Brazil in isolation is not it. But Brazil, Argentina, Hong Kong and China in quick sequence would provide a devastating backdrop that would draw the Fed back into 'rescue the world' mode again, firing on all salvos."

CORRECTION-DATE: January 16, 1999, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
The Market Place column in Business Day on Thursday, about the impact of Brazil's economic crisis on United States banks and brokerage firms, misstated Lehman Brothers' financial exposure in Brazil. It is $12 million ($100 million is the size of the firm's financial exposure in all of Latin America).

HEADLINE: TURMOIL IN BRAZIL: THE OVERVIEW;
BRAZIL DEVALUES ITS CURRENCY 8%, ROILING MARKETS

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Jan. 13

 BODY:
Challenged by political adversaries at home and nervous investors abroad, Brazil's Government devalued the nation's currency today, allowing it to fall by more than 8 percent and setting off turbulence in many world financial markets.
The action came after the surprise resignation of Brazil's central bank president and a week of declines in the stock market, the most recent ones severe. In the first 12 minutes of trading in Sao Paulo today, the benchmark Bovespa index dropped 10 percent, causing an automatic shutdown of trading. After the market reopened, shares recovered somewhat, ending the day down just over 5 percent. 
 By widening the exchange-rate band at which Brazil's currency, the real, can trade, officials revived investors' fears that renewed difficulties here could create problems in other Latin American nations, undermine a $41.5 billion rescue package from the International Monetary Fund, and lead to lower currency values in developing countries.
Since Russia's devaluation and partial debt default in August, foreign investors and Government officials have expressed concern that Brazil could also implode and drag the rest of Latin America down with it, especially its partners in the Mercosur trading bloc, such as Argentina. Brazil, the eighth-largest economy in the world, is the locomotive for Latin economies, which now absorb a fifth of United States exports.
Stock markets in Europe dropped 3 to 5 percent today, and elsewhere in Latin America by as much as 10.24 percent on the Brazil news. In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 125.12 points. although broader indexes cut their loses as the session wound down. United States Treasury bonds, long regarded as a haven for investors at times of trouble, surged in value.
"The big question now is one of the credibility of the Government," said Edmar Bacha, a former Government official who is now president of BBA Securities. "The first impression of the markets is 'Here we go; it's Mexico in December 1994 all over again. They've opened the door and there will be a flood."
Mr. Bacha alluded to Mexico's decision late in 1994 to stop defending its currency, the peso, as it was running out of dollars amid a worsening imbalance in its foreign trade accounts. The peso -- which was allowed to float to market value -- plunged, unnerving foreign investors and pushing Mexico into a deep and painful financial and economic crisis requiring an American-led bailout.
While Brazil has not followed Mexico's path, it has resisted suggestions that it devalue. So investors viewed the drop in the real today as an ominous sign that this devaluation could lead to a similar pattern. The devaluation eases pressure on the Government to spend its reserves and to keep interest rates high to defend the currency's value. The Government described the action as a way to restore consumer confidence and investors' credibility.
Francisco Lopes, the newly designated president of the central bank, opted for what Paulo Mallman, chief economist of Bic Banco in Sao Paulo, called "high-risk surgery." Since 1994, a key to Brazil's economic growth and reduced inflation has been a carefully calibrated exchange policy, which will now be discarded in favor of a more flexible but less predictable approach.
"The central bank should not be concerned with eventual corrections in the real exchange rate," Mr. Lopes said at a news conference in Brasilia today. "We believe that the real rate of exchange is a phenomenon that should be determined by market forces and should not be an objective of the central bank."
But he ruled out Mexican-style monetary policies, saying they would generate greater inflation -- long the nemesis of the Brazilian financial system. He estimated that Brazil has $45 billion in reserves and said that the Government was willing to use both that money and higher interest rates to defend what it considered a reasonable exchange rate.
The new central bank chief predicted that "the maximum nominal devaluation this year should remain between 12 and 15 percent." That would be approximately double the target of 7 percent that President Fernando Henrique Cardoso and his team of advisers set -- and largely adhered to -- in their first term.
"There is an atmosphere of sparks in the air, of anxiety, speculation and suspicion of the Government's ability to make good its commitments to the I.M.F.," Mr. Mallman of Bic Banco said. "People believed in the stability of the exchange policy, and that confidence has now been broken a bit. Everything that is going on leaves people feeling less secure and more apprehensive."
Concern about Congress's unwillingness to approve legislation that Mr. Cardoso says is essential to reducing a huge budget deficit has also contributed to uneasiness here.
In a boost to Mr. Cardoso, legislators this afternoon approved four important measures that would, among other things, impose new taxes on financial transfers and corporate profit. The measures are expected to generate more than $3 billion and to make up for shortages in other areas where the Government has as yet been unable to carry out reforms because of Congressional resistance.
In Washington today, President Clinton said he and members of the White House economic team had been monitoring the crisis in Brazil closely and had been in contact with the Brazilian authorities, the International Monetary Fund and United States allies.
"We have a strong interest in seeing Brazil, with whom we have worked on so many important things around the world, carry forward with its economic reform plan and succeed, and we certainly hope that they will," Mr. Clinton said.
President Cardoso, who began his second four-year term on Jan. 1, dismissed as unreasonable any fears that Brazil could default on the commitments it has made. "The Government has the means to meet all of its obligations," he said. "The Government will always honor all its internal and external obligations."
At a news conference, Mr. Cardoso described today's measures as a "technical modification" rather than a fundamental shift of policy. "his does not signify a change of direction," he said.
But that explanation seemed to fall on deaf ears. Though banks here continued to sell dollars at the very peak of the new trading band established by the Government -- 1.32 reais to the dollar, or 75.6 cents -- most currency exchanges were refusing to sell dollars at any price, anticipating that the Brazilian real would weaken further in days to come.
"It is certainly not a good sign that the real immediately went to the ceiling of the new band," said Carlos Geraldo Langoni, a former president of the central bank. "This is an attempt to save the existing exchange-rate regimen, but its success depends on the evaluation the market makes, so we will have to wait 15 days or so."
The crisis began late last week, when Itamar Franco, the new governor of populous Minas Gerais state, announced a 90-day moratorium on repayment of the $13.5 billion in debt his state owes to the federal Government. The action generated fear here and overseas that other states might follow suit and that Mr. Cardoso would be unable to comply with the terms of the I.M.F. rescue package.
The Sao Paulo stock market dropped, and in less than a week has lost nearly a quarter of its value. Looking for a haven abroad, investors on Tuesday sent $1.2 billion out of the country, rekindling fears of a huge-scale drain on reserves that had been calmed in November by the pledge from the I.M.F., after Brazil had lost nearly half its $75 billion in reserves before the Russian crisis.
During the first 12 days of the year, capital flows, including both from foreign investors and from Brazilians nervous about the fate of their savings, amounted to $2.2 billion. As of 8 P.M. today, an additional $900 million had left the country.
While events of the last week have plunged brokers, bankers and economists into something approaching panic, ordinary Brazilians seem less alarmed. It is the middle of summer here, and Rio's beaches and streets today were crowded with vacationers and shoppers looking ahead to next month's Carnival celebrations.
"People are being laid off left and right, and prices are sky-high," said Carlos Eduardo Braga Cavalcanti, while having a beer at beach-front stand tonight. "We're going to have all year to think about those problems, because they're not going to disappear."
Mr. Cardoso, who cut short his own beach vacation to return to the capital, urged Brazilians to remain calm and said his Government would stay the course. "t is essential Brazil continue with changes in our fiscal regime," he said, adding that reform measures already approved by Congress had led to "a marked advance" in Brazil's long-term economic health.
He and his advisers hope that the changes announced today in exchange-rate policy will, if successful, allow them to reduce interest rates, which reached nearly 50 percent last year. Those punishingly high rates are perhaps the principal reason the Brazilian economy has been pushed into a recession, which is expected to continue at least into the middle of the year.
But the President's remarks and policies immediately came under fire from an opposition that has been emboldened by Governor Franco's challenge to the authority of the federal Government. The leader of one opposition party, Leonel Brizola, praised Mr. Franco as "a symbol of national resistance" and urged the President to step down, while the principal opposition candidate in last fall's election, Luis Inacio Lula da Silva of the Workers Party, said the problem went far beyond Mr. Franco's act of defiance.
"Foreign investors have never heard of Minas Gerais," he said. "Their problem is a lack of confidence in the direction of the Brazilian economy. The whole economic team has to be changed, because Francisco Lopes is not going to change anything in the current orientation of the central bank."
Mr. Lopes, one of the architects of economic policy for the last five years, replaces Gustavo Franco, who will remain in the Government as a member of Mr. Cardoso's council of economic advisers. Economists and other analysts here said Mr. Franco stepped down because he preferred a more rigid exchange policy as a means to enforce economic discipline, but that on many other issues the two men are in basic agreement.
"Lopes is as conservative and orthodox as Franco is, and has better personal relationships within the Government and with Congress," Mr. Bacha said. "Once the market sees this, things will improve."

Selig Names Panel To Study Payrolls

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
On a day when the owners approved John Henry as the new owner of the Florida Marlins, Commissioner Bud Selig named a task force on baseball economics to help Major League Baseball try to figure out a solution to its payroll disparity problem.
 
 Selig, who will serve as chairman of what he is calling a Blue Ribbon Task Force on Baseball Economics, named 13 officials from 12 different clubs and four outsiders - George Mitchell, the former Senate majority leader; Paul Volcker, the former chairman of the board of the Federal Reserve System; Richard Levin, the president of Yale University, and George Will, the political columnist.
 Selig said the task force would analyze all aspects of baseball's economic system and make recommendations and suggestions to the commissioner that address the game's economic issues and problems. Payroll disparity, which has created an increasingly greater separation between high-revenue and low-revenue teams, is the No. 1 problem.
 Selig said the Players Association would be kept apprised of the task force's progress. "My hope," he said, "is that the Blue Ribbon Task Force will develop creative, new ideas that ultimately can be used in collective bargaining."
 The Marlins, who underwent the greatest payroll purge in baseball history after winning the World Series in 1997, are now one of the teams at the low end of the payroll scale. Henry, a Florida commodities trader, bought the team from H. Wayne Huizenga for $150 million. Henry owns slightly more than 1 percent of the Yankees and will have to sell it.
 In another piece of business at the owners' quarterly meeting in Carlsbad, Calif., George Steinbrenner, was not reappointed to the major league executive council. His term expired, and he was replaced by John Ellis of Seattle.

HEADLINE: AUTOS ON FRIDAY /Technology;
Cars and Natural Gas: A Better Fit

BYLINE: By MICHELLE KREBS 

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
THE Dodge Charger design study, introduced by DaimlerChrysler last week at the North American International Auto Show here, looks like a modern rendition of the 1960's muscle car from which it got its name. Under its long hood, the Charger concept car, like its predecessor, has a powerful V8 -- in this case, a supercharged 4.7-liter engine producing 325 horsepower.
But instead of the gas-guzzling, pollution-belching engines of Chargers in the late 60's and early 70's, the show car has a superclean engine that runs on compressed natural gas, known as C.N.G. If the Charger were put into production, it would qualify as an ultra-low-emission vehicle in California. 
 With the Charger, DaimlerChrysler is not only resurrecting a popular name and making the point that alternative-fuel vehicles can be fun, it is showcasing a new technology to store compressed natural gas that could make the clean-burning fuel more practical for everyday use. The Charger's tank storage system was developed by the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University, which primarily conducts research for the Federal departments of Defense and Energy. The tanks' compact size, reduced weight and ease of installation are comparable to the traits of gasoline tanks, John Wozniak, manager of the lab's advanced natural gas vehicle project, said in a recent interview.
The Charger concept with the new storage tanks is designed to carry an amount of natural gas equivalent to 12 gallons of gasoline, providing a travel range of 300 to 350 miles. Typically, natural-gas vehicles, like a C.N.G. version of the Dodge Ram Van, can go only about 100 miles on a tank. Furthermore, the tanks give designers more flexibility, allowing them to reserve the car's trunk for cargo instead of for bulky tanks.
With traditional C.N.G. tanks, the fuel is in cylinders that are individually wrapped in expensive carbon-fiber material, each with its own safety valve. The integrated storage system in the Charger concept car, and in a test fleet of Plymouth Breeze and Dodge Stratus sedans, combine the cylinders into a single-wrapped package that is placed in a solid housing that somewhat resembles an egg carton, with one safety valve for all. The design reduces the complexity, weight and use of expensive carbon fiber, and thus lowers the cost, Mr. Wozniak said.
With a more versatile flat shape, the tank can be installed behind the back seat or underneath the vehicle, like a traditional gasoline tank. The Breezes in the demonstration fleet, which will soon be given to consumers for further testing, currently carry the equivalent of 12 gallons of gasoline and can run 350 miles between refilling, Mr. Wozniak said. The cars have 12.5 cubic feet of trunk space, compared with 15.7 for a gasoline-powered Breeze.
The packaging advancements have cut the cost of a CNG storage tank by half, to about $2,500. Still, that is far more than the $50 to $100 cost of a conventional gasoline tank. Nevertheless, DaimlerChrysler executives say they think natural-gas vehicles hold promise because of their high fuel economy, lower emissions and plentiful supplies of the fuel.
In the short term, DaimlerChrysler sees potential for C.N.G. vehicles in niche applications, like corporate fleets that are fueled in central locations. Bernard Robertson, senior vice president for engineering technologies for DaimlerChrysler, said the new storage system might allow auto makers to use C.N.G. in other vehicle segments, including sports cars, beyond vans, pickups and large sedans.
Chrysler offered natural-gas vehicles in the early 90's, but stopped when a fleet market did not develop. Another problem was the lack of a secondary market for reselling cars turned back in by fleet operators. Last fall, Chrysler re-entered the market with two models, a Dodge Ram Van and a Ram Wagon, that meet California's even stricter "super ultra low" emission standards.

HEADLINE: '98 Featured Low Inflation, Brisk Buying By Consumers

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 14

 BODY:
Consumer prices rose in 1998 at their slowest pace in 12 years and retail sales surged in December, capping a year in which rising wages allowed consumer spending to rise at its fastest pace since 1984 and energized the economy's longest peacetime expansion.
The Consumer Price Index rose 1.6 percent last year, less than 1997's 1.7 percent increase and the lowest annual inflation rate since 1986, the Labor Department said today. In December, prices rose only one-tenth of a percent as declines in gasoline and home heating oil prices offset higher cigarette prices. 
 Retail sales rose 5.1 percent in 1998, topping the 4.3 percent increase in 1997, the Commerce Department said today. Near-record sales at the Ford Motor Company, DaimlerChrysler A.G. and other auto makers, and double-digit sales increases at furniture and home improvement stores pushed December sales nine-tenths of a percent higher.
"We have seldom experienced what we have now: low unemployment, low interest rates and low inflation," said Gary Thayer, an economist at A. G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis. "Consumers were out there taking advantage of it."
A separate Labor Department report showed that average weekly earnings adjusted for inflation rose half a percent in December and 1.8 percent for 1998.
"With inflation going down, especially in the goods area, real spending has been phenomenally strong," said John Ryding, senior economist at Bear, Stearns & Company in New York.
Auto makers reported that unit sales of autos and trucks rose 7 percent in December. That translated into a 2.5 percent increase in sales at automotive dealers, which also includes spending on auto repairs and parts. If autos were excluded, December sales rose four-tenths of a percent, the Commerce Department figures showed.
The nation's strong housing market also played a role in last month's retail strength. Sales at building materials stores rose 1.3 percent, and furniture and household store sales increased six-tenths of a percent.
In contrast, sales fell two-tenths of a percent at general merchandise stores and six-tenths of a percent at apparel stores. Analysts blamed warm weather at the beginning of December, which held down sales of winter merchandise and led retailers to cut prices.
The Consumer Price Index report showed that the cost of apparel and upkeep fell eight-tenths of a percent in December, the biggest drop since August 1989. That depressed retail apparel sales, which are reported in dollars. "It's more a price than sales problem," said David Orr, chief economist at the First Union Corporation in Charlotte, N.C.
Separately, the Labor Department reported that the number of workers applying for unemployment benefits fell by 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 352,000 in the week ended Saturday.
That was likely depressed by the snowstorms that swept through the Midwest and East during that week, analysts said. The four-week average for new claims, watched by investors as a more reliable indicator of employment levels, rose to 342,250, from 329,250 the previous week. That is the highest since 360,500 in the week ended July 18, 1998.

HEADLINE: DROPPING THE BALL: The Decline Of School Sports;
A South Bronx Tale: Of Promises Kept, On and Off the Court

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
Wade Williams, the assistant principal and basketball coach at Bronx Regional High School, makes a promise to every boy at the school: If you play basketball for me, he tells them, and work harder than you ever have in your life, and stay out of trouble and graduate, I can help you get out of the South Bronx.
In a neighborhood where the 1990's boom economy is somebody else's news, Williams's promise is a beacon. It calls to young men who see mostly dead ends around them, Williams said. 
 "That's what brings them to me, that promise," he said. "And I've been pretty good with it."
Sports still mean something very powerful in this school. In some ways it is an old sports story -- the dream of using one's talent to rise up, become something more than you are. But it is also a very up-to-date New York sports story in its awareness of limits.
Williams makes no pretense that his basketball players are angels. All of them ended up here because something happened. One boy was kicked out of his old school for assault and battery. Many others ran into academic trouble.
These kids may dream of N.B.A. careers and glamour, but they all know that no one from Bronx Regional has ever got a scholarship to anything better than a two-year junior college -- a juco, in the jargon of the coaches and players. And Williams says he is careful never to promise more than that.
But on that, and a shoestring budget of $1,048 for a school year -- to run all the sports programs and physical education, too -- he has been able to establish a basketball dynasty. In the Public Schools Alternative League -- reserved for schools like his in which many of the students are older -- Bronx Regional is the power to be reckoned with. Over the past 10 years, Williams's teams have played for the championship every year and won it seven times, including the last six in a row.
What he battles is the stigma of being thought of -- by colleges and, he believes, by the city's sports system itself -- as a dumping ground for kids of lesser value.
"We're a stepchild -- we don't get the publicity, we don't get the money, I don't get a sneaker contract," he said. "Whatever I've got, I earned."
But that is enough to hook kids like Milton Rollins.
Rollins, an 18-year-old native of the South Bronx, is a young man with plans. On a recent day just before practice, he filled out nine job applications. His first choice was a job in a sneaker store, and the rest, he said, were there just in case. He dreams of playing professional basketball but wants to study electrical engineering -- again, just in case.
"I'm trying to get out of the 'hood," he said. "I'm positive -- I'm sure -- I'm going to make it out."
And Williams says his boys have helped him, too.
Though he once dreamed of coaching in a traditional New York City high school, he doesn't anymore. The rewards in the South Bronx are simply too great to walk away from, Williams said.
"I think I've got more to offer here," he said.

HEADLINE: Florida Ends Support for a High-Speed Train

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Jan. 14

 BODY:
Plans for a high-speed train that would link Florida's three major metropolitan areas appeared dead after Gov. Jeb Bush pulled out state financing today, saying the project posed too much financial risk for taxpayers.
In one of his first decisions as Governor, Mr. Bush announced that he would withhold money for the rail project in his 1999-2000 budget and not seek the release of money previously appropriated for work related to the train. The state has already spent $22.4 million of the more than $2 billion it had earmarked for the $6.3 billion project. A Federal loan and private money would have financed the rest. 
 "At this point the project does appear to be canceled," said Lisa Boyette, a spokeswoman for Fluor Daniel, an American engineering and construction company that was part of the private international consortium known as the Florida Overland Express, the state's financial partner in the project.
Governor Bush, a Republican who met with the project's representatives and his economic development transition team before making his decision, cited concerns like a lack of consensus about ridership projections, the environmental impact and costs that are "still considered a moving target." With billions of public dollars at stake and uncertainty about whether enough Floridians would use the train to make it a success, he said, the money would best be spent on other transportation needs.
Leaders in the legislature, which is controlled by Republicans, supported the decision, or at least a re-evaluation of the project.
"The uncertainty and risk to Florida's taxpayers are too great to continue funding this project with our tax dollars," the Governor said. "I hope this funding could go toward finding creative ways to transport our state's working poor and welfare-to-work participants to jobs, assist our urban communities with congestion and promote projects that would link our airports and seaports to enhance trade, commerce and economic competitiveness."
The Clinton Administration has called high-speed rail the missing link in the national transportation system and had lauded Florida for being the first state to pledge such a significant amount of public money to the effort.
In a statement today after Mr. Bush's announcement, Jolene M. Molitoris, the Federal railroad administrator, said, "The Clinton Administration supports high-speed rail and believes it is a crucial component of transportation in the 21st century."
Efforts in other states have repeatedly failed to obtain financing, and Florida, which authorized the train under a 1992 law, was expected to become a model.
The train, scheduled to begin service between Miami and Orlando in 2004 and to Tampa by 2006, would have whisked passengers at up to 200 miles per hour, like similar bullet trains found in Japan and Europe. In 1996, when the state signed the deal with Florida Overland Express, state officials said they expected the train to ease congestion on highways and runways as the state faced enormous traffic growth.
Opponents of the project said it was too heavily subsidized by the state and doubted that it would ever attract enough demand to avoid losing money. The state had earmarked $70 million of its $3 billion budget for high-speed rail capital costs each year for the next 40 years.
In addition to the Fluor Corporation's engineering and construction subsidiary, the project's consortium included GEC Alsthom, the French-British company that developed the technology for France's T.G.V. (train a grande vitesse), which would have been used for Florida's trains. GEC Alsthom is a joint venture between the General Electric Company P.L.C. of Britain and Alcatel Alsthom S.A. of France.
David Gedney, chief executive officer of Florida Overland Express, or FOX, said: "We are disappointed. The contributions of many people, working to make FOX viable and help solve Florida's transportation challenges, are being negated."

HEADLINE: Microsoft Witness Attacked For Contradictory Opinions

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 14

 BODY:
A Justice Department lawyer produced several prominent academic papers today that he said showed that the Microsoft Corporation's first witness in its antitrust trial had written opinions contradicting views he has offered in expert testimony for the software giant.
In a broad attack on the witness, Richard L. Schmalensee, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, David Boies, the Government's lead trial lawyer, produced evidence that a survey cited by Mr. Schmalensee in his testimony actually appeared to be a publicity tool ginned up by Microsoft's chairman, William H. Gates. 
 In Mr. Schmalensee's direct testimony, he wrote that in a recent survey of software developers, "85 percent predicted that Microsoft's integration of Internet functions into Windows would help their company, and 83 percent predicted it would help consumers." He cited the figures to support his own advocacy of those positions.
"Did you ever look at that survey, find out what its purpose was?" Mr. Boies asked. When Mr. Schmalensee said he had not, Mr. Boies asked, "Did anyone ever tell you that the purpose was to give Mr. Gates helpful information to use at a Senate hearing" early last year?
Then Mr. Boies produced an E-mail message in which Mr. Gates wrote last February, "It would HELP ME IMMENSELY to have a survey showing that 90 percent of developers believe that putting the browser into the operating system makes sense," adding, "Ideally we would have a survey before I appear at the Senate on March 3rd."
In a subsequent string of E-mail messages, Microsoft employees laid out how they would pose the questions to get the responses Mr. Gates wanted.
Mr. Schmalensee said that had he known the origin of the polling information, he would have cited the figures in his testimony anyway, though he might have added "an explanatory phrase."
Through most of the day, Mr. Boies worked to tear down Mr. Schmalensee's central argument: that Microsoft does not hold significant marketing power and in fact faces real competition in the market for personal computer operating systems.
On Wednesday and today, Mr. Schmalensee argued at length that Linux, a free Unix-based operating system, posed a significant near-term threat to Windows, the Microsoft operating system that is shipped on more than on 90 percent of all new computers. He said he came to this conclusion largely from reading newspaper and magazine articles, particularly the computer trade press.
With that, Mr. Boies introduced into evidence an article from PC Week On Line last June in which Mr. Gates, in an interview, said that Linux posed no threat to Windows.
"I've never had a customer mention Linux to me," he said.
Mr. Schmalensee said Mr. Gates's statement "is at least interpretable as a marketing statement."
Mr. Schmalensee testified that the small competitors nipping at Microsoft's operating system business should be considered serious threats. And he said that their existence showed that the barriers to entry into the operating system market were not high, so Microsoft should not be viewed as a monopoly power.
But in an article in the Antitrust Law Journal in 1997, Mr. Schmalensee wrote: "A clear signal of low barriers to entry is provided only by effective, viable entry" into the market "that takes a nontrivial market share. There is a substantial difference between toehold entry and substantial entry that provides real pressure on established firms' profits."
Mr. Schmalensee acknowledged under questioning that no competitor to Microsoft had ever met that test. Still, he argued, Microsoft had behaved and spent research and development money as if it did face competitive threats, particularly from the International Business Machines Corporation, which introduced the unsuccessful OS/2 operating system almost 10 years ago. That, he suggested, put pressure on Microsoft's profits, meeting one of his tests.
"I discussed this with Mr. Gates," he said. "He told me about the time when cooperation between Microsoft and I.B.M. ended; I.B.M. said effectively: 'We will bury you.' He took that threat very seriously."
Mr. Schmalensee said that Microsoft had spent money on research to counter that threat. But when pressed, he acknowledged that he really had no direct knowledge of that and was only presuming it to be the case.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: CURRENCIES;
Dollar Falls Against Euro but Gains vs. Yen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar was mixed against other currencies yesterday as worries about Brazil's faltering economy reverberated through markets.
The dollar fell against the euro, the single European currency, in reaction to a drop in stocks on Wall Street, where investors worried that the turmoil in Brazil would spread throughout Latin America. 
 The dollar rose slightly against the yen, however, as traders feared the Japanese authorities would again enter the market to support the dollar if it resumed its recent slide. The Japanese central bank bought dollars on the open market on Tuesday to stem the yen's rise, which hurts exports.
In New York, the euro was trading at $1.1710, up from $1.1666 on Wednesday. The dollar also was quoted at 113.61 Japanese yen, up from 113.33.

HEADLINE: Senator Plans Bill to Expand 401(k) Plans

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
A new type of 401(k) retirement savings plan that would allow withdrawals free of taxes is expected to be proposed today by the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.
The proposal would greatly expand Americans' savings options and would allow them to save far more each year in retirement accounts. It could even raise money initially for the Federal Government because workers would pay income taxes on the money they contribute to the new plan, not on what they take out. 
 But over the long term, it would deplete revenues and is expected to face opposition from the Clinton Administration and Democrats in Congress, where it will be one of several competing ideas about how to cut taxes this year. Mr. Clinton has said he will oppose any tax cut until an agreement is reached to shore up Social Security.
The major portion of the proposal, called a Roth 401(k), would extend the popular 401(k) plans for employees and would operate on the same principles as the recently created Roth I.R.A., said Senator William V. Roth Jr., Republican of Delaware, who is chairman of the finance committee. Mr. Roth sponsored the 1976 law giving unemployed spouses the right to individual retirement accounts and the 1981 law letting anyone with a job create an I.R.A.
Contributions to a Roth I.R.A. are made with dollars that have already been taxed, but none of the investment earnings on that money are subject to taxes; nor are withdrawals. With conventional I.R.A.'s, workers do not pay income taxes on the money they contribute, but both the contributions and their gains are taxed when the money is withdrawn.
Financial institutions reported a rush of activity at the end of last year as people opened Roth I.R.A.'s. But not everyone can contribute to a Roth I.R.A., which has income and other restrictions. Many more people could take advantage of a Roth 401(k) at work, paying taxes on their contributions but not on any growth in that money or any withdrawal. In 401(k)'s, workers choose how to invest their money, and employers often match part of their contributions to encourage participation.
Senator Roth said he wanted to give people more incentives to save and to expand their savings options.
His proposal would allow workers to increase their savings substantially in tax-advantaged accounts. The maximum annual contribution to a Roth 401(k) and a conventional 401(k) plan would climb to $15,000 from $10,000. Workers age 50 and older would be allowed to set aside as much as $22,500 a year.
The current limit on I.R.A. contributions would rise to $5,000 from $2,000, and workers 50 and older could set aside up to $7,500.
Most income limits on I.R.A.'s would also be eliminated under Mr. Roth's proposal. That means that older workers with high incomes could save up to $30,000 annually through a combination of 401(k) and I.R.A. plans, and could use any mix of traditional and Roth plans.
Roth 401(k) plan funds would have to be withdrawn, beginning at age 70 1/2, under the same rules as existing 401(k) plans. Roth I.R.A.'s have no such requirements on withdrawals. Rules governing employer contributions to 401(k) plans would be liberalized to allow up to $30,000 in matching contributions, now limited to 25 percent of salary.
The Roth 401(k), which would be accompanied by a similar Roth 403(b) plan for government workers and employees of nonprofit groups, could in its first few years raise Government revenues. But there are two serious downsides: it would cost the Government money in the long run and most of the tax benefits would go to people with higher incomes.
Robert S. McIntyre of Citizens for Tax Justice, a Washington nonprofit organization that says the tax system favors the rich, said that "the middle class will be subsidizing the savings of the rich" under Senator Roth's proposal.
The plan, Mr. McIntyre said, would move the tax system closer to the plan by Representative Dick Armey, Republican of Texas, to tax all wages at the same rate and to eliminate taxes on gains and income from investments.
Mr. McIntyre and two Capitol Hill Democrats who work on tax policy said that they expected the White House to oppose any plan that increased tax benefits to the rich.
Among the many elements in Mr. Roth's proposed Retirement Savings Opportunity Act of 1999 are a provision to eliminate income limits for traditional I.R.A.'s and for Roth I.R.A.'s and to make the rules more liberal on converting existing accounts to Roth I.R.A.'s. Workers could invest their I.R.A. money in employers' retirement plans, which could reduce administrative costs.
On traditional corporate pension plans, which are funded and managed by employers, Mr. Roth proposes to allow corporate income tax deductions for contributions even if plans have 50 percent more money than they need to pay benefits. That would eliminate most of the pressure on companies with overfunded plans to reduce the surplus and preserve their tax deduction.

HEADLINE: DROPPING THE BALL: The Decline Of School Sports;
Working to Preserve a Vanished World

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
Hank Whitney's life turned a corner in the early 1950's when he discovered basketball. He was poor and black and growing up on welfare in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, and the best he could look forward to, he said, was a factory job. Instead he found a whole new world.
Whitney had talent, but more than that, he said, he had access to a city athletic system that worked. He played basketball -- and learned the game -- in the public schools and community centers that were always open until 10 P.M. He would even dribble the ball down the hallway in his family's apartment building coming home. Then he would do it all again the next night. 
 Now, as the principal at the same Brooklyn middle school where he struggled and found his way, he mourns a world that has passed. The sports system that worked for him has been nearly washed away by the years, and Whitney tries to preserve whatever part of it he can for kids in whom he sees a part of himself.
"I have to look from whence I came," said Whitney, a 6-foot-7-inch bear of a man with a voice so deep that it sounds as if it's coming from the bottom of a well. "I know what the system did for me -- it saved my life."
Whitney, who is 59, was one of the first black athletes to win a scholarship and a place on the previously all-white Iowa State University basketball team in the late 1950's, one of three New York City boys then on the team. He also helped found the American Basketball Association and was one of the original members of the New Jersey Americans -- now known as the Nets -- in 1967 until an injury cut his career short after three seasons.
"The New York City school system was spitting out athletes like it was just unbelievable," he said. "Throughout New York City, all five boroughs, scholarships to just about every university in the country."
The crumbling of that world hit him hard. He was working in a Brooklyn community center in 1969 when all the centers were closed. He was teaching in the mid-1970's when the fiscal crisis rubbed out just about everything that was left. In the mid-1980's, as principal of his old school, Intermediate School 49, he had to cut his gym program from five teachers to three.
He says he believes the worst of the storm may have passed. If the city's economy can stay strong, Whitney thinks, more money will start to trickle back down into sports and athletics. But he is not waiting. He has assembled a package of private grants that help him conduct after-school intramural programs.
He gets just enough to keep the school open until 6 P.M. four nights a week for about three months, and he doles out those hours like a miser. His central strategy is to keep kids off the street, and thus out of trouble. Since he can't do that with after-school programs alone, he also counts on the weather.
"I figure the cold will keep them inside when that comes -- so I'm covered there," he said. "So we'll do it in the warm months, to try and keep them inside then."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Argentine Rates Jump And the Market Tumbles

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Jan. 14

 BODY:
Argentine interest rates surged as the local stock market tumbled for a second day in response to the devaluation of Brazil's currency. But several senior Argentine officials pledged that they would not budge the peso from its one-to-one linkage to the dollar or veer from other free-market policies.
President Carlos Saul Menem projected calm as he returned from a state visit in the United States, appearing on national television smiling and dressed in a sport shirt and slacks. "This will pass quickly," he said, even as he summoned his Cabinet for an emergency meeting. 
 Argentines did not panic despite alarming headlines in the local financial press, with economists reporting almost no withdrawal of deposits from local banks over the last two days. But foreign investors continued to sell Argentine stocks heavily, with Argentina's Merval index opening the day sharply lower even as Brazil's Bovespa was showing early, tentative signs of recovery.
The Merval, which plunged 10.2 percent Wednesday, fell another 4.3 percent today.
Argentina's economy is closely linked to Brazil's because 30 percent of its exports go to its northern neighbor. With the devaluation of the Brazilian currency, the real, Argentine goods will become less competitive on the Brazilian market and high interest rates are likely to further limit the buying power of Brazilian consumers. Private economists predicted that a coming economic contraction -- particularly in the auto, steel and cement industries -- would lower corporate earnings, squeeze tax receipts, and force the Government to reduce spending in the coming months.
The impact of the Brazilian crisis has been immediate, with the prime interest rate for private businesses rising from 11 percent to more than 13 percent overnight. Meanwhile, even as Government officials spoke optimistically of the future, they held off plans to issue a new global bond and privatize part of the National Mortgage Bank until international capital markets calmed.
"The Argentine economy will react with a deep recession," predicted Dario Lizzano, head of equity research at Santander Investments in Buenos Aires. "There will be a lack of credit and that will generate a strong increase in interest rates at least in the short term." Gustavo Canonero, a senior economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in Buenos Aires, said, "In this volatile economy, you will see the Merval continue to be weak."
But, in an interview, Deputy Economy Minister Pablo Guidotti sketched out a brighter scenario. "At this point, it is still early to say the current situation in Brazil will delay our recovery," he said. "Brazil's problems now mean a closing of capital markets and increasing our country risk premium, but this will have no lasting affect if the situation in Brazil is short-lived."
As a result of Brazil's devaluation, many Wall Street and local economists have revised their forecasts for the Argentine economy in 1999, from 2.5 percent growth to zero or even a contraction after nearly a decade of almost uninterrupted expansion. Most economists say the 12.4 percent unemployment rate is likely to go higher.
Nevertheless, independent economists and political analysts said they believed President Menem would not veer off his free-market course, in part because it now appeared certain that he would not be a candidate for re-election later this year. And since Mr. Menem is a sworn enemy of the likely presidential candidate of the ruling Justicialist Party, the Buenos Aires Governor, Eduardo Duhalde, most observers feel it is unlikely he will be tempted to return to old populist policies.
The linchpin of Mr. Menem's economic policy has been the peg of the peso to the dollar, known to economists as "convertibility." The currency peg is set by law and prohibits the Government from issuing new money unless new pesos are backed by dollars or gold reserves in the central bank.
The peg, instituted in 1991, reduced Argentina's inflation rate from more than 2,000 percent to single digits almost immediately. The peg withstood intense pressure after the devaluation of the Mexican peso in December 1994. Economists also noted that the Argentine economy had been strengthened in recent years by tighter Government banking regulations that raised mandatory bank reserve requirements.

HEADLINE: Internet Company Has a Strong Share Sale

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 14

 BODY:
Marketwatch.com Inc., which runs a popular World Wide Web site covering financial news, raised $46.8 million in an offering to institutional investors today.
The San Francisco-based company sold 2.75 million shares, a 23 percent stake, at $17 each. That was $1 more than the top of the expected range of $14 to $16, which had been raised from $10 to $12 on Wednesday by the lead underwriters BT Alex. Brown and Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities. The sale gave Marketwatch.com a market capitalization of $199.8 million. 
 Based on the rise in the sale price and strong investor demand before the sale, the shares are expected to increase sharply when public trading begins on Friday.
The institutional sale follows three days of declines for most Internet stocks and broad market indexes. The Dow Jones industrial average has fallen 5.2 percent since Monday, led by concerns that Brazil's economic problems will hurt profits at many United States companies, while the Interactive Week Internet index fell 9.3 percent on concern that Internet stocks are overvalued.
The expectations that shares of Marketwatch.com shares will soar have caused the stock price of the Data Broadcasting Corporation to more than triple in the last month. Data Broadcasting, which sells financial market data to individuals via satellite and cable, owns Marketwatch.com with the CBS Corporation, and will own 38 percent of the Internet company after the sale.
Shares of Data Broadcasting fell $1.4375 today, to $31.1875; those of CBS fell $1, to $34.125.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Shares Continue to Fall; The Dow Drops 228.63

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Stocks fell for a fourth consecutive session yesterday as fears intensifed that Brazil's financial turmoil, reflected in the devaluation of its currency, might spread to other Latin economies and dampen business with the United States.
Unlike Wednesday's session, when blue-chip stocks recovered more than half of their losses during the day, prices rallied only mildly in late trading yesterday, not enough to keep the Dow Jones industrial average from slipping into negative territory for 1999. 
 "Brazil is on the brink and Argentina may follow," said Neil T. Eigen, managing director at J.& W. Seligman. "The realization is taking hold that the United States doesn't go it on our own."
As is usual on word of foreign distress, shares of banks and other financial companies were prominent casualties because of possibly soured loans and losses in securities trading. J. P. Morgan lost 4 9/16 a share, to 102; Suntrust fell 3 9/16 , to 72 11/16 ; Chase Manhattan was down 3 3/8, to 68 1/4; Mellon dropped 3 1/4, to 65 1/8, and Citigroup fell 1 5/16 , to 50 7/8.
Analysts also said the start of the impeachment trial of President Clinton contributed to the wider market decline, noting that the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which had stabilized for more than 90 minutes, resumed its slump as television coverage began at 1 P.M.
"It took buyers away and brought in some nervous selling," said Fane Lozman of Scanshift, a research company in Chicago.
At the close, the Dow was at 9,120.93, down 228.63 points, or 2.45 percent, its worst point loss since Sept. 30. That brought the two-day damage to 353.75 points, or 3.7 percent. The Dow is now down six-tenths of 1 percent for the year.
The S.& P. 500 fell 22.21 points yesterday, or 1.8 percent, to 1,212.19, and the Nasdaq composite index dropped 39.99 points, or 1.73 percent, to 2,276.82. The S.& P. 500 is down 1.39 percent for the year, but Nasdaq is still up 3.84 percent.
Foreign markets, which were severely battered on Wednesday, ended mixed, but Brazil's Bovespa suffered much of its pounding -- nearly 10 percent -- after European markets had closed.
Market analysts said that high valuations had made the market particularly susceptible to shocks, especially one with the potential to do a lot of damage, like Brazil.
"This is a market correction inspired by the Brazilian crisis, added to by the Presidential impeachment," said John H. Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at Advest Inc. in Boston. But he said the pullback was probably healthy, "squeezing euphoria out of the market" while not seriously threatening American business.
Analysts also took note of the very solid United States economy, confirmed in yesterday's Government reports of a surprisingly big rise in retail sales for December and almost nonexistent consumer inflation.
Among the 30 component stocks of Dow industrials, the biggest loser by far was Eastman Kodak, which plunged 8 3/16 a share, to 70 1/2, as the company reported fourth-quarter profits that were lower than expected. Kodak accounted for more than 30 points of the drop in the Dow, whose only gainer was General Electric, which rose 1/2, to 97 1/16 .
No major sectors escaped punishment, but some analysts said they were impressed that high-flying Internet stocks, which have become increasingly difficult to trade, held up relatively well.
While Yahoo fell 23 15/16 a share, to 344 1/16 , and Amazon.com fell 10, to 138, other Internet stocks surged. Ebay and Ubid, two auction companies, climbed; Ebay jumped 9 13/16 a share, to 225 5/16 ; Ubid rose 3 7/16 , to 91 1/2. America Online, another recent star, eased 1 1/4, to 144 1/2.
And the Russell 2000, an index comprising small-company stocks, was 1.12 percent lower, less than half the decline of the Dow.
On the New York Stock Exchange, declining issues outnumbered advancers by 2,161 to 903.
Despite Brazil's meltdown, stocks in Mexico rose 1.7 percent yesterday after nine consecutive sessions of declines. Markets also rose in Tokyo, by 2.5 percent, and Paris by nearly 1 percent. Stocks fell 1.6 percent in Frankfurt, five-tenths of 1 percent in London and eight-tenths of 1 percent in Hong Kong.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Treasuries Gain Sharply
 (By Bridge News) -- Treasury prices posted big gains yesterday for the third consecutive session as Brazil's problems continued to encourage flight-to-quality buying of United States Government securities.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 1 5/32 , to 103 1/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.05 percent, from 5.13 percent on Wednesday.
Stock market losses contributed to yesterday's bond gains, as did large Treasuries purchases by hedge funds. Treasuries also benefited from the release of economic data, including a lower-than-expected rise in December consumer prices.
Jack Ablin, a managing director at Colonial Asset Management in Jacksonville, Fla., said he thought that Brazil's problems and the United States stock market's losses were encouraging the bond market's hopes for another cut in interest rates by the Federal Reserve.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
CRISIS IS DEEPENING IN BRAZIL MARKETS

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Jan. 14

 BODY:
Propelled by a drop in Brazil's international credit rating and growing doubts about the Government's ability to defend the newly devalued currency, the Brazilian stock market was forced to suspend trading again today and closed down nearly 10 percent.
Adding to a sense of crisis here, interest rates soared and investors continued to withdraw money from Brazil. The International Monetary Fund and senior Clinton Administration officials said they had warned Brazil's President that his Government was unlikely to be able to prevent the currency, the real, from sinking below the exchange rate announced on Wednesday. Page C1. 
 Continued uncertainty about Brazil's prospects contributed to a second day of weak performances on world stock markets, and spread fear that the problems of Latin America's largest economy could soon spread to other countries in a region that accounts for 20 percent of United States exports.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 228.63 points, or 2.45 percent, and major stock markets in Europe and Asia declined slightly. Exchanges throughout Latin America fell sharply.
As Brazilian stocks dropped in Sao Paulo, the nation's financial center, pressure on the real intensified. After a de facto devaluation of more than 8 percent announced on Wednesday, the currency managed to hold steady today at the very top of a new official trading band established by the central bank -- 1.32 to the dollar, compared with 1.21 to the dollar before.
But through the day, nervous consumers and financial speculators tested the new rate, forcing the central bank to use its reserves to defend it. These have shrunk to less than half the $75 billion that Brazil had on hand before Russia devalued and defaulted last summer.
Investors, both foreigners and Brazilians, sent more than $1.25 billion abroad today, bringing the total for the month to about $3.5 billion.
At private currency exchanges, with more reliable supplies of dollars than at many banks, the real traded around 5 percent above the official rate. Middle-class Brazilians with memories of the currency instability that prevailed until recent years sought their traditional refuge in times of crisis -- United States dollars.
"I don't know if we are going to go back to the days when our currency lost value every single day," said Jose Dirceu Amaral Chaves, a salesman who was waiting to buy dollars this afternoon at a currency exchange in Ipanema. "But I need to protect myself and my family if things get worse."
Wednesday's decision to allow the real to slide in value against the dollar came after months of protestations by Brazilian officials that such a step was not only unnecessary but would also damage their efforts to stabilize the economy, the world's eighth largest, after years of high inflation.
But that policy drove interest rates to intolerable levels last fall -- nearly 50 percent -- which in turn dampened consumer purchases and business expansion and sent the country into recession. Interest-rate futures, after declining to 33 percent late last year, rose today to record levels. Contracts maturing in February closed at 71.65 percent, compared with 38.70 percent on Wednesday, while those for March climbed to 59.41 percent from 42.78 percent.
The Government has allowed interest rates to rise so high as part of its strategy to keep the currency stable. Officials have reasoned that the lure of extraordinarily high interest rates would encourage investors to leave their money in accounts in the local currency, rather than deposit billions in dollars overseas for a lower rate of return.
Over the years, though, the Government's defense of the currency made Brazilian exports more expensive than those of many competitors, and made imports artificially cheap, encouraging Brazilians to binge on consumer goods and foreign travel. That, in turn, accelerated the drain of reserves of foreign currency, adding to the pressure for a devaluation of the real.
Brazilian officials say they expect that once investors accept that a realistic exchange rate has been achieved, interest rates will gradually fall. They say that rate spikes like today's are an expectable but short-lived phenomenon, the result of the market testing their resolve to maintain the new exchange rate. They are reluctant to let the currency drop much further because such a step would drastically increase the cost of repaying foreign debt and buying essential imports.
In addition, some foreign officials have feared that uncontrolled devaluation in Brazil could set off destabilizing currency wars in other emerging economies.
Critics, though, argue that Brazil's currency is still overvalued by as much as 30 percent, and that President Francisco Henrique Cardoso and his advisers will only waste additional reserves and prolong the country's crisis by attempting to defend the new rate. Many of those critics maintain that Brazil can only resolve its troubles by allowing the market to determine the currency's true value.
Indeed, rumors that Brazil will soon abandon the new rate altogether and allow the real to float freely were so strong today that the central bank was compelled to issue a statement this afternoon denying that any such plan was under consideration.
At the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, futures contracts for the real reached their maximum daily fluctuation, with contracts for the end of this month hitting 1.396 to the dollar.
Concerns about the viability of the new exchange rate and the likelihood of continued high interest rates led Standard & Poor's today to lower its rating on $58.1 billion of Brazilian foreign debt to BB- from B+. The downgrading, which left Brazil with Venezuela as the lowest-rated countries in South America, was widely publicized on television, radio and other news outlets here. An overall "outlook negative" rating accompanied the assessment.
"The downgrade and negative outlook," the rating service explained in a press release, "reflect the heightened risks to financial recovery posed by yesterday's shift in exchange-rate policy in the context of an unfinished reform agenda and extremely fragile market confidence. Pressure on the exchange rate is unlikely to abate, and net capital flows are expected to remain negative for months."
Some discouraging economic statistics announced by the central bank today also appeared to have fed the stock market plunge. Public-sector debt, for instance, rose by $7 billion in October and now amounts to 40.9 percent of the gross domestic product, a 1.2 percentage point increase in just one month.
Also contributing to the steep decline today, analysts said, was the resignation of Claudio Mauch, a key central bank official, a day after Gustavo Franco, the president of the bank, had stepped down. In his parting remarks, Mr. Mauch said that while one or two of Brazil's more than 200 banks might encounter some problems as a result of the change in exchange-rate policy, "there is nothing that is about to explode."
With the pressure against Brazil and its currency mounting, foreign governments and international lending institutions continued to issue statements of support for Mr. Cardoso and his economic team. In Washington, Enrique Iglesias, president of the Inter-American Development Bank, described international markets' reactions as irrational and praised the Brazilian Government's commitment to economic reform.
"I'm very surprised the markets have not appreciated the immense efforts Brazil is undertaking on fiscal reform," he said. In a separate statement, the bank, one of the principal contributors to the $41.5 billion I.M.F.-led bailout package for Brazil announced in November, argued that Brazil was moving to resolve the problems in its budget and social security system that the rescue plan addresses.
The nation's Congress on Wednesday approved four measures that will add more than $3 billion to Government revenue, helping to reduce the budget deficit and help satisfy the I.M.F. In a speech in Brasilia, the capital, Mr. Cardoso expressed confidence that resistance in Congress and by the governor of the country's second-most-populous state, which contributed to the current crisis, would soon be overcome.
Among ordinary Brazilians, however, confidence has clearly been shaken. "We have to recognize this morning that in a single day we have become nearly 10 percent poorer," Gazeta Mercantil, Brazil's principal business newspaper, glumly concluded in a front-page commentary that appeared in today's issue.

Plot to Oust Castro Lands Amateurs in Jail
The story of some accused anti-Castro saboteurs, assembled from interviews with the five in a Havana prison and the accounts of their relatives and others in Central America, suggests an odd situation. Even as radical Cuban exiles mounted their most intense campaign of violence in years against the Communist Government, their operations appear to have been less cloak-and-dagger than cut-rate and lucky. A8 

U.S. Backs More Iraq Oil
The Clinton Administration, under pressure from members of the United Nations Security Council to find ways to alleviate the suffering of the Iraqi people, has proposed lifting the restrictions on how much oil Iraq can export in order to pay for imports of food and medicine. A10
 
Political Comeback in Turkey
A few months ago, the former Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller was being investigated on corruption accusations so serious that some believed she would not only fall from power but also be imprisoned or forced into exile. Now she is a kingmaker who has broken one potential Prime Minister and made another. A10
 
Political Crisis Muted in Haiti
Opposition leaders in Haiti are accusing President Rene Preval of trying to establish a virtual dictatorship, while the President insists he was merely trying to build a democracy. There has been little outcry over the President's decision to bypass the Parliament and form a government by decree, except from businessmen and opposition politicians. A3
 
Europe Commission Censured
The European Union's Executive Commission survived a censure vote in the European Parliament and averted a crisis by agreeing to investigate allegations of budget fraud and mismanagement. But opponents of the heavily qualified endorsement said the commission is now a discredited lame duck. A3
 
Possible Cease-Fire in Africa
A much feared rebel alliance in Sierra Leone is prepared for a cease-fire, at least a temporary one, rebels and United Nations officials said. It was unclear whether President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah's democratically-elected Government -- or the Nigerian-led coalition force fighting in its defense -- support the proposal. It follows a month of furious rebel attacks against cities and towns. A5
 
Mexican Law Abuses Reported
Human Rights Watch of New York has issued a report claiming that widespread abuses by Mexican police and soldiers continue, despite Government reforms aimed at eradicating the problem. According to the rights group, prosecutors routinely use evidence obtained through torture and illegal detention, and judges continue to make liberal use of such tainted evidence rather than rejecting the cases and punishing the abuses.

Republican Prosecution Begins Impeachment Trial
The impeachment trial of President William Jefferson Clinton began in earnest in the United States Senate, with the Republican prosecution asserting that he should be removed from office because of "egregious and criminal conduct." A1
 
Senate Democrats and Republicans, off the Senate floor, resumed their verbal brawl over whether to call witnesses in Mr. Clinton's trial, imperiling a fragile bipartisan pact. A1
 
Work went on despite the trial, with an occasional halt to view what jaded Washingtonians seemed to be straining to view as history. Hillary Rodham Clinton, who unveiled a program on Mars at the National Air and Space Museum, was not the only person who did not spend the day watching the trial on television. A13
 
A Plan to Raise Cigarette Tax
The Clinton Administration plans to propose a Federal tax increase of 55 cents a pack on cigarettes to help pay for new domestic and military spending programs, White House and congressional officials said. The new tax, if enacted, would raise $8 billion a year over the next five years and would be used to help fund a host of new social initiatives the President has announced recently. A21

Gephardt Poised for Speaker
Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House minority leader and a 12-term Missourian, seems poised to forgo a run for President and try instead to get more Democrats elected to the House next year so that he can become Speaker. A20
 
Florida Won't Finance Train
Plans for a $6.3 billion high-speed train that would link Florida's three major metropolitan areas appeared to be dead after Gov. Jeb Bush pulled out state financing, saying the project posed too much of a financial risk for taxpayers. A20

New York State's new fourth-grade reading test limped toward the end of a nightmarish debut, disrupted by bad weather that closed scores of schools and by continuing questions about distribution and security. B1

U.S. and I.M.F. Warn Brazil Not to Try to Prop Up Currency

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 14

 BODY:
Senior Clinton Administration officials and the International Monetary Fund today warned Brazil's President, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, that his Government was unlikely to hold the devaluation of its currency to 8 percent, and might waste billions of dollars of its precious foreign currency reserves attempting to do so.
The warning came as the Brazilian stock market fell 10 percent before it was shut down, and as currency speculators forced Brazil to spend more than $1 billion -- for the third day running -- in an attempt to keep its currency, the real, from falling further. 
 American officials said they were in constant communication today with officials in other countries in the region, particularly Argentina and Mexico, in an effort to keep Brazil's action from touching off panics that many fear could drag down other Latin American nations.
Today those concerns deepened on Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 228.63 points, or 2.45 percent, partly because of fears that Brazil's problems could spread, hurting both American exports and the earnings of banks that while less exposed to Latin America than they were a few months ago found themselves on the wrong side of a bet about Brazil's prospects of recovery. The Deputy Treasury Secretary, Lawrence H. Summers, a key strategist in the Clinton Administration's efforts to contain the global financial turmoil, postponed a long-scheduled trip to Asia next week.
According to officials in both countries who had been briefed about the high-level telephone conversations between Washington and Brasilia, it was unclear what Mr. Cardoso would do next. But as one official involved in the talks said, "Cardoso was told that the likelihood his current strategy will work is very low."
Mr. Cardoso now finds himself caught between two extraordinarily difficult political choices. He could continue to fight off the speculators who are selling reals, spending billions of dollars from his country's reserves to buy his own country's currency. That would deplete reserves estimated at about $32 billion, a figure that would soon fall to zero if money kept flowing out of Brazil at current rates. Some Brazilian officials, however, are still hoping that they can regain the confidence of investors, convincing them that Mr. Cardoso still has the power to push through painful economic reforms that have touched off enormous political opposition.
Alternatively, Brazil could take the route that the I.M.F. has suggested: abandon the "exchange rate band" that artificially keeps the real from rising or falling past predetermined limits, and let the currency find its own value in the foreign exchange market. The I.M.F. did not propose simply letting the currency spiral into an uncontrolled fall. Instead, it urged the Brazilians to temporarily raise interest rates -- which are already above 50 percent -- as an incentive for investors to keep money in Brazil. The I.M.F. officials told Brazil that in South Korea last year that strategy eventually arrested the fall of the Korean won.
But that could mean the currency would fall 20 percent or more, touching off inflation and a decline in the living standard of Brazil's middle class. Mr. Cardoso has staked his political career -- he just won re-election -- by stabilizing the economy after years of hyper-inflation, and is loath to see his legacy lost.
American officials, who say they were presented with Brazil's decision this week as a fait accompli, insist that they have avoided prescribing a next move to the Brazilians.
"We will not characterize the content of our discussions with Brazil and the I.M.F.," said Howard Schloss, spokesman for Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin. "Other than to say that we have not outlined a detailed set of policy prescriptions to the Brazilians, including exchange rate regimes."
At the same time, Mr. Cardoso spoke at length on Wednesday with Mr. Rubin, and today with the first deputy managing director of the I.M.F., Stanley Fischer. The blunter-speaking Mr. Summers has conducted a series of talks with his Brazilian counterpart, Pedro Malan.
Those conversations take place in the strictest secrecy, and the accounts of them that leak out later are often shaded to fit the self-interest of the leaker.
Brazilian officials, for example, have argued repeatedly in recent days that the devaluation was not their fault, but was forced upon them by currency speculators seeking to exploit delays in the adoption of the reform program. American and I.M.F. officials blame the Brazilians for taking too long to execute their commitments, undermining investors' confidence that Mr. Cardoso has the power to ultimately get them through.
They may both be right. But the events of the last few days also exposed some enormous cracks in the approach taken to keep the Asian economic crisis from washing onto American shores.
Brazil assumed that the $41.5 billion package, which included a $5 billion commitment by the United States, would give it plenty of breathing room. Only a few months ago, officials expressed confidence that speculators would fear attacking the Brazilian currency as long as they knew the United States and the I.M.F. stood behind Brazil's reform efforts.
They were wrong.
For its part, the Clinton Administration bet that Mr. Cardoso, fresh from an election victory, had the power to fulfill his promises. That, too, proved a bad bet -- one reminiscent of the American and I.M.F. roll of the dice last summer in Russia. That bailout, suspended after $4.8 billion was sent to Moscow, was based on the assumption that President Boris N. Yeltsin would convince the Russian Parliament to pass extensive economic reforms. Mr. Cardoso delivered more in Brazil than Mr. Yeltsin delivered in Moscow. But neither did enough to convince the markets.
Brazil's decision on Wednesday to attempt a limited devaluation was an effort to mollify those markets -- bait thrown to the sharks to take them off course. The idea was to give something to investors who have long feared the real is overvalued. But investors concluded that any government willing to devalue once would devalue again. So they took even more money out of the country. And that, in turn, raises the chances that Brazil will have to devalue again. It is a downward cycle that once started is hard to stop.
