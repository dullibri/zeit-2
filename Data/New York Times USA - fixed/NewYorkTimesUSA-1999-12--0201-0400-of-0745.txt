Euro Maintains Big Gain Against the Dollar

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The euro held on to its biggest-ever gains against the dollar as reports from Germany pointed to accelerating growth and a declining unemployment rate in Europe's biggest economy.
Germany's jobless rate in November fell to its lowest in three years while gross domestic product grew seven-tenths of 1 percent in the third quarter, the fastest pace since early 1998. 
 The euro, the single European currency, also found demand as the Hong Kong Monetary Authority increased its euro holdings.
"A combination of buying euros from Hong Kong to fill up reserves" and a stronger economic outlook for Europe helped bolster the euro, said Karl Halligan, chief trader at CIC Bank New York.
The euro was little changed at $1.0255 yesterday from $1.0219 Monday. The dollar fell against the yen to 102.32 yen from 103.03 Monday.
In Germany, 29,000 fewer people were out of work in November as the jobless rate fell to 10.4 percent from 10.5 percent in October, according to the Federal Labor Office. Economists were expecting the report to show joblessness falling by 10,000. Third-quarter growth, meanwhile, rose from a revised one-tenth of 1 percent in the second quarter.
The two reports come a day after German manufacturers showed a bigger-than-expected increase in orders for October, suggesting that expansion in the months ahead for what until recently had been Europe's laggard.
The euro also was bolstered by a Financial Times report that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is increasing the amount of euros in its foreign reserves to 15 percent from 10 percent.
The euro will probably trade between $1.0150 and $1.0350 this week, Mr. Halligan of CIC said.
"I'm slightly bullish on these levels," he said, "given the lack of appetite to pursue new lows before the end of the year."

HEADLINE: With Endorsements, Gore and Bradley Promote Plans on Economy and Health

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE with JAMES DAO 

 BODY:
With Robert E. Rubin, the former Treasury Secretary and one of the architects of the current economic expansion, vouching for his fiscal wisdom and discipline, Vice President Al Gore continued today to attack his opponents as fiscally irresponsible.
Mr. Gore said the budget proposals of former Senator Bill Bradley, his rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the leading Republican, would take "unnecessary risks with our prosperity." 
 "I believe that if the economy ain't broke, then let's make sure that we build on the strength that we have," Mr. Gore said. "Their theme is, if the economy ain't broke, let's break it."
But as Mr. Gore attacked Mr. Bradley's fitness to oversee the economy, Mr. Bradley released statements by two prominent economists who vouched for him.
The two, Paul A. Volcker, a former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, and Henry Kaufman, president of the financial consulting firm of Henry Kaufman & Company, praised Mr. Bradley as understanding the economy, being fiscally prudent and playing a central role in passing the 1986 Tax Reform Act.
Mr. Kaufman also said Mr. Bradley was more honest than Mr. Gore in laying out the cost of his proposals and for refusing to take a pledge against raising taxes.
"Markets rely on trust and truth," Mr. Kaufman said. "Bill Bradley has told the truth about the budget."
Mr. Gore was speaking in an auditorium at New York University Law School to 400 students. The event provided a platform for Mr. Rubin, the former co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Company and now an executive at Citigroup Inc., to endorse Mr. Gore and for that endorsement to resound on Wall Street, where Mr. Bradley and Governor Bush both enjoy substantial support.
Mr. Gore has held open meetings in living rooms and school gymnasiums in New Hampshire that have been casual and personable. Today's, his first such forum in New York, was far more formal, with Mr. Gore standing in a suit on a stage with elected officials like Carl McCall, the State Comptroller, and university officials. His speech focused on the economy, and questions covered a range of domestic issues, from gun control (which he favors) to marijuana's legalization (which he opposes).
Mr. Rubin portrayed Mr. Gore as a full partner with President Clinton in bringing the nation out of its morass of deficits.
"I can tell you," Mr. Rubin said, "after sitting with the vice president in the White House, the Oval Office and the Cabinet room over six and a half years, that he was consistently sound, sensible, practical and willing to fight politically difficult issues with respect to the broad array of economic matters before this administration."
Mr. Gore criticized Mr. Bradley's statements that he could not rule out ever raising taxes to pay for his plan to make health insurance available to most Americans.
The vice president characterized Mr. Bradley as admitting that he might have to raise taxes.
He said Mr. Bradley would spend the budget surplus "mostly to provide subsidies for health coverage to people who already have health coverage, many of them in high income brackets," adding, "That's why he's admitted he may have to raise taxes to pay for his plan."
Mr. Gore went on to say of Mr. Bradley, "To propose a possible tax increase, not because of some contingency related to unknowns in the economy but because of an inability to cover a huge gaping hole in a campaign promise that can't be covered in any other way -- that is unresponsible."
Mr. Gore's spokesman, Chris Lehane, said Mr. Gore had ruled out raising taxes except for some unforeseen disaster. Mr. Gore's 1993 tie-breaking vote in the Senate on the budget, however, included the largest tax increase up to that time in the nation's history.
And Mr. Bradley has pointed out that in 1992, Mr. Clinton refused to pledge not to raise taxes, saying such a pledge would be irresponsible. Mr. Bradley says that he and Mr. Gore have essentially the same view but that Mr. Gore is grossly distorting his.
Mr. Bradley's campaign also announced endorsements from three Democratic members of the House including Pete Stark of California and Jim McDermott of Washington, both considered experts on health care. The third, Representative George Miller of California, worked closely with Mr. Bradley on California water issues in the 1980's.
"The collapse of affordable health insurance for middle and lower income Americans is the problem of the decade, and Bill Bradley has shown more vision and courage in addressing this key issue," Mr. Stark said in a statement.
Mr. Bradley also released new television commercials in New Hampshire and Iowa today praising his plan to make health insurance available to almost all Americans. The 30-second spots are drawn from actual town hall meetings Mr. Bradley held in the two states, and feature the former senator describing the broad outlines to groups of voters.
Mr. Bradley's health plan has been fiercely attacked by Vice President Gore as too expensive and incapable of providing adequate coverage to low-income people.
Finally, the Bradley campaign released a statement accusing Mr. Gore of making false statements about Mr. Bradley's health care plan and position on school vouchers. The news release also asserted that Mr. Gore has exaggerated or obfuscated his own record during the campaign.
For example, the Bradley campaign asserted that while Mr. Gore recently claimed to have long supported the death penalty, he repeatedly voted against it in the Senate.
The Bradley campaign also criticized Mr. Gore for having taken credit in a Time magazine article for being author of the earned-income tax credit, which helps low-income workers. The credit, according to the Bradley campaign, was created in 1975, a year before Mr. Gore was elected to Congress.

HEADLINE: The Big City;
Poverty War: Still No Terms Of Surrender

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY 

 BODY:
THE term "poverty industry" did not sit well with City Councilwoman Juanita E. Watkins at a hearing on homelessness last Friday. After the term was used by Jason A. Turner, the commissioner of the city's Human Resources Administration, she angrily said, "I was not aware that poverty was an industry."
Well, it is. That might not be the best phrase to describe the people and organizations working in it, but neither are the terms commonly used in the press: "advocates for the poor" and "advocates for the homeless." Like "pro-life" and "pro-choice," they are labels adopted by partisans trying to claim the high moral ground. 
 Just as there are no "anti-life" and "anti-choice" forces, there are no "advocates against the poor" or "advocates against the homeless." There are merely people whose notions of helping the poor and the homeless differ from those of, say, the Coalition for the Homeless, which organized Sunday night's protest in Union Square Park, or Housing Works, which occupied Commissioner Turner's office yesterday.
No matter how well-meaning these protesters are, it's misleading to suggest that they are selfless advocates for the homeless. They and their groups, even if they are nonprofit, benefit when more public attention is paid to the homeless, because the results are more private donations and more public spending.
The advocates who are paid with public money to run treatment programs and shelters for the homeless have essentially the same relationship to the homeless as public school teachers do to students: as providers of services to clients. The press doesn't refer to the leaders of the teachers' unions as "advocates for students."
A better term is needed for this week's protesters, but what? Mary Brosnahan, the oft-quoted director of the Coalition for the Homeless, was uncharacteristically without an answer yesterday. "I'm a little sick of 'advocate' myself," she said. "The mayor has said it contemptuously so many times that it's kind of tired. But I've had so little sleep recently that I can't think of anything better at the moment."
"Advocates on homelessness issues" is neutral, but clunky and vague. It would be more descriptive to say "supporters of homeless rights," which would be similar to the approach used in the abortion debate by newspapers (including The New York Times) that avoid "pro-choice" and "pro-life" by referring to the sides as for or against "abortion rights."
"Homeless rights" does describe some of the protesters' demands (no work requirements at shelters, no arrests for sleeping on the street), but the term may not be entirely neutral or accurate. It could be argued that some of the protesters' demands, like the ones for high "living wages" in all jobs and workfare programs, would actually hurt the rights of the homeless by making it harder for them to find work.
THE "poverty industry" isn't neutral either. It's not as insulting as "poverty pimps," the memorable phrase used two decades ago by Mayor Edward I. Koch, but it carries some of the same connotations. It has been used mainly by conservatives, notably Stuart Butler of the Heritage Foundation, an author of a 1987 book, "Out of the Poverty Trap."
Mr. Turner defined the term yesterday (after the protesters had left his office) as "an industry in New York City worth billions of dollars annually that employs an army of enablers." It includes 130,000 social service workers, he said, as well as their professional associations and lobbies.
Nationally, according to estimates by Mr. Butler, the poverty industry consists of 500,000 workers handling $130 billion in antipoverty money. That is enough, he calculated, to raise every family on welfare above the poverty level if the money had gone directly to the poor instead of being filtered through antipoverty programs run by the middle class. "It is the middle-class members of this industry, and not the poor, who truly are most dependent on welfare spending," Mr. Butler wrote.
The "social welfare/poverty complex" was proposed in the 1980's by a conservative scholar, Robert Woodson of the American Enterprise Institute and the Council for a Black Economic Agenda. Some might like the parallel to the "military-industrial complex," but it's a mouthful.
"Social services industry" is simpler, and perhaps this week's protesters could be described with a variant: the "homeless services industry." It's not felicitous, but neither is "advocates for the homeless." At least it's short, relatively neutral and reasonably accurate. Maybe it will do until someone advocates something better.

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES;
An Unlikely Organizer as Cabdrivers Unite

BYLINE: By JOYCE WADLER 

 BODY:
IT has been a long time since there was a face to go with the taxi drivers when they had a gripe, and now, more and more, the face belongs to a 27-year-old woman named Bhairavi Desai, an organizer for the New York Taxi Workers' Alliance. She has never driven a cab, but unlike most of the people she represents, she has had the benefits of a college education in this country. 
 So what's a Rutgers graduate doing with the cabdrivers?
You will forgive her if she has a tendency to speak in a kind of Marxist-labor jargon. (She also giggles if you call her Ms. Desai -- it seems so serious, she says.) It's just on labor that this is the way she is.
"I had been politicized most of my life, by my experience as a poor person and immigrant," Ms. Desai says. "I wanted to work around issues of class and labor, and what is a better community than taxi drivers?"
There are about 40,000 yellow-cab drivers in New York City, and they have no union. Nor have they had a unified voice. But lately this has been changing, and much of the credit is given to Bhairavi Desai (pronounced BAY-rah-vee Dah-SIGH) and the 2,000-member alliance.
Ms. Desai, in communal spirit, calls herself merely an organizer, but she has been organizing well. It was the alliance, with another group, the United Yellow Cab Company, that helped mount the cabbies' 24-hour work stoppage last year after the mayor introduced stiff penalties against drivers. More recently, the group has been responding to the complaint of the actor Danny Glover that five cabbies passed him by because he is black.
Ms. Desai, adding her quiet voice to a forum on the matter at Pace University last weekend, said that many cabbies turned down fares to the boroughs outside Manhattan because they thought they could earn more money in Manhattan. She also added, "None of this justifies people being denied services."
Does she deny that there is racism among cab drivers? "The taxi industry does not exist in a vacuum," Ms. Desai says at the alliance office on West 27th Street. "It's reflective of a larger society itself."
If, by the way, you are one of those people who fret about labor leaders' having fat paychecks, you will be cheered by Ms. Desai. The labor leader's winter coat is a double hand-me-down: a cousin gave it to Ms. Desai's mother, who works in a factory. Ms. Desai's salary is $1,500 a month. She lives in Jersey City, where her rent is $550.
As for her background, Ms. Desai was born in Gujarat, India, near Bombay, and concerns about social justice were a family matter. Her grandmother told Ms. Desai and her two older brothers stories of being arrested in the fight for independence for India; Ms. Desai's father was a lawyer, who also "fought for the rights of the underprivileged."
WHEN Ms. Desai was 6 the family moved to the United States, settling in Harrison, N.J.
"It was Reaganomics," Ms. Desai says dryly, putting her childhood in an eco-political frame. "It was the end of affirmative action, but it wasn't the end of racism. My father ended up buying a small grocery store; my mother got factory work. To me it really is a powerful image, my mother very new to America, kind of hitting the streets with my brother, going from factory to factory filling out applications.
"There's a lie about immigrants in America: You don't get handed jobs; you work very hard to find jobs. A grocery store is almost the same as a taxi; you work 70 to 80 hours a week. We were fortunate, because the store was almost like in the back of our apartment and there was a little bell set up, so if my father needed help he could ring a bell and my brothers and I would come out and help."
That's almost Pavlovian, Ms. Desai is told -- as if she had been programmed to help people.
"It's also the nature of immigrant life in America," Ms. Desai says. "Labor becomes a family activity. I think it's much more revealing of economic need than of individual personality."
Marx might agree, but Freud would not.
"That's probably why I'm much more drawn to Marx than to Freud," Ms. Desai says.
Ms. Desai realized just how poor her family was when she applied for college aid -- they were living below the poverty level. She graduated from Rutgers University in 1994 with a degree in women's studies, then worked with battered women.
At 23, Ms. Desai became involved with the Committee Against Anti-Asian violence, which was organizing a group in New York called the Lease Drivers Coalition. She caught drivers during their shift changes or breaks, at garages and at restaurant hangouts; she asked about their concerns, followed up with phone calls.
In August 1997, the group organized a demonstration of 2,000 yellow cabs at 14th Street and Avenue D -- a move, Ms. Desai said, that brought them to a bargaining position with the Taxi and Limousine Commission. In February 1998, Ms. Desai and several other organizers, seeking more independence, created the New York Taxi Workers' Alliance.
Why, again, is this woman whose parents sacrificed for her to have a better life, working like, well, a taxi driver? "I believe it's not just my parents that put me into college," she says. "It's the sacrifice of the working men and women in the country, of the immigrants in this country. I think I owe them something in return."

HEADLINE: Deep Poverty and Illness Found Among Homeless

BYLINE: By NINA BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
A sweeping national study of homeless people served by shelters, soup kitchens and other programs has found that almost half were in their first episode of homelessness, 44 percent had worked at least part time in the previous month and 42 percent said that what they needed more than anything was help finding a job.
But the study, being released today and based on Census Bureau surveys in 1995 and 1996 and the most comprehensive study of homelessness ever, also found that over all, the homeless were deeply impoverished and most were ill. Two-thirds were suffering from chronic or infectious diseases, not counting AIDS, 55 percent lacked health insurance, and 39 percent had signs of mental illness. Twenty-seven percent reported a childhood history of foster care or institutional placement. 
 "This is a definitive description of what we're dealing with when we talk about the quote, unquote, homeless," Andrew M. Cuomo, secretary of Housing and Urban Development, said yesterday in discussing the study, which was based on interviews with 12,000 service providers and 4,000 homeless clients. "There is no simple solution."
Despite their handicaps, 60 percent of the homeless living alone and 76 percent of those living in families successfully left shelters for permanent housing when they received the services they needed, including housing subsidies, health care, substance-abuse treatment, education and job training, according to the study's surveys of representatives of about 40,000 programs that serve the homeless nationwide.
While the study did not offer an estimate of the overall homeless population, its 600 pages of statistics included figures showing that an estimated 470,000 homeless people sheltered on an average night in February 1996 were only a quarter of the people who were homeless at any one time during the year. The previous national survey, done in 1987, estimated the number of homeless people, including those in the streets, at 500,000 to 600,000 on any night.
The study took three years to complete because it required the collection and analysis of an extraordinary amount of data and involved 12 federal agencies, officials said.
Experts on homelessness, including Martha Burt, the director of social service research at the Urban Institute, which prepared the report to be released by housing department today, cautioned that like any point-in-time snapshot this survey over-represented the more chronically homeless, who were more likely to be mentally ill or addicted to drugs, and under-represented the people who became homeless sporadically for economic reasons.
"They are bookends," Mr. Cuomo agreed. "You have a pent-up need for affordable housing and you have populations with underlying problems. They are both driving the system."
At a time when cities are using law enforcement to try to move homeless people out of public places, Mr. Cuomo added, the study underlines that punitive ordinances and police crackdowns will not work.
"You need outreach to get people off the street -- not a police officer with handcuffs," he said. "You need transitional services as a second step, and then by definition you need the third step, which is permanent housing."
Among the surprises in the study was that while New York, Los Angeles and other larger cities provided the most beds for the homeless, they helped a smaller portion of their poor residents than some smaller cities like Minneapolis, San Francisco and St. Louis.
Despite the booming economy, Ms. Burt said, there is no reason to believe the picture drawn by the study has changed significantly. The poverty rate remains almost the same, and other Housing Department studies show that rising rents and a steep decline in housing subsidies have left 5.3 million poor families in housing that was unaffordable or severely substandard, a record number.
"The economy is better but we are also cutting way back on the safety net," Ms. Burt said. "This is poverty-related as well as disability-related. Lots of people have problems; we have alcoholic senators -- they're not homeless."
Homeless people are among the poorest in the nation, with incomes averaging half the federal poverty level. Forty percent of those surveyed said they went without food one or more days in the previous month, compared with 3 percent of other poor Americans. Almost a third of homeless clients surveyed said they had slept on the streets or in other places not meant for habitation within the week before the survey. Yet, those in central cities were better off than their counterparts surveyed in 1987, mainly because they were more likely to have government benefits like public assistance and food stamps.
"The fact that most of these folks don't have Medicaid is a pretty damning statistic," said Dennis P. Culhane, a professor of social welfare policy at the University of Pennsylvania.
The rates of mental illness were unchanged since the 1987 survey, a fact, Mr. Culhane added, that suggests known solutions to the homelessness of the disabled -- treatment and supportive, permanent housing -- are not being fully used.
The survey shows the strengths of the expanded system of homeless services, largely provided by nonprofit and religious-based charities financed by the government, Mr. Culhane said, but also shows the limits of that approach.
Exploring the suspicion in many towns that the homeless come from somewhere else, the study found that 29 percent of homeless families and 46 percent of single homeless clients said they were not living in the same place where they became homeless. In all cases, Ms. Burt said, they had moved from a smaller to larger places.
Major reasons included the lack of jobs and affordable housing in the place they left, and the presence of relatives or friends and job possibilities in the city where they were interviewed, as well as the availability of shelters and other services.
Serious childhood traumas were common among the homeless people surveyed, the study found, with 25 percent reporting childhood abuse, 33 percent having run away from home and 21 percent having experienced homelessness as children.
"I think what you also see in this report is the failure of our primary, early intervention system," Mr. Cuomo said. "You are creating tomorrow's homeless today."

Senseless in Seattle II

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
Now that the Seattle World Trade Organization summit meeting is over, we can ask: Was it a turning point, or just an exclamation point? That depends entirely on how the protesters and governments interpret Seattle. Here is my own guide:
What the serious protesters got right: My environmentalist allies say my criticism of the protesters in Seattle was too broad-brush. There were some serious groups there raising serious points, particularly the notion that the W.T.O. has no need or right to be so secretive. If it is deciding that a U.S. law banning tuna caught in nets that also catch dolphins is a trade barrier, the W.T.O. should at least allow environmentalists to file a brief or meet with judges. The W.T.O. can't promote open trade by ruling in the dark. It would enhance its own legitimacy if it opened up. 
What the protesters got wrong: The biggest negative fallout from Seattle is the way it smeared free trade. I fear that politicians all over America will look at Seattle and say, "Wow, if that's what you get when you support free trade, I'm hiding."
President Clinton has been a real stand-up guy on free trade -- until last week. I know in an election year he has to tip his hat to the A.F.L.-C.I.O. But we can't afford the full-body kowtow. Mr. Clinton effectively kidnapped the Democratic Party seven years ago, moved it into the Republican economic agenda -- including free trade, Nafta and the W.T.O. for China -- while holding onto much of the Democrats' social agenda. But his tacit ally in this was Newt Gingrich. As long as the "evil Newt" was out there with his extreme agenda, Mr. Clinton was able to hold the Democrats behind him. But what you saw in Seattle is what the activist base of the Democratic Party looks like -- without the fear of Newt. It is a wildly diverse coalition that, without strong leadership from the top of the Democratic Party, could really pull it over a cliff on free trade.
Where we go from here: "It's amazing how caught up some activists are in the old world," says Paul Gilding, the former head of Greenpeace who now advises multinationals on sustainable development. "The old model is you go into the streets, raise the outrage of the community, get the government to pass a law, the companies resist, eventually a compromise is reached and in five years things change."
The groups making the biggest difference today are those working with multinationals and consumers -- showing the companies how they can be both green and profitable, while making clear to them that if they don't upgrade their environmental and labor practices, the activist community will mount a campaign against them through the Internet and consumers all over the world. "The smart activists," says Mr. Gilding, "understand that the market, and global integration, is now king, and this can be a great boon to environmentalists and a great threat to big companies."
Sure, the W.T.O. ruled against the U.S. laws banning tuna caught in nets that also catch dolphins. But I just went to my Giant supermarket and checked every can of tuna. They all said: "Dolphin safe." Now how could that be? Because the smart activists ignored the W.T.O. ruling, mobilized consumers to pressure the tuna companies, the tuna companies pressured the fishermen and Flipper got saved. That's how you change the world. If we didn't have free trade with Mexican fishermen, would we have been able to pressure them into using dolphin-safe nets on the tuna they sell us? Not a chance. "Our decision to go dolphin safe was purely based on consumer feedback," Michael Mullen, spokesman for StarKist tuna, told me. "We get about 1,000 calls and 300 consumer e-mails a week."
Laws and regulations protecting workers, water and trees still matter. My argument is simply that the best way to strengthen those laws, and to get developing countries to abide by them, is by activists mobilizing consumers, pressuring companies and using free trade -- not choking it.
But too many unions and activists want the quick fix for globalization: just throw up some walls and tell everyone else how to live. There was a country that tried that. It guaranteed everyone's job, maintained a protected market and told everyone else how to live. It was called the Soviet Union. Didn't work out so well. In the end it probably did more damage to its environment and workers than any country in history.

HEADLINE: The Powerful Idea of Human Rights

 BODY:
A great flowering of the ideal of universal human rights has taken place in the last 50 years, a blink of time in a millennium. It is among the most important political legacies of this century. Despite the persistence of state-sponsored repression and genocidal conflict, the belief that individuals have a claim to basic rights and dignities is being embraced by ordinary citizens on every continent. Freedom of speech and assembly, freedom from slavery, torture and arbitrary arrest, and the right to equality under the law as common values are still quite new in many parts of the world. But leaders who violate these principles now face international exposure, sanctions and even outside intervention, as Slobodan Milosevic discovered this year.
The past 30 years have seen the birth of hundreds of human rights organizations that give voice to aspirations of freedom and equality. These groups have worked to expose criminal regimes and help their victims. Many groups have become political forces in their own right, joining together to push for initiatives such as banning land mines. 
 The movement grew out of the horrors of World War II and the brutal tyrannies that darkened the rest of the 20th century. But its roots can be traced to the Greek Stoics, who believed in universal natural laws; the Romans, who refined concepts on the rule of law; and the Enlightenment philosophers, who believed that freedom was a natural condition and that the purpose of government was to serve and protect citizens. In this millennium, documents like Magna Carta of 1215, the English Bill of Rights of 1689, the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen of 1789, and the American Constitution of 1787 and the Bill of Rights of 1791 advanced the universality of human rights.
Yet even in Western cultures where these notions of rights first developed, the progress of freedom took centuries. During the first half of the millennium, slavery was a common condition in Europe. In feudalism, only those wealthy enough to own land and arms enjoyed any semblance of freedom. In some 11th-century documents, those who were called "free" were hereditarily bound to their masters' land and transferred like livestock, with no rights to own or inherit property or even marry without a master's consent.
In 15th-century Genoa, a census counted more than 2,000 slaves in city households. In 1860 more than half the population of South Carolina was in slavery, and government-sanctioned racial discrimination existed in America for 100 years more. The struggle for women's suffrage across Europe and America did not end until after World War I.
Well into this century, human rights were not accepted as a matter for international discourse. The Covenant of the League of Nations of 1919, for example, did not address human rights generally. Earlier international agreements dealt with certain protections for victims of war, but not with how governments treated their own citizens.
The enormity of the Nazi atrocities forced the world to consider human rights as a concern of international law. The Nuremberg Principles established the authority of the international community to prosecute crimes committed by a state against its own people. In 1948 the United Nations approved the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a document that boldly proclaimed that recognition of "the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world." Its 30 articles catalogue civil, political, economic and social rights.
In just a few decades the vision of that document, which is not a treaty but a "common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations," has become part of the dialogue among nations. Its principles were incorporated in the 1975 Helsinki Accords, which subjected human rights abuses in the former Soviet bloc to closer scrutiny. It remains the foundation of the global human rights movement, used by citizens from diverse cultures to express their hopes to the world.
This Friday marks the 51st anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration. The human rights movement is younger in age than the oldest baby boomers, and still embattled in many nations. In the 1990's the world has witnessed the horror of genocide in Rwanda and the use of rape and torture as methods of war in the former Yugoslavia. The enforcement of human rights against rogue regimes, and even in nations that have adopted these principles, remains a struggle.
But the impact of the idea is undeniable. Human rights ideals have been accepted by people around the globe, whether they are students seeking democratic reform in China or women demanding equal protection under law in Pakistan. This development could not have been imagined at the start of the millennium or even this century. It offers a promise that could prove as important as the great revolutions of the preceding centuries.

HEADLINE: Russia Reacts Angrily Over Western Criticism on Chechnya

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 7

 BODY:
Russian officials reacted angrily today to Western condemnation of their military tactics in Chechnya, warning that threats to impose sanctions or interrupt aid are unacceptable.
Several officials insisted that Russia was feeling the effects of the criticism through a decision by the International Monetary Fund to postpone the delivery of a $640 million credit. 
 "It is clear that in this case political considerations were crucial in the decision making," First Deputy Prime Minister Viktor B. Khristenko said. "The I.M.F.'s status as a nonpolitical organization is in question."
The Russian military's ultimatum to residents of Grozny, the Chechen capital, has provoked a torrent of criticism in Western capitals. In Britain, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said aid from the European Union to Russia would be reviewed next week at a meeting if the Russian military did not observe "basic humanitarian norms."
From Washington, President Clinton has warned Moscow that it will pay "a heavy price" if it continues killing civilians.
In Moscow, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry rejected the warnings. "The language of economic sanctions and diktat is unacceptable," the spokesman said, "all the more so when it concerns the issue of Russia's territorial integrity and the fight against terrorism."
Western leaders and diplomats do not challenge Russia's right to protect its territory against the Chechen separatists, and the Western officials have expressed support for Moscow's efforts to suppress guerrillas whose attacks on a neighboring Russian region ignited the latest conflict.
But the Westerners have been increasingly outraged by what the NATO Secretary General, Lord George Robinson, called Russia's hamfisted tactics in a war that has caused uncounted civilian deaths and a chaotic exodus of more than 200,000 refugees. Lord Robertson said the war was counterproductive and unacceptable internationally.
Coming on the heels of Western indignation over Russian financial scandals, the criticism casts a pall over relations with the West, and several Russian commentators are warning of a new cold war.
Russia's economic dependence is a source of bitterness, too. It has been eagerly awaiting the latest credits from the I.M.F. Russia has pledged to use the money simply to offset outstanding debts to the fund. Without the money, Russia would have to cut back on its spending and dip into reserves of hard currency. Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin, speaking to reporters today, said he was not convinced that the lenders' reasons were not political. "The formal pretext is a supposed failure to implement certain obligations," he said. "We do not think so."

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
I.M.F. Wants Reform Laws
 (By The New York Times), WASHINGTON, Dec. 7 -- The International Monetary Fund explained today that it was continuing to delay a $640 million loan payment to Russia because Moscow had failed to meet the necessary economic benchmarks.
The managing director of the fund, Michel Camdessus, cited five reform goals the Russians had not met, including the Parliament's failure to adopt certain bankruptcy laws or to increase the rate of cash collection for electricity, heating, natural gas and rail-freight services.
Senior Clinton administration officials said although the delay was justified on economic grounds, efforts to protest Moscow's campaign against Chechnya loomed over the loan process. The administration felt increasing pressure to come forward with more direct condemnation of Moscow. European foreign ministers said on Monday that they would seek ways to block loans from international financial organizations.
The administration has been steadfast in public that it would not support curbing economic aid, insisting that such action would weaken Russia and that such a move was not in the interests of the United States.
Administration officials have also expressed concerns about politicizing loans from the International Monetary Fund and using them to express concern about actions in Chechnya. But as Russia flaunted Western advice to halt its military submission of Chechnya, there were growing divisions in the administration and the International Monetary Fund on whether to use a multilateral loan for political reasons, a senior administration official said.
"The administration position on the loan right now is that it is not related to Chechnya," the official said, and that Russia "has failed to meet the conditions. Any other considerations are moot until they meet the conditions."

HEADLINE: Seattle Police Chief Resigns in Aftermath of Protests

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Dec. 7

 BODY:
Amid continuing criticism over the police department's handling of the protests last week in Seattle that eclipsed the World Trade Organization meeting here, the city's police chief announced today that he would resign.
The chief, Norm Stamper, said he wished to "depoliticize" the investigations that are under way into police preparations for the global trade talks, which drew 35,000 protesters downtown. The demonstrations quickly turned into a tumultuous affair, televised worldwide, in which the police sprayed tear gas and rubber pellets at many peaceful protesters along police lines near the meeting but failed to stop the window-smashing and looting by a relatively small group of vandals less than a block away. The National Guard was called in to help restore order. 
 In his resignation letter to Mayor Paul Schell, Mr. Stamper praised his officers for the "restraint, discipline, perseverance and incredible courage" he said they showed in the face of the protests, and noted that there were no deaths or serious injuries reported in nearly a week of unrest.
But the police and Mr. Schell have been hit by complaints from all sides: from protesters and residents of neighborhoods in and around downtown who say the tear gas, pepper spray and rubber pellets they endured were wildly inappropriate; by merchants who say the vandalism caused at least $3 million in damages and much more than that in lost holiday sales, and even from some police officers, who have spoken up to assert that the department was completely unprepared.
In handing in his resignation, effective in March, Mr. Stamper may take a bit of political heat off Mr. Schell, although Mr. Schell made a point of dismissing suggestions that he had sought or forced the move.
"The decision was Norm's, and Norm's alone," Mr. Schell said at a news conference this morning, adding that he had tried to talk the chief out of resigning. But the mayor's critics, including some City Council members, quickly cast the resignation as an effort to make Mr. Stamper the scapegoat.
And the resignation may be only the beginning of the political fallout from an event that was intended to showcase Seattle as a world-class city and friend to both free speech and free trade. Mr. Schell, a Democrat up for re-election in 2001, turned back questions this morning about whether he himself might resign.
"I am not going to step down," he declared.
Mr. Schell, a former director of community development and dean of the University of Washington's school of architecture and urban planning, had wanted to provide the protesters a broad forum to make their points, and he and Mr. Stamper had spent months working with protest leaders to ensure peace.
The mayor spoke of Seattle offering a model of "constructive debate" on trade issues, and, as the protests got out of hand, he appeared stunned and saddened, saying: "This administration has people who marched in the 1960's. The last thing I wanted was to be mayor of a city that called in the National Guard."
For that approach, he has certainly drawn praise, and one snap poll last week by a local television station, KOMO-TV, the ABC affiliate here, found that 26 percent of Seattleites interviewed said they had a higher opinion of the mayor at the end of the week than at the beginning.
But in the main, he has been roundly criticized for the way the city prepared for and handled the protests. The City Council is opening hearings into the events, which will be open to protesters, residents, merchants, police officers and anyone else who wants to testify.
At least two civil-rights groups, the N.A.A.C.P. and the local chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, are calling for investigations.
There was something of a subtext to the chain of events leading to the decision by Mr. Stamper, 55, to resign after nearly six years as head of the force. While widely praised in some quarters of this relatively liberal city for his outreach efforts, he was deeply unpopular with many conservative political leaders and with some police officers.
Half a year after taking over in 1994, he upset some officers when he wore his uniform in a gay-pride parade but forbade his officers from wearing theirs at a "March for Jesus" the same weekend.
In 1996, when one of his officers shot and killed an unarmed black man during a domestic-violence dispute, Mr. Stamper apologized at a community meeting organized by black leaders for what he termed a "wrongful death." Later, though, he told reporters he supported an inquest jury's conclusion that the shooting had been accidental.
In 1998, he told a columnist for The Seattle Post-Intelligencer that as a young police officer in San Diego, he had beaten up gays and used racial slurs to harass members of minority groups. "Gay bashing was not only acceptable, it was more or less required," he said, and he added that he had "regularly jacked around young people and people of color."
While he expressed deep remorse for those actions and gained some praise for his candor, many police officers here and elsewhere were outraged, believing Mr. Stamper had branded them all racists and gay-bashers. After the column appeared, Mr. Stamper interrupted a vacation to apologize to veteran officers.
And most recently, Mr. Stamper's department was weathering a scandal over its failure to unearth details about a case in which a veteran homicide detective was suspected of stealing $10,000 from a crime scene and his sergeant was accused of covering up the crime. (A first trial of the detective ended in a hung jury.)
Mr. Stamper alluded to his roller-coaster history in his letter to Mr. Schell, saying, "Although my personal beliefs and political views have often been at odds with many of my colleagues, I've managed to love almost every moment of my career."
Still, Mr. Stamper's action today was clearly linked to the handling of last week's protests.
While merchants and many protesters were furious, so were police officers. Some have already talked of suing the city, and this morning the police union president, Mike Edwards, said that many officers had had deficient equipment and forced to spend as much as 20 hours straight on the police lines without food or other support.
Brett Smith, a 10-year veteran of the force, complained last week to the Post-Intelligencer that the department had been completely unprepared, despite warnings of a flood of protesters.
"It seemed like they closed their eyes and said, 'I hope nothing happens,' " he told the newspaper, which also reported news of Mr. Stamper's impending resignation in this morning's edition, hours before the mayor made it official.
Mr. Stamper said he had intended to resign next year anyway. "I think it's natural for people to say, 'Well of course the police chief is going to say this or say that, do this or do that because he wants to keep his job,' " he said at the news conference. "What I've said is, I'm not abandoning my job, I'm retiring from it."
Mr. Schell said that he had no intention of his leaving his job.
"The whole community's hurting, I'm hurting," the mayor said. "And I think that it's time to understand what happened, what can we learn from it as a community. And before we start assigning guilt, the first step is, let's get the facts. All of us, together. And then make our conclusions."

IMC GLOBAL CUTTING 850 JOBS AND TAKE MAJOR CHARGES

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
IMC Global Inc., one of the world's biggest fertilizer companies, said yesterday that it would cut 850 jobs, or 9.7 percent of its work force, and take charges of $825 million in the fourth quarter as it tries to recover from a weak North American farm economy and lower phosphate prices. The company expects a charge of $6.81 a share in the quarter once a partner in joint ventures pays its part of the charges. The job cuts from IMC's 8,800 workers account for about half of the $70 million, or 40 cents a share, IMC expects to save annually. IMC, based in Northbrook, Ill., which had $2.7 billion in 1998 sales, warned last month that it would take a big fourth-quarter charge.

HEADLINE: McCain Calls for Overhaul Of National Security Policy

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL

 BODY:
Senator John McCain called yesterday for the United States to adjust its national security policy to the post-cold-war era by rebuilding its military to meet the new threats posed by rogue states, terrorists and ethnic conflicts.
In a speech setting out his military policy, Mr. McCain, the Arizona senator who is seeking the Republican presidential nomination, outlined steps that he said were necessary to meet the security challenges of the new millennium. His proposals included a pay increase for the military, deployment of a national missile defense system and elimination of outmoded weapons systems. 
 "Today, my friends, we must face a harsh and compelling reality," Mr. McCain said last night after receiving an annual freedom award at the U.S.S. Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum in Manhattan. "In strategy, personnel and procurement -- the total package that defines America's ability to defend itself -- the United States does not have the modern force and defense posture we must have to meet the threats to America's interests and values in the 21st century."
As a young naval aviator, Mr. McCain served on the Intrepid.
In a sharp criticism of the Clinton administration's military policy, Mr. McCain also said: "It's time to end the disingenuous practice of stating that we have a two-war strategy when we are paying for only a one-war military. Either we must change our strategy -- and accept the risks -- or we must properly fund and structure our military."
Mr. McCain, who was a prisoner of war in North Vietnam for five and a half years and was in the Navy for 22 years, set out proposals to increase military morale and to reshape the nation's armed forces for challenges that he said often required lighter, more flexible special forces instead of a conventional military geared toward war in Central Europe.
He called for a 3 percent-a-year pay increase for military personnel across three years and the elimination of federal taxes on military personnel based overseas. Aides said the raise would cost $4.3 billion over three years, while the tax proposal would cost $800 million a year.
Mr. McCain also said he could identify ways to save $20 billion in Pentagon spending through steps like eliminating pork barrel spending, closing unneeded bases, privatizing some support and maintenance functions and eliminating "Buy America" restrictions. In New Hampshire, where he previewed some of his remarks before a Rotary Club, Mr. McCain listed the C-130 aircraft, the B-2 bomber and the Seawolf submarine as examples of weapons systems that were no longer necessary.
The senator's aides said savings across all these areas would come close to offsetting Mr. McCain's military spending proposals.
The address on national security policy was the first of several speeches Mr. McCain plans over the next few weeks on health care, the environment and Social Security. Polls show the senator running neck and neck with Gov. George W. Bush of Texas in the first primary state, New Hampshire.
The senator has been using his gripping personal story and his expertise in foreign policy to set himself apart from Mr. Bush. But his military policy was not strikingly different from Mr. Bush's own call in September for the nation to adapt to new security challenges in the aftermath of the cold war.
Mr. McCain said the threats to the nation's strategic interests had evolved since the cold war, although he still cited as potential threats the political and economic chaos in Russia and China's growing military and economic might. He said the United States faced national security challenges from nationalist and ethnic conflicts, from the possibility of attacks on vital links like computer grids, from the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in rogue states and from terrorism.
By the coming decade, he said, the United States could face "a fundamentally new strategic situation: a rogue state such as Iraq or North Korea, with the ability, in time of crisis to use nuclear blackmail against an American president." He called for a policy of "rogue state rollback," not simply to contain such governments but to drive them from power by helping opposition groups.
Mr. McCain said a system to shield against ballistic missiles was an "indispensable defense" against rogue states. As president, he said, he would try to negotiate a pact with Russia to alter the 1972 ABM treaty with the Soviet Union to allow such a missile defense shield. But if Russia does not agree, he said, "I will withdraw from a treaty that has become a relic of the cold war if it cannot be made relevant to our national security needs."
He said, "Our cold war pledge to remain defenseless against missile attack is the single greatest incentive for rogue statue proliferation."
Mr. Bush has made a similar pledge to break out of the treaty if Russia does not agree to make changes. And the Clinton administration, in softer terms, has raised the possibility.
Mr. McCain said the Pentagon needed to reassess the goals and mission of each of the nation's military services for a time when the nation's forces needed to be smaller, more automated and easier to deploy. Re-evaluating readiness will be a waste if it is intended only to hide a lack of political will to provide a superpower defense for a superpower's commitments, he said. "We should never ask how much defense we can afford, my friends," he said.
Blaming both President Clinton and the Republican-controlled Congress, Mr. McCain issued a scathing critique of current military readiness. He said that during the war in Kosovo last spring, the Army was "unable to deploy its premier Apache helicopter forces in time to play a vital role." He also noted that the the Air Force's inventory of air-launched cruise missiles fell to 70 from the 1,000 level the Pentagon says it needs to handle two major theater wars.
And he said reductions in the United States' carrier fleet "could have resulted in a calamity in the Pacific" earlier this year when deployments in Kosovo and the Persian Gulf left "no carrier battle groups in East Asia's waters, where events in the Straits of Taiwan and on the Korean Peninsula could have become world threatening crises."
 
In His Own Words: JOHN McCAIN
 
Remarks about defense policy prepared for delivery here last night aboard the aircraft carrier Intrepid:
"I have spoken before about the unique 'unipolar moment' in world affairs for the United States and the necessity to extend this period of American pre-eminence for as long as we possibly can. In a remarkably changed world, and on the eve of the next American century, our core strategic interests, like our founding ideals, remain constant: protecting our homeland and hemisphere from external threats; preventing the domination of Europe by a single power; strengthening our alliances; securing access to energy resources; and sustaining stability in the Pacific Rim. With the end of the cold war, the threats to our strategic interests have evolved or, at least, their ranking as priority threats has been reordered.
 In addition to the potential threats posed by continued political and economic chaos in Russia, and China's growing economic and military strength, there are other immediate threats to our national security that the next administration must face. Recently, I described these four threats in detail.
First, violent expressions of nationalist and ethnic rivalries;
Second, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to rogue states and potential adversaries;
Third, information warfare such as an attack on our private sector's computer grids that cause critical failures in vital services that we take for granted. If we do not more effectively guard our communications, including the Internet -- our powerful economic engine -- utilities, transportation, financial systems, and other essential services, tiny fiber optic threads might carry viruses as incapacitating as an armed attack.
Fourth, and directly connected to cyberwarfare and proliferation, terrorism.
There is a common identity to many of these threats. It should surprise no one that the most viciously antidemocratic regimes, the rogue states, are the chief proliferators; the major exporters of terrorism; the main instigators of regional and ethnic conflicts. From the Persian Gulf to the Korean Peninsula to the Balkans, rogue states are the main threat to peace and freedom, and they require a strong, comprehensive policy response, a policy of 'rogue state rollback.'
We must use both public and private diplomacy, targeted economic measures, and military assistance to aid forces seeking freedom from rogue regimes. But we must be prepared to back up these measures with American military force when the continued existence of such rogue states threatens America's interests and values. And, most importantly, state sponsors of terrorism must know not the specifics of our response, but the certainty that it will be swift and sure."

HEADLINE: Big Changes Are Planned In Zoning Law

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
The Giuliani administration is to submit the city's most sweeping revision of its zoning laws in 40 years to the City Planning Commission and the City Council today. If approved, the new rules will impose the first broad limits on the height of new buildings in New York City.
In an interview, Joseph B. Rose, the planning commissioner, said the zoning changes would eliminate or simplify myriad zoning incentives and set height limits in most neighborhoods based on the scale of existing development. 
 First proposed by Mr. Rose in April, the revisions will undergo a series of hearings and environmental studies before being submitted to the City Council for a vote in the spring. Mr. Rose said he hoped the revisions would become law by June, providing the first major change in the rules and philosophy that have guided development in the city since its current zoning code was adopted in 1961.
"With each successive boom in the city's real estate economy, developers use the opportunities that remain in the 1961 zoning code to build taller and bigger buildings," an introduction to the 110-page zoning proposal said.
"Now, more than ever, reforms are needed to rebalance zoning regulation and development economics."
The proposal is being submitted at the same time that Donald J. Trump is building a 70-story apartment tower, which will rise more than 800 feet, across First Avenue from the United Nations Building, which is 500 feet tall. The Trump building has provoked a torrent of lawsuits and complaints.
Mr. Trump has already obtained city permits for his project, but Mr. Rose said the tower provided an example of how the current zoning laws can be exploited.
"The Trump situation highlights a public process that is totally confusing and unpredictable, where nobody, from your neighbor to the secretary-general of the United Nations, can be certain what will be built next door," Mr. Rose said.
If the proposed zoning rules had been in effect when Mr. Trump applied for his building permit, he would have been limited to 495 feet, Mr. Rose added. Buildings in residential neighborhoods of brownstones and small two-family homes would in many cases be limited to less than 70 feet in height.
Under the proposal, the core of Midtown Manhattan and the most heavily developed blocks of the Wall Street financial district and downtown Brooklyn would be excluded from the new rules. Provisions would also be made to exclude a section of Long Island City if it continues to attract large-scale commercial development.
But elsewhere in the city, the zoning revisions are intended to radically alter what experts have long called the "tower in the park" approach to urban planning. Under that approach, tall, narrow buildings have been encouraged as a trade-off for requiring builders to provide open space at ground level and to allow light and air to flow through their spires.
The revisions seem certain to provoke opposition, and perhaps lawsuits, from some in the real estate industry.
Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York, an industry group, said yesterday that he "agreed with the concept of predictability" that would be provided by the new rules. But while he said most developers would "accept reasonable height limits," he added that there might be "disagreement about the numbers in some categories."
The proposed rules would set a wide variety of height limits for commercial and residential structures across the city.
Mr. Rose said the overall size of buildings, even those built on a vast scale in Manhattan, would not be affected. Although height would be limited, developers could compensate by making their buildings wider or bulkier.
Since the broad outlines of Mr. Rose's plan were released in April, several civic and urban planning groups have described them as overdue, pointing to the confused amalgam of rules that now apply, allowing such things as neglected, little-used public plazas and new buildings that rise to heights far out of character with their surrounding structures.
Ken Barwick, president of the Municipal Arts Society, a group that has analyzed the effect of New York City zoning since the city's first zoning laws were adopted in 1916, said yesterday that Mr. Rose "should be applauded for taking on a zoning code that we have all known to be misconceived for 40 years."

HEADLINE: REVIEW;
Razzle-Dazzle Look at the Civil War on Disc

BYLINE: By DAVID M. OSHINSKY; David M. Oshinsky is chairman of the history department at Rutgers.

 BODY:

THE CIVIL WAR EXPERIENCE
(SouthPeak Interactive; $40; CD-ROM for Windows 95 and 98.)
FROM almost every perspective -- political, economic, moral, military -- the Civil War remains the defining moment in our history. More than 600,000 soldiers died, a president was assassinated, and four million slaves were freed. In its aftermath, one region lay in ruins, but most Americans prospered as never before: their country had been saved, its government strengthened, its indivisibility preserved. 
 For those seeking to understand this conflict's remarkable grip on our collective imagination, The Civil War Experience is a good place to start. Bulging with information, beautifully put together and simple to navigate, it combines serious history with mindless (though mildly addictive) razzle-dazzle. Made in conjunction with the History Channel, the disc includes 150 top-flight biographies of leading Civil War figures and dozens of topical essays supplemented by video clips and eyewitness accounts. There are video games that allow you to blast the enemy with cannon fire and run a naval blockade. There is also a trivia game that I strongly urge overconfident historians to avoid.
The opening section of this CD-ROM, The Road to War, is disappointing. Essays on topics like the Missouri Compromise (1820-1821), the Kansas-Nebraska Act (1854) and the Dred Scott decision (1857) provide some historical background, a sound idea, except that the essays, alas, are flat, poorly connected and confuse the slavery issue. In the Dred Scott essay, for example, we are told that "Southerners saw the decision as a guarantee that slavery would be protected within Southern borders." In fact, that point had long been conceded by most Northerners, Lincoln among them. What Southerners really saw in the Dred Scott decision was a guarantee that slavery would be protected into the vast federal territory acquired in the Louisiana Purchase and the Mexican War.
Most viewers, I suspect, will peruse The Civil War Experience for important people and events, like Gen. Robert E. Lee, the Battle of Gettysburg and the Emancipation Proclamation.
The search functions are excellent. Following simple instructions, I began my journey by typing in "Stonewall." Eighteen sources for Gen. Thomas J. Jackson appeared, each accessible with the click of a mouse. I learned that he got his nickname after standing firm at the First Battle of Bull Run and that his battlefield tactics, marked by supreme self-confidence and personal fury, were responsible for much of the South's early military success. I also discovered that this eccentric general, believing one side of his body to be larger than the other, kept an arm raised skyward to increase the flow of blood to his less developed side and purposely ate food he hated in the hope that denial of pleasure would make him "morally better." When Jackson fell at Chancellorsville in 1863, shot accidentally by his own troops, the hopes of the South may have died with him.
The Civil War Experience contains a military time line detailing every skirmish from 1861 through 1865, with major battles like Shiloh, Antietam, Gettysburg and Vicksburg receiving lavish attention.
Influenced perhaps by Ken Burns's "Civil War" documentary, the disc's makers included grainy photographs of bloated corpses, muffled sounds of cannon fire and cavalry charges, somber renderings of eyewitness accounts and talking heads explaining the finer points of warfare. Major battles are divided into days, sometimes hours, with excellent maps.
Military buffs will find much to admire. Want to know the sort of shells that Union gunners lobbed toward Confederate lines? Click on Artillery. Want to know the colors of the 15th Kentucky Infantry Regiment? Click on Flags of War. Want to know how many Jewish soldiers fought for each side? Click on Ethnic Regiments. (The answer: 5,500 Jews for the North, 3,000 for the South.) Those craving more information will find that Jews were "less prone to bacteria-based diseases" because they ate kosher food.
The best parts of The Civil War Experience document the daily lives of soldiers, civilians and slaves -- their work, clothes, food, games and music. You can follow a young infantryman or naval officer, on either side, from enlistment through discharge or death.
A powerful section portrays the horrors of prison camps like Andersonville in Georgia and Elmira in upstate New York. Some 420,000 soldiers from both sides were penned up like animals and nearly 50,000 died.
A section about medical care details things like the workings of a field hospital where amputations were performed with a saw, some whiskey and large doses of opium and morphine. Those who survived often faced a life of drug addition -- known as Old Soldier's Disease.
The Civil War Experience offers an exceptional, almost smothering, coverage of events. What it lacks -- what it may have consciously avoided -- is an overview of the conflict that weaves together important events into a coherent whole. How, exactly, did the Union victory at Antietam alter President Lincoln's plans for the abolition of slavery? What impact did the Civil War's revolutionary technological advances have upon America's future industrial growth? Why, in the end, do we consider this glorious bloodletting to be the most important event in our nation's history? For answers to questions like these, a trip to the public library is still very much in order.

HEADLINE: The Conran Has Landed

BYLINE: By JULIE V. IOVINE 

 BODY:
ON the eve of the grand opening of the Terence Conran Shop, which sticks out from beneath the mighty arches of the Queensboro Bridge on the Upper East Side, Sir Terence Conran was clutching a wad of trash. All around him, various kits and caboodles of stylishly pared-down home furnishings were being unpacked in a frenzy and stacked onto shelves, tables and burnished steel display cases. Blue rubber radios, Italian plastic stacking chairs, leather clothes hampers, gigantic white ceramic platters and transparent shower curtains with pockets: the paraphernalia of a knowingly hip modern existence (for the Wallpaper years) stretched out over 26,000 white-on-white square feet. Dressed in a dark suit with a black tie etched in hieroglyphic Eames, Corbu and Rietveld chairs, Sir Terence seemed pleased with his comeback (his last American venture ended in 1988).
"When I started as a young designer," said Sir Terence, who was knighted in 1983, "I poured over Arts & Architecture magazine for inspiration. And I thought, 'Now, that's what modern life in America is like!' Of course, it wasn't at all. The only way to see modern furniture was in showrooms closed to the public." He winced briefly at the sound of glass breaking on the floor, then proceeded on a tour of the store, pausing to point out the bridal registry ("the divorce registry," he called it) and the shelves devoted to pet products ("against my will," he noted). 
 The Conran Shop is housed in a suitably zoomy structure, designed with Hugh Hardy: shoppers enter through a Miesian glass pavilion with a swooping airport hangar roof to find a boutique-size space filled with glass vitrines displaying higher-priced wares (ultrasleek steel watches; fountain pens embossed with a Charles and Ray Eames pattern) and a selection of the most Euro of the furniture. ("That's my Moss space," Sir Terence said, referring to the oh-so-smart SoHo shop.) A grand stair descends to the real merchandise bazaar that sprawls underground. As in those color-coded parking lots, the robin's egg blue of the elevator block helps shopaholics find their bearings, periodically, amid the leather sofas, Noguchi paper lamps and aromatherapy sprays.
"When I was here in 1977," he said, "it was all to do with repro furniture. The people buying modern were a bit odd. Now the reverse is true." He picked up a demitasse cup with a solid molded handle a bit like an ear and mumbled something about wishing he had come up with that one himself.
Through retro, PoMo and flea-market whimsy, Terence Conran has stayed the course, and his belief in the moderately priced modern has paid off handsomely. The new Manhattan store, which opened yesterday, is the 10th Conran Shop worldwide. There are already three in London, two in Paris, two in Japan and two in Germany. He had planned to return to the United States before now, he said, but it took five years to secure the site.
"This is the ultimate amazing space we could find anywhere in the world," said Sir Terence, whose plans also include a vast restaurant, scheduled to open in February. "I was happy to wait to make it happen."
It's not a moment too soon. More than a dozen stores selling the modern look have opened or reintroduced themselves since fall, from the acutely curated and newly expanded Moss, on Greene Street, to Homer, on Madison Avenue, specializing in modern furnishings from France.
The Conran Shop will easily bowl New Yorkers over with the quantity of its merchandise. The selection includes some 8,500 products, many imported from Europe and quite a few bearing designer names like Philippe Starck, Ron Arad, Tom Dixon and Achille Castiglioni. A 40,000-square-foot warehouse on the other side of the bridge will prevent long shipping delays. At least 1,000 objects were designed by Sir Terence and his team, including a gracefully curved-back rattan armchair, the distant cousin to a recycled raffia chair by Antonio Citterio for B&B Italia. "I made that in the Philippines for Lloyd Loom," he said. It costs $750, without the cushion.
At 68, Sir Terence radiates an optimism in design the likes of which hasn't really been seen since Charles and Ray Eames made their joyously kinetic movie about toys. "Shouldn't we be proud living in the year 2000? he asked rhetorically. "Shouldn't we use the technology that the year 2000 represents and be modern people?"
"It's the economy, of course," he added. "I've been through four recessions, and in bad times, people turn to beige." Sir Terence laughed a tad nervously as he passed two beige armchairs and a darker beige sofa, before striding on to admire some gray flannel sheets.

HEADLINE: General Motors Is Using Buicks to Make Inroads in China

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Dec. 8

 BODY:
When the chairman of General Motors, John F. Smith Jr., drove the first Buick off an assembly line here a year ago -- after fumbling to find the emergency brake -- it looked like an omen of another American company's hapless foray into China.
On Tuesday, a team of Chinese workers fussed over a white Buick minivan -- tightening the bolts, pounding out the kinks and otherwise putting the finishing touches on a vehicle that represents G.M.'s next big bet on the world's most populous nation. This time, it rolled off the line without a hitch. 
 G.M. is off to an unexpectedly smooth start in its ambitious campaign to conquer China's car market. The company will sell about 20,000 Buicks this year, double its own projections and those of outside analysts. Emboldened by its success, G.M. plans to roll out the new minivan next week, extending its product line from a very expensive sedan to an equally costly family workhorse.
"We were totally surprised to see how many cars they sold," said Michael J. Dunne, the president of Automotive Resources Asia, a market research firm with offices in Beijing and Bangkok. "For the time being, they've got a lock on a very good market."
A few caveats are in order. A large majority of G.M.'s sales are to government officials and executives at state-run enterprises. The government has cracked down on the smuggling of imported cars, which has eliminated much of the Buick's potential competition. And Volkswagen's Audi unit, which also produces in China, is about to introduce a model that could be a formidable rival to Buick.
Still, given the dire predictions of many skeptics in the industry last December, G.M. executives here are allowing themselves a low-key victory lap.
"The car is a lot better than people thought it would be," said Philip Murtaugh, the executive vice president of Shanghai G.M., which is a joint venture with China's largest sedan maker, the Shanghai Automotive Industry Group.
"Before G.M. came here, the cars produced in China were horrible," he said. "The quality was poor, the service was nonexistent, and the technology was 10 to 15 years out of date."
G.M.'s early success is a beacon in the dismal landscape of foreign joint ventures in China. The company's $750 million investment in Shanghai G.M. is the largest single American investment in the country. Its spit-and-polish assembly plant in an industrial zone here has become a sort of shrine for Chinese and foreign business people, who come to gawk at the cars and the camaraderie.
"We're still in very early days," said Stephen M. Harner, a former banker at Deutsche Bank here who helped arrange financing for the venture. "But if they can pay back their financing on time or even ahead of schedule, it would strongly enhance the image of the China market."
Given G.M.'s surprising sales figures, Mr. Murtaugh said he was not fazed by the next potentially big obstacle facing the automaker: the landmark trade agreement between China and the United States. The deal, which will lower tariffs on imported cars to 25 percent from their current level of 80 to 100 percent by 2006, could theoretically swamp China's market with luxury cars that cost much less than the $40,000 Buick.
By then though, Mr. Murtaugh said, G.M. will have cut its own costs enough to bring down the price of the sedan and the minivan, which also will be priced at about $40,000.
The Chinese trade deal with the United States also offers some potentially enticing inducements to G.M. and other American automakers. For example, it would allow them to make cars more affordable by establishing auto loan services in China, where buying on credit remains a relative novelty. Customers pay cash up front.
The idea of selling a $40,000 car in a country with an annual gross domestic product of less than $800 a person remains baffling. China's best-selling foreign car is a utilitarian VW sedan that sells for less than $14,000. Never mind that outside of Shanghai, Beijing and a few other cities, China's roads are ill-suited to the soft ride and generous curves of a Buick sedan.
The secret of G.M.'s success is that the Buick was never intended to be a mass-market vehicle in the broadest sense of the term. General Motors is catering to government officials and managers at state-owned companies, who get a chauffeur-driven car as a perk. The Chinese government has encouraged these officials to buy Buicks, and has made the choice easier by rooting out smuggled imports. With 100 percent tariffs, legitimate imports like Mercedes-Benz or G.M.'s Cadillac are beyond the reach of all but the most high-level officials.
"Think of the China market as a fortress with walls built all around it, and G.M. is the only American manufacturer inside the walls," Mr. Dunne said.
The question is: What will General Motors do after it sells every bureaucrat a Buick?
Jay Hunt, the marketing and sales director of Shanghai G.M., said the company was selling more cars to private buyers than it had expected. In particular, the Buick is proving popular in the freewheeling province of Guangdong, which has long been home to the smuggled Mercedes with the missing hood ornament. Still, individual buyers account for only 10 percent of the Buick's total sales.
The minivan is G.M.'s first attempt to broaden the market. Mr. Hunt said the primary buyers would continue to be government ministries and companies. But General Motors will also woo affluent younger executives, who could use the van on weekends to ferry their families.
G.M. will market the vehicle under the name Buick GL8. Inside the company, employees refer to it as the W-wagon, a bit of legerdemain that is meant to satisfy Chinese officials, who granted a license to produce minivans to a Mercedes joint venture that is defunct.
General Motors may have to resort to such creative nomenclature again. Beijing is stingy about allowing foreign manufacturers to add new models to their product lines. But employees at Shanghai G.M. say the long-term goal is to produce a smaller, cheaper car that will compete head-to-head with Volkswagen, which sold 235,000 cars in China in 1998 and is the leading foreign automaker here.
G.M.'s problems could proliferate as the Chinese market becomes more crowded. Mr. Dunne noted that next year, VW, Honda Motor and Audi will all come out with new, locally produced models that could erode G.M.'s franchise. As the market matures, he predicted, the government will grant licenses for further new models, some of which are bound to threaten Buick.
China's bid to join the World Trade Organization is perhaps the biggest imponderable. Some analysts contend that even if tariffs were slashed to 25 percent, Beijing would limit imports through taxes and other nontariff barriers. Yet Mr. Murtaugh acknowledged that a more open China would be a tougher place for General Motors to compete in. "Over the long term, W.T.O. will probably make our lives more difficult," he said.

HEADLINE: Clinton Defends His Role At the Seattle Trade Talks

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 8

 BODY:
President Clinton today defended his handling of last week's failed trade negotiations, and said his insistence that labor and environmental issues be central to the talks was not intended to provide political cover for Vice President Al Gore's presidential campaign.
For days there has been sniping within his administration about how the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle had gone so wrong, and criticism from developing nations and free-trade advocates at home that he had sacrificed an opportunity for a round of trade liberalization to narrow domestic political interests. But Mr. Clinton said it was unrealistic to believe that international economic agreements could avoid dealing with issues like worker rights and pollution. 
 In his first extensive remarks on the subject after rioting in Seattle's streets and a deadlock around the negotiating table, Mr. Clinton said at a news conference that he remained a strong supporter of expanding free trade and optimistic that another round of trade liberalization would eventually get under way.
"I think the position of Americans, including some in my own party, that trade is bad for America and bad for the world is just dead wrong," Mr. Clinton said. "I think that the world is more prosperous, and I know America is more prosperous, because of the continuing integration of the world's economy."
Mr. Clinton had told the trade officials meeting in Seattle that they should "open up" to the concerns of the demonstrators in the streets. And Mr. Clinton had caused an uproar among poor nations by saying that he would at some point support using sanctions against developing countries that failed to live up to internationally agreed upon labor standards.
Today, Mr. Clinton sought to explain his statement on sanctions.
"As the world grows more interdependent, it is unrealistic to think that there will be an international economic policy with rules unrelated to an emerging international consensus on the environment, an international consensus on labor," Mr. Clinton said.
"That does not mean I would cut off our markets to India and Pakistan, for example, if they didn't raise their wages to American levels," he said. "I know that's what the sort of stated fear was. I never said that. I don't believe that."
The president said that he had sought to address labor and environmental concerns in trade agreements since the 1992 presidential campaign, when he supported ratification of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada on the condition that those issues be included.
As a result, he said, it is "wrong" to suggest that he sabotaged last week's trade talks by pressing an agenda backed by two constituencies vital to Mr. Gore in his pursuit of the Democratic presidential nomination and the general election: organized labor and environmental groups.
"I think I've got a good position here," Mr. Clinton said. "It has nothing to do with this campaign. It's a position I've had for years, and I believe the world will slowly come to it."
Still, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore face a tricky balancing act in the coming months as they move on to the administration's next big trade initiative: winning approval in Congress for China's entry into the World Trade Organization.
Organized labor has made clear that it intends an all-out effort against China's entry on the grounds that China exploits it workers and threatens the viability of jobs in many American industries.
But with the encouragement of the White House, business groups are planning a lobbying counteroffensive to convince both Democrats and Republicans that blocking a trade deal with Beijing will reduce the ability of the United States to profit from China's rapid growth and forgo an opportunity to promote democratic capitalism and human rights through economic engagement.
Mr. Clinton acknowledged that the battle over China would be difficult, and would be especially divisive among Democrats.
"We have a good deal of support for it and a good deal of opposition to it, and then some questions," Mr. Clinton said. "But I'm going to make an all-out effort to pass it."
Mr. Clinton said he would make his case on both economic and strategic grounds, saying that the United States would be the big winner from increased trade with China and that closer economic ties would allow the United States to have a more constructive relationship with the world's most populous nation.
But he said he would not single out China in pressing for improvements in the rights and working conditions of its labor force.
"I think having China in a rule-based system for the international economy is profoundly important, and I think it would be a terrible mistake not to do it," Mr. Clinton said. "Now, do I agree with all their labor standards? No. But we shouldn't impose conditions of membership on China that we don't impose on any other country to get into the W.T.O."

HEADLINE: Tests That Cheat Students

BYLINE: By Alfie Kohn; Alfie Kohn is the author of "The Schools Our Children Deserve."

DATELINE: BELMONT, Mass.

 BODY:
The allegations that some New York City teachers may have cheated to raise their students' test scores should surprise no one -- partly because of similar accusations elsewhere but also because of the enormous pressure on educators to produce better results.
We would do well to look at how heavy-handed demands for "tougher standards" and "accountability" not only invite cheating but also cheat children out of opportunities for meaningful learning. 
 Almost every state has issued standards mandating what all students at a given grade level must know. Apart from embodying the dubious premise that all children must develop at the same pace, these standards are often marked by an extraordinary specificity. A typical state document might say, for example, that children at a particular level must be able to use the Reader's Guide and know about zygote formation -- an instructional approach that promotes rote recall ahead of understanding.
The standards can be ludicrously unrealistic. One in Virginia, for example, says fourth graders are required to "evaluate the social, political, and economic life in Virginia from the Reconstruction period to the 20th century . . . and its impact on politics and government, the economy, demographics, and public opinion; the impact of segregation . . . and the economic and social transition from a rural, agricultural society to a more urban, industrialized society." And that's only one standard in only one field -- for 9-year-olds.
Other states use the same sort of lofty language but then give students tests that fall far short of what it promises. A Massachusetts standard stipulates that 10th graders "will understand the meaning, implications, and import of historical events while recognizing the contingency and unpredictability of history." But here is a question students must answer to show they are meeting this standard: "Which individual led independence movements in 19th century South America: (a) Simon Bolivar, (b) Fidel Castro, (c) Francisco Pizarro, or (d) Gustavus Adolphus?"
Many states are giving so-called high-stakes tests: A student who has not crammed names, dates and facts into short-term memory is denied a high-school diploma regardless of academic record, or an elementary student must repeat a grade based on a single test score.
Researchers in Colorado asked some fourth-grade teachers to teach a specific task. About half the teachers were told that when they were finished, their students would have to "perform up to standards" on a test. The other teachers were simply invited to "facilitate the children's learning." At the end, when all the students were tested, it turned out that students in the "standards" classrooms did a poorer job on the task.
Every hour spent on such exam preparation is an hour not spent helping students to become critical, creative, curious learners.
A few years ago, a middle-school teacher in Cambridge, Mass., devised a remarkable unit. Every student picked an activity that he or she cared about and became an expert in it. Each subject, from baking to ballet, was researched intensively, described in a detailed report and taught to other children. The idea was to hone researching and writing skills while also heightening children's appreciation for the craftsmanship involved in many different activities. It was the kind of experience that people look back on years later as a highlight of school. But thanks to the new state standardized exam, that unit has been struck from the curriculum. The teacher is too busy helping students master prescribed material.
Some officials are sincere in their desire to use standards and testing as a way to close gaps between white and black, rich and poor. The reality is that many second-rate schools in the inner city are becoming third-rate as students are drilled day after day to pass the tests.
The most promising models of teaching have trouble surviving in such a climate. Central Park East Secondary School in New York holds students to genuinely high standards by asking them to prepare projects exhibiting their learning. Deborah Meier, the school's co-founder, attracted worldwide attention for its extraordinary success with a largely poor, African-American population. Recently she commented that judging all students in New York on the basis of the Regents exam "will spell the slow demise" of schools like hers.
Small wonder that some parents and students around the country are simply refusing to be part of the testing programs. In the last year alone, boycotts have sprung up in several states. These acts of civil disobedience -- along with less admirable responses like cheating -- will probably grow until the message is heard: Raising scores is completely different from helping students to learn.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Shares End Lower on Profit Taking as Dow Drops 38.53

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Stocks closed mostly lower yesterday as investors took a break from recent buying sprees in the technology sector and failed to find reasons to buy stocks in the broader market.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 38.53 points, to 11,068.12. Broader stock indicators gave up early gains and closed with modest losses. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 5.29 points, to 1,403.88, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 0.84 point, to 3,586.08. 
 Brian G. Belski, chief investment strategist at George K. Baum & Company, described the choppy movements in the Dow and the S.& P. 500 as "backing and filling." Those gauges are pausing after a steep run-up, he said, trying to muster strength for the next push higher.
The Nasdaq, pausing after its recent surge, ended a string of four consecutive closing highs. On Tuesday, the index rose 40.91 points, to 3,586.92, setting its 20th closing high since Oct. 29, largely because of a 23 percent gain by shares of Yahoo, the Internet search company.
Yahoo was added to the S.& P. 500 after the close of trading Tuesday, a move that pushed its stock price higher as index fund managers bought shares. Yesterday, though, Yahoo fell as investors collected profits from its steep ascent.
Investors continued to seek other technology shares that have performed well this year. Shares of Hewlett-Packard and Amazon.com rose. But market leaders like Dell Computer and Intel slipped.
"The market has been correcting in a very quiet way," said Barry Hyman, senior equity analyst at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. While the largest technology stocks have bounded higher in recent weeks, most stocks have languished.
That trend is partly a result of the calendar: As portfolio managers polish their holdings for end-of-year reports, they buy the best-performing stocks and shed any laggards, Mr. Hyman said.
Bill Miller, president of Legg Mason Fund Advisor, said that as the year ends, investors seem to be applying stricter standards to the Internet companies that have dominated the market for much of 1999.
"There's a high degree of expectation, but many of these companies don't have business models that are sustainable," he said. Mr. Miller singled out Amazon.com and America Online as companies that have fortified their business plans and attracted enough customers to prove their merit on Wall Street.

Treasury Prices Slip
 By Bloomberg News
Treasury bond prices fell yesterday, snapping a three-day advance that drove yields to a two-week low, on concern that economic growth might prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again in the months ahead.
Corporate and government agency debt sales, including a $1 billion offering by Procter & Gamble, drew investors away from Treasuries, as did declines in European bonds, traders said.
The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 12/32, to 98 21/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.22 percent, from 6.20 percent on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Racing To Convert Books to Bytes;
Evolving Market for E-Titles

BYLINE: By DOREEN CARVAJAL 

 BODY:
Rarely does anything between covers astonish a librarian like Dennis Dillon, but he says he is shocked when he examines the latest reports about reading patterns of students at the University of Texas at Austin.
Circulation is down. Turnstiles are moving at a slower pace at the most populous campus in the United States. But with a bare minimum of promotion, the university's newly purchased electronic books, like "From Barbie to Mortal Kombat" or "Euthanasia: A Reference Handbook," are suddenly circulating like freshly published Grisham novels. 
 "No one was sure whether anyone was going to read any digital books," said Mr. Dillon, the university's head of collections and information resources. "We were somewhat skeptical. Usually a book has a one-third chance of being checked out. So to have some title checked out 25 times in two months -- that's shocking."
With a $1 million budget for digital materials, the University of Texas is preparing to increase its 6,000-title collection of digital books. It is investing in the evolving electronic frontier of the book market, which is preparing for rapid change despite widespread skepticism that the vast majority of readers are truly ready to cuddle up to a good byte.
New players like netLibrary -- which sells collections of digital books to libraries -- are engaged in a frantic international race to convert paper books to bytes with the ultimate goal of dominating the evolving market.
And traditional publishers are cautiously preparing for an uncharted future, digitizing thousands of old backlist titles in preparation for an e-new world where books can live forever because they will never go out of print.
Yet some publishing experts doubt that changes will come rapidly, given the demographics of the American book market. The most reliable and free-spending group of book purchasers was raised on paper and they are edging into their mid-40's and up.
Nevertheless, a number of major publishers here and in Europe are preparing for the possibility of a surge in demand for electronic books that many believe could be driven by the same type of readers that powered the paperback revolution: the young.
As the market develops, the definition of a book is evolving into an exotic collection of literary hybrids -- electronic titles that can be read as e-mail, retrieved by a portable electronic reading device, downloaded to a computer or converted quickly from digital versions into bound copies that can be printed in less than 30 seconds.
And in the very near future, readers will be able to mince these digital versions into customized titles available by the chapter or page. For example, in the next six months, readers of IDG's Arthur Frommer's travel guides will be able to create am electronic book so narrow in scope that it explores restaurants in the Loire Valley in France with reservation links to recommended hotels or airlines.
With the immediacy of electronic books, digital titles can be published at greater speed and at greater peril for unchecked information. The forms of writing in electronic versions are shifting, allowing authors to create never-ending electronic books with constant revisions or expanded titles that include the literary flotsam of notes, diary entries, memos, images and maps.
Not everyone agrees as to when this new future will take hold. Technology giants are boldly promising swift change, with Microsoft predicting that many e-titles will outsell their paper cousins within a decade.
Random House, the nation's largest publisher, is not making the same boasts, but the company, part of Bertelsmann, has embarked on a two-year project to digitize all of the books on its entire backlist of 20,000 titles, with 5,000 already converted. Simon & Schuster, part of Viacom, is formatting all of its new books in digital form and is preparing to digitize at least 4,000 of its 20,000 backlist titles next year.
But because of security and piracy concerns, Simon & Schuster is still reluctant to allow Microsoft access to its titles for use with new digital display software that will be available next year for reading, searching and annotating books on a computer.
"We're trying to create a strategy for the future that is not totally clear because it's evolving and changing and converging at the same time," said Jack Romanos, the head of Simon & Schuster's consumer trade division, where electronic book sales at this point have totaled less than one-tenth of one percent of isales. Still, he added, "We believe there is an electronic future."
In Europe, the French publisher Havas and the Italian publisher Mondadori announced agreements in October to publish electronic books that can be read on the coming Microsoft Reader software and downloaded from Web sites. Major European publishers of science, technical and medical books have joined with American publishers like John Wiley & Sons to electronically link citations listed in their journals -- a network that ultimately could lead to links between electronic textbooks.
And last month, the nation's leading bookseller, Barnes & Noble, purchased a 49 percent stake in iUniverse.com, a new electronic vanity publisher in Campbell, Calif., that charges a modest fee to would-be authors to post manuscripts in electronic versions.
Such newcomers to the book industry are spread far from the traditional capital of publishing in New York.
To a certain extent, these companies are caught up in a classic chicken-and-egg quandary. To attract readers, they must offer a wide variety of titles. But to persuade publishers to sell titles, they have to demonstrate that there is a market and that the technology is secure from piracy. As a result, many of the companies are expanding their collections with public domain titles.
NetLibrary, for instance, has outposts in China, India and the Philippines where workers are converting books to electronic copies by typing the text into computers. Scanning the material directly into a computer posed too much potential for errors, according to the company. And so now the digital versions are copied in other parts of the world and then edited and refined by "book builders" at netLibrary's rapidly expanding headquarters in Boulder, Colo., where two shifts of employees work, from 7 a.m. to midnight. The company is converting about 50 books a day, but by December, the rate will rise to 200, said David Melancon, the company's marketing director.
A start-up, with $105 million in new financing, netLibrary is aggressively pursuing major libraries to buy electronic collections so that library users will have 24-hour access to titles, with full-text searches. Since August, it has sold more than $1.5 million in electronic books to libraries like the one at the University of Texas, which bought 1,000 copies and acquired 5,000 more titles through consortium purchases. At this point, netLibrary's digital collection is dominated by reference and scholarly titles from academic presses, but the company intends to offer popular trade book titles that could also be offered to individual users by subscription.
"Everybody realizes how quickly the business is going to change," Mr. Melancon said. "And once it starts, having first-mover advantage is huge. The key to grabbing the market is having the most content."
Other Internet start-ups are expanding their offerings by making publishing as democratic as possible.
Fatbrain.com is an online bookseller of computer and technical books that started a few years ago in a Silicon Valley garage. Last month it announced an infusion of $20 million in venture capital to support a publishing program that allows authors to sell their works online for a 50 percent royalty.
The result has been the appearance of such works as Richard Bach's "Air Ferrets Aloft." A Fatbrain.com summary describes the title as "the first widely published disclosure of the remarkable activities of the world's domesticated ferret community, told through the stories of outstanding individual animals."
Soon to come: "Philosopher Ferrets in the Wilderness."
Already there is some restiveness about whether this new technology will produce wider selection or simply digital slush.
Netlibrary, for instance, will not accept any self-published titles on its site. The company's view is that books have more credibility when they are screened and filtered by professional editors.
"We're not allowing people to post their titles," Mr. Melancon said. "If you do, it devalues the other books because it doesn't have credibility. Say I go to a Web site and I look up books on low birth weight and prenatal care in developing countries. I pull up a book by Sam Jones and I have no idea who Sam Jones is."
The price of netLibrary's books are the same as print versions, but other companies are already starting to experiment with e-book price discounts because of reduced costs for storage, inventory and paper.
Zero Heure, a French publisher founded two years ago, is able to offer discounts for electronic titles that the Bertelsmann-owned online bookseller, Bol.Fr, cannot match for printed versions because of European rules regulating cover prices for conventional books.
A minute after an order is placed, the electronic publisher will e-mail some of the latest French best sellers at one third off the list price to American customers with no access to print versions in stores here.
Zero Heure is buying the electronic rights for print books, but is also publishing its own original titles. Next month, for instance, the company intends to publish "Ici Kaboul," a continuing book about an Afghan woman's experiences in Kabul that will be updated quarterly with new electronic chapters. "She's writing a chronicle of her life and this could continue as long as she wants," said Jean-Pierre Arbon, one of the company's founders and the former managing director of the French publisher Flammarion.
This experimentation with literary forms has spread to new companies with no publishing experience like CyberGold, an e-commerce company that offers an array of digital products.
This month, CyberGold featured its first electronic title, "Dark Again," a thriller by David Saperstein, the author of the book, "Cocoon," which inspired the movie. It is available for $7.50 for the entire book or 50 cents a chapter. Each chapter includes additional material -- from the assassin's corporate memos to diary entries.
One very basic question that all these companies must confront is whether readers will warm to the new forms.
Some companies, like netFind, are counting on a generation of young readers, weaned on computers, that is ready to read on screens. But as skeptics have pointed out, for years to come companies will also have to reach the much larger group of older readers to make the market viable.
"I'm 48, and for me I can't do it," confessed Mr. Dillon, who is still in charge of amassing electronic titles for the University of Texas. "But my kids are in high school and they read books from beginning to end on the Web."
Despite his own personal misgivings, he is still betting on a generational shift that will raise the popularity of e-books. He noted, for example, that the library had expected that readers would only be interested in electronic versions exploring computer topics. But the taste in digital fare is far more eclectic, with readers checking out titles from "Art, Ideology and Economics in Nazi Germany" to "100 Years of Tomorrow: Brazilian Women's Fiction."
"We're willing to put the money there because we're guessing that's what will happen," he said of student demand. 'It's getting harder and harder to get them to go into their car to come to the library."

Chart:Chart: "Paperless Publishing"
Traditional publishers are gearing up to be ready for whatever form of digital publishing emerges.
 
DIGITALLY PORTABLE
An electronic book that can be downloaded and read in a portable device. Publishers expect such devices to come in a range of sizes and weights with search functions and the memory capacity to carry dozens of titles.
 
INTERNET READY
Books that can be read online, as well as books that can be customized to suit a reader's interests. Microsoft has just created new software that allows for clearer text display on a computer monitor and allows for full-text search and annotation.
 
DIGITALLY DELIVERED
Books that are ordered online and e-mailed as an attachment. Users can then choose to read on their monitors or to print out portions or all of the book.
 
PRINTER READY
New I.B.M. printing equipment has made it financially viable for publishers to print out a single book, meaning that a book in electronic form need never be out of print.(pg. C1)

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS;
Fed Says Expansion Continues at Moderate to Strong Pace

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 8

 BODY:
The economy continued to expand at a "moderate to strong" pace in October and November with little sign of inflation, the Federal Reserve said today in its latest regional economic survey, suggesting that policy makers may feel less compelled to raise interest rates again soon.
The survey, known as the beige book, cited a rise in retail sales and a broad increase in manufacturing as evidence that the economy was not slowing. Prices were mostly steady as the expansion headed toward a record for longevity early next year. 
 "Consumer spending picked up over the Thanksgiving weekend after being hampered by warm weather in November," the Fed reported. "Manufacturing activity continued to advance in most districts." While home sales slowed, "commercial real estate markets remained strong in most parts of the country," the Fed said.
Companies reported paying more to attract and retain workers. "Wage increases were described as persistent in most districts," the Fed said. Wage and salary increases did not appear to be accelerating generally, though some industries and regions had salary increases of 3 percent to 10 percent, the report said. The use of signing bonuses has spread, the Fed said.
But higher wages -- necessary as the pool of available qualified labor shrinks -- have not translated into accelerating inflation. "Prices at the retail level have been nearly steady in most districts," the Fed said. The same is generally true for industrial goods, though prices of some "have been on the rise," according to the report.
Manufacturing rose in November in most districts. Boston reported strong demand for pharmaceuticals and instruments, Cleveland noted rising output of steel and St. Louis saw increased demand for plastics and auto parts.
Warm weather slowed retail sales in most of the country before Thanksgiving. Sales picked up significantly over the next weekend "and retailers expressed confidence that the brisker pace of sales will continue throughout the holiday shopping period," the Fed said.
The report will help form the basis for discussion at the Dec. 21 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest-rate policy. The Fed panel has raised the target interest rate on overnight loans between banks three times this year to slow the economy and keep inflation in check, most recently on Nov. 16.
In November, the central bankers also adopted a neutral stance toward future interest rate changes, suggesting they were just as likely to cut rates as raise them.
Inflation has remained tame, with the Consumer Price Index up two-tenths of 1 percent in October and 2.6 percent in the last 12 months. The core rate, which excludes food and a doubling of oil prices since February, was up 2.1 percent in 12 months.
The beige book did not mention what may be the key factor in the Fed's interest rate deliberations: productivity gains that should allow the economy to keep growing with low inflation. Productivity has risen at an average annual rate of more than 2.7 percent since mid-1998, faster than the 1 percent average of the previous two decades.
Productivity rose at a 4.9 percent annual rate in the third quarter, the Labor Department said on Tuesday. The third-quarter productivity increase was the biggest since 7.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 1992.
The Fed's regional outlook is based on reports from the Fed's 12 district banks and is published eight times each year before meetings of the open market committee. The latest edition of the beige book was compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. Information was gathered before Nov. 30.

HEADLINE: Gore Concedes Sour Economy Might Require Tax Rise

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

 BODY:
After days of lacerating former Senator Bill Bradley for acknowledging that he might have to raise taxes, Vice President Al Gore today admitted that if the economy took a turn for the worse, he would not rule out a tax increase either.
"Under current economic circumstances, I have no intention of proposing any tax increase," the vice president said. 
 But when pressed by a reporter as to whether he was flatly ruling out ever raising taxes, he said, "I am ruling them out under circumstances that approximate what we have today," and added, "Nobody has a crystal ball."
In an interview here tonight, he elaborated, saying he would not raise taxes "under current circumstances, or anything remotely similar to current circumstances, so long as we have a surplus, so long as we have a balanced budget, so long as we don't have a deep economic crisis of some kind that changes the circumstance."
The vice president took a reporter's pen and notebook and drew a grid to explain his position on taxes as well as Mr. Bradley's.
Under "current circumstances," he wrote: "AG: No New Taxes!" For Mr. Bradley, he wrote: "BB: "May Raise Taxes . . . to pay for health care plan."
But under "unknown future of Economy," he wrote: "AG: Possibilities Hard to Rule Out." For Mr. Bradley, he wrote "BB: same."
To the Bradley campaign's ears, Mr. Gore was finally acknowledging that the two candidates' positions were the same.
Eric Hauser, a spokesman for Mr. Bradley, responded almost triumphantly to Mr. Gore's remarks today, saying, "It's clear that the vice president is in the same place as we are, and it makes me wonder why he spent the better part of a week attacking a position he holds."
Republicans were gleeful at the sight of Democrats fighting over taxes. At a news conference this morning in Washington, Jim Nicholson, chairman of the Republican National Committee, called Mr. Gore and Mr. Bradley "the Frick and Frack of higher tax," adding, "The only difference between Bradley and Gore is that Bradley admits he'll raise our taxes, while Gore wants us to believe he'll limit himself to raising taxes on smokers."
Responding to a challenge by Mr. Bradley on Monday that Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican presidential contender, take a pledge not to raise new taxes, Mr. Nicholson said Mr. Bush already had, as have all six of the Republican presidential candidates.
The dispute in the Democratic race reflects the widely accepted view in politics that any mention of taxes is poison to a campaign, whether it is realistic or not.
The examples are seared in the nation's consciousness: Walter F. Mondale, the Democratic nominee, said during his 1984 campaign that a tax increase was nearly inevitable, and he lost 49 states to Ronald Reagan. And when President George Bush's famous assertion to voters -- "Read my lips: No new taxes" -- was violated, he too was consigned to history.
Mr. Bradley says Mr. Gore has completely distorted what he said about raising taxes. In a transcript of an interview with The Washington Post, where the issue first came up last week, Mr. Bradley never specifically asserted that he would raise taxes. In fact, he was nearly as vague then as Mr. Gore was today.
Mr. Bradley was asked by The Post if a tax increase might be necessary. According to the transcript, Mr. Bradley roamed all over the question, saying at first, "You tell me what the growth rate is, I'll give you the answer." He added: "You have to deal with it at the time." But he said that his desire to provide near-universal health care coverage was non-negotiable, and depending on what else happened, the options were "cutting spending or increasing taxes."
Mr. Gore in the interview in Manhattan, after helping children light a menorah at the 92nd Street Y, said: "If you're talking about the unknown future of the economy, you can't begin to rule out possibilities. But I have no intention of it. His position is the same."
But Mr. Gore insisted there was a difference in their positions, too. "Under our current economic circumstances, I rule it out," he said. "Under our current economic circumstances, he doesn't rule it out. He has to say that he may have to raise taxes because he cannot explain the huge gap in his health care plan."

HEADLINE: Clinton's Words to Press: On the Mideast, Chechnya and Other Matters

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 8

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Clinton's news conference today in the Dean Acheson Auditorium at the State Department, as recorded by the Federal News Service, a transcription company:
 
Opening Statement
We are at a pivotal moment in the Middle East peace process, one that can shape the face of the region for generations to come. As I have said on numerous occasions, history will not forgive a failure to seize this opportunity to achieve a comprehensive peace. We've made good progress on the Palestinian track, and I am determined to help Prime Minister Barak and Chairman Arafat move forward in accordance with their very ambitious timetable. 
 We have also been working intensely for months for a resumption of negotiations between Israel and Syria. Today, I am pleased to announce that Prime Minister Barak and President Assad have agreed that the Israel-Syrian peace negotiations will be resumed from the point where they left off. The talks will be launched here in Washington next week with Prime Minister Barak and Foreign Minister Shara. After an initial round for one or two days, they will return to the region, and intensive negotiations will resume at a site to be determined soon thereafter. These negotiations will be high level, comprehensive and conducted with the aim of reaching an agreement as soon as possible.
Israelis and Syrians still need to make courageous decisions in order to reach a just and lasting peace, but today's step is a significant breakthrough, for it will allow them to deal with each other face to face, and that is the only way to get there.
I want to thank Prime Minister Barak and President Assad for their willingness to take this important step. And I want to thank Secretary Albright, who has worked very hard on this and, as you know, has been in the region and meeting with the leaders as we have come to this conclusion.
Before us is a task as clear as it is challenging. As I told Prime Minister Barak and President Assad in phone conversations with them earlier today, they now bear a heavy responsibility of bringing peace to the Israeli and Syrian people.
On the Palestinian track, Prime Minister Barak and Chairman Arafat are committed to a rapid timetable, a framework agreement by mid-February, a permanent status agreement by mid-September. I'm convinced it is possible to achieve that goal, to put an end to a generation of conflicts, to realize the aspirations of both the Israeli and the Palestinian people. And I will do everything I can to help them in that historic endeavor. It is my hope that with the resumption of Israeli-Syrian talks, negotiations between Israel and Lebanon also will soon begin.
There can be no illusion here. On all tracks the road ahead will be arduous, the task of negotiating agreements will be difficult. Success is not inevitable. Israelis, Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese will have to confront fateful questions. They face hard choices. They will have to stand firmly against all those who seek to derail the peace. And sadly, there are still too many of them.
But let there also be no misunderstanding. We have a truly historic opportunity now. With a comprehensive peace, Israel will live in a safe, secure and recognized border for the first time in its history. The Palestinian people will be able to forge their own destiny on their own land. Syrians and Lebanese will fulfill their aspirations and enjoy the full fruits of peace. And throughout the region, people will be able to build more peaceful and, clearly, more prosperous lives. As I have said, and I say one more time, I will spare neither time nor effort in pursuit of that goal.
Today, the parties have given us clear indication that they, too, are willing to take that path. Peace has long been within our sight. Today, it is within our grasp and we must seize it. . . .
 
Questions and Answers
 
Q. As a father, do you sympathize with the demand of Elian Gonzalez for the return of his 6-year-old son to Cuba, now that the boy's mother and stepfather were drowned in a boating accident on the way to Florida?
 
A. Well, of course, I think all fathers would be sympathetic. The question is, and I think the most important thing, is what would be best for the child. And there is a legal process for determining that. And I personally don't think that any of us should have any concern other than that, that the law be followed. I don't think that politics or threats should have anything to do with it, and if I have my way, it won't. We should let the people who are responsible for this, who have the legal responsibility, try to do the right thing by the child.
These decisions are often difficult, even in domestic situations. And -- but I hope that is what will be done, and it should be done without regard to politics. . . .
 
Q. On Chechnya, you used sanctions to punish Yugoslavia and Indonesia for repression. Why aren't sanctions being considered against Russia?
 
A. Well, there are two categories of aid here in question, or at least -- let's talk about the aid. A sanctions regime has to be imposed by the United Nations, and Russia has a veto there. But I am not sure that would be in our interests or in the interests of the ultimate resolution of the crisis.
Let me just say with regard to the aid, because I have been asked about that, I think it's important to point out to the American people that two-thirds of the aid that we spend in Russia is involved in denuclearization and safeguarding nuclear materials. And I think it is plain that we have an interest in continuing that. The other third goes to fund democracy, the things that we Americans believe would lead to better decisions. It goes to an independent media. It goes to student exchanges. It goes to NGO's, to helping people set up small businesses. I don't think our interests would be furthered by terminating that.
And as of now, there is no pending I.M.F. transfer, because of the general opinion by the I.M.F. that not all the economic conditions have been met. So that's a bridge we'll have to cross when we get there.
Yes?
 
Q. Mr. President, when Israel and Syria do sit down, they obviously are going to have to confront the issue of the Golan Heights almost immediately. How are they going to resolve that? What will the U.S. role be? Will you see the administration, Secretary Albright, yourself possibly, being a mediator? And finally, why isn't President Assad sitting down with Prime Minister Barak at this point?
 
A. Well, I think they are sitting down, because they want to make peace, and they have now concluded that they can do it on terms that will meet both their interests.
You've asked good questions, but any answer I give would make it unlikely that they would be successfully resolved. I just -- frankly, we all took a blood oath that we wouldn't talk beyond our points today, and I'm going to keep my word.
 
Q. I'm sorry, Sir, maybe you misunderstood. I was asking why President Assad is not personally involved in the talks at this point.
 
A. Oh, he is very personally involved. I think that -- I believe that he felt it was better -- and maybe you should ask the Syrians this. But I, I, let me just say, he is very personally involved in this. I think it is -- he thinks it better, for whatever reason, he's made the decision that Foreign Minister Shara who, thankfully, has recovered from his recent stroke and is perfectly able to come here, to do so. And I am quite comfortable that this is as close to person-to-person talks that they could have without doing it. . . .
 
Q. On another legal matter, your threat of a class action against gun manufacturers, is this an attempt, Sir, through either coercion or ultimately the judicial branch to get accomplished what you couldn't get accomplished through legislation? And with the difficulties that you've had recently getting some of your initiatives passed in Congress as you head into this last year of your presidency, is this the hint of a new tactic to get those initiatives passed when you can't them through Congress?
 
A. Let's talk about the gun suit first, and then I'll respond to the general question.
The litigation, which is being initiated by public housing authorities, has a good grounding in fact. There are 10,000 gun crimes every year in the largest public housing authorities.
Now they spend a billion dollars on security. And I think it's important that the American people know they are not asking for money from the gun manufacturers. They are seeking a remedy to try to help solve the problem. They want, first of all, more care in manufacturers and the dealers with whom they deal. Senator Schumer released a study, you may remember, that said that 1 percent of the gun dealers sell 50 percent of the guns involved in gun crimes. Now if that study is accurate -- and he believes it is -- that is a stunning fact, and there ought to be something done about that. And if there's a way that a court could craft a resolution of that, that would be a good thing, I think.
The second thing they want to do is to stop irresponsible marketing practices. You all remember that one company advertised an assault weapon by saying that it was hard to get fingerprints from. You know, that's -- you don't have to be all broke out with brilliance to figure out what the message is there. And the third thing they want is some safety design changes.
Now let me hasten to say that we have a lot of gun manufacturers in this country who have been, I think, immensely responsible. If you'll remember, the majority of the gun manufacturers signed on to our proposal for child trigger locks. I still would like legislation to cover them all.
But this is -- this should not be viewed -- if you look at the nature of the relief, they're not trying to bankrupt any companies. They're trying to make their living spaces safer, and I think it's a legitimate thing.
Now to your general question. I think if you go back over the whole reach of our tenure here, I've always tried to use the executive authority in areas where I thought it was important. We're doing it on medical privacy. We're doing it on -- yesterday we had the press conference on prevention of medical errors. We're doing it with the paid-family-leave initiative we offered to the states. We did it when we set aside the roadless areas in the forests. And so I think this is an appropriate thing to do.
But I would also remind you, at the end of this legislative session from the Congress we got 100,000 teachers, 50,000 police, 60,000 housing vouchers to help people move from welfare to work. We passed the Kennedy-Jeffords bill to allow people with disabilities to move into the workplace and keep their medical care from the government. We passed the Financial Modernization Act, which will dramatically, I think, improve financial services, grow the economy, and we protected the Community Reinvestment Act. We doubled the funds for afterschool programs. We provided, for the very first time ever, funds to help school districts turn around failing schools or shut them down. So I'm continuing to work with Congress, and I will do so vigorously. But I think the -- this was an appropriate thing to do on the merits.
Yes?
 
Q. Mr. President, some of your critics have suggested that the reason that you pressed the issues of the environment and labor at the W.T.O. meeting in Seattle was to benefit the presidential candidacy of Vice President Gore, knowing that there might be a backlash from the developing nations. How do you respond to that?
A. That's wrong. And I would like to make two comments, one on the W.T.O. ministerial meeting and secondly on that general issue. The Uruguay Round was launched in 1986. The trade ministers started trying to launch it in 1982. It took them four years to get it off the ground. The fundamental reason a new round was not launched here had, in my judgment, very little to do with my philosophy of trade, which I'll talk about in a moment. There were -- the big blocs here were the Europeans and the Japanese on the one, the United States and the developing nations. We all had positions that couldn't be reconciled. The Europeans were not prepared at this time to change their common agricultural policy, which accounts for 85 percent of the export subsidies in the world. The Japanese had their own agricultural and other issues to deal with. The United States was not prepared to change its policy on dumping, because -- and I think the recent Asian financial crisis justifies it, I might add -- even though we did finally move under our dumping laws, and we had to move to try to keep our steel industry, which took down 60 percent of its employment and modernized during the 80's and the early 90's -- we still bought 10 times as much steel during that crisis as the Europeans did.
The recent W.T.O. agreement we made with China protects us from surges and unfair dumping.
We have the largest trade deficit in the world. Now I -- we get a lot of good out of it. We get low inflation. We get goods from all over the world. But there has to be some sense of fairness and balance here. And the developing nations, for their part, felt that they had not yet gotten enough benefits from the last trade round and the entry into the W.T.O. They think that we and everybody else -- the Europeans, the Japanese, everybody -- they think we ought to have more open markets for agricultural products, which doesn't affect America so much, and for textiles, which does affect us. That's the big issue being negotiated still with the Caribbean Basin and the Africa Trade Initiative.
So it's very important that you understand that there were real differences that we thought we could bridge, unrelated to labor and the environment, which we couldn't, and which I think would have been clearer but for the backdrop of the demonstrations in Seattle over these other issues.
Now to your second question. When I ran for president in 1992 and the big issue being debated was Nafta, I said that I wanted to be for Nafta, I would fight hard for it. But I felt strongly there ought to be provisions on labor and the environment in the agreement. And those provision were included. I have always had what I guess you would call a "third way" position on trade. I think the position of Americans, including some in my party, that trade is bad for America and bad for the world is just dead wrong. I think that the world is more prosperous, and I know America is more prosperous, because of the continuing integration of the world's economy and the mutual interdependence of people and people being able to produce what they produce best in a competitive environment, including cost.
And I think we benefit, not just from our exports, but from the imports. That's what I believe. I believe we will have both a more prosperous and a more peaceful world if we have more of the right kind of globalization. . . .
 
Q. I'm afraid this is in the pop quiz category of questions, but I'll try to make it easy for you. Every year this time of year, we pick a Man of the Year. Maybe one day it'll be Person of the Year. I'd like to know what your pick of the Man of the Century would be. And note that I'm not asking you for the millennium.
 
A. Well, for -- with the millennium, it might be someone different. Well, there -- this century produced a lot of great men and women. But as an American, I would have to choose Franklin Roosevelt, because of, in this century our greatest peril was in the Depression and World War II and because he led us not only through those things and laid the building blocks for a better society with things like Social Security and unemployment insurance, which was, interestingly enough, first recommended by his cousin Theodore Roosevelt when he was president, but he also looked to the future, endorsing the United Nations and a lot of the other international institutions which were subsequently created under President Truman.
Finally, I think Roosevelt was an example to Americans of the importance of not giving up and of the dignity inherent in every person. And, you know, when Franklin Roosevelt was first elected, Oliver Wendell Holmes was still on the Supreme Court. He was 92 years old. And he was taken -- President Roosevelt was taken to see Oliver Wendell Holmes, who was still reading Plato in his 90's and all that. And Holmes was a pretty acerbic fellow when he said, after meeting Roosevelt, that he thought he might not have had a first-class mind, but he certainly had a first-class temperament, and he did. He understood that reality is more than the facts before you. It is also how you feel about them. How you react to them. What your attitude is. That was the -- "the only thing we have to fear is fear itself" was much more than just a slogan to him. He had lived it before he asked the American people to live it. So for all those reasons, if I had to pick one person, I would pick him. . . .
 
Q. Vice President Gore has made a point of saying that his candidacy for president now will take precedence over his duties and activities as vice president. I wonder how has his role diminished in your administration? And how much is he missed? And does a diminished role by a vice president in your administration hamper what you're trying to do in any way?
 
A. Well, obviously, he's not around as much. We don't have lunch every week, and I miss that terribly. But he was there all day today. He had the meeting with President Kuchma. He knows that the future of Ukraine is very important to our interests and to what we're trying to accomplish in that part of the world. And he came to our meeting this morning and then, after our meeting was over, he ran a whole series of meetings for several hours after that.
So in his critical functions, he's still performing them. And I would say, first of all, I strongly support what he's doing. I think he has a right to run and I'm glad he's running, and I -- and you know I think he'd be a great president. But he -- even having said that, whenever there's an important decision in an area that he's been very active in, I always call him; we still talk about it. And his role is probably still larger than that of any previous vice president, even though he's out campaigning, but it's just less than it used to be because he's not here all the time.
But I have no criticism of it. I think he's doing what he ought to be doing, and I think it's in the best interests of the country for him to do it.
 
Q. You are ending a tumultuous year that began with impeachment and then closed with tear gas in Seattle. Could you tell us what you are proudest of this year and what events or accomplishments of yours that you're the least proud of?
 
A. Well, I'm very happy -- what I'm proudest of is it turned out to be a very productive year. If you look at -- I'll just mention them again. I did before. But we wound up, after a year in which almost nothing was accomplished in the Congress, we wound up with a recommitment to the 100,000 teachers, to the 50,000 police. We passed the financial modernization bill. We passed the historic 60,000 housing vouchers to new people from welfare to work. We passed the bill to give disabled people the right to take health care into the workplace. We doubled afterschool fundings. We passed this fund that I've been pushing hard for for a long time to help the states turn around or shut down failing schools. So it was -- we had quite a lot of accomplishments.
On the foreign front, we had the China W.T.O. agreement, progress with the Middle East peace, the Northern Ireland peace agreement, Kosovo, which I am very, very proud of. I still believe our country did the right thing there. We've got talks starting on Cyprus now. We got the Caspian pipeline agreements, which I believe 30 years from now you'll all look back on and say that was one of the most important things that happened this year. We had the Caspian -- I mean, excuse me -- we had the Conventional Forces in Europe agreement with Russia, which will result in the removal of those forces from Georgia and Moldova. We had the debt relief for the poorest countries in the world, something I'm immensely proud of and deeply committed to. We made a big dent in our year-end arrears issue. And we have worked with North Korea to end their missile program. So I'm very proud of what happened this year.
What I'm most disappointed in is what still got left on the table. I'm terribly disappointed that we still haven't passed the Patients' Bill of Rights, that we still haven't raised the minimum wage, that we still haven't passed hate crimes legislation, that we still didn't pass that common-sense gun legislation, which was crying out for action after what happened at Columbine. And we had another school incident this week.
I am disappointed that we didn't pass the school-construction bill. I am hoping we'll pass the New Markets Initiative next year. If we don't do something now to bring economic opportunity to the areas of this country which have been left behind, we will never forgive ourselves.
And I am profoundly disappointed that we still haven't done anything to take the life of Social Security out beyond the baby-boom generation and extend the life of Medicare and add a prescription-drug benefit. So my only disappointments are what we didn't get done. But I am gratified by what was accomplished. . . .
 
Q. On Chechnya, it seems as though the Russians don't feel they will pay a heavy price. Perhaps they don't care. I'm wondering if between now and Saturday's deadline you plan to try to directly contact President Yeltsin to once again convey your feelings on this matter?
 
A. Well, I haven't decided what else I can do. I do think, first of all, they may believe that because of their position in the United Nations and because no one wants them to fail and have more problems than they've got, that they can do this. But, you know, most of life's greatest wounds for individuals and for countries are self-inflicted. They're not inflicted by other people.
And I will say again the greatest problems that the Russians will have over Chechnya are, one, is I don't think the strategy will work. I have never said they weren't right to want to do something to the Chechen rebels. But I don't think the strategy will work, and therefore it will be expensive, costly and politically damaging internally to them.
Secondly, it will affect the attitude of the international community over a period of time in ways that are somewhat predictable and in some ways unpredictable. And that is a very heavy price to pay because it works better when everybody's pulling for Russia.
It's a great country, and they have all these resources and talent, educated people, and they need to -- and yet they've got a declining life expectancy, as well as all these economic problems. And I think it's a bad thing for this to be the issue -- the No. 1 issue both inside the country and in our relationships with them. So I do think it's going to be a very costly thing.
Yes?
 
Q. Mr. President, with China building a second short-range missile base, allowing them to take Taiwan with little or no warning, are you concerned about America's ability to defend that island, especially with a Chinese company taking over the Panama Canal's ports at the end of this month?
 
A. Well, let's talk about -- let's talk about the Panama Canal, and then I'll come back to Taiwan. And I -- to be fair, I think I may have misstated this earlier. It's important for the American people to understand that the canal itself will be operated and controlled entirely by the government of Panama, through the Panama Canal Authority. That is the locks, ingress and egress, access, openness to the canal is completely and totally within the control of the Panamanians.
Now the Hong Kong company which got the concession to operate the ports will be responsible for loading and unloading ships. They also do this in three or four ports in Great Britain. It's one of the biggest companies in the world that does this. The managing director is British. Most of the employees will be Panamanian. So I feel comfortable that our commercial and security interests can be protected under this arrangement. That's the first question.
Now the second question is China is modernizing its military in a lot of ways. But our policy on China is crystal clear. We believe there is one China. We think it has to be resolved through cross-strait dialogue. And we oppose and would view with grave concern any kind of violent action. And that hasn't changed.
And, you know, there's been a lot of build-up of tension on both sides that I think it unnecessary and counterproductive. If you look at the amount of Taiwanese investment in China, for example, that goes back to my Irish example, if you look at the Taiwanese investment in China, it's obvious that eventually they're going to get this worked out, because they are too interconnected by ties of family and, increasingly, by ties of the economy. And the politics of neither place should lead either side into doing something rash. And I hope that this will not happen. But our policy is clear, and you know what I've done in the past. And I think that's all I should say about it right now.
Yes.
 
Q. Mr. President, there's some confusion in people's minds about the first lady's plans for the coming year. She's referred to the new house in New York as "my house" and indicated she plans to make that her primary residence. I'm wondering if you can tell us how much time you think the two of you will be apart in the coming year and how you feel about this arrangement.
 
A. Well, first of all, I'm happy for her, for the decision that she made. She was encouraged to run by many people, and she decided she wanted to do it. And is she's going to do it. She's got to spend a long time in New York. So she'll be there a lot. She'll be here when she can. I'll go up there when I can. And we'll be together as much as we can. And, you know, we always make it a habit to talk at least once if not more every day. And, you know, it's not the best arrangement in the world, but it's something that we can live with for a year. And I love the house, you know. We picked it out, and we like it, and I'm looking forward to living there when I leave here.
But I've got a job to do, and she now has a campaign to run, and so we'll have to be apart more than I wish we were. But it's not a big problem. She'll be here quite a lot, and I'll go up there when I can, and we'll manage it, and I think it will come out just fine. I'm very happy for her. . . .
 
Q. Just a couple of minutes ago you said that most of life's greatest wounds are self-inflicted. If I can paraphrase a recent request by Ken Starr, sir, I wonder if now you can tell us how much of the pain you went through last year was self-inflicted, and how much due to excesses by other people, political, and Mr. Starr's excesses himself, sir?
 
A. Well, the mistake I made was self-inflicted, and the misconduct of others was not. . . .
 
Q. The number of Americans who are not covered by health insurance has increased since you took office by about seven million. Do you agree with Vice President Gore that Senator Bradley's plan for covering most of those people is irresponsible and unaffordable, even though we're enjoying the healthiest economy in decades?
 
A. Well, first of all, I'm not going to get in the middle of the Gore-Bradley campaign. You know -- I know you want me to. But I'm not going to do that for you, because I want you to write about Syria and Israel tomorrow.
But let me say, first of all, Hillary and I said, when the health-care plan went down, that the number of people uninsured would go up. And you would all draw the same conclusion. You would have drawn the same conclusion back then, if you had spent as many years and as much time studying it as we had. So what happened is exactly what we predicted would happen.
Ironically, all those people who attacked me and said I was trying to socialize medicine, which was a ridiculous charge, trying to have the government take over health care, which was a ridiculous charge, they got their way in that debate. And the consequence is we now have a higher percentage of Americans whose health care is funded by the government than we did in 1993. But we also have a higher percentage of people without insurance. Now, I am not going to get in the middle of that. But I'll tell you what questions you ought to ask.
First of all, anybody who makes any proposal -- you have to make certain choices. If you want to cover people who don't have coverage and you accept the premise that they all can't afford it, you have to decide, well, are you going to make them buy insurance or are you going to make their employers pay in? If not, are you going to have the government do it or are you going to have a big tax subsidy?
All of those choices have problems with them. You know what the employer-mandate problem was. We couldn't pass it, because a lot of people said it's too burdensome, even though we exempted small businesses and tried to give them subsidies. If you give all taxpayers subsidies, the problem is you have to give subsidies to people who already have insurance, and it may operate as an incentive for people who are employers to drop people even faster.
So there is no perfect plan. Let's start with that. There is no plan without difficulty. If it were easy, somebody would have done it already.
The second question is, How much are you going to -- if you're going to have the taxpayers involved either in a tax-incentive or an expenditure program, how much does it cost and what do you give up? And I think this is the way this thing ought to debate. People ought to actually try to figure out what the consequences of these plans are and evaluate them, and decide.
You talked about the prosperity of the country. That's true. We are prosperous. But do we want -- how much do we want to spend on that, as compared with eliminating child poverty or continuing to improve education? Are we willing to get into the Social Security surplus? If we're not, are we willing to raise taxes for it?
In other words, I think whatever the choice is, I think it's important that we be as honest as possible about what it costs. Everybody be as honest as possible, because there is no perfect plan. And then you be as honest as possible about what else you're giving up if you do it. It's a very complicated issue. I did my best on it. I'm gratified that we finally passed the Child Health Insurance Program, and we might get those numbers down again. We've now -- I think we're at about two million. I think we've gone from one million to two million just in the last several months, and then there are people covered under CHIP, and if we can get up to five, with CHIP and extra Medicaid kids -- and the states are really gearing up now, they're really trying now -- then maybe we can drive that number back down some.
And you know, what the vice president is trying to do is to target discrete populations on the theory that you can cover more people for relatively less money. And that's his. And he believes he can pass that.
And so I think I -- let me just say one other thing. I'm -- it makes me proud to be a Democrat. I am proud that -- No. 1, that my party is debating this. And as near as I can see, there's no debate going on in the other party, and if they pass the size tax-cut plan they're talking about, they not only won't have any money to help more people get health care, they'll either have to get into the Social Security surplus or they won't have any more money for education or the environment or anything else. That's the first thing I want to say.
The second thing I want to say is, I'm, I'm grateful that my country is doing so well that these kinds of issues can be debated. These -- in this way, and be seriously debated.
But I'm not going to get into handicapping the campaign. I can tell you what questions I think you should ask, how you should analyze it. But there is no perfect solution here, and I'm glad that the two candidates in the Democratic Party are debating it. . . .
 
Q. One of things left on your plate for next year is pushing the historic trade agreement with China on Capitol Hill. China's labor standards are clearly not what you and the world community would wish for. And the question is will it be difficult for you to sell that to members of your own party in Congress? And, more broadly, what do you think are the prospects for Congress's approving the W.T.O. accord with China?
 
A. Well, in our caucus, some are for it, some are against it, and some have questions. We have a good deal of support for it and a good deal of opposition to it, and then some have questions. But I'm going to make an all-out effort to pass it.
I think -- and I'll come back to your labor question in a minute -- I think it is plainly in America's interest. We gave up nothing in terms of market access to get this, and it's very important that you understand that. What we gave in this was our assent to China's joining the W.T.O. What we got in return were much more market access from everything from farmers to people in the telecommunications industry. This is a huge economic benefit to the people of the United States. Plus we have a big and growing trade deficit with China. We got specific protections on dumping and antisurge protections. So it is in the economic interest of the United States.
Secondly, it is in the strategic interest of the United States. One of the great questions of the next several decades, as China's economy grows to match the size of its population, is whether China and the United States will have a constructive relationship or be at odds. I believe that just as we work together in the United Nations, even though we sometimes disagree, we will work together in the W.T.O.
I think having China in a rule-based system for the international economy is profoundly important, and I think it would be a terrible mistake not to do it.
Now, do I agree with all their labor standards? No. But we shouldn't impose conditions of membership on China that we don't impose on any other country to get in the W.T.O. What we should do, in my judgment, is go back to the American position. We ought to begin a dialogue on these labor initiatives within the W.T.O. That's all we asked for. And then we ought to get everybody to ratify the International Convention on Child Labor and observe it and deal with the other, most egregious forms of labor abuses in the world. That is the right way to proceed here. . . .
 
Q. I have another question on the issue of race, and it's on your record of appointing minorities to top-level jobs in your administration. You have talked throughout your career about the importance of diversity and inclusion. And setting aside your cabinet and federal-bench appointees, the top seven West Wing jobs in your administration have all been held by whites. Twenty-six people have had the job ----
 
A. I disagree with that. What are they?
 
Q. Well, chief of staff, national security, domestic policy, economic advisers, White House counsel, press secretary, senior adviser/counselor. All those jobs have been held by -- not a single person of color has held any of those jobs, and I wonder if you could tell us why?
 
A. Well, first of all, you might be interested to know there were a couple of people of color that I tried to get to do those jobs that preferred other jobs in the administration. And they had, they had, jobs they liked better. And I have -- you didn't point out that a lot of those jobs have been held by women that also have never held those jobs before I came along. And I think that, you know, I think if all I can tell you is I have never not tried to recruit minorities for any job that was open in the White House and I have never followed a quota system. I've had more blacks who've served in my cabinet, more Hispanics who've served in my cabinet. More people, more people from Asia have been appointed in my administration than any previous administration by far. It's not even close.
So there was never a decision made. I now have a Hispanic woman who is my deputy chief of staff. So I never thought about those seven jobs to the exclusion of others. I've tried to make sure that this senior job. My political director is an African-American woman. Alexis Herman, before she became secretary of labor, was head of public liaison. I was unaware that those were the seven most important jobs in my cabinet, I mean, in the White House, in the way that you said them.

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES;
Using Every Trick in Fighting Sweatshops

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
YOU know you are in the presence of a certain kind of labor advocate when he begins to talk about the effective use of nuns as weapons.
"The companies really, really hate it when the nuns get involved and start writing letters," said Charles Kernaghan, smiling maliciously from behind round glasses that reflected the light of a solitary desk lamp he had turned on in his darkened office one night last week. 
 "I mean, what are they going to say against nuns, right?"
Mr. Kernaghan is the executive director of the National Labor Committee, which, despite its name, is not national at all, but a crowded, cluttered bunch of offices in the Garment District from which Mr. Kernaghan and five other people direct a militant, low-budget, much-criticized campaign against the use of sweatshop labor by large companies.
Mr. Kernaghan led a reporter through the offices, trying not to step on the high school students who were spread across the floor painting picket signs for an anti-sweatshop protest march planned for today along Fifth Avenue.
He cleared tangled piles of brand-new sweat pants and blouses and baby clothes from his couch. (He lugs these clothes around the country to use as props during speeches, comparing the retail price to the wages paid to the foreign workers who assemble the clothes.)
He had just returned from Seattle, where he went as a guest of the United Steelworkers of America. But while he was there, he broke off from the labor march and locked arms with students who were blocking hotels to protest the meeting of the World Trade Organization.
For a gloomy sort of man -- the kind who loves Kafka and Sartre and describes the empty feeling he gets even after he wins public relations wars with big companies -- Seattle was a vision of a world the way Charles Kernaghan would like it.
Except for the violence, which he condemned and would have liked to stop -- "But I was not going to get killed defending a Starbucks," he says -- the protests were the kind that Mr. Kernaghan thought died out not long after he helped shut down Loyola University of Chicago as an undergraduate in the late 1960's.
"Issues that no one in the United States really knew about -- except a tiny little minority of people -- now it's out there all across the country because of Seattle," he says. "It's like the Kathie Lee thing: now people are thinking about this."
THE "Kathie Lee thing" -- his unlikely connection with Kathie Lee Gifford, the talk show host -- is, in a way, the beginning of any story about Mr. Kernaghan, a 51-year old former psychology teacher and self-described perpetual graduate student who worked as, among many other things, a taxi driver, a carpenter, a truck unloader and a photographer before almost wandering into labor rights.
But three years ago, when he told a Congressional committee that 15-year-old girls were earning 31 cents an hour and working 75-hour weeks in a Honduran factory that made Mrs. Gifford's sportswear, he set off a makeshift publicity campaign that brought more attention to sweatshops than any other.
Mr. Kernaghan, who spent most of an interview this week talking nonstop while staring at a pen he was twisting with both hands, is the first to admit that he can be overzealous and even unfair and that his facts can sometimes be a little off.
"I'm not a trained economist. I don't come from an organizing background. I don't speak Spanish. I don't use a computer. I don't really like talking on the phone. I can't raise money. And I can't network."
He adds, "But I often think that the reason why the work is successful in some ways is because it was a mistake that I came into it."
As he tells the brief version of his life story, though, it becomes clear that it was not much of a mistake. He grew up in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and then Valley Stream, N.Y., the son of a construction supervisor who emigrated from Scotland. His parents were strong Catholics who took in foster children and presented religion to him as a way of thinking about how to treat other people. "It made me a radical," he says, "really from the time I was a child."
He became interested in psychology early on, mostly to figure out "how the society operates and why certain people get shafted." But after studying it for years and then helping to teach it as a graduate assistant at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh, one day he looked out the window of a classroom and thought to himself, "I just can't do this anymore."
And so he quit and got into his car and drove until he stopped driving. He got out at a pretty town of about 50 people in Pennsylvania called Ohiopyle, where he rented a house and dragged a picnic table into the woods and began to read (mostly Sartre and Kafka).
Later, he worked just enough to earn money to wander the world, and by the time he got to El Salvador in the mid-1980's, where he saw working conditions firsthand, he knew what he was going to do. (He now lives in an apartment in the East Village with Barbara Briggs, who also helps run the campaign.)
Where does Mr. Kernaghan go from here? He wants to get better at raising money, so he can hire more people and go after more companies.
"The big foundations won't touch us with a 10-foot pole," he says. "And I'll tell you, if we were doing whales or penguins, we would be funded up the gazoo."

HEADLINE: Transit Strike Next Week Is Called a Possibility by Experts

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
With less than a week to go before a strike deadline, an unusual confluence of factors makes a walkout by New York City's transit workers more likely now than at any time in the past two decades, union members and government officials say.
These experts said a subway and bus strike, though unlikely, remained a distinct possibility. And a strike in chilly December, during the holiday shopping season, they said, would disrupt the city far more than the union's last strike, an 11-day walkout in April 1980. 
 New York City officials say privately that their biggest fear as the new year approaches is not Year 2000 computer problems, not New Year's Eve crowds, but a strike affecting the city's 3.5 million daily transit riders. City officials have developed an elaborate 61-page contingency plan that includes allowing taxis to pick up multiple fares, and reversing the direction of traffic flow on major avenues during rush hour.
In an interview before negotiations resumed yesterday morning, Willie James, president of the union, which represents 33,000 subway and bus workers, called New York City Transit's wage offer last week an "insult" and threatened a strike.
"It doesn't look good at this juncture," said Mr. James, president of Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union. "If they're really serious, they better come up with something better than their latest offer because if they don't, I can't predict what would happen."
While Mr. James's tough talk might be calculated bluster aimed at intimidating transit officials, his tone is far tougher than it was in negotiations three years ago. The city's other municipal unions, representing nearly 300,000 workers, are urging him to take a tough bargaining stance because the transit contract could set a pattern for all of the city's other workers
A walkout could begin when the transit workers' contract expires at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, although New York State's Taylor Law prohibits strikes by transit workers and other government employees.
During the 1980 strike, when the city experienced severe traffic jams, the union was fined $1.25 million for flouting the law, and Mayor Edward I. Koch hailed commuters who took advantage of the spring weather by walking across the Brooklyn Bridge.
"A strike now would be worse than in 1980," said Gene Russianoff, the staff attorney for the Straphangers Campaign, a transit riders' advocacy group. "It's one thing to walk across the Brooklyn Bridge in the spring, and it's another thing to do it in December when the weather's a lot harsher. I think a strike will mean severe hardship for working people. Some people will face real physical hardship getting to their jobs."
At a boisterous but peaceful rally yesterday in front of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's headquarters at Madison Avenue and 44th Street, 12,000 transit workers and their labor allies, according to police estimates, demonstrated and shouted for a generous contract. Carrying signs that read Show Us the Money, and Y2K Dec. 15, many union members blew whistles and air horns and said they were ready to walk off their jobs if transit officials made an unsatisfactory offer.
Labor experts say the chances of a strike are considerably greater than in recent rounds of negotiations because so many union members are livid about their current contract and because Mr. James faces an electoral challenge from a militant dissident faction that nearly defeated him last year.
"A strike is certainly more likely than five or 10 years ago," said Josh Freeman, a Queens College professor who is writing a book on the history of New York City's labor movement. "The union's top leadership is definitely taking a more militant stance than it has in recent years."
Mr. James's union, like the city's whole labor movement, has grown more combative, fueled in part by the more assertive tone of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and its president, John J. Sweeney, whose father was a New York City bus driver and a member of the Transport Workers Union. Mr. Sweeney talks in reverential tones about Michael J. Quill, the founder of Mr. James's union, who went to jail for leading a transit strike that began on New Year's Day 1966.
Several factors weigh against a strike, labor experts say, including fears of hefty fines, of alienating the public and of crossing swords with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. The public often turns angry when city workers strike, and applies pressure to reduce the offer on the table as punishment.
In a news briefing yesterday, Mr. Giuliani said, "We have all kinds of contingency plans for all kinds of eventualities."
He said the city did not want to unduly frighten people about a strike, although he suggested that the two sides go into round-the-clock bargaining. Labor leaders and transit officials are scheduled to sequester themselves at the Grand Hyatt Hotel on Sunday to begin continuous talks until the strike deadline.
Mr. James negotiated the union's current contract, when New York City Transit was complaining of a budget deficit, and he agreed to a 3.2 percent raise in the first year, a lump-sum payment in the second year and a 3.75 percent wage in the third year.
That contract was ratified by a small margin, and with the city's economy booming, many union members are angry about receiving a lump-sump payment rather than a raise. Many say they feel they were tricked, because in their view they agreed to a modest wage increase, only to discover afterward that, according to many fiscal experts, the transit agency had a surplus of more than $200 million the following year.
"Our current contract stinks," said Delano Derek, a subway conductor who was at yesterday's rally. "For the last two contracts, they shoved it down our throat that the city was broke. Our eyes are not blind, our ears are not deaf, we know the city is doing better and we want our fair due. And I don't mind a strike if that's what it takes to get it."
The transit workers' frustration is complicating the negotiations. Like millions of other workers, they are angry that their wages have risen only a scant few percent when Wall Street is booming, stretch limousines seem to be at every corner and the city and nation are teeming with more millionaires than ever.
Mr. James said that to show his flexibility he reduced his demands to a 9 percent increase over each of three years, down from his original proposal for a 10 percent annual increase. He said the transit authority's latest offer was for a 9.25 percent wage increase over four years -- an offer he said was "an insult considering that we paid our dues in the last contract."
Disagreeing on the numbers, Marc V. Shaw, the M.T.A.'s executive director, said in an interview that New York City Transit's latest offer comes to 12 percent. He said that figure included a 9.5 percent wage increase and another 2.3 percent of each worker's salary that the authority would pay into the pension fund.
"This proposal is fair and reasonable," Mr. Shaw said. "It deals with inflation. It deals with their issues on pensions. It's a comprehensive offer. We're not looking to snooker anybody."
One transit official said the union was making unrealistic demands that would expand the deficits New York City Transit projects for its operations in future years.
Transit officials insist that their surplus is illusory, noting that fare box revenue covers less than 70 percent of their operating costs. Other government money, including a dedicated stream of revenue from the sales tax, put New York City Transit's budget into the black.
"The perception among the transit workers is, 'We agreed to a tough settlement in '96, and the transit authority has a lot of dough and now here's our shot,' " said Mr. Russianoff of the Straphangers Campaign.

HEADLINE: Ending the Brutality in Chechnya

 BODY:
In the name of combating terrorism, Russian troops are threatening to destroy anyone who does not, or cannot, leave the Chechen capital of Grozny. Of the more than 20,000 residents, who remain huddled in rooms without heat, light or even windows, many are too old or frightened to leave. Most of these holdouts are innocent bystanders, far from the "bandits" who are the declared targets of Kremlin leaders. It is time for Russia to show restraint, to start making certain its armies observe basic humanitarian principles and to begin searching for a way out of this tragic war.
The global outrage about Russian killing of civilians in Chechnya comes as Russians prepare to elect a new Parliament on Dec. 19, and with each round of international censure, anti-Westerners move up in the polls. Thus some analysts suggest that any political settlement in Chechnya cannot occur until after that date. This pressure makes the public statements of Russian leaders more understandable, but it does not relieve them of the obligation to stop troops from razing Grozny and indiscriminately killing innocent civilians. 
 This military strategy, as President Clinton noted, does not work, since it punishes Chechen civilians more than the Chechen rebels. With every Russian abuse, Chechen moderates also become more radical. Moreover, the carnage, increasingly visible on television throughout the world, damages Russia's stature as other nations come to recognize habits from its authoritarian past.
Mr. Clinton said at his news conference yesterday that he saw no workable way to impose international sanctions, since Russia has a veto in the United Nations Security Council. He argued that cutting United States aid that helps dismantle nuclear weapons or promotes democratic capitalism was not in America's best interest. The International Monetary Fund, however, has continued to delay a $640 million credit for Russia. Though the I.M.F. insists that its action is based solely on financial grounds, the delay rightly serves notice to Moscow that Western help is not entirely unconditional.
The Russians rained thousands of leaflets on Grozny this week declaring to Chechens on the ground: "You have lost!" Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and other Russian leaders should pay attention to their own message, declare their military operation at an end and quickly find a route to a political settlement.

HEADLINE: Albany Lawmakers Consider Raising Tobacco Tax

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Dec. 8

 BODY:
Negotiators for Gov. George E. Pataki and the Legislature are considering an increase in the state's cigarette tax of at least 25 cents a pack to pay for a health care plan that would expand medical coverage for low-income New Yorkers, according to people involved in the discussions.
The talks are being driven by several factors: the looming expiration of a state law that imposes surcharges on hospitals bills to pay for care of the poor and the training of young doctors; a consensus in Albany to use a significant part of the money from the national tobacco settlement on health care; and a growing recognition among lawmakers that something should be done for the more than three million uninsured New Yorkers. 
 People close to the talks say an agreement could be reached this week, but they caution that a long list of issues remain, like the governor's call for holding the line on Medicaid spending and the demand by Democrats and labor unions for a plan that would cover most of the uninsured, rather than a smaller percentage of them, as Republican lawmakers have proposed.
At the center of the negotiations is a state law that adds $2.6 billion in surcharges to hospital bills, largely to help hospitals train doctors who are just out of medical school and to care for poor people who are not insured. The law expires on Dec. 31, and it would be a crushing financial blow to the state's hospitals if it were not renewed.
In the current negotiations, Democrats are calling for the state to provide coverage directly for the uninsured, starting with about 300,000 people. But Mr. Pataki's aides are concerned that such a plan would encourage private employers to stop paying for their workers' medical insurance and instead let the state provide it, people close to the negotiations said.
The governor wants to provide coverage mostly for the unemployed while providing incentives for private employers to expand coverage for their workers.
The lawmakers must also agree on how to pay for their plans.
All sides agree that some of the money will come from the $500 million a year that New York State expects to receive from the settlement of the national lawsuit against tobacco companies. But there are already competing plans being discussed for that money -- the State Senate, for instance, wants to subsidize the cost of prescription drugs for the elderly -- and what is left is not nearly enough to pay for the kinds of coverage for the uninsured that state leaders are negotiating.
That, in turn, has prompted negotiators for Mr. Pataki and legislative leaders to consider raising the state cigarette tax, now 56 cents a pack, according to the people involved in the negotiations. The increase was initially proposed by leaders of 1199, the hospitals and health care employees union, a major player in the negotiations.
The size of the tax increase has not been determined, but one proposal under serious consideration would increase it by at least 25 cents a pack, which would generate more than $250 million in revenue for the state.
By approving such a measure, the governor and lawmakers would be addressing criticism that the state government has been reluctant to cross the tobacco industry by approving tougher antismoking measures.
The state last adopted a significant antismoking law in 1993, when lawmakers raised the cigarette tax to 56 cents a pack, from 39 cents. At the time, that was the highest rate in the country, but 13 other states have since adopted higher ones. If the tax in New York were raised by 25 cents, to 81 cents a pack, it would be the highest in the region. New Jersey's cigarette tax is 80 cents a pack, and Connecticut's is 50 cents. Hawaii and Alaska, on the other hand, impose a cigarette tax of $1 a pack.
If New York State raises its tobacco tax, it will also mark the first time that Mr. Pataki and the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, both Republicans, have agreed to a tax increase since they rose to power five years ago. Both are well known as enthusiastic tax-cutters, which could give them any political cover they might need for such an increase. A new tobacco tax would also put Mr. Bruno and Mr. Pataki in front of an issue -- the fight against tobacco -- that has been led mostly by Democrats. Antitobacco groups have long contended that the additional tax will discourage thousands of teenagers from ever smoking and will encourage thousands more people, including many adults, to quit.
But the tobacco industry has long opposed tax increases, saying they depress sales perhaps more than any other tobacco restriction. The industry also says that such a tax is regressive, hitting the poorest consumers the hardest, and that it encourages the smuggling of cigarettes from states with lower taxes.
The tax increase would be a particular blow to Philip Morris, the world's largest cigarette maker, which has long wielded great influence in Albany. But in recent months, the company has come under fire after disclosures that it has spent lavishly on gifts for scores of lawmakers.
The talks hinge on Mr. Pataki's demand to limit sharply the annual growth in Medicaid spending, the people involved in the talks said. The governor is pushing his Democratic rivals in the Legislature to cut steeply the anticipated rate of growth in Medicaid spending as part of a deal to preserve the system of surcharges that expire later this month and to expand medical coverage for the uninsured.
The size of the cuts that Mr. Pataki is seeking is not clear. But according to the people involved in the negotiations, he wants at least to maintain previously enacted spending cuts that are due to expire on April 1. If the cuts are not extended, the program would grow by more than $1 billion a year in federal, state and local financing for the program.
The state's Medicaid program, which pays for medical care for the poor and the elderly, represents the largest part of the state budget, totaling about $28 billion a year.
Mr. Pataki has proposed similar cuts in the past, only to see Democrats who control the Assembly block them. But this time, Democrats have not ruled out his proposal.
The governor's powerful allies in the business community have urged him to cut sharply the surcharges that the state now imposes on hospital bills, contending that employers end up paying most of them through higher insurance premiums for workers. But no such plan appears to be under discussion, at least at the moment.

Great Game's Victims

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The newly emboldened Russian military has now embarked on a modern version of what Rudyard Kipling in 1901 called "the Great Game" -- that struggle against the West for economic and political power in the Caucasus and Middle East.
A war on terrorism out of Chechnya is its excuse. Next week's elections to the Russian Parliament are the immediate cause of the systematic massacre of the dark-skinned Muslim troublemakers. The blood-thirstiest of the Russian politicians are getting the most support, if we can believe the easily rigged polls. 
 But there is another, longer-range game afoot. That is the old imperialist urge by Moscow to dominate the sources and lines of supply of Caspian Basin and Iranian oil and gas, and thereby to gain a stranglehold on the economic life of its adversaries.
A map tells the story. Chechnya lies astride one of the key pipelines into Russia and out to a Black Sea port through Turkey's Bosporus to the Mediterranean. That's why Moscow says it must be denied independence, no matter how many die.
The U.S., aware of Russia's ambitions, is encouraging an alternative to supply lines through Iran, Iraq and Russia. We support a proposed energy trail through Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey. Although it has not happened, President Clinton said yesterday it would be seen as "one of the most important things that happened this year."
Russia is putting great pressure on Georgia, independent after the breakup of the Soviet Union. Adjacent to Chechnya, Georgia has been resisting occupation by Russian troops who want to take charge of its border; that would undermine the West's proposed pipeline. Georgia's reformist president, Eduard Shevardnadze, has survived three assassination attempts that many think were K.G.B.-inspired.
Moscow recently entertained Tariq Aziz, Saddam Hussein's man. In return for Russia's support in resisting U.N. inspection of its nuclear weapon development, Iraq has cut its permitted production of oil. That has helped keep up the price of oil -- it has doubled this year -- and has given Russia the money it needs to support 100,000 troops in Chechnya.
Those are the undercurrent events. On the surface, residents of besieged Grozny, the Chechen capital, have been ordered to get out of town lest they be pulverized by bombs -- but no cease-fire was offered to let them get out safely. Thousands will die along with relatively few terrorists.
One Baltic leader said this was like answering the terrorist hijacking of an aircraft by shooting down the plane. Clinton sternly warned that such slaughter of civilians would mean "Russia will pay a heavy price for those actions."
What price? Only that its threatened atrocity "will further alienate the global community from Russia." What a weak-kneed response. The time to list the consequences is before the massacre. Such as:
1. Disinvite the Russians from next week's scheduled meeting of the Group of 8 foreign ministers.
2. Dispatch a trade-and-aid delegation to Georgia immediately.
3. Describe the suspension of the next I.M.F. loan to Russia for what it is -- retaliation for atrocity, and not for economic inaction that saves Russia's face.
4. Withdraw our scheduled Export-Import Bank guarantees.
5. Point out how Arab oil producers, now paying lip service to their Muslim brethren in Chechnya, are financing Russia's attack with their OPEC-induced shortages and inflated oil prices.
6. Begin drawing down oil from our brimming strategic reserve, replenishing the reserve when world prices drop.
7. Move quickly to bring the Baltic states into NATO. Russian imperialism is still alive and growling.
Russia has a way of responding to credible threats. What happened when John McCain and George W. Bush made plain they would withdraw from the ABM treaty if the Russians refused necessary modifications to allow limited missile defense? Russia's Duma, after four years, decided to take up ratification of Start II.
Cluck-clucking and hand-wringing have no effect. Mass killing is no game, great or otherwise. Diplomatic and economic pressure can save lives.

HEADLINE: TAKING THE CHILDREN;
A Pair of Westward Journeys By Mothers and Daughters

BYLINE: By Peter M. Nichols 

 BODY:

Tumbleweeds
 
Janet McTeer, Kimberly J. Brown, Jay O. Sanders, Gavin O'Connor
Directed by Mr. O'Connor
PG-13 -- 100 minutes 
 One of two greatly similar films now in circulation (the other being "Anywhere but Here"), "Tumbleweeds" joins Mary Jo Walker (Ms. McTeer) as she is bailing out of her umpteenth violently abusive relationship. Shooing her 12-year-old daughter, Ava (Ms. Brown), into a battered car, Mary Jo heads off vaguely toward Arizona with a stop in Jefferson City, Mo., where she plans to snare a man whom she knew in high school. "Now he finally can have me," she tells her daughter.
A sweet young girl, Ava is appalled, but being deeply attached to her mother she goes along as gamely as she can. When the Missouri man is less than advertised, Mary Jo heads for California. A lusty, good-looking woman with a roving eye, she is fond of tossing clothing out the car window and yelling, "Yahoo!" Near San Diego, they go swimming and take up housekeeping with Jack (Mr. O'Connor), a conservative, bossy truck driver, and Mary Jo enchants a school chum of Ava's. "I love your life and your four marriages, and I think it's so great," the girl exclaims.
The resilient Ava blossoms and wins the role of Romeo in a school play. Mary Jo drops Jack, and mother and daughter benefit from a friendship with Dan (Mr. Sanders), a worthy, kindly fellow. Nevertheless, Mary Jo is itching to head for Arizona, the primary reason being that she no longer has a boyfriend. But then Ava makes a stand.
 
VIOLENCE -- Domestic brawls include smashed dishes and a threatened punch or two, though the men seem more laughable than menacing.
SEX -- An intensely physical woman, Mary Jo is ready to erupt around any man, but sexual situations are discreet.
PROFANITY -- Quite a bit, but fitting given the people and the stress they often are under.
 
For Which Children?
 
AGES 3-10 -- Older children in this bracket will relate to Ava, but the film is a little too gamey for very young viewers.
AGES 11-13 -- This is a hands-on mother-daughter relationship between two people who totally and wildly love each other. Children will be enticed, and, though parents may disagree, language and sexual situations shouldn't be a problem.
AGES 14 AND UP -- Many girls will be engaged, as will their mothers.
 
Anywhere but Here
 
Susan Sarandon, Natalie Portman, Eileen Ryan, Ray Baker, John Diehl, Shawn Hatosy, Bonnie Bedelia
Directed by Wayne Wang
PG-13 -- 113 minutes
Take "Tumbleweeds," make the mother slightly more fragile and the daughter much more mature, and you have "Anywhere but Here." Ready for a change of men and scene, Adele August (Ms. Sarandon) packs her 14-year-old daughter, Ann (Ms. Portman), in an old Mercedes she can't afford and vacates home in Bay City, Wis., for what she presumes will be a larger, more exciting existence in Beverly Hills, Calif. Out there, or so the narcissistic Adele supposes, she and Ann will suddenly be visited by a rosier reality.
Ann, miserable about leaving home and skeptical of her mother's judgment, has a clearer view. "You're a crazy, unemployed middle-aged schoolteacher with a child to support," she tells her mother after life hasn't proved particularly elevating in Los Angeles. By then the manically impulsive Adele has tired of her job as a speech pathologist and been badly burned by a smirking womanizer she meets at the beach.
Being the more adult of the two, Ann hunkers down over the next couple of years and makes the best of a painful and often chaotic situation by building solid friendships at school and doing well enough academically to get into Brown University with a financial package that is almost adequate to allow her to attend in the fall. Almost. Adele, clinging to her daughter in childish desperation, uses the expense issue to rule out Ann's getting away from her by going East. In the end, though, even Adele tries growing up.
 
VIOLENCE -- None.
SEX -- Adele gushingly tells the long-suffering Ann about her experience in bed with her friend from the beach. Ann undertakes some gentle sexual exploration with a schoolmate, though nothing is explicit.
PROFANITY -- The usual run of profanity, but not excessive.
FOOTNOTE -- It's interesting to watch Ann, who is older and much less dependent on her mother than Ava is in "Tumbleweeds," try to sustain a woman who in many ways is more of a child than she is.
 
For Which Children?
 
AGES 3-10 -- No.
AGES 11-13 -- Ms. Portman makes an appealing, competent heroine, and by this age viewers will be caught up in her problems.
AGES 14 AND UP -- Many older teenagers will also relate to Ms. Portman and the scenario.
 
Liberty Heights
 
Adrien Brody, Bebe Neuwirth, Joe Mantegna, Ben Foster, Justin Chambers, Orlando Jones, Rebekah Johnson
Directed by Barry Levinson
R -- 134 minutes
In another of his Baltimore films, Mr. Levinson goes back to the 50's for a story of growing up Jewish in a time and place that played hob with pat notions of ethnicity. "Get ready, folks, Jews are coming," says someone in a carload of Jewish youths arriving at a high school party full of people fresh from a country club with a sign at the entrance reading "No Jews, dogs or coloreds allowed."
Ben (Mr. Foster), a smart, cool Jewish boy who dresses up like Hitler for Halloween just to see the reaction, and his older brother Van (Mr. Brody) take their chances in a rapidly emerging multicultural society. In one very nice development, and a horrifying one to their parents, Ben begins a chaste but sexually loaded friendship with Sylvia (Ms. Johnson), an equally bright middle-class black girl.
"Just kill me now," says Ada (Ms. Neuwirth), Ben and Van's mother, at news of her sons' interethnic adventures. Their father, Nate (Mr. Mantegna), runs a burlesque house and a numbers business, which provide well for the family until a black drug dealer, Little Melvin (Mr. Jones), hits a bonus bet that wipes Nate out and leads to criminal charges.
But Nate remains ever the gentleman and devoted husband and father. And through these people an era comes delightfully alive.
 
VIOLENCE -- There is a fist fight, and Little Melvin waves a gun around after kidnapping Ben and Sylvia.
SEX -- Some situations, none graphic, many references, and flashes of nudity at the burlesque house.
PROFANITY -- Obscenities fly now and then, but they are never gratuitous.
 
For Which Children?
 
UNDER AGE 10 -- Not a good idea.
AGES 11-13 -- For all the 50's motif, these are characters for any era. Many 90's children will thoroughly enjoy this film, but parents could well object.
AGES 14 AND UP -- This is one R-rated film that should get a clean bill of health.

HEADLINE: New East-West Highway Studied for North Country

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WATERTOWN, N.Y., Dec. 9

 BODY:
Take a map and trace a line between Watertown and Plattsburgh, across extreme northern New York.
It would show a 170-mile route along the state's geographic and economic fringes, passing through areas where unemployment is high, real estate values and per capita incomes are low, and communities are small and sparsely populated. 
 The region's most reliable industries are its 14 state prisons, but people like Victor Perry look at the territory between Watertown and Plattsburgh and see potential that could be unlocked by construction of a four-lane, limited-access highway.
"It has been something that has been preached and talked about and it has to become a reality if we are to survive," Mr. Perry said.
"It" is the project that has been known as the Rooftop Highway for the nearly two generations in which it has been discussed across the St. Lawrence Valley in New York. The most serious study ever of the idea, financed under the auspices of the Development Authority of the North Country with $1.5 million in federal money, is expected to be completed by late next year.
The study is examining the feasibility of what would be a highway link between Interstate 87 in or near Plattsburgh and the northern end of Interstate 81, just above Watertown.
"If they are sincere about helping the North Country, that is the best way to do it," said Mr. Perry. Business interests say the two primary east-west roadways in northern New York, scenic as they can be, have ill served the industries and the tourism trade across the region. Both of them, U.S. 11, between Watertown and Champlain, and State Route 37, north of U.S. 11 between Watertown and Malone, where it meets U.S. 11, are two-lane roads with many traffic signals.
"We are kind of at the end of the line," said the mayor of Massena, Kenneth MacDonnell, whose village is home to General Motors, Alcoa and Reynolds Aluminum factories. "The state and the country end here."
Representative John McHugh, a Republican from the western portion of the North Country, said the timber and paper industries and agriculture have also suffered without a nearby four-lane highway to ease the movement of goods and supplies.
Representative McHugh, who was chiefly responsible for securing the money in Congress to conduct the study, said the economic benefits of a Rooftop Highway are obvious. "The level of the transportation systems in our part of the world inhibits economic expansion and development," he said.
A bill providing for construction of the highway was passed by the State Legislature in the early 1960's, but was vetoed as too expensive by Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller. The state later recommended that the roadway be included in the national Interstate highway system, which would have meant most of the cost would be paid with federal funds, but that proposal was rejected by the federal government.
The rule of thumb is that it costs about $8 million per mile to build a four-lane limited access highway. By that measure, a Rooftop Highway would cost more than $1 billion.
The Pataki administration supports studying the feasibility of a Rooftop Highway, said Michael Fleisher, a spokesman for the State Transportation Department.
So does Hillary Rodham Clinton, a likely candidate for the United States Senate. During a forum in Watertown in September, she agreed with local leaders that the North Country has not shared in the prosperity of the nation as a whole and she said the region's road system was one drawback.
"I think transportation is a key," she said.
The route the highway should take, if it is built, is already being debated. If it shadows Route 37, the highway would serve Ogdensburg and Massena but bypass Gouverneur and Potsdam. If it follows Route 11 more closely, the roadway would be 20 miles from Ogdensburg or Massena.
Though the roadway would pass close to the northern boundaries of the state's Adirondack Park, environmentalists have expressed no opposition to the proposal so far. In fact, Neil Woodworth of the Adirondack Mountain Club said the highway could make the western Adirondacks more accessible for hiking and camping and relieve congestion on trails in eastern sections of the park.

HEADLINE: Many Homeowners Now Pay Someone to Put Rudolph Up on the Rooftop

BYLINE: By KATE STONE LOMBARDI 

DATELINE: CHAPPAQUA, N.Y., Dec. 9

 BODY:
First, it looked as if all nine reindeer might not fit on the roof. Then the lights on the sleigh blew out, plunging half the roof into darkness.
The Norway spruce in front of the house had grown so tall that it took nearly 4,000 bulbs to light it, and an aerial lift truck had to be called in to wrap strands of lights around the top branches. 
 Clearly, decorating Bill Shaw's house for Christmas is not a job for amateurs. Which is why for the last five years, Mr. Shaw hired professionals to help him put up the outdoor display of lights, sculptures and garlands that has made his house a local attraction during the holiday season.
Mr. Shaw has company. In an effort to create the kind of spectacular effects once reserved for Rockefeller Center, more homeowners are hiring professionals, usually tree care companies that moonlight in Christmas decorations, to install thousands of twinkling lights.
The companies bring in aerial lift trucks, orchard ladders and tree climbers, often working with electrical contractors who dig trenches and run underground wires to the trees and shrubbery.
Tree care professionals said that they began to get requests for professional help about 10 years ago and that the requests have picked up in the last 5 years.
They see several reasons for the increase. The booming economy has allowed homeowners to become more ambitious in their decorating. And as the designs become more elaborate, the displays become more difficult and more dangerous to install.
But more than anything, those in the business credit the trend toward paying for personal services: just as one can pay someone to cater the holiday meal or do the personal shopping, so too can one hire workers to string Christmas lights.
"It seems like lately, the stock market is good and more people are doing it," said Jeff Thrasher with Second Nature Tree and Lawn Care in Stamford, Conn., which has decorated homes in Greenwich, Darien and New Canaan.
"We just did one place completely in a candy cane motif, outlining each tree trunk and branch with bands of red and white lights," Mr. Thrasher said. "The lining of the house is popular, too. If someone has good taste, it can be very stylish."
Not surprisingly, professional displays do not come cheap.
"It's not too difficult to spend $10,000 on decorating a tree, if it's the first time you're doing it," said Daniel Van Starrenburg, president of Savatree in Bedford Hills, N.Y., who did the work on Mr. Shaw's house.
"It's first a question of how passionate you feel and second, how prosperous you feel," Mr. Starrenburg said. "It seems the trend is that people are wanting to do more outrageous and spectacular scenarios."
Costs for professional decorating range dramatically, depending on what kind of equipment and how many hours are required. Some homeowners buy their own lights; others have the tree companies provide the decorations.
Mr. Shaw did his own designing and equipment buying but hired a crew of three men for two days to put everything up. Not only is his entire house outlined with lights but every tree and bush in the front yard is covered. In addition to Santa Claus and the reindeer on the roof, three reindeer and one angel are on the front lawn. The reindeer nod their heads; the angel flaps its wings.
So far this season, Mr. Shaw has bought 128 boxes of replacement lights as well as an additional 23 extension cords. He estimated that he has spent about $7,000 on updating the display, a figure that does not include a generator he had to install, because the power demands would overwhelm his circuit box. His electricity bill during the holiday season? "Don't ask," Mr. Shaw said. "At least triple."
Generally, homeowners decorate evergreen trees with colored lights, while the trend for deciduous trees is to wrap the trunk and each branch with tiny white lights. But aesthetics are not all that is involved: professionals can help with calculations of the wattage required and how many amps each electrical wire can handle.
Since having the lights professionally strung can be expensive, some people have tried to save money by leaving the strands up all year, a practice that tree companies have tried to discourage.
First, arborists say, tight wires can girdle the tree, stopping the flow of sap and damaging growth. The wiring can also be chewed by squirrels, causing electrical shorts. And of course, lights burn out; roughly 40 percent of them have to be replaced each year anyway.
Elaborate decorations are just as vulnerable to accidents as more modest efforts. In other words, if one bulb goes, all of them can go dark.
"That's why you really can't put a lump sum on how much this costs," said Ken Almstead, vice president of Almstead Tree Company in Briarcliff, N.Y., who has worked in Katonah, Scarsdale, New Rochelle and Bronxville.
"Regular outdoor lights aren't great for withstanding winter weather, and let's say we string a great big spruce, one of the strands goes out, we have to come back," Mr. Almstead said. "It's just like the lights on your Christmas tree: when one light goes, everything above it or below it will go, too."
That is what happened last year to Mr. Shaw -- the lights on the Norway spruce had a short and everything had to come down -- but it was not enough to discourage him.
Mr. Shaw, a senior vice president of HRH Construction Corporation in Manhattan, said he started his display small. "I heard Chappaqua was upscale, and I didn't want someone banging on my door," he said.
The display has grown each year and now almost every piece of greenery is lighted. This year, the lawn display is new. Next year, he is hoping to have Santa and his reindeer dangling from a hot air balloon.
Far from complaints, Mr. Shaw said he receives thank-you notes. "It makes people happy and you can't buy that," he said.

HEADLINE: Occupational School to Close After Losing State Tuition Aid

 BODY:
After serving low-income and immigrant students seeking occupational diplomas, the 111-year-old Interboro Institute in Manhattan will shut its doors Friday of next week because of a long-running dispute over whether it should receive state tuition assistance.
The institute, which has been in business since 1888, can no longer pay its bills. It is blaming the State Department of Education for turning off the stream of money. 
 Interboro Institute, with almost a thousand students in its building on West 56th Street, provides entry-level career and occupational education and is authorized by the state to confer the degree of Associate of Occupational Science. The school trains students to be assistants in areas like accounting, business management and paralegal studies.. Many of its students do not have high school degrees and must first complete high school equivalency degrees. Even students with high school degrees often require a program of heavy remedial education.
Affected by the closure will be students like Antyem Mallokandov, who is originally from Russia but now lives in Queens. He is enrolled in Interboro's ophthalmic dispensing program, which teaches students to fill out prescriptions for corrective eyewear.
"I spent two years at Tech," he said, referring to programs he took at New York City Technical College "Now I have to go back there. I thought I was going to finish, now I have to finish again."
Orande Russel, a student originally from Barbados who also lives in Queens, sat looking at the floor and shaking his head over the imminent closing of the school. "I was almost finished. Now I have to start at square one. It just doesn't feel good and I don't know what to do."
Almost all of the students, some of whom are receiving welfare benefits, pay their tuition of roughly $3,400 a year with money from state tuition assistance, and federal assistance, known as Pell grants, aimed at low-income families. If Interboro loses its certification to receive student aid checks, it says, it cannot continue.
Many trade and career schools have been accused over the years of taking government assistance and putting students through their programs who never finish their degrees. Interboro says 15 percent of its students graduate with two-year-degrees, a rate they say is roughly equivalent to other schools serving low-income students.
"This is not some fly-by-night rip- off operation," said Professor Stanley Hoffman who teaches english and composition. "Students who come here have gone on to four-year colleges or gotten jobs."
Interboro's financial problems stretch back at least a decade. An audit of the school by the State Comptroller's Office from 1989 to 1992 found that Interboro violated laws covering the allocation of tuition assistance money and disallowed $4.8 million the school had received. That amount was later reduced to $3.5 million, still money that would have to be paid back to the state.
According to the State Department of Education, there were three major areas of violation. Some of Interboro's students did not live in New York as required. Some students did not take minimum number of courses to be eligible for full-time assistance. And some students had not taken tests from Interboro that were required by the school's admission policy.
In 1996, Interboro began a five-year plan to pay back the state about $800,000 a year plus interest. But in December 1998, the state decided that Interboro was no longer economically viable and should not be eligible to receive state tuition assistance money. It explained that because of Interboro's $1.2 million debt, it was not likely to be eligible to receive Pell grants and so could not go on.
"That took us by surprise," said Rupert A. Jemmott, executive vice president and vice president for academic affairs. "We had no financial problems. We were paying our bills. We were functioning. They withheld funds pending a renegotiation of the payback. Had those funds not been withheld, we would have been fine."
Officials at Interboro said they had been unfairly singled out. "I think there are people in Albany who don't like me and don't like the kinds of students we produce," said Bruce Kalisch, president of Interboro, who has been president since 1987.
Alan Ray, a spokesman for the Department of Education, said the original audit was done completely independently and "the facts are the facts." He dismissed any idea of a vendetta against Mr. Kalisch or the school as "ludicrous."
Interboro has had strained relations before with the Department of Education, whose officials twice tried to shut the school for academic reasons -- concerns over the school's remedial programs and the number of students who had never graduated high school. Those decisions were overturned at the commissioner level.
With the school's closing now imminent, administrators and professors are looking for new schools that will accept Interboro students. But Mr. Kalisch thinks many students will not be accepted elsewhere. Teachers and administrators have been working without pay since December first.
"There is enough blame to go around," said an optics teacher, Gloria Lynch. "I just wish they gave us some money to finish with students already in the pipeline. It's a heartbreaker for so many people."
As she spoke, Ms. Lynch flipped through mementos from students on her desk: a small handmade rug, a hand-carved wooden heart, a letter from Bosnia titled "To one of my favorite teachers."
"It's dismantling my whole life," Ms. Lynch said.

HEADLINE: Social Security Math

 BODY:

To the Editor:
The Social Security Advisory Board is right to point to the unrealistic life expectancy rates used by Congress and others when calculating the health of the Social Security trust fund (news article, Dec. 7). But the board ignores a bigger flaw -- unrealistically low economic projections.
The gloomiest Social Security scenarios are based on projections that the economy will slow to recession levels in coming decades. Even short-term predictions are dire. 
 The board sees growth of only 2.15 percent in the coming year. But in a recent report to Congress, groups like the Office of Management and Budget and Data Resources Inc. had estimates of 2.4 percent to 3.4 percent. We should be using more realistic forecasts.

HEADLINE: William Jackson Dies at 80; Lawyer With Wide Clientele

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
William Eldred Jackson, a New York lawyer with an international clientele that included Nelson A. Rockefeller, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, the King of Morocco and Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza, died on Saturday at his home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. He was 80 and also had a home in Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.
The cause was throat cancer, a family spokesman said. He said Mr. Jackson had continued to go to his office until last week. 
 Mr. Jackson came to the law as a personal assistant to his father, Robert H. Jackson, an associate justice of the Supreme Court appointed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt.
The younger Mr. Jackson, a native of Jamestown, N.Y., was first in his class at St. Albans School in Washington and graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1941 from Yale University, where he was vice chairman of The Yale Daily News. He was an editor of the Harvard Law Review and got his L.L.B. there in 1944.
He then was a lieutenant (j.g.) in the Navy until 1946. He followed Justice Jackson to Germany when his father, on a leave of absence, was America's chief counsel for the prosecution at the Nuremberg trial of major Nazi war criminals. As a staff member, private secretary and law clerk, William Jackson took part in the interrogation of Hermann Goring, Rudolf Hess and Albert Speer. He was co-editor of the eight volumes of trial evidence printed by the American government.
In 1947, he joined the Wall Street law firm of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy, specializing in civil litigation, including arbitration, as well as antitrust actions and international legal disputes. He became a partner in 1954 and was a consulting partner at his death.
He was the personal lawyer for Gov. Nelson Rockefeller of New York in 1974, when President Gerald Ford picked Mr. Rockefeller as his vice president after the Watergate scandal; he counseled Mr. Rockefeller at his confirmation hearings.
Mr. Jackson represented Mrs. Onassis in her negotiations with the Onassis estate after the Greek shipping magnate, Aristotle, her second husband, died in 1975. He also advised Baron Thyssen-Bornemisza, the Swiss industrialist, in the intricate international bargaining before he moved his fabled art collection into its own museum, a stone's throw from the Prado Museum in Madrid.
In the 1970's, Mr. Jackson won two landmark Supreme Court cases for the New York Stock Exchange that established guidelines for class-action cases in the securities industry. He was a past vice chairman of the International Court of Arbitration in the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris.
Mr. Jackson is survived by his wife of 55 years, Nancy Dabney Roosevelt Jackson, a granddaughter of President Theodore Roosevelt; five daughters, Miranda Hook of Fairfield, Conn., Melissa Morgan of Cold Spring Harbor and Melanie Jackson, Melinda Kessler and Marina Jackson, all of Manhattan; and five grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Japan Drops Cornerstone Of Program For Rockets

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 9

 BODY:
In the latest setback for the Japanese space program, the space agency said today that it would abandon its troubledH-2 rocket project, the cornerstone of the program, after a series of costly failures.
The decision will delay the launchings of almost all Japanese satellites for about a year and follows the failed launching last month of the No. 8 H-2 rocket, which plunged into the Pacific shortly after takeoff because of engine trouble. In developing the rocket, Japan sought to free itself from the restrictions that came with relying on the United States for rocket technology and to compete in the commercial satellite-launching market. 
 But the National Space Development Agency said it would immediately halt production of the No. 7 H-2 rocket, which is 90 percent complete at a cost of $160 million. The No. 7 rocket, which despite its designation was the last in the H-2 series, had been scheduled for launching with a communications satellite next year.
The agency said it would focus on the next generation of rocket, H-2A, which the agency said would benefit from past mistakes.
The agency has invested $4.14 billion in the H-2 program, which began in 1986, including $2.7 billion for development and $180 million for each launching.
An aerospace analyst, Fujio Nakano, said the decision to shift focus to the H-2A was a good idea. "With the past H-2 launches," Mr. Nakano said, "we have already accumulated much valuable information that can be used in designing the new rocket model. Considering that this is an investment toward the next-generation rocket technology, 16 billion yen is a small loss."
That total equals $160 million.
The credibility of the space effort was severely damaged on Nov. 15, when the No. 8 H-2 rocket, carrying a government satellite, plunged into the ocean after the first-stage engine stopped firing. That was the second H-2 rocket failure in two years.
The lost rocket and satellite were valued at $340 million. The agency has not determined the cause of the failure.
"While we are still investigating the accident, we decided, considering the cost involved, that we should cancel the No. 7 H-2 and apply the savings and what we learn from the investigation to insuring a successful launching of the H-2A," said a spokesman for the agency, Yasukuki Fukumuro.
Mr. Fukumuro said the agency would save $30 million by devoting its efforts solely to developing the H-2A, which he said has a more advanced engine and more power than its predecessor.
The agency had planned the initial H-2A launching for early next year. But its debut will be delayed for a year to conduct additional ground tests, the agency said. The postponement, along with the cancellation of the No. 7 H-2, will push back the launching of almost every satellite for at least a year.
The agency said it planned to launch the first and second H-2A rockets, which are scheduled to carry a European Space Agency communications satellite and Japanese military satellite, in the summer and winter of 2001.
Mr. Fukumuro said if the initial H-2A launchings were successful, the agency hoped to transfer the technology to the private sector to fulfill the long-term goal of launching commercial satellites. To be competitive, the Japanese plan to offer customers steep discounts on launchings and build a reputation for reliability.
The highly competitive launching industry is dominated by three major players, Boeing's Delta rockets and Lockheed Martin's Atlas rockets, both from the United States, and Ariane rockets made by Arianespace, the European consortium. Russia and China have small parts of the market.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Trying to Put 'Out of Print' Back in Play

BYLINE: By DOREEN CARVAJAL 

 BODY:
Two of the leading players in the book industry announced separate plans yesterday to invest in new instant printing technology that will resurrect out-of-print titles and lead toward more electronic books.
Barnes & Noble said it had struck an agreement with I.B.M. to provide print-on-demand equipment for its distribution centers, which will allow the No. 1-ranked bookstore chain to quickly convert digital books into conventional print versions one at a time. 
 On the same day, Random House Inc. -- the largest trade book publisher in the United States and a unit of Bertelsmann -- said it was also preparing to invest in state-of-the art equipment for its national distribution center in Westminster, Md., that will begin operation in March or April. But unlike Barnes & Noble, it has not yet struck a deal with any of the major manufacturers of the equipment like Xerox or I.B.M.
Most book buyers may not immediately notice the effect of the equipment, but ultimately such moves mean that the depth and selection of titles will increase because publishers will be able to maintain titles economically in digital form, printing titles out in short runs according to demand.
"I think there are roughly 1.3 million titles considered in print, and some 90,000 books are put out of print each year," said Stephen Riggio, vice chairman of Barnes & Noble. "We think that's a travesty. The technology enables us to declare that the words 'out of print' should be obsolete."
Mr. Riggio said the company expected to start offering a range of services to publishers early next year. It has already been working with a pilot group of five small and large publishers to identify titles, Mr. Riggio added.
Random House is going through the first round of examining its out-of-stock titles, which could be brought back to life in digital form and printed with the new technology, said Erik Engstrom, president and chief operating officer for Random House.
The company has a backlist of more than 20,000 titles, but estimates that there are as many as 50,000 titles that are no longer in stock that could be revived, Mr. Engstrom said.
"Most of this will be invisible to the reader," he added. "The only thing a reader is interested in is whether they can find a book or not. With this equipment, we'll have the ability to print any book in our database whenever we want it. When we have this new printer, we'll also have the ability to turn everything around faster."

HEADLINE: Fritz Fischer, 91; German Historian Blamed Germany for First War

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Fritz Fischer, the German historian who rankled his peers and Germans in general with the thesis that Imperial Germany was squarely responsible for World War I and its consequences, died on Dec. 1 in Hamburg. He was 91.
Dr. Fischer, a Hamburg resident, had been a professor emeritus at the University of Hamburg since 1973. 
 He stirred a hornet's nest in 1961 with the proposition that Germany's naked ambition to spread its political and economic domination across Europe and beyond, to Africa, caused the war. What nettled his critics even more was the moderate language and obvious scholarship with which he made his points.
The controversy initially simmered in Hamburg. Then the news magazine Der Spiegel reviewed his book and capsulized its conclusions in 1964. Heated arguments continued for years, although younger German historians later agreed that many of his inferences from contemporary documents had some merit.
Outside his country, Dr. Fischer became Germany's best-known living historian. The book that had caused such commotion was published in the United States as "Germany's Aims in the First World War" (Norton, 1967). Its title was a neutralized version of the German original "The Grasp for World Power," which gave a clearer idea of the author's judgment.
It challenged the traditional view that Germany, like the other great powers, stumbled into the war, and that there were those on all sides who tried to avert it or halt it before it grew into the catastrophe it became. Some modern British historians have also taken the middle view that there was enough blame to go around and that Britain had its share.
Fritz Fischer was born in Ludwigsstadt in Imperial Germany, the son of a railroad inspector. He graduated from the University of Berlin with a doctorate in theology in 1934 and a doctorate in philosophy in 1937. He taught church history in Berlin until 1939, when he joined the history faculty in Hamburg.
In World War II he served with air force ground personnel and was held prisoner two years at the war's end.
He was the author of several more books on World War I and German history and society. Over the years he was a visiting professor at universities throughout Europe, as well as the University of Notre Dame. He was a honorary member of the British Academy and the American Historical Association.
In 1942 he married Margarete Lauth-Volkmann; there was no immediate word on survivors.

HEADLINE: Victor Perlo, 87, Economist For Communist Party in U.S.

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
Victor Perlo, a Marxist economist whose career was damaged by accusations during the Red scare of the late 1940's and early 1950's that he spied for the Soviet Union in Washington during World War II, died Dec. 1 at his home in Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y. He was 87.
Mr. Perlo had difficulty finding work after his loyalty was first challenged in 1947 and then in hearings before the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1948 and the Senate Committee on Internal Security in 1953. 
 But he later developed a business as an economic consultant and university lecturer and wrote 13 books. He was known for his analysis of the political economy of American capitalism, comparative economic systems and what he called the economics of racism in the United States.
In one job after the initial accusations, Mr. Perlo worked on the campaign of Henry A. Wallace, the Progressive Party's presidential candidate in 1948.
From the 1960's until his death, Mr. Perlo, who had a master's degree in mathematics from Columbia University, served as the chief economist of the Communist Party in the United States. He was also a board member of the party.
Mr. Perlo, who worked as an economist in government agencies during the Roosevelt and Truman administrations, denied at the Washington hearings that he had spied for the Soviet Union. But like many who were questioned then by Congressional committees, he invoked the Fifth Amendment and refused to provide some answers.
During one hearing in which he sparred with Senator William E. Jenner, the Indiana Republican who led the Internal Security Committee, Mr. Perlo said he did not want to discuss his reasons for invoking his constitutional privilege. But his wife Ellen said last week that her husband had not wanted to begin a line of response that might lead to his being required to testify against others.
At the time of the hearings, Mr. Perlo said in a statement that "the dragging of my name through the mud is part of a big Roman circus."
Mr. Perlo discovered he had a security problem in 1947 when he was denied a passport he needed to become treasurer of the Intergovernmental Committee on Refugees in Europe. He had resigned a post at the Treasury Department and suddenly found himself unemployed. The next year, he was called before the House Un-American Activities Committee on the basis of a 1945 memorandum from a federal agency in which a woman who said she had been a courier between Communist espionage groups named Mr. Perlo as the head of one of the groups.
Mr. Perlo published his first book, "American Imperialism," in 1951; his most recent, "Economics of Racism II" (International Publishers), came three years ago. He taught at the New School and at the College of New Rochelle and lectured at Harvard and other universities.
Besides his wife, Mr. Perlo is survived by a daughter, Kathy, of Dundee, Scotland; two sons, Stanley of Ithaca, N.Y., and Arthur of New Haven; three grandchildren; and a great-granddaughter.

HEADLINE: Unlikely Allies With the United Nations;
For Big Companies, a Strategic Partnership Opens Doors in Developing Countries

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
When Amoco started drilling for oil in Angola a few years ago, Exxon and Chevron had already landed some of the richest oil fields and could easily outbid their smaller rival for others. Lately, though, Amoco has been the successful bidder on several oil tracts.
Why? The company, which is now BP Amoco, realized that the Angolan government, torn by civil war, was ready to favor any company that was also willing to assist with social projects. So in 1997 Amoco offered to spend $800,000 to help local fishermen revive an abandoned fishing port -- and asked the local office of the United Nations Development Program to manage the project. 
 In the last two years, Amoco and the development program have helped repair or replace about a dozen boats, equipped them with a variety of gear, and recruited a local bank to set up a loan program for the fishermen.
"We didn't know anything about fishing, or managing social projects," said Finda Koroma, then Amoco's director for commercial development and now a consultant in Houston. "Companies don't always understand what the U.N.'s development arms can do for them."
They are understanding it more and more. Across the world, huge companies that once shrugged off the United Nations as a worthy, if often ineffectually bureaucratic, do-good agency are now viewing it as a valuable partner. And the United Nations, for a change, is not only welcoming the companies help but seeking it out.
United Nations agencies rarely troll solely for money. "We are not interested in donations, but in relationships that let us tap into their expertise," said John G. Ruggie, assistant secretary general for strategic planning.
For their part, companies know that if they help the United Nations with its pet projects, it will open doors and act as a valuable buffer between them and the governments of countries in which they wish to operate. For computer and health care companies, which along with the oil companies are leading the trend toward collaboration, it is also a chance to introduce their brands to growing markets, while playing up to agencies that routinely buy their products.
All this is a huge change for the United Nations, which a few years ago was so terrified of losing its patina of impartiality that it turned down an offer from Coca-Cola to help would-be entrepreneurs in poor countries sell beverages at sporting events, lest it seem to be favoring Coke over Pepsi. The United Nations still carefully guards its neutral image; it does not promote specific companies. But now it does not turn its back, either. Instead, it solicits help from all of an industry's players.
"If we can set up a nonexclusive arrangement with a company to co-finance a project, why not?" said Mark Malloch Brown, a former World Bank vice president who has run the development program since July. "It's not like we're saying Microsoft gets Botswana, Corel gets Ghana; we're stimulating competition."
It is tempting to link the new corporate camaraderie to the United Nations' much-publicized financial problems, but it would probably have come about anyway. What had been a trickle of private-sector investment in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, Latin America and other developing economies has become a flood.
In 1990, private sources invested just $43.6 billion in the developing world. In 1997, some $252 billion of private-sector money flowed into developing countries, compared with $77 billion from the World Bank and other public sources.
"If the U.N.'s member countries hadn't gotten past their distaste for foreign investment, we could never have done our own outreach," said Henry Jackelen, director of the development program's private-sector operation. "They realize that the companies are sources of expertise and resources they can't get elsewhere."
Corporate largess to the United Nations is not entirely new, of course. Ted Turner made headlines when he donated $1 billion of stock in 1997. And the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has designated $26 million to help Unicef wipe out tetanus in infants.
But these were philanthropic gifts by individuals whose money was derived from their industrial activities. The new trend is for companies themselves to use United Nations collaboration as a marketing tool, not just a philanthropic one.
"Of course we want to help eradicate neonatal tetanus, but we also want to stimulate the use of nonreusable injection devices, and to build relationships with ministries of health that might buy other products from us as their economies develop," said Gary M. Cohen, president of the medical systems unit of Becton Dickinson & Company. He is working with Unicef -- one of its biggest customers of syringes and other medical devices -- to distribute the company's patented disposable syringes for the same anti-tetanus program the Gates Foundation is supporting.
Nor are the companies confining their giving to their own products and expertise. Many, particularly oil companies, are contributing to United Nations programs on entrepreneurship and human rights, in hopes of promoting stability in countries with civil unrest.
Last year, for example, Chevron, which had been drilling for oil in Kazakhstan for five years, contributed $500,000 toward a business center, run by the United Nations Development Program, that helps Kazakhstanis set up new businesses. Citigroup's Citibank is in on the project, too, helping to run an operation that gives entrepreneurs small loans.
The center, which operates in the same building in the city of Atyrau as Chevron, has already yielded 19 businesses. It helped a local doctor set up a private ambulance service, and a businesswoman rent refrigerators to store and sell ice cream. Now, it is helping locals set up a bowling alley in the region, as well as Atyrau's first supermarket.
"It boils down to our desire to have a stable economic and political environment in which to operate, and to stimulate the local economy," said Philip L. Meek, president of Chevron Munaigas, Chevron's Kazakhstan operation.
Of course, companies could donate products or services without using the United Nations as a go-between. But in many parts of the world, the concept of free enterprise is so new local officials do not know where to begin.
"A bridge to the community was essential in a country that had no real grass-roots civil society before 1989," said Zoltan Valcsicsak, who handles community affairs for Levi Strauss in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Levi Strauss recently funneled $40,000 to the development program to help combat AIDS in Poland, where it has a plant.
Other executives note that United Nations officials understand the sensitivities of governments that do not want to think of themselves as backwards. "The U.N. has been in Russia a lot longer than we have," said John McKeegan, a spokesman for Johnson & Johnson, which recently elicited the development program's help in setting up an educational program for cardiologists in Moscow.
Similarly, Reza Ghaffari, who runs Citibank's offices in Kazakhstan, notes that the development program encouraged local entrepreneurs to take group loans, on the theory that peer pressure would go far in encouraging all members to repay their shares. "We could have just donated the money without bothering to insist on a sustainable initiative," Mr. Ghaffari said, "but this approach will have a greater impact on the community."
And, perhaps the United Nations' most powerful lure of all is that it provides an administrative backbone for projects that companies would just as soon not undertake alone. "Private industry really doesn't have the expertise to run community programs," said Anne Krisitin Sydnes, a vice president of Statoil, the big Norwegian oil company, which hooked up with the development program and Amnesty International last year for a project to train Venezuelan judges on how to deal with human rights issues.
Conversely, the United Nations rarely has the expertise to pull nascent economies into the Internet age. Take the development program's NetAid project, which was kicked off with benefit concerts in New Jersey, London and Geneva on Oct. 9. Unlike Farm Aid and similar fund-raising concerts, NetAid was not a one-shot deal; the development program convinced numerous Internet-related companies that it was to their benefit to help it use the concerts to publicize www.netaid.org, a Web site the development program hopes to parlay into a matchmaking tool for corporations and countries.
Cisco Systems, a major provider of the routers, switches and other equipment that powers the Internet, provided much of the marketing, as well as the technology to enable millions of people to tap into the concerts online. Cisco, in turn, persuaded the accounting and consulting firm KPMG, which it partly owns, to design the Web page. And it persuaded Akamai, a year-old technology company, to contribute its expertise in easing Internet logjams. "It seemed a terrific way to showcase our technology," said an executive at Akamai, which recently went public.
Even so, high-technology involvement is not ending with NetAid. Orientation.com, a New York-based company that runs an advertising-supported network of Internet portals in 20 countries, is providing material for portals that the development program wants to run in an additional 31 countries. "The U.N.D.P. gives us contact with their partners in new countries, and with information that we can use on our other portals," said Tamara Bekefi, a project manager at Orientation .com.
Corel, a software company based in Ottawa, is contributing a suite of business-oriented software for the development program to use in its effort to set up Internet systems in developing countries. Corel's software runs on the Linux operating system, which can be downloaded free from the Internet, and the company is betting that if Web novices get used to Linux now, they are less likely to flock to Windows later. Indeed, Corel has thrown Netscape Navigator, a prime competitor to Microsoft's Internet Explorer, into its package.
"Microsoft is still the clear No. 1, and if we can foster brand loyalty early on, maybe we can level the playing field," said Michael Cowpland, Corel's chief executive.
Other computer companies have similar aims. Rebel.com, a Canadian hardware company that Corel partly owns, believes that computers operated by a free system like Linux are likely to sell well in poorer countries. "Our investment is not under the veil of philanthropy," said Michael Mansfield, president of Rebel.com, which is contributing about $250,000 worth of computers. "It is coming out of our marketing budget."
Such strategic thinking is starting to pervade some United Nations agencies themselves. The Population Fund, which distributes contraceptives in developing countries, is setting up meetings between drug executives and officials in Egypt and India, in hopes of helping the companies overcome high tariffs and other barriers to selling contraceptives there. And the fund expects to set up a Web-based system eventually, one in which governments can buy contraceptives at prices the fund has negotiated.
"We aren't even asking for product donations," said Corrie Shanahan, a spokeswoman for the fund. So why bother? "If the companies sell contraceptives to the middle classes in those countries, it will free up our supply for poor people."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
G.M. Said toBe Ready to Buy Stake in Parent of Subaru

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Dec. 9

 BODY:
Seeking to help its business at home while building its tiny market share in Asia, the General Motors Corporation is expected to announce that it will pay $1.4 billion for 20 percent of Fuji Heavy Industries, the Japanese maker of Subaru vehicles, people close to the talks said today.
The deal, which could be announced as early as Friday, would allow G.M. to share Subaru's expertise in all-wheel-drive systems for small cars, its engineering work on car-based sport utility vehicles and its technology for continuously variable transmissions. In addition, G.M. might tap into Fuji's distribution system in Japan, where G.M. has struggled to sell cars for years. 
 Analysts shrugged off the deal as a minor one for G.M. "It would be a rounding error for G.M. in terms of the cost, in terms of the earnings effect and in terms of the effect on their business," said David B. Healy, an analyst with Burnham Securities. "It could give them a source of engines and maybe save them some development costs and maybe give them a toehold in the Asia-Pacific market."
In the third quarter, G.M.'s market share in the region was 4.6 percent. In the first nine months of this year, G.M.'s revenue in the Asia-Pacific region was $2.25 billion, and it lost $195 million on the business. Those figures are dwarfed by G.M.'s nine-month revenue of $112.63 billion and net income of $4.86 billion.
G.M. acknowledged late today that it had been negotiating with Fuji about "a strategic alliance."
"There has been considerable momentum with those talks, but there is nothing firm to announce at this point," Anthony Cervone, a G.M. spokesman, said.
The Fuji deal may not be the last for G.M., or for other automakers looking for more business in Asia. With the recovering Japanese economy helping regional economies rebound across Asia, Detroit's carmakers are busy trying to forge links through investments and other alliances.
On Tuesday, a Ford Motor executive traveled to South Korea to meet with bankers there. G.M. has spent 22 months negotiating with Daewoo, the country's No. 2 automaker, over whether to take a stake in the company, which is in financial difficulty. But the bankers asked Ford whether it was interested in Daewoo.
Ford told the bankers "we are always interested in subjects under the right conditions," W. Wayne Booker, a Ford vice chairman, said in an interview tonight. He cautioned that Ford had yet to hold talks with Daewoo. "We haven't made any proposals to anybody," Mr. Booker said.
Like G.M., Ford has looked to alliances with other automakers to try to increase its market share in the Asia-Pacific region. Ford will not disclose its country-by-country 10-year goals, but G.M. has said it wants to increase its market share in the region to 10 percent by 2005.
G.M. has not broken off its talks with Daewoo. Ford's interest could force a decision on the matter soon if it does not derail the G.M. talks. G.M. signed a memorandum of understanding with Daewoo in February 1998 that laid the groundwork for discussions about a deal, with a second memorandum of understanding signed in August.
G.M.'s long discussions with Daewoo have run aground because G.M. wants to avoid acquiring any of Daewoo's enormous debt burden.
Nissan also owns a 4 percent stake in Fuji, and is negotiating whether to sell that stake to G.M., people close to the deal said.
The G.M. deal to buy a fifth of Fuji would be just the latest in a wave of cross-border alliances in the auto industry. Last year, Daimler-Benz of Germany bought the Chrysler Corporation, the smallest of Detroit's Big Three. Earlier this year, Ford bought Volvo of Sweden.
G.M. itself last year raised its stakes in Isuzu Motors Ltd. and the Suzuki Motor Corporation to 49 percent and 10 percent, respectively. In the coming months, G.M. may also buy the piece of Saab it does not already own.

HEADLINE: New Coca-Cola Chief Says He Plans No Abrupt Change

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
Three days after his surprising selection as the next chairman and chief executive of Coca-Cola, Douglas N. Daft got on the telephone with reporters yesterday and talked about, among other things, his feelings upon being asked to take the lead.
"They've tended to range from shock to surprise to sorrow to elation," Mr. Daft said. And then there is pride, he added, "pride in the company and pride in being asked to take this position." 
 The overtures to reporters and the discussion of his emotional life are two signs of the difference between Mr. Daft's style and that of his predecessor, M. Douglas Ivester, who stunned the business world by announcing on Monday that he would step down.
But it seems that Coca-Cola will not operate so differently under Mr. Daft. His mentors, he said, were Roberto C. Goizueta, the chairman and chief executive who died in 1997, Mr. Ivester and Donald R. Keough, the former president who now works for Allen & Company, the investment bank. He stands by the large price increases Coke recently instituted for the concentrate it sells to bottlers in the United States, even though many of them are irked. And he said he was committed to increasing the number of cases sold by 7 percent to 8 percent and earnings growth by 15 percent to 20 percent, even though many on Wall Street doubt the company can pull off.
The company whose corner office he will inhabit is tarnished from a year of regulatory difficulties, a racial discrimination lawsuit filed by four current and former employees and the biggest product recall in its history. The share price has fallen 7 percent this year, and earnings have disappointed for the last six quarters. Coca-Cola earns 75 percent of its profits overseas; many of those markets have been gripped by recession or monetary crises for years.
"We have said we are in a period of readjustment," Mr. Daft said. "The October and November results were ahead of the third quarter; 2000 is the year of the recovery for the world, and obviously our business will be part of that."
Some analysts question whether Coca-Cola can grow at twice the industry average. "We've advised investors to wait out this period of uncertainty, and we're waiting to get comfortable that Doug Daft is not just going to keep the status quo," said Bill Pecoriello, a beverage analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein.
The issues facing Coca-Cola, he said, include devising a way to make the global bottler system profitable after a long period of consolidation, as well as how to successfully sell Coke in regions like Latin America, Eastern Europe and parts of Asia where cheaper brands have chipped away at Coca-Cola's market share. And Coca-Cola might be better off lowering expectations, which would affect share price in the short term but redefine what growth means at the company.
Mr. Ivester was known as a brilliant tactician who preached an aggressive growth plan and once made a speech before an industry group in which he compared Coca-Cola to a wolf among sheep and declared he wanted the entire soft drink market, not just a share of it. Part of his strategy included urging bottlers to consolidate and exhorting "anchor bottlers," the biggest, to invest heavily in vending machines, production plants and other equipment.
In many parts of the world, Coke's big bottlers have poor returns on their invested capital because local fiscal crises have cut demand for relatively expensive American soft drinks. The bottlers in trouble include Coca-Cola Beverages, based in London and operating in Eastern Europe and Italy; Coca-Cola Amatil, based in Sydney, Australia, and operating in much of East Asia, and Pan American Beverages, known as Panamco, which paid close to $1 billion for a bottling company in Venezuela, soon before a major economic downturn there.
"They have to make the bottler network sustainable," Mr. Pecoriello said. "It can't be the Coca-Cola Company winning at the expense of its bottlers."
Asked whether he needed to mend fences with bottlers, whose displeasure at the concentrate-price increases -- at 7 percent, twice the typical rate -- probably did not go unnoticed by Coca-Cola's board, Mr. Daft said he thought the situation had been overstated.
"We have extremely strong relationships with all our partners everywhere," he said. As for the price increases, he added: "I was well aware of the strategy in the U.S. and well aware of the thinking behind it. And I totally agree with it."
Coca-Cola has been in the business of making huge support payments to its bottlers. Its largest bottler, Coca-Cola Enterprises in Atlanta, received just less than $1 billion last year, without which the publicly traded bottler would have finished the year in the red.
Market support to bottlers will continue, Mr. Daft said, although he did not give specifics. "The market support is a critical part of the relationship," he said. "Each of the bottlers will continue to get that support, and the level will depend on the local market and local needs."
Mr. Daft told of meeting with Mr. Ivester last Friday night, in what he thought was just a routine conversation with his boss. "He called me into his office and said to me, 'Remember when we talked about making life decisions?' " Mr. Daft said, adding that he had made one of his own some six months earlier. "And then he told me, 'I've just made one.' And he told me what it was."
What followed was "sorrow and discussion," he added. "And on Sunday, he said to me, 'Whatever happens, I'm your friend.' Both of us were very emotional."

HEADLINE: Democrats Asserting Campaign Violation

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 9

 BODY:
House Democrats have complained to the Federal Election Commission that the National Republican Congressional Committee is violating federal election law by giving money to three nonprofit groups linked to Representative Tom DeLay.
In the complaint, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee called for an immediate investigation, saying that the groups "are established, financed, maintained, and controlled by the very same individuals who run the N.R.C.C." 
 The complaint was filed after the newspaper Roll Call reported this week that the Republican committee had given $500,000 to a group, the US Family Network, that had ties to Mr. DeLay, the Republican whip.
The other groups named in the complaint are Americans for Economic Growth and the Republican Majority Issues Conference.
Don Matoon, deputy chairman of the Republican committee, called the assertions "utterly baseless."

HEADLINE: As U.N. Nears Action on Iraq, Inspections Remain Unsettled

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 9

 BODY:
Two Security Council resolutions that pave the way toward a new relationship between the United Nations and Iraq are headed for a decision this week, diplomats said today.
Sir Jeremy Greenstock, the British representative, said, "We are now on the run to a final vote." 
 A proposal to extend the oil-for-food program is expected to pass on Friday without much debate. Under that program, the Iraqis are allowed to sell $5.26 billion worth of oil every six months to pay for urgent civilian needs. That vote is expected to lead the Iraqis to resume oil exports, which they suspended three weeks ago to protest stopgap extensions.
More difficult will be the adoption of a plan creating a new arms inspection system for Iraq, which could lead to a suspension of the crippling embargo on Saddam Hussein's government next year. The embargo was imposed after President Hussein's invasion of Kuwait in 1990. This vote is tentatively planned for Saturday, but governments are still discussing key provisions.
After the Persian Gulf war ended in 1991, the sanctions were linked to Iraqi promises to destroy all prohibited weapons. The sanctions have remained in place because inspectors could not certify that Iraq was free of biological, chemical and nuclear weapons and certain missile systems, or was not trying to re-create them from hidden material or illegal imports.
At issue now between the United States and Russia is how and when to determine that Iraq is in compliance.
The current draft of the resolution gives the new United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission and its executive chairman, to be appointed by the secretary general, the responsibility for setting the tasks Iraq must accomplish and for judging progress.
The United States, Britain and a majority of other council members interpret that as demanding a high level of compliance with both the new commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency, which will be responsible for watching Iraq's nuclear programs.
Russia prefers a demonstration of cooperation with inspectors as a new system is installed in Iraq, but not a requirement to meet all disarmament tasks before sanctions could be suspended.
Russia also wants a suspension of sanctions -- to be reviewed every 120 days under the newest draft -- to take place by the end of next year, a fixed date. The United States says sanctions should be suspended only after Iraq has met the tasks assigned by the new inspection team.
Thomas R. Pickering, the American undersecretary of state, was in New York again today for talks with the Russian envoy, Sergey Lavrov, but diplomats would not say what they discussed.

HEADLINE: Transportation Board Hurt by 'Serious Overload,' Study Finds

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 9

 BODY:
The National Transportation Safety Board is facing increasing doubt, from inside its ranks and from outside aviation experts, about its ability to investigate complex airline accidents as it tries to re-structure itself and cope with a variety of high-stakes investigations.
According to a report released today by the Rand Corporation, requested by the safety board officials last year, the board is "coping with serious overload." Rand researchers reported having "encountered a consistent uneasiness regarding the ability of the N.T.S.B. to generate timely, accurate results." 
 Among the staff and board members, aviation veterans are raising questions about the quality of the board's work.
Two principal authors of the $400,000 study declined to identify specific cases. But within the five-member board and among its staff, there is dissatisfaction, for example, with the investigation into a fire on board a Federal Express DC-10 flying from Boston to Memphis in September 1996. The plane made an emergency landing in Newburgh, N.Y., and the five crew members barely escaped.
The safety board found evidence that a biomedical device on board had been improperly carrying a flammable fluid, and some investigators thought that had been the cause of the fire. But the board decided there was insufficient evidence to isolate that device as the probable cause of the accident, which destroyed a $30 million aircraft, partly because the staff could not say how much of the liquid was present before the fire.
"We didn't nail the facts down," said one board member, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The report said the time needed to complete major investigations was "climbing alarmingly." The September 1994, crash of a Boeing 737 operated by USAir near Pittsburgh, which killed all 132 people on board, took more than four years to study. The explosion of T.W.A. Flight 800 off Long Island in July, 1996, is still under investigation.
The report comes as the board is restructures itself, struggling over who should release information on accidents -- and when -- and over its public image.
In October, without meeting, the board quietly approved a new order on press relations that bars a board member from staying at the scene of a crash for more than five days without the permission of the board chairman. Board members say the vote was a reaction to the T.W.A. 800 crash, in which Robert T. Francis, the vice chairman, stayed on Long Island for weeks, appearing at joint briefings with the F.B.I. and the Navy.
The chairman, James E. Hall, has also broken the regular pattern of sending board members to accidents according to a rotation system; for the crash of John F. Kennedy Jr.'s plane and the EgyptAir 990 crash, he went himself, although it was not his turn to go.
In addition, Mr. Hall has instituted stricter controls on travel, following inquiries about travel expenses by members of Congress.
The various changes have produced some resentment within the board.
The board is also struggling with the flow of information. Longtime board officials say they are stunned at the growing intensity of interest by news organizations after prominent crashes.

Amazon LeadsNasdaq to Record on Extremely Busy Day

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The Nasdaq Composite Index rose to a record yesterday in the busiest day ever on the Nasdaq stock market, led by Amazon.com Inc., which benefited from optimism about holiday sales.
"Amazon.com is having an amazing day," said Tim Ghriskey, who helps to oversee about $120 billion at the Dreyfus Corporation. "We have been saying all along that it will be a good seasonal shopping season and that the e-commmerce segment of the consumer dollar would skyrocket." 
 The Nasdaq index rose 8.09 points, to 3,594.17, as Amazon.com jumped 14 3/4, to 103 1/4. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 4.23, to 1,408.11.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 66.67, to 11,134.79, with Home Depot Inc. and Wal-Mart Stores accounting for more than half of the gain.
Still, three stocks fell for every two that rose on the New York Stock Exchange.
Shares of VA Linux Systems Inc., which had its initial public offering at 30 yesterday, rocketed to 242 3/8, touching a high of 320 in Nasdaq trading. The company, which is offering software and computers for the free Linux operating system, had the best first day of any public offering ever.
Amazon.com gained after an analyst at J. P. Morgan Securities, Thomas Wyman, said sales could more than double, to $569.2 million, in the fourth quarter and rise 68 percent, to $2.6 billion, next year. He initiated coverage yesterday with a "buy" rating and said the stock could reach $160 in a year.
The Nasdaq stock market reported its busiest day ever, with 1.76 billion shares changing hands. The New York Stock Exchange reported its eighth-biggest day ever, with 1.11 billion shares traded.
"There really is no weakness in the market; there is volatility," said Michael Lyons, listed equity trader at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Company. "Investors run stocks up and then run them down."
I.B.M., the world's largest computer company, fell 4 11/16, to 113 11/16, after it repeated a forecast that its earnings in the fourth and first quarters would be lower because of Year 2000 concerns among its customers.
The warning, given during a closed meeting with analysts, is similar to one the company made on Oct. 20, when it said earnings would be crimped as customers delayed purchases of mainframe computers as they address Year 2000 issues. Yesterday's statements eased concerns that the company would forecast bigger declines, according to analysts who attended the meeting.
Home Depot rose 3 3/4, to 87 1/4, after the company, the No. 1 home-improvement retailer, said it would begin selling large appliances like refrigerators and dishwashers at most United States stores next year.

Moderate Treasury Gain
 By Reuters
United States Treasury bonds eked out modest gains in thin trading yesterday, as investors once again favored corporate debt over government bonds.
The dominant debt sale was a $3 billion offering of 10-year notes from Freddie Mac, a company chartered by Congress that purchases home mortgage loans from lenders and packages them into securities for investors. Freddie Mac's issue yields 63 basis points over the United States' 10-year note.
Still, the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond's price was higher for the day at 98 26/32, up 5/32, to yield 6.21 percent, which was down from 6.22 percent on Wednesday. It was the fourth time in five sessions that bond prices had risen.

HEADLINE: An Eagerness for Peace

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SONTAG 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Dec. 9

 BODY:
In the Middle East, negotiations come and negotiations go and everyone has learned to be guarded, even jaded, about the possibilities for agreements, much less real peace.
But a feeling that change was imminent swept through Israel today after President Clinton's surprise announcement that Israeli-Syrian talks would resume next week after being suspended for nearly four years. The national pulse seemed to quicken -- for some with elation, for others with anxiety. Even the right wing, so quiet these last few months, girded for its first real combat. 
 Why did they all get ahead of themselves? Supporters and opponents alike talked as if the resumption of talks, which are bound to be difficult and crisis-ridden, was tantamount to an agreement. Many were already asking whether voters would approve an accord in a referendum and whether Syria would get American financing to modernize its Soviet-equipped army.
Perhaps it was because there is a deep-seated sense that the stars are aligned for a deal. All three leaders -- President Clinton, President Hafez al-Assad of Syria and Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel -- are hungry for a success, determined to prove that they can resolve this 32-year-old conflict once and for all.
"I think what we have this time is not artificial deadlines but real ones," said Stephen P. Cohen, the senior policy adviser of the Center for Middle East Peace in New York. "There is the deadline of biology and the deadline of the decline of political power, or its potential, for the three principals."
For Mr. Assad, the recent deaths of two important Arab leaders of his generation -- King Hussein of Jordan and King Hassan of Morocco -- have been reminders of the physical limits of power. Mr. Assad, 69, is believed to be in ill health, plagued by chronic and debilitating disorders that include diabetes and possibly some form of cancer.
To retrieve the Golan Heights, the strategic plateau he lost to Israel in the 1967 war, would close a circle and provide neat borders to his rule.
Also, experts on Syria believe Mr. Assad wants to ensure that the reins of power will be smoothly handed to his son Bashar, 34, and that to accomplish this he needs to consolidate his own position.
By taking on peace with Israel, Mr. Assad seeks to prove that he is willing to finish something he started eight years ago at a conference in Madrid. To walk away from the table this time, without the Golan Heights, would be seen as a defeat and would undercut his authority at a critical time. Like the Israelis, after so much talk the Syrians are impatient to see results.
And from a Syrian point of view, Mr. Barak is an attractive negotiating partner; he grounds his concept of peace in a view of Israeli national security and does not stress economic normalization, an idea that reportedly frightens Mr. Assad.
That the Syrians are willing to send their foreign minister, Farouk al-Shara, to meet with Mr. Barak increases both the public risk they are taking and the prospects of success.
"What was lacking until now was the political will on both sides to come to closure," said Itamar Rabinovich, president of Tel Aviv University, who previously led Israel's negotiations with Syria. "A lot of the basic work has already been done. There is a legacy to the negotiations."
Both the Syrians and the Israelis realize that they can only be guaranteed Washington's focused support in the immediate future, before the American presidential campaign moves into full drive.
President Clinton clearly wants to secure a major accomplishment in a region where he has invested so much energy, and time is running out.
Mr. Barak feels time to be of the essence, too. He is a great believer in momentum, which is why he set a peace deadline for himself shortly after taking office in July. In 15 months, more or less, he said, he would achieve peace with the Palestinians and peace with the Syrians and withdraw Israeli troops from southern Lebanon. His targets set the agenda for the region, pressing the other leaders to move quickly.
But Mr. Barak faced political fall-out at home, too, when his peacemaking did not take off as quickly as he had planned. He was encountering his first real disenchantment at home as anxieties rose that he would not be able to live up to his diplomatic ambitions. But with the announcement that talks would resume, his political profile changed almost overnight.
"Up until last night, Ehud Barak was a prime minister under siege," Yossi Verter wrote today in the daily Haaretz. "But last night was a long time ago, before Hafez al-Assad enlisted to help him. The sudden breakthrough in negotiations with Syria restored the color to Barak's wan cheeks."
The first handshake between high-level Israeli and Syrian officials is bound to produce a ripple throughout the Middle East, a sense that the defining tensions are starting to shift.
Mr. Barak declared today that everything can be sewn up quickly, within a few months. His certainty set the tone, and encouraged Israelis to leap far forward in their thinking. With remarkable precision, Channel 2 television tonight predicted a 58 to 41 Parliament approval of any eventual agreement.
But the detailed negotiations that follow are bound to be tortuous. They will take place in the Mideast, possibly in Amman, Jordan.
In concept, the Israelis and the Syrians would seem to be close at the outset. Like other leaders before him, Mr. Barak is prepared to concede the Golan Heights in exchange for security guarantees and greater normalization of relations. But the border lines are key.
The Israelis will propose withdrawing to borders agreed to internationally in 1923. The Syrians have insisted on the borders of June 4, 1967, before the Golan Heights were occupied by Israel, which would give Syria access to the Sea of Galilee.
"The difference is a few miles, and for Americans, with their expansive continent, it seems pathetic," Mr. Rabinovich said. "But this is the proverbial olive tree. For the Syrians, to be or not to be on the water's edge is critical."
The Israelis are likely to urge the Syrian leaders to engage in a kind of public diplomacy they may not be prepared to undertake. That would mean sending clear messages to their people that Israel is no longer the enemy, and making sure that Israel's northern border is free of violence as Israeli troops began to withdraw.
The Israeli-Egyptian peace deal, born at Camp David 20 years ago with a framework agreement between Prime Minister Menachem Begin and President Anwar Sadat, will shadow the talks. The Syrians will push to extend beyond the international borders just as the Egyptians pushed to get Taba in addition to the Sinai. If the Israelis insist on maintaining a presence at an early warning station on Mount Hermon, the Syrians are likely to point out that Israel withdrew completely from the Sinai.
"Assad cannot do a worse deal than Sadat," said Dore Gold, Israel's former ambassador to the United Nations. "He has to try to do a better deal. Otherwise his people will say, 'Why did you wait 20 years?' "

The Book on George W.

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS 

 BODY:
During his first presidential debate, George W. Bush volunteered that he was reading a book about postwar international policy. It is possibly a bad sign that we now feel compelled to examine what he meant by "read."
Our leading Republican candidate has been plagued by speculation that he's not all that deep a thinker. "I read books all the time," he told the debate audience in New Hampshire, a tad defensively. "I'm reading a book on Dean Acheson right now." 
 Aides said the book in question was "Acheson: The Secretary of State Who Created the American World," by James Chace. Weighing in at 512 pages, it describes Acheson's work overseeing the establishment of NATO and the World Bank, and the financing of the Marshall plan.
How many people out there think that Mr. Bush:
A) really read the book.
B) really read some of the book.
C) was really briefed by an adviser who is reading the book.
D) purchased the book and was carrying it around in his suitcase at the time of the debate.
We don't want to be hyper-critical. Many of us believe that, for the purposes of dinner party conversation, paying for a book and hauling it from one hotel room to the next counts as reading it. Now that I have skimmed two reviews of "Acheson" and talked to the author on the phone for 10 minutes, I feel qualified to assure you it is one really fine piece of work, and to discuss it at social events with great authority.
However, the bar gets raised a bit when a presidential candidate goes on TV and claims to have an impressive-sounding tome on his night table in order to demonstrate he's not a superficial, underprepared, overentitled Quayle clone. I think I speak for all of us in saying that under those circumstances, the alleged reader should at least prepare a few pithy comments demonstrating that he knows what the book is about.
A few days and another debate later, Mr. Bush was asked, rather cruelly, what lessons he had learned from his study of the Acheson era. The flummoxed governor started out with a caution that the United States should not "retreat within our borders." He put in a good word for free trade, quoted a speech he gave at the Citadel, and concluded this way:
"The lessons of Acheson and Marshall are -- is that our nation's greatest export to the world has been, is, and always will be the incredible freedoms we understand in the great land called America."
Later, Mr. Bush said it was hard to give a full book review "in a minute's time," but more time was the last thing he appeared to need. In fact, he looked like a ninth grader had who forgotten to do his homework, desperately free-associating and hoping the bell would ring.
If Mr. Bush was telling the truth about the Acheson book, he is apparently capable of reading 512 pages of material and coming away from the exercise without a single new thought. Even if he's only made his way through the first few chapters, he should have been able to answer the debate question by saying he had learned that a man can become a successful public servant after being a C student at Yale.
If he was fibbing, the problem is even worse. An American president meets dozens of heads of state every year, virtually all of whom have written books, most of them unreadable. How would President Bush, the Sequel, react when one of them fishes for a compliment about a recent literary effort? We don't necessarily need a great reader in the White House, but we do need somebody who knows how to fake it under pressure.
Mr. Bush never tried to pass himself off as an intellectual before. When you've got charisma, who needs a Phi Beta Kappa key? But the shock of the early debates has been how charmless he's appeared. If Dan Quayle looked like a deer caught in the headlights when he was in front of the cameras, Mr. Bush sometimes resembles a possum cornered in the garage -- hunched over, tense, eyes darting worriedly.
Perhaps in response, his campaign has been trying to upgrade his image as a thinker. By recent accounts of the Bush team, over the last few weeks he's devoured approximately 2,000 pages of nonfiction, including a 774-page biography of John D. Rockefeller and a 476-page work on Chinese-American relations.
Big books. Deep man.

HEADLINE: A Tiny Company Without Profits Goes Public With a Bang

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 9

 BODY:
Internet mania reached new levels of frenzy today as investors paid huge multiples on an initial public offering, giving a market value of almost $10 billion to a tiny company with powerful competitors, little revenue and no expectation of earnings in the foreseeable future.
The company, VA Linux Systems of Sunnyvale, Calif., sells computers powered by standard Intel Pentium processors that run on Linux, the free Unix-based operating system created by a Finnish graduate student and now marketed by more than a dozen companies worldwide. The computers are designed as servers, computers that deliver Internet products, like Web pages and e-mail, or other network services. 
 Though giants like Dell Computer and I.B.M. already market Linux servers of similar power, shares of VA Linux Systems surged more than eightfold today, setting a record for an initial public offering.
The company sold 4.4 million shares, an 11 percent stake, priced at $30 a share, raising $132 million. The shares opened at $300, and closed at $242.375 in Nasdaq trading.
The appetite for shares of companies that deal in Linux products and services has been enormous this year, and those stocks shared in today's largess. Shares in Red Hat, a Linux distributor, have soared twentyfold since the company went public Aug. 11 and rose $16.50, to $287, today. Andover.Net, which runs a network of Web sites devoted to Linux, has more than quadrupled since its initial offering on Wednesday, gaining $14.8125, to close at $78.8125. The Corel Corporation, which sells software that runs on the Linux system, most notably a Linux version of its WordPerfect document-creation software, rose $11.25, to $39.375, after trading as low as $2 in the last year.
VA Linux has never made money and does not expect to for some time. As the company's prospectus points out: "We do not expect to generate sufficient revenues to achieve profitability and, therefore, we expect to continue to incur net losses for at least the foreseeable future. If we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain it."
No problem, the stampeding market said.
"A stock like this is an obvious example of something going through the roof with absolutely no underlying fundamentals," said Michael C. Perkins, co-author of "The Internet Bubble" (Harper Business, 1999). "It starts with the institutions flipping the stock, and then the momentum players and the day traders take over. Just when you think you've seen the peak of the insanity, this is a perfect bubble stock."
Linux, created by Linus Torvalds in 1991, has become a cause celebre within an industry wary of Microsoft's domination of both operating systems, with Windows, and the business application programs that run on it.
It is also the darling of "open source" advocates. Open source is based on the concept that making a program's underlying code freely available, and allowing it to be modified by anyone, will result in a more powerful and secure system and will free consumers from the tyranny of proprietary operating systems, especially Windows. Linux grew out of the GNU Project, an effort to build a free operating system similar to Unix.
Although the Linux kernel and associated GNU (pronounced guh-NEW) components can be downloaded free by anybody, more than 22 companies now sell GNU/Linux software. The best known are Red Hat, Suse, Turbo Linux, Caldera Systems and Mandrake Soft.
As the notion that Linux could be a viable alternative to Windows has gained currency, these companies have captured the imagination of investors.
In part, that notion was fed by Microsoft itself, which insisted earlier this year in its antitrust battle with the government that Linux threatened its Windows monopoly.
"People who were not there for the great I.P.O. of the 80's see this as an opportunity to ride the crest again, as Microsoft II," said Maureen O'Gara, publisher of Client Server News, a trade publication. "This is not based on fundamentals. They don't read beyond the first page of the prospectus."
In the case of VA Linux, she said, "The fact that they could be crushed by one finger of Dell's hand has not slowed their flight."
Shipments of Linux-based computers are expected to grow by 25 percent from 1999 through 2003, more than twice the 10 percent to 12 percent pace for other workstation and server systems, according to the International Data Corporation, a market research firm based in Framingham, Mass.
But that kind of increase is possible only because the market today is so minuscule. Lost in the excitement about Linux is the fact that the actual user base today is tiny compared with Windows, commercial versions of the Unix operating system or Apple Computer's Mac OS. Although Linux proponents often say that the operating system is more reliable and secure than Windows NT, major corporations have not been eager to run mission-critical applications on Linux. Those that have embraced Unix are more likely to buy Solaris from Sun Microsystems, HP/UX from Hewlett-Packard or other name brands.
VA Linux's biggest sales have been to Internet companies, including Akamai Technologies, eToys, StarMedia Network and 24/7 Media. Sales to these four customers accounted for 14.5 percent of the company's total revenue of $17.7 million in fiscal 1999 and 23.3 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2000.
"People say Linux is going to kill Microsoft, but I say, 'How do you do that without killing Sun first?' " said Michael Murphy, editor of the California Technology Stock Letter. "I don't think they have any understanding of what Linux is, what it means, the fact that it's free."
Nevertheless, VA Linux was represented by leading investment banks, and had previously attracted knowledgeable venture investors. Credit Suisse First Boston was the lead underwriter, with Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown, Hambrecht & Quist and Lehman Brothers as the co-managers of the offering. The company's backers include the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Sequoia Capital, which holds a 23 percent stake, and Intel, which holds an 8.9 percent stake.

14th St. Revival Is Picking Up Pace With Union Square Project

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
Except for their street-level stores, the three buildings along 14th Street in Manhattan's Union Square neighborhood have remained mostly empty for decades. Now, a development group is turning those floors into rental apartments as part of the area's continued revival, which includes a number of other residential projects, dormitories for more than 2,000 New York University students and plans for a hotel.
The group, 1314 Development of Manhattan, is investing $15.5 million to create 59 apartments, mostly studios and one-bedroom units, in the six- to nine-story buildings. Two of the buildings, which will have 22 and 5 apartments respectively, are at 18 and 20 East 14th Street, between Fifth Avenue and University Place. The third building, which will have 32 apartments, is a former department store a block and a half away at 58-60 West 14th Street, between Fifth Avenue and the Avenue of the Americas. 
 The apartments in the three buildings, two of which have elevators, will range in size from about 500 to 855 square feet. Penthouses will have one to three bedrooms and up to 900 square feet, and there is one 1,300-square-foot loft apartment. Many of the apartments have high ceilings and offer either home offices, greenhouses or terraces.
Monthly rents for the apartments are to range from $1,750 for the smallest studio in the walkup building to $3,900 for a one-bedroom unit with a home office in the former department store. The penthouses as well as the loft residence, all at 18 East 14th Street, are to rent for $4,000 to $5,000 a month,
The development group is also creating a landscaped entrance with benches on 13th Street for 18 East 14th to give it a more residential address, 17 East 13th Street, and adding two new floors to the six-story building for one of the penthouses. It also is shaving space from the rear of the West 14th Street building to provide more light and air to those apartments and using that cutaway space to add to the top of the five-story building as four new floors.
The renovation of all three buildings is to be completed by February, said Charles Blaichman, a principal of 1314 Development. The partners bought the three 14th Street buildings in June 1998 from the Pravda family, which had owned them for decades and had mainly rented out the 10,000 square feet of retail space. Three existing residential tenants in the East 14th Street buildings will remain in their apartments, which are being renovated, at below-market rents.
Mr. Blaichman said he and the partners got involved with the project because "for years, 14th Street was seen as a demilitarized zone and overlooked for development, but the area is changing." Another factor, he said, is that the area is accessible to mass transportation and borders more established residential neighborhoods like Chelsea and the Village.
While Union Square's transformation began in the last decade's building boom, it was cut short by the 1991-92 recession. The activity resumed in 1995 and has gained momentum in the last year and a half. According to the 14th Street-Union Square Business Improvement District, more than one million square feet of commercial and residential development has been recently completed or is under way along 14th Street from Third to Eighth Avenues.
Many consider the opening 18 months ago of 1 Union Square South, a 240-unit rental complex, as bolstering the area's appeal as a residential address. It is being joined by other projects, including the conversion of the former Siegel-Cooper department store on the Avenue of the Americas blockfront from 13th to 14th Street into 79 luxury loft condos.
Between Seventh Avenue and the Avenue of the Americas, the 14th Street Armory is soon to be bulldozed to make way for a retail and housing complex. Plans for its residential component to consist of 40 condominiums and 140 rental assisted-living apartments for the elderly have been changed, with the plans now calling for 200 market-rate rentals and 50 condos. The change was made when the Related Companies, which also built 1 Union Square South, replaced the developer of the housing for the elderly as part of the development team building the complex.
New York University is under contract to buy the condominium units for housing for its faculty members. The purchase underscores N.Y.U.'s expanding presence in the area in recent years. It has built or is building two dormitories, at 110 and 126-138 East 14th Street, between Third and Fourth Avenues and recently signed a 10-year lease to rent the 14-story building rising on the site of the former Sahara Hotel at the corner of 14th Street and Third Avenue.
The influx of new residents and students, as well as office tenants, many in the new media industry, is also bringing in other types of development. An example is the plan to convert the former Guardian Life Insurance Building, at 50 Union Square, into a 250-room hotel, a first for the neighborhood, said David Gmach, executive director of the business improvement district.
Mr. Blaichman said that because the three buildings he was renovating were long and narrow, he was creating mainly studio and one-bedroom rentals with "interesting rather than cookie-cutter layouts," for which he said he believed there would be a market among young professional singles and couples. The Architects Design Group is the architect for all three buildings.
Typical monthly rents for renovated rentals in a nondoorman building in the immediate area are $1,895 for a 500-square-foot studio and $2,495 for a 700-square-foot one-bedroom unit, according to Benjamin James Associates, a rental brokerage.
Marketing began last month for the 22 apartments at 18 East 14th Street, said Natalie S. Rakowski of Douglas Elliman, the leasing agent for Mr. Blaichman's buildings, and so far, contracts have been signed for all but three of them. Leasing for the apartments in the neighboring building is to start next week and by mid-February for those at the West 14th Street building, she said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Told to Spend More to Neutralize Soviet Germ Scientists

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER 

 BODY:
The Clinton administration has made "impressive strides" in preventing former Soviet scientists from working for rogue states and terrorists seeking unconventional weapons, but it should spend much more to achieve that aim, a Washington research group said yesterday.
"Given the consequences of the chemical and biological brain drain," says a report issued by the Henry L. Stimson Center in Washington, "sound argument can be made for at least doubling the amount of money going annually into collaborative research grants for biological weaponeers, and at a minimum tripling the grant funds for chemical weapons scientists." 
 The Pentagon alone has allocated $3.172 billion since 1992 to help the former Soviet states secure and dismantle their weapons of mass destruction and keep their scientists peacefully employed. But Amy E. Smithson, a chemical and germ warfare expert who wrote the report, argues that much of this money has been skewed toward the nuclear sector and too little of it toward keeping germ and chemical scientists gainfully employed.
Since 1994, the administration has invested about $250 million in the four programs aimed at engaging former Soviet weapons scientists in collaborative research. Of that amount, Dr. Smithson says, only $7.5 million has gone toward supporting chemists, and only $19.5 million for support of former biological weapons scientists.
As a result, she writes, the major American grant program got money in 1998 to only 1,000 of the 7,000 biological scientists with expertise in deadly germs. And of those who received grants and stipends, the average support was "inadequate to keep 10,500 key chemical and biological weapons experts above the poverty line."
Noting that the cost of a six-year effort to vaccinate American forces against anthrax, a Soviet germ weapon, is $130 million, the report says "it is more cost-effective to stop proliferation at the source."
Dr. Smithson says the exhaustive review process of prospective grants results in substantial delays in getting money to scientists in desperate need.
"Scientists who need to feed their families will find it difficult to withstand the prosperity that proliferators offer if the proposal approval process drags on for more than two years," notes the report, which is scheduled to be published today. Moreover, the four different pots of money to contain the problem "invite complication" and competition among the agencies.
The report also criticizes the Russian government for keeping "hold-over apparatchiks" intent on blocking scientific cooperation in positions of power.
Pressure from such hard-line elements has kept four key biological labs run by the military and a network of anti-plague institutes closed to outside scrutiny, the report says. In turn, that fosters suspicion about whether Russia is still conducting illegal germ and chemical weapons research and development.
"Unlike these cold warriors, the overwhelming majority of the scientists want out of the weapons business," she concludes, based on visits to former Soviet unconventional weapons institutes and interviews with administration officials.
Dr. Smithson, whose views particularly on chemical weapons are well respected by conservative and liberal defense analysts in Washington, disagrees with those who argue that cutting money for Russian science will force Moscow to open its military institutes and become more open about its past weapons programs.
Offering incentives, she says, is more likely to entice military scientists who are trying to find their way in Russia's turbulent economy and half-hearted political reform.
On balance, she gives high marks to the concept of stopping the spread of dangerous nuclear, chemical and biological expertise by engaging the very scientists who built the unconventional weapons that were once aimed at America.
"In order to milk a rattlesnake," she writes, quoting an American official involved in the programs, "one has to grab it by the head."

HEADLINE: Mandela Visits the Northwest and Talks Philanthropy With Gates

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Dec. 9

 BODY:
Nelson Mandela, the former president of South Africa, had breakfast this morning at the Lake Washington estate of the chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, William H. Gates. "I told Bill and Melinda that I haven't got a word in English to describe my impression of the house," Mr. Mandela recounted afterward. "I don't think 'beautiful,' or 'exquisite,' is enough."
Elsewhere during the three-day visit here that began on Wednesday, Mr. Mandela took the baton and led the Seattle Symphony and a high-school choir in a rendition of the South African national anthem. He smiled graciously at a public school when questions from students were read aloud, and one wanted to know what he had done with his "spare time" during 27 years in prison. 
 Among the subjects that Mr. Gates and Mr. Mandela discussed was a $750 million fund that Mr. Gates is setting up to help vaccinate children in developing countries against deadly diseases. They also discussed a newly formed foundation established by Mr. Mandela to promote health care and education across the African continent.
The Nobel Peace laureate sought Mr. Gates's support for his new foundation. He also implored business leaders here and across the country to get involved in a crusade to develop vaccines, including one against the AIDS virus, and distribute them to rich and poor alike around the world.
"Children across Africa die every day because they don't have access to vaccines that children in communities like Seattle take for granted," the 81-year-old former president and anti-apartheid leader said today at a global health forum at the University of Washington here.
That Mr. Mandela and his wife, Graca Machel, would choose to make a relatively extended trip to Seattle is a powerful demonstration of the growing role of philanthropies based here in the Pacific Northwest. Seattle is home to three of the world's richest men (Mr. Gates, the Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, and Microsoft's president, Steve Ballmer), and the foundation established by Mr. Gates and his wife recently became the biggest philanthropic organization in the world.
The Craig and Susan McCaw Foundation, also based here, helped to sponsor the trip.
Seattle was to be the only stop on his trip to this country, but the White House said today that Mr. Mandela was likely to stop off briefly in Florida on Saturday on his way home to meet with President Clinton, who will be speaking to the state Democratic convention there. The two plan to discuss Middle East peace talks.
Mr. Mandela's visit here has clearly given a needed lift to a city still reeling from the aftermath of the protests that engulfed the streets during last week's meeting here of the World Trade Organization.
During a brief interview this morning, Mr. Mandela and Mr. Gates were all smiles.
Mr. Mandela spoke repeatedly of the need to develop a vaccine against AIDS.
After Mr. Gates spoke with some passion about his desire to develop vaccines for a whole host of diseases, Mr. Mandela rose and mockingly chided him for "a very important omission" in his list.
"There needs to be a vaccine against old age," the elder statesman deadpanned, as his audience broke into laughter and cheers. "I hope that Bill will go to work to develop that vaccine."

HEADLINE: For Caseworker, Helping Is a Frustrating Struggle

SERIES: LIFE AFTER WELFARE: The Caseworker

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE 

DATELINE: MILWAUKEE

 BODY:
Many people consider themselves experts on this city's war on welfare, but few have ridden its highs and lows as intensely as Michael Steinborn.
Shortly after he became a caseworker last year, he ran four blocks through the snow to buy a coat for a freezing client. She sold it to buy crack. He worked past 1 a.m. to polish another client's resume. She skipped her job interview. He listened to one woman reject a work assignment with an indignant explanation: "I don't do mornings." He listened to another explain how she had coped with the loss of her welfare check -- by selling her body to an old man for $50 a day. 
 Then again, once in a while, he sees something that really surprises him: Clients he thought would never work have gone out and gotten jobs. "All the sudden, the little light in their head goes on," he said. "It almost makes it worthwhile, at least for that day."
Eighteen months ago, Mr. Steinborn was an unemployed jack of the building trades, down on his luck and in need of a job himself. Improbably enough, he is now one of the system's most attentive caseworkers -- "my guardian angel," a client said -- and a de facto authority on the nation's most famous welfare experiment. To an extent that is rare among the city's 150 caseworkers, Mr. Steinborn embodies the personal insight and attention the system claims to dispense.
In theory, personalized casework was supposed to be a hallmark of Wisconsin's welfare-to-work program, called Wisconsin Works, or W-2. In practice, most poor people see their caseworkers as distant, or even antagonistic, enforcers of unpopular new work rules. Yet with little formal preparation outside his own street-smart past, Mr. Steinborn, a white man whose clients are mostly black women, has shown a knack for earning their trust.
"Like a brother," said Dinah Doty.
"My friend," said Shelley Block.
"A blessing," said Angiwetta Hills.
A self-deprecating man who can talk at length about his sense of failure and futility, Mr. Steinborn, 31, is not one to see himself starring in a sunny story of social progress. He took the job in skepticism ("I thought there was going to be an in-the-streets revolution."), graduated to despair ("I thought, I'm not going to last a week."), and found himself steeped in resentment ("You're lied to on a constant basis.").
Indeed, to see W-2 as Mr. Steinborn does -- case by painful case, 10 hours a day -- is to grow newly wary of simplistic efforts to reduce its impact to slogans.
"Is it working?" he said, repeating the obvious question, after multiple efforts to deflect it. "The honest answer is I don't think we can judge by the people who are in the program now. We'll know when their kids are working age."
While Mr. Steinborn's experience offers a candid look at the struggles inside W-2, it is also revealing in a more personal way. Across the country, the new welfare laws are reshaping not only the poor, but also society's perceptions of the poor. Mr. Steinborn, a man who has been mulling inner-city poverty virtually all his life, is an intriguing case in point.
The son of a central-city landlord, he was raised in the same neighborhood as most of his clients, among them yet apart. He began chasing tenants for his father's rents when he was 10. He took pride in never backing down from a neighborhood fight and had his nose broken three times. The last thing he brought to his new occupation was a sentimental view of the poor.
"I never wanted to be a sucker for a sob story," he said.
But Mr. Steinborn said casework has taught him something he missed in street fights and lease disputes: the hidden hurt that most of his clients feel.
"There's a lot of sadness and a lot of depression in the people I deal with," he said. "They don't want to be perceived as vulnerable. But when you cut away the exterior, they're sad -- sad for themselves, sad for their children, sad that they haven't done more with their lives. And they're just aching for you to listen -- not necessarily to solve their problem, just to listen.
"I'm not sure if I knew this before and chose to forget it, or if I'm learning it for the first time."
 
The Link
Going to World Wise From Computer Wise
Caseworkers were supposed to be the stars of the new program, which began in 1997. "More of the success of Wisconsin Works will ride on the talents, training and strategic deployment of the new group" of caseworkers than on any other aspect of W-2, its designers wrote in their initial proposal.
The redesigned caseworker was seen as a teacher, preacher, friend and cop -- an all-purpose partner to guide poor parents into jobs. To attract new talent, the state put the program up for bid, with five private agencies (two profit-seeking and three nonprofit) winning the contracts in Milwaukee.
The vision was more exceptional than it sounds. Personalized casework all but disappeared from the welfare system two generations ago, derided by welfare rights advocates as paternalistic (the poor need money, not advice, they said) and shunned by budget offices as frightfully expensive. By the late 1960's, the typical caseworker was a clerk, churning out checks to hundreds of families while knowing almost nothing about them.
W-2 sought to get personal, specifying that each worker serve no more than 55 families at a time. Yet the role of the caseworkers is different from that of traditional social workers who push clients toward education or counseling. With a focus on immediate employment, caseworkers steer as many clients as possible into regular wage-paying jobs, while assigning others to a workfare program in exchange for their monthly checks of $673. To emphasize the new get-a-job ethos, the caseworkers have a new name: financial and employment planners, or Feps.
While W-2 is more personal than the system it replaced, most caseworkers still function in a largely administrative role, still more like clerks than confidants. In part, that is because most clients are reluctant to disclose personal problems (like drug abuse or depression), especially to an authority figure who controls their monthly checks.
In part, it is because relationships are often short-lived. Cases are assigned geographically, so clients who move, as the poor often do, typically get a new caseworker. And much of the caseworker's job still involves managing data, not people; they are largely judged on how well they keep records in a complicated state computer program.
"The concept of the Fep was fantastic," said Keith Garland, a manager at Maximus, one of the two profit-seeking companies that run the program in Milwaukee. "But I don't know that overall the system has had the type of people who have fit the bill."
In the summer of 1998, Mr. Garland set out to find a different kind of caseworker, someone less computer-literate than world-wise, someone like Mr. Steinborn.
At the time, Mr. Steinborn needed employment planning himself. He was a 30-year-old, jobless, blue-collar guy with an ex-wife, a 4-year-old son and a pregnant girlfriend. He had dropped out of college, driven a cab, hung sheet rock, started a business mowing abandoned city lots and lost it in a fight with his partner. Then he sat at home, brooding.
A high school test had predicted he would make a good social worker, but Mr. Steinborn had scoffed. "I said, 'You think I'm going to be some underpaid, overworked social worker?' " he said. But over a beer one night, a friend told him that Maximus was hiring, with annual salaries at nearly $30,000. He borrowed five dress shirts from his father and swallowed his pride as a guy who avoided desk jobs. "I needed the money," he said.
 
The Super Worker
Becoming Addicted To Helping Clients
In two months of training at Maximus, Mr. Steinborn had one thought: "What have I gotten myself into?" He had no problem talking across economic or racial lines (both his ex-wife and girlfriend are black) but the policy manual was inches thick, and entering the wrong computer code meant a family might not get a check.
He winced at his mistakes and laid awake at night. He dreaded going to work so much he kicked a hole in his bedroom wall. Meanwhile, the caseworker assigned to train him was arrested for asking clients for kickbacks. (That caseworker was acquitted by a jury in October.) Mr. Steinborn's supervisor caught him filling out an application for a job cutting plate glass.
"This isn't like putting up dry wall," Mr. Steinborn said. "You're messing with people's live."
Then something strange happened. He entered what he now self-mockingly calls his "SuperFep" stage. "I began to think I could solve everyone's problems," he said.
When a client dragged her feet in applying for a job, Mr. Steinborn drove her to an interview. (She did not get hired.) When a client needed child care, Mr. Steinborn arranged to meet her son at school and drive him to a day-care center. (She skipped her training program anyway.)
One day, the mother of a child with cerebral palsy arrived in his office. By the book, Mr. Steinborn was merely supposed to offer her a list of specialized child-care centers. Instead, he spent three hours placing calls, until he found a promising lead.
His client never visited the child-care center. But she did visit a legal aid office, to complain that Mr. Steinborn had failed to appreciate the needs of her child. She dropped the complaint at the ensuing hearing, saying she had gotten confused. ("I felt sorry for Michael -- he really did try to help me," she said in a recent interview.)
The planning manual urged caseworkers to teach the poor to solve their own problems -- to "empower" rather than "enable" them. Then again, the theorists had never met the Woman Without a Coat.
"Mi-ii-ke," she yelled by way of introduction on the coldest day of the year. "Mi-ii-ke, I need a coat."
She stood too close. She talked too loud. He thought she might be mentally retarded. When a check of clothing programs turned up nothing, Mr. Steinborn ran four blocks through the snow and returned from a thrift store with a $9 coat.
Wrong size, she complained.
He went back and bought another.
Wrong color, she complained.
A few days later, coatless again, she told his supervisor that no one would help her.
Mr. Steinborn spent months listening to her rambling monologues until he assembled the outlines of her story. She said she had been reared by a respected church-going family and lowered to prostitution by drugs. She said she had been sober, though still poor and addled, nearly two years.
When she was faced with eviction, Mr. Steinborn arranged a special grant and found a housing counselor to help her. She cursed out the counselor and told Mr. Steinborn's supervisor she had been abandoned.
SuperFep lost it.
When he asked if she was still smoking crack, she said she had been clean for three days. "Three days," he screamed. "You told me you hadn't used in two years."
He urged her to seek treatment and she angrily refused. Instead, she and her 8-year-old son moved to a homeless shelter, and her case was transferred to another agency.
"A small part of me knew it the whole time, but my whole heart really sank into my stomach," Mr. Steinborn said. "I felt really stupid and useless. I felt betrayed, even though it wasn't about me. I was almost as addicted to helping her as she was to crack."
He vowed to go back to dry wall.
 
The Surprises
Very Hard Cases Yield Small Triumphs
He also tried to lower his expectations.
With the welfare rolls in Milwaukee down 85 percent, most of the remaining cases are hard ones. Among his clients, about 1 in 8 get a job each month, and most quickly lose them. Success -- at least the kind of life-transforming success he once hoped to see -- is rare. "Sometimes I just have to be happy that someone showed up," he said.
Still, there are surprises.
Mr. Steinborn keeps tacked to his wall a copy of a certificate from a woman he barely knows, Angiwetta Hills. He spent hours untangling the computer transfer of her case from another agency, allowing her to receive her first check in months. Ms. Hills, 23, who was living in a homeless shelter, surprised him with perfect attendance in a motivation class, an achievement that is not quite a new life (or even a new job), but still a morsel of encouragement.
The surprise ran in both directions. Having spent months in limbo between two agencies, Ms. Hills had not expected to find a worker willing to help. "He said, 'Everything's going be all right, Angiwetta -- you put in your half and I'll put in mine,' " she said. Now out of the shelter and at yet another agency, Ms. Hills dramatized her view of most caseworkers' attitude by dialing her new worker's number. The voice mail said, "Try to call only once a week."
Likewise, Mr. Steinborn had few expectations of Dinah Doty, 23, who arrived with a scant work history, no high-school degree and on the verge of having her fourth child. Then after a few months of talks, she walked in one day and said she was employed. In this case, Ms. Doty did seem transformed. "She was almost glowing," Mr. Steinborn said. He insists he contributed nothing but Ms. Doty disagrees. "Michael gave me that motivation to get up and basically open my eyes," she said. "Michael understands where I'm coming from."
In that, she may be more right than she knows. After a decade of mourning his own failures -- in college, marriage and business -- what most surprises Mr. Steinborn about social work is how deeply he identifies with many of his clients.
"I can relate to the desperate part of them, the part that doesn't even know how you're going to make it to the next day," he said. "Because I've felt that more than once in my life, and it's scary."
To the outside world, the case he calls his proudest success may not seem like much. Shelley Block, the woman who did not "do mornings," is now a part-time bus driver at an after-school program. But without Mr. Steinborn's help, she said, she would not be working at all.
When she arrived in his office last January, he encountered a 300-pound woman with a pierced tongue, a tattooed arm and what she herself calls a "really bad attitude." He took to her right away. He coaxed her into a work assignment inside the Maximus office, where they talked, all the time. "I would say, 'Michael, I can't believe I'm telling you this," she said. When she confided last summer that her boyfriend had beaten her, Mr. Steinborn delivered the finest you-are-somebody lecture Ms. Block had ever heard.
"He said, 'I can see you behind a desk some day, making sound money,' " she said. "He said, 'Don't ever let anybody put you down.' He gave me so much confidence I cried -- I did -- when I walked out."
Not long after, Mr. Steinborn was in another trough. When he told Ms. Block he wanted to quit, the pep talk this time was hers. "I told him people were depending on him," she said. "I told him, 'Don't quit!' "
Mr. Steinborn, the bruised idealist who sometimes thinks he is a cynic, listened, for now. "I still go back and forth between, 'I can help them change their lives' and 'Who am I kidding?' " he said. "There's no happy-ever-after as a caseworker."
 
Life After Welfare
With the nation's welfare rolls down 43 percent, President Clinton, as well as his Republican critics, count the landmark 1996 welfare law as the cornerstone of their respective legacies. That law replaced a 60-year-old cash safety net with a program of time limits and work requirements.
No place has come closer than Wisconsin to the goal of "ending welfare." A decade ago, 100,000 Wisconsin families relied on public aid. Now 7.900 do.
The changes taking place in the state, particularly in its largest city, Milwaukee, continue to reverberate in broad and unpredictable ways. Throughout the year, The New York Times is returning to Milwaukee to plot the pattern of change.

HEADLINE: University of Chicago Choses Cornell Provost

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
The University of Chicago, which has experienced internal turmoil over changes to its curriculum and efforts to expand, has chosen as its next president the provost of Cornell University.
A search committee's selection of the 59-year-old Cornell official, Don Michael Randel, was announced by the University of Chicago yesterday, and the chairman of the university's trustees, Edgar Jannotta, who oversaw the search, said the choice was to be ratified by the board at a meeting on Monday. 
 Dr. Randel, an expert in the music of the Renaissance and the Middle Ages, has been Cornell's provost since 1995. He will succeed Hugo F. Sonnenschein, who has been Chicago's president since 1993.
Mr. Sonnenschein, who has promoted several changes at the university that some critics maintain will diminish the rigor of its undergraduate education, announced in June that he would return to teaching in the economics department next year.
One of Dr. Randel's first tasks will be to quell the uproar that has resulted from Mr. Sonnenschein's efforts to attract more undergraduate applicants by increasing the size of the student body, trimming the core curriculum and making the university's reputation generally less stuffy.
Dr. Randel, who is expected to continue with the direction of Mr. Sonnenschein's approach, said the ferocity of the debate had left him confident of the strength of the university's dedication to its mission.
"That the alumni and the faculty and students care so much about the core curriculum to engage in a rigorous debate is a good sign," he said in an interview, "not a sign of trouble."
Dr. Randel also said "the university doesn't need a turnaround artist."
Rather, he intends to engage students, faculty and graduates "in a discussion about how the university will continue to remake itself, as it has from the beginning."
As a result of Mr. Sonnenschein's initiative, the faculty last year approved a revision of the core curriculum that each undergraduate student must complete.
The core courses, which had accounted for half the 42 courses required for graduation, now account for 15 or 18, depending on how a foreign language requirement is counted.

HEADLINE: Cuba's Dubious Outcry

 BODY:

To the Editor:
There is more to the demonstrations in Cuba than a spontaneous outpouring of feeling over the fate of the 6-year-old boy in Miami separated from his father in Cuba (news article, Dec. 10).
The highly organized demonstrations are a textbook example of the demagogic reflexes of a totalitarian regime. The dutiful crowds provide a wonderful diversion from a chronically mismanaged economy, endemic shortages, corruption and the capriciousness of President Fidel Castro, whose policies generated the desperate escapes of the putative beneficiaries of his system in the first place. 
 Mr. Castro could not miss the opportunity to whip up another display of nationalistic indignation against the foreign evil (the United States) that will remain the scapegoat for Cuba's ills as long as he stays in power and continues to manipulate and mismanage the lives of his subjects.

HEADLINE: Historians' Report Blames Swiss for Barring Jews During War

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON 

DATELINE: BERN, Switzerland, Dec. 10

 BODY:
A panel of independent historians has concluded that wartime Swiss officials refused entry to thousands of Jewish refugees even after it was known that they faced almost certain death in Nazi Germany.
By the summer of 1942 at the latest, the historians said in their detailed 350-page report, the Swiss authorities were aware that Jews were being annihilated by the Third Reich. 
 The historians also said there was no evidence that accepting many more asylum seekers would have put neutral Switzerland in danger of "invasion by the Axis or caused insurmountable economic difficulties." They thus rejected an argument advanced in Switzerland's defense after earlier disclosures of the country's treatment of Jews trying to escape the Holocaust.
Rather, the report cited anti-Semiticsm and an entrenched fear of foreigners in Switzerland as the reasons the authorities turned away more than 24,000 Jews.
Swiss officials "became involved in the crimes of the Nazi regime by abandoning the refugees to their persecutors," Jean-Francois Bergier, the Swiss historian who headed the panel, said at a news conference today.
The study is part of a larger historical inquiry, commissioned by the Swiss government, that produced another report last year on Switzerland's gold transactions with Hitler's Germany. Earlier this week, a separate report by Swiss banks and American Jewish groups found that 54,000 Swiss bank accounts might be linked to Holocaust victims.
The latest report was prepared during the last two years by nine historians from Switzerland, Israel, the United States, Britain and Poland who had unprecedented access to the Swiss national archives as part of Switzerland's effort to come to terms with its wartime history. Jewish groups praised the new report, but there were complaints from the government and from some private groups that the sharply critical study failed to measure official actions against the troubled international situation at the time.
Although the report did not delve deeply into other countries' treatment of World War II refugees, the historians said at the news conference that Sweden, also neutral during World War II, had been significantly more helpful than Switzerland. Sweden, like Switzerland, had limited Jewish immigration between 1938 and 1942, but reversed its policy after officials learned of the mass killings of Jews.
Switzerland followed suit only in July 1944, when it declared that persecution for being Jewish was a valid ground for granting asylum.
Switzerland's governing body, the Federal Council, issued a statement today saying the country's asylum policy "was marred by errors, omissions and compromises" -- renewing its 1995 apology for wartime refugee policy. "Nothing can make good the consequences of decisions taken at the time, and we pay our respects before the pain of those who were denied access to our territory and were abandoned to unspeakable suffering, deportation and death," the seven ministers said.
But the ministers said the report ignored "fears generated by the threat facing Switzerland, the uncertainty about the future, as well as the necessity of maintaining foreign trade to ensure the country's survival."
Switzerland took in 51,000 civilian refugees during the war, including some 21,000 Jews, although many of those had slipped into the country illegally and were then allowed to stay.
There were some heroes among Swiss officials, particularly among consular employees who "were liberal in granting entry visas," but the report details specific instances of serious "human suffering" to highlight the impact of Swiss refugee policy.
The study cited as particularly egregious the Swiss push for a requirement, enacted in 1938, that German passports for Jews be stamped with a "J." It also cited the closing of the border with Germany in 1942 to refugees persecuted solely because they were Jews.
"Without Swiss pressure, the passports would not have been stamped until later, perhaps not at all," the report concluded. "This would have made it less difficult for refugees to find a country willing to accept them."
The report was particularly critical of the 1942 decision to close Swiss borders to Jews even though senior officials were "aware of the fact the refugees sent back were being threatened with deportation to Eastern Europe culminating in death."
Although there was some public protest, the Swiss authorities stepped up rejections of asylum seekers -- even denying most the right to pass through the country to other destinations -- declining to "help people in mortal danger," the report said.
In an annex to the report, the historians exonerated Switzerland of accusations that Jews being deported from France and Italy could have crossed Switzerland by train on their way to the gas chamber, concluding there was no evidence to support that.
In New York, the president of the World Jewish Congress, Edgar Bronfman, called the report "a landmark event in Swiss and European history" and "an example for other European nations to follow."

HEADLINE: U.S. Is Trying To Put Teeth In Inspections Of Iraq Arms

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 10

 BODY:
As disagreements between the United States and Russia continue to delay action on a new arms-inspection plan for Iraq, independent disarmament experts are divided over how important it is to try to put in place an airtight monitoring system if the cost is Security Council unity against President Saddam Hussein.
The council today put off a vote on the inspection plan until Monday, at the request of China, which, along with Russia, has reservations. But council members did extend the "oil for food" program in Iraq for six months. 
 "This is really a case where the best is the enemy of the good," said Spurgeon M. Keeny Jr., president of the Arms Control Association, a research organization in Washington that publishes Arms Control Today. "Obviously the best would be to get rid of the Iraqi regime and find every last piece of equipment that accumulated before the gulf war or since. But we can't get international support for that."
Mr. Keeny, a former deputy director of the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, advises Washington to be flexible where possible to gain consensus, then "claim victory and get on with perfecting the continued inspection regime."
He spoke in an interview today as American and British diplomats spent another day trying to narrow differences with Russia, China and, on some points, France, to avoid a Russian veto of the resolution for a new-weapons monitoring commission for Iraq. Iraq has not had international inspections for a year.
A Russian veto would kill the plan, leaving in place economic sanctions on Iraq that may become increasingly unenforceable. A Russian abstention would advertise council divisions, a boon to Iraq.
The Russians argue that if -- a big if -- Iraq is judged to be cooperating with a new system to be installed by the proposed United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency within a given period of time or has met a predetermined list of tasks, then sanctions should be suspended while inspection work goes on.
The United States wants the inspectors to list tasks to be accomplished after, not before, they begin work on the ground. In the past, those demands on the Iraqis have included providing documents, allowing interviews with Iraqi officials or opening new sites to inspectors.
The Russians and French complain that the wording in the resolution, introduced formally today by the British, is not clear enough about what the Iraqis are expected to do and is an invitation for Americans to move the finish line at will.
The American representative, Peter Burleigh, disagreed, saying three paragraphs in the resolutions made it "very clear what needs to be done." He called the draft now being considered "an artful and constructive way of dealing with some difference of opinion in the council."
But attempts to juggle wording to prevent a Russian veto worry David Albright, president of the independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington and a former nuclear inspector in Iraq. He noted as an example that an earlier provision that suggested that experts could be drawn from Unscom, the previous inspection commission, had been stripped from the final draft.
"Taking out that language is certainly a warning," Mr. Albright said. "There are enough questions in the resolution that the next steps are going to be critically important in determining the effectiveness of the inspection regime: 'Who will be the head of the commission? Will Unmovic the inspection team have sufficient experience to conduct inspections? Will their decisions be constantly second-guessed by Security Council members, who will have authority to approve or disapprove the inspectors' work plans?"
Richard Butler, former executive chairman of the inspection team, said the resolution seemed to give the new commission far less independence than he had. "Its head will be supervised by what can only be called a political board," he said.
The College of Commissioners intended to oversee the commission will have the right to review all its policy decisions.
"The mandate seems right," Mr. Butler added. "But the instrument through which it is to be achieved has been made far less independent." aid.
The creation of a singular disarmament commission as a policy tool is an interesting experiment, Ruth Wedgwood, a law professor at Yale said. "When Unscom was founded, it was a brilliantly new form of multidimensional verification," she said. "But the experiment is somewhat spoiled already, because any future target of an Unscom inspection could take heart from Iraq's success in breaking up the Security Council alliance."

HEADLINE: Sisyphus of the Sneaker Makers

BYLINE: BySHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
Things looked promising at the Reebok store on Manhattan's Upper West Side last Saturday. Dozens of screaming teenagers stood outside waiting to get in. Inside, younger children scrambled amid the milling adults as music pulsed and members of the Harlem Globetrotters basketball team signed autographs.
All the hoopla surrounded the introduction of Traxtar, a children's shoe with a computer chip to help measure athletic performance. But most of the screaming adolescents were there to see No Authority, a pop music group, and few of the people attending the promotion were wearing Reebok sneakers -- or planning to buy any. 
 The scene highlights the problems facing Reebok International, once the nation's premier sneaker maker and now the laggard in this country's large but stagnant $13.8 billion athletic-footwear industry.
Through the introduction of the Traxtar and a campaign for an updated version of its stalwart Classic sneakers, Reebok is trying yet again to regain cachet with consumers and reverse a decline in market share that has continued for a decade.
The company could use a boost. It has slipped to No. 3 in the world market, steadily losing market share over the decade to Nike, the market leader, and to reinvigorated brands like Adidas (now No. 2 worldwide).
But its strategy is a big gamble, because Reebok is seemingly writing off the huge and important teenage market to distinguish itself from Nike.
While adolescents and young adults make up about 42 percent of the athletic footwear market, they are more likely than their parents to buy several pairs of sneakers and to buy the latest top-of-the-line models, at more than $150 a pair. And their imprimatur can often make or break a brand.
"We're focusing on innovation and luxury," said Paul Fireman, chairman of Reebok, which also makes Reebok brand apparel and accessories as well as Rockport, Polo/Ralph Lauren and Greg Norman footwear and apparel. "Fashion has moved from the hokey-looking products to more streamlined" styles, he added. And Reebok is betting that its Classic styles will strike a chord with fashionable feet of all ages.
As for coolness, "We stopped trying to chase that," said Angel R. Martinez, chief marketing officer of the Reebok division, which accounts for 80 percent of the company's revenue. "We were able to establish footwear as the badge of a lifestyle; that's what we're really going back to," he said, recalling the company's early success as it cashed in on the shift to casual footwear and the aerobics craze of the 1980's.
That success, however, was followed by a string of unsuccessful strategies in the 1990's that were intended to fend off rivals. First, hefty spending on celebrity endorsements failed and Reebok's performance footwear was unpopular. The company refocused on women's shoes in 1992 but lost out to more fashionable competitors. A new technology in 1997 suffered from poor marketing and unattractive styling.
After a decade of missteps, missed opportunities and management shakeups, few analysts are convinced that the company's newest initiatives will pull Reebok out of its slump. What the company needs, they say, is a consistent message.
"The problem with Reebok is that they've gotten very excited about a number of products over the years," but the company's efforts have not always translated into strong sales, said Josie Esquivel of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "They were losing market share during the growth of the industry," Ms. Esquivel added. "They're not perceived as being cool and having their act together."
Last year, Reebok's earnings fell 82 percent, to $23.9 million from $135.1 million in 1997. Sales, which have been declining since 1995, were down 11.5 percent last year, to $3.2 billion. Its profit margin also plunged, down more than 80 percent, to seven-tenths of 1 percent. And the company's shares have lost more than 80 percent of their value in the last three years, closing at $8 yesterday. Its 12 percent share in the world market put it behind Nike, with 33 percent, and Adidas of Germany, with about 16 percent. In the United States, it was still in second place, behind Nike, but its market share has been falling.
And when Nike faltered in 1998, because of Asia's economic slump and as teenagers deemed the styles uncool, Reebok was unable to gain ground, as other competitors, including New Balance, did.
In the first nine months of 1999, sales were $2.28 billion, down 9.6 percent from a year earlier. In September, as part of a restructuring, Reebok laid off 120 employees at its headquarters in Stoughton, Mass., and announced plans to cut an additional 500 jobs around the world -- a total of nearly 10 percent of its work force. Cuts were also made last year.
While industry sales in the United States are forecast to fall slightly this year before rising in 2000, several competitors, including Nike and New Balance, are expected to gain market share. Reebok could end up tied with New Balance Athletic Shoe, with about 8 percent of the United States market, said John Shanley, an analyst with First Security Van Kasper. He estimates that Nike will have about 50 percent, followed by Adidas, with 10 percent.
And just last week, Carl J. Yankowski, who had been president and chief executive of the Reebok division for only 15 months, resigned to return to the technology industry. Mr. Fireman is taking over his duties and few analysts expect Mr. Yankowski's departure to deeply affect Reebok's fortunes. The departure is, however, the latest in a series of recent management changes and another example of the problems Reebok must overcome.
Things were not always so bad.
In 1987, propelled by the women's aerobic fitness craze, Reebok overtook Nike as the largest athletic footwear company in America.
But the companies' positions reversed again in 1989, and in the last few years Reebok has been unable to increase shelf space with retailers. Some styles were deemed unattractive. Analysts complain -- and the company acknowledges -- that Reebok has no uniform message or concise marketing campaign.
Reebok was forced to back away from its efforts to emulate Nike's success through a focus on competitive sports and celebrity endorsements, ending costly contracts with many athletes, including Shaquille O'Neal.
Analysts say that Reebok's DMX performance technology, which puts moving air in the sole for added comfort, was a good one. But while DMX, introduced in 1997, was popular in running shoes, the company could not transfer that success across product lines. Reebok also had difficulty getting professional athletes to switch to their products.
Oversaturation from its focus on mass-market retailers like Sears, Roebuck and J. C. Penney caused Reebok to become victim to heavy discounting. The company also lost credibility with speciality retailers like Foot Locker and among teenagers.
"Kids don't want to shop at a J. C. Penney," said John Horan, publisher of Sporting Goods Intelligence, an industry newsletter. "And Foot Locker doesn't want that stuff if it's all over the place."
In addition, niche players like Saucony and K-Swiss have hurt Reebok's Classic program with their clean, simple styles at similar prices -- $50 to $80.
But Reebok officials are betting that the Traxtar and new Classic designs will build on the success it has had with products like its Allen Iverson basketball shoe and Polo/ Ralph Lauren lines.
The Traxtar uses a microprocessor and motion detection technology to measure how fast children run and how high and how far they jump. Lights on an oval pod on the tongue of the shoe glow and music is played as performance is measured.
"As we look at the kids' marketplace, it's becoming more interactive," said Matt Feiner, director of children's footwear global product marketing. "We wanted to be the first to bring it into footwear."
Reebok said it would spend about $6 million to market Traxtar in 2000, triple what it is spending on children's shoes this year.
The company hopes the Traxtar, which will sell for around $60 a pair, will be just the beginning of a new line of "smart shoes" for children and adults. Plans are being considered, for example, for a walking shoe with a built-in chip to measure distance and speed.
The new campaign for Classics will begin in early 2000. Reebok plans to position the line as stylish, well made and upscale, with ads in publications like Vogue, In Style and GQ.
The Classics, long known as a simply styled white sneaker, will come in more colors and a modified design, and will be made of nubuck -- a brushed leather -- as well as soft leather. The company hopes the updated styles will encourage sales of Reebok apparel as well as catch the eye of teenagers.
To push the line, Reebok will spend about $15 million on print and billboard ads next year. Company executives say Reebok has never before spent more than $1 million a year on the line.
The company is also planning a new basketball shoe, called Blacktop, and a new fitness shoe for women with DMX technology, later next year.
Wall Street remains unconvinced that Reebok has found a winning path.
Some dismiss the Traxtar as a fad.
And technology, they say, is not what sells sneakers.
"Reebok has this DMX technology, but nobody cares," said Allison Malone, an analyst with Off the Record Research, an investment research company based in San Francisco. "The biggest demographic, these teenagers, they only care about fashion."
"Classics have a following among older ladies," Ms. Malone added. "They're going to have to appeal to a larger base."
Then there's the competition.
Adidas as well as smaller companies like New Balance and K-Swiss have made inroads in the children's and sports performance market.
And earlier this month Nike introduced Nikeid, which the company calls an "interactive, design-a-shoe experience." Customers can use the Internet to order two models of customized sneakers, choosing the shoe color and adding a nametag.
Reebok is a financially strong company with high brand recognition. But if its products do not excite more consumers, analysts warn, it will continue to lose credibility.
"How many lives do they have?" Ms. Esquivel asked. "Winning back is a lot harder than starting off fresh."

In 1983, when Reebok was just beginning its meteoric rise, the wholesale athletic shoe market in the United States totaled $1.7 billion. Now worth $7.4 billion, the market has grown roughly 330%, but Reebok has lost ground since its peak in 1986. It is now in danger of losing second place to Adidas.

HEADLINE: Xerox Says Its Earnings Will Tumble

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
The Xerox Corporation stunned investors yesterday by announcing after the market closed that its fourth-quarter earnings would be about 40 percent lower than analysts had expected.
Shares of Xerox closed at $20.0625, a 14 percent drop, and continued skidding in after-hours trading. 
 The company's chief executive, G. Richard Thoman, blamed the disappointment on a range of problems, including Year 2000 computer fears that have caused customers to suspend capital investments, an internal reorganization that Xerox has struggled with and economic troubles in Brazil.
The combination, he told analysts yesterday, "has surprised us."
More broadly, the announcement by the company, which is based in Stamford, Conn., raises concerns about Xerox's attempt to transform itself from a company making freestanding copiers into one that sells digital printers connected to computer networks.
Doing so requires that Xerox reorganize to focus more on service and outsourcing and that it compete against both longtime rivals like Canon -- which is now doing well -- and new ones like Hewlett-Packard.
So far, analysts said yesterday, the company has failed to accomplish everything at once.
"It obviously seems like there are some very severe problems within the company," said Benjamin A. Reitzes, an analyst at PaineWebber. Over the last year, Xerox's shares have lost more than two-thirds of their value, falling from a high of $63.9375 on May 3.
Yesterday's announcement comes on the heels of a poor third quarter in which Xerox's net profits declined by 11 percent, to $339 million, and analysts lowered their expectations for fourth-quarter earnings to 66 cents a share, from an original high of 92 cents. Mr. Thoman now thinks the company will earn closer to 40 cents a share in the fourth quarter.
In recent months, Mr. Reitzes said, "Every problem seems to have gotten worse."
The trouble is not likely to end with this century, either. "The first quarter won't be a lot better than what we now see," Mr. Thoman said, noting that many of the problems will linger. He added, however, that Xerox's profits should start to recover in the second quarter and continue to do so throughout 2000.
By their very nature, Year 2000 worries will soon end. Many economists believe Brazil will begin to recover as well, and Mr. Thoman said the company's reorganized structure would soon begin to overcome its initial problems.
But analysts seemed unwilling to give Mr. Thoman and his management much benefit of the doubt. During yesterday's conference call, analysts chastised Mr. Thoman for not coming clean about problems sooner, wondered whether the future would hold more unpleasant surprises and complained that he did not talk to Wall Street often enough.
Mr. Thoman took over the top job in April, after leaving I.B.M. in 1997 to become Xerox's heir apparent to Paul A. Allaire, its chairman.
About 20 percent of the earnings shortfall will come from higher-than-expected costs from the company's consolidation of its 36 administrative centers into just 3, Mr. Thoman said. Because Xerox did not dedicate enough people to handling the change, sales representatives -- who are also in the midst of their own shift from covering a geographic area to covering specific industries -- have spent too much time dealing with internal matters.
Xerox is now making "a full-court press" to fix the administrative problems, Mr. Thoman said yesterday.
At the same time, it is trying to shift toward businesses that are growing by at least 10 percent a year, such as the outsourcing of managing documents. Twenty-five percent of Xerox's revenue now comes from such industries; by the end of 2000, the portion should rise to 45 percent, the company said.
Despite the problems, Mr. Thoman said Xerox had little choice but to try such wide-ranging change. "The market is moving quickly," he told analysts. "Customers are not going to wait for us."

HEADLINE: Beliefs;
When all the religions of the world are truly global, some old issues assume new forms.

BYLINE: By Peter Steinfels 

 BODY:
Globalization: it's a curious contraption of a word, a noun built on a verb, globalize, built on an adjective, global, built on a noun, globe. By now, however, the word not only rolls around rather easily in the mouth; it has also become irreplaceable for discussing the kind of issues that brought demonstrators to the streets in Seattle a week ago. It is also a notion applicable to religion.
The Parliament of the World's Religions, which drew thousands of religious leaders to Cape Town between Dec. 1 and Dec. 8, was a colorful reminder of religious globalization. The original such parliament was held in 1893 in Chicago, in connection with the World's Columbian Exposition. A hundred years later it was repeated, and now its organizers, based in Chicago, plan to make it a perennial event. 
 When the 6,000 participants were not hearing speakers like Nelson Mandela and the Dalai Lama, they were enjoying something like a global religious fair, rushing back and forth to hundreds of workshops and discussions. As in Seattle, there were even a few demonstrators, in this case denouncing the whole affair as satanic and, of all unlikely things, ridden with Zionists. But like the World Trade Organization's meeting, the parliament was only one manifestation of a process that is irreversibly under way.
The world's great faiths have always interacted, of course. They sent missionaries, they borrowed ideas, they adopted rituals. They even absorbed and transformed deities. And they fought wars. Sometimes they imitated one another, sometimes they defined themselves in contrast to one another.
But this usually happened when religions were neighbors geographically, or when a religion expanded through migration or conquest, or when one faith had emerged from another, like Christianity from Judaism or Buddhism from the brahmanism of Northern India, or simply when a few mobile and spiritually inquiring individuals cross-pollinated beliefs.
Just as economic globalization is of a completely different order than traditional overseas commerce, today's religious globalization barely resembles these earlier interactions among faiths.
Today, world religions are truly world religions. Every major faith is everywhere, represented by migrant populations or native converts, its beliefs and sacred texts available, at least in introductory form, to virtually any curious seeker. Pope John Paul II, the Rev. Billy Graham and the Dalai Lama are world figures with followings far beyond their own religious groups.
The very fact that marking the millennium has become a global event is suggestive. Even the most secular celebration cannot entirely erase the religious origins of a calendar that is now implanted in the daily life of historically non-Christian cultures.
But this free flow of religions, like free trade in cotton, computers and currencies, has created its own issues and added new twists to older ones. Many of the issues can be grouped under three headings: turf, tolerance and truth. But in fact they are all interrelated.
Turf is the most ancient of these concerns, the one that endures despite the fact -- and maybe because of the fact -- that barriers to religious alternatives are increasingly harder to maintain. Russian Orthodox leaders protest that Russia is their turf and everyone else is a religious intruder. Roman Catholic leaders often sound much the same way about Latin America. Hindus protest Christian conversions; Islam does the same. Orthodox Judaism claims prior rights in Israel.
Of course, there are opinions within each group challenging this religious equivalent of protectionism. There are vitally important distinctions, moreover, among religious bodies and leaders regarding the lengths to which they will go to protect their turf. There is a growing international lobby against religious persecution. There are advocates of an unrestricted religious marketplace who argue that rigorous competition makes faith stronger, not weaker. And there are also cautionary voices, in the religious sphere as in the economic one, warning that American standards, in this case of church-state separation, cannot be universalized.
Obviously the question of turf is linked to the question of tolerance. In principle, almost everyone favors tolerance. In practice, it can be more difficult to uphold and, sometimes, even to define.
Certainly one of the premises of the Parliament of the World's Religions was that tolerance, if it is to be more than a prolonged truce in religious warfare, requires real respect for one another's traditions, reflected in a willingness to engage in dialogue and cooperate in serving humanity and the environment.
That raises the issue of truth. To some people, genuine respect and tolerance are incompatible with claims that "I have the truth and you don't." To others, the demand that "I abandon my claims to the truth in the name of tolerance" is the very essence of intolerance.
In reality, religious globalization has already dramatically modified the way claims of religious truth are commonly made. Believers today are far less likely than before to deny all the truth in other faiths. The question becomes not true versus false religion, but which faith has the fuller truth, the more adequate grasp on a dimension of reality that will always remain mysterious.
That, of course, still conflicts with the conviction that every religion must be viewed as equally true, and that nothing less can be the basis of genuine respect and tolerance. But to propose that principle as the basis of religious globalization would probably arouse more opposition and outrage than anything the World Trade Organization ever dreamed of.

HEADLINE: TURKEY IS INVITED TO APPLY FOR SEAT IN EUROPEAN UNION

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE 

DATELINE: HELSINKI, Finland, Dec. 10

 BODY:
The European Union today accepted Turkey as a candidate for membership, reversing a thumbs-down vote two years ago, which was based mainly on Turkey's human rights record.
Membership, which is probably many years down the road, would mark the entry of the first Muslim country to the European Union. Turkey, which has long sought closer ties to Europe, is already a member of NATO. 
 The economic and political union also agreed to a plan to bring in more of the formerly Communist nations of Eastern and Central Europe, in the latest step to expand to the borders of Russia.
Alarm over Russian moves in Chechnya colored the summit conference of the 15-nation bloc in Helsinki. The national leaders put out a statement condemning the bombardment of cities in the territory as "totally unacceptable" and threatening to cut assistance to Moscow.
The statement said the European Union would review its common strategy on Russia, apply trade terms more strictly, suspend some provisions of a partnership agreement and shift funds from a technical program to "humanitarian needs" created by the crisis.
Turkey readily welcomed the European offer. "There might be details we find hard to accept," Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said in Ankara, "but in general the acceptance of our candidate status on equal conditions is a great success for Turkey."
Though Turkey has pursued European validation for years, it balked at some of the terms for its admittance today, and Javier Solana, the union's new foreign policy chief, was sent to Ankara to clarify them. "I'm going there just to explain what has been agreed by the E.U. summit," he said on leaving Helsinki.
To join, Turkey will have to make sweeping political and economic reforms and abolish its death penalty. Its neighbor Greece lately indicated its willingness to reconsider allowing Turkey to join it in the union.
Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen of Finland, current holder of the organization's rotating presidency, expressed hopes for a positive response and said Mr. Ecevit had been invited to the concluding lunch of the summit conference here on Saturday.
Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Malta were the countries gaining preliminary consideration for membership today. They fall into line behind six others already negotiating entry -- Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Poland and Slovenia.
It will be at least three years before the first of them becomes a full member, and it may be decades before all of them are admitted. Under the new plan, the union will expand to 28 member states by 2025, representing a population of 500 million.
While the requirement to improve its human rights record and enact social and political reforms is likely to make Turkey one of the later entrants, today's decision is considered significant for symbolizing a break with a long history of stereotyping of Turks as un-European.
The United States criticized the Europeans for spurning Turkey, a strategically located Muslim NATO ally, at the Euopean Union's summit meeting in Luxembourg in 1997. President Clinton called on the leaders to undo the offense when he visited Greece and Turkey last month.
It appeared that conditions sought by Greece might have given Ankara pause in accepting the invitation. Of particular concern to the Greeks was a provision under consideration saying the two countries should steer their Aegean border disputes to the International Court of Justice.
The overall mood of the conference, once envisioned as a conclusive, forward-looking pre-millennial gathering, was soured by disputes over France's defiance of the European Commission's lifting of the ban on British beef and Britain's objections to a 20 percent withholding tax on offshore investments favored by the other members.
"There has been some tough talk," Prime Minister Lipponen said in a grim news conference this evening. "Our discussions were not at all diplomatic in their language."
Barely mentioned in today's account of the meeting's accomplishments was the approval of the new European rapid reaction force that was once considered a centerpiece of the gathering. A European Security and Defense Initiative calling for such a force was adopted after a brief debate and some minor changes to the program put together by the alliance's principal military powers, Britain and France.
Washington, which at the beginning of the decade expressed interest in Europe's taking on military responsibility for regional conflicts, more recently expressed anxiety at a European force's potential to overlap with and detract from NATO.
Trying to address that concern, but leaving the matter vague, the summit declaration said, "The objective is for the union to have the autonomous capacity to take decisions and, where NATO as a whole is not engaged, to launch and then to conduct E.U.-led military operations in response to international crises."
The 60,000-member crisis response force is to be ready by 2003. The plan also calls for a separate military staff and a permanent political and security committee.
There has been a growing consensus -- especially since the war in Kosovo -- that Europe needs to restructure its military and build up its muscle. But many of the same nations have been cutting their own military outlays.

HEADLINE: Iraq Rules Out a Visit by the Pope; Political Factors Are Cited

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY 

DATELINE: ROME, Dec. 10

 BODY:
In the first major setback to Pope John Paul II's ambitious travel plans for the millennium, the Vatican said today that Iraq had ruled out a planned papal visit.
The 79-year-old Roman Catholic leader, who has long dreamed of visiting major biblical sites in 2000, had badly wanted to stop in Ur, an ancient city in Iraq believed to be the birthplace of Abraham. 
 But Vatican diplomats were unable to reach an agreement with Iraqi officials over a visit that the pope viewed as a strictly religious pilgrimage, but that was fraught with political overtones for both President Saddam Hussein and the United States, which had lobbied against the visit, fearing that it could lend legitimacy to the Iraqi leader.
Perhaps in the hope that a visit to Ur could yet be resurrected, Vatican officials gave a carefully neutral explanation today of how their diplomacy with Baghdad broke down.
"Iraqi authorities have informed the secretariat of state that the abnormal conditions in which Iraq finds itself due to the embargo and the no-flight zone, as well as the general situation in the region, do not permit a visit by the Holy Father to Ur to be organized properly," the Vatican spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, said in a statement.
The United Nations imposed the embargo in 1990 after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. American and British planes have patrolled no-flight zones in north and south Iraq since 1991.
Before today's announcement, a senior Vatican official explained privately that the Iraqis appeared preoccupied with the idea that the pope, by asking the United Nations to permit his plane to fly into Iraq, would in some way legitimize the sanctions.
The Vatican official said its envoys in Baghdad had explained that the pope would not ask for permission, but would merely inform the United Nations of his travel plans. But even though the pope has often condemned the sanctions, that argument failed to reassure Iraqi officials.
The Iraqi government may also have feared that during his trip, the pope would preach about human rights, as he does in almost every country he visits. Baghdad gave a strong hint of its concerns last fall, in a letter by Iraqi intellectuals published by the state news agency, which lectured the pope on what he should say during his visit, and expressed reservations about his message to Christians in a predominantly Muslim culture.
Vatican officials let it be known that they were offended by the letter.
American and British official visitors to the Vatican had lobbied against the trip, fearing that a papal meeting with Mr. Hussein would break the isolation imposed on Iraq. But the Vatican, which rejected those overtures as unwarranted interference in its affairs, was ultimately unable to overcome Baghdad's misgivings.
But in Iraq, where preparations for the visit to Ur had already begun,Catholic officials expressed their belief that the trip had only been postponed, not canceled.
Patriarch Raphael I Bidawid of the Chaldean Church told the Vatican's missionary news service, Fides, that concerns about the pope's security had put off the visit.
The pope plans to visit the Holy Land in March, but there are lingering questions about his trip to Nazareth, where the Catholic Church is opposed to the building of a mosque next to the city's main Catholic shrine.

HEADLINE: Deep in the Wilderness, a Growth Industry Is Blooming

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY with BARRY MEIER 

DATELINE: BERYL, Utah, Dec. 7

 BODY:
For parents like Mitchell and Jill Friedman of Great Neck, N.Y., the decision to enroll a child in a wilderness program for troubled teenagers is born of desperation, a last chance to rescue a life endangered by drugs, crime or simply aimlessness. In the Friedmans' case, the outcome was worth the anguish.
"It's wonderful -- I'm crying," Mr. Friedman said today at the graduation of his son, Jeffrey, from the Redcliff Ascent Outdoor Therapy Program. "The last year has been hell. Every day he was out of school, on the streets, somewhere, we were terrified. When we got him here, we finally breathed easier." 
 Jeffrey had just spent 83 days in the desert here in southwestern Utah, in a minimalist world without music, television or cellular phones. Like other wilderness therapy programs, Redcliff tries to strip away bad habits, build character and restore self-esteem by forcing teenagers to fend for themselves and one another through a daily routine of hiking, campfire-building, food preparation and latrine-digging, as well as high school course work. Counselors lead the participants through quiet periods of introspection each day, and psychiatrists and psychologists visit once a week to measure progress.
The satisfaction of people like the Friedmans notwithstanding, wilderness therapy has not been entirely trouble-free. In a widely publicized episode last Saturday, eight Redcliff boys attacked two counselors and fled into the desert. And over the last 10 years, at least four teenagers have died in such programs. Further, some experts question whether the approach provides any long-lasting benefits to wayward youths, contending that the results of "shocking" them with outdoor hardships quickly wear off when they return to their homes and, frequently, renew old habits with old friends.
But the successes have apparently been common enough to make this a growth industry. While the concept of wilderness therapy is hardly new -- the Dallas Salesmanship Club opened one of the first such camps for troubled youth 51 years ago -- it has exploded in recent years. Where there were once just a few scattered operations around the country, there are now hundreds of companies, most of them in Western states.
In large measure, the experts say, the programs' popularity stems from a growing inability of public schools to deal with severe behavioral problems or to identify signs of alienation that lead to drug use or violence. More families are seeking alternative solutions, and the robust national economy has enabled many to afford them. (Redcliff charges as much as $350 a day, and some teenagers stay for two months or more.) State and local courts also use the programs, as an alternative to jail.
No one knows the precise number of such programs, or the industry's rate of success. So many of the programs are new, their services are provided in varied settings, and no scientific survey has ever tried to measure their effectiveness.
But Mark Sklarow, executive director of the Independent Educational Consultants Association, a nonprofit company in Fairfax, Va., that helps families find solutions for their troubled children, said the number of programs had grown to "several hundred," compared with fewer than 25 less than a decade ago.
Typically a camp's population has swollen as well. Mitch Cole, manager of the Redcliff administrative office here, said that as recently as five years ago, only 16 teenagers were enrolled in the program on any given day. Now as many as 64 are participating.
"Working with children at risk is really a growth industry," said Helene Reynolds, an educational consultant in Princeton, N.J., who has recommended wilderness therapy programs, including Redcliff, to her clients. (One of those clients, she said, was the family of a boy involved in the assault on the counselors last Saturday.)
The rapid growth has brought a hodgepodge of oversight. There is no national regulation of the industry, and regulation by the states varies widely. Two industry organizations are engaged in accrediting or monitoring therapeutic wilderness programs for health, safety and program content, but one, the Association of Experiential Education, a trade group in Boulder, Colo., has accredited only 7 of the 165 of its members that offer some form of therapy. And the other, the National Association of Therapeutic Schools and Programs, in Savannah, Ga., which was formed in January, has yet to develop any standards, although it is working with 67 programs in 26 states.
Jerry Wells, executive director of the Koch Crime Institute, a research organization in Topeka, Kan., said that while the outward appearances were different, the underlying philosophy of wilderness programs was the same as that of military-style boot camps.
"The basic premise is that the lack of discipline and structure in their life has led them to bad decisions," Mr. Wells said of the participants. "Therefore, if you provide them with the structure, it will lead them to better decisions."
Mr. Cole, of Redcliff, conceded that wilderness programs were once typically run by people who had more of a military background than experience in therapy work. It was not uncommon, he said, to hear stories of youths' being treated as if they were attending boot camp.
But now, he said, Utah and most other states have strict health and safety regulations against the use of physical force, hazing or food deprivation as a means of discipline. A misbehaving Redcliff teenager who violates the rules by cursing will most likely be punished by having to carry a small rock on the next hike.
"That way, there's a constant reminder of breaking the rule," Mr. Cole said. "It also teaches you that there are consequences to your actions."
Nonetheless, in the last decade four teenagers, three of them in Utah, have died at wilderness camps because of mistreatment or abuse, said Bob MacDougall, who licenses the programs for the Utah Department of Human Services. The last of the Utah deaths occurred in 1994, he added, and all three companies involved in those deaths are now out of business.
Catherine Sutton of Ripon, Calif., whose daughter, Michelle, died nine years ago after a week in a Utah wilderness program called Summit Quest, said counselors had accused Michelle of faking flulike symptoms. Her death was attributed to dehydration.
And after Nicholaus Contreraz, 16, died of a lung infection last year at the Arizona Boys Ranch in Oracle, Ariz., his family won a $1 million settlement of a wrongful-death lawsuit that claimed he had been a victim of physical abuse at the hands of his counselors.
Like many other wilderness programs, Redcliff teaches its lessons of respect, compassion and self-esteem against a tableau of uninterrupted weeks, or even months, of hiking and camping through 580 square miles of rugged desert in southwestern Utah, where nighttime temperatures in winter routinely fall below 10 degrees.
The campers are sent out with only necessities: clothes appropriate for the time of year, sleeping gear and food, which they prepare for themselves and consume with utensils they carve out of tree branches. They dig their own latrines.
A Walkman? A portable radio? Forget it. Not even a wristwatch is allowed.
Rules are strictly enforced, and they include taboos against cursing, sarcasm and any questions about time beyond the present.
Program officials say they have found that the spartan regimen, which stresses teamwork over individualism and provides time for intense personal introspection through individual and group therapy, is the most direct way to save a wayward life.
Mr. Cole said that through follow-up interviews with parents six months after graduation, Redcliff officials estimated their success rate at 70 to 80 percent.
Jeffrey Friedman, who acknowledged that before he entered the program his life in Great Neck had collapsed into daily use of marijuana and indifference toward school, said he now easily recognized the parallel between working with a group in the wild and getting along with his parents and two older sisters.
"I learned a lot more about how things I did affected the group, like they affected my family," he said. "In the group, you have to work together. I realized that at home I was acting selfishly, and it brought down the whole family."
Todd Chavin of Evanston, Ill., also graduated today. His parents, Scott and Judy Chavin, stared at him in near-disbelief when he said, "I don't feel like Todd anymore."
"I've truly changed," he added. "I feel totally different. I'm happy again. I don't want to go home and smoke dope with my friends; I want to move on with my life and become a man."

Orosco Returns to Mets In a Trade for McElroy

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

DATELINE: ANAHEIM, Calif., Dec. 10

 BODY:
Less than an hour after he arrived on the scene, Steve Phillips struck. The general manager who a year ago brought the Mets Robin Ventura, Armando Benitez and Roger Cedeno pulled off the first trade of baseball's winter meetings today. But Jesse Orosco will not replace the offensive production that John Olerud took to Seattle.
Yes, Jesse Orosco is coming home. The Mets, with whom the 42-year-old relief pitcher began life as a major leaguer, got him back by trading Chuck McElroy to the Baltimore Orioles. But the swap will not rival the one that will send Ken Griffey Jr. closer to home. Wherever that is, whenever that happens. 
 This was an exchange of left-handed relievers who have had better seasons than they had last season. Orosco had a 5.34 earned run average in 65 games and walked 20 batters in 32 innings, but he also struck out 35. McElroy, whom the Mets obtained from Colorado last July 31, had a 5.50 e.r.a. in 56 games, though he was better with the Mets, at 3.38 in 15 appearances.
"It's going to be different," Orosco said in a conference call, commenting on his return to the Mets 12 years after they traded him to Los Angeles. Referring to an interleague game at Shea Stadium, he added: "When I went there two years ago, it was tingling. I was nervous. This will be different. I'll be in a Mets uniform."
Orosco, who gained a career-high 31 saves in a Mets uniform in 1984 and was a postseason hero in 1986, had to approve the trade as a player who has 10 years in the majors, including the last 5 with the same team. He said he approved it because he liked the makeup of the Mets. But he also approved it because he did not want to pitch for the Orioles' new manager, Mike Hargrove, who was Orosco's manager in Cleveland nearly a decade ago.
After Phillips announced the trade, he was asked -- jokingly -- if his work at the meetings was done. "Obviously," he said, laughing, "we have a lot to do. We're going to be very busy here."
Phillips's primary goals are to replace Olerud at first base and to add hitting. While at the five-day meetings, he will talk to agents for several free agents, including first basemen David Segui and David Nilsson and outfielder Greg Vaughn.
Vaughn's agent said Thursday that the Mets were seriously interested in his client, who hit 95 home runs the past two seasons, but that the Mets had not made an offer.
One player the Mets will not acquire is Carlos Delgado. The Toronto Blue Jays signed Delgado, their first baseman, today, giving him $36 million for three years. He had rejected their previous offer of $12 million a year for five years, and they had rejected his request for $38.25 million for three years.
Delgado, who last season hit 44 home runs and drove in 134 runs, accepted less money because the Blue Jays added a provision that will allow him to demand a trade after next season. If he makes such a demand and the Blue Jays do not trade him by the following Feb. 15, he can become a free agent.
The biggest name hovering over the meetings is Griffey. The Mets are among a very few teams that will at least talk with the Seattle Mariners about the possibility of a trade.
"We're going to talk to everybody," Phillips said when asked specifically about his interest in Griffey. "We'll see how we fit with those teams. Seattle is one of those teams."
The Mariners have never told the Mets which of their players they would want, and an executive familiar with the talks between the teams said the Mets had not made an offer for Griffey.
The Cincinnati Reds continue to be considered the team most likely to acquire the superstar center fielder. Jim Bowden, their general manager, is scheduled to meet with Pat Gillick, the Mariners' general manager, on Saturday morning. They have talked many times by telephone the past few weeks.
Some baseball people believe the only thing blocking a trade is Pokey Reese, the Reds' second baseman. The Mariners want him; the Reds do not want to trade him.
"No question you'd love to have the other guy, but I don't want to move Pokey," said Jack McKeon, the Reds' manager, who acknowledged that he had no say in the talks. "Pokey's a great kid. I love him. But I don't have any control over it. They'll do what they think is best for the club."
The Mets acquired Orosco because, Phillips said, he is better at getting left-handers out than John Franco and Dennis Cook, the other two left-handers in their bullpen. "Jesse gives us better balance in the bullpen with situational left-handers," Phillips said.
In the four seasons before 1999, Orosco held left-handed batters to a .166 average. But he was not as effective last season. They hit .270 against him.
There is not much difference economically in the trade. McElroy has two years left on his contract at salaries of $1.35 million and $1.45 million. Orosco will have a $1.1 million salary next season, and the Mets have an option in 2001 for $1.3 million. But the option will become guaranteed if Orosco pitches in 55 games next season. The last time he didn't pitch in that many games in a full season was 1991.
Orosco, who holds the major league record for appearances by a pitcher with 1,090, was asked today how much longer he plans to play. He said his agent and his wife were conspiring to get him to pitch to age 50. "I was laughing at it," he said. "Now it's starting to scare me."

HEADLINE: Where Green Trumps Black and White;
In Harlem's Business Boom, Victors and Victims Come in All Races

BYLINE: By AMY WALDMAN

 BODY:
First the rent on Desmond Parkin's optometry business on 125th Street in Harlem went "through the roof." Then a Sterling Optical store moved in across the street. Dr. Parkin, 36, had thought he would retire in Harlem. Instead, unable to compete, he decamped for Brooklyn, abandoning his old space to a Starbucks coffee shop.
In the fate of Dr. Parkin, who is black, would seem to be inscribed all of Harlem's worst fears about the remarkable economic development along 125th Street: that small black businesses will be crushed by an avalanche of outside (read white) capital trolling for profit, and by landlords looking to capitalize on it. 
 It is a neat narrative, but not entirely accurate. For the Sterling Optical store is wholly black-owned. A partnership between six young black men and the Abyssinian Development Corporation, a Harlem-based, black-run community development organization, was able to buy the franchise and set up shop with a loan from Bankers Trust and the Local Initiatives Support Corporation.
And that set of facts reflects a larger truth. On the new 125th Street -- essentially the stretch between Fifth Avenue and Frederick Douglass Boulevard -- the victors in business are all races, and so are the victims. While many small black-owned businesses are being imperiled by competition from national retailers and especially by rising rents, one color trumps both black and white in the neighborhood these days, and that is green.
"People are doing business," Barbara Askins, president and chief executive of the 125th Street Business Improvement District, said succinctly.
Just ask Hojae Lee, who had a sale sign in the window of his All Seasons Shoes store recently and a bitter tinge in his voice. His rent, he said, was being more than doubled by his landlord, and that left him no choice but to move.
"We're getting kicked out," Mr. Lee, who is Asian-American, said. "We're here 20 years and we're getting kicked out."
The engine powering much of this ferment is the grandiose structure rapidly rising at the corner of 125th Street and Frederick Douglass Boulevard. It is Harlem U.S.A., a new shopping center that has lured tenants like Old Navy and Disney who will pay up to $100 a square foot.
Like a metronome, Harlem U.S.A. is setting the street's new pace, and it is a mercilessly fast one. Rents -- particularly those close to the development -- are reaching $75 to $80 a square foot, double what spaces farther east go for, and more than double the top rent on the street five years ago.
"I remember that location being an empty, vacant lot," said Assemblyman Keith Wright, who is the fifth generation of his family to live in Harlem. "To see that large an edifice being built shows progress, shows movement." And, he added, "Any time you have improvements in a neighborhood it's going to increase property values."
As of yet, the center, whose stores will begin opening early next year, has not a single tenant from Harlem. But it, too, defies the easy characterization of black versus white, insider versus outsider. One of the entities poised to profit most heavily from it is a black-run, Harlem-based community development organization, the Harlem Commonwealth Council, which owned the land and co-developed the project.
Community-based or not, such power brokers are not entirely immune to whatever resentment may be bubbling along the street. Rose Rammal, the African-American proprietor of Apollo Express, which sells high-priced labels like Gianfranco Ferre and Dolce & Gabanna, said a black official from the Harlem Commonwealth Council told her she could open a store in Harlem U.S.A. only if she got Fendi, one of her suppliers, to co-sign the lease for her.
"What an insult," she said. "He didn't even search my assets. He just looked at me, black to black. That's crazy."
Harlem Commonwealth Council referred all calls to Drew Greenwald, the developer of Harlem U.S.A. "We're talking to anyone that wants to have space," Mr. Greenwald said, adding that "local tenants are cut a lot more slack than national ones are."
There is no question, however, that the metaphoric bubble swelling over Harlem is largely due to Harlem U.S.A., and it is equally true that the bubble could burst once the center opens. No one knows, for example, whether Harlemites have the disposable income or appetite to make Disney's cash registers sing, or to make the New York Sports Club's treadmills run. No one knows whether the lack of parking for a 275,000-square-foot-mall will deter consumers.
Mr. Wright, who represents central and west Harlem, estimates the median income in his district at $15,000 to $17,000; 40 percent of his constituents receive public assistance. And if the center does not do well, other retailers clamoring for space on the street could pull back.
But until then, landlords, brokers and developers are riding the wave. There is a land rush under way on the street. Some landlords are putting small tenants on month-to-month notice in the hope of trading up to a bigger fish.
Downtown brokers who never paid Harlem mind are suddenly interested, said Eugene Giscombe, whose company owns, manages and leases property on the street. Real estate owners are buying property, any piece of property, without a tenant in sight.
"They're starting to speculate now," Mr. Giscombe said.
There are so many chain stores seeking space on the street that some are looking east of Fifth Avenue. If the demand continues, Mr. Giscombe said, construction will begin on the street, as developers buy and assemble smaller spaces.
"I think it's going to be great for landlords over time," he said.
Whether it will be great for tenants is another story. "Everyone who's been here awhile is sitting on pins and needles," said John Baynes, who has run Theresa Fashions, a small, fusty boutique selling formal wear, for more than 30 years.
For some longtime business owners, the rise of the street may signal the end of the line. William Smith, who has owned Bill's Hardware and Paints at 1 West 125th Street for more than 22 years, said he was already being hurt by the Home Depot in the Bronx. Next year, another Home Depot is scheduled to be built at 125th and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, formerly the site of the Washburn Wire Factory.
"I'm hoping to God I'll be able to sell before then," Mr. Smith, who is African-American, said.
For others, it is the beginning of opportunity. Leon Ellis, a young black entrepreneur, moved his store, Harlem Underground, to Fifth Avenue, just off 125th Street, this year. It has since been doing a business as steady as the embroidery machine whirring away at the front of the store, stitching personalized logos onto T-shirts and hats.
And even some of those who are apprehensive are finding that there are benefits to large competitors: more traffic on the street.
"It means the opportunity for greater customer participation without direct advertisement," said Robert Rencher, the owner of Rencher's Crab Inn, which has been on the street for 10 years.
But what is crushing Mr. Rencher, and many other small businesses, is rent. His is up to $6,800 a month. Some will survive if their landlords do not raise rents as much as they could, of if they renegotiated their leases before rents shot up. Then there is Walter Douglas, of Puppy's, a man whose personality is considerably larger than his tiny store. He has sold clothing to Harlemites for 27 years.
"He supplies Harlem with leathers," often on layaway, said Ms. Askins, of the 125th Street Business Improvement District.
And so Mr. Douglas can afford to welcome Harlem U.S.A., saying, "It's showing people living here that we have the same opportunities as everyone else."
That Mr. Douglas greets every friend who walks by his store, and sizes up every stranger, is a reminder that Harlem still retains the feel of a small town, with 125th Street as its Main Street, on which acquaintances greet each other.
Businesses that fail to try to make a connection with the neighborhood are struggling, Ms. Askins said. "You can't just put something there -- you need to connect with the people," she added.
Old or new, many believe, if few will say on the record, that the loss of middling businesses and bodegas will be no loss for the street. And it may be the rest of Harlem's gain, as smaller businesses fan out to other streets.
But no matter what, change is coming -- as much in the character of the stores as their size. The small stores that served an older, loyal clientele, and embody a different era, are now shoulder to shoulder with stores pursuing a fickle youth market.
Harlem businesses increasingly see urban culture as a possible export. The owners of Dr. Jays, which sells urban street wear, now have three stores on the street, including Harlem N.Y.C., a two-story, 35,000-square-foot store.
Louis Falcon, the manager of Harlem Scheme, a store that sells urban wear to a hip-hop soundtrack, said the store owners came to 125th Street to capitalize on Harlem U.S.A., which is across the street. If you are trying to buy authenticity, their message is, there is nowhere better to buy than Harlem.
Mr. Baynes, the owner of Theresa Fashions, remembers when women on 125th wore gloves and hats, and stores closed on Sundays "It's more like a hip-hop generation street now," he said. "I'm not too pleased with that."

HEADLINE: Clinton Goes 'Home' to Arkansas, Talking Like a Former President

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WEST MEMPHIS, Ark., Dec. 10

 BODY:
President Clinton still has more than 13 months left in office, but he was clearly focusing on his future after the White House today as he made a nostalgic homecoming trip to his native state.
Mr. Clinton sounded more like a governor than a president as he spoke to the Greater Little Rock Chamber of Commerce and toured depressed areas of eastern Arkansas, announcing millions of dollars in federal grants to promote economic development, train long-haul truck drivers and improve local health care services. 
 "Let me just take a minute to walk back through memory lane," Mr. Clinton said in a mellow, wistful speech to the chamber of commerce.
The whole day followed that pattern as Mr. Clinton thanked the people he credited with making possible his career in national politics.
"I want to begin by thanking the people of Arkansas, who gave me the chance to serve for a dozen years as governor, without which I could never have become president," he said.
He observed that his days in the White House were winding down, and he emphasized this theme so much that it sounded as if his term would end next month, rather than in January 2001.
Mr. Clinton had little to say about his plans for the remainder of his term. Rather, he boasted of his achievements over the last seven years and described -- in more detail than ever before -- his vision of life after the White House, including his plan to build a presidential library in Little Rock, on a 26-acre site beside the Arkansas River.
Mr. Clinton said the library would not only burnish his record but also attract visitors to Little Rock from all over the world.
"I want this to be a museum, but not a mausoleum," Mr. Clinton said.
He said his presidential archives would be combined with a policy center, where he intends to continue the projects he began as president. He said nothing about the home he and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, bought in Chappaqua, N.Y., or the career she seeks as a United States senator from New York.
Leaders of the chamber of commerce used Mr. Clinton's visit as an occasion to encourage donations to the foundation that is building the library. They said they were trying to raise $125 million.
Mr. Clinton said he would continue his work mediating racial, ethnic, political and religious conflicts after he left the White House.

HEADLINE: No Accord on Island Bombing as Administration and Puerto Rico Point Fingers

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 10

 BODY:
Hopes for settling the dispute over bombing exercises on the island of Vieques appeared to dwindle today, as senior administration officials and the governor of Puerto Rico differed over whether they had actually agreed on the future of a bombing range there and, if so, what exactly they had agreed to.
White House and Pentagon officials complained that the governor had reneged on a promise to endorse President Clinton's proposals, while the governor said the president had announced a plan that did not reflect the actual negotiations with Puerto Rican officials. 
 Mr. Clinton's compromise plan, recommended by Defense Secretary William S. Cohen, rejected an earlier Navy recommendation to continue live-fire exercises on Vieques and accepted a Puerto Rican demand to halt the use of explosives.
The plan also delayed several major decisions on the Navy's future role in Vieques while the Navy and the Puerto Rican governor discussed whether the military could resume exercises in March with ordnance containing no explosives.
As part of the package, the Navy offered the island $40 million in economic revival money to show that it understands it must "repair relations" with the people of Vieques.
But just hours after the deal was announced last week by senior military and civilian Navy Department officials, Gov. Pedro J. Rossello publicly rejected the offer.
Stunned, the Pentagon has now postponed several aspects of the proposal and is discussing moves that could have a serious economic impact on Puerto Rico.
"The White House was surprised by the rejection," a senior administration official said. "We had been led to believe that the governor would endorse this."
Mr. Cohen said he had crafted the compromise with the Navy and Marines in recent weeks and was working under the assumption that the White House had negotiated an agreement with Governor Rossello.
"The White House told us they believed the governor would accept this," Mr. Cohen said in an interview. "So, yes, I was surprised when the governor did not support the agreement."
Through a spokesman, Governor Rossello said that Mr. Cohen misunderstood what had happened.
"It was the other way around," said Alfonso Aguilar, the governor's spokesman. "The president's plan did not reflect what the governor had agreed to. We were surprised and disappointed."
Only President Clinton and several of his senior aides spoke directly to Governor Rossello. Mr. Clinton stepped into the negotiations on Veteran's Day and spoke to the governor at least three times before the proposal was announced last week.
Governor Rossello believed that the president had agreed that the plan would include legally binding commitments that the bombing on the island would end and the Navy would leave, his spokesman said.
Several defense officials said today that they believed the confusion was the fault of politics.
The Vieques issue has brought a rare unity among the people of Puerto Rico, who in turn have put it on the national political agenda. Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is running for senator from New York State, which has a large Puerto Rican population, has sided with Puerto Rico against the Navy. So has Vice President Al Gore, whose presidential campaign co-chairman in Puerto Rico is Governor Rossello.
But the White House said it, too, was chagrined.
"None of us was thrilled about where we ended up on Friday," the senior administration official said.
Governor Rossello will negotiate only with the president and his senior aides in discussions on Vieques, and not with the Navy, his spokesman said today, adding that the governor expected the president to reconsider the plan.
"We are only dealing with the policy makers," Mr. Aguilar said. "The Navy should understand its role in these things. The commander in chief is the policy maker, and the Navy takes orders from President Clinton."
The Navy has postponed sending Rear Adm. Kevin Green to San Juan as the special representative for Vieques, even though the admiral's wife had already arrived there.
And the senior administration official said today that without a "very good sense of whether these talks will go forward in the next several weeks," the military would reconsider its entire relationship with Puerto Rico.
The territory is also home to Roosevelt Roads, one of the Navy's largest bases and one of Puerto Rico's largest employers.
At the same time, Pentagon officials, the White House and the governor said they wanted to continue looking for some way to bring the sides together to resume discussions.
The negotiations are complicated by the presence of hundreds of demonstrators camping on the Vieques firing range who refuse to leave for fear that the Navy will return. The range has been closed since a civilian Puerto Rican guard was killed after Marine jets dropped bombs that unintentionally hit an observation tower last spring.
That death galvanized Puerto Rican complaints against the Navy's use of the 900-acre range on Vieques. The small island has high unemployment; its residents have suffered health problems, including a high incidence of cancer, and the island's coral reef and wildlife have been threatened by the bombing.
For his part, Mr. Cohen said last week's proposal was the best the Pentagon could offer. The loss of Vieques would mean the end of all coordinated live-fire exercises on the east coast for the Navy.

HEADLINE: Is There Too Much Venture Capital?

BYLINE: By Charles Ferguson; Charles Ferguson is the author of "High Stakes, No Prisoners: A Winner's Tale of the Internet Wars."

 BODY:
Isubscribe to VentureWire, an e-mail newsletter that summarizes new venture capital investments in Internet companies. An average issue lists about 20 deals, usually adding up to between $100 million and $200 million. What's striking is that VentureWire comes daily -- and yet doesn't catch everything. Driven largely by optimism about the Internet, investment in American technology start-ups will probably reach approximately $50 billion for this year -- about 10 times more than in 1994.
This eagerness to invest in the latest start-up is, of course, another aspect of the same rush of capital that we are seeing when high-technology companies go public. On Thursday, the stock of VA Linux Systems had the biggest first-day gain for any initial public offering in history. This company, which sells computers that run the Linux operating system, faces serious competitors like I.B.M. and Dell, is losing money and will not turn a profit for the foreseeable future. Yet it was valued at almost $10 billion by the end of the day -- a gain of 733 percent. 
 But high-technology start-ups are not just stocks; They are also businesses, and they have to operate. The giddiness about stock prices is obscuring the real needs of companies.
It didn't used to be this way -- in fact, we used to have the opposite problem. Until very recently, the venture capital industry was a small club, verging on a cartel, and the technology sector was for geeks in California, period. Money was tight, particularly during the technology sector recession in the early 1990's.
In 1994, I spent five brutal months raising $4 million for my first company, an early Internet software start-up. At the time, there were maybe a thousand Web sites in the world.
But since the onset of the commercial Internet revolution in 1995, money has flooded into the Internet, with the size of the venture capital industry roughly doubling every year. A very real revolution -- the growth of the Internet -- is being accompanied, and sometimes damaged, by an epidemic of speculation.
Fund-raising has become a buyer's market. Venture capitalists now must compete for deals, despite their vastly increased funds and the large number of Internet companies being started.
In many ways, this is good. It is now much easier for entrepeneurs to raise money. I recently founded my second Internet start-up. This time, I raised over $3 million in the first month.
The Internet has also made business life a lot fairer. You don't have to stay in a big, bureaucratic company anymore; you can join a start-up. You can bypass middlemen and sell directly to the global market. And without a doubt, the Internet wouldn't have come so far so fast if venture funding still behaved as it did a decade ago.
But the fact that virtually any idea -- no matter how dubious -- can obtain money, and that so much money is available, is also causing problems. Competition among Internet companies is increasingly a financial arms race. They must raise huge war chests, give away their products, advertise on television, and pay insanely high salaries -- simply because their competitors do.
The glut of money also has companies -- and the industry as a whole -- growing insanely fast, leading to labor shortages everywhere -- of not only engineers and managers, but graphic designers, accountants, headhunters, telephone system installers.
Fortune seekers, many of them unqualified, flood to the Internet -- both to start companies and to work in them. This leads to sloppy work and some fairly sleazy behavior.
In some respects, the rush and confusion are natural costs of moving forward as a major new technology becomes widely available. Relative to the benefits that the Internet brings, these problems are comparatively minor. But the inherent dangers of a speculative environment will eventually hurt many naive investors -- and perhaps, more importantly, they also make life more difficult for serious entrepeneurs.

THE SOCIAL CONSTRUCTION OF WHAT?
 By Ian Hacking.
 261 pp. Cambridge, Mass.:
 Harvard University Press. $29.95. 
 I AM writing this review in the Reading Room of the London Library. Both are reflections of society. Each concept has a history, an evolving social function. Reviewing books is roughly contemporaneous with the rise of literary and academic periodicals around 1700, though literary criticism is at least as old as Aristotle. Likewise, libraries go back to ancient royal or ecclesiastical collections, but are transformed by the spread of literacy and printing. The purpose of the library of Assurbanipal at Nineveh had little in common with that of Thomas Carlyle's brainchild in St. James's Square, in which I sit, and neither had quite the same uses as virtual libraries in cyberspace.
The library and the book review are social phenomena, but are they "social constructions"? Would it add to our knowledge to be told, say, that many readers of The New York Times Book Review are so busy they often rely on reviews in case they find themselves next to a well-read acquaintance at a dinner party? If that were true, would it "unmask" the review (or the Review) as untrue to its purpose? Is it not the case that people have always read reviews for a variety of reasons, including to learn which books they do not need to read, and to build conversational self-confidence? And is there not more continuity than the notion of social construction suggests? Wouldn't guests at Plato's Symposium have welcomed an Athenian Times Book Review?
"The Social Construction of the Book Review" would be no more zany a title than the A-to-Z of real books in the genre compiled by Ian Hacking in "The Social Construction of What?" Social construction is an all-purpose method of relativizing any object of criticism. Social and natural scientists, no less than philosophers, have a stake in it, especially after the "science wars" of recent years; so, too, do nonacademics, for the rhetoric of social construction has crept into debates about race, feminism and environmentalism and into every kind of political discourse.
Hacking is a Canadian philosopher of science, with important studies of probability and psychology to his name. He is no less at home in Continental philosophy and social theory than in the Anglo-Saxon tradition. His ability to leap with enviable facility from one to the other qualifies him well to bring some order into this intellectual quagmire. "The Social Construction of What?" is a collection of papers, not a systematic treatment, but it hangs together. Hacking starts out by defining the common claims of social constructionists: that X in its present form was not inevitable, that X is bad and that X should be abolished or at least reformed. He looks at how constructionists apply these levels of criticism, ranging from the mere historicizing of gender, race, the economy or the self through an ironical disillusionment to unmasking or revolution. He distinguishes between interactive constructions, such as "women refugees" who create themselves by reacting to their situation, and indifferent or inanimate kinds that are constructed by others, such as scientists.
He argues that the metaphor of social construction suffers from overuse. "Social" is often redundant, while the uses of the metaphor of construction in philosophy by Kant, Bertrand Russell, Rudolf Carnap, Nelson Goodman and Thomas Kuhn, while valid, have little to do with its usage among today's theorists. While earlier philosophers were allies of the natural sciences, modern constructionists set out to subvert them. Thus, Andrew Pickering claims quarks would not have been discovered (he would say constructed) but for contingent factors connected with the political status of high-energy physics. Hacking devotes a chapter to weapons research and finds guilty of "ideological paranoia" those theorists who invalidate its results merely on account of its motives or funding.
When Alan Sokal famously sought to discredit theorists by publishing a spoof article of antiscience in the journal Social Text, he was seeking to reclaim the territory of the left for scientists, whom social constructionists tend to stereotype as navely conservative. Hacking has sympathy with both sides but is uncomfortable with social construction as an explanatory tool.
Since Foucault, madness has been a favorite, if moving, target. Hacking looks at attempts to unmask retardation, autism and schizophrenia as social constructions rather than biological disorders, tracing the conceptual evolution of these pathologies. He concludes that with the help of semantic distinctions formulated long ago by the philosophers Hilary Putnam and Saul Kripke, the debate is probably unnecessary and certainly irrelevant to research into genetic and neurological factors in psychopathology.
In short, if it were to become the dominant hermeneutic method in the world of laboratories and hospitals, social construction might amount to scientific destruction. But how about a case like child abuse? Hacking examines the complex dialectic between reality and concept: definitions of abuse mutate as behavior is modified to accommodate growing public anxiety. Hence our view of the past alters, too: "pedophile" seems inadequate to describe the 15th-century fiend Gilles de Rais, who tortured and murdered children to satisfy his lust; but is it not too pejorative for Lewis Carroll, who did not lay a finger on the little girls he photographed? Medical terms like "battered child syndrome" are created; ramifications for the legal system are endless. Even after Hacking's tour d'horizon, however, we still do not know whether child abuse is usefully described as socially constructed or not.
Hacking concludes with a witty piece about why the Hawaiians killed Captain Cook. This hinges on the question of whether they saw the explorer as a god or merely a chief. Hacking attempts to adjudicate between two anthropological perspectives: that of Marshall Sahlins, who sees the English and Hawaiian versions of events as essentially accurate and compatible, and that of Gananath Obeyesekere, who sees the "apotheosis" of Cook as socially constructed by the English. Sahlins thinks Cook fitted into Hawaiian mythology, while Obeyesekere denies that any colonial peoples saw Europeans as gods. Hacking is a shrewd critic of incoherence, and he finds the ethnographic data inconsistent with Obeyesekere's attribution to the Hawaiians of a "pragmatic rationality" that sounds suspiciously Western. Social construction makes for lively polemics, but does not add much to our knowledge. It is not enough merely to be subversive.

EMPIRE EXPRESS
 Building the First
 Transcontinental Railroad.
 By David Haward Bain.
 Illustrated. 797 pp. New York:
 Viking. $34.95. 
 ON May 10, 1869, a self-important and somewhat boozy array of frock-coated dignitaries gathered with several hundred rowdy laborers to drive the last spike in the Pacific Railroad. The site was Promontory Summit, Utah (not Promontory Point, 30 miles to the south). The last spike was an ordinary iron spike (not a "golden" spike, which would have been crushed by a sledgehammer's blow). The Central Pacific's Leland Stanford and the Union Pacific's Thomas C. Durant are both said to have swung at the spike and missed, to the great delight of the crowd, but David Haward Bain demolishes this oft-told tale. When the sledgehammers connected, an attached telegraph wire sped the impulse east and west to set off joyous celebration everywhere.
The last spike completed the union of Atlantic and Pacific by rail. The ceremony crowned one of the most dramatic and significant episodes in American history. Passengers and freight could now cross the continent in days instead of months. Settlement, commerce, industry, agriculture and other railroads spread north and south from the twin bands of iron. The Indians' remaining years of freedom dwindled to less than a decade. The United States became a nation not only in cartographic fact but in social, political and economic fact as well.
The building of the Pacific railroad is an epic story, often recounted but never so thoroughly, authoritatively and engagingly as in "Empire Express." The story unfolds along two trajectories, each with its own cast of well-etched characters, each a drama of conflict, adventure, excitement and suspense. The one reverberates through corporate boardrooms, federal and state offices, the cloakrooms of Congress and the courts; the other in the towering Sierra Nevada, the deserts of Utah and Nevada, the rugged canyons of Utah's Wasatch and the Nebraska plains. The Central Pacific raced east, the Union Pacific west, to the meeting that only at the last moment turned out to be Promontory. Bain, the author of "Sitting in Darkness: Americans in the Philippines," traces both trajectories with clarity and engaging narrative, and he is skilled in relating each to the other, for each enormously influenced the other.
No novelist could have created a more vibrant set of characters than those who built the Pacific railroad. The Central Pacific boasted the California-based Big Four -- Leland Stanford, Collis P. Huntington, Mark Hopkins and Charles Crocker. Bain rightly expands this to a Big Five by including the hitherto unappreciated role of Crocker's brother Edwin. Charles bossed the construction gangs. Hopkins kept the books. Huntington played the Washington and New York scene, dispensing lavish sums in cash, stock and bonds to buy the favor of the federal officials and members of Congress on whom federal subsidies and land grants depended. Back home, Edwin Crocker furnished the vital communications link between Huntington in the east and the others in California. Lazy and comfort-loving, Stanford did only what the others pushed him to do.
In contrast to the tight-knit but internally quarrelsome Big Five, the Union Pacific suffered from a sprawling cast of openly warring characters and factions. Many corporate moguls circulated in and out of the railroad's ornate Manhattan headquarters. But the Darth Vader of them all was Thomas C. Durant, unsurpassed master of chicanery, avarice and manipulation of corporate power for personal enrichment. In the field, Grenville Dodge, Jack and Dan Casement and Samuel Reed pushed surveyors, graders and trackers across plains and mountains, but not without the infuriating interference of Durant and his toadies, whose changes of alignment produced more curves and therefore more mileage and therefore more government subsidies.
Even by the loose standards of the 1860's, every ranking official of both railroads could be labeled a crook, as most ultimately were. Bain probes the financial, legal and political skulduggery in all its complexity. He nimbly spins the kaleidoscope of stocks, bonds, securities, first and second mortgages, slush funds and piles of cash. He exposes the artifice of the Credit Mobilier and the Contract and Finance Company, by which the railroad directors let padded construction contracts to themselves. Bain's attempt to untangle the tangle is sometimes bewildering but always fascinating.
Everyone, it seems, got rich, some fabulously rich, while the companies plummeted into debt and finally bankruptcy. High government officials in Washington profited, including the vice president and a string of congressional committee chieftains who found themselves badly embarrassed when the scandal poured forth three years after the celebration at Promontory. Construction suffered, less so on the Central Pacific than the Union Pacific, whose line from Omaha to Promontory was so shoddily built that it had to be almost entirely redone at once. Field supervisors and contractors also found ways to plunder the company coffers. Even Grenville Dodge, who usually emerges as the lone untarnished hero, gets caught with his hand in the till -- not only the Union Pacific's till, but afterward in Indian supply contracts and in building the Texas and Pacific Railway.
More compelling and more readily understood than the corporate swindling is the construction story, an epic matched by few in American history. The Central Pacific's conquest of the California Sierras was a marvel of engineering and labor. The visionary Theodore Judah laid the engineering groundwork, but Samuel Montague and Lewis Clement carried it over (and through) the great granite peaks, across the Donner Pass and down the Truckee Canyon.
The true heroes of the summit crossing, however, were the thousands of docile, obedient, hard-working Chinese laborers Crocker imported from Canton. With primitive equipment, they shaped the grades, raised the trestles, blasted the cuts and tunnels with black powder, shoveled in the fills, laid and spiked the rails and built mile after mile of sheds to guard the line from huge drifts of winter snow and avalanches that could wipe out miles of track. They even lowered themselves down cliffs in wicker baskets, woven on patterns remembered from their homeland, and worked with a volatile new compound called nitroglycerine, without which the great summit tunnel could not have been completed for years. Their graves dotted trackside in mountain and desert, memorials to a people destined for brutal ethnic prejudice in their adopted land.
Pushing west from Omaha, Dodge and Casement, recently Union generals, commanded their Irish workmen, recently Union soldiers, as if still on the battlefield. They were muscular exemplars of labor, but, in contrast to the Chinese, unruly and given to incapacitating binges at the "Hell on Wheels" that leaped west from one end of the track to the next. The Union Pacific faced no such daunting obstacle as the Sierras but had its share of mountain work in the Laramie and Wasatch ranges.
With both sides striving for the maximum in federal subsidies and land grants (as well as markets), surveyors and graders worked far in advance of the end of track. For miles in Utah and Nevada, surveyor stakes and grades ran parallel until a point of union could be agreed and ratified by Congress. Bleak, treeless Promontory Summit was at last fixed, with the Central Pacific to take over the Union Pacific work back down to Ogden, gateway to the Salt Lake Valley.
Today, at the Golden Spike National Historic Site, visitors may view parallel grades, cuts, fills and trestle footings, fruits of the great railroad race that finally ended at Promontory Summit. Ironically, these impressive works, snaking side by side up the rocky eastern face of the Promontory Mountains, were not the product of the legendary Irish and Chinese laborers but of pious Mormons. The church's president, Brigham Young, had arranged for Mormon bishops to mobilize labor gangs and dip into the barrel from which everyone else seemed to be imbibing so freely. Bankrupted by the frenzy of fraud, neither company ever paid the Mormons.
"Empire Express" is well researched, well written, refreshingly revisionist where the sources indicate, illustrated by well-chosen photographs and studded with beautiful topographical maps indispensable to the construction story. The book promises to endure as the standard history of the Pacific railroad.

STIRRINGS IN THE JUG
 Black Politics in the
 Post-Segregation Era.
 By Adolph Reed Jr.
 University of Minnesota,
 cloth, $47.95; paper, $18.95. 
 Forcefully ringing changes on a remark by Ralph Ellison -- that segregation was wrongly seen as "an opaque steel jug with the Negroes inside waiting for some black messiah" -- Adolph Reed Jr. uses these essays to examine where black leadership has failed and where black action may yet succeed. In urban politics, Reed argues, black candidates' need for the white swing vote, combined with the clamor for jobs and growth, inexorably means white leverage over black aspirations; thus Atlanta-based Delta Airlines became a kingmaking force among Atlanta's black elite, and the National Conference of Black Mayors echoed Ronald Reagan's call for ghetto "enterprise zones." Reed, who teaches political science at the New School for Social Research, damns the idea that black Americans "hold a status similar to a protectorate," to be managed by favoring self-appointed spokesmen, and skewers those who have sought white endorsement as "national black leader." Reed rejects the conventional assumption that poor black people are to blame for all their own problems. "I do not want to hear another word about drug or crime," he concludes, "without hearing about decent jobs, adequate housing and egalitarian education in the same breath." Allen D. Boyer

HEADLINE: Food;
All the Cookies

BYLINE: By Molly O'Neill

 BODY:
Over the years Ethel Carlegren has acquired about 500 Santa Claus figures, some made out of porcelain, others made from wood, wool or clay. She has also collected at least 10 recipes for Swedish Christmas cookies. Still, you will not catch her decorating her Minnesota home anytime before Dec. 13.
"I am Swedish, you see," says Carlegren, 54, who immigrated with her husband, Anders, to Bloomington, a suburb just 10 miles south of downtown Minneapolis, 18 years ago. "First we cook, then we buy presents and finally we decorate." 
 Even though she has reared her two children here, she believes that she has grown more Swedish with each passing year. "Or perhaps just older," she says. "As you get older you begin to appreciate the past." In any case, she has no plans to follow the American custom of decorating right after Thanksgiving and baking the day before Christmas.
Her choice of Dec. 13, on St. Lucia's Day, is actually a compromise to please her daughter, Viktoria. "Ja, my daughter is 15, and she wants the decorations on American time," explains Carlegren, "so I bend a little."
However, it's not clear -- at least to her -- which affects her more: accommodating her adopted home or adapting to changing times. Is it, for instance, the pace of living in modern America that is suddenly propelling her to start baking Christmas cookies the day after Thanksgiving? Or is it because she has a large freezer where she can store her dough? Or is it that there are now high-quality gingerbread kits available in Sweden, where the family spends its summers, and she no longer needs to make her holiday cookie houses from scratch?
Carlegren isn't sure of the answer. "We change in ways we don't notice," she says. And then one day, she realizes, she isn't making Swedish meatballs as often as she used to.
"Some things just slip away," observes Carlegren, the founder of the local chapter of the Swedish Women's Educational Association International, an organization dedicated to preserving the Swedish language and customs. The sum of the changes is simply what is called being Swedish in America.
But around the holidays, subtle shifts seem more dramatic. Carlegren's children, for instance, worry when each of the 500 Santa Claus figures, or tomtar, from their mother's collection is not in the precise spot it occupied last year -and the year before that.
Truth be told, says Carlegren, her kids have never developed much of a taste for Christmas cookies. "The children are so American," she says. "They like salty snacks, not so much sweet cookies." Still, each has his or her favorite. Her daughter prefers gingerbread snaps; her son, Frederik, 25, the saffron buns.
Whatever else changes, the cookies themselves do not. Their flavor always evokes the smell of caramelizing sugar, butter and flour, and the Carlegrens' kitchen forever remains a pathway back to a land that formed these confections long before Viktoria and Frederik were born.
To them, a single unchanged cookie is the one true thing. To their mother, such economy is virtually unfathomable. "I must bake my 10 kinds of cookies and all the saffron breads and buns," she says. "I try to push my children to eat the cookies, but perhaps when they are older, they will have more of a taste for them."
 
Skurna Chokladbrod (Cut Chocolate Cookies)
 
 1 cup butter
 3/4 cup sugar
 1 egg
 2 cups flour
 3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
 1 teaspoon baking soda
 1 tablespoon vanilla sugar
 1 beaten egg for brushing cookies Pearl sugar for garnish.
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar. Add the egg and mix thoroughly. Sift together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and vanilla sugar. Stir the flour mixture into the butter-and-sugar mixture, stirring until the ingredients are just combined.
2. Divide the dough into 6 equal balls and roll each out to a log about 3/4-inch thick. Place the logs, well spaced, on greased sheet pans. Brush each with the beaten egg and sprinkle generously with pearl sugar. Bake until they just begin to darken and crack on top, yet are still soft, 15 to 20 minutes.
3. Remove from the oven and cool slightly. Remove from the sheet pans and place on a cutting board. While the cookies are still warm, use a sharp knife to cut the logs on the bias into 1-inch-wide strips. Cut again on the bias to form small diamonds.
Yield: About 60 cookies.
 
Kalasstanger (Holiday Almond Fingers)
 
 1 cup butter
 1/3 cup sugar
 1 large egg yolk
 Grated zest from half a lemon
 2 cups flour
 1 7-ounce tube almond paste
 1 large egg white
 1 egg, lightly beaten
 1/3 cup sliced almonds.
1. In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar. Beat in the egg yolk and lemon zest. Stir in the flour until just combined. Gather the dough into a ball, wrap in plastic and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Grate the almond paste and mix it with the egg white. Refrigerate.
2. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. On a lightly floured surface, roll the chilled dough out until it is very thin (about 1/8inch) and use a sharp knife to cut it into 3-inch squares. Spread the almond-paste mixture over the squares. Roll the squares up as if you were rolling up a carpet. Place the cookies on a greased cookie sheet. Rework the scraps until all the dough is used. Brush each with the beaten egg and sprinkle with almond slices. Bake until the cookies are lightly brown, about 15 minutes. Remove from the hot pan and place on a cool sheet pan.
Yield: About 24 cookies.
 
Spritskransar
(Spritz Cookies)
 
 14 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature
 1/4 cup sugar
 1 egg yolk

 2/3 cup heavy cream.
1. Place the syrup in a small pan and place over medium heat until it is very hot but not boiling. Place the sugar in a large bowl. Pour the hot syrup over the sugar and beat until the sugar crystals dissolve, about 10 minutes. Beat in the butter, then the cinnamon, ginger, cloves and salt. Sift together the baking soda and 2 cups of the flour and stir it into the dough. Stir in the heavy cream. Add the remaining 2 cups of flour, stirring until just combined. Wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate for at least a day and up to 1 week.
2. When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 350 degrees. On a lightly floured surface using a floured rolling pin, roll out half the dough to a thickness of 1/8inch. Using cookie cutters, cut the dough out. Use a spatula to transfer the cookies to greased baking sheets. Bake until the edges just barely begin to brown, about 5 to 6 minutes. Cool briefly on the pan and transfer to a cool sheet pan.
Yield: About 100 cookies.
 
Lussekatter Med Saffran
(Lucia Buns With Saffron)
 
 1 cup butter
 1 cup margarine
 1 2/3 cups milk
 1 2-ounce cake of compressed fresh yeast, or 3 1/4-ounce packages dry yeast
1 large egg
 1 1/2 cups sugar
 1 teaspoon salt
 1 teaspoon ground cardamom
 3/4 teaspoon crushed saffron threads
 6 1/2 cups flour
 1 large egg lightly beaten for brushing Raisins for garnish.
1. Melt the butter and margarine over low heat. Pour in the milk and continue to heat until the milk is warm but not hot. (It should seem to be just about at body temperature.) Transfer to a large bowl and stir in the yeast. Add the egg, sugar, salt, cardamom and saffron. Stir in the flour until a smooth dough forms. Cover with a tea towel and let rise in a warm place until it is doubled in volume, about 60 minutes.
2. Punch the dough down. Divide into 5 equal pieces. Take each piece and roll it out into a snake about a foot long. Cut each snake into 8 equal pieces. Roll each piece again into a smaller snake, about 8 inches long, and form each into an "S" shape with the ends coiled in. Place on a greased sheet pan and continue until all the dough is formed. Cover the sheets with tea towels and let rise until the dough is almost doubled in size, about 40 minutes.
3. When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 475 degrees. Brush each bun with egg and place a raisin in each coiled end. Bake for 5 to 8 minutes, until golden brown. Remove from the pan and cool on a wire rack.
Yield: About 40 buns.

Feeding Frenzy

BYLINE: By Michael Pollan; Michael Pollan is a contributing writer for the magazine. He recently received an award from Reuters and the World Conservation Union for "Playing God in the Garden," which appeared here in October 1998.

 BODY:
Gazing nervously across the Atlantic at European outrage over genetically modified food, industry and government leaders have been quick to reach for words like "hysteria" and "madness." How else to explain the uprooting of biotech crops in English fields? Or naked protesters in Rome pelting American cabinet secretaries with genetically engineered ("G.E.") soybeans? It's irrational, surely, to reject out of hand such a shiny new technology, especially one that comes with the seal of approval of American regulators (the vaunted Food and Drug Administration, no less).
Stylistically, too, the European protests seem so old. There they go, those Brits, indulging their Luddite fear of the new, actually taking seriously a prince (a prince!) who declares that this technology lacks the sanction of God. And the French! Hopelessly sentimental, urinating in protest on shipments of high-tech seed and nattering on about "culinary dispossession" as if this were 1968. "Europe seems to be gripped right now by a collective madness," Senator Richard Lugar suggested during a visit to Germany last summer. "And we don't want that to spread to the rest of the world." 
 Since then, of course, the "madness" has spread; witness the events in Seattle. In a global economy, protest moves as easily across borders as products.
In recent months, activists dressed as monarch butterflies have popped up in London, Chicago and Washington (as well as Seattle), reminders of a famous recent study at Cornell that found biotech corn may pose a threat to the beloved insect. A cliche of chaos theory holds that the flutter of a butterfly's wing in, say, Timbuktu, can set off a hurricane half a world away. So it was with these butterflies in Ithaca, who moved the biotech story from the business pages to the front pages. For most Americans, it came as news that there were already some 20 million acres of biotech corn planted in the United States. You mean we're already eating this stuff? And how come nobody thought of doing these tests 20 million acres ago?
The wonder is that it has taken so long for the political debate about G.E. food to reach our shores. One theory about why Europeans got so hysterical so quickly about G.E. food is that they lack a trusted regulator like the F.D.A. protecting their food supply. Sounds rational enough, until you discover that the F.D.A.'s "regulation" of biotech is voluntary; companies decide for themselves whether to submit a new biotech food to the agency for review. In other words, the agency's oversight of biotech food has been based less on law and science than on faith.
Last year, the Center for Food Safety, a public-interest group, sued the F.D.A., charging that its 1992 rules covering biotech food were illegal because the agency had failed to seek public comment or conduct a thorough scientific review. The agency's response was alarming: since we have no regulations concerning biotech food, they can't be illegal. Just last month, seven years after first approving G.E. food, the F.D.A. held its first public hearings about it.
The industry and its regulators evidently didn't think we needed to be informed that our entire food supply was about to be transformed. After all, Americans are by now so far removed from the farm that we know remarkably little -- at least compared with the Europeans -- about the processes by which food finds its way to our plates. Food? That comes from the supermarket. So who was going to notice or care if one more high-tech link was quietly added to a food chain already so long and intricate? We are the people who eat Olestra, after all.
Labeling was rejected out of hand -- too cumbersome and too risky. For who, given the choice, would reach for the spuds with the biotech label?
Right there, in the produce section, lurks the question that goes to the heart of what it means to be rational or hysterical about biotech food. What if I approach the matter as rationally as possible and decide which vegetables to buy based on a strict "cost-benefit analysis"? First, I'll need a little information -- a label (which we may yet get: last month a bill was introduced in Congress calling for the labeling of biotech food). Next, I'll need to know what benefits these novel foods offer. According to the industry that makes them, today's biotech crops (like Round-Up Ready soybeans that resist herbicides, and potatoes and corn that produce their own pesticide) offer plenty of advantages to farmers. They acknowledge, however, that the benefits to consumers are negligible. The food is no cheaper, safer or tastier.
Now add to this calculus what we know about the risks. None to my health have been established, but then, no one's looked very long or hard, either. So: probably safe, but no guarantee. As for risks to the environment, several have already been identified -- the threat to butterflies, the prospect of superweeds and superbugs.
The cost-benefit analysis seems clear: I'd have to be crazy to buy this stuff.
The industry realizes that, in its case, an educated consumer is not its best customer, so lately it has adopted a new tack -- suggesting my produce-aisle calculus is shortsighted and selfish. That's because the real benefits of genetically engineered food will be reaped in the future by hungry people in the third world. Some day, "golden rice" will nourish the malnourished and bananas will be re-engineered to deliver vaccines.
The industry, in other words, is asking consumers to do something it has yet to do itself: Forget rational self-interest, and act on faith. Maybe Monsanto and the others are sincere. So bring on the golden rice! And what will they say about this epiphany in the aisles of my supermarket or on Wall Street? A word leaps to mind: hysterical.

How to Bust His Trust

BYLINE: By Max Frankel 

 BODY:
The judicial finding that Microsoft has attained, enjoyed and abused the power of a monopoly reached me at a fortuitous moment. I instantly knew what punishment fit the crime.
Just a few hours earlier, I had been reading about the tycoon known for "his visionary leadership, his courageous persistence, his capacity to think in strategic terms, but also his lust for domination, his messianic self-righteousness and his contempt for those shortsighted mortals who made the mistake of standing in his way." 
 Bill Gates, the visionary predator? No. John D. Rockefeller Sr., the "Titan" of Ron Chernow's splendid biography. The parallels are uncanny. Also instructive.
Each man seized upon a product that would shrink the earth and define a century. Each employed it to amass incomparable personal wealth. What refined oil did for Rockefeller, processed information has done for Gates. Both brilliantly appropriated the creativity of other folks. Both used that control to gobble up competitors and to crush all challengers. And when finally challenged in court, both shamelessly denied the undeniable evidence of their monopolistic ambitions and predatory conduct.
All this coincidental instruction in the behavior of Microsoft and Standard Oil left me wondering whether Americans would ever learn to overcome the fateful flaw in our free-market system: the very greed that makes us economically creative also repeatedly makes us creatively criminal.
But I was also left full of admiration for Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's quick grasp of the world of Windows and ways of the Web. He mastered the intangibles of Bill Gates's vision much sooner than anyone understood old Rockefeller's devilish designs. And the judge's dense, 200-page indictment of Microsoft was devastating enough to evoke Gates's interest in a deal that might yet rescue him from a lifetime of litigation.
I don't know what either Microsoft or the trustbusters of the Justice Department would deem a proper settlement of the case. But I think Judge Jackson should not close the affair until he can reassert an elementary principle of fair commerce: competition can flourish only if the roads to market are equally available to all competitors.
There's no way to test the market value of a dozen eggs if only one farmer owns a wagon to bring them to town. And if every farmer has a wagon, the market still will not work if one of them collects the tolls for use of the road. For foxy old Rockefeller, the road was a pipeline, then a railroad track, from refinery to port, and he conspired to dictate the tolls for all those roads. Inevitably, he not only paid less than any competitor to ship his own oil; in time, he even commanded a rebate -- called a "drawback" -- from the tolls paid by his rivals.
Decades passed before enough Americans understood how they were being cheated and wrote broad antitrust laws that might protect them against similar betrayals of capitalism. Those are the laws that Judge Jackson now strains to enforce on Bill Gates. But he won't succeed until Microsoft is made to choose between running the wagons and owning the road.
In simpler days, this was sometimes called the "common carrier" rule. If you owned the track, you had to convey everybody's freight fairly. If you owned the wire, you had to connect everybody's phone and carry everybody's message. If you owned a movie house, you had to be available for anybody's films. If you owned a cable, you had to carry all television programs. You could be a common carrier or the creator of something to be carried, but not both.
Simple but also quaint. Technology has a way of overtaking ideology and blurring such distinctions. The cable companies learned to make their own TV shows and to discriminate against rivals. Now the cable owners think they can also become phone companies and the phone companies are angling to send television shows to my computer. And all these wired companies are being challenged by gadgets that send messages and pictures invisibly through the air. What's an egg anymore? Who's a road?
Bill Gates thought his virtual monopoly could never be understood in the old physical terms. And if he had not left a telltale trail of e-mail, the Feds might never have made a plausible case against him. But given the evidence from Gates's own computer, Judge Jackson well understood that Microsoft's imperial triumph had been deliberately and probably illegally engineered.
Gates built Windows, a good road to the information market, and then schemed brilliantly to make it practically the only road that PC owners could navigate. Nearly all wagons -- computer programs -- had to fit on his tracks. Gates's own wagons -- the Microsoft programs -- rode free on his Windows highway, and those of his allies were waved onto low-toll express lanes. Rockefeller rebates redux.
Gates had the market effectively cornered until the Internet produced the prospect of an alternate, Window-less turnpike. Microsoft's long-suffering competitors foresaw a chance of bypassing the personal computer and giving people a much simpler machine that would "borrow" the computing power and programs they periodically need via the Internet.
Belatedly aroused, Gates poured all his monopoly power into blunting that threat. He conspired to destroy rival dreamers, like Netscape, so that his Windows would remain the universal gateway to the Internet. But he was found to have rigged contracts and prices -- while plotting to control the Internet -- and the remaining question is how best to bust his trust.
The remedy, now as in Rockefeller's time, is to make the monopolist choose: Windows or wagons? Gates has already said he wants to keep the road; he wants no deal that deprives him of Windows. Very well; then make him sell off his wagons, his Word and Office programs, and fairly share the Windows specs that competing programmers need to run their wagons on his road.
And then, dear federal trustbusters, please take a look at my cable-TV bills.

HEADLINE: Trickle-Down Civil Rights

BYLINE: By George Packer; George Packer is the author of four books, including "Blood of the Liberals," due out next year from Farrar, Strauss & Giroux.

 BODY:
In early August, some of the country's top business executives made a pilgrimage to Chicago and paid homage to the Rev. Jesse Jackson. The occasion was the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition's annual conference, and before an audience of aspiring black businessmen, a panel that included Sanford Weill of Citigroup, Hugh McCall of Bank of America and Jerry Reinsdorf of the Chicago Bulls and White Sox, swore allegiance to multicultural capitalism.
"It makes money sense," the C.E.O.'s chanted, twice, at Jackson's insistence. He shepherded the participants into a circle of prayer. He told them to hold hands, and they held hands. Harold Levy, Citigroup's director of global compliance, clasped the palm of a black managing director of a New York securities firm named Shawn Baldwin. Jackson prayed for access to capital. 
 "Coke, No. 1 employer in Africa," he murmured. "Archer Daniels Midland, No. 1 in Decatur -- that's in America. There are new, untapped markets."
"Amen," everyone said. And suddenly an energy that was not religious broke loose. Hands released each other to reach into pockets and pull out business cards as the room was given over to a frenzy of networking.
That night at a gala dinner, Janice Mathis, Jackson's chief of staff, watched as the mostly black and decidedly upscale crowd of guests arrived. A woman in a sparkling evening dress hurried over to her, exclaiming, "I love your lip rouge!" Mathis turned to me. "You'll see a lot of folks here," she said, "who wouldn't have anything to do with a civil rights organization."
The executives did not end up in Chicago after a sudden group conversion to the ideals of economic justice. According to Jackson, they were acting out of "enlightened self-interest." The less generous explanation is fear. Jackson can still command a national spotlight when he wants to -- as the mostly white school board in Decatur, Ill., discovered last month when Jackson protested the expulsion of six black students after a brawl at a football game. And in 1996, after racist remarks tape-recorded at a Texaco staff meeting came to light, Jackson put pressure on the company to settle a discrimination suit (for $140 million) and to implement an ambitious affirmative-action plan.
Emboldened, Jackson initiated the Wall Street Project the next year. On the premise that the most entrenched divisions in America are no longer based on race but on wealth, or "access to capital," he began a campaign in which the project buys stock in corporations and lobbies C.E.O.'s to open up jobs, contracts, loans and boardrooms to the "locked out." Before long, some of the largest corporations in America were answering his call for expanded minority hiring and investment in minority-owned companies. Big business, it turns out, has been easier for Jackson to move than the Democratic Party, Southern sheriffs or even the Decatur school board.
Yet the success of the Wall Street project has also raised questions about whether Jackson is offering absolution to corporations that continue to inflate executive pay at the expense of the working poor whom he has long championed.
"Obviously it's a troubling question, and I don't have the answer," says the Rev. Al Sharpton, who came of age politically as Jackson's national youth director. "As one who grew up admiring Jackson, there are some painful things for me to deal with."
Anticipating such criticism, Jackson is at pains to counter it. "There's a scripture: 'Fear not their faces,"' he says when I ask if his proximity to power has compromised his spiritual authority. "Right after we spent four days on Wall Street, we spent eight days in Mississippi. Some people can only be one or the other. They don't have the capacity to reconcile."
Jackson clearly still sees himself as a defender of the downtrodden. His protests over the students' expulsion in Decatur have all the trappings of his own civil rights days: he led marches and ensured his own arrest while demonstrators sang "We Shall Overcome." He compares the town's "power structure" to Selma's and Birmingham's, while at the same time saying that race is not central to the case. He relates the students' experience to the harsh sentencing of juvenile offenders, the underfinancing of schools and a general anger toward America's children. "This is a huge issue we have uncovered here," he says.
Yet not everyone sees it as so huge. Many of the black parents in the community agree with the school board's decision. If anything, the smaller if highly publicized causes that Jackson has embraced -- student discipline, the release of the hostages last spring -- have often served to underscore the limitations of protest politics in our time.
Jackson ran for the presidency a decade ago on a platform of economic populism -- uniting hard-pressed farmers, laid-off and low-wage workers and the urban poor, declaring that "capital does not follow conscience and it needs constraints." There had been nothing like his interracial movement of the disenfranchised since Robert Kennedy's 1968 campaign, maybe since the original Populists in the early 1890's.
But through much of the 1990's Jackson seemed to lose touch with the passions of his earlier campaigns -- trying out a career in television, feuding with and then ministering to Bill Clinton, pondering another presidential run every four years, while his political arm, the Rainbow Coalition, and his Chicago organization, Operation PUSH, declined into irrelevance.
The country seemed to leave Jackson behind: with the Dow Jones soaring, the poor disappearing from view along with the liberal wing of the Democratic Party. When welfare reform, the most drastic revision of social policy in decades, was being debated in 1996, Jackson's voice was strikingly muted.
But with the advent of the Wall Street Project, he has remade himself into the outsider's insider, moving from civil rights advocate and mass leader to power broker. "He could become the black Clark Clifford," says Don Rose, a Chicago political consultant and associate of Jackson's during the 1960's. "He's almost a wise man. He's part of the American establishment. Even Jesse Helms knows that."
Rainbow/PUSH, moribund a few years ago, is now flush with contributions from a long list of corporations, including some targets of Jackson's criticism, and staffed by a new crop of black professionals -- lawyers, journalists, money managers -- bringing a low-key culture clash with the older, mostly female, fanatically dedicated lifers from the years of dashikis and collection boxes. "It used to be more of a movement," says Louise Greene, an elderly volunteer. "It's more corporate now."
If the Wall Street Project lacks the high moral tone of the civil rights movement, it only echoes the noise of a bottom-line society moved more by power and access than by moral appeal. Jackson seems to have reached the shrewd conclusion that Bill Clinton's America is not much swayed by a desire for economic justice, and that government is unlikely to attempt anything on the scale of the movement's gains. And who can blame him for facing these facts?
"There is no position of a mass leader in our society," says Don Rose. "The job has been abolished." In July, at Jackson's urging, Clinton took a tour of poor areas around the country as part of his New Markets Initiative -- the chief antipoverty proposal of his presidency -- calling for $1.6 billion in tax credits and loan guarantees. That's not much more than Bill Gates recently promised for minority scholarships -- indicative of the country's move from public to private philanthropy. "We're on Wall Street," Jackson says, "because that's where the capital is."
To understand Jackson's latest campaign, you have to go back to the last years of the civil rights movement and the last days of Martin Luther King Jr.'s life. Jackson makes a large historical claim for what he is doing today. He calls the fight for access to capital the "fourth stage of the freedom struggle," after emancipation, desegregation and voting rights. And for precedent he often brings up the staff meeting King held on his last birthday, Jan. 15, 1968: a racially diverse group of civil rights veterans and liberal allies gathered in Atlanta to plan what would become King's final battle, the Poor People's Campaign -- an attempt to shift the movement's focus from racial segregation to economic justice.
What Jackson doesn't tell audiences today is that he and King fought bitterly over the Poor People's Campaign. It was an ideological fight, and also a classic Oedipal quarrel between a famous father who expected loyalty to his life's work and an ambitious son who revered him yet wanted to make his own mark. King, middle class and secure in his parents' love, grew up with the luxury of humble virtue. Jackson, born poor and illegitimate, fought his way into the world through sheer force of character and by dint of hard work -- Since I was 6 I was never not working," he says -- reading the newspaper to illiterate neighbors, parking cars outside football games and waiting tables.
One night in early 1965, while studying at the Chicago Theological Seminary, he turned on the television and watched a phalanx of Alabama state policemen assault a column of voting rights marchers in Selma. The next day, Jackson drove south and bulled his way into King's startled inner circle. Soon he dropped out of divinity school and became King's man in Chicago, where he headed Operation Breadbasket and helped take the movement north.
By threatening picket lines and boycotts, Breadbasket forced businesses in the city's black neighborhoods to hire local residents, deposit money in black-owned banks, give contracts to black garbage collectors and exterminators and stock black brands like Mumbo barbecue sauce and Joe Louis milk on supermarket shelves. Within two years, Breadbasket had brought 3,000 jobs to Chicago blacks and swelled the yearly income of South Side residents by $22 million. Black businessmen floated the payroll of King's desperately pinched organization.
Despite this success, mentor and protege were beginning to clash. While King was moving toward democratic socialism, Jackson was moving toward black capitalism. "His experience of the private sector was not substantial," Jackson says of King now. "He believed that the government was more likely to do what it had done before. But I believed we had to build a private-sector body of allies." Here, perhaps, Jackson was the more visionary man.
But just a few days before heading to Memphis for a garbage workers strike, King finally exploded. "If you want to carve out your own niche in society, go ahead," he shouted at Jackson. "But for God's sake, don't bother me!" Jackson had to endure his terrible loss of favor until the last moments of King's life. When King stepped out onto the balcony of the Lorraine Motel, he saw Jackson standing in the parking lot and called out, "Jesse, I want you to come to dinner with me." Then came the crack of gunfire.
Within minutes of the shooting, Jackson had King's blood on his turtleneck, which he wore in public the next day. He and Don Rose quickly sized up Jackson's prospects as King's heir. His death left a great hole that Jackson has spent three decades trying to fill. But with liberalism's long decline since the 1960's, no great dramas have brought his career into focus as Montgomery and Birmingham did King's. Now, at 58, Jackson is returning to his first mission. The Wall Street Project, he told me, is "a matured version of Breadbasket."
When I asked Jackson why he believes that the main struggle is no longer racial but economic, he muttered, "Lemme show you something." He got up from his chair and led me over to the panoramic corner windows of his hotel suite, 32 floors above Chicago. It was 7 a.m., and he had already been up for two hours, reading the papers, conferring with aides in the permanent campaign that is the substance of his days. His eyes were hooded, his voice low and hoarse. Jackson extended his finger north, toward the cluster of skyscrapers shrouded in a charcoal cloud cover.
"That's the Loop," he said. "The price of grain is determined every day in the world down on La Salle Street. That's where the financial capital is." Then Jackson pointed south toward Englewood, an impoverished neighborhood of single-family houses, part of which is in the district his son, Jesse Jackson Jr., represents in Congress.
"Today, the gap is between La Salle Street and Englewood," the senior Jackson said. "Englewood can't miss as an area of awesome potential, but the capital has been cut off." The class gap, he said, "is legal -- and widening. Historically if you say there's a race gap, then we're primed to react because of slavery, because of segregation. But somehow it's almost un-American to speak of a class gap."
Englewood represents one of the Wall Street Project's biggest challenges. Jackson and I would later take a walk through its streets with Mary Flowers, one of the district's state representatives. Half the houses seemed to be abandoned, and a few of the lots were vacant. "Who would loan them something to fix up their house?" Flowers asked in front of an occupied single-family whose porch was caving in. "See the flowerpot? She's trying, absolutely. The little what-nots in the window -- they're doing the best they can, but you think the bank will loan them some money?"
Jackson chimed in. "We have programs to develop other countries," he said. "Englewood is less risky than Indonesia. The government's more stable."
I asked if a bank loan was all that stood between these residents and regeneration.
"It's a hell of a step," Jackson said curtly.
Jackson has a remarkable ability to register the social landscape in its most immediate physical form and absorb it on the run into the framework of his ideas. The first time I met him, we were driving to La Guardia Airport when he suddenly gestured toward Brooklyn and began comparing the Wall Street Project to the Dodgers' signing of Jackie Robinson: "See, the issue never was that there was a talent deficit -- there was an opportunity deficit. Those in charge said that they were directing the major leagues. They were directing the white leagues. It wasn't 'major' till everybody could be in the free market." The analogy seemed quick-witted and apt; I've grown less fond of it since hearing him make it several dozen times.
Jackson seamlessly weaves the set pieces of his speeches into ordinary conversation, and if you spend enough time with him you begin to pick up the rhythm of their approach until, sure enough, thinking aloud suddenly morphs into stock phrasing without the slightest loss of conviction. At one point during the conference, I was trailing Jackson and Bill Bradley down a glass-encased walkway with a spectacular view of Lake Michigan, assuming these two outsize men were talking political turkey. Getting closer, I discovered that Jackson was the only one talking. I picked up the words "fourth stage," but they were enough -- I suspected that I knew by heart the rest of the soliloquy Bradley was hearing.
Having decided not to run, Jackson has thus far withheld his endorsement from both Bradley and Al Gore. In politics as in finance, access to power is creating problems for Jackson. Bradley's proposals on poverty and health care seem more like the ambitious liberalism of Jackson's own presidential campaign. But he has stronger personal ties to the vice president and seems to be leaning toward a Gore endorsement. "Gore's longer relationships with civil rights organizations in the crunch might be the difference," Jackson told me.
As for the president, he and Jackson have had a turbulent relationship ever since 1992, when Clinton strategically distanced himself from the Rainbow Coalition. Recently they've grown closer, though, as Jackson counseled Clinton during the Lewinsky scandal and then joined him on the July New Markets tour. Gene Sperling, the president's economic adviser, says: "I went into the relationship with Jackson with some skepticism. But he's been great -- more reasonable, more practical, more committed than most people you deal with in this town."
Jackson's attitude toward Clinton ranges from political criticism to "pastoral and brotherly" care to a clear-eyed analysis that can sound like self-description. "He wants to be a friend of the wealthy," Jackson says, but adds, "In his heart I think he wants to be seen as an emancipator of the poor."
Representative Jesse Jackson Jr. is more critical than his father of Clinton, Gore and Bradley. He wishes a traditional liberal would enter the presidential race -- a candidate more like the runner-up in the 1988 primaries, Jesse Jackson Sr. The relationship between father and son is strong enough that they don't hesitate to disagree publicly. When Jackson Sr. stood alongside President Clinton in the Englewood section of Chicago in November to tout the New Markets Initiative, Jackson Jr. "listened very carefully for deliverables," he says. "I heard none, and there were none."
Talking about his father's Wall Street Project, the younger Jackson says, "It's a great concept at the level stockbrokers and investment bankers play." But he also offers criticism that keeps his own constituency in mind. "Some minorities are at that level," he says, "but too few of them to affect the Second District of Illinois. It looks like we're helping too few people." Partly to correct this impression, he and his father have written a book, due out in January, called "It's About the Money!" which offers financial advice to families of more limited means.
But in spite of their obvious closeness, any talk of a Jackson transfer of power makes both men bristle. "The Reverend is part of the prophetic tradition," Representative Jackson says. "I am part of the political tradition."
Jesse Jackson Sr. has not lost his passion for those "left behind." He still flies into little towns like Godfrey, Ill., to hearten striking health-care workers whom scarcely anyone else has noticed. He arranges visits between inner-city and suburban Chicago high schools to open students' eyes to the vast inequalities of the "class gap."
In the middle of the Rainbow/PUSH conference he bolted off to address a rally of union janitors who were losing their jobs to outside workers. Within minutes they were on their feet as Jackson exhorted: "Save the workers! Save the families! Keep hope alive!" The words are beyond familiar, but the effect is still genuine.
Jackson's support of minority-owned businesses sometimes gets entangled with his concern about union jobs and wages. There's a contradiction at the heart of his efforts to emphasize class instead of race. "Diversity" has become orthodox thinking in most corporate boardrooms, whereas the need for unions and greater income equality has not -- so the Wall Street Project has ended up addressing the class gap largely through the traditional apparatus of the race gap.
The Rev. Al Sharpton points out that unlike Operation Breadbasket, which had the force of a movement behind it, the Wall Street Project doesn't draw up written covenants with corporations. Rainbow/PUSH surveys companies' hiring practices for minority representation, but the results depend entirely on the pull of a single man, Jackson, with business leaders. Without him, the project would presumably be over.
But the real question is, Who benefits? "Everyone who's left behind," Jackson told me. "If it's just for minorities, then it's open to manipulation." So far, however, the most conspicuous beneficiaries have been a handful of black investment bankers brought in as co-managers and underwriters on some of Wall Street's most lucrative new stock-and-bond issues.
"He gets you into the playing field," Shawn Baldwin, the securities trader from the Rainbow/PUSH conference, told me. "It's a very crowded playing field. He brokers access." Young, intensely driven and adamant that blacks aren't given the chance to prove themselves in the financial world, Baldwin has no interest in Jackson's politics. He often votes Republican and only learned of Jackson's new campaign by reading that Donald Trump had donated Wall Street office space to Rainbow/PUSH. Baldwin described Jackson's role as "almost like a gangster" who calls a meeting to which no one can refuse to come. "After that," he says, "it's up to you."
How these openings for a new generation of black financiers will close the "class gap" is a question that no one except Jackson himself seems able to answer persuasively. The answers I got from others were anecdotal or highly speculative. David Ormes, C.E.O. of Ormes Capital Markets in New York, whose business has tripled since the project began in 1997, told me that he has hired a trader who had been making $50,000 a year selling TV ad time and who would have been overlooked by white firms. Now, Ormes says, "the guy, who made 700 grand, was able to take his kid, put him in a $20,000-a-year private school and hire a Mexican maid." Another recruit has bought a Harlem brownstone and employs local plumbers and carpenters.
In other words, the answer sounds like trickle-down economics -- a phrase that Chee Chee Williams, director of the Wall Street Project, embraced when I floated it. We are all Lafferites now.
The most striking thing about the Wall Street Project is that hardly anyone is against it. A few conservatives call it a quota. A few liberals, like Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, propose far greater levels of government involvement. A few finance experts have questioned whether the investment funds and tax credits can overcome entrenched poverty. A few C.E.O.'s have grumbled privately about the pressure they've come under. But on the whole, Jackson is no longer controversial.
One morning in Chicago, I went to visit Tyrone Galtney, a resident of the Robert Taylor Homes, where 16,000 black Chicagoans are packed into the 16-story high rises in one of the country's worst concentrations of misery. I had met Galtney between events at the Rainbow/PUSH conference, where, in the available three seconds, he was trying to get Jackson's support to resist the demolition of the projects. Hundreds of petitioners write, call or approach Jackson every day; he gave Galtney a name to call. Three weeks later, he hadn't heard back.
"You never see Jesse Jackson coming through here saying, Stop the violence, stop the killing," he complained in his cramped room, surrounded by stereo equipment, computer hardware and piles of papers for the degree he's pursuing in urban planning. "If you can go to Kosovo, Bosnia, why can't you come to the Robert Taylor Homes?"
I began to understand why Belgrade under NATO bombing might be preferable when Galtney gave me a tour of the high rises. His purpose was to show me that "it's totally a normal life" and that the answer was honest management, not demolition. But the smell of urine in the hallways and sewage in the courtyards, the out-of-service elevators, the pitch-black stairwell, the prison-grade steel webbing that encased the buildings, the young drug courier grinning boyishly at us as he played hide-and-seek with plainclothes cops -- an hour and a half into Galtney's tour, his case was in ruins.
When I raised the issue of the Robert Taylor Homes as a tough test case for the Wall Street Project, Jackson pointed out that Deval Patrick, former assistant attorney general for civil rights and now a corporate counsel at the recently diversified Texaco, grew up near there. "What separates these kids from success is opportunity, nothing else," he said.
Don Rose, Jackson's former associate, is perhaps more candid. "There are problems in the black community for which he has no solution," he says. "Drugs, crime, not just unemployment but unemployability -- that's a pretty gritty level to deal on, and no one has any programmatic answer. Jesse doesn't. Trickle-down isn't going to change that. The sociopathy of the ghetto is hard core." Contrasting those problems with the Wall Street Project, Rose says, "I believe they're beyond him, and this is something he can do."
Even in Decatur, Ill., where the problems are not nearly so intractable, Jackson's weeks of demonstrations accomplished little. The school board reduced the students' expulsion from two years to one, but refused to budge further. Jackson is now appealing to the courts.
For all the dollars-and-cents talk of his Wall Street Project, Jackson still needs the language, the imprimatur, of the civil rights movement -- and not only as one of his levers in prying open the doors of power. He needs it also for his own sake. He is still clearly haunted by the memory and example of King, who crops up in conversation every three minutes, as if Jackson isn't entirely comfortable with his own hard-won success and still seeks the posthumous blessing of a man who died fighting for garbage workers. Asked what he reads in his spare time, Jackson answers Niebuhr and Tillich -- King's guiding Christian theologians. Out of grandiosity or goodness or some mix of the two, Jackson can't do anything without placing it in the terms of historical struggle and Biblical morality.
One Friday night after I returned from Chicago, the phone rang. It was Jackson, and he was saying: "There are roads that lead out of Wall Street in different directions. Some of them expand to South Africa. Some lead to Appalachia, the Mississippi Delta. Or to the Hamptons."
I didn't know what he was talking about. But soon his point became clear. It was the beginning of Labor Day weekend, and he had received a number of invitations from C.E.O.'s to spend it at their vacation homes on Long Island. When I asked if he was going, Jackson threw out, almost as an aside, "No, too busy" -- but it was as if he wanted me to know that he was in no one's pocket. He might be on Wall Street but he wasn't of it.
"The project doesn't get away from race," he went on, "because people of color have the double burden of caste and class. You've got sunshine on your side, and over here is shadows and a ceiling. My class is low because of my caste."
He never tires of talking about these things. In all the hours I spent with him there was never any small talk, no interest in personal questions. Suddenly, he had to go -- but before hanging up, there was one more thing he wanted me to know. The new president of Chicago Theological Seminary had pulled his records out of the vault, and a faculty group had decided that he did enough course work in the 1960's to graduate. Next spring, the Rev. Jesse Jackson will finally receive the Master of Divinity degree that he was six months short of earning when Martin Luther King persuaded him to leave the seminary at age 24 and join the movement.

 BODY:
At this late date in the century -- the century defined by the American success story -- the two men considered most likely to succeed to the presidency are both running away from their pasts. One, brought up in a ritzy hotel by a Washington political family, has reinvented himself as a down-home Tennessean; the other, a political prince educated at Andover, Yale and Harvard, is now a man of the people in cowboy boots. The man whose job they covet, of course, is the former Bill Blythe, son of a traveling salesman and product of the disreputable gambling town of Hot Springs, Ark., who, via Georgetown, Oxford and Yale, long ago remade himself (for a while anyway) into the Man From Hope.
In the parallel private realm of America -- that of business -- the folk hero du jour is Jim Clark, Silicon Valley entrepreneur extraordinaire, who, in the words of his chronicler Michael Lewis, has "no past, only a future." A dirt-poor kid from Plainview, Tex., who was expelled from high school, Clark acquired new wives, friends and colleagues as he reinvented himself (on his way to retooling cyberspace) at the threshold of middle age. 
 Our youth culture is dominated by hip-hop, which has become a means for white kids to reconfigure themselves as black. The god of adult commerce is Martha Stewart, who, like Ralph Lauren before her, instructs us all on how to be old-school white. In a country where obsession with body image is now a transgenerational religion, the metamorphoses promised by plastic surgery outnumber Baskin-Robbins flavors and are nearly as accessible to all. Those who wish to remake themselves in gender, age or biography without invasive surgery, whether for fun, profit or criminality, need merely trot out a new screen name on America Online, which in its 5.0 upgrade increases the number of possible fictive identities per subscriber from five to seven.
It's into this fluid turn-of-the-century America -- when even outlaws come in the chameleon guises of Andrew Cunanan and Martin Frankel -- that a new, nightmarish and highly apt movie called "The Talented Mr. Ripley" is being released just in time for the holidays. In what has been widely considered a strong year for adult American movies and a celebratory year for a nation riding an unprecedented boom, "Ripley" occupies its own strange niche. Neither the work of a breakout young director like David O. Russell ("Three Kings"), Spike Jonze ("Being John Malkovich") or Paul Thomas Anderson ("Magnolia") -- nor one of the season's adaptations of admired best sellers ("Angela's Ashes," "The Green Mile," "Snow Falling on Cedars") -- Ripley" is the unexpected intruder that, however compelling, is just nasty enough to threaten to sour the New Year's party. Complicating matters further, the movie arrives subversively disguised as a glossy high-middlebrow treat. It was written and directed by Anthony Minghella, of the Oscar-anointed "English Patient"; it stars the gilded Matt Damon and Gwyneth Paltrow; it is sumptuously set in the Technicolor 1950's in lush climes stretching from a penthouse terrace on Central Park West to Venice, Rome, San Remo and a bucolic, cliffhanging village on the Amalfi Coast. But for all those glittering trappings, "Ripley" is not a benign romantic epic, not a feel-good picture with an uplifting denouement like "Good Will Hunting" or "Shakespeare in Love." Damon and Paltrow are not a couple in the film, and they would as soon kill each other as kiss.
To put it bluntly, "The Talented Mr. Ripley" will not be 1999's most popular movie. The studio may well know this: why else blanket the country with an entertainment this black on Christmas Day except out of the hope that star power will pull in an audience before there's time for too much backlash over its creepiness, its violence, its homoerotic sexuality and its defiance of the moral closure usually provided by big-budget Hollywood entertainments. (In "Ripley," grisly crimes do not necessarily lead to punishment.) Yet like the film it sometimes consciously evokes, Alfred Hitchcock's "Vertigo," which earned mixed reviews and unexceptional box-office returns in its initial release, "Ripley" will attract at the very least a passionate cult. It's not only a very unlikely big-studio product but also one that speaks keenly to our moment in a disturbing, haunting voice. "When you see where you live from a distance, it's like a dream, isn't it?" says the movie's title character in a late throwaway line that seems to recapitulate the movie's own startling perspective on where we live. With appropriate fin de si<heart>cle melancholy and the relentlessness of a thriller, "Ripley" nails both the wonder that has attended our century's celebratory version of the American dream and the anxiety that is stirred up by that dream's stealthy doppelg<diamond=nger, the American tragedy that befalls the Gatsbyesque dreamer who goes too far.
"Ripley" asks us to identify with an American man who, like so many before him, believes in the democratic ethos that says anyone can jettison the past, wipe the slate clean and with pluck and luck be whoever he or she wants to be. The earnest, upwardly mobile Tom Ripley, played by Damon, isn't particularly greedy or ambitious, but he does want to rise above his drab circumstances to grab the right, socially acceptable lifestyle, along with love and money. By the time he takes a wrong turn in pursuit of his fantasy, we're already along for the ride, rooting for his success and happiness as we might for our own, even if that means we become locked with our outlaw hero in a very dark and solitary place -- even if, to our extreme discomfort, we find ourselves, in our secret heart of hearts, rooting for him to get away with murder.
'Ripley" opens in 1958, the same year "Vertigo" was released -- a year, like our own, of extraordinary prosperity and, again perhaps like our own, the tail end of an era. When we first meet its title character, he's a pallid, immaculate young man, with Clark Kent glasses and the fastidious manners of a manservant or corporate accountant. But he lives in a mean cold-water flat in Manhattan, and his actual job is as an attendant in a concert-hall lavatory, where he brushes dandruff from rich men in tuxedos as they splash themselves with Old Spice.
Thanks to a borrowed navy blazer and a chance encounter, Tom encourages one rich man, a shipping magnate named Herbert Greenleaf, in his mistaken belief that Tom had been at Princeton with his son, Dickie, class of '56. Dickie Greenleaf -- a dazzling all-American golden boy and a role very likely to confer stardom on the British actor Jude Law -- is off idling in Italy, sybaritically pursuing a dilettante's calling as a jazz saxophonist and a romance with Marge Sherwood (Paltrow), an aspiring writer from his Park Avenue set. Dickie's disapproving dad offers Tom $1,000 to visit his son in Italy and bring him home to take his rightful place in the family business.
The movie's first moments -- the Paramount logo, the warped-lullaby musical theme (by Gabriel Yared) reminiscent of Bernard Herrmann's for "Vertigo," the jagged credits in the style of Saul Bass's for "North by Northwest" -- almost explicitly recall Hitchcock's high-style movies of the 50's, in which that mercurial director sometimes took perverse delight in casting James Stewart, American Everyman, in neurotic roles far removed from his angelic Frank Capra heroes. In "Vertigo," Stewart was John (Scottie) Ferguson, a smart, emotionally remote detective whose psyche plunges into voyeurism and sexual obsession once he is sent by a shipping magnate on a mission that tosses him into a bizarre plot of mistaken identity, murder and suicides both real and faked. In "Ripley," Damon, only recently seen as Steven Spielberg's American Everyman, Private Ryan, portrays another smart, emotionally reticent Peeping Tom, and his parallel assignment for another shipping magnate tosses him into similar horrors. The tight-lipped Tom Ripley, looking a bit like the pre-superstar Andy Warhol of the 50's, falls in love with the bronzed, self-assured Dickie Greenleaf as surely as Stewart did with his "Vertigo" quarry, Kim Novak.
But there he and his predecessor part. Where Scottie wants to remake the Novak character into his dream girl, Tom wants to remake himself into his dream boy. He wants to duplicate Dickie -- in looks, in savoir-faire, in Gucci accessories -- until he can pass as being to the manner, and perhaps even to the Greenleaf manor, born. "I always thought, Better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody," Tom says, and no matter what the human cost, including the annihilation of his own self, he will not be denied. Clark Kent wills himself into Superman, but a Superman as ruthless as Macbeth.
Damon is in every scene of the film and, with his initially bookish and wholesome presence, serves as its irresistible bait. There's much to like about Tom. He's cultured (he travels with the collected Shakespeare and Blue Guides), talented (he plays Bach at the piano) and sensitive (he seems to care for Dickie's variously ill-treated women more tenderly than Dickie does). Tom is the intelligent, poor and shy nerd who craves only to be part of the "in" crowd, and what American, from junior high school on, does not know that desperate feeling of wanting to mortgage one's soul in order to fit in?
"Everybody's not been invited to the dance at one time or another," says Damon, who took on the gutsy and demanding assignment -- for which he lost weight, studied piano and modulated his vocal pitch and posture -- in part because of his identification with the character's "total discomfort in his identity" and his compassion for the character's "deep, intense loneliness." Though now in constant demand, the 29-year-old actor still vividly recalls the seven-year drought of obscure roles and rejection that sent him into despair about his career. Minghella's screenplay is particularly harrowing in its dramatization of Tom's wallflower status among the rich kids of Dickie's circle -- a poignant class-consciousness it shares with the script Damon wrote with Ben Affleck for "Good Will Hunting." When Tom is mocked for his square corduroy sport jacket or his "bourgeois" taste in furnishings or his inability to ski -- or is literally left to stand on the outside looking in through a window as Dickie and a condescending society pal or Dickie and Marge exchange intimacies he can never share -- it's hard not to feel the character's panicked sense of exclusion and isolation, of envy and rejection, his aching hunger to be chosen, to be part of the club, to be wanted, to be loved.
Tom Ripley was born in the imagination of the novelist Patricia Highsmith (1921-95), who made a life's work of her ostracization from the American mainstream and her own subsequent self-reinvention. "Everyone in the book is making themselves up in some shape or form, and that's what she was doing herself," as Minghella puts it. Born to separated, soon-to-be-divorced parents as Mary Patricia Plangman (she later took her stepfather's surname), Highsmith was at first reared by a grandmother in Fort Worth, then moved at age 6 with her mother, a fashion illustrator for Women's Wear Daily, to Greenwich Village. Later, Highsmith would tell interviewers matter-of-factly of how she didn't meet her father until she was 12 and of how her mother had tried to abort her by drinking turpentine five months into pregnancy. After graduating from Julia Richman High School and Barnard, Highsmith made a living writing scenarios for action comic books, then started her own itinerant wanderings through America. "The Talented Mr. Ripley," the second of Highsmith's 20-odd books, was written in 1955 as she uprooted herself from Massachusetts to Santa Fe. Finally, she fled to Europe, where she spent most of her adult life. "If you have an imagination that goes far afield, you can live far afield," she once said.
In a rare TV interview she granted London Weekend Television's "South Bank Show" in the early 1980's, Highsmith is a forbidding, unsmiling figure in a Burberry trench coat with a pugnacious, pouchy face framed by thick, parted black hair; she looks rather like her favorite bird, the owl. At the end she was living alone in a remote Italian village with a population of 250 perched in mountainous Switzerland. Tom Ripley -- whom she belatedly brought back in four other books; the first, 15 years after his debut -- was her favorite creation. "He could be called psychotic," she said, defending him against the charge of amorality leveled by her interviewer, Melvyn Bragg. "But I would not call him insane because his actions are rational. . . . I consider him a rather civilized person who kills when he absolutely has to." If there's "not much to be admired" about him, she added, he was also "not entirely to be censured."
Highsmith's sympathy for her devil ran deep. Her own tastes were dark and darker. Her favorite writer was Dostoyevsky; a favorite artist was Francis Bacon (for "the way he sees mankind throwing up into a toilet"); and among her favorite American authors was the emotionally isolated, class-minded, expatriated Henry James (the plot setup of "Ripley" deliberately mirroring a late James masterpiece, "The Ambassadors"). She wasn't reader-friendly. She wrote in what Minghella astutely calls "an impatient and irritable prose," creating "an airless, claustrophobic world" in which the supporting characters often amount to stick figures.
In the literary arena, Highsmith never got the breaks of the blue-chip authors of her time. Her first novel, the 1950 "Strangers on a Train," which lays out some of the "Ripley" themes of class envy, identity switching and male-male infatuation (beta with alpha, in current lingo), was snapped up by Hitchcock and made into a classic film. But the director had kept his identity covert while pursuing the rights, thereby nabbing the book for the bargain price of $7,500, and the screenplay's famous co-writer Raymond Chandler got more credit for what was on-screen than did the obscure author of the novel that was its source. Highsmith did have her literary champions, including Truman Capote (who successfully boosted her application to the Yaddo writers' colony in 1948) and Graham Greene (who celebrated her as "the poet of apprehension" in a 1970 essay), but her books sold better in Europe than America. "Her amoral explorations of perverse behavior have confused American readers of crime fiction" was how The Times summed up her cult status in 1988. Only in 1991 did Highsmith reveal that her own identities included "Claire Morgan," the author of "The Price of Salt," a paperback lesbian novel that sold a million copies nearly 40 years earlier. By then her career was taking on a certain bleak circularity: just as "Strangers on a Train" had been rejected by six publishers at the start, so her final novel, "Small g: A Summer Idyll," was rejected by Knopf (though published in Europe) the year she died, nearly a half-century later. As a postscript Highsmith might well find unamusing, Knopf has brought out three of the "Ripley" novels this fall in a handsome, if posthumous, Everyman's edition.
'The talented Mr. Ripley" was made into a movie once before, the French "Purple Noon," which Rene Clement directed in 1960, with Alain Delon as Ripley. It tacked on a morally unambiguous ending, reversed Ripley's implicit sexuality and de-Americanized its characters. (A later Ripley novel, "Ripley's Game," was the basis for Wim Wenders's film "The American Friend" in the 70's, with Dennis Hopper as Ripley.) Minghella was hired to write the current version by its executive producer, Sydney Pollack, when "The English Patient" was in limbo; Minghella finished his first draft just as his movie went into rehearsal in Rome. He hadn't originally planned to direct "Ripley" but found himself so captivated by the material that he asked the studio to wait for him until he was free to take it on. Once "The English Patient" hit it big and other offers flooded in, he could have abandoned Highsmith for safer ground but didn't. Even so, "this film was never intended to be more than a chamber film," the director said in one of a series of conversations we had in Berkeley, Calif., while he was completing the editing of "Ripley" at the Saul Zaentz Film Center. Like him, the star actors all committed to this risky project before their biggest career breakthroughs might have pulled them in more conventional directions: Damon before the release of "Good Will Hunting," Paltrow before she had signed on to "Shakespeare in Love," Cate Blanchett as she was still shooting "Elizabeth."
Blanchett, intriguingly, plays a character that didn't exist in Highsmith: another expatriate East Side socialite who gets caught in the Tom-Dickie web. In a witty inversion of Ripley's efforts to trade up in social class, she uses an assumed name to disguise her identity as a textile heiress. As written and acted, the role adds a shimmering Jamesian portrait of a trapped American woman to the canvas, and it is but one of many significant alterations Minghella has made to the novel. Dickie's father, played by James Rebhorn, has been deepened into a more controlling Jamesian blueblood; two deaths and other characters have been added as well, even as some of the book's plot devices have been streamlined.
"You've drunk the drink, and the taste that's left in your mouth is what you go with," says Minghella of "the mystery of adaptation." (His next project is Charles Frazier's "Cold Mountain.") Much as his "English Patient" found its own idiosyncratic path into creating a screen blueprint for Michael Ondaatje's diffuse novel ("A thousand stories and no narrative," as Minghella describes it), so his "Ripley" is a riff on Highsmith. Literally so: in the novel, Dickie is a would-be painter, not a sax player. By making the switch, Minghella, himself a pianist, is able to interject cuts by Dizzy Gillespie, Sonny Rollins and other greats of the period, to invoke Blue Note record jackets as visual talismans and to turn Dickie and Tom's thwarted bond into an almost musical duet. The closest their relationship comes to some sort of unspoken consummation is an early nocturnal scene in a smoky Naples jazz club where Dickie's sultry sax partners with Tom's tentative piano on "My Funny Valentine." It's a cultural moment of exquisite nuance: Damon (in his own voice) precisely mimics the tragic Chet Baker's famous androgynous rendition of the song, whose lyric carries the bittersweet longing of its tragically unhappy author, Lorenz Hart, a closeted, alcoholic homosexual who saw himself as a graceless outsider among the glamorous show-biz elite. Hart's lyrics -- Is your figure less than Greek? Is your mouth a little weak? When you open it to speak, are you smart?" -- take on a chilling double meaning.
Minghella, who is not gay, also had to figure out what to do about the book's use of Ripley's guarded sexual identity. In the novel, Marge says dismissively of Tom: "All right, he may not be queer. He's just a nothing, which is worse. He isn't normal enough to have any kind of sex life, if you know what I mean." Marge speaks for the vacillating Highsmith, who once said of Tom that he's a "little bit homosexual . . . not that he's ever done anything about that." (In the later Ripley books, she none-too-convincingly marries him off.) Minghella agrees that the character is a virgin who has been left out of sex as he has been left out of life's parties, but he is more candid in displaying Tom's unspoken desire for (and tenderness toward) Dickie. In one of the movie's saddest, at times hallucinatory motifs, Damon repeatedly steals glances of Jude Law in any reflected surface he can find, expressing his affection with a terrified furtiveness that is at once sinister and heartbreaking.
But in the novel, Tom is also given a castrating aunt and a window-decorator roommate back in America, not to mention a physical attraction to a group of "fairies" he spies performing acrobatics on a Cannes beach and gratuitous loathing asides about female anatomy and undergarments. Minghella removes Highsmith's Freudian cliches, the stereotypes, the lingo of "perverts" and "sissies" -- only to find that his movie could land in another potential minefield by 1990's P.C. standards. Could the new "Ripley" be found guilty of equating homosexuality with Tom's criminal pathology? Even before he completed the film, the director was starting to receive calls from journalists raising the question.
Minghella says of Tom's attraction to Dickie: "The studio would have been thrilled if it was transmogrified into a love for Marge -- he wants the life, so he wants the girl! Having not done that, you lay yourself open to criticism for dramatizing a man with ambivalent sexuality who kills people. I'm desperate that no one infer a connection between his actions in the film and his sexuality. But it's a sorry state of affairs if you can only write about a homosexual character who behaves well -- that's another kind of tyranny, I think. The minute you try to pull back from what's sensual and erotic, you're losing your nerve, and I just didn't want to shrink away from the romance of it; it's very tender to me. It seems to me so much the fabric of the story -- not so much that Tom was gay but that he was in love with Dickie and with Dickie's life."
As balance, and to provide a stunning plot twist not in Highsmith, Minghella has expanded a character who appears in only a few lines in the novel, Peter Smith-Kingsley (Jack Davenport), into an important player, "a gay person who is centered and comfortable with himself." Without making a case out of it, the movie also generates sympathy for Tom as a closeted homosexual with a boldness that wouldn't have been ventured by Highsmith in the 50's. Tom is mocked by Dickie's snottiest upper-crust pal, Freddie Miles (another dead-on character turn by Philip Seymour Hoffman), not just for his lack of Princetonian wealth and breeding but also for his unmentionable sexuality, the meanest cut of all to an odd man out desperate to fit in with Dickie's clique.
For all his alterations, Minghella has contradicted the book's intentions in only one substantive way: his Ripley has the stirrings of a conscience (if, say, Stewart in "Vertigo" can be said to have a conscience). The director is willing to risk criticisms from Highsmith purists. "There's so much nihilism in film right now," he explains. "If I'm going to tell a story that's so bleak and so much a journey of a soul, if in the end Ripley was just going to go about his business, what's the journey?" In Minghella's view, to do so "is a cynical statement, and a very easy one." Just the same, the ending of "Ripley" is about as upbeat and sentimental as, say, the final glimpse of Al Pacino as Michael Corleone in "Godfather II" -- with which "Ripley" shares its editor, Walter Murch, as close a collaborator to Minghella as he has been to Francis Ford Coppola. During their final weeks on the film, the director and editor kept tinkering subtly with the closing footage of Damon so that Minghella could land the cathartic blow he wanted, in which the audience is left alone with Ripley in an inky psychological no man's land.
Everywhere else the film enhances the novel rather than challenges it. A soft-spoken Englishman reared on the Isle of Wight by working-class parents of Italian immigrant stock who ran an ice-cream business and morning-to-midnight cafe, the 45-year-old Minghella relates intensely to Ripley's and Highsmith's outsider status. "Every English person was a Dickie Greenleaf to me," he says of his childhood, and he drew heavily on his adolescent longings in the script, his memories "of being behind the glass of an ice-cream van" serving better-off neighbors, of delivering his parents' wares through the tradesmen's entrance of the Isle of Wight's moneyed Royal Yacht Squadron. But he has also deepened the movie's reach as a totemic American fable. A serious student of American culture since he arrived as a young man at the University of Hull, where he ultimately became a lecturer in drama before beginning his writing career in theater and television, Minghella gets the bigger picture right. From the vantage point of the century's end -- and the perspective of an outsider -- he has set Highsmith's story within a historical context that wouldn't have been possible at midcentury.
Advancing the novel's time frame from the early to the late 50's, Minghella has been able to capitalize on the voluptuous Italy of "il boom" -- a belated postwar prosperity as giddy as America's. The wealthy, sexually liberated Rome of the movie's key sequences is right out of the 1959 "La Dolce Vita," a backdrop in contrast to the relatively strait-laced Americans in the foreground. Even in their Continental idyll, where they try to reinvent themselves as slumming bohemian artistes and Camus-caffeinated existentialists, Dickie and Marge covet kitchen appliances and sports cars; they nominally maintain separate residences rather than shacking up, as befits the conventions of their social class and the pre-60's, pre-birth-control-pill culture. When Tom sees two Italian men being physically affectionate with each other -- an image inspired by a Cartier-Bresson photo of the period -- he recoils as if mortified, even though it's an intimacy he craves.
To Minghella, an important aspect of his movie, which could be teased out of the novel only with the advantage of 1990's hindsight, is "the collusion of men during a period in American social history when it was at its zenith" -- that is, in the years just before the dawn of "The Feminine Mystique." In this sense, he feels Paltrow won't get enough credit for a performance that in the 50's could have been a Grace Kelly glamour turn ("Hitchcock would have cast Gwyneth in everything"), but when refracted through a 90's lens is in service of "a thankless role." Though Marge is the character who sees most clearly through Ripley's game, she is manipulated or patronized by every man on-screen, straight or gay, including Dickie's father -- each of whom is intent on keeping her in her place and in the dark. For the film's narcissistic straight men, she's a good egg (rather like Midge, Scottie's doormat of a sometime girlfriend, played by Barbara Bel Geddes, in "Vertigo"); for the closeted gay characters, she's an unwitting beard. Marge at times seems a particularly cruel variation on Sugar (Marilyn Monroe) of Billy Wilder's "Some Like It Hot" (1959), who is humiliated for farcical but selfish purposes by two men who have reinvented themselves as women. Marge could also pass as a grim revisionist replay of Doris Day being strung along by Rock Hudson in "Pillow Talk" (also '59): in the retrospectively bizarre environment of that "light comedy," Hudson, a gay man in real life, plays a straight playboy who, at one point, pretends to be gay to hoodwink Day.
Minghella says that in addition to looking again at "Vertigo" and contemporaneous Fellini movies (particularly his favorite, "I Vitelloni") in preparing "Ripley," he helped nail down the young American characters' cultural and sexual milieu by reading memoirs by Paul Goodman and Paul Monette. He also consulted Calvin Trillin's remorseful "Remembering Denny," about Trillin's Yale '57 classmate Denny Hansen, a closeted gay varsity athlete, an "all-American hero" with a "million-dollar smile," who traveled to Europe as a Rhodes scholar (and much later committed suicide).
Yet the larger American themes of "The Talented Mr. Ripley," sounded by Ripley's relentless mission to reinvent himself along the lines of his gaudiest dreams, transcend the movie's particular time and place. Both as written initially by Highsmith and then expanded by Minghella, what might have been a narrow thriller seems like a mordant recap of a classic, perhaps the classic, strain in American literature and social history.
The writer and psychoanalyst Robert Jay Lifton summed up this durable strain in his 1993 book, "The Protean Self." Calling America "the protean nation," he traces our infatuation with the legends of self-invented men from the multilived Benjamin Franklin ("America's quintessential 'self-made man"') through to such less benign, mythical con men as James Fenimore Cooper's Richard Jones (in "The Pioneers," 1823) and Melville's nameless "Confidence Man" with his "shell-game of identity" (1857) to our century's foremost embodiment of the archetype, Fitzgerald's Jay Gatsby of 1925 ("a crook as well as a dreamer"). As one modern master of the theme, Ralph Ellison, put it, America's capacity for the protean reflects the country's "rich diversity and its almost magical fluidity and freedom" and yet also "illusion which must be challenged, as Menelaus did in seizing Proteus."
Minghella talks affectionately about American writers from Wharton and James to Tennessee Williams and Raymond Carver. But the biggest influence on his "Ripley" screenplay seems to be one he didn't mention: Fitzgerald. In Minghella's screenplay, whether intentionally or not, the continuity between "Ripley" and "The Great Gatsby" is pronounced. The screenplay gives Dickie Greenleaf a more callous present and a violent past not in Highsmith, to the point where this scion of a wealthy family seems a stand-in for Fitzgerald's Tom Buchanan, the rich Yale football hero, and his wife, Daisy, who famously "smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness." As the aristocratic Tom Buchanan is less appealing in the end than the parvenu racketeer Gatsby, so the aristocratic Dickie, a reckless man without the saving grace of romantic ambition, seems in some ways less admirable than the impostor Tom Ripley.
And Ripley is an unmistakable descendant of Gatsby, that "penniless young man without a past" who will stop at nothing to will his romantic idol, Daisy, into believing he is of her class. ("I didn't want you to think I was just some nobody," Gatsby says at one point, sounding like Ripley in his pursuit of Dickie.) By making Ripley not just a fraudulent Princetonian but also a men's room menial -- a detail not in Highsmith's book -- Minghella heightens the parallel to Gatsby, who invoked an Oxford pedigree to cloak his humble past as James Gatz, once a janitor. For much of the way, especially given the empathy and intelligence with which Damon laces (and yet never sentimentalizes) a spooky role, it is possible to admire Ripley as "talented" in the way that Fitzgerald saw Gatsby as "great" -- as a grand dreamer with the creative vision to make something of himself. They might have been the kind of dreamers who have always built America, had they not overreached.
The brilliance of Highsmith's conception of Tom Ripley was her ability to keep the heroic and demonic American dreamer in balance in the same protagonist -- thus keeping us on his side well after his behavior becomes far more sociopathic than that of a con man like Gatsby (even allowing for the rumors that Gatsby had "killed a man once"). The attractive Gatsby side of Tom, so well augmented by Minghella and Damon, fights to a standoff with the darker Tom, who seems almost to have been yanked from the Theodore Dreiser novel published the same year as "Gatsby," "An American Tragedy." Dreiser's striving Horatio Alger-style hero, Clyde Griffiths, is so determined to wipe out his past -- and to win the society girl that is his equivalent to Daisy and Dickie -- that he literally jettisons his human baggage, his working-class mistress, in a lake. One of the most shocking scenes in "Ripley" (novel and film) is a variation on that incident, which Dreiser had in fact borrowed from a notorious real-life American murder of 1906.
Whether Highsmith was thinking of Dreiser in writing either "Strangers on a Train" (which also echoes "An American Tragedy") or "Ripley" is unknown. She might also, one imagines, have read Willa Cather's early story "Paul's Case," an uncanny literary antecedent of "Ripley" also dating back to the beginning of the century (1905), in which a dreamy boy who works as an usher at Carnegie Hall in Pittsburgh aspires to a life he has gleaned from "the supper-party pictures of The Sunday World supplement." With ill-gotten gains, he runs away to New York, where, much as Ripley hightails it to Gucci and the Grand Hotel in Rome, he shops at Tiffany and ogles the "bewildering radiance" of the fixtures at the grand hotel where he obtains a room. "He was exactly the kind of boy he had always wanted to be," wrote Cather of her reinvented hero. "This was what all the struggle was about. He doubted the reality of his past" -- especially "now that he could, as his actor friends used to say, 'dress the part."' But the only way Paul can really wipe out his past, in Cather's moral scheme, is to kill himself.
By Ripley's debut in 1955, suicide, like the electrocution of Clyde Griffiths or the shooting of Jay Gatsby, was no longer the inevitable outcome for a man (or woman) who went to extremes in pursuit of erasing the past for a new life. It was the era of the Beats and anti-heroes and also of a new mainstream critique of the American "success" story, typified by nonfiction books like "The Affluent Society" (1958), by John Kenneth Galbraith, and "The Status Seekers" (1959), by Vance Packard, which raised questions about the postwar boom's version of the American dream not unlike those Dreiser did a half-century earlier, in the aftermath of the Gilded Age. Typical of the mood was Joseph L. Mankiewicz's uncompromisingly cynical screenplay for the hit 1950 movie "All About Eve," in which the self-made young actress Eve Harrington turns out not to be the poor, nave war widow of her self-generated publicity but a back-stabbing sexual predator and compulsive liar whose real name is Gertrude Slescynski. Her unmasking, however, does not impede her meteoric rise to stardom.
A half-century later still, Ripleys seem almost a constant on the national landscape -- the real-life landscape as well as that of our culture. Outlaw protean Americans have always thrived in prosperous times like Fitzgerald's 20's and Highsmith's 50's -- and in the gold-rush frontier before that -- when success seems to be everywhere and in such tantalizing reach. Our twin economic peaks of the 80's and 90's have produced a share of characters who could have walked right out of the pages of a Highsmith novel.
In the early 80's, a young man named David Hampton bamboozled some of the toniest households on the Upper East Side into believing he was Sidney Poitier's son -- in part by persuading them that he had been a classmate of their children's at various elite schools. (In John Guare's fictionalized stage version of the story, "Six Degrees of Separation," the impostor learns how to fake his identity by having an affair with a male Ivy League undergrad -- a tactic that Ripley also uses, in bowdlerized form, in Highsmith's novel.) The 80's also brought us newly minted masters of the universe, Gatsbys who, if not caught, might have become Ripleys: the inside trader Ivan Boesky, who used his membership in the Harvard Club to trick business colleagues into believing he was from a highfalutin background (he actually drifted through several undistinguished colleges in Michigan), and Jeffrey P. Beck, the Drexel mergers-and-acquisitions maniac known as Mad Dog. Beck was so convincing that he befriended Michael Douglas and served as an adviser and bit player for the Oliver Stone film "Wall Street." Only after the crash was it discovered that Beck's legendary tales of derring-do in the Vietnam War and clandestine adventures with the C.I.A. were fiction.
Our current boom has created not just self-invented New Economy pinups like Jim Clark but also the likes of Martin Frankel, who, with the right lies, Greenwich, Conn., estate and impressive computer consoles, passed himself off as a financial genius while supposedly stealing hundreds of millions of dollars from U.S. insurance companies. Though he was a gawky, bespectacled high-school dropout and so neurotic that he suffered from "traders' block," he somehow convinced his prey, as well as the many women he attracted to his harem, that he was a brilliant stock speculator and world-class sybarite. Even when he was on the run in Europe, fleeing an international manhunt, he traveled first-class, with luggage tonnage to match. Once he was finally apprehended, one of his gal pals, Cynthia Allison, told Time that Frankel only wanted to live the American dream.
The same could be said of Andrew Cunanan, a young man who apparently struck many as no less charming than Ripley. He convinced a variety of well-educated prey that he was an intelligence officer, a graduate of Choate and Yale and the son of Philippine plantation owners as he traded socially upward, reinventing himself at each step, in his long and bloody path toward a rendezvous with Gianni Versace. Once Cunanan killed himself, the Miami Beach police found a well-thumbed library of tasteful self-improvement that he had left behind: H.W. Janson's "History of Art," a Francis Bacon coffee-table book and biographies of Conde Nast, Slim Keith and William Paley. This could have been Ripley's upwardly mobile reading list -- or items on the self-improvement checklist kept by the young James Gatz. (Martin Frankel also kept a list, found after his capture, the first item on which was "launder money.")
Minghella calls "The Talented Mr. Ripley" a "mischievous morality tale" because it's designed to force the audience to wonder how far it might take reinvention in pursuit of some prize, whether it be success or love or simply an antidote to an acute loneliness. The movie is meant to instill "the queasy recognition that this plausible misfit is not so far from one version of ourselves," Minghella writes in an introduction to the soon-to-be-published version of his screenplay. The filmmaker wants each of us "to inhabit each step of Ripley's journey until, like a child in the sea who has forgotten the tide, we look back and see how perilously far we are from the shore."
By then, blood is washing up with the tide, and how many will want to take that journey is anybody's guess. Damon applauds Minghella's decision to make Ripley a realistic, human, at times touching character rather than a Hannibal Lecter sort of psychopath, even though Minghella knew going in that, commercially, a Lecter approach "would have been better -- it's not rocket science." Like his star, Minghella wouldn't have had it any other way, but he knows he could pay a price. "I feel as shameless as Ripley," he told me as he was completing his final cut. "When you're making a film, you want it to be as unique and distinctive and resonant as you can make it. When you're out in the cinema, you want it to be like every film that is working -- faster, funnier, more romantic. You become the biggest slut in the world. I thought 10 people would show up for 'The English Patient' -- it was about this man who's severely burned and he's in bed and telling stories to a French-Canadian nurse! I think 10 other people will show up for 'Ripley.' I have no acumen about the movie business. I hope I'm wrong again. I can't imagine the film sustaining that number of screens" -- it opens at more than 2,000 theaters -- but I know there's a huge audience out there for Gwyneth and Matt. I hope they're surprised and delighted, not surprised and dismayed."
But dismayed isn't necessarily a bad thing. In a year when even Hollywood movies that offer critiques of America tend to congratulate the audience on its superiority to the characters on-screen -- witness the pitiful suburban couples of "American Beauty" -- The Talented Mr. Ripley" implicates the moviegoer. There's something about Ripley, in both his desire for a better life and his eagerness to discard the unhappy past, that is built into the American character, most alluringly so, and we live in a time when, more than ever, a new life is plausible. The America at the end of our century -- more than even the America at the end of the last, another fast-moving time of industrial revolution and melting-pot immigration -- is agog with technological change that not only encourages us to reinvent ourselves to find success or happiness or sex but also increases the tools with which we can do so and the social mobility that encourages us to go for it. "Reinvent Yourself" instructs a story in a telephone-directory-thick issue of Fast Company, the wildly successful booster magazine of the new economy, as it preaches the lessons in metamorphosis gleaned from, among others, a prosecutor who became a video-game producer and a jazz musician who remade himself into a management consultant.
We don't even have to show our faces to reinvent ourselves. In a chat room, anyone can be a Ripley -- or whoever. It's a liberating time in the history of a protean nation, and also a conflicting one. "The American is always on the way to someplace else," Lewis Lapham once wrote, but perhaps never as quickly or universally as in the high-velocity world of right now. While Ripley has to laboriously scratch out a passport photo to trade in an identity, we can do it in a digital click. But where do we want to go today? Who do we want to be? How much of ourselves (and family and friends and values) are we willing to trade away, in the name of self-improvement and ambition of one kind or another, to get there?
No one, it seems, is immune to these questions. In the library rotunda of the $100 million mansion he built near Seattle, Bill Gates has inscribed not a triumphal captain-of-industry epigram but a yearning quotation from, of all books, "The Great Gatsby." At the turn of our century, even the man by whom most Americans measure success finds romance in a mythic charlatan who rubbed out his past, then built a fortune and a mansion, all in the mistaken faith that he could find happiness by being someone else.

HEADLINE: Outside Baltimore, a Reach Back to the 19th Century

BYLINE: By CHARLES BELFOURE

DATELINE: ELLICOTT CITY, Md.

 BODY:
A small residential subdivision nearing completion in this Howard County community is the first in the Baltimore metropolitan area to use a new land planning method that is actually a throwback to late 19th- and early 20th-century suburban neighborhood designs.
Terra Maria, a 55-acre, 102-house development 14 miles west of downtown Baltimore, is a neo-traditional neighborhood based on century-old planning principles. 
 Beginning in the late 1980's, urban planners and architects sought to create residential communities different from the usual cul-de-sac subdivisions used since World War II. These developments are characterized by porch-fronted houses on small lots lining narrow streets and within walking distance of parks, stores and schools.
The Terra Maria site was once part of a 253-acre landholding owned by Charles Carroll of Carrollton, a signer of the Declaration of Independence. Before his death in 1832, Carroll, a Roman Catholic, was persuaded to give the land to the Archdiocese of Baltimore for the construction of a high school for young men considering entering the priesthood.
Named St. Charles College in honor of its benefactor, the school grew into a large campus, but in 1911 it burned down, leaving only the shell of a recreation hall. Over the years, the land passed through several owners and, among other things, was used for an evangelical camp. In 1978, the remaining acreage was purchased by Robert and Donna Lancelotta, who named it Terra Maria, the Latin translation of Maryland.
Their son, Robert Lancelotta Jr., came up with the idea of creating a neo-traditional development. In the early 90's, he had read about the pioneering traditional neighborhood design work of Andres Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk, Miami-based architects who created such nationally known projects as Seaside, in the Florida panhandle near Panama City, and Kentlands in Gaithersburg, Md., just outside Washington.
Another inspiration came from a group of estate buildings in front of Carroll's manor house, all of which survive directly across the road. "I wanted to create the same village-like feel for the development," said the younger Lancelotta.
Mr. Duany visited the site and did some conceptual work, but eventually the project was turned over to Uri Avin, a principal of LDR International, a land planning firm based in Columbia, Md. The goal of Mr. Avin, who created a new site plan in 1993, was to create an intimate streetscape with sidewalks, a community center and open spaces and to include a mix of uses such as a day-care center, professional offices, and retail space.
In neo-traditional work, one of the main trade-offs is using small lots in place of the usual one- or half-acre parcels to preserve more of the natural features of the site and have public space.
"We have a background of tall, mature trees and each sub-area of homes has its own greenspace as well as a main one for the community," explained Mr. Avin. One of the open areas incorporates the ruins of the recreation hall, which was preserved by the Lancelotta family.
Another important tenet of neo-traditional work that was included in Terra Maria was the de-emphasis of the automobile. Some garages are either off alleys behind the houses or accessed by driveways and pushed to the rear of the lot in order to avoid a subdivision look.
Street widths in Terra Maria were reduced from a standard 26 feet to 18 feet to reduce traffic speed and also cut paving costs. Because of smaller lot sizes, the cost of laying utility lines was significantly less.
Terra Maria turned out to be more of a hybrid than a true neo-traditional project because of its lack of mixed uses. A parcel fronting on Frederick Road was originally scheduled to be a small retail center with apartments above. But that proved economically unfeasible, so the lot was rezoned for a day-care center with professional offices on the second floor.
The Lancelottas teamed with Synergy Development Venture II, a land development company based in Baltimore that became the managing member of Terra Maria L.L.C. The development company sold the lots to individual builders who in turn sold the land and houses beginning in January 1997.
Because Terra Maria is the first development to be based on a neo-traditional model in suburban Baltimore, many builders and developers are looking at its sales results to gauge the market's acceptance of the concept.
Although all 102 lots are sold, according to David DeMauro of Synergy, "it was a hard sell." The main problem, he explained, was that a buyer could purchase a house on a 6,000 to 12,000 square foot lot in Terra Maria or go within a five-mile radius and get a home for the same price on about a half-acre lot, the equivalent of 21,780 square feet. Given the choice, many would opt for more land over a sense of community.
Prices for a 3,000- to 3,500-square-foot home in Terra Maria, including the lot, originally ranged from $300,000 to $450,000. But the four builders in the first phase sold a total of just 16 houses in the first year and prices were later reduced. For the second and last phase, however, Ryland Homes, Baltimore's second biggest residential builder, decided to reduce the price range to $250,000 to $300,000 for homes on its 40 lots and sales were considerably brisker, said Earl Robinson, sales and marketing manager. "We loved the concept and would definitely do something like this again," he said.
Besides the issue of price, the concept of the higher density of a neo-traditional community was initially a stumbling block. Many potential buyers thought it would be overcrowded. "But once the development was 50 percent built," said Mr. DeMauro of Synergy, "people could see what we were doing and were sold on the idea. Sales have been very good since then." He said, however, that sales in a normal subdivision would have been faster.
Ben Sander, who became one of the first homeowners in 1997, was immediately attracted to Terra Maria because it reminded him of the charm and character of a historic community in which he had lived in Northville, Mich. "A normal subdivision is very sterile compared to this," he said.
One problem, said Mr. DeMauro, was that some builders did not have the right product for this different type of development and also were not used to the strict architectural guidelines they had to follow, such as using certain types of brick and wood instead of vinyl.
Gary Clarke of the GYC Group in Westminster, Md., who built five homes in Terra Maria, had to create a different design than what he normally used. "The houses had to be narrower and deeper to fit on the lots," said Mr. Clarke.
Joseph Rutter, director of planning and zoning for Howard County, said that his flexible policy on such things as setbacks, lot coverage and density promoted projects like Terra Maria. A much larger neo-traditional community of 500 acres called Maple Lawn Farms, which was designed by Mr. Avin and will be developed by Greenebaum & Rose, based in Baltimore, is currently under review in Howard County and Mr. Rutter is confident it will go forward.
The younger Mr. Lancelotta believes that neo-traditional developments will become more common in the future, but it will happen slowly. "People say, 'I have to have my land,' but land is becoming precious and we have to forgo large lots," he explained. "Aesthetically and socially, neo-traditional is a better plan."

HEADLINE: ART/ARCHITECTURE;
In an Indoor Age, the Streets Remain His Studio

BYLINE: By RICHARD B. WOODWARD; Richard B. Woodward is editor-at-large for "DoubleTake," a literary and photographic magazine.

 BODY:
DAIDO MORIYAMA was everywhere in New York this fall. The subject of exhibitions at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Japan Society and the Laurence Miller Gallery; of a handsome catalog on his life and work (from the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art), and of essays in prominent art magazines, he has enjoyed a scholarly star treatment unprecedented for a Japanese photographer in this country. The reviews were mainly raves.
Given the 61-year-old Mr. Moriyama's acknowledged debts to American artists, especially to William Klein's confrontational camera and Andy Warhol's acrid, Pop sensibility, this belated recognition is as instructive as it is overdue. 
 Against the background of photography seen in New York galleries and museums these days, his work can look simultaneously at home and estranged. His indifference to certain technical niceties places him squarely in the sector of the art world that has always distrusted perfect prints. His are often over- or underexposed, blurred or scratched, as if stored in piles under a bed.
His means of making pictures, however, as well as his prowling, scavenger eye put him at odds with the controlled, intimate mood that has dominated photographic practice for the last decade. He shoots black and white, mainly with a hand-held camera, and until recently made small-scale prints.
An impersonal artist who finds his gritty matter in the world at large, he has stalked the Japanese for more than three decades and photographed this most homogeneous of nations as if it were populated entirely by outcasts and freaks. He is at heart a street photographer, and as an active proponent of this once-vital style -- one that is now all but invisible in New York galleries -- he can appear to be an alien twice over.
Popping up now from the other side of the globe, he looks like something of a relic, and his career is cause to reflect on the strange fate of the street-documentary style over the last 25 years.
In 1974, when Mr. Moriyama was first featured in New York, in a group show on "New Japanese Photography" at the Museum of Modern Art, he did not seem so out of place. His links to older Japanese figures like Shomei Tomatsu, and his breaks from them, were made clear, and his jaundiced vision of the city as a 24-hour comic nightmare, akin to Weegee's and Mr. Klein's, locked him into the American zeitgeist.
These were the years when Garry Winogrand, Lee Friedlander and their allies were remaking the photographic image into a more fractured and tenuous but still coherent thing. Robert Frank's "The Americans" was the Bible -- proof, said Mr. Winogrand, "you could photograph anywhere." There was a hunger to devour the world and a faith that this could best be done with a hand-held Leica and a wide-angle lens.
The anarchic joy that pulsed from Mr. Winogrand's raucous images of New York in the 60's and 70's persuaded a generation to stand at Fifty-Seventh Street and Fifth Avenue, where it seemed everything worth photographing was passing by or soon would be.
Today it's not only faith in this quixotic illusion that now seems dead. New York's street life ceased to hold the attention of young photographers well over 10 years ago; indeed, the appetite to hunt for pictures on the streets anywhere -- or in the wider world beyond the studio or the home -- has sharply declined.
The inward-looking tendency of art photography in the late 80's, summed up well by the Museum of Modern Art's 1991 group exhibition "The Pleasures and Terrors of Domestic Comfort," is even more pronounced today. Artists have portrayed their friends, families and themselves with abandon throughout the 90's. Just as the memoir has challenged the novel as the narrative of choice for young writers, so have the hermetic documentary and self-dramatics supplanted more expansive forms of address in photography.
The latest photography that emerges from art schools and that finds a place in galleries and museums is predominantly studio-based, theatrical in orientation and shot in color with large-format cameras. If Mr. Frank, Mr. Winogrand and Mr. Friedlander were guiding lights for their peers a quarter-century ago, their counterparts today would be Cindy Sherman, Nan Goldin and Sally Mann.
"The street is almost totally absent in the new work that comes in here and that I see in galleries," said Jeff Rosenheim, assistant curator in the department of photographs at the Metropolitan Museum. "The studio is all-powerful. It's all about the self."
The many reasons for this change of voice, from public to private, range from the ubiquity of television, which has assumed the former role of photography as eyewitness, to the economic imperative of making big prints for cavernous gallery rooms.
"People bring me documentary street work all the time," said the Los Angeles photography dealer Paul Kopeikin. "I don't think it has completely died out. But no one is buying it, so I can't really show it."
The triumph of postmodern ideology, which undercuts the neutral ground of the observer, is also responsible. "Political correctness has killed off documentary in general," said Sandra Phillips, senior curator at San Francisco's Museum of Modern Art. "There's an inhibition now about photographing strangers anywhere." Passersby are also far less willing than they once were to be passive vehicles for a someone else's vision of them: photographers who work in the street face suspicion or hostility.
Many artists, including Tina Barney, Jeff Wall and Philip-Lorca diCorcia, have fuzzed the line between a documentary photograph and a tableau as one way to drive a stake through the heart of idealist categories.
"Documentary itself is an empty notion for a lot of artists," said Anne Tucker, curator of photography at Houston's Museum of Fine Arts. "Photographing a guy being mugged, or photographing a guy being mugged on television or staging a guy being mugged are now the same. Distinctions between what is reality and what is media have become so blurred they're meaningless for the purposes of many photographers. Everything is open to question, including what's 'out there.' "
The in-your-face style practiced by Mr. Moriyama and his American and European counterparts during the 60's and 70's also tended to exclude women.
Lisette Model and Diane Arbus worked for long periods as flaneurs, but Helen Levitt is perhaps the only American woman to have spent a lifetime photographing in the streets. "It's an aggressive act pointing a camera in someone's face," said Ms. Phillips, who noted that Mr. Winogrand and his crew of male friends called themselves "the pack"
The one arena where the macho street aesthetic seems to have survived, and perhaps thrived, is in war photography. "Gilles Peress is a prime example of someone who has taken the techniques of street photography and applied them to world events," says Colin Westerbeck, co-author of "Bystander: A History of Street Photography" and associate curator of photography at the Art Institute of Chicago. "War and everyday life have merged in countries like Iran, Nicaragua, Bosnia and Kosovo." Everywhere he looks Mr. Peress seems to come upon the kind of sad, loony, surreal juxtapositions that Mr. Cartier-Bresson found in Mexico and Mr. Winogrand in New York.
There are other defenders of the faith as well. Mr. Friedlander, Tod Papageorge and Leo Rubenfien are still clicking away on city streets around the globe. Thomas Roma and Sylvia Plachy still patrol Brooklyn and Manhattan. Mitch Epstein's show of huge color prints this fall at Brent Sikkema in Chelsea even featured one of a woman lighting a cigarette for a stranger along Fifth Avenue. "It was my way of making a Winogrand picture," says Mr. Epstein. But the death early this year of the Indian photographer Ragubhir Singh further diminished the ranks of first-rate artists who find material simply by walking or driving around.
The large-format camera, the tool of choice for many young, ambitious photographers, thwarts spontaneity and offhand observations. The German artist Thomas Struth, who often blurs the action in his pictures, is nonetheless in the business of producing monumental prints with the richness of old-master paintings. The streets in his book called "Streets" were eerily empty. The excitement of discovering things on the fly is missing.
Even Mr. diCorcia's celebrated photographs of people on sidewalks are composed with stage-set lighting. The pictures seem to illustrate the point that Tokyo and New York and Berlin are now one place; they're less about detecting some hidden vitality that would be unknown without his photographs. It's as if he knew what he wanted to say before he made the picture.
In the decade of globalization and cyberspace, when people interact more with their computer screens than with each other on street corners, it makes sense that photographers find private musings and fantasies more relevant than a crowd of shoppers at Home Depot. As the photographer Joel Sternfeld complains, "It's also much harder to make interesting pictures in a mall culture, in a McDonald's or a Starbuck's."
The absence of street life, along with the more widespread dismissal of documentary practice from art school curriculums, however, feels like an impoverishment of our visual history.
"Students don't realize that in 5 to 10 years the world is going to change again," Mr. Sternfeld said. "What is omnipresent now may be rare in the future, and a clear, sharp picture of the present is going to be intrinsically interesting."
The simple and, in some ways, unglamorous act of photographing people and events, unarmed by art theory, has lost its value in the art market and in schools. The photographer Justin Kimball, who has taught at the Rhode Island School of Design, said: "It's hard to convince students to go out into the world anymore. They all want to just stay in their rooms and photograph their stuff."
Mr. Moriyama's pictures, however occult or halting in articulation, point outward at the world, as if he were groping to explain his native country to himself after postwar assaults by the West. In a shrewd essay on Mr. Moriyama in the October issue of Art in America, Mr. Rubenfien observed: "His Japan has fully absorbed the American virus into its own chemistry, and while a Japanese might hate this condition, there is no possibility of reversing it."
Feeling doomed, even disgusted, by what he sees happening around him -- in stores and backyards, on highways and in karaoke bars -- he has tried not to withdraw and to remain engaged with his culture, fashioning his own code of distress signals about his permanent alienation. His career and life demonstrate a rare kind of bravery. One might say that Mr. Moriyama is a documentary photographer in spite of himself.

HEADLINE: Around Orlando, A Sharper Focus On Downtowns

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
ONCE Muriel Hogan decided two years ago that she wanted to leave Arlington, Tex., she had another decision to make -- where to go. Originally a Midwesterner, she was working at home for a California-based association that runs conventions and meetings for the electronic publishing industry. "I could have gone to live anywhere I wanted to," Ms. Hogan said.
She chose the Orlando area in central Florida. "I had taken a lot of business trips and the Orlando area was my favorite," she said. 
 So in July 1997 Ms. Hogan and her 15-year-old daughter, Morgan Turner, rented an apartment in Altamonte Springs, 12 miles north of Orlando.
Now they are living in a two-bedroom rental apartment in Celebration, the four-year-old Disney Company development that looks like and in some ways functions as a contemporary idealization of the American small town. They are on a waiting list for a $170,000 bungalow home in the newest section under development, South Village, expecting to be able to go into contract next spring and move in during the summer.
"It reminds me of the small town I was brought up in -- Barrington, in Illinois," Ms. Hogan said. "You know the other residents. They stop and talk to you. It's a hometown atmosphere that focuses on the downtown."
From the standpoint of the developer of Celebration, no more gratifying words could be uttered. Its downtown is visually and psychologically the heart of Celebration, making it look older and more established than other Florida developments in their pre-adolescent years. Disney World and other theme parks that have been major engines of Celebration's growth -- and the growth of more conventional residential communities in the vicinity -- are only a few miles away.
But Celebration is not alone in the greater Orlando area in capitalizing on an attractive commercial downtown core to complement and stimulate residential development. The central cores are helping to sell houses to buyers from afar, coming to a region that has gained an international profile, and a large new employment base, through its recreational attractions.
Fifty-five miles northwest of Orlando, at a sprawling and still growing 13-year-old retirement community called the Villages of Lady Lake, a new but old-looking downtown emerged full blown only four years ago.
"We used some of the tricks we learned at the theme parks," said Steven C. Rhys, a principal in Forrec Ltd. of Toronto, master planner for the Universal Studios theme park in Orlando and the Villages' choice to design the downtown square. It has a 19th-century Spanish-American look, with an artesian well bubbling up from a central square to evoke Ponce de Leon's quest for the fountain of youth.
Today that 16th-century explorer would find a church, a bank, the post office, a hotel, restaurants, movie theaters, a bakery, a bowling alley and the offices of a newspaper, the Daily Sun. The busiest place in town seems to be the visitors' center and sales office. The supermarket is 100 yards away in a conventional shopping center. There are cars and open tour trolleys on the streets, but many residents buzz around in golf carts.
What the developers brought into being at Celebration and the Villages emerged naturally over time in two other communities that have attracted buyers to the region in recent years. One is Mount Dora, a leafy, long-established resort town on a hill overlooking Lake Dora. The other is Deland, in western Volusia County, almost halfway to the oceanside city of Daytona. Deland earned a Great American Main Street award in 1997 from the Washington-based National Trust for Historic Preservation, which annually presents five such awards to communities across the country.
"We are seeing a national rebirth of traditional town centers," said Jim Constantine, a partner in the Princeton, N.J., office of Looney Ricks Kiss, a national design and planning firm based in Memphis. The new centers have a blend of curbside and offstreet parking, a variety of Main Street storefronts, and, quite often, new housing within walking distance of commercial and office space.
Celebration's downtown is a tourist attraction, and builders say it has been a notable benefit to home sales. "Normally we see about 25 people a week in one of our sales offices," said John Rymer, vice president for sales and marketing of Morrison Homes of Atlanta, which is developing 70 residential communities across the Sun Belt. "At Celebration it is not unusual to see 100 a day, 25 percent of them European sightseers."
Celebration's downtown business district, just off Route 192 and a half hour by car from downtown Orlando, is at the heart of a completed section called the Village Center. It has 350 housing units of various types, most of them tightly clustered on traditional streets, with front or side porches and rear garages.
But this is only a small portion of the 4,900-acre site, which so far is only 30 percent complete or under development. The business district captures a certain enchantment at night because of a well-lit lakefront along Front Street and open stores and restaurants on uncrowded commercial streets, the whole as pleasant to the eye as a stage set.
ULTIMATELY there are to be 12,000 to 15,000 residents at Celebration. The majority of new houses are single-families selling in the $250,000 to $350,000 price range, although there are also custom houses selling for up to $800,000 or more, and town houses starting at $180,000.
"We had only 70 town houses in the initial phase of development," said Matthew E. Kelly, vice president for real estate development and operations, "but they sold extremely well so we added more of them to the mix."
Linda Goodwin, who runs Goodwin Realty in Kissimmee, Fla., said that the resale market at Celebration is in its infancy, but that based on 20 resales over a 16-month period, the prices of existing homes appear to have appreciated by about 10 to 12 percent. That is a sign of market strength, since buyers can also choose a new, never-occupied house. "Usually when you compete with a builder your appreciation level is pretty straight-line," Ms. Goodwin said.
The downtown theme is by no means exploited universally in the growth districts around Orlando. In the Clermont area, 25 miles due west of the city, rapid residential growth has turned Route 50 into a billboard alley for new developments.
Home buyers can choose a "gated community on Lake Minnehaha" (Osprey Pointe), or "chateau condominiums" (Magnolia Pointe) or "active adult living" (Summit Greens). For the most part, the land is still barren as site preparation proceeds in advance of home construction. Commercial facilities are rarely incorporated into the planning for these projects.
Lennar Homes, the largest home builder in Florida, got ahead of the pack in the area when it started building the adult community of Kings Ridge in Clermont in 1995. The site is off Route 27, a major north-south spine that was largely hinterlands at the time. Now there are 850 homes, and in a few years there are to be about 3,000 on the 925 acres of land. A 25,000-square-foot clubhouse was completed two years ago.
Bing Hacker, president of Lennar's Clermont division, said that about half the Kings Ridge buyers originally came from the Middle West, and that 60 percent of all buyers had most recently been living in Florida.
A business-oriented downtown is not for Kings Ridge. "We have a neighborhood of single-family homes with yards," Mr. Hacker said. "There are malls and small strip centers within two miles. Our residents would be very upset if these were within the development itself." Home prices range from the mid-$80,000's to about $150,000 for houses on lots of 4,000 to 6,000 square feet.
Even pre-Disney, builders say, the Route 27 corridor in central Florida attracted development for retirees. Many live in Lake County. The largest community there is the Villages of Lady Lake, which began as a mobile home park in the 70's and now embraces 9,500 acres of land across three counties -- Lake, Sumter and Marion. The developers are Harold Schwartz, formerly a Chicago advertising executive, and his son, Gary Morse.
There were already 12,000 residents at the Villages when Mr. Morse approached Forrec, the Toronto firm, to create a town center. It has nine square blocks, with a town square in the middle. The pastel-colored stucco facades, white pilasters and second-level balconies of the commercial buildings give the town center its Spanish-American village look.
"All four sides of the buildings were given this architectural treatment, so you don't feel like a second-class citizen if you have to park in one of the lots behind the buildings," said Mr. Rhys of Forrec.
The Village Center is established as a "community development district" with an administrator, Pete Wahl. The district owns and operates the water and waste-water system of the retirement community and unincorporated villages nearby, and takes care of the maintenance of common space and security for the retirement community. It also operates the Villages' nine golf courses.
With a population of 22,000 and a sales pace of 1,200 to 1,400 houses a year, the Villages is one of the fastest growing retirement communities in Florida. New houses are built in a series of separate neighborhoods, each with its own recreation facilities. There are 90 models, and they sell in a price range of $63,000 to $309,000. The fastest-selling homes are in a category with 14 styles and interior space of 1,900 square feet to 2,700 square feet, priced from $106,000 to $139,000.
Since the completion of the downtown three years ago home sales have accelerated, said Gary Lester, who is vice president for community relations and one of the Village's 1,600 full-time or part-time employees. Only three or four years ago, annual home sales were running at a pace of about 700.
The leisured life style appeals to Donald Mosure, a retiree in his late 50's from Fort Wayne, Ind. He and his wife, Kay, participate in a multitude of activities, he said, and he also drives visitors around the downtown on its trolley bus. Residents usually get around on golf carts, Mr. Mosure said. "Most communities don't allow them on the main streets, but here they do," he said.
No golf carts are in sight in Mount Dora, a traditional town that would look in place in the North. Along with Eustis and Taveres, it is one of three in the immediate area on the chain of lakes that give the county its name.
One of its historic buildings is the 88-room Lakeside Inn, which opened in 1883, later expanded, and was a winter nesting place for Calvin Coolidge and his wife. It was upgraded by new owners in this decade. The town also has arts festivals, antiques and flower shows, and boat regattas, and the Mount Dora Theater Company, playing at a converted building named the Icehouse Theater.
Samuel S. Sadler III, a fourth-generation Mount Dora resident, is a custom-home builder, selling in a price range of $200,000 to $500,000. Half his customers are second-home buyers, he said. His 32-lot Dogwood Mountain subdivision off Old Eustis Road offers home buyers views of distant hills.
LAKE COUNTY used to be a leading citrus county, Mr. Sadler noted, and Mount Dora had many of the packing houses. Most of them closed after the freezes at the orange groves in 1983 and 1985. "The whole scenario changed around here," Mr. Sadler said. "Land went from citrus to residential. The Big Boys moved in -- Ryan Homes, Centex, Bovis. Local contractors are being displaced by the big companies."
The largest of the new projects currently under way is the Country Club of Mount Dora, one of the eight communities in the Orlando area that Morrison Homes is building. The stucco homes sell for $110,000 to $260,000 and there is a 10,000-square-foot clubhouse. Two-thirds of the buyers are retirees, the company says. When completed, there will be 660 homes; 70 percent are already built, sold and occupied. The 440-acre site is just east of town, off Route 441.
Most sales in Mount Dora are resales of existing houses, however, and there have been 3,400 resales so far this year, said Marilyn Hottle, who owns Coldwell Banker Camelot Realty. The average price is $126,000, which would get a buyer a 2,000-square-foot house on a quarter-acre lot, usually in a neighborhood built within the last 20 years, she said.
"About 40 percent of the buyers are from the Northeast, and a lot come from South Florida," Ms. Hottle said. "We're known as the New England of Florida."
In Deland, a city of 18,000 in western Volusia County, and the home of the 100-year-old Stetson University, a $2.5 million streetscape program has given a boost to an old commercial center. Electric wiring has gone underground on main streets, sidewalks have been rebuilt, and at five key intersections there is colorful new textured-concrete paving. At Sam's Menswear and Tailor Shop, Sam Chiarelli, who started the business with his wife six years ago on a side street, said that retail vacancies stood at 20 percent when he moved into his current store on North Woodland Boulevard three years ago. "Now you can't find a store available," he said.
Most of the newer growth is outside the city limits, and with the Orlando bedroom community of Deltona to the south beginning to fill up, large-scale growth is beginning to reach the southeast quadrant of Deland, developers say.
Next year the Arvida Corporation of Boca Raton is scheduled to start construction of Victoria Park, a 10-year project that will produce 4,000 housing units on 1,800 acres off Orange Camp Road, near Interstate 4. "All the lots have been sold in Deltona," said John S. Chinelli, a Deland land developer and broker, "so now they're coming over here."
Wherever home builders have launched their longterm site developments, they have grown accustomed to paying impact fees to local or county jurisdictions to cover the new public investment in schools, roads or other facilities that growth brings on. These costs are passed on to home buyers. Orange County, which embraces the city of Orlando, was one of the first in the country to adopt impact fees in the 80's, and the practice has spread to surrounding counties.
According to the Florida Home Builders Association, based in Tallahassee, county impact fees average $8,483 for new houses in Orange County, which embraces Orlando, and $8,234 a house in nearby Osceola County. In Lake County they average $2,347 a house. Often there are municipal fees on top of the county fees. In Lake County, municipal water and sewer fees raise the total burden on new buyers to $6,000 to $8,000 for the average house.
HOME builders estimate that new production is about 20,000 houses built and sold a year by roughly 50 companies in the two counties where Disney is active --Orange and Osceola -- plus nearby Seminole, Lake and Volusia counties.
One company, the Greater Construction Corporation, in Altamonte Springs, is building at six locations within 40 miles of Orlando and plans to start three more communities next year, according to Robert A. Mandell, its chairman.
Half of Greater Construction's sales of 425 houses this year have been to people living outside Florida, Mr. Mandell said, often to offshore companies or individuals, mostly British, buying vacation homes. The companies offer them to employees for vacation use, while the individuals use them for vacations and rent them out through brokers at other times. The houses typically sell for $125,000 to $175,000.
"It's estimated that we've had 38 million visitors to Orlando this year," said Mr. Mandell.
Will any of these newer developments try to use the planning principles found at Celebration, endowed from the start with a commercial center of charm, in walking distance of housing? Peter S. Rummell, who was head of the development arm of the Disney Company when Celebration was built, is now chairman of the St. Joe Company, formerly the St. Joe Paper Company and now a development company that is Florida's largest private land owner. It is also the parent company of Arvida, which has developed about 60 planned communities in five states over the last 40 years, including Boca West, Long Boat Key and Sawgrass in Florida.
Two Arvida projects getting under way -- Victoria Park in Volusia County and WaterColor in Walton County, in the Florida Panhandle -- will make use of the central planning principle of Celebration, the placement of commercial space close to residences in the early stage of development, Mr. Rummell said.
"Pedestrian access is the heart of the neo-traditional movement in planning," he said. "Not everything can be within five minutes of downtown. There will be areas that will be remote. You can't just keep repeating because it's not economic. But we'll be mixing the two more than other developers have dared to do in the past."

HEADLINE: MUSIC;
Lessons From a Wagnerian Las Vegas

BYLINE: By MATTHEW GUREWITSCH; Matthew Gurewitsch writes about the arts for The Wall Street Journal and other publications.

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS

 BODY:
WHAT news on the Rialto?
Since spring, they've finished construction on the bridge and filled the Grand Canal; a few blocks down, a new Paris has its Opera, Eiffel Tower and Hotel de Ville; and "O" has spoiled me for "The Ring." 
 Greetings from Las Vegas, self-styled Entertainment Capital of the World, where I have lately landed to contemplate new frontiers for opera: opera, for the purposes of this discussion, standing for something greater than itself. Somewhat to the surprise of commentators unattuned to the cyclical rhythms of cultural history, an art form that not so long ago was being written off as a moribund anachronism is experiencing something like a renaissance.
Though critics complain of a repertory in stagnation, every season brings new titles anticipated with genuine excitement, and archaeological work in areas long abandoned (Handel, the French Baroque, early Mozart, bel canto) has expanded our sights quite a bit. At the same time, the ascendancy of the stage director, understood as the visionary in charge of the entire look, feel and meaning of a production, has transformed opera into the paradigm of theater itself. If opera has proved remarkably hospitable to dabblers from the worlds of spoken drama, dance and all manner of visual art, the reason is that everyone wants a piece of the operatic action. All theater, it now seems, aspires to the condition of opera.
"Prima la musica, poi le parole," or vice versa? What comes first? The words or the music? In the contemporary climate, the terms of that hoary debate seem oddly off the mark. On the list of what makes opera the glorious folly it is, spectacle now vies for supremacy with those two. Words are nothing in Las Vegas shows, and the music is at best atmosphere. But the point of this pilgrimage is spectacle, and spectacle is a commodity Las Vegas has always cultivated in spades.
Learning of my destination, some true believers in opera as our grandparents knew it were openly contemptuous. "Better you than me," sniffed one, summing up the general attitude and suppressing a yawn at the thought of the predictable fare awaiting him on his usual circuit of lyric temples. Well, he had made his bed. My own hope was to be jolted awake, my hunch being that opera could do worse than to steal a page or two from the new Vegas.
The new Vegas! In old-time show-biz algebra, of course, spectacle plus Las Vegas equaled girls, girls, girls: flamingos of the floor show asparkle in beads and sequins. Then came the boys from Germany, bearing big white cats and magic tricks. The latest extravaganzas are of a different order: pageants so rich and strange that they refresh our concept of what operatic stagecraft might be, potentially as influential as the ceremonies of Robert Wilson once upon a time (but a lot more fun).
The older shows are still eye-catching in their way, and an opera director might have occasion to lift a page from them now and then. In the interminable Captain Marvel fantasy that is Siegfried and Roy's long-running show at the Mirage, a golden army rattles in lock step, each knight hooked up to four empty suits of armor. Elsewhere, Siegfried meanders among flower-petal maidens like a senior Parsifal, encountering his Klingsor in the form of Roy, who levitates in a ring of fire. The fearless pair also encounters a dragon, Fafner to a heavy-metal T. The package has made a fortune. (The figure one hears is half a billion dollars.)
But the mind's eye of an opera fan adrift in Las Vegas can project opera just about anywhere, free of charge. The exterior of the new Venetian is ready-made for an alfresco "Gioconda" (all we need is the girl). In the maze of Caesar's Palace, a Peter Sellars "Clemenza di Tito" is waiting to happen. For "Idomeneo," cruise down to Mandalay Bay, with its man-made seashore and its six-foot breakers. Glazed eyes in stony faces keep from sight any demons clawing at the heart, yet the card tables at the casinos evoke "The Queen of Spades." The wheel of fortune whirls as in "The Gambler," though without the narcotic hum we hear in Prokofiev.
I came to Las Vegas for the waters. "O," Cirque du Soleil's site-specific aquatic spectacular, its title punning on the French for that most seductive element of the four, occupies a custom-built theater at Bel lagio: a theater unsurpassed in boldness by the Bayreuth Festspielhaus itself. Through the 90's, a string of touring shows established Cirque du Soleil as the brand name for a New Age art of the circus. That its aesthetic might also point new directions for opera might have seemed far-fetched. Now that a show and its showcase have been conceived in a single imaginative act, the kinship to the integrative ideal of opera is plain to see.
Misreading the literature, I understood "O" to take place entirely underwater, behind one wall of a tank specially microperforated so as not to fog up, with unseen respirators and frogmen in place to supply the performers with air.
The frogmen and respirators are there, beneath the surface of a pool 100 feet across. But that surface, rather than the usual stage floor, is what is seen from the house, and what is perforated is sectional platforms that rise and drop undetectably under the water. For dives from the 60-foot tower, the relevant sections sink to their maximum depth of 25 feet. At other times, the whole platform rises clear to stage level, and the cast seems to be skipping on water, until the floor dries and is, temporarily, just a floor.
At the start of the show, 16 pairs of feet sprout straight out of the pool and start dancing upside down. Later, a kaleidoscopic bevy of damsels clamber and balance into pyramid formation on a floating raft, observed by four beach boys who, between plunges, grace the pool's edge like so many Nijinsky fauns.
Water is the sovereign element here, no question, but the others count as well. At ground level, earth, an eerie procession files by, led by the sharp-beaked demon that the Klytemnestra of "Elektra" saw in the watches of the night. In the air, gymnastic phantoms man the ghost of a ship tossing through a tempest fit for "The Flying Dutchman." Most soul-shaking of all are the fires.
Picture this: Over here, a juggler bounds in, tumbling and flying around the ball of fire he swings on a chain. Over there, a hobo settles into his chair, reading his newspaper, unruffled as flame starts to lick at the toe of his shoe, unruffled as it spreads, enveloping the chair, his coat, his hat, his paper. At length he rises, unperturbed, and calmly makes to leave. Ah, but hasn't he forgotten something? Sure enough: the chair. Slowly he turns, collects his property and turns again to vanish, slowly, into the wings. What Tamino has ever done the like?
The curtain is up. In the theater's ample wings, trailing seaweed hair, masked nymphs limber up, as loose-limbed mermen hose off and serene riders mount their airborne steeds. Flashlight in hand, the technical director, Phil Jordan, ex of the Boston Ballet, is conducting a private backstage tour. From the catwalk, we have seen the curtain rip like the veil of the temple, then whisk out of sight. Below stage level, behind plate glass as in an aquarium, we have watched the clockwork choreography of the frogmen, all in black, always in the right place at the right time with air.
For the wet and scantily clad, the temperature is comfortable. A civilian in their midst is finding the air a shade tropical. But who cares? Before my eyes, in flesh and blood, are the Rhinemaidens, the Dutchman's phantoms, the Men in Armor for "The Magic Flute" of my dreams.
"I used to juggle on the street," explains Ray Wold, the blazing hobo, his fires now out. "People walked right by. I said to myself: 'I've got to make them stop. I'll set myself on fire.' " As modest and affable a fellow as you could hope to meet, Mr. Wold wears flame-resistant Kevlar from the crown of his bowler to the tips of his shoes, but nothing to shield his face. This act is his very own "Nessun dorma."
MYSTERE," Cirque du Soleil's first Las Vegas creation, is still running strong in a custom-built theater of its own at Treasure Island. In the fashion of so much contemporary theater, it is "nonlinear," but a series of images showing the transformation of grub to butterfly sustains a clear arc of continuity. Sometimes obviously, sometimes elliptically, the acts and imagery develop a pervasive theme of growth and transformation. A design motif of bulging oval bellies, like pregnancies affecting the male as well as the female may please viewers with a stronger taste than mine for the grotesque.
But there are sequences that would shine in any setting: the crystal-clear, stop-and-go group acrobatics on the ring of vertical, "Chinese" poles, or the thunderous ritual pounding of the Japanese drum, suspended in midair. Most wondrous of all -- and in a metaphoric sense, the most musical -- are Marco and Paulo Lo rador, brothers from Portugal. Their slow-motion hand-balancing routine (a dream of flight so intimate that it feels almost too private to watch), unfolds like the dialogue for violin and cello in the White Swan adagio of Tchaikovsky's "Swan Lake," which, as it happens, the composer recycled from the love duet of his abandoned opera "Undine."
Of perhaps more concrete interest to the visiting opera impresario, "Mystere" features bungee aerialists, whose volleys would adorn any number of operas of the exotic and supernatural, from Monteverdi, Cavalli, Lully, Rameau, Handel, Haydn and Gluck through Meyerbeer and Verdi to the fables of Rimsky-Korsakov, Prokofiev's "Love of Three Oranges" and Henze's neglected "Konig Hirsch."
In fact, the latest "Ring des Nibelungen" at the Lyric Opera of Chicago used lip-synching bungee Rhinemaidens, who got their moves from Debra Brown, Cirque du Soleil's resident choreographer. ("Die Walkure" had silent doubles, too: spear-brandishing Valkyries who bounded and somersaulted through the air from hidden trampolines.) Ms. Brown has also worked on the premiere productions of operas at the Metropolitan ("The Ghosts of Versailles") and the Canadian Opera Company ("The Golden Ass"), experiences she treasures. Still, she wonders how far the unfamiliar medium will allow her to go.
"I find myself in opera because of work I've done in circus," she says. "But coming from circus, where there's no fourth wall, I'd like to bring the action closer to the public, and I'm not sure that's appropriate.
"Opera is the most prestigious of the arts. Circus is born on the streets. That affects how they're delivered, the relationships inside the creation. There's a whole different rhythm at the heart of it all. Circus has no unions. People work for hours on end. Their skills are honed on the street. They develop an exceptional sense of timing. If they didn't grab your attention, they would die. Their art is what puts food on their table."
But the differences may not be so profound after all. Opera, however lofty it grows, has roots in popular entertainment, too, and a singer has to grab your attention no less than a juggler. Cirque du Soleil, as it has evolved, is no closer to the street (and no farther) than La Scala. The question is, can the Cirque aesthetic, fusing material of humble origin into a process akin to opera at its most lavish, ever contribute more to opera than fetching accents?
A simplistic answer is no. Cirque du Soleil's shows develop as self-standing artistic creations, generated through the synergy of its director, Franco Dragone, and his production team, on one hand, and the specific talents of the available performers, on the other. The usual business of an opera house, in contrast, is to stage the sort of pre-existing work we like, these days, to call a "text."
Now factor in the economics. The theater at Bellagio was built -- with a proscenium stage and theater-style seating in place of the cramped cocktail tables and banquettes of Vegas tradition -- at a cost of $70 million; producing "O" came to another $22 million: figures to strike terror in any impresario's heart. And running costs?
"Still to be determined," answers Pavel Brun, an alumnus of the Russian Theater Academy with credentials in pantomime, choreography, Soviet jazz-rock and the aerial high bar, and the artistic director of Cirque du Soleil's two Vegas shows. "There's no prior experience in theater history for a long-running aquatic show," Mr. Brun explains. "We can get comparison figures from related areas like bridge construction, cruise ships, military operations." He warns against focusing on the green stuff.
"We can do a black-and-white show with sawdust, and it might impress you just as much as this one," he declares. "I'm very far from believing that a humongous budget can surmount artistic problems. Our touring show 'Quidam' cost only $2 million Canadian, which would be about $1.5 million American. That's nothing, moneywise, but it had so many things to say."
For the moment, in any case, the bottom line for "O" remains elusive. Fortunately, Steve Wynn, the chairman of Mirage Resorts, has deep pockets. His was the entrepreneurial panache that initiated the Cirque du Soleil shows as exclusive and, he hopes, permanent Vegas fixtures. As for the income stream, tickets to "Mystere," in a 1,500-seat theater, go for $70 a pop; for "O," with 1,800 seats, the prices are $90 and $100. Each show does 476 performances a year, and most sell out. Thus, box-office receipts from "O" must total some $80 million a year, and Mr. Wynn's license to print money should be coming through any day now.
Again I ask, would a production anything like "O" be possible in an opera house? Maybe the answer will be less simplistic this time.
"You ask if it would be possible to apply Cirque's style, techniques and technology in the opera house," Mr. Brun shoots back. "Definitely. I can't wait to see it happen. Are there plans? I wish."
Mr. Brun reminds me that Cirque du Soleil is, after all, still in the business of putting on a circus. The elements it integrates are the ones that have been filling tents big and small for centuries. What is different is the framework -- and the purpose.
"Modern opera and the modern circus have the same problem," he says. "Ballet, too. Technique becomes the star of the show, the target of performance. That's wrong. Technique should be a language.
"We see wonderful singers, but their technique is overwhelming. We don't see a character, because the whole concentration is on the voice. It's the same with a trick at the circus. The ringmaster comes in and announces, 'Now we'll show you the quadruple somersault.' So what? For that I can go to the Olympics."
What is the most valuable lesson Cirque du Soleil might teach the opera crowd? "That production means much more than nice costumes, a nice set, a nice budget," Mr. Brun answers. "The job of the director is to develop a vocabulary that goes for everybody, from the diva down to the last chorus girl. It can't be done quickly. The job is to create superior individuals. If the 15th girl on the right is picking her nose, she's the one you see."
COULD the Cirque team make this happen in an opera house? Could an opera house do the job on its own?
"Without me, they can do nothing," Mr. Brun says, like other ex-Soviets keeping a straight face when striking the peremptory note.
But he exaggerates. Over the centuries, excellence in operatic production has broken forth from time to time. Even today, it is not unknown. Living witnesses can testify to the power -- total, on the right occasions -- of Wieland Wagner, Giorgio Strehler, Jean-Pierre Ponnelle, John Dexter (especially in collaboration with David Hockney), Gotz Friedrich, Harry Kupfer, Peter Sellars, Herbert Wernicke, Liliana Cavani, Luc Bondy, Nicholas Hytner, Dieter Dorn, Graham Vick.
Like Lord Elgin in Athens or Napoleon in Egypt, an opera producer on the loose in Nevada may catch the itch to plunder. Take all you can afford that will serve your purposes, say I. But most of all, look past the surface. Take fire, not window dressing. Let vision guide you. Shun hollow effect. Return to first principles. The gauntlet is down. Las Vegas has raised the bar.

Managing Risk at a Tainted Former Factory Site

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE

 BODY:
FOR more than four decades Rowe International churned out vending machines from its 328,697-square-foot complex on Troy Hills Road in Hanover Township. When it closed in 1995 there were competing visions for the future of the 34-acre environmentally tainted site.
The Morris County township wanted to see it recycled for housing. So three years ago Hanover rezoned the land for 49 single-family detached homes compatible with those that had sprung up over the years around the old plant. Since the site was to be redeveloped for housing, state environmental laws would require that it be cleaned to the highest standard. 
 But the owner wanted to sell the property for an industrial re-use, which would require a less stringent cleanup. And Rowe International, which had started that cleanup, sued the township over the rezoning.
The result, after two years of negotiations, is unusual. LandBank, an environmental remediation and development firm based in Lakewood, Colo., acquired the site from Rowe last September for an undisclosed price, with the condition that Rowe drop its lawsuit. LandBank also assumed the risks of completing the cleanup of the property according to state standards for residential re-use.
At the same time, LandBank has a deal in place with Sterling Properties of Livingston, under which the housing developer will buy the site for an agreed upon price once the cleanup, which LandBank expects to take two years, has been completed.
Joseph Forgione, a Sterling principal, said most of the homes in the $50 million subdivision would be on quarter-acre lots, adding that they would be 2,400 to 2,800 square feet in size and cost an average of $400,000, the county average for new homes.
The resolution of the conflicting visions not only addresses the cost of the cleanup, but also offers protection from lawsuits if unknown contaminants are found -- issues that historically have daunted buyers and sellers of polluted sites. LandBank has obtained $16.65 million in insurance policies from United National Insurance Company, of Balla Cynwyd, Pa., to cover cost overruns and protect, in perpetuity, Rowe and Sterling Properties -- as well as Whippany Ventures I, the entity LandBank created to acquire the site. Future liability for the site and surrounding properties is limited to known contaminants associated with the plant.
LandBank's parent -- the IT Group, a publicly traded environmental engineering and services firm in Monroeville, Pa. -- has also supplied a guaranty to the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, which oversees such cleanups, that the former Rowe site will be cleaned to state standards.
All parties involved are pleased with the resolution of the problem, calling it an example of recycling so-called brownfields as available sites for development dwindle.
"We're seeing more adaptive re-uses as a result of the state's change from a manufacturing to a service economy and of a strong residential market," said David J. Schoner, a vice president at Coldwell Banker, the residential real estate firm based in Parsippany.
He added that the activity was not surprising in eastern Morris County, where available land is scarce, because its access to job centers and major roadways continues to draw home buyers and, in turn, developers.
Mr. Forgione said that was among the reasons his company got involved with the Rowe property, which he said was among the last sizable tracts left open to development in the 10-square-mile township. "To develop such sites requires creative solutions," he said.
Efforts by the state and municipalities like Hanover are also helping to return polluted sites to productive re-use. In Hanover, "the secret is to make the economics work" on such sites as Rowe's, which are remnants of the community's past as a factory and mill town, said Sal Iannaccone, a township committeeman and Hanover's director of planning. With the Rowe site, he said, "we rezoned it to a density that provided enough building lots" so recycling could make economic sense.
Mr. Iannaccone said the township had used, or will use, the same formula for other brownfields in its borders, including a 77-acre site on Eden Lane that once housed the Whippany Paper Board factory, which has been rezoned for office use. The current owner is advancing plans to turn it into a three-building, 750,000-square-foot office complex.
EFFORTS to recycle former industrial sites got a helping hand nearly two years ago when the state enacted the Brownfields and Contaminated Site Redemption Act. The measure provides for reimbursing developers up to 75 percent of the cost of the completed cleanup -- if, among other things, the redevelopment would generate tax revenue exceeding the cost of the cleanup. It also protects purchasers from private lawsuits related to past contamination problems and carries an assurance that the state will not sue once the site is cleaned according to its standards.
The state's efforts have helped facilitate the re-use of the 10,000 contaminated sites in New Jersey, down from about 20,000 in 1985, according to the Site Remediation Program, which is under the jurisdiction of the state's Department of Environmental Protection. Of the remaining sites, 1,130 are brownfields, which the state defines as tainted industrial or commercial sites.
In the case of the Hanover deal, Alphonse J. Inserra, a case manager at the Site Remediation Program, said that "a large company that has the financing is taking on the cleanup project and will be able to do it quickly and make a profit."
Kyle R. Cascioli, director of real estate acquisitions at LandBank, said his company would clean the Rowe site to state standards without state subsidies, adding that his concern was involved with over a dozen such deals across the country.
For such deals to work, he said, they must include a site with intrinsic real estate value, a firm to competitively clean it and an insurance policy to make the seller and buyer of the land and its developer "comfortable that the risks have been removed." All those factors are in place in the Hanover deal, he said.
Mr. Cascioli said his company estimated the total cost of the Hanover project at $4.3 million to $4.5 million, including the cost to acquire, insure and clean the site, with the cleanup alone costing $1.65 million.
In addition to protecting the parties from environmental liabilities, one of the three insurance policies LandBank obtained will cover an additional $1.65 million in unexpected costs that could arise if unknown pollutants are found.
The company will recapture the overall cost of the project when it sells the cleaned property to Sterling. Mr. Forgione, the Sterling principal, would only say that his company has contracted to buy the site for more than $4 million, noting that the assurance against liability was key to the transaction.
Richard J. Conway Jr., a Morristown-based environmental lawyer who represents Rowe International, agreed.
"It's fair to say Rowe is pleased with the transaction," he said. "LandBank has a contract to clean the site and Rowe will no longer have to worry about the New Jersey facility."
Once LandBank's parent guaranteed the cleanup, the state returned the $2 million bond Rowe posted for the remediation, which Rowe and LandBank will share. Though Mr. Cascioli would not disclose how the money is to be divided, he said Rowe, which has moved to Grand Rapids, Mich., would be compensated for the land and LandBank would be able to make a profit for taking on the cleanup risk.
LandBank began the cleanup immediately after it took title to the site in September. The work involves removing asbestos from the old plant and then demolishing it and cleaning the contaminants on the site and in the groundwater, including metals such as chrome and chlorinated solvents left behind by the manufacturing operations.
Mr. Forgione said Sterling had secured county approval for the housing project, adding that it would seek approval from the Hanover Township Planning Board this month. He said he expected to start construction on the project, called Forest Hill Estates, late next summer.
As planned, the brick and stucco homes, designed by Thomas Brennan, an architect based in Plano, Tex., will have three or four bedrooms and such features as two-car garages and full basements. He said they would be built on 28 of the 34 acres of the site; the rest will be left as open space.

HEADLINE: Groups Challenge New H.I.V. Testing Law

BYLINE: By MELINDA TUHUS

 BODY:
A LAW that took effect in Connecticut on Oct. 1 requiring that newborns be tested for H.I.V. if their mothers refuse to be tested during pregnancy or delivery is being challenged by health providers, women's groups and civil libertarians.
Opponents charged that the law is an invasion of privacy and will cause women to flee prenatal care. Supporters said it will help identify babies, and mothers, who test positive for H.I.V., enabling both to receive care. 
 The Connecticut law requires that pregnant women be counseled about the value of testing and the opportunities for treatment, but says they can still decline testing. If they do, according to the law, the babies must then be tested, as they are now tested at birth for eight other diseases.
Connecticut was the second state to pass such as law. New York passed it with similar controversy in 1996.
"Everyone agrees that testing the pregnant woman is much better than testing the baby," said Nettie Mayersohn, a an assemblywoman from New York City who was the moving force behind the New York law. "But some women don't access prenatal care, and some mothers are in denial and don't want to be tested. We have to make sure babies are identified and get into treatment."
All babies born to H.I.V.-positive mothers will test H.I.V.-positive at birth, so testing the baby is a way of testing the mother. Public health studies show that with no treatment, 25 percent of these babies will remain H.I.V.-positive, while the rest will convert to negative in about a year, when the baby develops its own immune systems and clears its mother's antibodies.
The federal Centers for Disease Control has recommended universal testing of pregnant women, but not mandatory testing.
The new law has been challenged by the Connecticut Hospital Association, which filed a lawsuit in October to overturn it. The group represents all 31 acute care hospitals in the state. The association is challenging the constitutionality of the statute based on a woman's right to privacy. The lawsuit is expected to go to trial next year in federal district court in New Haven.
Jennifer Jackson, a lawyer representing the association in the lawsuit, said, "We fully support efforts to increase H.I.V. testing in pregnant women, but we're very concerned that this law creates an atmosphere of mandated testing that may interfere with the patient-provider relationship and will discourage women from seeking health care. The law is contrary to long-standing hospital and physician policies and practices."
The Connecticut Civil Liberties Union, representing women's, public health and AIDS groups, as well as some individual doctors, said it expects to file a friend of the court brief in the spring.
"When we fought this bill in the state legislature," said Joseph Grabarz, the executive director of the state Civil Liberties Union, "we brought 36 public health experts who testified that this law would be counter-productive in fighting pediatric AIDS."
Mr. Grabarz, as well as several other opponents, focus on the "fleeing care" effect they believe the law will have on women who are at high risk, or perceived to be at high risk, for contracting H.I.V., "particularly if there is a language difference or a socio-economic difference," he said, between the care giver and the pregnant woman.
But Sen. Toni Harp, Democrat of New Haven and chief sponsor of the law, said most women in high-risk groups, such as prostitutes and intravenous-drug users, are already being offered H.I.V. testing. "The women we worry about most are those who are married to I.V.-drug users or to men with multiple sex partners," she said, who may not be aware of their partners' activities that put them at risk. Many of these women's doctors are in private practice.
"This is a way to get people to understand that H.I.V. is not a disease of specific groups, but that it can affect people across the spectrum," Senator Harp said.
She also noted that the issue is very politically charged. "Some people in the AIDS advocacy community oppose the law publicly, but have told me privately that they think it's the right thing to do," she said.
Senator Harp said State Department of Public Health statistics show that 95 percent of women take the test when it's offered, but that too often care givers decide their patients are not at risk for AIDS and so don't offer testing.
A study conducted in New York state between August 1995 and January 1997 of almost a thousand H.I.V.-exposed babies was published last year by the New England Journal of Medicine. It showed that the transmission rate for babies born to women treated with the anti-viral drug AZT during pregnancy was 6.1 percent; when the mother was treated during delivery, the transmission rate was 10 percent; when treatment of the baby began during the first 48 hours of life, the rate was 9.3 percent; and when begun at three days or older, the rate was 18.4 percent.
"There's absolutely no evidence that women are fleeing treatment" because of the law, said Ms. Mayersohn, the New York assemblywoman. "Opponents said women would give birth in the streets of New York because they'd be afraid of getting tested if they went to a hospital."
But the law has actually had the reverse effect, she said.
"Women know their babies are going to be tested, so more mothers are agreeing to be tested prenatally," she said.
Opponents said the mandatory approach is an attack on pregnant women's autonomy.
"The law reduces the power of mothers to decide," said Michael Merson, dean of the Yale School of Epidemiology and Public Health and former head of the United Nations Global Program on AIDS.
Dr. Merson said that before the law passed, only a handful of H.I.V.-positive babies had been identified in Connecticut in the past few years, largely because so many H.I.V.-positive pregnant women are treated with AZT.
"Are there more babies we don't know about? That's the issue," he said. "We did not have evidence that there were a lot of H.I.V.-infected babies. Why don't we create regulations for getting the health care system to work better to test women? That shows respect for women and allows them to control their lives."
Under the Connecticut law, babies whose mothers were not tested are screened at birth for H.I.V. The results are available within 48 hours, but the screen can produce false positives. The results of a confirmatory test are not available for at least a week more.
That can lead to agonizing choices for women whose babies test positive. Mothers of these babies are told not to breast feed, because breast milk also contains the virus and can be passed to the baby. If a confirmatory test is negative, by then it's too late to start breast feeding.
Several opponents of the law also said they were concerned about giving AZT to newborns who may turn out to be H.I.V.-negative, because the medication, while effective in preventing AIDS, could harm the baby. However, there is no evidence that AZT has harmed babies who have been treated, although some doctors are concerned about possible long-term effects.
One pregnant woman who recently was offered the test, and took it, said she thought the law was a good idea. Maribel Friend of Madison has a 17-month old daughter, but she said she was not offered the test by her doctor during her first pregnancy.
She preferred taking the test as soon as possible rather than waiting until her baby was born. "With an illness like this," she said, "the earlier you find out, the better the baby's chances.
"If it had come back positive I would have said, 'Why me?' " she said. "But it could happen to anyone. You could have a partner who is cheating on you. I think people are scared to find out if anything is wrong with them, so making it mandatory is good. You want to do the best thing for your child."

HEADLINE: In the Region/Long Island;
Median House Prices Soar to Record Levels

BYLINE: By DIANA SHAMAN

 BODY:
WHEN Gary and Diana Fernbach started looking for a house, they first searched in Port Washington, attracted by its good school district and proximity to family. Since the mid-80's, they had been living in a co-op in the same community.
But they had no luck. "The worst house in town," said Mr. Fernbach, "was priced at $300,000." 
 So Mr. Fernbach, a computer administrator for a food service company in Melville, and his wife, a teacher-supervisor in a Glen Cove nursery school, did some research. They discovered that Plainview, a 20-minute drive from Port Washington, had equally good schools but far more reasonable house prices.
The four-bedroom Cape Cod into which they moved in September cost them $252,000. A four-bedroom house in Port Washington would have cost at least $100,000 more, Mr. Fernbach said.
"It was frustrating that we couldn't stay in the town we wanted, so we made a compromise," he said. "But it worked out for us because now we are very happy."
Making compromises has become a solution for many buyers in Long Island's strong housing market, where prices recently reached their highest dollar levels ever.
Sales figures obtained by the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island from its roughly 1,000 member offices show that for the month of October the median closing price of a house in Nassau County was $230,000, a $30,000 increase over October 1998. In Suffolk County, the median closing price in October was $165,000 compared with $150,000 12 months earlier.
And those figures don't tell the entire story. Because of the strong market, brokers say, increasing numbers of sellers ask brokers not to put their houses on multiple listing to avoid unnecessary heavy traffic. Sales of those exclusive listings are not always reported to the Multiple Listing Service.
Also not reported by the M.L.S. are sales by owners, co-op sales and sales by brokers who are not part of the M.L.S. system. But, said Sal L. Prividera Jr., spokesman for the New York State Association of Realtors, "We feel our realtors cover 80 to 85 percent of the market."
Carolyn Weber, vice president of ReMax of New York, which has 15 offices in Nassau and Suffolk, said sales by her agents show an overall 18.8 percent increase in prices over the 12-month period ended last October. "It boggles my mind what people are paying for properties," she said, "but we have a very affluent society around here."
"Buyer confidence" is driving the housing market, said Joseph E. Mottola, chief executive of the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island and the Long Island Board of Realtors. "The unemployment rate here is very low, the cost of our energy is less than it used to be, and you still have favorable interest rates," he said.
People who need a house may be shocked by what sellers are asking, said Teresa Angelino, a broker with ReMax's Roslyn office. "They start out with a limit in mind, but when they realize that prices may continue to go up they go the extra mile," she said.
Also driving prices up is lack of inventory. "We're in a very unique market because there is practically no product," said Jane Salamon, a partner in the Sterling Properties brokerage in Roslyn. "If a house comes on the market that is priced even within the top side of reason, it sells right away."
Even the recent rise in the national average interest for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages -- from 7.32 to 7.67 percent in six months ended Dec. 6 -- has had very little effect on the market, brokers say. Many people are taking profits out of the stock market and investing them in real estate, said Pat Masone, manager of the Prudential Long Island Realty office in Huntington. "We have people buying $2 million homes for all cash," she said.
In Jericho, which has two highly rated school districts, prices in better neighborhoods have gone up "dramatically," said Linda Petralia, manager of ERA Gatewood in Syosset. For example, she said, a four-bedroom split-level sold in July 1998 for $350,000. Last March, she continued, a similar house next door sold for $450,000.
But first-time buyers like Madelyn and John McGrane, who recently signed a contract to purchase a $238,000 three-bedroom ranch in East Northport through ReMax's Huntington office, say that waiting for the market to soften and for prices to ease also has its frustrations.
"The problem with waiting is that you wind up paying out rent when you could be owning something," said Mrs. McGrane. "I also think that houses in our price range will continue to go up because there is a housing shortage. Very little is being built for under $500,000 and how many people can afford that."
LIKE many buyers in today's market, the McGranes, who had been house hunting for six months, made an immediate offer when they saw the house they liked.
"We decided to buy in a matter of minutes," Mrs. McGrane said, "because our experience had been that houses were on the market a day or two and then they were gone."
Kathy Betz-Behette and Joe Behette also made an offer on their house as soon as they saw it. "At one point, I threw my hands up," said Mrs. Betz-Behette, describing her experiences as a home buyer. "For every house there seemed to be 50 buyers."
After searching for 18 months, she said, they found just what they wanted, a three-bedroom colonial in Williston Park.
"We liked it, the price was right, and we were not going to walk out of this home without purchasing it," Mrs. Betz-Behette said, explaining why she and her husband immediately offered the owners their $265,000 asking price.
After they made their offer, other people offered the owners $20,000 more, but fortunately for them the sellers stuck to the deal, she said.
"It used to be people would look at a house and say, 'I'll go home and think about it,' " said Toby Klingsberg, an associate broker with the Jan Kalman agency in Woodmere. "Now, if they come across something that meets their needs they jump on it."
And that leaves some sellers on the other side of the fence, faced with finding a house in a seller's market.
John Ficara and his wife, Robin, placed their four-bedroom split level in Jericho on the market at the end of August because they wanted a bigger house on a quieter street. They found a buyer two weeks later.
"I heard the market was good, but I didn't expect it to be that good," Mr. Ficara said. He declined to specify the selling price other than to say it was in the high $300,000 range. The closing will take place in January.
Fortunately, he added, he and his wife own a rental house, which they will now use temporarily until they find another.
"We've already started looking and prices are really high, " said Mr. Ficara, who is a certified public accountant. "We are hoping that the market will slow down so that we can buy on a dip."
After selling their home in Syosset two weeks after placing it on the market, Steven Sklover, a dress manufacturer, and his wife, Joan, a secretary for a cable news station, found themselves in a bidding war for a house they wanted to purchase in Williston Park. The found a four-bedroom colonial.
The seller wanted $300,000, and they made a $275,000 offer, Mr. Sklover said. But with other buyers also interested and bidding against them, they wound up paying $296,000.
Although many houses sell quickly, "buyers are very shrewd and compare properties, so if a house is overpriced, it will sit there and not sell," said Camille Pisciotto, owner of Great Neck Realty Better Homes and Gardens in Great Neck.
But the concept of what is overpriced is open to question as the market catches up with what might have been an inflated price a year ago.
For example, a four-bedroom house in Great Neck that might have sold for $350,000 a year ago now is priced at $435,000, according to Ms. Pisciotto.
The same holds true for co-op apartments in Great Neck, said Liza DiMarco, who handles co-op sales for Ms. Pisciotto. One-bedroom apartments now typically fetch $90,000 compared with $70,000 at the beginning of 1999, she said, and two-bedroom units, which are the most in demand, have risen to $325,000 from $225,000 over the same time period.
Ray Manzoni, who owns an agency that bears his name in Mount Sinai, said that prices in his area of Suffolk have increased 15 percent to 20 percent over the last year. He said he advises sellers who are in no rush to sell to price their houses at slightly more than market value and then be prepared to come down on the price. "If you can sell your house in a day, it means you're selling it too cheaply," he said.
While those selling tactics could put even greater pressure on prices, some observers predict that a leveling will occur next year as the amount of inventory increases. "I think the market will continue to do well in the year 2000," said Mr. Mottola of the Multiple Listing Service. "But as prices go up and as interest rates rise, the balance between supply and demand will begin to moderate."
Some brokers are already seeing faint signs of change. Evelyn Atanas, owner of a Williston Park real estate agency that bears her name, said she had already noticed a slight drop in the number of callers. "There are still people looking, but somehow I don't feel that excitement that was there a few months ago," she said. "Prices have escalated to such a point that a lot of people are beginning to say, 'Let me wait.' "

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: Rockefeller University's Campus Bridge Over East 63rd Street;
An Engineering and Legal Feat

BYLINE: By David W. Dunlap

 BODY:
Don't let its lyre-like simplicity mislead you.
New York's newest bridge, linking the north and south ends of the Rockefeller University campus across the barrier of East 63rd Street, is a complex feat of engineering -- both structurally and legally. 
 Its signature feature is an 87-foot-high, white, V-shaped steel tower on the north side of the street, between York Avenue and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive. Cradled within the crook of the V is a cantilevered pedestrian deck and utility conduit, stayed by five pairs of diagonal steel cables. The cables are tied down on the north end of the bridge and threaded through the tower, extending as far as 94 feet, almost all the way across 63rd Street.
And it is the cables that one notices on approaching the bridge from the west. "The first premise was that the bridge had to be light," said Wendy Evans Joseph, the architect who designed the structure, in collaboration with Matthys P. Levy of Weidlinger Associates, an engineering concern.
The asymmetry of the bridge reduces its profile in the streetscape. "As you come upon it," Ms. Joseph said, "you see the cables -- not the tower."
The $2 million bridge will not open until early next year. But its origins can be traced to a 1973 agreement under which Rockefeller University, a biomedical research center, along with the New York Hospital and the Hospital for Special Surgery were permitted to build over the F.D.R. Drive. Rockefeller was also given the right to build over 63rd Street, through air space that was officially demapped and conveyed to the university, said its lawyer, Robert S. Cook Jr. of De Forest & Duer.
That was not the only air space involved. The new bridge also crosses an easement that the university granted to the city for an earlier pedestrian bridge along 63rd Street -- perpendicular to the new span -- that the public uses to get to the East River esplanade. "So the university had to take back a piece" of that easement, Mr. Cook said.
The new bridge will serve researchers and faculty members living in Scholars Residence and Faculty House, many of whose children attend the university's preschool center on the main campus. The towers are separated from the campus by 63rd Street, a particularly daunting crossing because it also serves as a ramp to and from the F.D.R. Drive.
The Scholars Residence was designed with a wall that could be knocked out to accommodate a bridge. But there seemed to be no economical way of supporting a span on the south end. So the bridge project was stymied until 1996, when the subject came up in a dinner conversation between Ms. Joseph and Torsten N. Wiesel, who was then president of the university. The architect asked if she might try to find a solution. Rather than designing a bridge supported at both ends, she proposed a span that would be cantilevered over the street.
Adding further complexity to the geometry of the bridge, the utility conduit branches off at the north end from the pedestrian deck, which runs into the Benjamin and Irma G. Weiss Research Building, straight through the cafeteria and past the elevator bank, ending at a curved staircase in the lobby.
The plaza in front of Weiss is also being rebuilt, to designs by Thomas Balsley Associates, working with Ms. Joseph, to create a greater sense of openness and transition to the south end of campus.
"The apartment buildings felt quite isolated," said George B. Candler, the director of planning and construction at Rockefeller University. "This, for the first time, links 400 families and gives them the sense of being part of the community." DAVID W. DUNLAP

HEADLINE: GOVERNMENT;
Legislators Approve Measure To Cover Infertility Treatment

BYLINE: By WENDY GINSBERG

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
State senators met for a voting session on Monday and the Assembly held a voting session on Thursday. Here are some highlights.
 
INFERTILITY -- Health insurers would be required to provide coverage for the treatment of infertility under a bill passed in the Senate. 
 The bill would require health care providers who insure more than 50 people to pay for services that would detect infertility and also help pay for procedures such as in vitro fertilization. A woman under 35 who has been unsuccessfully trying to become pregnant for two years would be eligible for the treatment. A woman age 35 or older would have to try to become pregnant for one year before she could receive treatment. Other medical conditions that cause infertility would also be covered under the bill.
Senator Robert J. Martin, a Republican from Morris Plains who is the bill's sponsor, said other states including Massachusetts and Minnesota had passed similar measures dealing with infertility, which he said inflicted "extraordinary physical and mental strain."
But Fred Hillmann, a spokesman for Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield, said the cost of health insurance could rise up to 3 percent if the bill is passed, an increase that he said would make insurance unaffordable for an estimated 30,000 people.
The bill now goes to the Assembly.
 
TROOPERS' LEGAL BILLS -- State troopers who are cleared of wrongdoing in a criminal lawsuit resulting from actions while at work would receive back pay and have their legal fees reimbursed under a bill passed in the Senate.
The bill would be retroactive and could cover the legal fees for the troopers John Hogan and James Kenna if they are acquitted of attempted murder and aggravated assault charges connected with an April 1998 shooting on the New Jersey Turnpike.
The bill would give troopers the same legal protections granted to other police officers in the state, said Assemblyman Neil M. Cohen, a Democrat from Elizabeth, who sponsored the bill. Currently, troopers are given representation in civil cases, but have to pay for their own defense against criminal charges.
Supporters of the bill cite the cases of two troopers who were denied back pay for time when they were suspended from duty -- in one case for more than a year -- though they were acquitted of charges. The bill now awaits approval from the governor.
 
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE -- Victims of domestic violence who are fired because they miss too many work days as a result of court proceedings would be eligible for unemployment benefits under a bill passed in the Senate.
Under the bill, people who can prove they were battered or abused would also receive worker's compensation for days they missed because they feared their abuser would find them at their workplace.
Sandy J. Clark, associate director of the Coalition for Battered Women, said the bill was necessary because a victim can become a "sitting duck" for a batterer who knows where and when the victim will be at work. She said the bill would give domestic violence victims the economic independence needed to escape their abuser.
Victims who are eligible for benefits would be subject to the same restrictions as other unemployment recipients.
The bill now goes to the Assembly.
 
PARKING TICKETS -- Motorists would be excused from paying fines for parking tickets that are more than three years old under a bill passed in the Senate.
The bill, which now heads to the Assembly, requires that a motorist be cleared of charges if the town's court system fails to provide notice of the violation by issuing a warrant for arrest or ordering suspension of a driver's license.
The bill's sponsor, Assemblyman Alan M. Augustine, a Republican from New Providence, said three years was ample time for a municipality to inform a driver of a violation.

SAFE NEEDLES -- Hospitals and other health care centers would be required to use safer needles under a bill passed by the Assembly.
The bill was prompted by estimates from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that more than 1 million accidental needle sticks occur in the country each year. Bernard W. Gerard, Jr., vice president of Health Professionals and Allied Employees, estimates that 18,000 to 30,000 needlestick injuries occur each year in New Jersey. The accidental stickings can lead to hepatitis B infections or HIV.
Rick Abrams, the president of the New Jersey Association of Health Care Facilities, said he did not oppose the bill, but has some fears about the cost of implementing it.
The bill now heads to the Senate for a vote.

HEADLINE: ON POLITICS;
What If Officials Got a Raise And Nobody Complained?

BYLINE: By David Halbfinger; David Halbfinger reports from Trenton for The New York Times.

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
Lawmakers here are about to give themselves a 40 percent raise, and hardly anybody seems to care.
To a new arrival from across the Hudson, it was unthinkable at first. From afar, or from the car while driving through, New Jerseyans seemed much more knowledgeable about state politics than New Yorkers, and always livid about something -- screaming over the radio or forming human chains, jealously guarding their wallets and threatening to throw the bums out at the slightest sign of government waste. 
 Not now.
Even members of the Legislature seem a little surprised at the silence. A year ago, fearing a scathing reaction from the public, they appointed a commission to give the idea of a pay increase close scrutiny, and to give themselves a shred of political cover. Conveniently, it took until after the Assembly election in November for the seven-member panel to meet for the first time, though it took just eight and a half hours spread over five days to do its entire job, recommending a jump in pay from $35,000 to $49,000 for lawmakers, the first increase since 1990.
But when the commission finally held its one and only public hearing on Dec. 1, just three people showed up to argue against a raise for lawmakers and for the governor, judges and other officials whose salaries were examined. The state's leading taxpayer groups all stayed away.
James DiEleuterio, the president of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, who headed the commission, said the paucity of opposition was telling. "Don't you think that would indicate that everyone accepts the idea that people need to be paid a reasonable salary?" he said.
Certainly, a decade is a long time for anyone to go without a raise. And the proposed increases would not take effect, at the earliest, until 2002, after the next legislative election.
It is a bit of a stretch, though, to mistake the vacuum for a broad public consensus. John F. Sheridan, director of New Jersey Citizens for Tax Reform, said his group remained "adamantly opposed" to a pay raise, but didn't see the sense in saying so formally. "Why waste our time?" he said. "It's a done deal."
Yet Mr. Sheridan, who vowed to fight the re-election of anyone who votes to fatten his or her own paycheck, admitted in the next breath that his threats might not be all that meaningful.
"It depends on our fund-raising," he said. "The economy's killing everybody. When people are fat and happy, it's hard to get money. When they're scared because government's reaching into their wallet for what little they have, it's pretty easy."
Still, one has to wonder whether the commission's recommendations would have come out the same -- the lone taxpayer advocate on the panel, Sam Perelli, was essentially ignored -- had Mr. Sheridan or someone from a similar group chosen to make even a symbolic stand.
The minutes of the Dec. 3 session, for example, reflect a short discussion of legislators' pay. "The New Jersey legislature works harder than other state legislatures," the stenographer typed. "Positions are really full-time."
Mr. DiEleuterio noted that a Rutgers professor found that the average New Jersey lawmaker puts in a 35-hour week. "That's certainly starting to push the limit in terms of what should be considered a part-time job," he said.
For many lawmakers, it is a full-time job. But not for all. And neither the Rutgers professor, Alan Rosenthal, nor the commission itself paid any attention at all to how much some legislators earn in the other full-time jobs they manage to hold down at the same time.
Around 10 percent of the 120 members of the Legislature are employed in other government jobs, whether at the county or local level or in schools. And then there are the dual officeholders, among them the Assembly's minority leader, Joseph V. Doria, who is also mayor of Bayonne; Assemblyman Raul Garcia, the mayor of Union City; and Senator Nicholas J. Sacco, the mayor of North Bergen, who also is principal of a public elementary school in his hometown.
Then there is Sharpe James, of Newark, who now earns more than the president of the United States. As mayor of New Jersey's largest city, he is paid $168,000. With his pay as a state senator from the 29th district, his gross yearly earnings hit $203,000. Mr. James, of course, proposed a ban on dual officeholding as soon as he won a special election to his Senate seat. There haven't been any takers so far.
For now, the commission's recommendations seem likely to pass in a hurry, although Governor Whitman has expressed some reservations about raising the pay of members of the Casino Control Commission more than 50 percent, from $90,000 to $141,000.
"People are fat and happy," said Mr. Sheridan of Citizens for Tax Reform. "They're thinking about Y2K, and the Christmas holidays. Nobody's paying attention. When the bills come due, and they will, there's going to be a mighty angry electorate out there."

A Spoonful of Sugar For Microsoft's Bitter Pill

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
A Spoonful of Sugar
For Microsoft's Bitter Pill
HERE was a second round of secrecy-cloaked settlement talks between Microsoft and the Government last week in Chicago. The only sure thing about these meetings, presided over by Richard A. Posner, a Federal appeals court judge, is that they are hardly social gatherings; there is no love lost, and a common ground for compromise will not be easy to find.
Microsoft will not voluntarily agree to the harsher sanctions being considered by the Justice Department and 19 states -- a breakup of the company or forced licensing of the programming code for Windows -- unless Judge Posner proves to be a sorcerer instead of a mediator. And the government will not accept a sin-no-more solution in which Microsoft signs a settlement that prohibits certain kinds of conduct or contracts. 
 Is there any sensible middle ground? That remains to be seen.
Hal R. Varian, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley, has an intriguing proposal. Mr. Varian is a leading "new economy" academic who studies the workings of high-technology markets. He was co-author of a widely praised 1998 book, "Information Rules," with his Berkeley colleague Carl Shapiro, who was the Justice Department's chief antitrust economist in 1995 and 1996 and is now advising the states on remedies in the Microsoft case.
In a settlement or in court-ordered remedies, Mr. Varian says, it is a foregone conclusion that Microsoft will be swallowing some strong medicine, considering Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's blunt findings last month that the company was a monopolist whose tactics had thwarted competition and hurt consumers.
Mr. Varian says two measures will be "an absolute minimum." The first is to make Microsoft publish prices it charges personal-computer makers for its Windows operating system and to open up its marketing contracts with PC makers, Internet service providers and others. Mr. Varian says such pricing and contract "transparency," monitored by a third-party watchdog, would inhibit Microsoft from using price and other incentives to reward companies that gave its products favored treatment and punish those that did not -- a key allegation in the antitrust suit.
THE second minimal step, according to Mr. Varian, would be to require Microsoft to publish Windows application program interfaces and explain how they work. These interfaces, known as A.P.I.'s, are the software hooks that enable other companies' programs, from word processors to games, to run properly on Windows computers. Some software developers contend that Microsoft has "hidden A.P.I.'s" in Windows that give a leg up to its own applications business and favored partners. Microsoft dismisses that assertion as the equivalent of an urban legend. Other developers say the real problem is that the A.P.I. documentation from Microsoft is often misleading or erroneous.
Both steps would help achieve the government's main policy goal in the antitrust case: to limit Microsoft's ability in new markets to use Windows monopoly power to its advantage, from server software to e-commerce. "But the real issue is what you do beyond documented A.P.I.'s and transparent contracts," Mr. Varian said.
His next step is his innovative contribution to the Microsoft debate. Mr. Varian recommends compulsory licensing of Windows at a deep discount after a set period. Say the license price for Windows 98 is $55 a copy. After two or three years, the price would drop by perhaps $30. The timing and discount could be negotiated in a settlement or determined by a court.
Throughout the case, Microsoft has said that it is simply fighting for the right to innovate and add whatever it wants to its operating system. "This plan would really give them an incentive to innovate, because in two or three years the existing version of Windows is going to get a lot cheaper," Mr. Varian explained.
Today, new versions of Windows face competition of sorts from the old versions, but Microsoft makes sure that PC makers have every incentive to upgrade at the pace that suits Microsoft. Under the Varian option, however, manufacturers like Dell Computer, Gateway and Compaq could offer both and permit consumers to choose the older, cheaper version if they preferred.
The economic incentives for Microsoft might also change, so that bundling ever more features into a bloated operating system stops making sense. Instead, it might see greater overall profits in making Windows a leaner, faster, more reliable core operating system and in marketing new features like voice-recognition software as a separate product.
The Varian solution is not simple, since it requires a form of policing and regulation. But there are only complex answers to the Microsoft problem. Mr. Varian's mirrors the logic of patents and copyrights: the inventor is rewarded with exclusive rights for a while, but the duration is limited to avoid the social losses from monopolization.
"With this, the software passes into the compulsory licensing phase, not into the public domain," Mr. Varian said. "But the result is the same. You would get a temporary monopoly in the intellectual property that provides a balancing of private incentives and the public good."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: LOWER EAST SIDE;
Business District Hangs Its Hopes on a New Manager

BYLINE: By ERIC V. COPAGE 

 BODY:
A decade ago, much of the Lower East Side was dilapidated and dangerous. Storefronts were boarded up and drugs were rampant. But in the last few years, the neighborhood has turned its gritty reality into a virtue, attracting the young and chic to its bars, restaurants, stores and avant-garde theaters.
Matthew Bauer, the former executive director of the Lower East Side Business Improvement District, is often credited as the engine behind the best of those changes. 
 "I think Matthew was the first person to really organize a very disparate group of merchants," said Susan Vaughn, the chairwoman of Community Board 3. "He brought a lot of positive publicity for the area."
But Mr. Bauer left three months ago to become president of the Madison Avenue Business Improvement District. The Lower East Side district has hired Andrew Flamm, 31, a former marketing manager with the city's Economic Development Corporation, to fill his shoes.
"Andrew's background was eclectic," said Howard Slonim, the business district president. "He had an economic background and a business development background, and also experience in relating to merchants. He was a natural fit for the position."
Mr. Flamm, who started work last month, said he had been getting to know the merchants. He said they told him that they wanted continued foot traffic and a more physically attractive area for shoppers.
If the past is any indication, he will have his hands full trying to accommodate the conflicting needs of the traditional Lower East Side businesses, the newer merchants, bars and restaurants, and the neighborhood's residents.
"I don't know anything about the new guy," said David Troutman, a community organizer, but he said that in the past, the district had "pushed aside the wishes of some of the smaller businesses, and certainly the wishes of some of the residents." One continuing problem, he said, is that the neighborhood has too many noisy bars.
"We want some community planning," said Clayton Patterson, a longtime resident. "We want to see greengrocers. We want to see things that benefit the community at large, not just people who don't live here, and rent out their property for the maximum amount of money."
Mr. Flamm said, "My goals are much the same as his." He added that one long-term plan is to work with the Essex Street Market to create a low-cost business incubator for high-quality food vendors. Other plans include finishing projects started by his predecessor, such as decorating the medians on Delancey and Allen Streets, installing bishop's-crook light fixtures and planting more trees.

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
Cola Makers Leave Their Bottlers Flat

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS

 BODY:
COCA-COLA, the soft drink, is based on a closely guarded secret formula. But the arithmetic that results when Coca-Cola, the company, decides to squeeze more profit from its complex relationships with its bottlers was laid bare last week.
On Friday, shares of Coca-Cola Enterprises, in which Coca-Cola holds a 39 percent stake, closed at $18.375, less than half their 52-week high of $37.50. The share price of Coca-Cola Consolidated, the No. 2 Coke bottler in the United States, closed at $49.75, down 13.5 percent for the year. 
 This had already been a bad year for the bottling stocks, but it became worse last month. That was when an executive of Coca-Cola Enterprises disclosed that Coca-Cola was raising the price it charges for concentrate -- the powder or syrup that is mixed with water and carbon dioxide to become soft drinks -- by 7 percent, twice the usual rate. The move was seen as Coke's attempt to capture some of the profit that the bottlers were anticipating from a price increase they initiated earlier this year at the wholesale level.
For Summerfield Johnston Jr., the chairman and second-largest shareholder of Coca-Cola Enterprises, a result has been this: In early June, his 28.6 million shares were worth about $1.07 billion; the value of that stake has been whittled down to about $525 million.
"I would say he's not a happy camper on this whole thing," said Emanuel Goldman, an analyst at Merrill Lynch. The unhappiness of bottlers like Mr. Johnston -- whose opinions carry some weight at Coca-Cola -- may have been a factor in the departure of M. Douglas Ivester, Coca-Cola's chief executive. Mr. Ivester stunned investors last week with the news that he was stepping down in April.
The concentrate price increase was imitated over at Pepsi-Cola a short time later. And for the Pepsi system, it has been the same story: shares in Pepsi Bottling, the company spun off from PepsiCo earlier this year, are now at $16, after trading as high as $25.25 in July. And the Whitman Corporation, another major Pepsi bottler, now trades at $13.125, down 48 percent for the year.
The stock prices of the concentrate companies, however, have fared better. Coca-Cola closed on Friday at $63.25, down just 5.6 percent for the year, while PepsiCo closed at $36.9375, down 9.6 percent.
Does all this mean that investors should avoid bottling stocks? Not necessarily, say some money managers and analysts.
"The upside isn't limited if you are a long-term value player," said Scott Black, the president of Delphi Management, which is among the top five stakeholders in Coca-Cola Consolidated and has a stake in Pepsi Bottling. "You're getting exclusive territorial franchises, a business that generates lots of cash, and very low multiples." With cash flow growth of 10 percent or so in good times, the stocks are attractive.
Mr. Goldman said he thought all the bottling stocks had been oversold. He has 12-month price targets of $40 on Coca-Cola Enterprises, $31 on Pepsi Bottling and $16 on Whitman.
A spokesman for Pepsi Bottling, which announced the Pepsi-Cola concentrate price increase last month, said the timing was right as long as PepsiCo made marketing-support payments to the bottler. "Consumers have to want what we make, sell and deliver," said the spokesman, Larry Jabbonsky.
The relationship between the concentrate companies and their bottlers has been a concern on Wall Street. Many investors want to see a more equitable distribution of profits between the two sides; historically, more of the profit has accrued to the concentrate makers, whose margins are extremely high. Returns on invested capital have also been far higher for the concentrate companies than for the bottlers.
STILL, there seems to be some confusion, said Paul Rissman, a senior vice president at Alliance Capital Management, who recently added to stakes in Coca-Cola Enterprises and Pepsi Bottling, both of which he calls "incredibly cheap."
"If the concentrate companies were to intend to rob some of the profits from the bottlers, they'd just be cutting off their noses," he said. "We think they know that. We think they are trying to reach agreements with the bottlers where they can both make money."
Companies like Coca-Cola have urged ever-higher volume from their bottlers, and stand to benefit from increased concentrate sales. But there has been a big cost to bottlers around the world, said Andrew J. Conway, an analyst for Morgan Stanley.
In a note to investors published last week, Mr. Conway assessed Mr. Ivester's contributions and generally gave him high marks. However, he said volume growth targets of 7 to 8 percent -- which Mr. Ivester's successor, Douglas N. Daft, said he planned to pursue -- had a distinct downside.
"Mr. Ivester's targets have led to an unprecedented rate of bottler investment in plants, trucks, machinery and coolers," Mr. Conway wrote. "Given the global economic slowdown, this rate of investment was well ahead of the volume curve that has emerged. In turn, this has left many global bottlers with subpar returns on invested capital."

Sleepy Steps For Japan After a Long Hibernation

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
WHEN Commodore Perry parked his big black ships at the mouth of what is now Tokyo Bay nearly 150 years ago and demanded entry, Japan was still a feudal society.
At the moment, Japan appears to be tentatively emerging from a more modern version of the Dark Ages, an economic recession that has lasted for most of the decade. More important, the rigidity that has been the hallmark of its postwar economic structure appears to be cracking. 
 Politicians are talking about doing things that have been going on elsewhere for years: privatization, deregulation, restructuring, promoting competition.
Foreign direct investment, never very popular in Japan, is rising. The banking system is being reformed. And some big companies that used to guarantee lifetime employment are announcing layoffs.
Such developments have not gone unnoticed: the Topix stock index is up nearly 50 percent this year.
P. Nicholas Edwards, a managing director and head of the Warburg Pincus Japan Growth fund, talked about the Japan that seems to be emerging from the rubble. Following are excerpts from the conversation:
 
Q. Numbers released in Tokyo last week suggest that after two periods of very modest expansion, Japan's economy contracted a bit in the third quarter. After being so weak for so long, are conditions still that fragile?
 
A. The numbers were badly reported in the U.S. The headline number was worse than expected, although that was largely due to the fact that prices as measured by the gross domestic product deflator fell more than they had in the second quarter. In real terms, the economy grew at just under a 1 percent annual rate, up from 0.6 percent in the previous quarter.
Over the next 18 months, the economy won't show tremendous growth. It will grind through that period with growth of somewhere between 0.5 percent and 1 percent. Two years down the road, the economy should really accelerate.
 
Q. What about the Japanese consumer, who unlike his Western counterparts would rather save money instead of spend it?
 
A. The consumer is feeling more buoyant than he was, but that is a relative judgment, because he was very depressed a year ago.
Computer sales are up 57 percent year-over-year, and last month car registrations turned positive for the first time in 32 months. Consumers don't feel ebullient, but they do feel a bit better and there is a constructive view going forward.
 
Q. That is not exactly the sort of economic outlook that should excite investors. Yet the stock market is doing better. Why?
 
A. The story about Japan and the stock market -- and it has been a tremendous year if you were in the right areas -- is about Japan feeling its way to the creation of the new economy which surrounds the Internet and telecommunications and restructuring. Some companies are working very hard and are very focused on improving value for shareholders. Others are less focused.
 
Q. Which companies best symbolize this new Japan?
 
A. I refer to them as the Three Musketeers -- Softbank, NTT Mobile Communications Network and Hikari Tsushin. Those companies symbolize the growth in the telecommunications and Internet sector in Japan.
 
Q. Any other companies that come to mind?
 
A. Sony and Fujitsu have done well. But it is really a sector thing. A number, including telecommunications, electronics, specialty retailers and securities brokers, have done well. The rest have underperformed. Fifteen of the 33 groups of stocks in Japan are down for the year. Steel, mining, foods,
warehousing are all the boring old sectors.
 
Q. What is your 2000 market forecast?
 
A. The outlook is not quite as good, but the basic premises of the thesis remain sound: by continuing to invest selectively in the winners one should continue to do quite well.
 
Q. In the depths of the Asian crisis, it was commonly held that the rest of Asia couldn't recover without a vigorous Japan. Things don't seem to be panning out quite that way.
 
A. The fact that the economy has gone from negative to positive growth, and that the currency is stronger, has been positive for the region. It may be a while before Japan becomes an engine again, but Asia looks quite good because Japan looks better.
 
Q. Japan is a very traditional society with entrenched elites. What are the chances the forces that represent those elites, and the old economy, will prevail over those who represent the new economy?
 
A. There is validity in the fact that there are forces of conservatism in the country. But there is zero chance the old will win out over the new.
Culture is irrelevant. If you compare Great Britain of the 1950's through the early 1970's to today, it is apples and oranges. At the moment, Japan is probably halfway through its transformation.

HEADLINE: The World;
Syria Grabs A Moment To Bargain

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: BEIRUT

 BODY:
AMERICANS have never quite figured out Hafez al-Assad. Most see him as a kind of tyrant, even a terrorist -- a leader who supports extremists abroad and suppresses opponents at home. As rendered on those oversized Soviet-style posters, he can look the part of a dinosaur, a relic from a pre-global, pre-millennial, pre-New Middle East past.
There is truth to that image; Mr. Assad has a record of ruthlessness, though most of it dates from more than a decade ago. But he has also ruled with finesse, willing to forgive some foes when the reward is stability. 
 Until he took power in a 1969 coup, Syria was fractious; under Mr. Assad, that problem was solved by imposing iron rule rather than democracy; still, that brought the gift of stability.
Little wonder, then, that Mr. Assad has long been seen as the Arab neighbor with whom Israel most wants to make peace. The reason has only a little to do with Syria's military strength, which is now faded, and almost everything to do with Mr. Assad himself. More than any of his Arab counterparts, he is seen as a man who understands both power and survival. And he has a record of keeping what few bargains he has struck with Israel. So he is viewed as someone who, if he made a deal, would make one that sticks.
In addition, he has a great deal to say about what happens in Lebanon, which ended its civil war in the 1980's only by turning to Syria as a power broker and inviting in its army. Lebanon remains a base for guerrilla attacks on Israel, which keeps control of a tense buffer zone that is the scene of frequent bloodshed.
That is why, for more than a decade, one of the biggest questions in the Middle East has been when Mr. Assad might see advantage in aggressively seeking a deal. With the surprise announcement last week that he was ready to send his foreign minister to Washington to meet with Israel's prime minister, a new question looms: Might this really be the moment?
There is good reason to think so, and not just because of the small shift in his stance that opened the way toward peace talks when Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright visited Damascus early in the week.
Behind that shift lies a broader sense not only of new opportunity, but of urgency.
Until early this year, Mr. Assad had always carried himself as if time did not matter. He had prided himself on his refusal to compromise; to win peace, Israel would have to withdraw from every inch of the Golan Heights. In recent months, his government had gone further, saying that even to restart talks, Israel would have to publicly commit itself to borders that existed before the 1967 war, something Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, would not do.
But Mr. Assad is 69 now and clearly ill. Since early this year, he has seemed preoccupied by a need to cement the position of his son, Bashar, 34, as his heir apparent, and his decision to return to the talks without such a public Israeli commitment suggests a further recognition that it would be foolhardy to wait too long.
Perhaps Mr. Assad feels peace with Israel would guarantee his place in history. But perhaps more important, it could transform Syria's domestic environment to his son's advantage. The younger Mr. Assad is a staff colonel but has little military experience and lacks the confidence of the former Baath Party bosses and long-serving generals. His strength is his close ties with Syria's business community. So it seems logical that a Syria at peace, with an eye on prosperity rather than security, would be a far easier place in which to establish himself in power.
To Syrian ears, another clock has begun to tick more loudly than ever -- the one marking progress toward a final Israeli-Palestinian peace. With the Israelis and Palestinians now pledging to wind up their final peace talks by late next year, President Assad does not want to find himself shut completely out of the circle of peace -- including decisions to be made on the fate of Palestinian refugees, more than 500,000 of whom now live in Syria or Lebanon.
The winding down of President Clinton's last term is yet another ticking clock, this one measuring how long the White House might be willing to put pressure on Israel to cement Mr. Clinton's own legacy.
Mr. Assad, of course, has been here before. The talks in Washington are to begin "at the point where they left off" nearly four years ago, when Israel walked out after Islamic militants launched a bus-bombing campaign in Israel, soon to be followed by an all-out conflict in southern Lebanon between Israeli forces and the Syrian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas.
That history shows how easily peace can be sidetracked by violence. But this time, as Mr. Assad clearly recognizes, changes in the Middle East have presented Syria with better opportunities -- particularly in Lebanon -- to untangle itself from its conflicts.
As one price for peace, Israel has made clear its demand that Syria rein in Hezbollah, the Lebanese guerrillas whose attacks on Israeli forces and towns have been used by Damascus to put pressure on Israel. But doing that is not like turning off a tap.
ARMED by Iran and fueled by Iranian-inspired ardor, the guerrillas are subject only to indirect Syrian control. Four years ago, a Syrian attempt to shut them down almost surely would have been met with open rebellion from some, at least. But this is not the Lebanon of four years ago, in part because Iran, too, has changed. The Revolutionary Guards who once trained militants in the art of terror in Lebanon's lawless Bekaa Valley have long since departed. And since Mohammed Khatami assumed Iran's presidency in 1997, he has been trying to put an end to Iran's isolation, even though he still faces opposition on that score from very powerful conservatives. That power struggle in Tehran presumably gives Mr. Assad some room to maneuver if he wants to curb the militants.
Last summer, Mr. Assad's government warned Palestinian militants based in Syria that if peace were to come, it would be time to find a new line of work. Through Bashar Assad, Syria later sent the same message to Hezbollah. Among diplomats in Lebanon, the betting is that if peace were to come soon, the message would be heeded.
Of course, even if the new road leads to peace, the path is unlikely to be straight. Syria and Israel have been enemies for 50 years, and much distrust still lies between them. Many skeptics in Israel and the United States think Mr. Assad's opening was just a sucker bid, intended to lure Israel into a big concession or, perhaps, to persuade the United States to end sanctions.
Mr. Assad's associates say he frowns on the theatrics that have come to be associated with Middle East peacemaking. Still, simply by dispatching Farouk al-Shara, his foreign minister and closest adviser, to Washington this week, Mr. Assad knows that he is sending a new signal; never before has so a high-ranking a Syrian official held direct talks with an Israeli delegation. If Mr. Assad himself joins any talks, diplomats here guess, it will not be until the final moments, when a deal is ready to be signed. But for the first time in memory, the diplomats say, that prospect now seems more real than fanciful.

HEADLINE: In the Workplace, Who's Taking From Whom?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Big Theft, Small Theft: Is There a Difference?" (The Right Thing, Nov. 21), in which Jeffrey L. Seglin discussed the ethical issues surrounding employees' thefts from companies -- and whether the taking of company property is justified, for example, if the company has stolen the employee's personal time:
I think the column was correct in calling for flexibility and reasonable discretion in dealing with such issues, but it provided no specific guidance. 
 That, of course, is the basic problem with flexibility: when we don't have some agreed-upon ideas on where to draw the lines, many people will go too far.
One helpful standard might be this: Does a given behavior increase or decrease the total resources available to everyone?
For example, if I make a phone call from my desk to make a dental appointment, it takes about a minute. If I wait until my break and go downstairs and use a pay phone, it takes about 10 minutes, costs a quarter and makes it hard to write the appointment on my calendar.
The inefficiencies that would be required to strictly devote every working second to one's work make no sense -- there would be fewer hours for useful activities.
On the other hand, when employees devote large chunks of job time to personal business or schmoozing, it is hard not to believe that everyone is made worse off. The biggest costs in most businesses are for labor. An employer with inefficient workers is simply not going to produce enough revenues to afford high wages.

HEADLINE: Critical Shortage of Lawyers for Poor Seen

BYLINE: By DAVID ROHDE

 BODY:
A shortage of lawyers willing to represent New York City's poor is reaching "crisis proportions" and creating "chaotic, delay-ridden" courts, the state's chief administrative judge is warning.
In Criminal Court, the lack of lawyers has forced dozens of defendants to spend six months to a year in jail awaiting trial, largely because no court-appointed lawyers have been available. One defendant has spent more than two years awaiting trial, court officials said. 
 "We're at a real turning point in terms of being able to find adequate defense representation to keep the system going," said the judge, Jonathan Lippman.
In Family Court, where the appointed lawyers represent poor parents in foster care disputes and custody cases, up to 50 parents are sent home each week because no lawyer is available, court officials said.
In a rare show of unanimity, judges, prosecutors, defense lawyers and the Giuliani administration agree that the court-appointed defense system needs a drastic overhaul.
The heart of the problem is a long-troubled, $52 million program that has soared in size and importance as a result of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's effort to reduce the influence of the Legal Aid Society, the city's largest criminal defense organization for the poor, which has a staff of salaried lawyers. The program, the Assigned Counsel Plan, was created in 1965 to match private defense lawyers with indigent defendants in murder cases and a few other cases the Legal Aid Society could not handle.
In the wake of the mayor's successful breaking of a 1994 strike by Legal Aid lawyers and a surge in quality-of-life arrests, the number of poor people represented by the program has surged to more than 80,000 a year. Self-employed lawyers now handle about half of the criminal cases in the system, and the remainder is split among the Legal Aid Society and other nonprofit groups. The assigned-counsel program now handles more criminal cases than the Legal Aid Society.
But the program, which has long been dogged by accusations of shoddy work and overbilling, is providing its lowest-quality legal representation in decades, according to criminal justice officials. Experienced lawyers are leaving the program, complaining that caseloads are soaring and fees have not been increased in 13 years. And budding lawyers are failing to enroll in the program because of its low pay and a declining interest in public service work, law professors said.
The number of lawyers actively participating in the program in Criminal Court has plummeted from roughly 1,000 a decade ago to less than 500 today.
"We are unable to keep many of our most highly qualified and most experienced lawyers," said Harvey Fishbein, a lawyer who heads the program's screening committee in Manhattan and the Bronx. "And the attorneys that remain on the panel are overwhelmed by the number of cases."
The state court system, prosecutors' association, bar association, attorney general and City Hall support a $70 million proposal by Chief Judge Judith S. Kaye to overhaul the program by doubling the lawyers' fees.
But Judge Kaye's proposal, which was unveiled in June, has received tepid support in Albany. John McArdle, a spokesman for Joseph L. Bruno, the State Senate majority leader, said Mr. Bruno opposed the plan because of financing concerns.
Aides to Gov. George E. Pataki and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver said they had not taken positions on the proposal. Legal experts and participants in the program said that because it serves criminal defendants, the poor and members of minorities, winning support is difficult.
Judges, prosecutors and participants agree that the program's inability to attract lawyers stems from its low pay. Lawyers are paid $25 to $40 an hour for their work with indigent clients, one of the lowest rates in the country. Federal court-appointed work pays nearly twice as much -- $75 an hour -- and private defense lawyers can earn from $150 to $500 an hour. A few lawyers who devote their practices to such cases are forced to work out of their homes.
Lawyers with successful private practices who take only a few court-appointed cases warn that the low fees invite incompetence and fraud. "No competent criminal defense lawyer zealously representing his clients can make a living on those rates," said Ronald Kuby, a Manhattan defense lawyer. "So you either cut corners, do huge volume or inflate your hours."
Chester Mirsky, a professor at New York University Law School, said higher fees might not be enough to attract more lawyers to the program. He said the defense system for indigents needs to be revamped and new ways must be found to attract young lawyers.
Anthony Ricco, a court-appointed Manhattan defense lawyer whom judges and administrators describe as the kind of experienced trial lawyer the program needs to retain, said the low fees have forced him to shift the bulk of his court-appointed work to federal cases. "I can't survive economically on the rates," Mr. Ricco said. "They are horrendous."
Morale among the lawyers who remain in the program is at rock bottom. "You truly have to be crazy to do this," said Susan Tipograph, a Manhattan lawyer who has worked in the program since 1977 and helps administer it. "You get abused by judges and you get abused by clients because they think you must be a bad lawyer because you're doing this kind of work."
The lack of lawyers interested in the program results in cases like that of Jeffrey Martinez, a Bronx man who has spent two years and three months waiting in jail for his trial on murder charges. Patrick Watts, Mr. Martinez's court-appointed lawyer, said the case was initially handled by another court-appointed lawyer, who became ill. He added that he had been too busy defending other indigent clients to bring Mr. Martinez's case to trial.
Low-level cases generated by the mayor's crackdown on quality-of-life crimes contribute to the problem. Swamped court-appointed lawyers sometimes fail to appear when their clients are in court. The no-shows delay a resolution of the case and clog the system, judges said.
In the Manhattan Family Court building, where distraught and weeping parents are a grim fixture, clients complained that overworked lawyers were unable to pay serious attention to their cases. Margaret Pacheco, a 45-year-old Manhattan woman on methadone whose 4-year-old son, Frankie, was placed in foster care last year, broke into tears on Friday when describing her efforts to win back custody of her son.
"They try, but there is so much pressure on them," she said, referring to her lawyers. "We can't afford to get a real lawyer, so we end up losing out."
New state regulations that require some children to be put up for adoption within a year of being placed in foster care will exacerbate the problem, court officials and lawyers say.
Edwina Richardson, a court-appointed lawyer from Brooklyn who works in Family Court, concurred. "You're dealing with the fundamental right of being able to raise your children," she said. "When there is a delay in talking to an attorney or there is a delay in even getting an attorney in that type of case, parents are justifiably upset."

HEADLINE: THE NEEDIEST CASES;
Rising Above Obstacles With Custom-Made Help

BYLINE: By NINA SIEGAL

 BODY:
Mary L. Robinson cannot remember when she and her husband split up. It might have been before she was hit by the white sedan. It might have been after. The two events had nothing to do with each other, except one meant the end of suffering, and the other marked its beginning.
Ms. Robinson, who is now 48, says she was abused for a decade by her second husband, who assaulted her and so demoralized her that she tried to take her own life three times. Her only respite was work, she said. Although she had not finished high school, she proudly held down a job as a receptionist and word processor at SUNY Downstate Medical Center in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn. 
 But in 1990, as she was crossing a street in Crown Heights, the Brooklyn neighborhood where she lived, a car ran a red light and hit Ms. Robinson, who rolled onto the hood of the car, her spine fractured.
While she was recovering, she received government assistance that allowed her to continue caring for her two children, then 6 and 7. The physical loss was devastating, Ms. Robinson said, but it was the psychological blow that took the greatest toll.
"I went, like, down," she said. "I lost confidence in myself, and I didn't want to be around people or have anyone around me, even my family. I didn't want to leave the house. I just wanted to be alone."
Ms. Robinson knew she wanted to get off welfare, but she did not know how.
She had once signed up for workfare, but her first assignment was removing garbage from the side of highways. Not only was she unsettled by the cars roaring by, which reminded her of her accident, but the arduous labor also made her back pain flare up. She did not even last a day.
It is a new initiative of the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service, one of seven local charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, that will help Ms. Robinson find a job she can succeed in. The program, Pride 2000, which started in July, serves 1,000 to 1,200 disabled welfare recipients from Brooklyn each year.
Two days a week at the program, Ms. Robinson gets computer training and attends classes to prepare for the G.E.D., the General Educational Development Test. She gets hands-on work experience as a receptionist three days a week. While completing Pride 2000, which the agency calls work-based education, Ms. Robinson is also offered counseling and workshops in building self-esteem.
Wayman M. Young, director of Pride 2000, said: "Many of the people in the program have not worked before, and those who have usually have disabilities or medical conditions which prevent them from working at their former occupations. So, you need to create an atmosphere that is conducive to their making a slow transition back to the workplace."
Mr. Young said the program focuses on each client, because many of the welfare recipients have a particular set of barriers to employment.
"We do individual service plans, because one size does not fit all," he said. "It requires a customized fitting, so to speak, and a customized growth of that fitting."
In addition to the Brooklyn Bureau's efforts, there are various other programs among the charities supported by the Neediest Cases Fund to assist welfare recipients and other people who have had trouble entering the work force -- whether because of disability, language difficulties or lack of educational skills.
Many people served by job programs supported by the Neediest Cases Fund need this kind of personal attention, experts say.
Since federal and state welfare agencies began revamping programs to move recipients from welfare to work, many families have been able to enter the nation's work force, through a combination of job training, motivational workshops and the added incentive of looming time limits for receiving benefits under the 1996 welfare legislation.
But many people still on public assistance face severe obstacles to employment, said Barry Van Lare, executive director of the Welfare Information Network, a nonprofit national clearinghouse based in Washington.
At the time of the 1996 legislation, Mr. Van Lare said, it was estimated that about a third of people receiving assistance would be able to get off the rolls with minimal support from the public sector. Another third were considered more difficult cases, he said, and the others were categorized as people with severe impediments to finding work. As the more employable segment of welfare recipients moved off the rolls, those in the "severe impediments" category became a much more significant portion of the whole. Sheila R. Zedlewski, director of the Income and Benefits Policy Center at the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan nonprofit group in Washington, said they make up 40 percent to 50 percent of current recipients.
Mr. Van Lare said: "What we're all observing is that lots of people who have barriers are able to get to work, but there are still lots of people who have multiple barriers who can't get off the rolls. Of those who don't succeed early on, many are going to require more intensive and extensive services."
It took a certain amount of hand-holding to help Ms. Robinson get back on her feet. Even as she tells her story, her eyes dart across the room to Juana Tellado, her case manager, who has guided her through classes, work and some of the painful memories that haunt her.
"If she can talk about her life and her whole experience, that's an important part of change," Ms. Tellado said. "If she's willing to open herself and say, 'I was hurting myself when someone else was hurting me,' to me that's an indication that you're building self-esteem."
 
Language
For Many Immigrants, The Biggest Hurdle
For Dianna P., 43, a single mother who lives in the Sheepshead Bay section of Brooklyn, the biggest hurdle from welfare to work was the English language. When Dianna (who does not want to use her full name because she does not want people to know that she was receiving welfare) immigrated to the United States from Odessa, Ukraine, a year ago, she received $277 a month, and six weeks' worth of classes in English as a second language from the refugee support program of the New York Association for New Americans, a nonprofit agency for immigrants. But she did not become proficient enough to navigate the job market.
Everywhere she applied for work, she said, the answer was, "We'll call you."
"I was ready for this situation," she said through a translator. "I understood I was a new person for this country, and I tried not to be disappointed." But it was discouraging nonetheless.
Although Dianna had been a bookkeeper in Odessa, the best job she could find with her limited English skills was cleaning houses and caring for the elderly. When her refugee support ran out, she went on welfare for seven months, receiving $468, plus food stamps, each month to care for herself and her son, who is now 15.
Then one day a few months ago, she saw an advertisement in a Brooklyn newspaper about a job opportunity for recent Russian immigrants at MetCouncil Employment Services, a program of the Metropolitan New York Coordinating Council on Jewish Poverty, a beneficiary of the UJA-Federation of New York, a charity supported by the Neediest Cases Fund. The employment program serves recent immigrants, victims of domestic abuse and former welfare recipients.
When Swiss banks admitted earlier this year that they had helped the Nazis hoard money and property stolen from Jews during World War II, the MetCouncil created a program to help Holocaust survivors file compensation claims with the banks. The organization was hiring people who could help the survivors -- many of whom are elderly and do not speak English -- manage complicated paperwork and legal issues so they could apply for some of the $1.25 billion in settlement funds.
Dianna went to MetCouncil and got a job fielding calls from Russian-speaking Holocaust survivors, answering complex questions about application guidelines. But the organization did more than just set her up with employment. While working 20 hours a week, she was also offered English-language instruction four hours every weeknight through the agency. She now makes enough money to support herself and her son without welfare.
The coordinating council serves at least 1,200 Russian-speaking clients every year at nine sites in Brooklyn, Manhattan and Queens, said Sandra Greenstein, director of employment and training programs for the MetCouncil. Limited English skills can become more than just a practical obstacle to finding employment, Ms. Greenstein said, because when recent immigrants cannot communicate effectively, they feel dependent on the services, like welfare, that they know they can count on.
"For the person who doesn't speak the language and is from another country, they're so frightened anyway it's so hard to tell them, 'Don't worry, we'll help you out when you don't have benefits,' " she explained. "Just think, you don't even have the ability to defend yourself in your own language. It's like having a gag in your mouth."
She said most of her Russian-speaking clients preferred to find jobs outside their community because they wanted to assimilate as quickly as possible. But some use their native language skills while they learning English.
"They just have to get a job first," Ms. Greenstein said. "And yet they are very career-minded, so we'll continue to help them as they get off welfare."
For her part, Dianna is happy to continue working within the Russian community, and pleased to have switched careers from bookkeeping to social work.
"Here, I can improve my English and at the same time, I can work with Russian people and help them out," she said. "That's the most important thing."
Although Dianna had found a job, her money troubles were not quite over. Jackie Ebron, director of crisis intervention services for the coordinating council, said Dianna got stuck in a Catch-22 of the welfare system. Her food stamps and most of her other entitlements were cut off before she got her first paycheck. She feared that she would lose her apartment and be unable to feed her son in the intervening month -- or months, who could be sure?
Dianna had no source of income for a month and a half, but she was too ashamed, Ms. Ebron said, to ask for help. Ultimately, Ms. Ebron, noticing Dianna's distress, asked what was wrong. Dianna explained her situation. That was when the coordinating council used money from the Neediest Cases Fund to keep Dianna and her son afloat. The fund provided a month's rent, money for medicine, food, clothes and other basic needs. It also gave the family a food voucher and a food package so that Dianna could return home every day knowing she and her son could make it to payday.
With that help, Dianna has been able to remain in the work force, doing what she loves. "If I hadn't come here, I don't know what I would do," she said on Wednesday. "But I'm glad I met these people here, because I must work. I must do it for my son."
 
Education
Lack of the Basics Keeps People on Rolls
What prevents most welfare recipients from leaving the public assistance rolls is a lack of basic education, said Julie Strawn, senior policy analyst at the Center for Law and Social Policy, a nonprofit research and advocacy organization based in Washington. According to a recent study of current welfare recipients by the Urban Institute, 41 percent do not have a high school degree or equivalent, and 43 percent have no work experience or have not worked in more than three years.
Michael Dykes, 33, was receiving Supplemental Security Income, a form of federal public assistance for the disabled, ever since he could remember. His disability is not physical; he has so much trouble reading that he is categorized as learning disabled. Mr. Dykes, who grew up in Pittsburgh and moved to the Bronx three years ago, had to repeat three years of school and then dropped out of high school at age 20, when the school's principal told him he would never graduate, he said.
For several years, he worked for a private garbage-hauling company, then for two supermarkets, and finally as a bouncer and security guard. But, he said, by the time he was 22, he was unemployed. "I lost all those jobs," he said. "Some closed; some went out of business; others, I don't know."
At 24 he was living with his mother and began drinking heavily and using cocaine. When his addictions led him to steal from her, she turned him out, and he soon landed in jail. When he got out, he had nowhere to turn but the Salvation Army, where he now shares a room with two other men. Although he managed to conquer his addiction on his own, he said, he still could not find a job.
He turned to Exodus House of the Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York, which runs a job-training program for the homeless, former prisoners and victims of domestic violence, among others. Three months ago, Catholic Charities also began a new job training program, the Millennium Career Opportunities Project, which provides 30 people with practical job-seeking skills, like resume preparation, practice interviews and computer training.
Exodus House also has an education outreach program, a series of workshops that lasts 12 weeks and includes classes on setting priorities and achieving personal goals. Clients are matched with mentors who help them deal with the problems that have kept them out of the work force in the past. And as part of a self-esteem building program, at the end of the 12 weeks, clients must tell their life stories to a group of their peers.
Exodus House also offers a literacy program, G.E.D. training, individual tutoring, a job-readiness program and classes in English as a second language. There is also a job retention program, guiding clients through precarious job issues and offering strategies for managing conflict in the workplace.
Mr. Dykes joined Exodus House last year, completed a job readiness program and then joined the education outreach program this fall. Alison H. Kelsick, the director of Exodus House, said it was hard to find him a job because he could not read or write. Mr. Dykes said he is learning how to read, and hopes to earn an equivalency diploma. The hardest part of the program, he said, was writing his life story for the final presentation.
"It was stuff I didn't want to bring up," he said. "But I got some stuff that was really hurting off my chest. Like my brother dying, and losing a lot of people I care about."
On Tuesday night, Mr. Dykes waited nervously outside the chapel on the Fordham University campus at West 60th Street before "Speakers Night," in which several Exodus House clients shared some of their most difficult life stories. Mr. Dykes will tell his own story at another ceremony, but that night he was introducing another participant. He knew what he had to say, but he swallowed his words as he talked about the mentor who had helped him figure out how to get his teeth fixed, and how to think about the future.
"This is about telling your story and accomplishing your goals," he said, glancing inside the chapel. "One of mine is to go back to school and bring up my reading and try to move myself forward. Before, I never used to have goals for myself. Or if I did, I never met them. Now I feel I can."
Mr. Dykes still has a long path ahead of him before he will find permanent, stable employment. But he has overcome one of the first barriers to getting there, he said -- his own fear.
Like Mr. Dykes, many welfare recipients who have severe practical barriers to employment face another challenge that can be just as daunting: they lack confidence that once they get a job they will be able to keep it. Most say their greatest fear is escaping welfare only to find that they cannot make ends meet without it, and having to reapply for benefits.
For some people, like Dianna, the Neediest Cases Funds came at a critical time, when she needed an extra boost to get across the income gulf between the welfare system and the workplace. For others, like Mr. Dykes and Ms. Robinson, the important contribution the Neediest Cases Fund makes is helping to support programs that will accompany them on the entire journey from public assistance, through job preparation and into stable employment, and, if needed, beyond. In most cases, it is this assurance that makes leaving the rolls possible at all.
Ms. Robinson, who has wrestled with her feelings of inadequacy, said joining the work force has made a tremendous difference, and not just for her pocketbook.
"Oh, I love it here," she said last week of the Brooklyn Bureau's welfare-to-work program, Pride 2000. "It seemed like before this program I wasn't going anywhere. I just kept going down and down. Now I'm coming up. It's slowly, but I'm definitely coming up."

Invoking the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and his own Southern roots, Vice President Al Gore came to a historic black section of Atlanta today to begin a nationalwide effort to encourage African-Americans to turn out for him at the polls, both in the primaries and next November.
"The other side is counting on blowing the roof off all of the election finance and breaking all the records and lining up all of the special interests," Mr. Gore declared in a speech rife with biblical cadences after entering to the throbbing beat of "Love Train," which is fast becoming his campaign theme song. 
 "Well, I can tell you that here in the South," he said, "we have the capacity to blow the roof off voter registration and turnout and grass-roots enthusiasm."
In contrast to his failed 1988 presidential bid, when he campaigned as a candidate of the South, Mr. Gore rarely mentions the South this time around, presenting himself as a national candidate. But he talked today of the special bond that Southern whites have with blacks.
"We, especially those of us here in the South, are intensely proud of what we have done together," he said, lauding "those who took the blows, shed blood that was redemptive for our nation."
The Gore campaign considers the black vote crucial to the vice president's ability to stave off former Senator Bill Bradley, especially with several Southern states holding primaries in March.
Donna Brazile, the Gore campaign manager, said blacks usually make up more than a fourth of the turnout in Democratic primaries in the South. Most surveys show Mr. Gore with a substantial lead among African-Americans over Mr. Bradley, who has made his own efforts to attract black voters. The goal, Gore advisers said, will be to get them to the polls.
Mr. Gore has been courting black voters for years, but today his campaign began a nationwide push.
With simultaneous events in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Des Moines, the campaign announced the support of nearly 3,000 African-Americans, most of whom have already endorsed him. They included elected officials and members of the clergy as well as the singer Aretha Franklin and the comedian Bill Cosby and athletes like Shaquille O'Neal and Carl Lewis.
Mr. Gore chose to kick off his campaign for the black vote in Atlanta, where the black community's roots run deep and because Georgia is the first Southern state to vote in a primary, on March 7.
The timing of today's events reflected the quickly advancing primary schedule and the fact that the candidates are in the process of fielding delegates in several Northern states with significant black populations, including New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Illinois.
Mr. Gore spoke this morning in the small auditorium of the Atlanta Life Insurance building on Auburn Avenue, just up the street from the Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Dr. King preached and is buried. The life insurance company was started by a former slave, Alonzo Herndon, in 1905 and became a cornerstone of black businesses in the area.
Mr. Gore was praised by a succession of black politicians, who cited his support for affirmative action, his father's support for civil rights and, mostly, the Clinton administration's record in reducing crime, reducing black unemployment, helping more blacks attend college and appointing a record number of blacks to jobs in the administration.
Mr. Gore's supporters today included Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia. Mr. Lewis reminded the audience that the Georgia primary fell on the 35th anniversary of the civil rights march in Alabama from Selma to Montgomery, a coincidence that the Gore campaign intends to exploit.
"Some of our sisters and brothers died for the right to vote," Mr. Lewis told the audience. "On March 7, we will go to the polls and we will vote like we never, ever voted before, and then in November 2000 we will come back to the polls and vote again."
Mr. Gore told the crowd: "I make you this pledge. Together, with your enthusiasm, your ideas and your commitment, we're going to win this nomination."
"The next president is going to appoint three to four justices of the Supreme Court," Mr. Gore said. "What would Thurgood Marshall have thought if he took his historic cases to a Supreme Court that was stacked with ideological right wingers predisposed to say no?"
He added: "Anyone who says affirmative action is no longer needed because we've reached the promised land has confused the wilderness with Canaan."

HEADLINE: CHARITY FOR POOR LAGS BEHIND NEED

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

 BODY:
As incomes of the better-off Americans rise in this age of prosperity, with the stock market and corporate profits booming, charities report that both individuals and companies are donating less to organizations that support the homeless, the young and the hungry than they did in leaner times.
Leading charitable organizations like the Salvation Army and United Way say that as a result, they are struggling with a surging demand for their aid, and that the private donations they collect are falling far short of the need. 
 "What is so stunning to me is that people in America have this image of prosperity and everybody benefits," said Deborah Leff, president of America's Second Harvest in Chicago, which oversees a network of 189 community food banks nationwide that distribute nearly $400 million in donated food to 26 million people.
Ms. Leff said contributions to Second Harvest's $10 million annual budget have been rising but by nowhere near enough to meet the demand. "I think people just aren't aware of the need," she said. "They think of hunger as a distended stomach in some developing country. That's starvation, not hunger."
Tom Jones, director of development and national spokesman for the Salvation Army, the nation's biggest charity, said, "In this era of prosperity, need continues to skyrocket, especially in the major cities." Giving to the Salvation Army is up in some cities and down in others but nowhere does it meet the need, Mr. Jones said.
"I continue to hear from places like Memphis and Houston of how many more people are coming to ask for help in paying their rent or utility bills," he said. "The army is facing not only more need but a more complex kind of need," in serving more and more families than single adults.
Paul Clolery, editor of NonProfit Times, a newspaper for executives of nonprofit groups,said, "Demand for services is through the roof."
The travails of the nation's purest charities -- those, unlike colleges, museums, hospitals and churches, that serve the indigent exclusively -- clash with evidence of a slowly falling poverty rate, rising incomes, and the overhaul of the welfare system three years ago that has coaxed many recipients into jobs. The charities say that with their mostly low-wage jobs, many former recipients earn less than they collected in welfare checks along with food stamps, health care and subsidized housing.
Meanwhile, better-off Americans who might help are spending and borrowing more than ever and reaching record levels of bankruptcy and debt, so they have less to save and to give. "One would have expected that at a certain level of prosperity, people might reach a certain limit of their consumption," said Julian Wolpert, a professor at the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton who specializes in tracking philanthropy. "But we're not getting that."
In some ways, the nation has never looked so bountiful. William H. Gates 3rd, the chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, and his wife, Melinda, have created a foundation that dwarfs even those of the Rockefellers and Fords, and by the end of this year, Harvard University will have amassed more than $2.3 billion in a single capital fund drive. Giving USA, which monitors philanthropic giving, reports a prosperity-driven surge in giving to a record $175 billion last year, up nearly 11 percent from 1997.
But about 90 percent of the money goes to religious organizations, some of which operate services for the poor, and to other organizations that cater mostly to the rich and the middle class like the opera, ballet, museums and universities. "They add nicely to our quality of life," Mr. Wolpert said of these organizations, "but they are also the kinds of things that we ourselves use."
No one keeps track of contributions to programs the poor use. But Giving USA reports that contributions for human services, including most forms of traditional charity and some that are not, represented 9.2 percent of all giving last year, a decline from 13.9 percent in 1970.
And by a variety of measures, people are also giving less to all forms of philanthropy. The Independent Sector, a coalition of philanthropic organizations, says households donated 2.1 percent of their incomes last year, compared with 2.5 percent a decade ago, and that the number of those making any contributions fell to 70.1 percent last year from 75.1 percent in 1989. After inflation, the organization reports, a family's average gift to human service organizations fell to $250 last year from $271 four years ago.
Animals get more sympathy than children, said Joyce Strom, president and chief executive of the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children in Boston. "If there's an animal abused," she said, "people will flock to the cause and raise money on the spot."
Ms. Strom's organization, which serves 100,000 children a year, must struggle with curbs in government support of its services and the costs and difficulties of raising money from the public.
State payments for the society's services to children amount to $24 million of its annual budget of $30 million. While salaries and other costs rise, the state has frozen the payments of support, some for as long as 12 years. "So in going after private donations, Ms. Strom said, "I have to raise money just to fill the hole I'm in, and it's really, really tough to raise money."
As a result, Ms. Strom said, "We have to turn people away all the time. People who are reported for child abuse and neglect but who are screened out because their cases are not serious enough."
Some analysts are unsympathetic with the travails of low-budget agencies that serve the poor. "It's their mission to complain," said Paul G. Schervish, director of Boston College's Social Welfare Research Institute, who sees the nation entering a golden age of philanthropy, with the baby-boom generation leaving tens of trillions of dollars to their estates and charities.
"What's happening is these groups are facing competition," Mr. Schervish said. "It doesn't mean people are giving any less." Part of their contributions to organizations like Harvard and Boston College is used to educate the poor, he said.
Michael Petit, a director of the Child Welfare League of America and former commissioner for human services for the state of Maine, said: "There is a large gap between what these families require to be whole and what is available to them. The early, front-end investment in children is not occurring at a sufficient scale to make a difference."
Such charities' accounts of the gap in their resources and needs vary only in the details. At the United Way, said Tony De Cristofaro, a spokesman, "over the last 10 years, we have had increases virtually every year in contributions." But he said the share that donors designate for health and humans "is flat at best or declining."
Other charities describe similar gaps in needs and resources. The Capital Area Food Bank dispatches almost two million tons of food a month to 780 food pantries and church kitchens that feed 200,000 people a month.
"In 1988, we were seeing one out of five children" in the Washington area, said Linda Brantley, the food bank's president and chief executive. "Then five years down the road, it was one out of four. Now we are seeing one out of three."
Julie Platek, vice president for fund development for Associated Catholic Charities of Houston, has noticed that supporters now give for buildings and endowments more readily than for services.
The organization just completed a successful drive for $11 million, mostly for a new central program building. But raising money for emergency services -- disaster relief, food, shelter and clothing -- is much harder. In part because of the change in the welfare system, "we had a 40 percent increase in the numbers of people served through emergency assistance from 1996 to 1998," Ms. Platek said.
Philanthropic contributions by corporations, typically about one percent of their profits and about five percent of all giving nationally, have been declining more than those from individuals, many charities report. This has put a strain on the National Urban League in New York, whose affiliates provide education and job training to minority clients.
With mergers and plant closings, said Milton Little, executive vice president and chief operating officer, "this has been an extremely difficult year for us."
Charity executives say it is hard to determine why Americans do not share more of their prosperity with the poor. They speculate that in moving to gated communities in the suburbs, people who rally to help hurricane victims seen on television do not see the need around the corner. Herman Ewing, president of the Urban League of Memphis, said prosperity, for all its appeal, can undermine the sharing and the bonds of neighbors and communities and gives people a lot to protect.
"The result of prosperity is isolation, arrogance and in-your-face," Mr. Ewing said. "This among people who were once interdependent in terms of basic survival needs. The idea that you're looking out for me for food and I'm looking out for you for this or that is all by the boards."
Gail Ober, executive director of the Children's Aid Society of Pennsylvania, said: "I'm concerned that we are not a kinder society. Child welfare agencies serve the most at-risk families. I'm not sure there's a value attached to having some responsibility for those families."
Elizabeth Boris, director of the Center on Nonprofits and Philanthropy at the Urban Institute, said, "We're not as generous as we could be." But it may be because many of the newly rich have not turned their attention to charity. "This may be a lag," Ms. Boris said. "Maybe the whole generation of folks making money are not yet a part of the network of people who give."

HEADLINE: Homeless in America: A Statistical Profile

 BODY:
No one knows precisely how many Americans are homeless. But with homelessness reemerging as a political issue, federal officials released a report last week that is a comprehensive analysis of homeless people served by shelters, soup kitchens and other programs. The snapshot by the Department of Housing and Urban Development was based on surveys and interviews in 1995 and 1996 of adults who used these services. Officials estimated that 470,000 were sheltered on an average night in February 1996, which was about one quarter of those who were homeless at any time during the year.

Two's a Challenge, But Seven's a Crowd

BYLINE: By B. Drummond Ayres Jr. 

 BODY:
For months, the morning line on next year's Senate race in Pennsylvania has been that the Republican incumbent, Rick Santorum, should be one of the easiest targets for Democrats in their battle to recapture the Senate. He is a conservative in a state that typically elects moderates, his 1994 margin of victory was a flimsy two points and he has since struggled to raise his poll numbers. 
 In fact, Democrats think Mr. Santorum is so vulnerable that no fewer than seven -- so far -- are competing for the right to take him on.
And that's turning out to be a problem.
For Democrats.
Last weekend, when the Democratic State Committee gathered in Harrisburg, six of the contenders showed up to work the corridors and caucuses in search of support. That struck many committee members as perhaps too much of a good thing and they have since begun to push the thought that perhaps it would be better, politically, if some candidates dropped out, lest the party end up badly battering itself in a divisive, money-devouring primary next spring.
Not one of the seven contenders is widely known throughout the state, and some face serious campaign money problems. The one with the best chance to be nominated and go on to beat Senator Santorum, many Democratic leaders think, is Representative Ron Klink, who hails from the Pittsburgh area.
The most visible of the other candidates, all from the Philadelphia area, are Tom Foley, a former state labor commissioner, Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky and Peter Kostmayer, former members of Congress, and Allyson Y. Schwartz, a state senator.
As Mr. Klink's supporters see it, in a nomination fight he would have his base area in western Pennsylvania mostly to himself whereas his main competitors would be scrapping for -- and splintering -- the vote in their base area in eastern Pennsylvania.
As the fall contest nominee, the Klink supporters go on, Mr. Klink, who tends to vote liberal on economic issues and conservative on social issues, would be ideally positioned not only to go for the state's big centrist vote but also to steal some of Senator Santorum's conservative base.
An analyst, Charles E. Cook Jr., wrote recently in the Cook Political Report that if that reasoning was correct, then "the question is, who is running second and third in the primary field and how long will it take before the field becomes more manageable?"
"Santorum is vulnerable," Mr. Cook said. "But Democrats have a long way to go before they can take advantage of that vulnerability."

HEADLINE: At Bush's Ear, A Supply-SiderWith a Heart

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
LAWRENCE B. LINDSEY, the former Federal Reserve governor who is now George W. Bush's chief economic adviser, sees himself as a mere technician, helping to turn the presidential candidate's vision into nuts-and-bolts programs.
"Governor Bush has a very clear idea of where he wants to take the country," Mr. Lindsey said the other evening, winding down after a hectic week of helping him make his first big economic policy speech of the campaign. "We're there to provide suggestions on the best way to accomplish the policy." 
 Mr. Lindsey, an affable, 45-year-old Harvard-trained economist who worked in the White House during both the Reagan and Bush administrations, has been around politics long enough to know when to defer to the boss.
But Mr. Lindsey clearly has substantial influence in honing the campaign's message and putting flesh on the Texas governor's "compassionate conservatism" theme. Equally important, he provides policy gravitas to a candidate who constantly confronts whispers that he is a lightweight.
In the year and a half since they first met and began discussing economic policy, Mr. Lindsey has covered a lot of ground with Mr. Bush, from international finance and trade to Social Security and the Federal Reserve. But on no subject has he had a more direct influence than on tax cuts, the centerpiece of any Republican platform. While by all accounts the $483 billion tax-cutting proposal that Mr. Bush unveiled this month was shaped by the candidate's own philosophy, its details and presentation carried Mr. Lindsey's stamp.
Mr. Lindsey, for example, does not see a clear case for reducing the tax rate on long-term capital gains below the current 20 percent, at least not at the expense of reducing marginal income tax rates, but he is much keener on eliminating the inheritance tax on large estates. The Bush plan bucked supply-side orthodoxy by skipping a capital-gains tax cut, but it included a phaseout of the estate tax.
And while a strong believer in lower income tax rates, Mr. Lindsey is not a fan of the single-rate flat tax advocated by other Republicans including Steve Forbes, whose candidacy is dogging Mr. Bush from the right. Mr. Bush's plan keeps the progressive income tax system intact.
Mr. Lindsey has warned for several years that the economy may soon turn downward, and Mr. Bush presented his tax plan in part as insurance against a recession.
"It's very clear when you look at the Bush tax plan that it has Larry Lindsey's fingerprints all over it," said Stephen Moore, director of fiscal policy studies at the Cato Institute, a conservative research group.
With elections often turning on pocketbook issues, an economic plan is as much a part of a presidential campaign as the stump speech or the fund-raiser. And as the presidential race moves toward the first primaries, economists and other policy experts are building economic platforms for each of the candidates, motivated variously by principle and ideology, the lure of power and the media spotlight, and the promise of a big job if the outcome is right.
ON the Democratic side, Vice President Al Gore, eager to distance himself from Washington and President Clinton on many issues, is making a conspicuous exception for the administration's economic record. He is relying more for advice and policy prescriptions on insiders like Gene Sperling, the White House economic policy adviser, than on the outside economists in his camp, like Alan Blinder, the Princeton economist and former Fed vice chairman.
Bill Bradley, the former New Jersey senator whose campaign cultivates an image of plain-speaking insurgency and who keeps his own counsel on most policy matters, announced last week that he had two establishment heavyweights in his camp: Paul Volcker, the former Fed chairman, and Henry Kaufman, the Wall Street economist.
Among the Republican candidates, Mr. Forbes has a whole stable of supply-side economists, headed by Lawrence Kudlow, a former Reagan administration economist now with Wertheim Schroder, an investment firm. Senator John McCain of Arizona has no formal economic team but relies on an informal network of contacts from his two decades in Washington and his chairmanship of the Commerce Committee.
But needing to educate himself about a host of complex topics -- and eager to tweak traditional Republican thinking on some economic policy issues -- Mr. Bush has assembled a larger and more prominent roster of economic advisers than any of his rivals. In addition to Mr. Lindsey, the 10-member team includes Michael J. Boskin, who was chief White House economist under President Bush and is now at Stanford University's Hoover Institution; Martin S. Feldstein, the Harvard economist who is head of the National Bureau of Economic Research; John F. Cogan, who was a budget aide to President Reagan; and John B. Taylor, an expert on monetary policy. Mr. Cogan and Mr. Taylor are also at Stanford.
Developing Mr. Bush's proposals is a role that in some ways seems tailor-made for Mr. Lindsey -- and enlisting him is good politics for Mr. Bush. Mr. Lindsey made his name in Washington during the 1980's with an academic defense of tax cuts as a spur to economic growth. That endeared him to the Republican Party's supply-side wing, a group that felt betrayed by President Bush and harbors suspicions about Governor Bush's commitment to reducing taxes.
Yet even as he has advocated conservative orthodoxy on reducing marginal income tax rates, Mr. Lindsey has challenged it by urging his party to do more to fight poverty and to provide low-income people with better access to housing. At the Federal Reserve, where officials often seem cloistered in their offices, Mr. Lindsey was known for trooping through subsidized housing projects and warning bankers to make sure that race and barriers to obtaining credit did not discourage homeownership. "You could see in Larry's approach some of the precursors to compassionate conservatism, whatever that means," said Mr. Blinder, who served at the Fed with Mr. Lindsey.
To a presidential candidate trying to woo his party's conservative base while seeking to redefine its ideology to appeal to moderates, Mr. Lindsey's credentials as a supply-sider with a heart fit perfectly. "They were simpatico from the get-go," said Al Hubbard, a longtime friend of Mr. Bush who worked with Mr. Lindsey at the White House and introduced the two last year.
Yet in other ways, Mr. Lindsey is an odd choice as a top aide to any presidential candidate, especially the congenitally upbeat Mr. Bush. Mr. Lindsey is renowned for his bearish views on the stock market and his consistent predictions that the strong economy is on the verge of a painful downturn, positions that raise questions about his skills as a forecaster.
Eighteen months ago, when the Dow Jones industrial average was at 8,500, he said publicly that stock prices were overvalued and that he had sold all his equity holdings so he could sleep better at night. The Dow closed on Friday at 11,224.70.
And with the current business expansion just months from becoming the longest in the nation's history, Mr. Lindsey warned recently that a downturn in the business cycle was near.
Under the glare of media attention as the campaign has heated up, Mr. Lindsey has moderated his views -- but just a bit.
"I have a lot of faith about the long-term strength of the economy and in the positive changes that have happened over the last 20 years in reducing taxes and regulation," Mr. Lindsey said. "But I don't think we've repealed the business cycle, and I think that financial markets are probably more optimistic than they should be about the course of the business cycle from here on out."
In many ways, Mr. Lindsey has always been outspoken, at least by Washington standards. Four years ago, while still at the Fed and making $123,000 a year, Mr. Lindsey was turned down for a charge card by Toys "R" Us. Eager to make a point about the fallibility of credit reports, Mr. Lindsey went public with his experience.
It turned out that his credit report showed many inquiries about his financial history, in part because he was refinancing a loan at the time. The inquiries raised a red flag, which Toys "R" Us and the bank issuing its credit cards did not check further.
The episode had a happy ending. Mr. Lindsey said that nearly all big credit card issuers came to him at the Fed to say they would adopt a new approach: People rejected for credit by a software program would get a second look by a human being to see if there were mitigating circumstances.
"The problem I had was that we're increasingly using computers to make consumer credit decisions and taking human decision-making out of the process," Mr. Lindsey said.
BORN in Peekskill, N.Y., the son of public school teachers, Mr. Lindsey grew up intending to become a lawyer, and with far more liberal views than he holds now. While at Bowdoin College in Maine, he got early exposure to supply and demand by starting a hot-dog stand, and exposure to politics as a volunteer for George McGovern, the 1972 Democratic presidential nominee. As his interest in policy grew, he moved decidedly to the right.
"The lesson we learned from the Great Society and the 1970's is that those objectives of a better life for everyone are fine, but big government is not going to be the one to provide it," he said. "The question we have is what can we conservatives do, we who believe in the power of the individual and the market, to solve the problems that liberalism has failed to solve."
Part of Mr. Lindsey's answer is on display in Mr. Bush's tax plan. Acting on Mr. Bush's order that the proposal address the ways in which high marginal tax rates hurt taxpayers at all income levels, Mr. Lindsey and the rest of the economic team spent months debating not just how much to reduce rates for the wealthy and the upper middle class, but also how to aid the working poor.
People earning $20,000 to $25,000 a year can face some of the highest marginal tax rates in the system. At those income levels, many people begin losing the benefits of the earned income tax credit, which helps people whose incomes are below or just above the poverty line. Seeing that quirk as a barrier to entry to the middle class, Mr. Lindsey and his colleagues settled on a plan that reduces the lowest rate to 10 percent and doubles the per-child credit to $1,000.
"One of the strengths of the Bush plan -- which has many weaknesses -- is its effort to reduce the high marginal tax rates paid by the working poor," Mr. Blinder said. "Among supply-side conservatives there is typically remarkably little concern with the plight of the poor in general and with the very high marginal tax rates paid by the poor."
Having spent nearly all of his professional career in Washington, including five years as a Fed governor ending in early 1997, Mr. Lindsey said he originally intended to remain neutral during the Republican primaries, in part because he had ties to a number of candidates, including Lamar Alexander and Dan Quayle. Then Mr. Hubbard introduced him to Mr. Bush. After traveling to Austin for three long sessions with the governor last year, Mr. Lindsey jumped when Mr. Bush asked him to join his team.
"Having the right president is important, and I think I found the right guy," Mr. Lindsey said. "He's a natural leader. He's got good instincts. He absorbs things quickly and he's comfortable with himself."
Mr. Lindsey helped pull together the other members of the team, many of whom worked in the White House during the 1980's and have strongly held positions of their own. He has helped to brief Mr. Bush on a variety of subjects and to prepare him for debates. And he is working with the rest of the team on detailed proposals for topics like overhauling Social Security and improving access to health care.
The group met irregularly for much of the last year, starting even before Mr. Bush announced he would run. The members have gathered in Austin, in Washington and once at Mr. Boskin's home in California; they hold regular conference calls. Technically the group is managed by Mr. Hubbard, not Mr. Lindsey, so that Mr. Lindsey is free to advocate positions, rather than play the role of honest broker among competing views. And there have been some disagreements. As the tax plan was completed, for example, the 10 members were evenly divided over whether the top income tax rate should be reduced to 30 percent or 33 percent from 39.6 percent. Mr. Bush ultimately decided on 33 percent.
"It's a very collegial group that's worked well together," Mr. Hubbard said. "That doesn't mean there haven't been disagreements, but for the most part they haven't been about what's best for the economy. They've been about what works best on the political side, and ultimately that's the governor's call."
WITH the tax plan out of the way, Mr. Lindsey -- who is working for the campaign as a volunteer -- is again spending more time at what he calls his day jobs. Those are a chair at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research group, where he is working on a book about housing, and his consulting firm, Economic Strategies Inc., whose clients are financial institutions and large corporations in the United States, Asia and Europe.
He seems likely, though, to be back in the thick of politics in coming months if Mr. Bush goes ahead with an approach, backed by Mr. Lindsey, to use much of the projected federal budget surplus to finance a partial privatization of Social Security. And should Mr. Bush be elected president, Mr. Lindsey and his colleagues on the economic team would no doubt have plum jobs available to them -- from Treasury secretary on down.
"We haven't talked about it and we shouldn't," Mr. Lindsey said of post-election daydreams. "My wife and I have said, 'Let's do this through the election and see what happens.' But by all means I'd like to have only one job after the election."

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about Lawrence B. Lindsey, chief economic adviser in the presidential campaign of George W. Bush, referred incorrectly to a disagreement among members of Mr. Bush's economic team in recommending a reduction in the top federal income tax rate. The team was divided between two main options for reducing the rate -- to 30 percent or 35 percent, not 30 or 33; in his plan, Mr. Bush decided on 33.

HEADLINE: Panama Trouble: Who Hands Canal Over?

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 11

 BODY:
At the beginning of the century, President Theodore Roosevelt not only drove home the importance of the Panama Canal to America's becoming a great power, he also felt so strongly about it that he drove a steam shovel that helped dig the engineering marvel of his age.
Now, as the century ends, another president, Bill Clinton, is having trouble finding a United States official to give it away, a problem that more than anything reflects how the canal has receded in importance -- militarily, economically and, above all, politically. 
 Even as the administration describes the moment of the handover as a signal one in relations with Latin America, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said she would not go, apparently because she preferred to be in Washington for Middle East peace talks. The American delegation will instead be led by Jimmy Carter, who was president in 1978 when the Senate decided, with only one vote to spare, to approve the treaties giving away the canal, which cost the United States $352 million and 5,609 lives to build.
The Panamanians had hoped that the handover ceremony would be more prestigious. President Mireya Moscoso came to Washington in October to ask Mr. Clinton to go this Tuesday to the Miraflores Locks for the ceremony that will symbolically transfer power over the canal. Mr. Clinton was noncommittal.
The State Department recommended that the president go. The National Security Council sent him a memorandum that described the ceremonies but did not say whether he should attend. Officials there would not say what was the recommendation of the president's national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger.
"I know he wanted to go," Thomas F. McLarty 3rd, formerly the president's top Latin American adviser, said on Friday. "I think he felt it was a historic occasion."
Mr. Clinton has never told the Panamanians or the American public why he has decided not to attend. White House aides have offered a variety of explanations, from the need to work on the budget, to the difficulty of laying on yet another foreign trip, to his desire to let Mr. Carter take the leading role -- an explanation suggesting a Clinton affection for Mr. Carter previously unknown.
Aside from Dr. Albright, with whom Mr. Berger argued over her decision to stay away, another obvious fill-in for Mr. Clinton is Vice President Al Gore. But, in a presidential campaign in which Mr. Gore clearly wants to take no chances at all, he never volunteered, knowing that among the costs of the approval of the canal treaties in 1978 and 1980 were the seats of about a dozen Democratic senators. Nor did the White House, his staff insisted, ever ask him to go.
By the weekend, the White House was still scrambling to fill the delegation. While Rodney Slater, secretary of transportation, and William Daley, secretary of commerce, were included in the delegation, the State Department said its highest-ranking official would be Peter Romero, the acting assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs.
But if the administration was having trouble stirring up much enthusiasm for the handover, critics were also failing to stir up much outrage over what at this stage is a done deal.
That was not always the case. In 1976, while President Gerald R. Ford was negotiating a pact, he was challenged in the Republican primaries by Ronald Reagan, who made the canal issue a rallying cry, saying: "We built it. We paid for it. It's ours and we're going to keep it."
Another California Republican, Senator S. I. Hayakawa, displayed a sense of the history of American involvement in Panama's secession from Colombia when he said, "we stole it fair and square."
The fight in the Senate in 1978 was bitter, and today's arguments are pallid in comparison. Senator Trent Lott, the Republican leader from Mississippi, and Representative Dana Rohrabacher, a California Republican, have been complaining that Hutchison-Whampoa, a company based in Hong Kong, has contracts for container ports at both ends of the canal -- an implication that the canal could become a foothold for Chinese meddling, or worse, in the Western Hemisphere.
Mr. Lott has called its presence "a critical national security issue." Mr. Rohrabacher said the problem was even worse: "Mainland Chinese criminal Triad gangs -- some of whom have ties to Chinese intelligence agencies -- are active throughout Panama, in partnership with the Russian mafia, the Cuban intelligence service and South American cartels in conducting drug and weapons smuggling."
Robert Pastor, a professor of political science at Emory University who worked on the treaties under President Carter, scoffed at such complaints, saying Hutchison-Whampoa runs large port operations around the world
But Mr. Pastor also criticized Mr. Clinton, saying the president's absence from the handover ceremony was a mistake.
This was the moment, he said, to define American leadership for the 21st century, for "the transformation of the 20th century is symbolized by the evolution of our role in Panama, from insisting on a quasi-colonial presence to defend the canal at the beginning of the century to recognizing that the best way to defend the canal in the new century is by a partnership with Panama."

THE END OF
 NORTH KOREA
 By Nicholas Eberstadt.
 191 pp. Washington:
 The AEI Press.
 Cloth, $29.95. Paper, $14.95. 
 The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is a bizarre and frightening new kind of political life form: it is less a nation-state than a shakedown state. Unable to feed its people, incapable of directing the economy to make anything that can be sold on world markets and unwilling to risk reforms that might weaken its grip on power, the country's ruling clique subsists on the earnings from a calculated policy of extortion. By threatening to build and test nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, the North Korean government has succeeded in extracting substantial quantities of assistance from the international community, in particular from the United States, Japan and the genuinely democratic Republic of Korea to the south. North Korea exports terror and imports foreign aid. In his careful, incisive and important new book, "The End of North Korea," Nicholas Eberstadt, a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, explains how this unwholesome exchange began and makes the case for bringing it to a close.
The splitting of the Korean peninsula, like the division of Germany, was a product of the early cold war. From its inception in 1948, the Soviet-backed government in Pyongyang proclaimed its highest goal to be the reunification of all Korea under Communist rule. When it failed to achieve its aims by invading South Korea in 1950, it embarked on a huge arms buildup and waited for another opportunity to strike. The moment never came.
By the late 1970's, South Korea was beginning to boom. Meanwhile, the North Korean economy was staggering under the combined burdens of a bloated military budget and a grossly inefficient system of central government planning. Since the fall of its Soviet patron, North Korea has been locked in a death spiral of declining production, shriveling trade and deepening famine. (By some estimates, as many as two million to three million of its 22 million people may have starved to death in recent years.) Only outside assistance, obtained through threats to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and periodic launchings of increasingly long-range ballistic missiles, has staved off a total, terminal collapse.
The governments of the countries keeping North Korea on life support see little alternative to continuing to do so. Some have even convinced themselves that if they can only coax North Korea into greater economic openness, they will be able to pave the way for a genuine reconciliation between North and South. Eberstadt makes quick work of such fantasies. All schemes for expanded commercial contact and peaceful political change turn on the assumption that Pyongyang can somehow be persuaded to loosen up. But North Korea's dictator, Kim Jong Il, who insists on the title "Dear Leader," has repeatedly made clear that he regards even the slightest act of relaxation as tantamount to suicide.
Eberstadt argues persuasively that prolonging North Korea's life may actually increase the costs and the dangers of its inevitable demise. With every passing day, the developmental gap between the two Koreas grows, and with it the difficulty of merging them into a single, prosperous society. Given time, North Korea will also be able to build more and better terror weapons.
What is to be done? On this question Eberstadt is disappointingly vague. Apart from urging policy makers to abandon their current obsession with short-term stability, he does not have many concrete suggestions. Cutting North Korea off from all outside assistance might hasten its fall, but it would also risk triggering war or desperate acts of large-scale terrorism. Until they have convinced themselves that they can deal with these dangers, the United States and its friends will probably continue to pay the Dear Leader the tribute he demands, while hoping that somehow, someday, he will simply go away.

Since the fall of its Soviet patron, North Korea has been locked in a death spiral of declining production, shriveling trade and deepening famine. (By some estimates, as many as two million to three million of its 22 million people may have starved to death in recent years.) Only outside assistance, obtained through threats to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and periodic launchings of increasingly long-range ballistic missiles, has staved off a total, terminal collapse.
The governments of the countries keeping North Korea on life support see little alternative to continuing to do so. Some have even convinced themselves that if they can only coax North Korea into greater economic openness, they will be able to pave the way for a genuine reconciliation between North and South. Eberstadt makes quick work of such fantasies. All schemes for expanded commercial contact and peaceful political change turn on the assumption that Pyongyang can somehow be persuaded to loosen up. But North Korea's dictator, Kim Jong Il, who insists on the title "Dear Leader," has repeatedly made clear that he regards even the slightest act of relaxation as tantamount to suicide.
Eberstadt argues persuasively that prolonging North Korea's life may actually increase the costs and the dangers of its inevitable demise. With every passing day, the developmental gap between the two Koreas grows, and with it the difficulty of merging them into a single, prosperous society. Given time, North Korea will also be able to build more and better terror weapons.
What is to be done? On this question Eberstadt is disappointingly vague. Apart from urging policy makers to abandon their current obsession with short-term stability, he does not have many concrete suggestions. Cutting North Korea off from all outside assistance might hasten its fall, but it would also risk triggering war or desperate acts of large-scale terrorism. Until they have convinced themselves that they can deal with these dangers, the United States and its friends will probably continue to pay the Dear Leader the tribute he demands, while hoping that somehow, someday, he will simply go away.

HEADLINE: Pataki's Health Plan

 BODY:

To the Editor:
It is disappointing that Gov. George E. Pataki proposes to make health coverage affordable only to the unemployed (news article, Dec. 9). Surely Mr. Pataki doesn't want New Yorkers to give up their jobs to get health coverage when three of four of the 2.4 million uninsured adults in New York are working. 
 While Mr. Pataki says he is concerned that employers will drop coverage if the state helps pay, he overlooks the fact that the uninsured are working for employers who don't provide coverage now. Many other states have expanded coverage to the uninsured. New York has made health coverage affordable to children in working families; uninsured adults deserve the same.

HEADLINE: Caught in a U.S. Civil War

BYLINE: By Norbert Walter; Norbert Walter is chief economist for Deutsche Bank.

DATELINE: FRANKFURT

 BODY:
In the eyes of most outsiders, the United States, with its dynamic companies and strong lead in high technology, is the prime beneficiary of globalization. And yet, in the wake of the disastrous World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle, it is effectively presenting itself as one of globalization's most aggrieved victims.
No wonder, then, that many abroad see the United States as a nation divided against itself. It dominates the world economy with its strong economic performance, but at the same time feels deeply insecure about participating in the global economic system. 
 In my view, this confusing attitude is to a large extent due to one phenomenon: Quite a few Americans are currently determined to make globalization the catch-all phrase for issues that primarily warrant debate within the United States: American wage inequality and the accessibility of American workers to benefits.
American labor unions and their allies opposing globalization argue that free trade is costing American workers their well-paying manufacturing jobs with generous benefits, and thus contributes to growing wage inequality. But the entire set of worker issues has much deeper roots than globalization.
To prove this, you just have to look to Europe. While we have our fair share of problems to deal with, sharp income disparities are not among them, despite globalization. Moreover the same corporations often give their employees higher wages and better benefits in Europe than in the United States.
The American political system has chosen great flexibility in the labor market and comparatively little government intervention in the economy. These choices work well for many Americans but leave others behind. And all of the issues they raise have been around since long before globalization dominated the scene.
That is why people outside the United States worry now that, for many Americans, the rest of the world simply provides a convenient stage on which to carry out an internal debate. The W.T.O. -- with its power over the entire world economy -- is not the right forum for dealing with what essentially are domestic American problems. Wage inequality in the United States will hardly be resolved by imposing labor standards on developing countries and enforcing them with sanctions, as President Clinton has suggested.
Observers who are not part of the internal American debate should be forgiven for their irritation at being dragged into this family quarrel. Viewed from abroad, the rather unexpected American attack on the global trading system appears particularly strange. The current system and its institutions -- like the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the W.T.O. -- were created largely by American design.
Now that most countries around the world are, at least to some degree, embracing the American-inspired free-market model that drives them, it is bewildering to see significant forces inside the United States trying to distance themselves from it.
Of course, the root of the conflict is in domestic American politics. Some analysts have begun to compare the trade policy of the United States to its conduct of the Kosovo conflict, with losses to be avoided at almost any cost. This leads to a surreal negotiating strategy: unless American politicians can ensure that globalization makes every last American a complete victor and satisfies every American concern, it is an unacceptable proposition for the United States.
This is disconcerting.
Historically, most successful trading regimes have relied on at least one country that is strong enough -- and, above all, willing -- to enforce the rules and, if needed, make some concessions to keep the process moving. In the 50 years since the end of World War II, the United States has done a tremendous job of filling this role.
Americans will be quick to point out that others, especially the Europeans and the Japanese, must share the burdens of economic leadership. But political realists also have to consider that Europe and Japan are in the midst of the painful transformation that the United States economy underwent in the late 1980's and early 1990's.
The United States economy is strong and continues to grow. The United States has it in its power not to shun its global responsibilities. At a minimum, other countries, facing their own adjustment costs from continued change in the world trading system, will not agree to the American demand that no American be disadvantaged by global trade.

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY;
Local Signals May Be Costly For Satellite TV Providers

BYLINE: By SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
Talk about putting your money where your lobbyists' mouths are.
For years, the nation's big satellite television companies, DirecTV and EchoStar Communications, have wailed and railed in Washington for the right to include local broadcasters in their services. Two weeks ago, they finally got it. 
 Now comes the really hard work.
Between them, DirecTV, with about eight million subscribers, and EchoStar, with about three million, may have to spend as much as $1 billion to deliver local stations, including local affiliates of the four big broadcast networks, to dozens of markets nationwide.
Even so, not every satellite subscriber will get local stations; there may not be enough satellite capacity -- or economic motive -- to rebroadcast hundreds of local television stations and there probably never will be. And in the case of EchoStar, even in areas where the local service will be offered, many of its customers will require new, slightly larger satellite dishes to pick up the rebroadcast local signals.
But such are the tradeoffs in the confluence of technology, politics and finance that has characterized the development of the satellite television business.
Until two weeks ago, the satellite operators were forbidden by law to transmit local channels -- including ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC affiliates -- to most customers. The rationale for the restriction was that the national satellite services might harm local broadcasters by, say, beaming a New York City station into Des Moines.
But for years, the satellite companies howled that the local restriction hurt them and consumers by keeping satellite television from providing full competition to local cable television monopolies.
"We realized a while ago that it was, in our opinion, very important if we were going to be effective competitors to cable that we have the ability to offer local programming on fair terms," said David K. Moskowitz, the EchoStar senior vice president who oversees the company's local broadcasting initiative.
So when President Clinton signed the Satellite Television Home Viewers Act, which lifted the restriction, on Nov. 29 as part of a spending bill, the satellite companies largely hailed the development as opening the final door to competition with the cable monopolies.
"This is a big fix," said Eddy W. Hartenstein, president of DirecTV, which is part of General Motors' Hughes Electronics subsidiary. "The last remaining barrier why people haven't gotten the service is they say, 'Can I get my local channels?' "
But for the satellite companies, the potentially lucrative opportunities of carrying local broadcast signals will come at considerable cost. DirecTV and EchoStar have already begun transmitting local signals to big markets, including New York and Los Angeles, and want to expand their offerings to dozens more markets by the end of the year. But as the carriers roll out their local offerings across the nation, the capacity of their existing satellites will be sorely tested.
Moreover, the Federal Communications Commission has yet to write the rules for implementing the new law. A big open question is how many local stations within a market the satellite company will be obliged to carry. While both DirecTV and EchoStar say they want to offer the four major commercial broadcast network affiliates, they argue that they should not be compelled to rebroadcast the dozen or more less-watched stations in some big metropolitan areas.
For both consumers and the satellite carriers themselves, the wrinkles in offering local stations are largely a product of how satellites are deployed and managed.
Some 22,300 miles above the equator, there are three orbital slots authorized for direct-broadcast satellites. At that altitude, a satellite positioned at 101, 110 or 119 degrees west longitude can serve all 48 contiguous states.
At each of the three direct-broadcast satellite slots, there are 32 available frequencies. And on each frequency, current video compression technology allows the satellite companies to transmit up to 10 standard television channels.
By the legacies and luck of F.C.C. licensing, DirecTV controls all 32 frequencies at the 101-degree slot, an additional 3 at 110 degrees and another 11 at 119 degrees. EchoStar, meanwhile, controls no frequencies at 101 degrees, 29 at 110 and 21 at 119.
That means EchoStar, with 50 frequency slots, has more total capacity than does DirecTV, with 46 frequency slots. The big catch, however, is that standard satellite dish antennas can receive signals from only one slot at a time. Almost all DirecTV subscribers have their dishes pointed at the 101-degree position, where DirecTV controls all 32 frequencies Almost all EchoStar subscribers aim at the 119-degree slot, where EchoStar has 21 frequencies.
The difference has major implications for the ways the companies will introduce local programming and for the steps users will or will not have to take to view it.
Because DirecTV controls all 32 frequencies at the 101-degree slot, most DirecTV subscribers can theoretically receive up to 320 channels. DirecTV, however, now generally offers its customers a maximum of about 225 channels.
DirecTV intends to use the unused channel capacity at 101 degrees to beam down local broadcast signals. By the end of next month, it plans to use its available channels to offer the four major local broadcast affiliates to each of 20 to 25 markets, or about half of the nation's TV households.
But it is an inefficient process, since everyDirecTV dish antenna in the country will be catching signals of all of those 80 to 100 local affiliates. By scrambling and selectively unscrambling the signals, DirecTV will enable subscribers in any one local market to view only the local broadcasters from their home market.
And yet, DirecTV subscribers in those 20 to 25 markets will not need to recalibrate their dishes or buy new ones. That is why DirecTV appears excited about the prospects of convincing its existing customers to pay an additional $5.99 a month to receive local programming as part of their satellite service. If even 20 percent of DirecTV's existing eight million customers sign up, that means about $115 million in additional annual revenue for the company.
EchoStar, however, finds itself in a somewhat more difficult position. Since almost all EchoStar subscribers' dishes point to 119 degrees, where EchoStar controls only 21 frequencies, EchoStar will not be able to deliver many, if any, new local channels to subscribers using their existing dishes.
And so, EchoStar intends to beam local channels mostly from satellites in the 110 degree slot, which EchoStar obtained rights to only last summer in a deal with the News Corporation and MCI Worldcom. Receiving those signals, however, will require most EchoStar customers to either add a second dish or replace their existing dishes with a new model that can capture signals from two orbital slots at once.
That is why EchoStar does not talk so much about offering local channels to existing customers but is promoting the new local services to attract new customers.
"Most of our existing customers have found ways to satisfy themselves without the network channels from our service," Mr. Moskowitz said. "But there is an enormous population that has not yet pulled the plug on cable because of the absence of local on satellite. And that's what's so neat about this; it gives new customers that reason."
Whatever their competitive positions now, though, both DirecTV and EchoStar face the same regulatory uncertainty as the F.C.C. writes the rules to put the new satellite television law into effect.
The problem for the satellite companies is that they want to offer only the four big-network affiliates -- and maybe a few other popular stations -- in each local market. But the F.C.C. is expected to rule that entering a given market obligates carriers to retransmit every broadcast station in that market.
Cable television systems are under a similar obligation, which is known as the must-carry rule and which is meant to prevent smaller stations from discrimination.
The satellite companies say the requirement, which is expected to take force in 2002, will require them to offer local service in fewer markets than they might otherwise because it will quickly consume too much of their satellites' channel capacity.
"Must-carry is a terrible thing, and I just don't understand the logic of it," said Mr. Moskowitz, the EchoStar executive.
Last week, DirecTV announced that it would buy and launch a new satellite to help meet its must-carry obligations. Unlike the company's traditional satellites, which beam signals to the entire nation, the company's new so-called spot-beam satellite is expected to make more efficient use of the companies' frequencies, allowing them to be reused in different markets for rebroadcasting local television channels.
With communications satellites generally costing $250 million each, EchoStar and its chairman, Charles W. Ergen, have not yet committed to launching a new spot-beam satellite.
Even without launching additional satellites, the companies could end up spending hundreds of millions of dollars on the various other on-the-ground systems that will be required to transmit local channels to dozens of markets, analysts said.
But in the satellite industry's continuing battle against cable television, local stations may be the final weapon, one too valuable to turn down.
"We're in a growth business," Mr. Hartenstein said. "We're creating value from a business perspective, and we're creating a great alternative to cable, especially with this last local offering."

Chart: "The Challenge of Providing Local Television by Satellites"
For DirecTV, a new law that lets satellite television companies rebroadcast the signals of local television stations is a costly opportunity. The diagrams below, greatly simplified, show DirecTV's near-term and long-term approaches to providing local broadcast coverage in some of the nation's largest metropolitan areas.
 
THE NEXT TWO YEARS
 
HOW IT WORKS -- DirecTV's existing fleet of satellites is capable of transmitting about 320 channels, using beams that cover the entire nation. To provide local-broadcast coverage, channels intended for only one local market are scrambled so that customers elsewhere cannot view them. Using this technique to deliver four local-broadcast channels in each of 25 markets will consume 100 of the satellite system's television channels.
ADVANTAGES -- The company can use existing satellites to offer four local channels in some areas immediately and expects to reach about 25 major markets by the end of January.
DISADVANTAGES -- Inefficient. It will limit DirecTV's ability to offer other types of programming, and households outside the largest markets will not get local rebroadcast service.
 
BEGINNING 2002
 
HOW IT WILL WORK -- A new satellite that DirecTV plans to put in service by 2002 will be designed to break up beams into spots aimed at selected metropolitan areas. This will allow different channels to be sent to each area.
ADVANTAGES -- Much more efficient. The company will be able to offer more channels in each market and expand the service to smaller markets. It will also free the national channels, allowing for many more programming options from DirecTV's other, full-beam satellites.
DISADVANTAGES -- The company will have to spend about $200 million to build, launch and operate the spot-beam satellite. And households in most rural areas will still not be included in the local rebroadcast service. (Source: DirecTV)(pg. C4)

HEADLINE: World Trade Group Picking Up the Pieces From Seattle

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON 

DATELINE: GENEVA, Dec. 12

 BODY:
Struggling to recover from the trade conference in Seattle that collapsed in failure nine days ago, the World Trade Organization plans a special meeting this Friday to decide how to proceed.
A spokesman for the 135-nation group that makes the rules for international commerce said that the main purpose of the meeting of its general council would be to regain momentum for resolving some disputes that had foiled the ministerial conference in Seattle, leaving delegates dispirited and angry. 
 The conference had been intended as a forum for delegates to agree on an agenda for lowering some of the remaining barriers to freer world trade, through negotiations to take place during the next few years.
Thousands of protesters disrupted the conference in scenes reminiscent of late 1960's mass action against American involvement in the Vietnam War. They denounced the W.T.O. as a secretive, probusiness group that ignores environmental protection and labor rights in the name of corporate profits.
Protesters blocked access to the conference sites on the first day and some rampaged through downtown Seattle; more than 500 were arrested by riot police officers, who have been accused of responding with violent tactics of their own.
The conference ended after delegates could not even agree on whether to discuss issues that have divided them, most notably agricultural subsidies and labor rights in developing countries.
In the week since W.T.O. delegates have returned to their Geneva headquarters, many remain shocked by the events in Seattle. Some staff members at the ordinarily quiet building that houses the organization say they have been barraged by hate mail and virus-laced e-mail.
"There is certainly a feeling of disappointment," said Tunisia's envoy, Kamel Morjane, in a comment typical of the negotiators who have returned.
While most envoys refrained from finger-pointing in public, there was no hesitance to do so in Brussels, where the European Union trade commissioner, Pascal Lamy, attributed the breakdown in Seattle to American presidential-campaign politics, and said he doubted that a new round of negotiations could get under way until after the election next November.
The W.T.O.'s director general, Mike Moore, sounding a rare hopeful note, said he wanted to get going with efforts to open a new round of trade talks. "The longer we delay launching the negotiations," he said, "the more the poorest among us lose."
Others have expressed pessimism whether the organization can even decide what should happen next.
"There is a confusion here," said Mexico's envoy, Alejandro de la Pena. "It is not at all clear how we are going to follow up.
"But we all know this is not the end. It's not like this is the first time we have found ourselves in a situation like this," he said, alluding to the suspension of negotiations during the previous Uruguay trade round in 1988 and 1990.

Concern Over Year 2000Remains Low in Surveys

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

 BODY:
With the days winding down until the year 2000, each new survey or poll seems to add to the evidence that Americans are confident computer glitches will not have much impact on their lives.
The National Federation of Independent Businesses, the leading trade association for small companies, reported recently that many members who had said last spring that they would take steps to prepare for computer problems this fall had now decided not to bother. And a survey for the National Association of Manufacturers found that 93 percent of members expected the year 2000 to have almost no impact on their companies and only 4 percent foresaw significant disruptions of any part of the economy. 
 "What's news in this survey is what we're not seeing," said Jerry Jasinowski, the manufacturing group's president, in announcing the results last Friday. "There's no last-minute panic and little stockpiling of inventory."
The manufacturers' sample was small -- just 100 out of its 14,000 members -- but the economist who did the survey, Edward Yardeni of Deutsche Bank, said the results were in line with answers to the same questions by a much larger group of similar companies about two weeks earlier. (The data from these surveys, and previous samplings, is at www.peoplepolls.com). The levels of concern rise only when certain sectors, like health care, are isolated, Mr. Yardeni said.
The air of normalcy is being reinforced by surveys that are actually thinly disguised advertising. Blockbuster Video recently reported that more than 22 percent of those it polled planned to celebrate the arrival of the Year 2000 by renting a movie and staying home. London International Group, maker of Durex condoms, reported that among 16- to 21-year-olds worldwide, nearly half intend -- or at least hope -- that the big night would include activities requiring its products.
It all adds up to a challenging climate for many Year 2000 entrepreneurs, particularly those who anticipated that disruptions and public concern would be in full swing by now.
Consider the book world. "The Millennium Bug" by Michael S. Hyatt, probably the best seller so far among Year 2000 books, is hanging strong, relatively speaking, in the No. 820 spot on Amazon's hardcover sales list. But "Time Bomb 2000" the onetime hot-seller by Edward Yourdon, a well-known software expert, and his daughter, Jennifer, was down to No. 12,322 over all in the rankings. And "Crisis Investing for the Year 2000" by L. Jay Kuo and Edward M. Dua, was 86,808th.
Meanwhile, Jan Nickerson, who claims to have created the only Year 2000 board game, has just started a two-for-one sale ($34 including shipping at www. Y2KConnections.com).
Those trying to sell their wares are increasingly competing with others who make many of the same points more succinctly for free. The Utne Reader recently began offering free copies of its Y2K Citizen's Action Guide to any group that wants at least 50 or more (contact mitra@utne.com). "Awakening: the Upside of Y2K," a collection of essays on community and personal preparedness edited by Judy Laddon, Larry Shook and Tom Atlee, costs $7 at Amazon.com; but Ms. Laddon will give 50 or more copies for free to anyone who pays shipping costs (JGLaddon@aol.com).
And last week, Global Action Plan, a nonprofit environmental group in Woodstock, N.Y., announced plans to distribute 125,000 preparedness brochures to community groups in 16 states, all financed by the Nathan Cummings Foundation. (The brochure can be downloaded free at www.GlobalActionPlan.org).

RCN Planning to Acquire Small Local Phone Carrier
Expanding its communications footprint from the East Coast to the Midwest, RCN has agreed to acquire the 21st Century Telecom Group, a small local communications carrier based in Chicago, for about $260 million in stock, executives close to the talks said. The deal is expected to be announced today.
 RCN, based in Princeton, N.J., and so far operating mainly in the corridor between Boston and Washington, is the biggest company competing against the regional Bell companies for residential customers. Page C8.
 
Polls Show Little Year 2000 Concern
With the days winding down until the new year, each new survey or poll seems to add to the evidence that Americans are confident Year 2000 computer glitches will not have much effect on their lives. The results add up to a challenging climate for many entrepreneurs, particularly those who expected that disruptions and public concern would be in full swing. C10. 

A Century of Powerful Advertising
Madison Avenue did not assume its familiar form until this century -- when mass-produced, name-brand products began to be promoted through mass media. So in the spirit of summing up a century, it only makes sense to designate the 100 most powerful corporate and product brands of the 20th century, which must include McDonald's, and predict which brands will be powerful in the 21st century.

Web Helps Lift Newspaper Stocks
The stocks of newspaper companies jumped last week as the industry's numbers seemed to please both those who cared about cyclical trends and those enamored of Internet highfliers. Company by company, executives reported at a media conference that the cyclical business was thriving. And they also said that revenues from their Internet properties were growing exponentially.

Book of Millionaire Final Answers
Since Walt Disney's Hyperion moved in last month with its corporate cousin, ABC, the television network and the publisher have become extremely cozy. Hyperion just hit the lottery with a $10.95 official handbook to ABC's popular quiz show "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire." The show's writers helped to develop the book, which has answers to perilous question, and the game's host, Regis Philbin, did his share by holding up the handbook during one of the shows. C17.

HEADLINE: Telecommunications Powerhouse;
Goldman Sachs Rules as Industry Is Transformed in Europe

BYLINE: By LAURA M. HOLSON with ANDREW ROSS SORKIN 

 BODY:
For a brief period last month, it seemed that the Goldman Sachs Group might become a victim of its own international success.
Mannesmann, the German telecommunications giant, had filed a conflict-of-interest suit in London, arguing that Goldman should be barred from advising the British wireless company Vodafone AirTouch. On what grounds? Because Goldman had advised an investor in Orange of Britain, a wireless company Mannesmann itself wanted. 
 But the court called the suit hopeless, refusing to censure Goldman for having too many of a good thing -- clients. In the end, the episode underscored what investment bankers had known all along: Goldman Sachs had become a dominant force in the redrawing of Europe's telecommunications map.
Chalk it up to the appetites of acquisition-hungry Europeans eager to expand their network empires -- and to Goldman's years of positioning itself to direct and underwrite that action.
This year, Goldman has been an adviser on $239 billion of telecommunications mergers in Europe. That represents an almost fourfold increase over 1998, according to Thompson Financial Securities Data, and enough to propel it from No. 11 to No. 1 on the list of bankers in European telecommunications mergers. Not only is Goldman the lead adviser for the voracious Vodafone, Britain's largest wireless concern, but it acts as counsel to other giants, most notably Deutsche Telekom, which Goldman took public in 1996.
This rise to prominence has come at the expense of European investment bankers like Lazard Freres & Company and Schroders, Britain's largest independent investment bank. They have not only fallen behind Goldman on their own turf but know that its most formidable opponent in the region is another American firm, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Company.
But the European bankers face more than bad luck. In a year when American-style corporate takeovers are overrunning the traditions of economic nationalism in Europe -- a few years ago, a hostile bid by a British company for a German telecommunications company would have been unthinkable -- the contestants need the American banks that know best how to play the game.
"They've outmuscled all of us because of their single-minded focus on winning," an investment banker at a European firm said of Goldman. To illustrate his point, he began humming the theme song from "The A Team," a 1980's television show about a group of rebels who brandished weapons to defeat their enemies. "Goldman's like the A Team. They're a real shoot-'em-up group."
Goldman began its march into Europe more than a decade ago when, anticipating a wave of privatization in telecommunications, the firm began calling on government agencies to help them sell stakes in state-owned telephone concerns. Scott Mead, a Cambridge-educated American, was one of the core team to set up shop in 1988 in London, where he is now co-head of Goldman's global communications, media and entertainment group. His counterpart is another American, Robert S. Harrison, a longtime Goldman partner who teamed up with Mr. Mead early this year and is based in New York.
One of the group's first deals was a public offering by Telefonica S.A., Spain's biggest telecommunications company, in the late 80's. Other stock underwriting assignments followed, including one by Britain's Cable and Wireless in 1989 and another by TeleDanmark of Denmark in 1994.
But Goldman's big break came when it was picked by the German government to sell a $13 billion stake in Deutsche Telekom in a stock offering in 1996. The assignment became the cornerstone of Goldman's campaign to court top-tier European telecommunications players. "It was the franchising of our German office," Mr. Mead said. "People could see the German government had faith in us and this was a good thing."
Wooing Deutsche Telekom required a protracted courtship. Goldman bankers from both London and Frankfurt had approached the German company in 1990 about the prospects of a sale. They held regular strategy sessions with executives along with several smaller meetings, Mr. Mead recalled. Top executives from New York made regular visits and in 1994, a Goldman associate began working from an office in Deutsche Telekom headquarters.
Its established relationships with European telephone companies helped Goldman to pounce as new businesses like wireless communications and Internet access have spun out of the telephone industry.
"The Goldman strategy is if it was owned by the government, take it private," said Howard Anderson, chairman of the Yankee Group, a telecommunications research firm. "If it is private, take it public. Then merge it. They are a transaction machine."
Consider the case of Spain's Terra Networks S.A., a provider of Internet access and content in Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking countries, which Goldman took public last month and whose market value reached $13.9 billion as of last Friday. Terra Networks is a unit of Goldman's oldest European telecom client, Telefonica.
Goldman's European base has also enabled the firm to enhance client relationships in the United States. In 1998, for instance, Goldman advised the Ameritech Corporation, the Chicago-based telephone company, on its purchase of a 34.4 percent stake in another Goldman client, Denmark's state-owned TeleDanmark, for $3.1 billion. That deal led to Goldman's advising Ameritech on its sale earlier this year to SBC Communications Inc., Mr. Mead said.
This year, however, if any company has put Goldman on the map in Europe it has been Vodafone AirTouch. Few people in the United States had even heard of the company until last January, when it defeated Bell Atlantic in a bidding contest to buy AirTouch Communications, one of the largest American cellular phone companies, for $77 billion. And then, as if to show there were no hard feelings, Vodafone followed up in the summer with the announcement of an $80 billion cellular joint venture -- with Bell Atlantic.
Vodafone executives knew Goldman as far back as 1988, when the firm helped with the spinoff of Vodafone from Racal Electronics, a military-electronics company. In the early going, Goldman did not conduct much business for Vodafone because the telecommunications company was not actively pursuing deals, said Christopher Gent, Vodafone's chief executive. In fact, Goldman nearly lost the account altogether when it played lead banker for the 1996 initial stock offering of a Vodafone competitor, Orange, without conferring with Vodafone.
To make amends, Mr. Gent said, Goldman's chief executive at the time, Jon S. Corzine, called him personally to apologize. "We came to an understanding early on of what was expected of them," Mr. Gent recalled. "I expected them to commit to us."
It was not long before Mr. Mead began to call on Mr. Gent personally.
The two men hit it off, and Mr. Gent recalls a strategy meeting in 1997 where they came up with the notion that telecommunications companies like Vodafone would either "hunt or be hunted." To survive in a global market, Mr. Gent said, "we had to do it by transactions, not by being stealth."
Goldman leaped into action, dispatching teams from both Europe and the United States to begin working up a strategy with Vodafone, resulting in the AirTouch and Bell Atlantic forays and the ongoing effort to take control of Mannesmann.
But even Mr. Gent is mindful of the risk Goldman has taken by choosing to represent his company in the Mannesmann battle. Germany is one of its most lucrative markets, and if the strategy backfires, the Goldman name will surely lose some luster there. "It was a huge decision for them to back us in Germany because they are so strong there," Mr. Gent said. "It could hurt them. I'm sure there was a lot of discussion at Goldman about this."
Last January, Mr. Harrison, a longtime Goldman partner and friend of Mr. Mead's since their university days in Britain in the late 1970's, joined him at Mr. Mead's invitation to co-head the communications, media and entertainment group. Through the spring, over several dinners in Manhattan at Provence in SoHo and other French bistros, and through frequent trips between New York and London, the two mapped out their group's strategy for adapting to a fast-changing telecommunications world.
First, the Mr. Mead and Mr. Harrison decided that Goldman's 175 telecommunications bankers worldwide should focus on two types of concerns: "super league" telecommunications companies, of which they say there are some 60 worldwide, including the likes of Vodafone and Deutsche Telekom; as well as emerging telecom companies. "We are looking for the next Global Crossing, huge users of capital that require high-yield financing," Mr. Harrison said, alluding to an upstart telecommunications company that Goldman and others have advised, which is investing in undersea cables for Internet use. "Right now it is a question of finding them."
And it is a question of whether Goldman can service them. Goldman has always been strong in merger advice and taking companies public. But high-yield finance -- debt financing with sufficient risk that investors demand a higher interest rate -- has never been Goldman's forte. Hoping to change that, Goldman recently hired David Solomon, a noted Wall Street rainmaker and former co-head of investment banking at Bear, Stearns, to help lead its newly expanded global high-yield banking business.
Steve Galbraith, an investment banking and brokerage analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, is one of many in the industry who are closely watching Goldman's high-yield effort. "It is the only part of their arsenal they are missing," Mr. Galbraith said. "It will be interesting to see if this strategy works out."
And in a nod to the colliding worlds of technology, telecommunications and media, Goldman's global communication group has set up a joint venture with its technology team to represent Internet companies and telecommunications equipment makers. It is not unusual for technology and telecommunications bankers to cross paths, but until now they have typically called on clients separately in order to protect lucrative fiefs.
If Goldman's approach is successful, other investment banks might be tempted to follow suit. If not, Goldman may find its bankers divided by turf battles that could leave the firm vulnerable to competitors all too happy to swoop in and steal business.
"Their vision is: fortune favors the bold," Mr. Anderson, the Yankee Group chairman, said of Goldman's success in Europe. "We'll see how well they apply it to their own business in the coming years."

HEADLINE: Experts Say NASA Is on Course, Despite Setbacks

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD 

 BODY:
Lean, mean and ready to do things differently, Daniel S. Goldin came to the office of NASA administrator seven years ago as a crusader eager to shake up an agency adrift in failure and mediocrity. His mantra was "faster, cheaper, better."
No more behemoths that cost many billions of dollars apiece would be built to explore outer space. Instead, he vowed to tap American ingenuity to build swarms of small but powerful spacecraft that would probe the heavens, sending back a nearly constant stream of new information. Today, about $100 billion later, the revolution that Mr. Goldin engineered is in a crisis. It has suffered its worst blows yet with the loss in recent months of a pair of Mars craft -- an orbiter and a lander with two innovative surface probes the size of cantaloupes. 
 Still, there is surprising agreement among NASA officials and leaders in space exploration that despite its troubles, the agency is on course.
Mr. Goldin, 59, the longest continuously serving head of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, is zealous, even as he appoints panels to investigate the current problems. He says he is chastened by failure but unbowed in his tenets.
"We got set back," he said of the Mars failures. "But we'll pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and we're going to rock this world. The revolution continues."
He said his initiatives have not only produced dozens of successes in space exploration -- discovering new worlds and probing many others, from the Moon to the galactic maternity wards where stars are born -- but also saved taxpayers at least $40 billion.
A half-dozen space leaders seemed to echo Mr. Goldin's judgment.
In interviews, they said his revolution is basically sound, if shaken. Plans for the Mars program, shattered by disaster, are in flux. But no expert foresaw big changes in the principles of "faster, cheaper, better," nor a need for more than relatively minor adjustments in what some call Captain Dan's star trek.
Some analysts said the voyage is just beginning to pick up speed and big economies and advances lie ahead.
"We fell into cutting too many corners," said John C. Beckman, head of the systems division at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, which designed the recently lost spacecraft. "But the basic process is not broken. There's still a lot to be gained from increasing our efficiency. I really do believe that we've barely scratched the surface in terms of what's possible."
Claude R. Canizares, chairman of the space studies board at the National Academy of Sciences and director of the Center for Space Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, agreed, saying that on balance the revolution's troubles were worth the benefits.
"It's possible that the pendulum has swung too far," he said. "But you can argue that, given the realities of human nature, this was bound to happen and it's not wholly a bad thing. It helps you define the limits. Hopefully we can learn from that in terms of best practices, rather than learning as in a tribunal."
John M. Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, was the most critical, saying penny pinching had pushed many teams to the breaking point.
"There's a balance between science return, acceptance of risk and cost reduction," he said. "Those have gotten out of balance, with too much emphasis on cost reduction. But the idea of doing missions more rapidly and at lower cost certainly is still valid. The issue is how rapidly and how much cost reduction."
The general upbeat appraisal for "faster, cheaper, better" is all the more remarkable given a rash of failures that began in 1997 and reached a crescendo in past weeks:.
*Two Earth-observing craft, Lewis and Clark, failed in orbit in 1997 and production in 1998, victims of instrument problems, testing delays, rising costs and control-system flaws.
*In December 1998, the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous spacecraft missed its meeting with Eros, a potato-shaped rock 25 miles long. It is to try again next year.
*The telescope on the Wide-Field Infrared Explorer satellite lost its protective cover shortly after launching last March, letting coolant escape into space and ruining the astronomy mission.
*In September, a mix-up between English and metric units in navigation data sent the Mars Climate Orbiter off course and probably plummeting into Mars in fiery death.
*This month, the Mars Polar Lander, a traditional probe with retrorockets as well as two small hitchhikers meant to smash into the planet at 400 miles per hour and survive to send back data, fell silent as it neared touchdown.
After the latest failures, NASA promised a "major rethinking" of the strategy for the Mars program, which could include a two-year delay in the next landing effort, planned for launching in 2001.
Despite the ominous cast of recent events, more than one analyst noted that there had been many more successes than failures. Winners include spacecraft that have studied the Moon, the Sun, an asteroid, the Earth's magnetosphere, interstellar clouds, interplanetary dust and distant stars and new kinds of engines for advanced spacecraft.
The Mars Pathfinder mission in 1997 became a global sensation as its plucky little robot, Sojourner, rolled across the Martian soil, analyzing rocks and sending back stunning photographs.
Howard E. McCurdy, a space historian at American University who is working on a book about the Goldin revolution, noted that the total cost of 16 small missions was about the same as the Cassini spacecraft, a $3.3 billion colossus of the old school now on its way to Saturn.
"That's why it's so attractive," he said of the revolution. "You can do 16 missions for price of one."
"Yeah," he added, "you lose maybe 20 percent but you're still ahead."
The NASA program that is hard to shrink dramatically for safety reasons, he said, is that of human spaceflight, including the nation's fleet of space shuttles and the international space station taking shape in orbit.
Their costs, Dr. McCurdy said, dwarf those of the satellites and probes and account for roughly half the NASA budget, which this year is $13.6 billion.
Joseph A. Burns, a planetary scientist at Cornell University, said the Goldin revolution had considerable merit but was failing to come to grips with future big-ticket exploratory goals that were hard to do fast and cheap. Examples he cited were "a serious search" for life on Mars and a major voyage to the outer solar system, where icy planets and comets hold clues of creation.
"A lot of people would still like to do that," he said of a trek to the dark fringes of the Sun's realm.
Mr. Goldin said his agenda was expanding, not contracting, and that by design it could continue to embrace risk and failure.
If NASA has 10 winners out of 10 tries, he said, "we have mediocre goals." Conversely, he added, if two or three ambitious tries fail while seven or eight succeed, that "would be unbelievable success."
Revolution is difficult but rewarding, he said. Most important, "it goes on."

Since 1992, NASA has embraced the mantra faster, cheaper, better, meaning it would launch more missions at lower costs but higher risks. As a point of contrast, the Cassini spacecraft, launched in 1997, cost $3.3 billion.

HEADLINE: Candidates Go to Florida, Eyes on the Primary Prize

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO with KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: ORLANDO, Fla., Dec. 12

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore and former Senator Bill Bradley, the Democratic candidates for president, opened a spirited competition for Florida voters this weekend, delivering dueling speeches before the state Democratic convention that, in gentlemanly language, sharply contrasted their records, styles and visions for the country.
In a forceful speech before 2,000 party stalwarts today, Mr. Bradley suggested that the vice president would "shrink back" and "tinker around the edges," while his own "bold" ideas would rekindle the spirit of three Democratic icons: Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Robert F. Kennedy. 
 "I say, 'Now is not the time to settle,' " Mr. Bradley said, testing a new refrain in his 35-minute address. "I'm not prepared to settle for anything less than making access to health care affordable to all Americans. I'm not prepared to settle for anything short of registering and licensing all handguns in this country. I'm not prepared to settle for anything less than bringing all children out of poverty in this country."
"Democrats," he concluded, "do not settle."
On Saturday, Mr. Gore delivered a 45-minute speech in which he toned down his usual sledgehammer attacks on Mr. Bradley, apparently out of respect for the health of the former senator, who had gone to a California hospital on Friday suffering from a bout of irregular heart beats.
But without naming his opponent, Mr. Gore suggested to his audience that Mr. Bradley's positions on Social Security, education, the budget and Medicare, the government health care program for the elderly, were out of sync with traditional Democratic values.
"I voted against those Reagan-Bush budget cuts," Mr. Gore said, omitting his usual criticism of Mr. Bradley for supporting them in 1981. "I fought against the Newt Gingrich Republican Congress," he added, invoking questions about Mr. Bradley's party loyalty for retiring from the Senate in 1996 after Mr. Gingrich became speaker of the House.
In another implicit jab at Mr. Bradley, Mr. Gore said, "I have never been afraid to take on the big pharmaceutical companies," a reference to Mr. Bradley's repeated Senate votes for measures supported by the pharmaceutical industry. New Jersey, the state Mr. Bradley represented in the Senate, is home to many of the nation's largest drug companies, several of which contributed heavily to Mr. Bradley's Senate campaigns.
Mr. Bradley's irregular heart beats, atrial fibrillation, a chronic condition for which he takes daily medication, forced him to cancel several West Coast events on Friday and Saturday. But his doctors, who say the condition is not serious, said the palpitations stopped spontaneously on Friday, without treatment.
Mr. Bradley looked relaxed and energetic today. His aides said he would maintain a busy campaign schedule this week.
The appearance of the two candidates in Florida, the fourth-largest state, underscored the potential importance of its primary, which falls on March 14, one week after the primaries in California, New York, Ohio and several other states. Both men will have to campaign selectively in March, and this weekend's convention indicated that they will focus on Florida.
For the Gore camp, Florida, along with other Southern states, offers an important opportunity to knock Mr. Bradley back if he does well on March 7. The vice president, who is from Tennessee, is viewed as the front-runner here and across the South. He has locked up endorsements from Attorney General Bob Butterworth and other top Democratic officials in Florida, and from the state's largest unions, including its 442,000-member A.F.L.-C.I.O.
But officials of the Bradley campaign say they can compete with Mr. Gore in Florida more effectively than in other Southern states, largely because of its many transplanted New York and New Jersey residents. In addition to representing New Jersey in the Senate for 18 years, Mr. Bradley played basketball for the New York Knicks for 10 years.
In wooing Florida voters now, the two candidates also reflect a growing concern among many Democrats that the eventual Democratic nominee may have trouble winning here next November because Florida's Governor, Jeb Bush, is the brother of the Republican front-runner, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
President Clinton won the state in 1996, but several polls have shown George W. Bush leading both Democrats here.
"Their coming here sends a signal that Florida is still viable for the Democrats," said Charles Whitehead, the chairman of the state Democratic Party.
Mr. Whitehead said he thought Mr. Bradley faced "an uphill battle" in Florida. But he said he thought the former senator was gaining support, adding: "I would guess that 75 percent of Bradley's supporters in the room today were committed to Gore before the convention. He was very well received today."
Mr. Gore's chief message here was to Florida's legions of retired people, reassuring them that he would stand fast on protecting Social Security and Medicare, programs he has said Mr. Bradley would do little to defend and might even undermine.
Mr. Gore also traded unabashedly on his partnership with President Clinton, who remains popular in Florida and who spoke warmly of Mr. Gore to the conventioneers earlier on Saturday. Mr. Gore reminded the audience of the economic boom of the Clinton years and of Florida's support for the re-election of the Clinton-Gore ticket in 1996.
"Bill Clinton and I came in and, with Democratic votes alone, we changed the policy of our country, and we reordered the priorities," Mr. Gore said. "This kind of progress is not something that we should just casually toss aside."
Mr. Bradley gave his usual stump speech today, but spiced it with a stronger assertion than usual of his support for Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare and civil rights protections.
"Is there anybody who questions our belief in Social Security, civil rights, Medicare?" he asked. "That's why I find it so dismaying that one Democrat can attack another on these issues. On issues that are articles of faith for our party. If we are united on anything, we have to be united on these issues."
Both candidates made strong appeals to black voters, voicing their support for affirmative action, which has become a hot topic here. Opponents of the policy are trying to place an initiative on the ballot that would end the use of racial preferences by the state government and public universities.
Both candidates said they supported giving a visa to the father of Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old Cuban boy who was rescued off the Florida coast while escaping to the United States aboard a boat last month. The boy's mother died on the trip, and he has become the focus of a battle between his father, who says he wants him returned to Cuba, and Cuban-Americans in Florida who want him to remain here.

HEADLINE: 10-Year-Old Jetliner Remains a Work in Progress

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: INDIANAPOLIS

 BODY:
Sitting on huge steel jacks in a maintenance hangar here, the big, gray Boeing 737, tail No. N-1383, was in for some serious work.
A floor beam under the aft galley was rusting; the steel tracks that guide the wing flaps were wearing out, and engineers suspected that the cargo doors were developing hidden cracks. The plane's maintenance report over the past month formed a computer printout about 15 feet long, and the Federal Aviation Administration had demanded that United Airlines, the plane's operator, install a better flight data recorder and a firefighting system in the cargo holds, among other changes, in response to airplane crashes. In all, the plane needed about 50 changes, plus extensive routine maintenance. 
 The situation seemed to prove the adage that a plane is a collection of spare parts flying in close formation. But Frederick L. Mohr, managing director of United Airlines' maintenance center here, called N-1383 a "pretty good airplane."
Passenger jets like N-1383 usually get close public scrutiny only after fatal accidents. At that point, every broken part they ever flew with, every flaw that was waiting to be corrected, every malady that any plane of that type ever experienced, takes on an ominous aura.
But the everyday reality for planes like N-1383, which is based at United's San Francisco hub and makes short flights around California, is far different. With hundreds of thousands of parts, multiple redundant systems, elaborate monitoring systems and a strict maintenance regimen, the plane is almost always available, able to safely carry 126 passengers in coach and 8 in first class and even safely sustain a variety of part failures in flight.
The plane almost always needs work, however. Today was "Day 3 of 19," as described by Robert K. Corriveau, the team leader for the hangar section where 215 mechanics were stripping pieces off the plane, reminiscent of insects on the carcass of a giant bird.
In its 10-year lifetime, in 30,166 hours of flight, the plane has never had an engine fail or have to be shut down in flight, and if it is average among United's fleet -- the airline's engines are more reliable than most others -- it will not have that problem for years to come. In 20,080 flights, it has never had to return to an airport or divert on the way to a destination because of a mechanical problem.
The airline has had to report to the Federal Aviation Administration about problems involving N-1383 on three occasions, all relatively minor incidents involving lights that were not working correctly. One involved floor lighting for emergency escapes, another the light on an emergency exit slide, and the third an indicator light that flickered instead of correctly showing whether the plane's wing slats were retracted in flight. The pilot had to look out of a window of the passenger cabin to see that the slats were functioning properly.
But the history of airline crashes is, in a way, carved into the hardware of this airplane. For example in May 1996, a ValuJet DC-9 took off with improperly packed hazardous cargo that caught fire, causing the plane to crash. On this visit, N-1383 was having smoke detectors and fire suppression systems installed in its forward and aft cargo holds.
The inspection itself is partly a result of the roof peeling away in flight on an Aloha Airlines 737 in April 1988. (The plane landed safely.) Some of the flaws found are not easily detected. A worker examined the floor beam, for example, with a mirror only a little bigger than the one a dentist might use.
Other changes come from other crashes.
In September 1994, a USAir 737 crashed near Pittsburgh, and solving the mystery of the cause took more than three years, partly because its flight data recorder had been an early model; on this visit, N-1383 was getting an updated version.
The new flight data recorder is a good example of the difference between minimum requirements and what United considers good maintenance. The original flight data recorder captured 16 categories of information; the F.A.A., after much debate, is requiring 22, but the one United is installing will capture 36.
The aircraft is also getting a computer, the "enhanced ground proximity warning system," that compares the plane's course to an electronic map and warns against flying too low.
That is a result of the 1995 crash of an American Airlines plane in Columbia. And the plane is getting a new weather radar that can detect windshear, the sudden shift from a headwind to a tailwind.
Forty of the 50 changes in the maintenance visit are voluntary, most of them recommended by Boeing, with others the idea of United.
From a bolt on a landing gear that tends to crack because of corrosion, causing delays, to unreliable seals on a refrigerator in the galley, the list of changes goes on and on.
But these are only the changes made in heavy maintenance. The service report over the last month is a secession of burned-out light bulbs or other small problems. The plane has six wheels, and has had four tire replacements in the last month. One tire was replaced twice.
Over and over, maintenance officials say that safety is their top priority. But it was clear that many of the changes would be reliability problems long before they would be safety problems.
The engineering staff evaluates a constant flow of service problems from the field, and "service bulletins" from Boeing recommending changes as well as the manufacturers of the engines and other components. On a plane like the 737, the service bulletins can reach 1,000 a year. Airlines like United will take action on most of the recommendations. The aviation agency will focus on a handful and make them mandatory.
United's aim is to complete action on the suggestions in the safety-related bulletins long before the agency mandates them, which can take years. Sometimes this backfires.
For example, after the National Transportation Safety Board said that the USAir crash in Pittsburgh showed a problem with the hydraulic unit in the rudder, United replaced the unit in its 737's before the agency finished drafting its rule to require the change. In the end, though, the agency mandated one test more than United had accomplished, and the airline had to take the hydraulic units off the plane a second time and put them to the additional test. "We went out and tried to lead the industry, but then they came out with another test," said Gregory Borsari, United's manager of engineering for 737's.
Each change leads to a raft of other changes. Anything that adds five pounds or more to the plane's weight goes into a database used to recalculate its center of gravity, for example. (And planes, like people, tend to get heavier as they age.) And any new system, like the fire detection and suppression system, means a new maintenance schedule.
For N-1383, which United bought new from Boeing in March 1990, this was heavy maintenance visit No. 2, the second time it has been torn apart and rebuilt. The process will include 20,148 hours of mechanics' labor, including 3,000 for modifications ordered by the aviation agency, recommended by Boeing or simply desired by United's 200 engineers, at a total labor cost of $420,000. Materials will cost another $342,000.
That is relatively cheap. By heavy maintenance visit No. 7, when the plane will be more than 30 years old, N-1383 will require 38,000 hours of labor, and the visit will cost about $3 million, not counting modifications that have not yet been devised.
The escalating cost of heavy maintenance may be what determines how long the plane can economically be flown, said Mr. Mohr, the United official. After that it will be scrapped or sold to a third-world airline "that doesn't have the same standards."

HEADLINE: Iowa Pivotal for Forbes's Battle to Counter Bush

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

DATELINE: DES MOINES

 BODY:
In a convention hall filled with farm families from every corner of Iowa, Steve Forbes recently came face to face with George W. Bush and was treated to a vision of his coming task in Iowa's caucuses next month.
Wherever Mr. Bush went, cameras and flashes heralded his way, and teenage girls squealed with delight to be near him. A sea of John Deere-green baseball hats labeled "Bush Farm Team" bobbed on farmers' heads as they surged forward for autographs and a closer look at Mr. Bush, the governor of Texas and the front-runner in the race for the Republican presidential nomination. 
 In another corner at the Farm Bureau's annual meeting was Mr. Forbes, the multimillionaire magazine publisher, with only a meager crowd around him as he earnestly extolled the money-saving virtues of his flat tax plan.
At one point, when Kara Holtkamp of West Point, Iowa, put one of the Bush hats in Mr. Forbes's hands for an autograph, he gamely quipped: "Bush will let you wear the green. I'll let you keep the green."
Even though Mr. Bush's long shadow falls over the Forbes campaign here, it is in Iowa, Forbes campaign strategists say, that they feel they have the best chance of halting Mr. Bush's march toward his party's nomination, and establishing Mr. Forbes as a viable alternative.
To that end, the Forbes campaign is making Iowa its top priority. Veteran political strategists, with years of experience in local politics, are on Mr. Forbes's payroll. Television advertisements that cost about $60,000 a week are filling the Iowa airwaves. Grass-roots organizations have been set up in every county and most of the state's precincts, complete with county farm chairmen, anti-abortion captains and an assortment of other volunteer leaders to round up Forbes supporters.
Sophisticated direct mail and phone bank campaigns are under way, stressing how Mr. Forbes's tax program will help farmers. And the candidate himself has been hopping from one crossroads town to another in a campaign bus that blares John Philip Sousa marches, and wooing local voters with a first-class offering of food and drink.
The Forbes campaign here sees itself as part of a one-two punch to halt the front-runner: Mr. Forbes solidly challenging Mr. Bush in Iowa and Senator John McCain of Arizona closing in on Mr. Bush in New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primaries, to be held on Feb. 1, one week after the Iowa caucuses.
While no one -- even those in the Forbes camp -- expects Mr. Forbes to win in Iowa, they are hoping to keep Mr. Bush's lead here as slim as possible. Mr. McCain has avoided Iowa and is concentrating on New Hampshire, where he and Mr. Bush are neck and neck in the polls and Mr. Forbes remains a distant third.
"McCain is banking on us in Iowa to hold Bush down," said William Dal Col, the Forbes campaign manager. "And we're banking on him in New Hampshire."
John Maxwell, the campaign's top pollster, said: "Our Iowa strategy is to show Forbes as a viable candidate and pierce the veneer of inevitability of Bush. No one has ever gotten the Republican nomination doing poorly both in Iowa and New Hampshire. We're posing a serious threat to Bush in Iowa and McCain is in New Hampshire. Bush cannot take a double hit."
Forbes strategists are banking that their candidate's conservative economic message -- reducing taxes and shrinking the government -- will resonate with Iowa Republicans. But they are also hoping to score big with a socially conservative message of family values and opposition to abortion, much as Pat Robertson, the religious broadcaster, did when he placed second in the caucuses in 1988, behind then-Senator Bob Dole of neighboring Kansas, and as Patrick J. Buchanan did when he finished a strong second in 1996, behind Mr. Dole.
"Forbes is trying to emerge as a religious conservative alternative to Bush," said Dennis Goldford, head of the department of politics at Drake University. "In the Republican caucuses, something like 40 percent of the voters can be social conservatives, and Forbes has decided to bend that way. He has no illusion he could beat Bush. But if he could soften him in Iowa and McCain can deliver a punch, then people might start looking for someone else."
To this end, the Forbes campaign has put the former head of the Iowa Christian Coalition, Stephen Scheffler, on its Iowa payroll, and Mr. Scheffler has lined up an array of Iowa anti-abortion leaders telling social conservatives that Mr. Forbes is a more viable candidate than Gary L. Bauer, who is also seeking votes from religious conservatives.
Audiotapes of Mr. Forbes's anti-abortion speech at the National Christian Coalition convention are being sent to social conservatives, along with a number of position papers and a brochure called the "Baby Mailer" by local staff members because of the photograph on the cover of this anti-abortion pamphlet.
"I'm convinced Forbes is a guy who can go the long haul, has a message that is consistent and he's a winnable candidate," said Mr. Scheffler. "Social conservatives are convinced that he is for real and won't get squishy with his pro-family agenda when he gets elected."
In spending, organization and advertising, Mr. Forbes is going toe to toe with Mr. Bush, just as he did in last August's Iowa straw poll, when Mr. Forbes and Mr. Bush spent from $800,000 to $1 million each. Mr. Bush came in first, with 31 percent of the nonbinding vote, and Mr. Forbes finished second with 20 percent. The Forbes campaign would not say how much Mr. Forbes, who is dipping into his $440 million fortune to pay for his candidacy, has budgeted for the Iowa caucuses.
Unlike in a typical election that is settled at the ballot box, victory in the Iowa caucuses often comes to the candidate with the superior organization -- one that can deliver supporters to 2,142 local precincts for several hours of political debate with their neighbors on a cold night in January.
"You've got to go out and get real people," said Mr. Dal Col, the Forbes campaign manager. "You've got to grab them and get them to go out on a night that can be 20 to 30 degrees below zero, have them fight for their candidates and then take a vote."
Steve Grubbs, a Forbes campaign employee and former chairman of the Iowa Republican Party, added, "It's not like you have one big battle; you have 2,000 little ones."
Usually, about 100,000 Republicans -- roughly 20 percent of the total in the state -- show up at the caucuses. In a multicandidate field like the current one, the candidate who can get about 40,000 of those can win. In 1996, Mr. Dole won with 33,000 votes against Mr. Buchanan, Lamar Alexander, the former governor of Tennessee, and Mr. Forbes. Not only is the number of votes needed to win relatively small, but victory is entirely symbolic -- they are not binding on any Iowa delegate to the Republican National Convention.
How Mr. Forbes is approaching his campaign in Iowa is markedly different from his 1996 campaign, when he came in at the last minute with a series of negative television advertisements attacking Mr. Dole and had virtually no ground organization; Mr. Forbes ended up placing fourth. In addition, his reputation here was tarnished by the viciousness of his attacks on Mr. Dole, which only succeeded in damaging Mr. Dole's image nationally and labeling Mr. Forbes as a spoiler in his own party.
This time, the Forbes campaign here says, it has learned from those mistakes. "In 1996 we threw some ads up on the air, but we didn't have a ground game," Mr. Grubbs said. "This time we have a ground organization second to none to compete with Bush."
Mr. Forbes's broadcasting campaign consists of three television advertisements promoting his own views and making subtle digs at Mr. Bush, who has been criticized for his inexperience, especially in foreign affairs. One commercial shows Mr. Forbes with Ronald Reagan, highlights the candidate's "three decades of experience" and "vast knowledge" as publisher of the "foremost business magazine in the world," and maintains that Mr. Forbes's tenure at Radio Free Europe "helped play a role in the fall of Communism."
But will this all work? Iowa's five-term former Republican governor, Terry Branstad, who is a Bush supporter, said that while he believed that Mr. Bush had "a broader base and wider public support," Mr. Forbes was doing "much better" than in 1996: "He's got his bus tours, he's got his money, he's hired people who know how to run an organization and he's spending the time here."
Still, it is clear that Mr. Forbes has his work cut out for him.
"Forbes seems mean-spirited," said Joshua Bronsink, a Des Moines business consultant who attended a recent Chamber of Commerce luncheon here where Mr. Bush talked about his tax plan. "And I'm against a lot of what he says socially. Forbes is not electable, although I do think he will do well in Iowa. But, for me, he's always tearing people down and he's never been elected to anything before. That's why I'm for Bush."
Similar concerns were expressed at the Farm Bureau meeting. "I'm afraid people are tired of Forbes from last time around," said Don Wolhford, a Franklin County farmer. "People don't think he's electable, and they see Bush as a fresh face."

HEADLINE: Candidates Eager to Negotiate Cyberspace and Cyberissues

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 12

 BODY:
"Yours," Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah admonished Gov. George W. Bush of Texas during the first of the Republican presidential debates earlier this month, "is not user friendly."
As political zingers go, it might have been a bit lame. But that Mr. Hatch would use precious air time to criticize an opponent's Web site as "pretty tough to use" is only one indication of how the presidential candidates are confronting the Internet and technology generally, both as substantive issues and pervasive cultural forces. 
 They are raising money over the Internet. They are raising money from people who have grown rich from the Internet. They are debating how best to nurture the potential of the Internet while shielding children from pornography and consumers from potential misuse of data about them. And in the early stages of the first Internet-era national election, they are eager to let voters know they are as comfortable with a mouse as the next guy.
"The pace of candidate education is nearly as rapid as the pace of technological development," said Representative Christopher Cox of California, a Republican who is one of the few true techies in Congress.
Vice President Al Gore long ago dropped his paternity claim to the Internet. But Mr. Gore, who can sometimes be spotted with a Palm Pilot clipped to his belt, dropped into the CyberStop Cafe in Washington last week and with reporters and photographers watching sent an e-mail message to Bill Bradley, his rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, questioning his opponent's stand on Medicare.
Mr. Bradley has held electronic town hall meetings. And the Republican candidates have gone back and forth about technology issues regularly during their debates.
"In not very many years, politics has moved from a lot of smoke-filled rooms and ward bosses giving out turkeys to constituents to dueling e-mails," said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, a Democrat with a strong interest in technology issues. "This is an extraordinary transformation in politics. To reach the swing, independent voters who are going to decide about the 2000 elections you've got to talk about these issues."
The most politically charged of the issues may be whether and how to apply sales taxes to electronic commerce, and it is shaping up as a test of the candidates' views on the Internet in the economy and society.
Most governors and many local government officials are worried that as business migrates from Main Street and the mall to Amazon.com and Ebay, state governments will face a fiscal crisis, since online retailers for the most part are not required to collect sales taxes, the primary revenue source for states.
But in Washington, there is support in both parties for making the Internet a permanently tax-free shopping zone. A government commission studying the matter seems headed toward a deadlock.
The issue is particularly tricky for Mr. Bush, who is trying to establish his antitax credentials but shares the concerns of other governors that revenue losses from a shift to tax-free Internet shopping could leave states in a bind and hurt traditional retailers. Mr. Bush favors extending a moratorium against Internet taxes while the issue gets further study.
Mr. Bush's unwillingness to come out definitively against Internet sales taxes is being exploited by his rivals, who are suggesting obliquely that Mr. Bush is soft on taxes and maybe a bit of a Luddite to boot.
"The Internet should not be taxed," Senator John McCain of Arizona said. He extolled the Internet as "the greatest thing that's happened to the world," and compared its impact to a combination of the printing press and the industrial revolution.
"The governors are incredibly short-sighted when they want to tax this baby in its cradle," Mr. McCain said.
Mr. Hatch said it was "far overblown to think that the fact that people buy over the Internet is going to reduce Main Street U.S.A."
But the politics of technology can be complicated. Despite his message to Washington to "keep the government's mitts off" the industry, Mr. Hatch has been a supporter of the federal antitrust case against the Microsoft Corporation. He has been raising campaign funds from executives at some of Microsoft's rivals.
Steve Forbes, by contrast, says the Microsoft case is a waste of time and money, because the pace of change in the software business will render moot any court judgment.
The scramble to raise money from technology companies almost guarantees that candidates will continue to pay attention to the issues on the industry's mind.
Mr. Bush had raised $1.73 million from people affiliated with technology and communications companies through Oct. 15, while Mr. Gore had raised $1.54 million from them, Mr. Bradley $770,000 and Mr. McCain $500,000.
But the candidates seem fascinated and intrigued by the technology's potential to affect the world, not just dot-com companies.
Defending his support for bringing China into the World Trade Organization, Mr. Bush cited the Web's potential to communicate democratic values even in the face of opposition from a repressive regime.
"Imagine if the Internet took hold in China," Mr. Bush said. "Imagine how freedom would spread."

HEADLINE: The Big Ditch: Panama's Big Opportunity

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ 

DATELINE: PANAMA, Dec. 12

 BODY:
With the zest of salesmen and the zeal of patriots, Panamanian officials tout ambitious plans to convert sprawling acres of formerly off-limits properties along their famous canal into bustling commercial hubs and tropical tourist oases.
Smooth and practiced, they vow to create more jobs than the United States military presence here ever did, eagerly projecting millions of dollars in revenue to benefit social programs in health, education and housing. 
 But for a nation about to receive what amounts to a $5 billion bonanza, there have been few outward signs of celebration leading up to what on Tuesday will be the symbolic transfer of the Panama Canal and the thousands of buildings, airstrips and military installations along the waterway's 50-mile route from American to Panamanian hands.
Banners and billboards proclaiming the fulfillment of the 1977 treaties signed by President Jimmy Carter and Gen. Omar Torrijos to transfer control of the canal are noticeably lonely sights, reflecting Panamanian skittishness over the loss of American jobs and money and skepticism of their own government's ability. It is Panama's singular version of the Y2K problem: how to deal with a day that people once imagined would never come.
"It's 'gringo, stay home,' " said Guillermo Sanchez Borbon, a Panamanian writer who was exiled under the military government of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. "The Panamanians don't trust the politicians to keep this thing going. Now the gringos are going, and if anything goes wrong we have to fix it. And people are terrified. They don't trust the Panamanian government. They don't trust themselves."
The occasion is without question a landmark along Panama's path toward transforming itself from a nation both nurtured and overshadowed by the United States to a fully sovereign state intent on proving to its people and the world that it can succeed on its own.
Government officials here speak with the confidence and the coming-of-age emotion of a son leaving his father's house, an image that incidentally was also used when Panama declared its independence from Colombia in 1903.
But they know that full control of the canal and its properties brings with it enormous challenges and responsibilities for a country where corruption and partisan feuds have marked much of its political history.
While most of the properties, except the canal itself, have already been handed over and real control of the canal will not come until noon on Dec. 31, soon and for the first time Panama will have to develop its own national security plans and foreign policy to protect its borders and the canal.
And although the canal is already operated by almost an entirely Panamanian staff and will be overseen by an agency insulated from government meddling, officials must still seek to reassure the canal's users from all over the world that the operation of one of the world's most crucial passageways will remain safe and above board.
More mundane, but equally important, they will have to start attracting tourists to a place they usually passed through, and where most visitors came for business or banking.
Ambivalence over the handover has also been reflected in the United States, where conservatives have lambasted the "loss" of the canal and raised alarms about Panamanian ventures with Chinese firms.
Fear of a backlash may have been the reason that President Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright decided not to attend the events on Tuesday, but they have expressed confidence in Panama's ability to manage the enormous trust it is inheriting.
"Panama truly steps into a class of countries that have international responsibilities, because the canal is an international asset," said the United States ambassador, Simon Ferro. "How they manage the canal will in large measure dictate how they are viewed by the rest of the world. It is going to be a very interesting future for Panama and the United States."
Canal administrators said they have been preparing for years to make the transition as seamless as possible for the 14,000 ships that pass through the canal's locks on their route over the continental divide.
Most of the current employees running the canal have been retained. They have begun to modernize the fleet of locomotives and tugboats that guide ships through the passage, replacing ancient electric motors with hydraulic systems to open the gates. And they are completing a widening project that will allow bigger vessels to pass and is expected to lead to a 20 percent increase in traffic.
Sensitive to fears of corruption, patronage or relying on the canal to cover government spending, the agency will have its own labor laws, procurement procedures and fiscal controls to safeguard its financial independence.
Annual payments to the Panamanian government will be held for a year, to ensure that enough resources are available to maintain and operate the canal.
"The pinata attitude is not there," said Roberto Eisenmann, an adviser to President Mireya Moscoso. "This is not just a government entity that politicians can fight over to see who can get the spoils. It is a business. It depends on the confidence of its customers. A lot of other countries have a stake in what happens here."
Alberto Aleman Zubieta, the deputy administrator of the Panama Canal Commission, said the measures were also vital if Panama was going to make the best use of the canal and its properties.
"Obviously, our society has to understand as we do the tremendous importance of what we are doing here and use this route to make Panama what I think it will be," said Mr. Aleman Zubieta, who will head the Panama Canal Authority. "It is our destiny to become the major and most important hub for transshipment of containerized cargo in all of Latin America."
If it is to achieve that destiny, Panama must first deal with its recent past. Colombian guerrillas have made repeated incursions into the dense jungle to the south, and drug traffickers have settled into comfortable surroundings in the capital, where gleaming towers are home to condominiums and banks.
There are also worries about the canal being unprotected by United States troops, admittedly more of a psychological deterrent in recent years because of their decreasing numbers as bases closed.
Panamanian officials say they have adopted American-style security plans for the canal, although they have yet to reach an agreement with the United States on sharing information on ship traffic. Panama has also drawn up a national security plan that tries to balance all concerns.
"We have lived 20 years with border problems," said Winston Spadafora, the minister of government and justice. "But how long could Panama live without the canal? So we have prioritized the security of the canal and will then gradually develop the other areas of security."
Questions about security have been raised by critics of Panama's decision to award two port concessions to Hutchison Whampoa, a Hong Kong company that runs the largest container port in England.
The move was met with alarm by conservatives who say the company will be a puppet of the Chinese Army and could block American ships from entering the canal.
But Panamanian officials and their American supporters dismiss the contention, noting that the ports have no control over entry to the canal and that the transfer treaty allows for American intervention if the canal's neutrality is threatened.
"The anti-Chinese sentiment is based on a simple and profound motive," said Robert Pastor, a political scientist at Emory University. "At the simplest level, there are people who have not been informed that the cold war is over and we won it. China is a very large country and extraordinarily poor. It is simply not in our league."
Running the canal may prove easier than the gargantuan task of converting drab and utilitarian military bases into attractive money-making ventures. Already hundreds of houses have been sold at prices that are often lower than those of residences elsewhere in the city.
Still, the transformation is evident, and sometimes jarring, in an area that for several generations was the exclusive and grating domain of the Americans who ran the canal and the bases.
Construction crews are busy adding new windows, doors and rooms in what used to be the houses of high-ranking officers while couples move into low-slung cinder-block duplexes and Panamanian flags flutter on lawns.
"This was our land, but it was used by other people," said Francisco de Leon, a physician who moved his family into a three-bedroom house in Curundu. "All the history of Panama with the United States is here. Now we have a piece of that history too."
The real money and challenge lie in the development of the largest sites, especially the former Howard Air Force Base, where several companies have already expressed interest in converting the base into a regional transportation hub or aircraft maintenance center.
Elsewhere, the government has been soliciting proposals and bids for projects like manufacturing sites, ports and eco-lodges, some of which have already been built or are about to be developed.
The former Albrook Field, for instance, has been turned into an airport for civil aviation, and a cavernous shopping center is arising next to it. Officials talk of using the land around the canal to stimulate the creation of maritime and environmental businesses and institutes like the City of Knowledge, a research park planned for Fort Clayton.
"This is where we hope to bring the Intels of the world," said Nicolas Ardito Barletta, who was president of Panama in 1984-85 and now is the regional authority's general administrator. "We know it is an ambitious project. It will take 20 years to develop, but it has begun."
But ambition may also be a handicap. Ricardo Arias Calderon, Panama's first vice president from 1989 to 1992, said the nation had been given too much too soon, making it difficult to hold on to the properties until a potential investor could afford to buy into the grandest and most expensive projects. He says the regional authority has put its hopes on too many big and uncertain projects.
"It's like you are being sent a Chinese banquet with all the plates at once," he said. "There is pressure to carry things out rapidly. To do that, we have to be less sanguine about what we can get in money for what is developed."
Big plans were far from Orlando Cordoba's mind a few days ago, as he took a break from his bus driver's job sitting under the shade of a tree near Balboa High School. A few feet away, dozens of tiny Panamanian flags had been planted on the grass, echoing protests of years ago for the right to fly the national colors next to the Stars and Stripes in the areas ringing the canal.
The protests climaxed in January 1964, when several Panamanian students were killed during a confrontation with police officers protecting the Americans at the high school.
"That was a long time ago," said Mr. Cordoba, who was born that year. On the verge of seeing his country attain the goal that cost the lives of those students, he was left wondering about the price of nationalism. Christmas was not looking good. The millennium remains uncertain.
"I do not understand," he said. "Panama will be cleaned out, without money or anything. That was all the gringos produced. You know how many people worked in there? When they go, what's left?"

HEADLINE: MILITARY POSTURE OF EUROPE TO TURN MORE INDEPENDENT

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, Dec. 12

 BODY:
By deciding to equip itself to send up to 60,000 troops to a crisis zone like Bosnia or Kosovo, the European Union aims to become a strategic player that the United States and other countries will have to reckon with.
French officials, chafing under what some of them call American "hyperpower," have long wanted to make Europe a political and military power as well as an economic colossus. 
 Now other European leaders have adopted the military goal, agreeing at a meeting on Friday in Helsinki to build the command and planning staffs, intelligence bases, and the decision-making and deployment apparatus needed to realize their new ambition by 2003.
The allies in the 15-member union, including France, pledged that Europe's new military strength would not detract from, but instead would contribute to, the cohesion and effectiveness of the NATO alliance.
"If Europe takes on more responsibility by building up its military strength, that will contribute to the long-term equilibrium of the alliance," said Defense Minister Alain Richard of France in an interview. "Now the European Union is stepping up to its responsibilities and over the next few years will become a genuine actor on the scene, one that didn't exist before."
The allied military structure is led and dominated by the United States. During the recent NATO bombing campaign in Yugoslavia, it became clear that Europe was lagging in the ability to assemble or transport sizable peacekeeping forces quickly, and was in danger of falling far behind advanced American military technology, leading to the push for European improvements.
Germany's chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, recently explained his thinking, saying, "The Europe of the future must be able to defend its interests and values effectively worldwide." As far as Europe's military is concerned, he said, "close and confidential cooperation between the European Union and NATO" is essential. "There must and will be no thought of competition here," he added.
Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, without whose support the plan would never have been conceived, has also made clear that the NATO alliance would remain the bedrock of European security.
For the moment, American military and civilian officials are taking such assurances at face value.
Gen. Wesley K. Clark, the American who is NATO's top military commander, put it this way recently: "I think anything that increases the overall capabilities of the members of NATO in the defense area is commendable and we should be pushing it. We've got to make sure the institutions, as they emerge, and the linkages, as they emerge, in fact do that."
The main American concern, as General Clark put it, is "decoupling or duplication or discrimination against non-European Union, European members of NATO," and here the new European plan has the potential to cause long-term irritation for the United States.
Mr. Richard, the French defense minister, concedes the possibility for concern. "What fear of duplication really conceals is worry about the appearance of a new political partner, the European Union," he said. "It's a new situation that's a bit disturbing, that upsets old habits, because at the moment, inside the Atlantic alliance, there are only dispersed European states -- the only common, cohesive element is NATO itself."
He and other French officials said the military staff that the European Union would set up in Brussels would be nowhere near the size of the NATO military staff, down the road at General Clark's headquarters in Mons. A European military secretariat reporting to Javier Solana, former secretary general of the alliance, will decide how many military planners the European Union needs in a new general staff, Mr. Richard said.
"I'm persuaded that it should be basically rather modest," he said. Other French officials said a European general staff would probably number no more than a few hundred officers, who would draw heavily on planning done by their counterparts in the member states.
The new European defense structure would also include a military committee of chiefs of national defense staffs to advise the European leaders, who would decide when and where to send forces. The 60,000 troops earmarked for European use in a crisis would be the same ones NATO could use if it decided to get involved, French officials said.
Mr. Richard said the European plan is consistent with the alliance's "defense capabilities initiative," a plan adopted at a NATO summit meeting last April to improve the effectiveness of future multinational military operations like the bombing campaign in Yugoslavia.
"The requirements, the performance levels, the expected specifications are all the same," Mr. Richard said, and duplication will be minimal, though American officials are not so sure.
Mr. Richard contends that the United States should help contribute to a new strategic balance within the alliance by allowing the American military to buy more arms from European defense industries.
"I have told our American friends several times that in our opinion -- and this isn't just a French view -- even if it's unintended, security regulations and limits on access to the American market are a real impediment to the existence of a trans-Atlantic market," he said. "It's a delicate subject, because it has to do with national security concerns that are legitimate and respectable, and it's not a subject that will be solved with loud public discussions."
American officials in Europe agree and are concerned that resentment at American strategic, technological and economic superiority could bring a resurgence of anti-Americanism.
"Fiery rhetoric and anti-American tirades by some senior leaders in Europe complicate this situation immensely, and are difficult to ignore on our side of the Atlantic," Jacques S. Gansler, a senior Pentagon official, warned a gathering of French defense industrialists in Toulouse last week.
In Washington, France has not been seen as trustworthy in handling American defense secrets as Britain is. Mr. Gansler said in Toulouse that the United States wants more trans-Atlantic defense industry cooperation but insisted that effective safeguards by the allies for the American technology they wanted were "an absolute prerequisite."
Mr. Richard said, "I think the United States side needs to think about this to see if they aren't in danger of closing the American market to European producers."
But it was Britain, which long refused to discuss with its European partners any security arrangements outside of NATO, that finally allowed France to achieve its longstanding ambition to lead Europe to a modest autonomous defense capability of its own. Mr. Blair agreed on that objective with President Jacques Chirac of France more than a year ago, setting the stage for European leaders to adopt the plan last June in Cologne and to spell it out during the weekend in Helsinki.
At the insistence of Britain and other allies, including Germany and the Netherlands, the leaders agreed that Europe would deploy forces on its own only in situations where the alliance -- meaning, in effect, the United States -- had decided not to get involved.
"That's the condition, that's the agreement," Mr. Richard said, adding that he had told Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen in Brussels early this month that France and the United States were pulling on the same string by insisting that some of the allies should increase defense spending, for NATO's sake as well as for Europe's.
"I think it's not realistic for Europeans to say we are spending enough and that all we need to do is create more synergy and achieve more efficient cooperation," Mr. Richard said. He said he thought that the commitment made for spending on new equipment was less than what it should be.
According to alliance figures, the United States spends about 3.2 percent of its gross domestic product on defense, down from 6 percent during the cold war, with France and Britain spending 2.8 and 2.6 percent, respectively. But Germany spends only 1.5 percent and Spain 1.4 percent.
France, another French defense official said, will press its European partners to set spending targets for buying the new satellite-based navigation and guidance systems, fighter planes and transport aircraft that will be needed to make a European fighting force ready to be deployed within 60 days, the target set by the Helsinki plan.
"It may be easier, actually, for the Europeans to agree not to fall below these spending targets than it would be for them to agree to them as part of a NATO plan," the French official said. "There they could always fall short and say the United States had pressed them to accept unrealistic goals."

The Curse of Bigness

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Competition is the driving force of free enterprise. Concentrated power is the greatest danger to capitalism.
Two government watchdogs are charged with protecting competition: the Justice Department's antitrust division, a creature of the executive branch, and the Federal Trade Commission, an independent agency created by Congress. 
 Oversight pays for itself; indeed, Justice brings in $10 in fines for every $1 in its budget. But the F.T.C. and Justice are overwhelmed by the rising momentum toward concentration throughout American big business.
If AT&T ultimately faces off against the proposed MCI-Worldcom-Sprint merger, the two would control 70 percent of their market, a monopoly in anybody's league. And monopolies lead to regulation, with government as the cartel-keeper. A return to regulation is what we do not want.
Such companies are so big, goes the anti-antitrust argument, that only another behemoth can compete. But that's how you get down to two oil companies, two telecommunications combines and two bank-brokerage-insurance leviathans. The ability for only two to fix prices or squelch innovation becomes infinitely easier.
Let's explode a few of the myths those superpowers are spreading:
Myth No. 1: Globalization requires American-based multinational giants to compete with giants overseas. But the weaknesses of Japan's keiretsu and South Korea's chaebol have been manifest for a decade, and Europe is now reacting against the anti-innovative sclerosis of corporate giantism. As our trading partners discover the economic blessings of antitrust enforcement, why should the U.S. now take the route of semi-monopoly? That only leads to another cycle of regulation.
Myth No. 2: Democrats crack down on too-big business, while Republicans defend it. In truth, enforcement has been a mixed bag. Teddy Roosevelt invented trust-busting; Dwight Eisenhower's Justice Department aggressively defended competition. Compared with them, Republican Reagan's record (except for AT&T) was poor and Democrat Clinton's (except for Microsoft) is fair.
Myth No. 3: If a cartel or an industry with only two companies can deliver the efficiencies of low cost, the consumer benefits. This "Chicago school" theory of the 80's made deregulation and apparent consumer benefit our mantra -- but have you noticed what monopoly hubs have done to airline fares and service? Clinton antitrust finally moved against American Airlines, but other big carriers are getting away with skyway robbery.
Myth No. 4: Mere size is no sin; each case should be handled on its own merits. Under this philosophy, the F.T.C. smiles on the Exxon-Mobil merger, says maybe to Dow-Union Carbide and probably no to BP Amoco and Atlantic Richfield. But it is the momentum of merger mania that cries out to be reversed; long-range impact is not being considered.
Myth No. 5: Technology is changing so fast that a little pipsqueak company can bring a giant to its knees. For every time that happens, a thousand small-cap operations are driven out of business or absorbed by the giant out to cover its corporate posterior. When competition gets down to two huge entities, it becomes an arrangement that can buy Congressional protection.
On that last myth, the megamerger crowd -- oligarchs who enjoy the safety of hugeness, with their go-go investment bankers and not-to-worry lawyers -- insists that opponents to upsizing cannot foresee changes to come. Albert Foer, at antitrustinstitute.org, derides such "proclaimed fears of future competition." He notes that the antitrust law's key phrases -- "may lessen competition" and "tend to create a monopoly" -- use verbs that require a forecast of the future. In that prediction business, we should err on the side of competition.
I had breakfast with Joel Klein, the current antitrust chief. He says all the right philosophic things: "If you don't have antitrust enforcement, you get government regulation, which is worse." And on the rash of innovation-stifling megamergers, which one of his successors will one day have to break up? "Not getting married is preferable to divorce."
But the conservative zeal to protect competition -- beyond the minuet of the monoliths -- is missing in Congress and the White House, and is not mentioned on the campaign trail. Embittered divorces lie ahead.

HEADLINE: Now Appearing in Borscht Belt: Developers Banking on a Casino

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

DATELINE: MONTICELLO, N.Y.

 BODY:
Gene Barbanti, a real estate broker from New Jersey, moved to the Catskills 30 years ago and bought some land cheap, thinking that the borscht belt had nowhere to go but up.
Instead, the bungalow colonies and grand hotels where Danny Kaye, Milton Berle and Buddy Hackett once entertained vacationing New Yorkers died a lingering death over the next three decades. It left Sullivan County a depressed land of relics, 90 miles northwest of Manhattan. 
 But with the growing possibility of a $500 million casino opening in Monticello, Mr. Barbanti has emerged in the last year as the unofficial grand marshal of the great Sullivan County land rush. He recently sold the 236-acre Shawanga Lodge property in Wurtsboro and the old Laurels resort on Sackett Lake in Thompson and is completing the sale of an 800-acre tract in Wurtsboro Hills. In all, powerful and well-connected investors and developers have bought more than $40 million worth of woodland, dormant hotels and golf courses in 10 major deals over the last year, with plans to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in resorts, second-home communities and attractions.
"This is not your grandfather's Catskills anymore," Mr. Barbanti said at his office in Liberty, where storefront after storefront sits hauntingly empty. "This is a place waiting to be rediscovered and I think we're on the threshold."
Hopes for a Catskill revival have fallen flat in the past. But with Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt likely to decide by January or February whether to approve a casino proposed by the St. Regis Mohawks next to the Monticello Raceway, more money and muscle are betting on it. And as developers continue to propose ambitious, big-dollar projects, the future of the Catskills seems increasingly tied to two factors. The first is whether the region will get casino gambling. The second is whether it can revive without it.
For decades, gambling has been held up as a tantalizing cure-all for the region's economic doldrums. But now many advocates expect Mr. Babbitt to approve the tribe's casino application and send it to Gov. George E. Pataki for a final decision. Although the governor has not indicated what he will do, Mr. Pataki thinks casinos "make economic sense in traditional resort areas like the Catskills," said his spokesman, Michael McKeon. With politically connected developers like as Louis R. Cappelli and David Flaum, many of them major Republican contributors, suddenly buying property in Sullivan County, expectations are running high.
"A fair amount of people are positioning themselves for the potential of gaming," said Mark Kutsher, who runs one of the few remaining resorts from the borscht belt days, Kutsher's Country Club in Monticello. "Those of us who are still here have always felt the area had intrinsic value."
Local officials acknowledge that the prospect of gambling is at least partly responsible for the land boom. But they also say that Sullivan County has developed an economic and tourism plan that does not rely on gambling or the old resorts. The county plans to build an industrial park with fiber-optic connections next spring, and it has helped renovate 70 sagging storefronts in Monticello and elsewhere. It has also demolished 100 abandoned hotels and bungalow colonies, what the county manager, Jonathan Drapkin, calls the "flotsam and jetsam of the borscht belt era."
"Gaming is probably a keystone piece of our economic redevelopment," said Gary Sommers, the mayor of Monticello, "but it's only a piece. If we don't do the other elements of our economic plan, the village will die around the casino."
Broadway, the main shopping strip in Monticello, looks faded and undernourished, not at all like the photograph on Mr. Sommers's wall, which depicts a bustling street jammed with cars and shoppers. Today, a third of the households in the county, which has a population of 69,000, have income of less than $26,000 a year.
A revival would be the third wave of prosperity to wash over the Catskills. From the 1890's until World War I, the cool mountains and lakes of the area were a favorite respite from the city's heat and tuberculosis for Italian and Irish immigrants.
During the golden age of the Catskills, from 1940 to the mid-1960's, the region became a vacation haven for Jewish immigrants who flocked to as many as 500 hotels that offered tennis, swimming, elaborate social programs and legendary nightclub entertainment. But with advent of inexpensive air fares and the popularity of European vacations, the Catskills lost their luster. Today, only a handful of hotels remain.
"What's kept us from moving forward for the last 20 years," said John Conway, the Sullivan County historian, "was that so many people put all their energy into saving those dinosaurs. People are beginning to realize that we are a viable tourist destination even without the resorts. Indian gaming would add to the appeal."
The proposed 1.8 million-square-foot casino complex would be built next to the harness track in Monticello, which has been losing money for years. Under the proposal, Robert A. Berman and Cliff Ehrlich, two local businessmen who own the track, would give 30 acres to the St. Regis Mohawks and build and operate the casino for the tribe, which would contribute $5 million a year to the county and village to mitigate the negative effects of the casino, including increased traffic. The two men and their partners would enlarge the track and develop the surrounding 200 acres.
Mr. Berman and his partners, who include Joseph Bernstein of Americas Partners and Alpha Hospitality, are a politically formidable group. They have contributed more than $160,000 to state and national Republicans since 1995. Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the state's economic development agency, was a director of Alpha Hospitality until he stepped down in 1995, and he remains friendly with the company's chairman, Stanley S. Tollman.
Sullivan County officials hope the current boomlet will survive even if the bid for a casino fails. With Americans increasingly taking long weekends, rather than long vacations, investors and local officials say the county should benefit from its position astride a three-state market.
"I hope that it's not all because of gambling, because if gambling doesn't come, they'll all pull out," Ira Jay Cohen, the county attorney, said of investors.
Most developers say their plans do not depend on gambling, although a casino would certainly enhance their investment. In the meantime, county officials are providing tax breaks and other incentives.
Mr. Flaum, the Rochester developer who paid $650,000, or roughly $3,000 an acre, for the Shawanga Lodge property, said that Sullivan County's rock-bottom land prices were very attractive. Mr. Flaum, who has contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to state and national Republicans, said he planned to build a 250-room hotel and convention center.
Mr. Cappelli, a wealthy Westchester developer, made the biggest splash at bankruptcy court sales earlier this year when he paid a total of $16.25 million for the two largest and most famous old resorts: the Concord at Kiamesha Lake, and Grossinger's in Liberty. Mr. Cappelli, who built the Sullivan County government building in the early 1970's, said he planned to build a new 1,000-room convention hotel at the Concord, which has a legendary golf course known as the Monster, and a 200-room spa at Grossinger's.
The two properties had teetered in and out of bankruptcy for more than decade with a succession of owners. Citing the report of a hotel consultant, Mr. Cappelli said he could succeed where others failed because he had more money and experience in renovation projects.
Mr. Cappelli, his companies, his family and his partner, an affiliate of Reckson Associates Realty Corporation, have contributed more than $160,000 to state and national Republicans since 1995. Both partners have surfaced in an investigation by the Manhattan district attorney into bidding irregularities in the sale of state land on Long Island and in a inquiry into possible political favoritism by the state's economic development agency and its chairman, Mr. Gargano.
Although Reckson Associates, which had formed a partnership with Mr. Cappelli, was declared the winning bidder for the Long Island property, the state recently decided to hold a new auction, which Mr. Cappelli said might be challenged in court.
Mr. Cappelli vehemently defended himself, saying he was being penalized for making legal political contributions. He said he was cooperating with prosecutors, but he declined to say why he had rebuffed requests for an interview by the district attorney. Though Mr. Pataki and Mr. Gargano have visited him at his summer house in the Hamptons, Mr. Cappelli said he had talked to neither man about the Long Island property, gambling or his Catskill investments.
"It's a business investment," Mr. Cappelli said. "It's an apolitical deal. It'll be successful with or without gaming because there are 55 million people within a four-hour drive."
Mr. Cappelli said he would definitely start construction on a new hotel at the Concord next June.
By then, critics note, it should be clear whether the casino will go forward. County officials said privately that if the casino project is rejected, they expected Mr. Cappelli to forgo his plans at the Concord and simply build the spa at Grossinger's.
"Cappelli bought the Concord and Grossinger's because he hopes and believes he'll get a piece of the action," said Lee Karr, chairman of the Coalition Against Casino Gambling and a rare vocal opponent of gambling in Sullivan County. "He's demonstrated that he's not going to hammer one nail until there's gambling."
Joshua Muss, a developer who owns 500 acres next to Grossinger's, built 11 models for a residential community a decade ago, is waiting to see if the time has finally come for the Catskills. Other developers like Bruce Ratner of Forest City Ratner in Brooklyn and David S. Cordish of Baltimore have looked at properties in the Catskills and passed.
"I know there are people putting down real money on those old resorts, and I hope they're right," Mr. Cordish said. "But I can't see it without gambling."
Mr. Berman said the casino's fate should be decided on its merits, which he believes are considerable, and not through politics. He said the casino would employ 3,000 people, draw six million visitors a year and generate $100 million a year in revenue for the state.
"The casino is the only thing that can serve as a catalyst for reviving the region," Mr. Berman said. "I don't see anything else that will create this level of economic benefit."
But Russell W. Galbut, a managing principal at Crescent Heights Investments, said his real estate company, which is based in Miami, would go forward with plans to build what might be a $250 million hotel, conference center and residential community around a golf course on 800 acres the company is buying in Wurtsboro Hills.
"I don't think you can get a better site than our 800 acres, but our plans are not predicated on a casino," Mr. Galbut said. "We have the closest site to Manhattan and it's on a mountain. It's a secondary home location set in a region that is much more beautiful than the Hamptons."

HEADLINE: For School Districts Sullied By Corrupt Past, New Doubt

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
When investigators charged last week that teachers and principals in 18 of New York City's 33 school districts had helped students cheat on standardized tests, it came as no surprise to veteran school officials that several of the implicated districts had long histories of corruption.
Five schools cited in the investigators' report are in Community School District 9 in the Bronx, where various school officials and school board members were indicted in the 1980's and early 1990's on charges including taking bribes from textbook salesmen, stealing a school piano and spending school funds on lavish restaurant meals. In perhaps the most notorious incident, an elementary school principal was caught buying crack cocaine in 1988. 
 District 12, which is also in the Bronx and is home to two of the schools cited in the cheating report, has been the focus of repeated investigations into patronage hirings; in 1993, a principal there was caught on videotape paying a bribe of $2,000 for her job. The district's superintendent committed suicide that same year after investigators accused him of stealing more than $100,000 from two antipoverty agencies.
Although most of the wrongdoing in those districts has taken place outside the classroom, it has created an atmosphere of cynicism and apathy that has filtered down to teachers, people who study the school system say. While the stepped-up pressure to improve test scores is increasing the likelihood of cheating in even the most dedicated schools, they say, it makes sense that schools with histories of ethical lapses would be the first to succumb.
"There's no question that the lack of a professional culture in these districts encourages the kind of behavior that leads to cheating," said Norm Fruchter, director of the Institute for Education and Social Policy at New York University and a former school board member in Brooklyn's District 15. "It's easier not to hold yourself accountable when nobody is encouraging you to do the right thing."
Districts 9 and 12, along with several others implicated in the cheating incidents, encompass some of the city's poorest neighborhoods, with high unemployment rates and residents for whom the school system is as much about jobs for adults as it is about education for children.
After the city school system was decentralized in the 1960's to give more control to community school boards, the hiring of school administrators and even teachers in those districts became a highly politicized process, with some board members serving as unofficial proxies for neighborhood political leaders who used them to dole out patronage jobs and other favors.
Patronage hiring has been less common since 1996, when the State Legislature took away the hiring powers of the community school boards and broadened the powers of the schools chancellor. But even with increased power, Chancellor Rudy Crew has had difficulty rooting out corruption in the city's 1,100 schools.
"No law is going to change deep-seated patterns overnight," said Robert Berne, vice president for academic development at New York University. "It requires a lot of oversight and a lot of aggressive action."
Several of the educators accused of helping students cheat were the subject of earlier investigations into favoritism and patronage hiring. Evelyn Hey, the principal of Public School 234 in the Crotona section of the Bronx, was removed from that post in 1993 after an investigation found that she had been hired because she was the girlfriend of a former school board member.
Ms. Hey was later reinstated, but in his report on cheating, Edward F. Stancik, the special investigator for New York City schools, alleged that she had used a combination of cheating schemes at P.S. 234 and had encouraged her teachers to do the same. Average reading scores at her school rose by 22 percent from 1997 to 1998, the report found.
At the Petrides School on Staten Island, a magnet school where a teacher was accused of prompting at least one student to change her answers on reading and math tests, a 1998 investigation by Mr. Stancik found that officials had been selecting students related to school officials and government employees instead of by random lottery.
Another school official cited in the cheating report, Richard Wallin, the former principal of Community Elementary School 90 in the Bronx, was transferred to the District 9 office in 1998 after he was accused of using proceeds from school fund-raisers and funds earmarked for teachers to buy security equipment for his office and to expand his collection of exotic animals.
One thing that should help, Mr. Berne said, is a new contract for the union representing principals that replaces lifetime tenure with three-year renewable contracts. Under the agreement, which has not been finalized, principals are also supposed to receive a raise of 33 percent, after four years with no raise at all.
"Changing the school leadership is the best means we have of changing the school culture," Mr. Berne said.
Others warn that another aspect of the new principals' contract -- annual evaluations based partly on student test scores -- could encourage further cheating, and not necessarily only in districts with histories of corruption. They say the emphasis on testing has spurred cheating incidents in even the wealthiest and most successful school systems.
In Fairfield, Conn., the principal of an elementary school acclaimed for its high test scores resigned in 1997 after he was accused of changing students' answers on standardized tests. In Lake Forest, Ill., a wealthy suburb of Chicago, a principal was fired after she was accused of encouraging faculty members to help students cheat on such tests.
Theodore R. Sizer, a former dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Education, said he believed that increasing pressure to raise test scores, rather than a history of corruption, led to cheating.
"It's plausible that corruption in the principal's office or people pilfering books from the school library affects how teachers behave," Mr. Sizer said.
"But more likely, teachers are angry about forcing kids to take tests that reasonable people find stupid, and that the teachers don't take very seriously."
Others contend that while the emphasis on test scores will inevitably lead to some cheating, it will limit the possibility of corruption inside and outside the classroom by forcing school districts to hire only competent and dedicated principals and teachers.
"If there is greater public pressure for kids to do well as judged by their test scores, it will be a lot harder to hire cronies," Mr. Berne said. "Schools will be less willing to pay the price of having incompetent and dishonest people."

Ah, the poor Stone Age woman of our kitschy imagination. When she isn't getting bonked over the head with a club and dragged across the cave floor by her matted hair, she's hunched over a fire, poking at a roasting mammoth thigh while her husband retreats to his cave studio to immortalize the mammoth hunt in fresco. Or she's Raquel Welch, saber-toothed sex kitten, or Wilma Flintstone, the original Roccer Mom. But whatever her form, her garb is the same: some sort of animal pelt, cut nasty, brutish and short.
Now, according to three anthropologists, it is time to toss such hidebound cliches of Paleolithic woman on the midden heap of prehistory. In a new analysis of the renowned "Venus" figurines, the hand-size statuettes of female bodies carved from 27,000 to 20,000 years ago, the researchers have found evidence that the women of the so-called upper Paleolithic era were far more accomplished, economically powerful and sartorially gifted than previously believed. 
 As the researchers see it, subtle but intricate details on a number of the figurines offer the most compelling evidence yet that Paleolithic women had already mastered a revolutionary skill long thought to have arisen much later in human history: the ability to weave plant fibers into cloth, rope, nets and baskets.
And with a flair for textile production came a novel approach to adorning and flaunting the human form. Far from being restricted to a wardrobe of what Dr. Olga Soffer, one of the researchers, calls "smelly animal hides," Paleolithic people knew how to create fine fabrics that very likely resembled linen. They designed string skirts, slung low on the hips or belted up on the waist, which artfully revealed at least as much as they concealed. They wove elaborate caps and snoods for the head, and bandeaux for the chest -- a series of straps that amounted to a cupless brassiere.
"Some of the textiles they had must have been incredibly fine, comparable to something from Donna Karan or Calvin Klein," said Dr. Soffer, an archaeologist with the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign.
Archaeologists and anthropologists have long been fascinated by the Venus figurines and have theorized endlessly about their origin and purpose. But nearly all of that speculation has centered on the exaggerated body parts of some of the figurines: the huge breasts, the bulging thighs and bellies, the well-defined vulvas. Hence, researchers have suggested that the figurines were fertility fetishes, or prehistoric erotica, or gynecology primers.
"Because they have emotionally charged thingies like breasts and buttocks, the Venus figurines have been the subject of more spilled ink than anything I know of," Dr. Soffer said. "There are as many opinions on them as there are people in field."
In their new report, which will be published in the spring in the journal Current Anthropology, Dr. Soffer and her colleagues, Dr. James M. Adovasio and Dr. David C. Hyland of the Mercyhurst Archaeological Institute at Mercyhurst College in Erie, Pa., point out that voluptuous body parts notwithstanding, a number of the figurines are shown wearing items of clothing. And when they zeroed in on the details of those carved garments, the researchers saw proof of considerable textile craftsmanship, an intimate knowledge of how fabric is woven.
"Scholars have been looking at these things for years, but unfortunately, their minds have been elsewhere," Dr. Adovasio said. "Most of them didn't recognize the clothing as clothing. If they noticed anything at all, they misinterpreted what they saw, writing off the bandeaux, for example, as tattoos or body art."
Scrutinizing the famed Venus of Willendorf, for example, which was discovered in lower Austria in 1908, the researchers paid particular attention to the statuette's head. The Venus has no face to speak of, but detailed coils surround its scalp. Most scholars have interpreted the coils as a kind of paleo-coiffure, but Dr. Adovasio, an authority on textiles and basketry, recognized the plaiting as what he called a "radially sewn piece of headgear with vertical stem stitches."
Willendorf's haberdashery "might have looked like one of those woven hats you see on Jamaicans on the streets of New York," he said, adding, "These were cool things."
On the Venus of Lespugue, an approximately 25,000-year-old figurine from southwestern France, the anthropologists noticed a "remarkable" degree of detail lavished on the rendering of a string skirt, with the tightness and angle of each individual twist of the fibers carefully delineated. The skirt is attached to a low-slung hip belt and tapers in the back to a tail, the edges of its hem deliberately frayed.
"That skirt is to die for," said Dr. Soffer, who, before she turned to archaeology, was in the fashion business. "Though maybe it's an acquired taste."
To get an idea of what such an outfit might have looked like, she said, imagine a hula dancer wrapping a 1930's-style beaded curtain around her waist. "We're not talking protection from the elements here," Dr. Soffer said. "This would have been ritual wear, if it was worn at all, a way of communicating with higher powers."
Other anthropologists point out that string skirts, which appear in Bronze-Age artifacts and are mentioned by Homer, may have been worn at the equivalent of a debutantes ball, to advertise a girl's coming of age. In some parts of Eastern Europe, the skirts still survive as lacy elements of folk costumes.
The researchers presented their results earlier this month at a meeting on the importance of perishables in prehistory that was held at the University of Florida in Gainesville. "One of the most common reactions we heard was, 'How could we have missed that stuff all these years?' " Dr. Adovasio said.
Dr. Margaret W. Conkey, a professor of anthropology at the University of California at Berkeley, and co-editor, with Joan Gero, of "Engendering Archaeology" (Blackwell Publishers, 1991) said, "They're helping us to look at old materials in new ways, to which I say bravo!"
Not all scholars had been blinded by the Venutian morphology. Dr. Elizabeth Wayland Barber, a professor of archaeology and linguistics at Occidental College in Los Angeles, included in her 1991 volume "Prehistoric Textiles," a chapter arguing that some Venus figurines were wearing string skirts. The recent work from Dr. Soffer and her colleagues extends and amplifies on the Dr. Barber's original observations.
The new work also underscores the often neglected importance of what Dr. Barber has termed the "string revolution." Archaeologists have long emphasized the invention of stone and metal tools in furthering the evolution of human culture. Even the names given to various periods in human history and prehistory are based on heavyweight tools: the word "Paleolithic" -- the period extending from about 750,000 years ago to 15,000 years ago -- essentially means "Old Stone Age." And duly thudding and clanking after the Paleolithic period were the Mesolithic and Neolithic, or Middle and New Stone Age, the Bronze Age, the Iron Age, the Industrial Age.
But at least as central to the course of human affairs as the invention of stone tools was the realization that plant products could be exploited for purposes other than eating. The fact that some of the Venus figurines are shown wearing string skirts, said Dr. Barber, "means that the people who made them must also have known how to make twisted string."
With the invention of string and the power to weave, people could construct elaborate yet lightweight containers in which to carry, store and cook food. They could fashion baby slings to secure an infant snugly against its mother's body, thereby freeing up the woman to work and wander. They could braid nets, the better to catch prey animals without the risk of hand-to-tooth combat. They could lash together wooden logs or planks to build a boat.
"The string revolution was a profound event in human history," Dr. Adovasio said. "When people started to fool around with plants and plant byproducts, that opened vast new avenues of human progress."
In the new report, the researchers argue that women are likely to have been the primary weavers and textile experts of prehistory, and may have even initiated the string revolution in the first place -- although men undoubtedly did their share of weaving when it came to making hunting and fishing nets, for example. They base that conclusion on modern crosscultural studies, which have found that women constitute the great bulk of the world's weavers, basketry makers and all-round mistresses of plant goods.
But while vast changes in manufacturing took the luster off the textile business long ago, with the result that such "women's work" is now accorded low status and sweatshop wages, the researchers argue that weaving and other forms of fiber craft once commanded great prestige. By their estimate, the detailing of the stitches shown on some of the Venus figurines was intended to flaunt the value and beauty of the original spinsters' skills. Why else would anybody have bothered etching the stitchery in a permanent medium, if not to boast, whoa! Check out these wefts!
"It's made immortal in stone," Dr. Soffer said. "You don't carve something like this unless it's very important."
The detailing of the Venutian garb also raises the intriguing possibility that the famed little sculptures, which rank right up there with the Lascaux cave paintings in the pantheon of Western art, were hewn by women -- moonlighting seamstresses, to be precise. "It's always assumed that the carvers were men, a bunch of guys sitting around making their zaftig Barbie dolls," Dr. Soffer said. "But maybe that wasn't the case, or not always the case. With some of these figurines, the person carving them clearly knew weaving. So either that person was a weaver herself, or he was living with her. He's got an adviser."
Durable though the Venus figurines are, Dr. Adovasio and his co-workers are far more interested in what their carved detailing says about the role of perishables in prehistory. "The vast bulk of what humans made was made in media that hasn't survived," Dr. Adovasio said. Experts estimate the ratio of perishable objects to durable objects generated in the average culture is about 20 to 1.
"We're reconstructing the past based on 5 percent of what was used," Dr. Soffer said.
Because many of the items that have endured over the millennia are things like arrowheads and spear points, archaeologists studying the Paleolithic era have generally focused on the ways and means of that noble savage, a k a Man the Hunter, to the exclusion of other members of the tribe.
"To this day, in Paleolithic studies we hear about Man the Hunter doing such boldy wonderful things as thrusting spears into woolly mammoths, or battling it out with other men," Dr. Adovasio said. "We've emphasized the activities of a small segment of the population -- healthy young men -- at the total absence of females, old people of either sex and children. We've glorified one aspect of Paleolithic life ways at the expense of all the other things that made that life way successful."
Textiles are particularly fleeting. The oldest examples of fabric yet discovered are some carbonate-encrusted swatches from France that are about 18,000 years old, while pieces of cordage and string dating back 19,000 years have been unearthed in the Near East, many thousands of years after the string and textile revolution began.
In an effort to study ancient textiles in the absence of textiles, Dr. Soffer, Dr. Adovasio and Dr. Hyland have sought indirect signs of textile manufacture. They have pored over thousands of ancient fragments of fired and unfired clay, and have found impressions of early textiles on a number of them, the oldest dating to 29,000 B.C. But the researchers believe that textile manufacture far predates this time period, for the sophistication of the stitchery rules out it's being, as Dr. Soffer put it, "what you take home from Crafts 101." Dr. Adovasio estimates that weaving and cord-making probably goes back to the year 40,000 B.C. "at a minimum," and possibly much further.
Long before people had settled down into towns with domesticated plants and animals, then, while they were still foragers and wanderers, they had, in a sense, tamed nature. The likeliest sort of plants from which they extracted fibers were nettles. "Nettle in folk tales and mythology is said to have magic properties," Dr. Soffer said. "In one story by the Brothers Grimm, a girl whose two brothers have been turned into swans has to weave them nettle shirts by midnight to make them human again." The nettles stung her fingers, but she kept on weaving.
But what didn't make it into Grimms' was that when the girl was done with the shirts, she took out a chisel, and carved herself a Venus figurine.

The New York Fix

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS 

 BODY:
Every state has shortcomings that its residents don't like to talk about. Wherever you live, I'm sure there are local embarrassments you'd prefer not to see broadcast in the national media -- monster pig farms, a demented governor, whatever. I myself grew up in a Midwestern city that once elected Jerry Springer mayor, and you don't see me bringing it up every time I go back there to visit.
Nevertheless, we've got to have a little discussion about New York election laws. The state Republican Party has fixed the March 7 presidential primary so that John McCain is finding it almost impossible to get on the ballot. If you like Mr. McCain, that ought to make you angry. If you like George W. Bush you ought to be angry too. The man has pots and pots of money and the endorsement of every powerful Republican in the state. You don't want people thinking that with all that, he still needs to slash the other team's tires to win. 
 The Republicans are just operating within the local political culture, which says that the only good election is an uncontested election. In most of America, the person with the most votes wins. Here, the person with the best election lawyer throws everybody else off the ballot. "It's like Chinese water torture, only not as much fun," said Gerry O'Brien, the McCain state political director.
To run in the Republican presidential primary in New York you've got to put together a delegate slate in every one of the state's 31 Congressional districts, some of which have more politically active Zoroastrians than Republicans. Workers residing in each of these districts then have the month of December to collect signatures of local party members, in rigid conformance to the incredibly picky election law standards. The names must then be alphabetized by the seventh son of a seventh son, born under the sign of the Great Auk.
I was making up that last part. Although you never know.
Four years ago, organizers for Steve Forbes got his signatures in heavily Democratic New York City districts by recruiting unemployed minority teen-agers, registering them as Republicans and paying them sizable weekly salaries to go door-to-door. "It was a political 'Stand and Deliver,' " one of the organizers told me proudly. "It would have made a great movie."
Well, it's hard to envision a feel-good movie that ends with Steve Forbes qualifying for the New York primary ballot. Nevertheless, it was nice knowing that the state's election laws were finally being used to create jobs for somebody besides election lawyers. This year the Forbes campaign is paying $12 an hour for signature collectors, and expects to spend at least $750,000 getting the candidate on the New York ballot.
This is an even crazier procedure than the Iowa straw poll, which everybody was complaining so bitterly about last summer. Sure, the Iowa Republicans made the candidates pay a kind of head tax for every supporter who wanted to vote. But at least they didn't do it during the Christmas shopping season.
Only super-wealthy candidates can put together enough resources to get on the New York ballot without the support of the party organization. Mr. Forbes is just about the only Republican who's managed to pull the trick off in recent history. Paul Tsongas barely qualified for the Democratic primary in 1992, and that near miss so embarrassed the party that it made its rules rational.
Mr. McCain said last week that if he failed to get on the statewide ballot, he was going to go to court. He called on Gov. George Pataki and other party leaders to disavow the rules and help all serious candidates qualify for the primary. Mr. Pataki, who reportedly nurtures hopes of being Mr. Bush's vice-presidential nominee on an All-George ticket, ignored the request.
"The Republican Party won't bend the rules to accommodate Mr. McCain while he spends time campaigning in other states," said the governor's spokeswoman. Mr. Bush, she noted, has already done mailings in New York, and made several campaign appearances. "We want this state to play a vital role in the election process," she said.
This is perhaps the only state in the union in which playing a vital role in the election process does not necessarily involve giving your party members a chance to vote.

HEADLINE: Snubbed by the West, Tudjman Receives a Posthumous Rebuke

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: ZAGREB, Croatia, Dec. 13

 BODY:
Croatia's first president, Franjo Tudjman, was buried today in a somber ceremony, mourned by tens of thousands of the Croats to whom he helped deliver independence and by a less-than-stellar panoply of foreign dignitaries.
Thousands lined the streets as the funeral cortege passed. The ceremony, which had a military cast, was capped by a Roman Catholic service for this onetime Communist general in Tito's Yugoslavia. 
 But given Mr. Tudjman's authoritarian rule and his reluctance to cooperate with the United Nations' tribunal on war crimes in the former Yugoslavia, the level of representation here by foreign countries was noticeably low. The few heads of state present included President Suleyman Demirel of Turkey and the Croatian member of Bosnia's three-member presidency, Ante Jelavic, and there were heads of government from Hungary, Macedonia, Slovenia and Montenegro.
Western countries generally sent lower-level diplomats, or -- like the United States -- were represented only by their ambassadors.
This calculated snub could backfire in the coming parliamentary and presidential elections and help Mr. Tudjman's party, the Croatian Democratic Union, or H.D.Z., warned Davor Butkovic, a political analyst writing in the daily newspaper Jutarnji List. "Such a demonstration of distaste for Tudjman will not only strengthen and unite the voting base of the H.D.Z., which is anti-European anyway, but may seriously affect those who are still undecided," he wrote.
Mr. Tudjman's death and the parliamentary elections planned for Jan. 3, which a six-party opposition coalition is expected to win, are likely to set Croatia in a more Western-oriented, democratic direction.
Jadranko Crnic, the chairman of the Constitutional Court until a week ago, said it was not proper to criticize Mr. Tudjman too harshly so soon after his death.
"But Croatia needs to move in a more democratic direction," said Mr. Crnic. "Everyone in every political party should accept the idea that there should never again be a president with as much power as he had under the current Constitution. Everyone should agree that power should flow from the Parliament."
A new president should be selected within 60 days, according to the Constitution. The opposition, led by the Social Democratic leader, Ivica Racan, and the Social Liberal leader, Drazen Budisa, has promised better cooperation with the war crimes tribunal and is openly supported by the United States.
The new government will inherit an economic recession, high unemployment and taxes, bloated state industries and a large national debt, requiring painful political choices to turn the economy around.

To the Editor:
Re "Caught in U.S. Civil War" (Op-Ed, Dec. 13):
Norbert Walter's argument for limiting the debate over the legitimacy of the World Trade Organization to the United States domestic stage falls short of the mark. 
 Only a fraction of those who are opposed to the W.T.O. are motivated primarily by fears that globalization will threaten job security in the United States. Others oppose the W.T.O. because they believe that the organization erodes democracy in the United States and abroad by robbing congressional and parliamentary bodies of their legislative powers and placing the final authority for determining which laws shall be adhered to in the hands of a global body of unelected delegates.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Expectations Of Rate Rise Cause Decline In Treasuries

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Bond prices fell yesterday on expectations that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates early next year, even if a consumer price report today shows that inflation is not accelerating.
"You've got to assume bonds are going to struggle in anticipation" of higher Fed rates, said Roger Early, who manages $2.5 billion of debt at Delaware Investments in Philadelphia. "The Fed is likely to move in the first quarter." 
 The price of the 30-year bond fell 16/32 , to 99, after Cathy E. Minehan, the president of the Boston Fed, warned that economic growth might be too strong. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.20 percent from 6.16 percent on Friday.
Treasuries pared gains made on Friday, when yields fell after the government said producer prices excluding food and energy were unchanged last month. The Consumer Price Index may not be as benign. Analysts expect that it rose two-tenths of 1 percent last month.
"We've got a really important number tomorrow," said William Lloyd, head of market strategy at Barclays Capital. A higher-than-expected number might send bonds tumbling, he said, while a low reading might not do much to allay concerns about a future rate increase.
It may only be a matter of time before the booming economy fuels inflation, analysts said. Strong holiday sales suggest fourth-quarter growth could rival the 4.3 percent annual pace of the third quarter.
That may be too strong, said Ms. Minehan. "There is a case to be made that the economy has been growing beyond what is sustainable," she said. "What we haven't yet seen is the pickup in inflation that would usually accompany such an extended period of high growth and resource utilization."
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Transit Strike Threat

 BODY:
With a possible transit strike looming after midnight tonight, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is warning that a walkout would be disastrous for New York City's residents and its economy. Strictly speaking, Mr. Giuliani is a bystander in the labor negotiations between the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, a state agency, and the transit union. But the mayor is right to step in and assert the city's interest in a deal. As he notes, a strike would be illegal under the state's Taylor Law, and it is irresponsible of the union to speak casually about walking off the job in the absence of a contract. Patient negotiating will be a more effective tactic for bus and subway workers seeking better wages.
The latest reports suggest some progress has been made toward bridging the differences between the M.T.A. and Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union. They started far apart, however. The union demanded a wage increase of 27 percent over three years, while the M.T.A. offered 9.5 percent over four years. But since the M.T.A. agreed to a four-year, 13 percent increase for workers on the commuter railroads, it may find it hard not to offer the same package to subway and bus workers in the city. 
 The transit workers say they deserve generous raises because an increase in subway and bus riders has expanded the authority's revenues. But the extra revenues are needed to help finance the agency's ambitious capital improvement program over the next five years. One rule of thumb can give management some flexibility, however. If workers are willing to increase their productivity through staffing changes and greater flexibility in assignments, the agency should be willing to share some of the savings in the form of increased wages.
The main problem in the current talks is that the union has been split by bitter internal battles in recent years. Its president, Willie James, barely won re-election a year ago, and a militant faction known as New Directions has demanded and won a place at the bargaining table. Mr. Giuliani says this group is responsible for misleading members into thinking that a strike would not necessarily be illegal, and would actually help their cause. In reality, a strike could destroy the union's finances.
By definition there is no good time for a transit strike. But at the height of a holiday season, and with a millennium New Year's celebration approaching, a strike right now would be especially destructive. In most public employee unions, and indeed most private unions, there is a tradition that talks can continue without a contract, while wages and benefits continue at the current level. Both sides should pledge immediately that if the deadline passes without a contract at midnight tonight, they will keep talking and bring in an outside mediator if necessary to avert a strike. Millions of New Yorkers are counting on them to behave responsibly.

HEADLINE: With Berger in Catbird Seat, Albright's Star Dims

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 13

 BODY:
The end of the war in Kosovo was supposed to be a moment of glory for Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, who had argued passionately for the fight.
Instead, in the six months since, Dr. Albright has been effectively eclipsed in foreign affairs by Samuel R. Berger, the national security adviser, who has brought his physical proximity to the Oval Office and his personal relationship with President Clinton to bear on every foreign policy issue, according to administration officials and foreign policy experts. 
 From forging China's entry into the World Trade Organization, to the unsuccessful battle to win the Senate's approval of the nuclear test ban treaty, to shaping American policy toward Russia's war in Chechnya, to running President Clinton's 11-day trip to Europe, Mr. Berger's presence has been unrelenting.
Nobody would argue that Dr. Albright has been locked out. The secretary was at center stage in the Middle East last week when the Syrian president, Hafez al-Assad, told her during their meeting in Damascus that he was prepared to resume negotiations with Israel. Her assistants were quick to note that Mr. Assad had told a visitor the week before that "nothing can happen until the lady comes."
The Israeli-Syrian breakthrough was announced by President Clinton, but Dr. Albright was in the spotlight explaining the deal on television, even though she is less a fixture on the talk shows than she once was.
Despite what will be continued visibility for Dr. Albright this week as the Middle East peace talks resume in Washington, officials inside and outside the administration say there is little doubt about who actually formulates the decisions.
"There is no dispute who runs the show on foreign policy," said Ivo Daalder, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, who is working on a study of the national security council, and who worked with Mr. Berger in the first Clinton term.
Of Dr. Albright, he said: "She remains a participant in the process. But her weight as secretary of state in the determination of foreign policy appears less than at any time in the Clinton administration, including Secretary of State Warren Christopher's term."
Mr. Berger, a trade lawyer by profession and longtime Washington political insider, has emerged on top not because of his expertise in foreign policy, said Mr. Daalder.
Rather, what helped him rise so forcefully are his skills as a hands-on manager, his obsession with finding a consensus among top officials and the fact that, in this administration, foreign policy has often been redefined as economic policy advanced through increased trade.
Administration officials say Mr. Berger emerged the much stronger of the pair from the Kosovo war.
Dr. Albright, who is seen as a policy maker driven by convictions with a large human rights concern, convinced Mr. Berger and Mr. Clinton of the need to go to war against the Yugoslav leader, Slobodan Milosevic, many officials have said. It was a position that the president and Mr. Berger came to much later and more warily than the secretary.
But once the war began, the White House became the center of operations, a place that Dr. Albright visited for meetings but where Mr. Clinton and Mr. Berger held the fort. For the most part, her task was to work the phones from the State Department to try to keep the NATO foreign ministers on board and fully briefed.
The administration's foreign policy emphasis then shifted away from Dr. Albright's strengths -- the Balkans and Europe -- to China, Russia, the Middle East and Ireland -- where a special envoy, George Mitchell, reported to Mr. Berger and the president.
At the same time, Mr. Berger was being reinforced by a bigger and more operational National Security Council than ever before. There are currently 99 policy assistants at the council (35 on loan from nongovernmental institutions like the Council on Foreign Relations), many of them micromanaging issues. A decade ago, there were about 70.
On Mr. Clinton's recent trip to Istanbul for a meeting of the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe, where Russia was the major topic, Mr. Berger briefed reporters every day, a job often done by the White House spokesman.
On Russia policy in general, Dr. Albright's deputy undersecretary of state, Strobe Talbott, is the key policy maker, with Mr. Berger increasingly involved, officials said.
Mr. Talbott, who is the administration's most frequent traveler to Moscow, writes long memos that are delivered to Dr. Albright and Mr. Berger "concurrently and equally," an administration official said. The issues are then resolved at the White House, the official said.
The secretary talks frequently with the Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, but Mr. Ivanov, according to administration officials, is not part of the inner workings of the Russian government.
On China, Mr. Berger has taken the lead, a situation that Dr. Albright has said she believes is a traditional one for the White House.
When China's entry into the World Trade Organization needed to be pushed, Dr. Albright said it was natural that the United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, should be in charge.
"She's fantastic," Dr. Albright said. "She has every detail in her head; that is her job."
On the fight with Congress over the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, Mr. Berger was in the catbird seat. He gave the Democratic leadership the go-ahead to try to win approval and then negotiated -- unsuccessfully -- with Republican leaders. Neither Dr. Albright's warm relationship with the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Jesse Helms -- a friendship she has taken great pride in -- nor Mr. Berger's political instincts helped.
The treaty's defeat was a major setback for the administration, and Mr. Berger tried a comeback with two speeches that lambasted what he called the dangers to the United States of neo-isolationism. But after receiving poor reviews from the foreign policy establishment on the grounds that he had been too partisan, Mr. Berger dropped the theme.
Dr. Albright had not been given an advance copy of Mr. Berger's first speech, to the Council on Foreign Relations, State Department officials said. In the interview, she said crisply: "I write my speeches and Mr. Berger writes his speeches."
Mr. Berger is not the most powerful national security adviser in recent history -- a status that that still belong to Henry Kissinger followed by Zbigniew Brzezinski. But he is surely the most political adviser.
"He instinctively understands Mr. Clinton's needs better than anyone else," Mr. Daalder said. "That makes him absolutely the best national security adviser for this president, whose involvement in foreign affairs is episodic and often driven by domestic political considerations."
Mr. Berger and Dr. Albright, who know each other well from Democratic presidential campaigns and Washington salons, insist that they work together in seamless coordination.
In an interview in his office, Mr. Berger said he and the secretary "work together as a team as well as any foreign policy team in the last 25 years."
He is, however, sensitive about their relative positions. He took care to read in advance a State Department transcript of an interview that Dr. Albright had given to The New York Times a week earlier, in which a question suggested that Mr. Berger had assumed some of the mantle of secretary of state -- a notion that Mr. Berger hotly disputed.
For her part, Dr. Albright said, "As far as I am concerned a strong national security adviser is very important for a strong secretary of state."
In some respects, the emphasis on teamwork is not misplaced, said Coit Blacker, who was the senior assistant on Russia on the National Security Council in Mr. Clinton's first term and is now a professor of international relations at Stanford.
Mr. Berger had overtaken Dr. Albright because his personality suited the president, and Dr. Albright appeared to have left a vacuum. It is Mr. Berger who has the ease of access to President Clinton, an ultimate measure of clout in any administration.
When pressed in an interview how often she had seen President Clinton one-on-one this year, Dr. Albright replied: "I do not keep track of it but often what happens is that I see him alone or after a meeting or I talk to him on the phone. He calls me or I call him."

HEADLINE: Translating S.U.V. Into European;
Re-engineering The Old World

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: PARIS, Dec.13

 BODY:
A typical ad for a Hyundai Galloper reads like a zoology text: "Strong and Savage, Lives in Cities."
Hyundai Motor and other automakers have introduced such ads to persuade Europeans to buy an unlikely animal, a native of North America that has been bred successfully in East Asia and is now spreading to the narrow lanes and congested cities of Western Europe: the sport utility vehicle. 
 Astronomical gas prices and a tradition of compact cars would seem to make most of Europe less hospitable than the United States to sport utilities. Yet Europeans -- to the delight of auto industry executives but to the dismay of environmentalists and traffic planners -- are taking to the vehicles in a big way, moving up from their midget Fiat Cinquecentos and Renault Twingos.
To be sure, many of the models sold in Europe, sometimes modified versions of their trans-Atlantic kin, are smaller and more fuel-efficient than the behemoths found on American roads. But some larger models are also attracting buyers.
After several years of relative stability, European sales of the high-riding sport utilities surged 26 percent last year, four times the rate of the overall passenger vehicle market, to 464,400. This year, they are expected to grow another 21 percent, to roughly 564,200, again four times the pace of the overall market.
Still, that number represents only about 3.7 percent of the total number of new passenger vehicles registered, far lower than in the United States, where last year sport utilities made up 16 percent of the market. The growth in Europe last year and this year was fueled by the introduction of new models like the Land Rover Freelander, the new Honda HR-V and the General Motors Corporation's updated Frontera from its Opel division, all smaller than the standard sport utility and hence better attuned to European roads. And with virtually every major manufacturer preparing an entry or already selling one, Europe's flirtation with sport utilities is expected to continue.
"There is still latent demand in Western Europe for this thing," said Nigel Griffith, an analyst at Standard & Poor's DRI in London. "There are still cowboys out there."
Last year, General Motors replaced its old Frontera, which was essentially an Isuzu Rodeo for the European market, and sold 25,000 of the new model. This year, it expects to sell 37,000 Fronteras, which are built at a factory in Britain. In just the first eight months of this year, Honda Motor sold more than 17,000 HR-V's, its new sporty, two-door hatchback similar to the CR-V in the United States, lifting its total European sales of sport utility vehicles to more than 41,000 -- almost as many as it sold in Europe in all of last year. And Land Rover, part of the BMW-owned Rover Group, sold more than 40,000 Freelanders last year, the model's first year.
Encouraged by such successes, Fiat Auto announced this summer that it would invest $122 million in a joint venture with Mitsubishi Motors to build a sport utility at a factory outside Turin, Italy. Renault of France says that early next year it will introduce a utility, its first since bowing out of Jeep 12 years ago when it sold its controlling stake in American Motors to Chrysler. And Ford Motor is planning a downsized sport utility vehicle next year that will be more fuel efficient than the Explorer, its smallest model now, in part to meet the mounting European competition.
Then there are the offerings for the more pampered European motorists. The Mercedes-Benz unit of DaimlerChrysler had such success in Europe with its M-class utility, which is assembled in Alabama mainly for the North American market, that it started production of the M-class in July at a factory in Graz, Austria. In Italy, Mitsubishi is manufacturing the Pajero Pinin, an upscale model that it developed with the Italian design house Pininfarina. BMW has decided to introduce a European version of its new luxury X5, which goes on sale in the United States in December.
To outdo them all, Volkswagen plans to trot out its first two sport utilities by 2002. One, a midprice Volkswagen, will be built at a factory in Slovakia, while a more expensive version that is part of a joint venture with Porsche will be assembled at the same factory, then outfitted with a fancy Porsche interior and a more powerful engine at a factory Porsche is building in Leipzig, Germany.
Because European roads are smaller than those in the United States and gas prices are higher, automakers have bred a miniature species of sport utilities for Europe. Honda's new two-door HR-V, for instance, at 13 feet 6 inches, is 28 inches shorter than the Ford Explorer.
Utilities imported from the United States are trimmed to meet European tastes and requirements. Chrysler, which imports the Wrangler and the Cherokee from the United States, and assembles the Grand Cherokee at the factory in Austria where Mercedes makes the M-class, builds different seats and a stiffer suspension into its European cars and installs wipers and lights that conform to European standards.
Because of high gas prices (in Italy, for example, unleaded gas can cost more than $4.50 a gallon), many sport utility vehicles in Europe have diesel engines, since diesel fuel is cheaper. And most European utilities have four-cylinder engines, which use less gas than the V6 or big V8 engines in comparable American models.
In the United States, the sport utility was dreamed up by American automakers as essentially a pickup truck with a roof over the bed and extra rows of seats, and then successfully copied by Japanese manufacturers. In Europe, by contrast, it was first popularized by the Japanese -- who created the market by introducing smaller, more economical utilities they had designed for congested Asian cities -- and then copied by other automakers.
"The Japanese created the market from scratch," said Daniel T. Jones, a professor of auto industry management at the Cardiff University business school in Wales. "And everyone piled in behind the Japanese."
European automakers like the S.U.V. for the same reason their American counterparts do: fat cars make fat profits. Yet the growing competition in Europe, as more and more models flood the market, has depressed profit margins below those in the United States. Moreover, small production runs, usually of 30,000 to 40,000 vehicles, prevent the economies of scale that benefit manufacturers in the United States, where runs are often five to six times that size.
To keep costs down, Professor Jones said, the Europeans often share development costs with partners and borrow equipment from existing models. Thus, the platform for Renault's new sport utility will be adapted from its highly successful Scenic line of cars. The mechanical equipment for Fiat's new entry will come from Mitsubishi.
Even so, the automakers charge far higher prices in Europe for the same models they sell in the United States. A Chrysler Grand Cherokee, for instance, sells for up to 300,000 francs in France, or more than $46,000, compared with about $35,000 in the United States. The manufacturers explain the difference by citing transportation costs, European taxes and the expense of outfitting the cars to meet European standards. European consumers do not seem discouraged from buying.
Indeed, so many luxury automakers are rushing into the market that a new category of high-priced, high-performance sport utility vehicle is emerging -- populated with the likes of BMW's X5, Mercedes-Benz's M-class and Porsche's planned offering -- that is blurring the very definition of a utility. Thomas Zauber, a BMW spokesman in Munich, emphasized that "we don't say sport utility vehicle, we say sport activity vehicle, as opposed to off-road varieties." BMW, he said, believes that "the market is beginning to differentiate, and we believe it's going to grow in Europe."
Increasingly, Mr. Griffith of DRI said, "the market is about a statement of self-image, what people want to project to other people, and not just about moving from point A to point B."
Whatever you call the vehicles, more and more Europeans are buying them, and for much the same reasons as their Americans counterparts.
"You've got maximum safety, even if going off road to pick mushrooms," said Mario Roccabella, who drives a Suzuki Vitara, a small utility. Indeed, Mr. Roccabella, a 48-year-old auto salesman in Rome, got so hooked on his own vehicle several years ago that he began selling several brands, including Land Rovers, Mitsubishis and Subarus, and now organizes rallies for S.U.V. owners. Even in labyrinthine Rome, he said, sport utilities abound, offering greater vision because of their height, and a relatively smooth ride "even though the streets are made of Swiss cheese."
Environmental objections to the vehicles have not yet arisen, and some countries, like Italy -- now one of the hottest markets -- have even abolished taxes they once levied on off-road vehicles to discourage their spread, under pressure from automakers as well as constituents.
Some automakers and environmentalists cite the relatively low market share of sport utility vehicles, their smaller size in Europe and greater fuel efficiency as reasons an environmental debate has not erupted in Europe.
Still, some European motorists are already griping about sport utility drivers who hog the road in extremely congested cities.
"I don't like it very much the way they look down at you from so high up," said Ann-Henri Le Gouvello, 55, who owns a soup company in Rambouillet, France, and who uses a four-door Mercedes-Benz 300GE -- hardly a subcompact -- to drive to Paris or go hunting near his Rambouillet home. He sniffed at what he deemed pretentious city dwellers in their showy all-wheel drive vehicles, saying, "They use them to drive only in the city, and they never leave the road with them."
And despite fears that too many of the vehicles are on the drawing board, the automakers are accelerating their plans, pointing not only to growth in Europe but the potential for export.
Dave Reuter, a spokesman for Ford Europe, said its new, smaller model was designed for North America, Europe and Asia. Volkswagen expects to sell some of its new Volkswagen and Porsche utilities abroad; roughly half the 20,000 Porsches it will build will be sold in the United States.
"They never would have done it just for Europe," Mr. Griffith of Standard & Poor's said.

HEADLINE: Xerox Shares Shake Off Friday's Jitters

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
As shares of the Xerox Corporation regained a modicum of what they lost late Friday, a market truism was reaffirmed yesterday: investors are simply contrarians these days.
Right after the market closed on Friday, Xerox dropped a bombshell, warning that fourth-quarter earnings, which it had already said in October would be poor, would be even worse than that. Xerox's shares continued to fall in after-hours trading after closing at $20.0625, down 14 percent. 
 Yesterday, analysts flooded First Call/Thomson Financial with downgrades. They reduced their estimates for Xerox's fourth-quarter earnings to 40 cents from 66 cents, and they lowered their estimates for next year's earnings to $1.91 from $2.29.
"They went from estimating a 3 percent rise in earnings next year to a 3 percent decline," said Charles L. Hill, director of research at First Call. "Clearly, the analysts see some long-lasting problems at Xerox."
Yet neither Xerox nor investors were acting as though the company was in serious trouble yesterday. Conventional wisdom normally dictates that a company fight an upstart competitor by dropping prices. Although Xerox has been steadily losing market share to Canon, which has introduced many new digital products this year, Xerox announced price increases yesterday of 3 percent to 5 percent on some of its highest-end and lowest-end digital products.
"These are products where we can still sell everything we build, and that makes a price increase sustainable," said Jeffrey J. Simek, a Xerox spokesman.
Investors, despite their reaction late Friday, had calmed down by yesterday. Instead of plunging further in response to the analysts' downgrades, Xerox's shares rose $1.0625, to $21.125.
"Xerox has a tremendous customer base, and those customers will give them time to get their act together before they switch to competitors," said Hadley Reynolds, director of research for the Delphi Group, a document processing industry consulting firm in Boston.
It was unclear yesterday whether investors were simply bargain hunting or whether they agree with Mr. Reynolds rosy prognosis. If it is the latter, it is based more on hope than on tangible signs of improvement.
Many of Xerox's problems are beyond its control, of course. Brazil, once Xerox's hottest growth market, has serious economic trouble. And the strong dollar has damped the numbers Xerox can report from still-healthy sales in Europe.
But it is in the United States that Xerox is suffering the most. It still derives 75 percent of sales from slow, low-margin copiers whose markets grow less than 10 percent a year. Sales remain disappointing for Xerox's most profitable product line, the high-speed copiers used by publishing houses for print-on-demand applications and by corporations in their central copier operations.
Xerox attributes the shortfall to jitters over potential Year 2000 computer problems. But if that were the case, both the company and analysts would be predicting a big bounce from pent-up demand during the second quarter of 2000. No one is making such predictions.
Nor does Year 2000 seem to be an industrywide problem. Canon USA, which is emerging as Xerox's hottest competitor for high-speed digital copiers, insists its sales continue to boom. To be fair, Canon does not yet offer the kind of superexpensive high-speed copiers that Xerox says were the hardest hit by Year 2000 problems. But, the company intends to offer its first 110 page-a-minute digital copier in January, which means it will be approaching potential customers just as their Year 2000 fears are abating.
"If companies really are holding back on purchases because of Y2K, then we're going to have one real blowout first quarter," said Timothy Andree, a Canon vice president. Six months ago, Canon was ranked fourth in the copier industry, behind Xerox, Ricoh and Sharp. Now, many analysts say Canon may well end the year as No. 1.
"The hottest products win the day, and Canon's products are the hottest right now," said Benjamin A. Reitzes, an analyst at PaineWebber.
Xerox's sales people are in poor shape to fight back. They are grappling with a reorganization, effective in January, that makes them responsible for specific industries and companies, not geographic territories. On top of that, Xerox recently cut its administrative staff, figuring that it could easily consolidate 36 administrative centers into three.
The result was chaos. Billing errors and uncollected receivables skyrocketed, and sales people spent their time placating angry customers instead of cultivating new ones.
"They've bungled this entire restructuring at a time when there are just too many copier companies chasing too little business," Mr. Reitzes said.
Still, Xerox has not lost all its fans. Gibboney Huske, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston, is sticking with her buy recommendation on Xerox stock. In fact, she predicts the share price will hit $41 within the next 18 months.
"Xerox is still a good buy from the perspective of risk-return," she said. "Granted, in the last month you've seen all the risk and none of the return, but ultimately these are short-term issues that will be resolved."
Mr. Simek said that Xerox already had a senior management task force working on "more than 25 countermeasures to help us heal more quickly and sustain earnings growth." For now, Mr. Simek offers no details, other than to say the countermeasures range from generating demand to reducing costs. He promised greater detail on Jan. 25, when Xerox will announce its fourth-quarter earnings.

HEADLINE: Race, Class and Now Money Fueling Rent-to-Own Battle

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Dec. 13

 BODY:
In many poor communities, rent-to-own furniture outlets often stir the same mixed emotions as utility companies: both businesses provide necessities, but their steep prices often breed resentment.
So it is little wonder that the industry's annual efforts to win favorable legislation from the New Jersey Legislature often involve the inflammatory issues of race and class. This year's battle, over a bill that would exempt rent-to-own businesses from the state's laws limiting interest rates on lending, has also been fueled by big money. And as lawmakers rush to finish their business before the end of the legislative session on Jan. 10, it has become one of Trenton's most bitterly contested issues. 
 Rent-to-own advocates, who say their high prices are necessary because they provide a costly service for a market no other businesses will enter, have given tens of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions in the last two years and spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on lobbying. They hired three of Trenton's most powerful lobbying firms to sway legislators.
Rent-to-own dealers also set off a split in the state's National Association for the Advancement of Colored People by hiring its former public affairs director to lobby for the bill.
After a squabble among civil rights leaders and heated debates between members of the Black and Latino Caucus, opponents of the bill managed today to prevent the measure from coming up for a vote. But supporters of the bill say they may mount one last charge to push the measure through both the Assembly and the State Senate on the day of the final voting session, so the battle may not be over.
Industry officials say the New Jersey proposal, which is similar to New York State's law, is actually a consumer protection measure because it would mandate that rent-to-own dealers disclose the total cost of an item on every price tag. The bill would allow customers to use their rent-to-own records as a credit reference, but would forbid the companies to file negative credit reports against those who failed to pay.
But consumer advocates oppose the bill because it would shield rent-to-own dealers from lawsuits by making it legal for them to charge up to 200 percent of the retail price of a piece of furniture before customers would gain ownership. In the past three years, the industry has lost or settled several costly class-action suits charging violations of the state's consumer fraud laws, and in one case a Passaic County judge criticized the shops for charging "unconscionably" high rates.
Consumer groups have asked to limit the purchase price on rent-to-own items to 130 percent. Advocacy groups say that in poor neighborhoods, where many residents do not have the financial wherewithal to get credit cards, there is little choice but to patronize rent-to-own shops. Curtis Fisher, executive director of New Jersey Public Interest Research Group, said his organization's survey found that rent-to-own businesses charged annual interest rates of 125 percent for a 14-cubic-foot refrigerator, and as high as 200 percent.
"The practice of charging too much for a piece of merchandise isn't capitalism," said Assemblywoman Loretta Weinberg, a Bergen County Democrat. "It's loan sharking."
In the past, those arguments helped opponents of rent-to-own legislation prevail over their better-financed, better-organized foes. But during this legislative session, which began in January 1998, rent-to-own businesses have given more than $40,000 to political candidates from both parties, state records show.
The industry also spent more than $80,000 on lobbying firms in 1997 and $220,000 in 1998, a study by the New Jersey Public Interest Research Group shows.
The most controversial move in the industry's campaign was the decision to hire Walter Fields, the former N.A.A.C.P. political action director. He helped win the endorsement of the Black Ministers' Council of New Jersey and its director, the Rev. Reginald T. Jackson, New Jersey's most prominent civil rights leader.
Late last week, Mr. Fields also used his influence within the State N.A.A.C.P. to persuade the group's newly elected director to issue a letter dropping the group's longstanding opposition to the bill. But at the group's quarterly meeting last weekend, N.A.A.C.P. members overruled their director and voted to renew their opposition to the bill. Some members also criticized Mr. Fields for working for an industry that is mistrusted in many black neighborhoods. "It's unfortunate that people have to racialize this," said Mr. Fields, who is black. "And it's just wrong for people to think that every black person should have a preprogrammed position on this issue."
By today, the N.A.A.C.P.'s actions persuaded Craig Stanley, one of the Democratic co-sponsors, to withdraw his support for the bill unless certain amendments were added. Assemblyman Joseph Charles, director of the Black and Latino Caucus, said that a heated discussion among his members also swayed two Democrats who had briefly considered supporting the bill.
Republican sponsors of the bill, who needed three Democratic votes, suddenly found they had none, and were forced to withdraw it. But Dale Florio, an industry lobbyist, said the fight had not ended. "Until the session ends, there's always a possibility," he said. "So if you're asking if we've given up, the answer is no."

The Path to Untold Riches Branches Off Wall Street
For the first time since Wall Street became the surest professional path to riches during the frenzied 1980's, those with the biggest paydays are not investment bankers but former investment bankers. 
 One-time masters of the universe say banking has become prosaic, with the heavy demands no longer producing unrivaled rewards. Many are leaving to join online start-ups, technology companies and venture capital firms -- the pillars of the new economy. Page A1.
 
Computer Consultant to Buy USWeb
Whittman-Hart, a computer consulting company, said that it had agreed to acquire USWeb/CKS, a company specializing in Internet design and marketing strategy, in a stock swap valued at about $5.87 billion. The two companies said they would create the largest Internet professional-services concern in the world. But Wall Street reacted negatively to the deal, sending the stock of both companies plummeting. Shares of Whittman-Hart closed at $54.50, down $24.5625, or 31 percent. Shares in USWeb also fell, closing at $43.8125, down $7.0625, or 13.9 percent. C2.
 
Nasdaq Sets 7th Record This Month
Technology stocks continued to power ahead, pulling the Nasdaq composite index to its seventh record this month. The Nasdaq composite climbed 37.93 points, or just more than 1 percent, to 3,658.17. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 32.11 points, or 0.3 percent, to 11,192.59, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index also slipped, but by a more modest 1.82 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,415.22. C13.
 
Bond prices fell on expectations that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates early next year. The yield of the 30-year issue rose to 6.20 percent from 6.16 percent. C13.
 
Despite Warning, Xerox Shares Rise
Despite Xerox's announcement on Friday that its fourth-quarter earnings would fall short of expectations and subsequent downgrades by analysts, neither Xerox nor investors were acting as though the company was in serious trouble. Shares rose $1.0625, to $21.125. C2.
 
G.M. May Help Pay Nazi Victims
The German subsidiary of General Motors said that it would probably contribute to a fund to compensate forced laborers during the Nazi era, a move that could make the carmaker the first American company to accept responsibility for those abuses. A3.
 
NTL Continues Cable Buying Spree
NTL, a six-year-old telecommunications company based in New York that operates mainly in Britain, expanded its foothold on the Continent with a $3.7 billion agreement to buy Cablecom Group, Switzerland's leading cable television operator. NTL's chief executive, Barclay Knapp, has pursued a strategy that combines bundling telephone service, cable television and Internet access into a single service much as AT&T has sought to do. C4.
 
ING Withdraws French Bank Bid
Shares in Credit Commercial de France surged 5 percent after ING Groep, the biggest Dutch financial services group, first made and then withdrew a $10 billion takeover bid. Analysts said they expected ING to continue to pursue the bank. C4.
 
Hundreds Protest Altered Food
As the Food and Drug Administration held the last of its three public hearings on bio-engineered food, hundreds of protesters staged what organizers said was the largest rally ever in the United States against the use of genetic engineering in food. A25.

HEADLINE: Security Council Backs Off Again on Vote on Inspections for Iraq

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 13

 BODY:
The Security Council backed away today from a vote that had been planned on a new arms-inspection system for Iraq. Diplomats said foreign ministers of the five permanent council members were continuing to confer by telephone in hope of broadening support for the resolution.
The vote to create a new disarmament commission for Iraq and a new program for the Iraqis to follow that would lead to a suspension of nine years of sanctions had been tentatively planned for Friday, then Saturday and then today. Action is now possible on Tuesday. But that is also not certain. 
 Diplomats seemed in the dark about exactly what was being discussed at a higher level, because it was fairly clear that of the five veto-bearing permanent members of the 15-member council, Britain and the United States would vote for the measure and that Russia and China were widely thought likely to abstain. Some diplomats said the delay was intended to give more time to efforts to persuade Russia to vote yes.
France, which appeared last week ready to support the resolution, seems to be moving toward abstention, diplomats said.
Iraq has put pressure on Russia and France, traditional business partners, to stop the move toward new inspections, and France's hesitation may reflect its desire not to leave itself exposed in Iraq by breaking ranks with Russia. The French have talked the most in recent weeks about holding out for the broadest consensus. Its representative here, Alain Dejammet, said France had proposed changes in the resolution to help the Russians support it.
The Iraqis argue that they have met all the requirements for a lifting of economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations after the invasion of Kuwait in 1990 and would agree to international monitoring only after the embargo had vanished. The resolution before the council would lift the limit on Iraqi oil sales immediately and make import procedures easier. But it would also keep controls on how Iraq spends its money until it had met certain requirements to be framed by a new inspection team.
Russia says that this is too vague a goal line for Iraq and would like to have tasks spelled out in advance. Under a resolution after the gulf war in 1991, Iraq was required to destroy all its weapons of mass destruction and the means to make new ones. Much of its arsenal was eliminated. But questions remain about biological weapons, which Iraq at first denied having, and nuclear programs, which inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency found to be more advanced than they had expected. Fears that both those programs have continued run high among disarmament experts.
Today, there were reports that Iraqi was refusing to issue visas for inspectors from the atomic energy agency to make a routine visit, required by agreements on nuclear nonproliferation that predate the gulf war.
Some Arab diplomats, watching the yearlong effort to try to replace an inspection system that ended with British and American air strikes against Iraq last December, question whether the United States really wants effective monitoring in Iraq, which would make independent American military action more complicated, or whether Washington is backing the new plan in the full knowledge that Iraq would block it, providing a pretext for additional bombings.
Iraqi rejection of the plan would allow sanctions against Iraq to remain indefinitely or until Arab nations and more distant friends of Iraq are prepared to begin breaking the embargo. The Clinton administration appears willing to gamble that the embargo will hold, at least in the near future, while it pursues its plan to strengthen an Iraqi exile opposition in the hope of toppling President Saddam Hussein.

HEADLINE: The Union Faction That Keeps Talking Strike

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA 

 BODY:
Like many such rabble-rousing efforts, it began as a newsletter, in this case named "Hell on Wheels." Fifteen years ago its leaders waged what they now unabashedly call "propaganda campaigns" to topple their union leadership. For years, slowly and methodically, they stoked the discontent of the city's 33,000 transit workers over wages, benefits and other contract provisions, like the use of welfare recipients to do work done by union members.
That dissident band of transit workers, now called the New Directions Caucus, is wielding unusual influence over contract talks, pressing the union leadership to strike rather than accept an unsatisfactory contract. Indeed, if they have long been a thorn on the side of Willie James, the president of Local 100 of the Transit Workers Union, they have lately emerged as the force that could add bite to Mr. James's bark. 
 Yesterday, the quiet-spoken leader of the caucus, Tim Schermerhorn, 44, told reporters that union members ought to vote to strike at a membership meeting today if the contract package is not substantially better than management's last public offer. He said that he had not seen the latest details of the talks, but that at a time of economic boom in the city, a satisfactory package would have to include wage increases significantly above the cost of living, and a reversal of management's new disciplinary system and the policy allowing welfare recipients to take union jobs. The dissidents have 22 of the 46 votes on the union's executive board, which must authorize any strike by a simple majority vote; that voting bloc, along with some swing votes, could make or break any deal.
"If we don't get a contract that is just, if we don't get a contract that represents some advancement for members of the union, we should walk," Mr. Schermerhorn said at a news conference yesterday outside the Grand Hyatt Hotel, where negotiations continued between officials of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the union. "If we can't win a good contract now, we won't win ever. The economy is a primary consideration."
How many members they can persuade to vote to strike remains unclear. But the caucus does seem to have considerable support. These days, New Directions slogans can be frequently seen on transit workers' lapel pins and scrawled on the sides of subway tunnels. The mayor has even singled out New Directions in his most caustic remarks against union agitators. In the last elections, Mr. Schermerhorn, a subway motorman, narrowly lost to Mr. James.
Clearly, this is New Directions' moment, partly because this contract dispute could shift the balance of power within Local 100. Also at stake is the tenor of union-management relations for years to come. It would serve the transportation authority well to make an attractive contract offer to Mr. James. Otherwise, during the next round of talks, the authority could face far more militant union representatives, led by the New Directions crew, on the other side of the bargaining table.
Today, New Directions leaders stand to gain or lose considerably. If Mr. James delivers a promising contract package at the membership meeting today at the Manhattan Center, New Directions leaders can claim credit for holding his feet to the fire. If he does not, they can argue that he sold them out.
By contrast, if they force the union into an unsuccessful strike, Mr. Schermerhorn is likely to share the blame along with Mr. James.
"On the one hand, they've positioned themselves as militant advocates of a very good contract," observed Joshua Freeman, a history professor at Queens College. On the other hand, he said, they're not leading the negotiations. "They have responsibility without authority, and that's a pretty tough position to be in."
For his part, Mr. James has described Mr. Schermerhorn as "a publicity seeker" bent on torpedoing any progress made in contract talks.
Nor did Mr. Schermerhorn have many words of praise for Mr. James.
"Willie is coming off to the public as militant," he said with a laugh yesterday. "The ranks of Local 100 don't see him that way. They see him as a union official under pressure, and we have to keep the pressure on."
The transit workers union has had a radical thread throughout its history. And it is that legacy, particularly the militancy of the union under its longtime president and founder, Michael Quill, that Mr. Schermerhorn and the New Directions cadre are trying to invoke. "The real powers that be in the city -- business -- is planning an orgy of profit-making," he said, referring to holiday shopping and the tourism season. "They're not going to rake it in if the trains aren't running."
Mr. Schermerhorn was 9 when his father, a car maintainer, took him to the 1966 union meeting at which his father voted to strike. "The thing I was impressed with most was the power of these meetings, how the strength and self-confidence of people would infect each other," he recalled in an interview yesterday.
In his last 17 years on the job, Mr. Schermerhorn said, that strength and self-confidence are what he has sought to engender in his co-workers through New Directions.
"Whatever we get is because a strike threat was made real," Mr. Schermerhorn argued.
So will there be a strike starting tomorrow?
"I think the strike is possible, but not likely," he said, "because I think our union officials will do everything possible to prevent one."

HEADLINE: Mayan Carving to Be Returned to Guatemala

BYLINE: By JUAN FORERO 

 BODY:
A 2,000-year-old Mayan stone carving that police detectives discovered in a Brooklyn garage last month will soon be shipped back to Guatemala, where it is believed to have been plundered from a ruin, the Guatemalan consul general in New York said yesterday.
The consul, Fabiola Fuentes, said that the authorities in her country consider the carving -- a 500-pound oblong stone depicting a jaguar clutching a man -- to be priceless. Ms. Fuentes said she expected the carving to be shipped in the coming weeks to the National Museum of Anthropology and History in Guatemala City, where specialists will try to determine from which ruins the object was looted. 
 The carving, which may date back as far as 150 B.C., was found on Nov. 12 packed in a crate in a garage on Pitkin Avenue in East New York after the police received an anonymous tip. Detective Ruben Santiago of the Major Case Squad said that investigators determined that the landlord and tenants of the house knew nothing about the carving, and that no arrests were made. Detective Santiago said the theft might have been committed by a ring trafficking in stolen artifacts. "There is a problem with things being smuggled," he said. "This is not the only piece."
Ms. Fuentes said that after detectives notified her about the discovery, she sent photographs of the carving to the Ministry of Cultural Affairs in Guatemala. Although archaeologists there could not determine the artifact's precise origin, Ms. Fuentes said, they said features on the stone were very similar to other Mayan carvings found in the Guatemalan highlands.
"It is very clear that the piece is from Guatemala," Ms. Fuentes said. "They have experts, and they determined that the piece comes from Guatemala. They know with precision the characteristics of the monuments of Guatemala."
Experts familiar with Mayan artifacts say the theft was no surprise. Despite international treaties barring the export of ancient artifacts, the sale of stolen carvings and pottery from countries in Central America where the Mayans flourished has been a problem for more than 30 years.
"Most of the valuable ones have been carved up and taken away already," said Ian Graham, an archaeologist at the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology at Harvard University. In August, Mr. Graham alerted the authorities that a 1,000-year-old artifact being offered for sale by an American collector had been stolen from Guatemala years before.
For the Guatemalan authorities, putting a stop to the looting is difficult in large part because many of the richest sites are heavily forested and hard to patrol. Ms. Fuentes also said that Guatemalan officials believed the thieves worked for powerful criminal rings, possibly tied to drug smugglers.
"It's hard to establish how much we lose because there are so many small pieces taken, instruments and pottery and even monuments, like the big one that we lost," Ms. Fuentes said. "It's hard to imagine, but these people have so much logistical and economic power in order to move these pieces from the country."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL: Where Next, Bronx Bombers?;
Steinbrenner Keeps Saying He May Leave. He Hasn't. The Clock Ticks.

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

 BODY:
For the last five years, George Steinbrenner has repeatedly promised that he will soon announce where he wants the Yankees to play when the lease at Yankee Stadium runs out in 2002.
Sometimes he has said he will disclose his choice by opening day, and sometimes he has said an announcement will come at season's end. In 1997, he said he would decide whether to stay in the Bronx or to move to Manhattan or New Jersey after that year's mayoral election. The following year, he said a decision would come after the race for governor. 
But as Steinbrenner weighs his options, much of the rest of New York has come to the conclusion that he is really down to only two: staying in the Bronx in a renovated Yankee Stadium or in a new ballpark.
"The rationale for leaving the Bronx has been eliminated," said Mitchell Moss, director of the Taub Urban Research Center at New York University. "Now the question is, how do you stay in the Bronx and keep George happy?"
The possibility of building a new ballpark for the team on Manhattan's West Side has all but evaporated, as has the chance, at least for now, of shifting the team to New Jersey, many politicians, urban scholars and New York City and State officials say.
Steinbrenner, who is 69 years old, has spent much of the decade publicly bemoaning what he says are the high rate of crime in the Bronx, inadequate parking and nightmarish traffic around Yankee Stadium, and the failure of Yankee fans to turn out in sufficient numbers for home games.
But more than 3.2 million people attended games at Yankee Stadium last season, a record for the team that has won more world championships than any other. And Gov. George E. Pataki, who controls the site on the West Side that has long been considered a potential future home for the Yankees, has said unequivocally that he wants the team to remain in the Bronx.
Charles Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, the state's economic development arm, said the season attendance figures may prove decisive for Steinbrenner. "George saw the fans come out in large numbers, and all indications are that he will stay in the Bronx," he said.
Vincent Tese offered his long-term perspective, predicting that the Yankees will move to Macombs Dam Park, the city park beside Yankee Stadium, where a new ballpark might rise. Tese was chairman of the state development corporation in 1993 when Mario M. Cuomo, then the governor, first suggested the West Side to Steinbrenner. "He's tried to get into Manhattan for years," Tese said, "but that's out."
Not even Steinbrenner's most ardent ally -- Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani -- talks any longer about what had once been a pet idea: building a $1 billion enclosed stadium for the Yankees above a railroad yard on the West Side, between 30th and 33rd Streets and 10th and 12th Avenues.
Without publicly acknowledging that the Manhattan alternative was dead, the mayor demonstrated his own sense of how far the political pendulum had swung when he proposed last January to use the site for a new football stadium to lure the Jets back from New Jersey. He never mentioned any baseball use of the site when he made the surprise football proposal in his annual State of the City address.
Any lingering doubts about the mayor's intentions were erased during the early morning of Oct. 28, when he stood with Steinbrenner in the Yankees' clubhouse at the Stadium, basking in the glow of their 25th World Series victory.
"This place becomes even more hallowed ground," said the mayor, a lifelong Yankee fan. "You think about all the baseball history made in this place. It means this location becomes even more important."
Asked whether that meant the Yankees would stay put, Giuliani said, "I think they will."
 
A Bird in Hand Takes Wing
In recent months, Steinbrenner's spokesman had said the Yankees' future would be decided once the team's merger with the Nets was completed. That occurred two weeks ago. Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, declined requests for an interview, but through the spokesman he insisted that all options remained open.
The new stadium saga has spanned 12 years, time enough for Steinbrenner to hire seven managers, return from a banishment from baseball, nearly sell 70 percent of the team to Cablevision, beg the forgiveness of Yogi Berra for firing him as his manager in 1985, play postgame traffic cop to investigate jam-ups near the stadium, resuscitate Darryl Strawberry's career and win three World Series in four years.
Late in 1987, Steinbrenner and the Koch Administration announced a lease deal that would have kept the team in Yankee Stadium, which the city owns, until 2032, in return for new parking garages, luxury boxes, a Metro North station and other improvements. Nearly a year later, the agreement fell apart.
"We talked to him several times and he was ready to make a deal," said Robert Esnard, a deputy mayor under Edward I. Koch. "Then he didn't want to. He's a tough businessman."
The task of satisfying Steinbrenner and keeping the Yankees shifted from Koch to Mayor David N. Dinkins to Giuliani, upon his election in 1993, and Giuliani embraced the rail yard idea shortly after a consultant's study in 1996.
If Giuliani and Steinbrenner had hoped to make an effective case to build a revenue-rich Yankee ballpark on the West Side, that time is probably past, said several former and current city and state officials.
It was quickly branded a billion-dollar white elephant. Critics argued that a Midtown stadium would produce traffic gridlock, pollute the air and create insurmountable parking problems.
The idea was embraced and deemed easy to finance by Giuliani, even before he had fully consulted with city and state officials -- or even with Steinbrenner himself. The mayor, who said his personal preference was for the Yankees to remain in the Bronx, promoted the West Side as a way of keeping Steinbrenner from taking the team out of New York City altogether.
While the notion of a Yankee Stadium in Manhattan originated with Gov. Cuomo, his successor, Pataki, wants the Yankees to stay in the Bronx; the governor controls the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which owns the rail yards.
The stadium issue turned into a political minefield last year when the City Council speaker, Peter F. Vallone, who was running for governor, tried to place a referendum on the November ballot that would have kept the city from spending money for a new stadium anywhere but in the Bronx. Aware that polls showed Vallone's referendum would be approved overwhelmingly, the mayor blocked Vallone by placing minor revisions to the City Charter on the ballot, knocking off the stadium referendum.
Steinbrenner stepped into the fray. "If you single me out," Steinbrenner warned Vallone, "you sure as hell are going to lose me."
Many elected officials say now that Steinbrenner and the mayor failed to build broad public support for the West Side plan. "I told Steinbrenner that the West Side had no chance if it's discussed in a political context," said Cuomo, who bemoans the idea's fate. "We should have spent a year developing answers to every legitimate question, then go to the public and discuss it issue by issue."
Vallone is obviously delighted with the outcome. "The cockamamie idea to go to Manhattan is dead," he said.
It is by no means clear when or how the Yankees' long-range plans will be resolved. Steinbrenner rarely talks in public about his intentions, and even the mayor is not saying much these days. Giuliani's spokeswoman declined several requests to answer questions about the stadium.
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey has pledged neither to raid New York for the Yankees nor to spend tax dollars to build a new baseball stadium.
In turn, Steinbrenner does not seem very interested in New Jersey. A year ago, Whitman said she would submit a stadium plan if an advisory panel created by Steinbrenner asked for one. No request was ever made, said Pete McDonough, a spokesman for Whitman.
The Yankees recently merged with the New Jersey Nets, and Steinbrenner's new partners, who include Raymond Chambers and Lewis Katz, are planning to build a new basketball arena in Newark with state support. It is hard to measure what influence, if any, the Nets' owners will have on the stadium decision. They have deep roots in New Jersey, but they are also committed to helping inner cities, so they might frown upon the Yankees' leaving the Bronx.
Howard Rubenstein, Steinbrenner's spokesman, insists that all options are still being weighed and says Steinbrenner is also awaiting a $3 million city-financed study on the Bronx and Manhattan sites. "We're still looking at the West Side," Rubenstein said. "It has many pluses."
 
Politics and Timing All in the Calculus
Many city and state officials suspect that Steinbrenner intends to wait everyone out to obtain the best possible deal for his team. But the risk for Steinbrenner is that he might miss his moment; some current and former government officials think he already has.
Right now, Steinbrenner is more focused on negotiating a new cable television deal for the Yankees, which would succeed a $486 million contract with the MSG Network that spans 12 years and expires after next season, according to a business associate. "He's been saying, 'This TV thing has to get done,' " the associate said.
Steinbrenner could further delay choosing his stadium site -- and perhaps try to build support for the West Side -- by exercising the first of two five-year options to extend his current Yankee Stadium lease, from 2003 to 2007.
"That's what I expect to happen," Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer said. "It doesn't achieve anything in the long term, and everyone knows it would be a dive. It just buys time for the Yankees and the city."
But time may not be on Steinbrenner's side. He might have only one more year to conclude a long-term deal with Giuliani, a cheerleader who often wears the familiar blue Yankee cap and jacket. Giuliani is expected to run for the United States Senate, and if victorious he would leave as mayor in January 2001.
"The mayor's decision to seek higher office means the stadium is no longer on the front burner," said Moss of N.Y.U. "His term is expiring before the Yankees' lease. The options have been taken from the Yankees."
Completing an expensive deal during a Senate race to keep the Yankees in the Bronx could carry political risks for Giuliani, political analysts said. But there might be some political advantage, too, because of the large Hispanic population in the Bronx, said Norman Adler, a political consultant.
If Steinbrenner defers his decision beyond the Senate election, he may lose his best chance at getting the largest possible subsidy from the city. The next mayor is very likely to be a Democrat; the field includes Ferrer, Public Advocate Mark Green and City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, among others. The successor to Giuliani, a Republican, is unlikely to be as generous with the Yankees.
"If he makes a deal with Giuliani, it will be for more than with the next mayor," former Mayor Koch said.
And there is a third risk to Steinbrenner's biding his time: the city's economy cannot stay robust forever, and a recession could turn munificent public financing for a stadium into an unaffordable luxury.
Steinbrenner's delays have slowed the Mets' plans to build a new ballpark next to Shea Stadium. The team unveiled a design for a $500 million stadium in April 1998.
But the Mets' deal has not advanced very far. "Nothing has prevented Rudy from making a deal with the Mets first," said City Councilman Walter McCaffrey, a Queens Democrat. "It might have given the city leverage with George Steinbrenner."
Fred Wilpon, co-owner of the Mets, said there had been talks with the city about financing his stadium. "But I can't answer why a deal hasn't been done," he said.
Of course, making a deal with the Yankees means offering one. According to people inside and outside government who have watched the Giuliani-Steinbrenner dance, the mayor would make an offer if only he knew what Steinbrenner really wanted.
Even Steinbrenner's friends are unsure why he has not decided. Some speculate that he has been hesitating because he does not want to be remembered as the traitor who took the Yankees out of the Bronx; others assume that by not deciding, he somehow keeps his options open.
"Once, I thought he knew what he wanted," said a friend. "Now I don't."

Japan Official Foresees Less Debt Reliance

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 13

 BODY:
The Japanese finance minister said today that he expected the government to begin trying to gradually wean the country's shaky economy away from its reliance on public borrowing, a practice that has made Japan one of the biggest debtor nations.
Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa's comments, made in an interview here, suggested that the government was keenly aware that its relentless borrowing was increasingly calling into question its fiscal responsibility, a criticism that Japan had made of the United States in years past. 
 Mr. Miyazawa is one of the nation's most powerful and best-known politicians, and his comments about government spending came against the backdrop of mild economic improvement in Japan after its worst recession since the end of World War II. The remarks may be a sign that the government is beginning to have faith that the economy's long-term prospects are improving.
Until now, officials have been wary of publicly describing the signs of life in the economy over the last year as a recovery. They have also given little indication when Japan would stop borrowing heavily to inject money into the economy, much of it to build public works projects ranging from extra tunnels and airport runways to a new Tokyo subway. Such spending has increasingly been criticized as extravagant, wasteful and unlikely to keep the economy going once the money runs out.
Mr. Miyazawa said that he had discussed the matter of a gradual, measured return to fiscal restraint with Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi on the phone this morning, and that the prime minister seemed eager to find a way to reassure the public that he was concerned about Japan's increasing indebtedness and would work to correct it as the economy regains momentum.
"Mr. Obuchi wondered how could he say it without giving up the appearance of the fight against recession," Mr. Miyazawa said. "There is some anxiety about that."
How widespread the prime minister's concerns are among the political elite here is unclear. Shizuka Kamei, chief policy official of the governing Liberal Democratic Party and leader of one of its largest factions, is an outspoken advocate of government spending to prop up the economy. Moreover, few politicians are likely to endorse any meaningful reduction in public spending before Parliament elections, which must be called by September.
Nonetheless, the Japanese deficit, already the highest in the industrial world, is expected to reach 10.7 percent of the gross domestic product by the end of this fiscal year, on March 31, 2000. The United States, by contrast, is running a surplus estimated at 1.9 percent of its gross domestic product, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the Paris-based group of rich nations.
The reversal of fortunes between the two countries is embarrassing for Japan, which criticized the United States several times in the 1980's over its budget deficit.
Mr. Miyazawa's remarks came as business executives here indicated somewhat more conviction about a recovery. A widely watched business survey by the Bank of Japan, released today, showed that corporate sentiment improved in the third quarter to its best level in two years. Still, the survey -- known as the tankan -- contained some mixed signals, notably evidence that large businesses were cutting capital spending even more than they had predicted in the second quarter. Such cutbacks reflect corporate caution about the strength of the recovery.
In a separate report suggesting that the recovery remained tenuous, the finance ministry said Japan's trade surplus fell for the ninth consecutive month, largely because of the strength of the yen. This has made Japan's products more expensive abroad, hurting the profits of major exporters ranging from Sony and Honda to Kikkoman, the world's largest producer of soy sauce.
Parliament recently approved the government's ninth expensive attempt to prod the recalcitrant economy into action -- a package of public spending, loan guarantees, tax breaks and other measures worth $171 billion if local government spending and lending are included.
That, coupled with the news that for the first time since World War II, the government will have to finance more than half of its budget through bond issues, has raised public sensitivity to the country's increasing fiscal imbalance, which has swelled total public debt to more than $5.4 trillion.
Magazines and talk shows here have been debating the value of all the spending, as well.
Mr. Miyazawa said he thought that tax receipts would start to rise, perhaps as soon as next year, after declining in five of the last six years.
"Tax revenues in the next fiscal year may go up," he said, "reflecting some improvement in the business situation as a result of the restructuring that many companies have undertaken."
The ministry's tax bureau is substantially less optimistic, though. The government's efforts to overhaul the tax system will in the short term actually reduce what it takes in.
And even though the economy has improved, corporations and individuals show little sign of increased financial well-being. Last fiscal year, corporate Japan collectively lost money for the first time since the government began gathering data on companies' performance in 1960, according to data compiled by Mikuni & Company, the country's only independent credit-rating agency.
And Mr. Miyazawa himself, one of the few voices of fiscal restraint in the top echelons of government, noted today that consumer sentiment remained uneasy. "In some ways," he said, "the anxiety is more intense now than it was at the bottom."

HEADLINE: AutoNation To Close Stores And Cut Jobs

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Dec. 13

 BODY:
In an admission of serious difficulties, AutoNation Inc. announced today that it was closing most of its used car superstores immediately and laying off their 1,800 employees, while taking a one-time charge against fourth-quarter earnings of $430 million to $490 million.
AutoNation, which has grown in just three years from a garbage disposal company to the nation's largest seller of new and used cars, also said that it would suspend further purchases of new car dealerships and concentrate instead on reducing costs at existing dealerships. 
 The company, which had hired some of the brightest consultants in the auto industry at premium salaries, has begun eliminating 225 of the 600 jobs at its corporate headquarters in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and plans to cut pay and advertising at poorly performing dealerships, said Michael J. Jackson, AutoNation's chief executive.
Because of high corporate overhead and losses at the used car superstores, AutoNation's fourth-quarter earnings will also fall considerably short of analysts' expectations, he said. In a bid to mollify Wall Street and auto dealers who sold their family businesses to the company for stock, AutoNation also announced tonight that it would buy back another $500 million of stock, in addition to the $1.2 billion worth of shares that it had already repurchased.
The company made its announcements after the close of the stock market. In after-hours trading, AutoNation's stock fell to $8.50. It had fallen 93.75 cents, to $9 at the close of regular trading. The stock had already lost more than three-quarters of its value since a peak two years ago.
Today's events were the latest in a series of setbacks at AutoNation for H. Wayne Huizenga, the company's chairman. Mr. Huizenga made his reputation by consolidating the garbage hauling and video rental industries, creating two corporate giants, Waste Management and Blockbuster. But auto retailing has proved much more difficult.
AutoNation entered the auto business by setting up used car superstores on a far grander and more lavish scale than anything the industry had ever seen. The parking lots had 1,000 or more used cars. The showrooms had computer kiosks with information on every car in the lot. The prices were prominently placed on every car, with no negotiations allowed. And there were dozens of young, college-educated sales people who worked for salaries, instead of the commissions that had long given used car salesmen an incentive for aggressive sales techniques.
But rival used car sales businesses responded by undercutting AutoNation's fixed prices. One morning two years ago, shortly after AutoNation's used car superstore in Coconut Grove, Fla., had opened for business, a well-dressed woman stood at a kiosk and furiously scribbled down prices. Asked what she was doing, she replied that she was going to take the prices to another dealership to get a better deal.
Mr. Jackson, who joined AutoNation in October after running the North American operations of Mercedes-Benz, said that the used car superstores were high-cost operations with no chance of ever generating profits proportionate to their risk. Even if AutoNation had been willing to invest heavily, devote a lot of management time and wait for years, he said, "the cost structure in those stores would still have been very high, leading to marginal operations."
AutoNation has 37 used car superstores now, but 8 of them have already become the used car portions of its new car dealerships. The company now plans to combine six more with new car dealerships and close the remaining used car superstores on Tuesday.
AutoNation's annual sales are now close to $20 billion, and the closing of the superstores will only pare that by $1 billion, Mr. Jackson said. AutoNation had previously announced that it would combine its three car rental companies -- Alamo Rent-A-Car Inc., National Car Rental System Inc. and CarTemps USA -- and spin them off as a separate company, the Auto Rental Corporation. AutoNation said today that the spinoff would be completed in January.
But the core of AutoNation's business remains: 409 new car dealerships in 19 states. They make AutoNation several times the size of any other chain of dealerships in the country. Mr. Jackson said that these operations remained strong, but that their profitability had been eroded by high costs from the company's corporate bureaucracy.
Administrative costs from levels of management above the store level were running at an annual rate of $240 million by this autumn, up 71 percent from a year earlier, Mr. Jackson said. Those costs will only be $140 million next year, he said, adding that he expected that the company's dealerships would be able to save another $30 million next year by not having to deal with so many officials and initiatives from the corporation's headquarters.
While AutoNation's new car dealerships have benefited from the industry's soaring sales this year, the used car superstores suffered from the rebates and other incentives that automakers have used this year to push sales. AutoNation specializes in late-model used cars in good condition, but the customers for such cars tend to be people who can also afford new cars.
As the price of new cars has leveled off -- and fallen sharply after allowing for inflation and improvements in car features and reliability -- prices for late-model used cars have begun falling. That hurt the used car superstores, which faced a choice of cutting prices or letting cars sit unsold.
"This was the wrong time and place to be trying to survive on late-model cars," said Chris Denove, the director of consulting services at J. D. Power and Associates.

HEADLINE: The Art of Giving, in Good Times

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Your Dec. 12 front-page article "Charity for Poor Lags Behind Need" might lead one to believe that as Americans have gotten wealthier they have gotten stingier. 
 But there is an explanation for reports by several large charities that donations have decreased, despite economic prosperity.
Americans are moving away from giving to traditional corporate-like charities toward giving in more personal ways to local, innovative and grass-roots charitable efforts. This kind of giving has several advantages. Giving to a charity that is more like a well-run small business than a large conglomerate makes it easier for the giver to know where the money is going. Moreover, giving to a grass-roots charity means that donors can come to know the people who run the charity and the effect the charity has on those it serves.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
Wall St. Is Flush With Cash But Also Green With Envy

BYLINE: This article was reported by Joseph Kahn, Laura M. Holson and Patrick McGeehan and was written by Mr. Kahn. 

 BODY:
Even by the inflated standards of high finance, Wall Street is overflowing with holiday cheer this year. Investment banks have set aside $13 billion to pay bonuses, 20 percent more than last year, with pay packages above $10 million no longer a rarity.
Yet among Wall Streeters the mood has changed. One industry veteran bemoaned the "opportunity cost" of remaining a financier in the Internet age. Others are leaving to join online start-ups, technology companies and venture capital firms, the pillars of the new economy, where they sometimes take home more than their old bosses from Day 1 -- and, they say, have more fun. 
 For the first time since Wall Street became the surest professional path to riches during the frenzied 1980's, those with the biggest paydays are former investment bankers.
Like Timothy Weller. He is the talk of the Street, but mostly because he no longer works there. Last summer, Mr. Weller, 34, left Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, where he was a middle-ranking analyst tracking the telecommunications business, to join Akamai Technologies, which provides networking services for the Internet.
Akamai, based in Cambridge, Mass., enticed him to sign on as chief financial officer by selling him 1.05 million shares, valued then at $2.63 million, and even lent him the money to buy them. Gratification was quick: when Akamai went public in October, its stock soared from $26 to $230. Mr. Weller's stake is now worth $240 million.
But that could change if the share price falls. And companies often place restrictions on when shares can be cashed in.
Few bankers will reap such gains, but many are still taking their chances on the Internet. One-time masters of the universe say banking has become prosaic, with the heavy demands no longer producing unrivaled rewards. Bankers now ogle online entrepreneurs the way lawyers and accountants once envied Wall Streeters.
"It used to be that investment bankers were at the cutting edge," said Mark Long, who as a banker for Credit Suisse First Boston helped some of America's hottest Internet companies go public. "Today, bankers are just hired guns."
During a trip last summer to promote the Internet start-up Intraware to potential investors, Mr. Long, 32, accepted his client's offer to become a vice president, joining shortly before it went public.
If Intraware does well, Mr. Long stands to earn considerably more than he did as a banker, thanks to stock options. But that is only one reason he left. "You get tired of sleeping 45 minutes a night," he said, "to sell someone else's business."
With profits for financial firms and bonuses for bankers at all-time highs, there is certainly no looming crisis on Wall Street. Even those who leave banking often do so with trepidation, fearing that inflated Internet stocks could come crashing down.
The Internet's impact has been more psychological than financial. The pressure to earn Internet windfalls shows up in little ways, as with the rising stock analyst who says he has lost bidding wars for Upper East Side apartments and adds, only half in jest, that $10 million does not buy much of a condo these days.
The online lure is also enhanced by ex-bankers who have changed careers seamlessly. Jeff Bezos worked on Wall Street until he founded Amazon.com, and that trend keeps gathering steam. Mr. Bezos, now many times a billionaire, hired a number of other former bankers and made them Internet retailers. Analysts and deal makers involved in technology, telecommunications and the Internet readily change hats and become financial officers or strategic planners at start-ups, often bringing along former colleagues.
Some defectors compete directly with their old firms. At least three new online investment banks and several Internet stock and bond trading companies, all planning to use the Internet to steal business from traditional investment banks, are led by people who learned the business from the inside.
Robert Lessin, chief executive of Wit Capital, an online investment bank, and formerly a top officer at Salomon Smith Barney, has poached a long list of bankers from Salomon, Merrill Lynch and other firms.
"It's like I'm a banker but I get to wear casual clothes," said Kate Cornish, 28, who left Salomon for Wit a few months ago.
Especially susceptible are those three to five years out of business school -- on the cusp of devoting a career to a firm, but young enough to start fresh.
"They say, 'I want to be a multimillionaire by the time I'm 30, but if I stay at Morgan Stanley, it may take me until I'm 50,' " said Joseph Perella, Morgan's head of investment banking. Americans, he added, want "instant gratification."
In reaction, Morgan Stanley has started offering stock to some newly hired bankers. BancBoston Robertson Stephens, a leading technology banking firm, has lost 10 bankers to Internet clients this year. The firm recently took 300 employees to a weekend retreat to help build esprit de corps and to aid retention, though firm officials said it was not a response to this year's attrition.
Investment bank recruiters once acted like bouncers, accepting only the best. Goldman Sachs still finds plenty of eager applicants, says Peter Kiernan, a senior partner who oversees hiring from business schools, but now, he said, "if you expect to back up a truck and load the top 10 people in a class, you're going to be disappointed."
Business school graduates think entrepreneurial jobs are the wave of the future, he said. He now tries to convince people that they can be entrepreneurs within an investment bank, which can be a tough sell. "One thing you don't do is try to sell against the Net," he said.
Not long ago, Wall Street did not have to try so hard. With the rapid growth of stocks and bonds and the explosion of mergers, securities firms were seen as controlling the levers of America's economy. Investment banking, offering top dollar, consistently ranked as the No. 1 or No. 2 career choice for top business graduates.
Popular culture followed the money. "Wall Street," the movie, and "Bonfire of the Vanities," the novel, created a stereotype of shark-like bankers and traders. In the early 1990's, investment banks were seen as the engines of globalization, financing road projects in China and privatizing phone companies in Brazil. While corporate America merged and consolidated, bankers raked in record fees.
But the Internet, like an electronic black hole, has stolen all the gravity. Securities firms seem to have less to do with creating Internet companies than they did with arranging restructurings or sending capital abroad. And through the Silicon Valley looking glass, Wall Street egos can appear almost humble.
Scott McNealy, chief executive of Sun Microsystems, wrote an Op-Ed article in The New York Times last summer extolling the value that entrepreneurs create in the economy and belittling the "nonjobs" of bankers. In "The New New Thing," Michael Lewis, who a decade ago chronicled Wall Street hubris in "Liar's Poker," portrays today's financiers as desperate grovelers who shovel money at Internet entrepreneurs in hopes of profiting from their creative instincts.
Investors seem no different. They have pumped up the stocks of Internet-friendly finance companies so much that a recent survey of the wealthiest people in finance, compiled by Institutional Investor magazine, found that the richest financiers often double as Internet entrepreneurs.
Charles Schwab, the founder, chairman and chief executive of the No. 1-ranked Internet broker, has seen his Schwab stock holdings soar to almost $5.8 billion, making him the second wealthiest person in finance after Warren E. Buffett. J. Joe Ricketts, chairman and co-chief executive of Ameritrade, the No. 7 Internet broker, has stockholdings of almost $2 billion, eclipsing the combined stockholdings of the leaders of Morgan Stanley, Merrill and Goldman.
Until recently, headhunters rarely tried to lure bankers away from Wall Street. But dot-com fever has changed that. When Priceline.com decided in June to go after an investment banker to fill a senior post at a unit it expected to take public shortly, it asked Cynthia Remec, an executive recruiter, to round up candidates the same day and set up interviews the next. Ms. Remec frantically phoned 20 bankers to fill this tall order. Within hours, to her surprise, she found 15 eager to hop the train to Stamford, Conn., Priceline's headquarters, for an interview. Priceline hired one of them, Anne Maffei, a former banker at J. P. Morgan, as a senior executive at Webhouse.com, its grocery-shopping affiliate.
Bankers and analysts on the front lines of the new economy sometimes make especially easy pickings. Though the work hours of Internet entrepreneurs are legendary, many bankers say the life compares favorably with the burden of arranging public offerings and mergers.
"You feel like lead oar in 'Ben Hur,' " said Bill Burnham, a top analyst for Credit Suisse First Boston who left to join Softbank Capital, an Internet-focused venture fund. "No one works harder than a tech banker or has less control over his life."
The lure of stock options is also potent. Thomas Casey, 47, left as co-head of global telecommunications and media at Merrill Lynch to head corporate development, among other things, at Global Crossing, a new company that is building a fiber optic network for Internet traffic.
At first, the move was a roll of the dice. He left behind a hefty pay package -- $3 million to $5 million a year at his level. When he started at Global Crossing, he took a huge pay cut. But he got options on 2 million shares when the stock was valued at $2 a share. Those options are now valued at nearly $90 million.
"On Wall Street, you are not going to be so rich that your children and grandchildren would never have to work again," Mr. Casey said. "But you have that opportunity if you go to a start-up."
Mr. Casey said money was only one motivation. "Ultimately, I wanted to be in a position where I participated directly in creating something substantial," he said.
Today, some Wall Street firms are responding aggressively. Nearly all the big ones have taken stakes in online trading companies, including virtual stock-trading forums known as electronic communications networks. Most now allow clients to buy and sell securities on the Internet. Several analysts predict that Wall Street's willingness to compete online will slow the growth of purely online rivals -- and perhaps stem the outflow of seasoned bankers.
But John Hewitt, a longtime Goldman vice president who helped execute that firm's efforts to modernize its technology, still sees the biggest securities firms as being stuck in another era. He recently left Goldman to become president of Knight/Trimark, which has used technology and low fees to lure stock-trading business.
Mr. Hewitt, 48, said he long expected to retire as a Goldman employee. But the more he learned about the Internet, he said, the more it gnawed at him -- to the point that he raised his hand for the Knight/Trimark job during a business dinner with Ken Pasternak, the chief executive.
"All the Wall Street firms, Goldman included, have become so successful that they have a vested interest in the status quo," Mr. Hewitt said. "The more I thought about it, the more I felt I had to go somewhere that had a sense of speed and that wasn't afraid of the future."

HEADLINE: Bush Tangles With McCain Over Campaign Financing

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI 

DATELINE: DES MOINES, Dec. 13

 BODY:
In the most spirited Republican debate so far, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Senator John McCain of Arizona sparred over Mr. McCain's advocacy of overhauling the nation's campaign finance laws, with Mr. Bush declining Mr. McCain's offer that the two take a joint pledge against accepting so-called soft money, largely unregulated corporate contributions.
Mr. McCain, who has emerged as the most potent challenger to Mr. Bush for the Republican presidential nomination, told Mr. Bush that special interests were controlling the federal government and that, "You and I can stop that tonight." 
 "We can commit, as nominees of the party, that we'll have nothing to do with soft money," Mr. McCain said
Mr. Bush answered that such a repudiation of soft money would amount to "unilateral disarmament" by giving an advantage to Democrats, who benefit from donations from labor unions.
Without soft money, Mr. Bush said, "Our Republican Party and conservative values don't have a chance."
The exchange underscored Mr. McCain's efforts to portray himself as an insurgent outsider and as the only candidate willing to speak often unpopular truths, an image that he further burnished tonight by denouncing federal ethanol subsidies in a state that cherishes them and challenging Mr. Bush and other candidates to defend the program.
The discussions of campaign finance laws and ethanol subsidies were just two of instances tonight in which Mr. Bush's challengers -- in particular, Mr. McCain and Gary L. Bauer -- sought to put him on the defensive or pin him down in uncomfortable ways.
Mr. Bush's lackluster performances in two forums earlier this month had come under intense scrutiny and criticism, with even some Republican officials expressing disappointment in the impression he had made. Tonight, a few of his opponents clearly smelled blood.
But Mr. Bush responded to their attacks, direct and indirect, with a more assertive demeanor and a more confident manner than he had exhibited in previous debates. He also mounted his own offensives, saying that the tax cut he has proposed provides economic relief for some low-income people and noting that Mr. McCain's plan does not.
Like Mr. McCain, Mr. Bauer tried to coax Mr. Bush into a vow: a promise that if Mr. Bush became the Republican nominee, he would choose a running mate who opposed legal abortion.
Mr. Bauer mentioned the New Jersey governor, Christine Todd Whitman, who supports abortion rights, as someone whom Mr. Bush should assure Americans would not be chosen as the vice presidential candidate.
But Mr. Bush, an easy smile on his face, essentially chided Mr. Bauer for focusing on a narrow issue, saying that the most important criteria for a vice president was that the person be able to ascend to the presidency if necessary, be loyal and share his conservative views.
At other times, the rules that were supposed to govern the debate, which took place in the Des Moines Civic Center, failed to rein in candidates who seemed more eager than ever to challenge and comment on each other's answers, producing some pungent and occasionally funny dialogue as the discussion ranged from gun control and health care to the vanishing of the family farms and America's trading relationship with China.
Mr. Bauer and Mr. Bush in particular quarreled over that last topic, with Mr. Bauer challenging Mr. Bush's support of China's entry into the World Trade Organization.
Mr. Bauer said that if he became president, "I will stop allowing China to play us for suckers."
"They dump their goods here," Mr. Bauer said, "and Iowa farmers are selling less to China now than they did 10 years ago."
Mr. Bush defended his position, saying that China's place in the trade organization would help change that, because they would feel more beholden and compelled to comply with reciprocal trade laws.
"Opening up Chinese markets is good for Iowa farmers," Mr. Bush said in a defiant voice.
"They haven't kept their agreements for 20 years," Mr. Bauer shot back.
But Mr. Bush and Mr. Bauer found agreement on something else: both of them cited Jesus Christ when the candidates were asked to name their favorite philosopher-thinkers.
Mr. Bush said simply, "Christ, because he changed my heart."
John Bachman, an anchor for WHO-TV in Des Moines, the sponsor of the debate, seemed surprised by the brief response and said, "I think the viewer would like to know more on how he's changed your heart."
To that, Mr. Bush said, "Well, if they don't know, it's going to be hard to explain. When you turn your heart and your life over to Christ, when you accept Christ as the savior, it changes your heart. It changes your life. And that's what happened to me."
Moments later, Mr. Bauer offered a fuller response in which he quoted scripture. "Christ," Mr. Bauer added, "taught all of us about our obligations to each other, to the unborn child, to those living in poverty, the need for us to be together regardless of the color of our skin."
The candidates began mixing it up when Mr. McCain was asked about his push to reduce pork barrel spending, and, unprompted, brought up his opposition to federal subsidies for ethanol, a corn-based fuel.
Support for ethanol subsidies is a litmus test for candidates in Iowa, but Mr. McCain, apparently seeking to bolster his case that he is willing to oppose special interests, flatly said he would cut the program.
"I'm here to tell you the things you don't want to hear as well as the things you do, and one of them is ethanol," said Mr. McCain, who has adopted an unusual, possibly risky strategy of ignoring Iowa so that he can devote more time to other states with early contests, particularly New Hampshire, Arizona and South Carolina. Mr. McCain is making the most of his maverick image and plans a joint appearance with Bill Bradley, one of the Democratic presidential candidates, on Thursday to discuss campaign finance reform.
Mr. Bush unflinchingly explained his support for ethanol. "It's good for our air," he said. "It also reduces our dependency on foreign oil."
"Who knows?" Mr. Bush added. "Maybe someday we'll be driving automobiles with 100 percent corn product. And guess what? We can grow it right here in Iowa."
Steve Forbes, the publisher, who is hoping that a strong second-place finish to Mr. Bush in Iowa will add velocity to his candidacy, said that the federal government has to do much more research in general to find uses for agricultural products.
And Alan Keyes, often a voice of conservative moralism in these forums, rued the dwindling number of family farms not as an economic reality but as a cultural one, saying that some of the country's most enduring, bedrock values are tied to agricultural life.
Once again, the event was something of a showcase for Senator Orrin G. Hatch, a long-shot candidate who has carved a niche as the droll jester.
Mr. Hatch drew one of the most rousing responses of the evening after Mr. Forbes said of Democratic proposals, "That usually means hold your wallet."
Mr. Hatch turned to Mr. Forbes and interjected, "Steve, I couldn't even lift your wallet is all I can say."
Tonight's debate, which was moderated by Mr. Bachman and Tom Brokaw of NBC News, was the third in only 11 days to feature all six candidates for the party's nomination, and it was the first to take place in Iowa, a pivotal state whose precinct caucus on Jan. 24 is the opening contest of the primary season. The first primary, in New Hampshire, comes eight days later.
Mr. Bush appears to be on much sturdier ground in Iowa than in New Hampshire, where Mr. McCain has pulled ahead of him in recent polls.
The two previous Republican forums -- in Manchester, N.H., on Dec. 3, and in Phoenix on Dec. 6 -- were strikingly cordial affairs with the six candidates speaking to and about one another in relatively restrained, respectful terms.
But Mr. Bush's opponents, still trailing him in national polls, made subtle and sometimes indirect efforts on those occasions to chip into that lead by portraying him as someone without the requisite experience, seriousness or intellectual maturity to lead the country.
After the second of those debates, political analysts and journalists placed a microscope over everything from the downward slant of Mr. Bush's lips, which seen by some as a smirk, to his seeming adherence to a practiced script.
Tonight, he may have reassured some supporters and quieted some critics. While the corners of his mouth still turned downward at times, he seemed less cautious.

RESNICK, PEARL

 BODY:
RESNICK-Pearl. Bar-Ilan University in Israel and its American Friends, mourn the passing of one of our most beloved leaders, who played an important role in our development, Pearl Resnick. Together with her late husband, Jack, she was a longtime patron of the University. After his passing, she continued her involvement not only as a benefactress, but also as a member of both the Global Board of Trustees and the American Board of Trustees. Her interest in every program of the University's mission was tremendous. She loved the traditional dimension of the University and was especially concerned with the personal welfare of faculty and students, particularly those who had emigrated from Russia. Indeed, she established the Jack and Pearl Resnick Institute for the Absorbtion and Retraining of Russian Immigrant Scientists, and subsequently built the permanent home of the Resnick Institute. Beyond the actual programs, her warm and loving personality evoked enormous respect from all who had the privilege to know her. She was truly love incarnate. To her children, grandchildren and great grandchildren she was a loving and devoted matriarch whose love was characteristic of her person and all that she did. With this love, she inspired her family to carry on with her same spirit of matchless generosity for every worthy cause, Jewish, American and humanitarian. There can be no doubt that she will be missed by all of us. We extend our heartfelt condolences to the entire family. Rabbi Emanuel Rackman, Chancellor, Bar-Ilan University Prof. Moshe Kaveh, President, Bar-Ilan University Aharon Dahan, Chairman, Global Board of Trustees Charles Dimston, Chairman, American Board of Trustees Melvin Stein, President, American Friends of Bar-Ilan University Gen. (Ret.) Yehuda Halevy, Executive Vice President Bar-Ilan University
RESNICK-Pearl. The DOROT community is stricken by the passing of Pearl Resnick, a remarkable woman whose clear-eyed, warmhearted support of major medical, communal, educational and arts organizations improved the lives of thousands. Pearl was the source of a tradition of communal involvement that has flowed like a shining stream from generation to generation in her family. As a generous DOROT supporter and sponsor of our Thanksgiving Banquet for the elderly, Pearl created an annual highlight that truly gave our elders reason to give thanks, and an experience to cherish throughout the year. Her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren carry on her tradition through their leadership as members of the DOROT Board, service on planning committees, fundraising efforts, and hands-on participation in our Package Deliveries. Pearl was the designated recipient of DOROT's Rose Sommer Generations Award, which she would have received at DOROT's Gala in May 2000 as part of a salute to the Katz-Resnick family, "Four Generations Helping Generations". We are devastated that the award will have to be presented posthumously. Our hearts go out to Pearl's children: Marilyn and Stanley, Burton and Judith, and Ira and Paula; her grandchildren: Neil and Amy, Bruce and Bonnie, Roni and Stuart, Scott, John and Susie, Peter, Daniel, Benjamin, Joshua, Jordana; her great-grandchildren: Jaclyn, David, Nicole, Brian, and Stephanie; and her extended family upon the loss of this vivacious and inspiring woman. May they find solace in their personal memories, in her legacy of tzedka and chesed which flourishes in them, and in the knowledge that her name will forever be a blessing. Vivian Fenster Ehrlich, Executive Director Anne E. Heyman, President Renee Adler Ascher, Board Chair
RESNICK-Pearl. The Yeshiva University family is profoundly grieved by the passing of a dear friend, a distinguished humanitarian, and a communal leader who was the matriarch of a family that has long played a leadership role at YU and its Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Widely beloved for her sterling character and inspiring personality, she was a YU Trustee, AECOM Overseer, and Benefactor with her late husband, Jack Resnick, a longtime AECOM Overseer. In 1989, the University conferred upon her an honorary doctor of humane letters degree, noting her "staunch dedication and tireless efforts on behalf of this University." For their endowment of a range of vital programs at AECOM, Mr. and Mrs. Resnick were honored in 1990 with the naming of the College's Jack and Pearl Resnick Campus. The family legacy is continued by children, Benefactors Burton P. (and Judith) Resnick, chairman, Executive Committee, YU Board of Trustees, and chairperson, AECOM Board of Overseers; Marilyn (and Stanley M.) Katz, Benefactors and AECOM Board members; and Ira (and Paula) Resnick, YU Guardians. We extend our heartfelt condolences as well to grandchildren and the entire family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Dr. Norman Lamm, President Yeshiva University David S. Gottesman, Chairman Board of Trustees
RESNICK-Pearl. We will miss the warmth, grace and compassion of our very special friend and Benefactor, who for more than four decades helped to nurture and sustain medical research and educational programs at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University. We are honored to have known her and to have benefited from her wise counsel as a distinguished member of our Board of Overseers and of the board of our National Women's Division. Her good deeds on our behalf include the endowment of an academic chair in brain tumor research in memory of her late daughter, Susan Fisher, and, with her late husband Jack, the establishment of a gerontology center. In 1990, in recognition of the extraordinary role Pearl and Jack Resnick played in the life of our institution, we proudly named our campus in their honor. To Mrs. Resnick's children, Burton P. Resnick, chairperson of our Board, and his wife Judith; to Marilyn and Stanley M. Katz, members of our Board, and Ira Resnick, a respected member of our Society of Founders, and his wife, Paula; to her ten grandchildren and to the entire family, we extend our most heartfelt sympathy.

HEADLINE: Wages vs. Warrants

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
In the months leading up to the current contract showdown, the president of Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union maneuvered to turn the dispute into one focusing on economic justice for New York City's subway and bus workers.
In every speech, in every interview, the union president, Willie James, sought to win public sympathy and throw management on the defensive by talking about how his hard-working members had made major concessions in their last contract and had not shared in the city's economic boom. 
 But last week, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani jumped into the fray and in a mere few minutes transformed the terms of the dispute from economic justice to law and order, reminding the union that a transit strike would be illegal and would cripple the city.
Mr. Giuliani also reminded union leaders and members that he would seek maximum punishment against the union for breaking the law. With his threats, many labor experts say, the mayor has single-handedly reduced the chances of a strike by forcing Mr. James and his union's members to think twice about a walkout and its consequences.
Mr. Giuliani has transformed the dispute in another way -- it is no longer so much a fight between Mr. James and an anonymous bureaucracy, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Rather, it has become a mano a mano dispute between the mayor and Mr. James, and many labor experts say that Mr. Giuliani inevitably has the upper hand because he has on his side the state Taylor Law, which bars strikes by public employees.
But the mayor's tough stance has complicated matters by pushing Mr. James into a corner, and some labor experts said that could backfire. The union leader, who eked out a narrow election victory last year, cannot let himself be seen as knuckling under to the mayor because he would lose credibility with his members.
"The way the mayor has taken a fairly bellicose stand toward labor-management relations," said William Kornblum, a labor expert at City University Graduate Center, "can lead unions to up their demands, mobilize people and get them to prepare for a strike."
However much Mr. Giuliani and Mr. James might want to deny it, the dispute is a big political test for both of them.
A transit strike that creates havoc for millions of New Yorkers could embarrass the mayor and, at a time he is preparing for a race for United States Senate, undercut his reputation for competence even though he does not control the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, a state agency that is controlled by the governor. A calamitous strike could weaken the mayor the way the 1969 blizzard and the troubles plowing the streets badly undermined Mayor John V. Lindsay.
Some labor experts say the mayor has pressured the transit workers to scale back their wage demands on the theory that if they win hefty increases, he will be under pressure to be just as generous with the city's nearly 300,000 unionized workers who are scheduled to negotiate contracts next year.
For Mr. James, the stakes are high because if he does not deliver at the bargaining table, his members can easily vote him out in union elections scheduled for next year.
His need to show his mettle, labor experts say, helps explain why Mr. James has talked so tough and has repeatedly threatened a strike. While an illegal strike can result in victory and can make a union leader a defiant hero, it is a high-risk strategy that can result in jail, huge fines and a crushed union.
On one hand, the 12-day transit strike of 1966 turned the union's leader, Michael J. Quill, into just such a hero, even though, or perhaps because, he was sent to jail. On the other hand, the union fared far worse in the 11-day strike of 1980 because it was fined $1.25 million and its treasury was all but wiped out.
Mr. Giuliani has done his best to convince Mr. James and his union that if they strike, the results will be like those in 1980, not 1966. The mayor has implied that if they walk out on his watch, they will be walking the plank.
Even some frequent critics of the mayor, like Ester R. Fuchs, director of the Barnard-Columbia Center for Urban Policy, say his strategy seems to be working.
"I think the mayor is doing the only thing he knows how to do -- he is not somebody who uses honey or sugar to get what he wants," she said. "He thinks that punishment and retribution are the way to push people back in line. His hard-line strategy may work in the end because the transit workers can't afford the kind of fines the court will impose."
When Mr. Giuliani was asked his views of the transit dispute last Wednesday, he said he should not get involved because the dispute was between the union and the M.T.A. But by Friday, he had changed course and resumed his normally tough persona, perhaps recognizing that he might be blamed for a disastrous strike even though he does not control the M.T.A., although its executive directive, Marc V. Shaw, had been his budget director.
So the mayor attacked both sides for not negotiating around the clock, suggesting that they, not he, would be to blame for any strike.
Sounding like an angry Norse god, he also threatened to rain thunder and brimstone down upon the union if its members walked out. He threatened to get a court injunction, he warned the union that it could face millions of dollars in fines, and he told members they could lose two days' pay for every day on strike.
Ever since the mayor threatened to lower the boom, Mr. James has sounded more optimistic about a settlement. But he has also remained defiant toward the mayor, calling his interference counterproductive.
"I'm not scared of the Taylor Law," Mr. James said. "I'm not going to allow anything the mayor says intimidate this union or myself to accept a substandard contract that's not worthy of my members' consideration."

HEADLINE: MY JOB;
I Write Copy for a Web Start-up

BYLINE: By DEIRDRE SHAW 

 BODY:
A few weeks ago, I abandoned the sinking ship of newspaper journalism and hopped aboard a pirate vessel, the Internet. Instead of writing news for a venerable newspaper, I'm now providing content for a Silicon Alley start-up founded by two 20-somethings.
My fellow reporters and I often grumbled about the long hours, low pay and humdrum assignments at the Philadelphia daily where we toiled on the suburban beat. Yet, when I told them where I was going and added that, yes, at the tender age of 27, I'd be receiving stock options, I saw sellout in their eyes. 
 Sellout? Maybe. But in journalism, you have to work your way up the ladder for years. After all, your bosses have worked their way up the ladder. So, you put in time at newspapers in states like Iowa and Louisiana, and then maybe you have a shot at a staff job on a newspaper in New York or San Francisco.
In the new economy, if you're smart and confident, you don't have to wait in line. You can be whatever you want to be. There are no ladders and no pigeonholes.
My new bosses at InfoRocket, an online information-auction company where users pay other users for answers to their questions, seemed excited about my arrival. Experiment with the copy, they told me. We trust you.
So I admit it: I was probably rubbing it in when I told my newspaper friends that InfoRocket's co-founder, Matt Cassin, 24, was wearing shorts during my interview. And that irreverent employees had scrawled site models and quotes like "Revolt Against Time" in black ink on the office's white walls. (I later learned this was because the walls were to be torn down.)
But it wasn't just the casual atmosphere that struck me; what bowled me over was the sheer energy of the place. People were coming and going, banging away furiously at the keyboards, shouting across rooms. At one point, Teo Montoya, 25, the other co-founder, stumbled into the room unshaven and disheveled. He had been up all night writing code, but that didn't stop him from sitting down with me for an hour to talk about everything from my favorite movies to the "new information paradigms."
I hate to say it, but the hectic pace made me wonder if this Internet start-up didn't resemble a newsroom back in the heyday of newspapers. I belonged here, I told myself.
I didn't have a computer or a desk for the first three days, and it took even longer to get a telephone. But on my first day the company ordered pizza and my 13 colleagues and I sat around the conference table. "O.K., team," said Matt. "How is everything going? Do we need to discuss anything?"
We really didn't, but we did anyway. I was forced to reveal my most embarrassing moment. (Losing my bathing suit while water-skiing, if you must know.)
Now, I'm hard at work planning the e-mail newsletter I'll eventually be writing for our users. "I have lots of ideas," I say. "We'll take 'em," my colleagues reply.

HEADLINE: Spreading Harlem's Boom To a Neglected Boulevard

BYLINE: By NINA SIEGAL 

 BODY:
If 125th Street is Harlem's Cinderella, emerging from the ashes to a kind of nobility, Frederick Douglass Boulevard, the lean corridor that stretches north through the neighborhood from Central Park West, is her warted stepsister, abandoned in the ruins.
The boulevard is pockmarked with vacant lots, abandoned buildings and other unsightly signs of blight. The Manhattan borough president, C. Virginia Fields, has called it an embarrassment to the city, especially as the rest of Harlem undergoes an economic rebirth that she and others have referred to as its second renaissance. 
 On Friday, Ms. Fields unveiled a plan for the redevelopment of the boulevard from 110th to 135th Streets, announcing that she would commit $2.5 million from her capital budget during the next three years to support development activities along the corridor. The proposal identified 16 sites, mostly on city-owned land, along the boulevard as prime spots for residential and retail development, and suggested specific uses for each one.
While much of the capital financing was pledged to provide money only where necessary for residential construction and was not otherwise specifically earmarked, the proposal identified three city-owned vacant lots that Ms. Fields's office is moving to develop within two years, with cooperation from the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development.
Her office has designated an additional $1.05 million for the renovation of Frederick Douglass Circle at the northwest corner of Central Park, along with other streetscape improvements along the corridor.
"Frederick Douglass Boulevard is the central north-south corridor in the community," Ms. Fields told about 150 community leaders, corporate investors and real estate developers at a conference she convened at the State Office Building on 125th Street. "It is the backbone of Harlem. Its redevelopment will send a powerful message that the second Harlem renaissance has deep and permanent roots in the community."
The proposal was the result of a study commissioned by Ms. Fields from the Urban Technical Assistance Project of the Columbia University Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation.
In general, it envisions Frederick Douglass Boulevard as a residential corridor where older buildings would be renovated, new low-rise apartment buildings would be built on now-vacant lots, and street-level storefronts would be used for small businesses.
Ms. Fields did not say how much it would cost to finance the proposal and said she could not provide an estimate. Her spokeswoman, Lisa V. Daglian, said no elements of the plan were final.
"What they are is potential projects," Ms. Daglian said. "They are sites we consider, based on the study, to be prime development opportunities." Ms. Fields said the plan would succeed only if there was an effective partnership between the public and private sectors.
Ms. Fields's presentation on Friday, essentially a pep talk to encourage investors to join in the revitalization of Frederick Douglass Boulevard, seemed to have drawn interest from developers, although some thought her remarks focused too heavily on corporate investment in the neighborhood.
"We all know the stock market is very fickle, and I don't think we can depend on our corporate partners if the stock market crashes," said Thomas Lopez-Pierre, a managing member of the Kierra Trenee Pierre Partners, an Upper Manhattan business that owns and manages franchise restaurants. "We need to stand on a foundation of community ownership. Otherwise Harlem will be left to burn in the aftermath of a market crash."

HEADLINE: Business Travel;
An upbeat government report and some sour industry notes on the future of global aviation.

BYLINE: By Edwin McDowell; The Business Travel column appears each Wednesday. Edwin McDowell's e-mail is emcdowell@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
SEVERAL days before the start of an international aviation conference in Chicago early this month, the United States Transportation Department released an upbeat report about the future of aviation and the success of the various Open Skies agreements.
Those agreements between nations permit unrestricted air service by airlines of each country to, from and beyond the other's territory, with no limit on the number of flights, the type of aircraft and the prices they can charge. The United States has agreements with 38 countries worldwide. 
 The Transportation Department found that from 1996 to 1998, on routes connecting interior cities in both the United States and foreign countries, fares fell an average of 17.5 percent where Open Skies was in effect. In markets without Open Skies agreements, the average decrease was 3.5 percent. The department also noted that the global impact of air transport would approach $2 trillion in 2010, almost double that of 1994, and directly and indirectly would account for more than 30 million jobs, 6 million more than in 1994.
But the "Beyond Open Skies" conference in Chicago heard a less upbeat view of the future of aviation from James Goodwin, the chief executive of UAL's United Airlines, the nation's biggest carrier. Declaring global aviation at a crisis point, he said there was not enough runway space, terminals or parking space to accommodate the millions of arrivals and departures and the one billion passengers projected to fly on United States airlines by 2012, up from 680 million passengers this year. And he laid most of the responsibility at the door of the nation's air traffic control system.
This is not the first such industry warning. Earlier this year, Carol Hallet, president of the Air Transport Association, made similar predictions, contending that the air traffic control system was inadequate to handle the current 21,000 daily flights, much less the billion passengers expected within the next dozen years. In addition, the magazine Aviation Week and Space Technology primarily cited the United States government for the growing air travel crisis, a crisis in which "passenger safety could be severely compromised."
But it is rare to hear such forebodings by an airline executive at a conference intended to celebrate the growth and economic importance of the aviation industry. Nevertheless, Mr. Goodwin warned that if something is not done soon, air traffic delays would triple in 10 years, costing passengers both time and money.
 
A Matter of Service
Today is the deadline for the airline industry to put into effect its improved customer service provisions. These include giving passengers notification of cancellations, delays and diversions; replying within 60 days of receiving written complaints, and advising of the lowest fare available for each flight.
But individual airlines have gone beyond that, pledging to notify passengers by phone (instead of at the airport) of flight cancellations when known at least two hours before departure (Delta Air Lines), promising not to keep passengers aboard delayed planes for more than an hour (Northwest Airlines) and establishing a consumer advisory board to give advice about the airline's performance (U S Airways).
U S Airways yesterday vowed to allow passengers to cancel purchased tickets within 24 hours without penalty and promised to make prompt refunds. Two days ago, Continental Airlines said that a so-called Service Planning Center would be installed at each of its hub airports in Newark, Houston and Cleveland to rebook passengers on alternate flights, make hotel reservations and generally assist fliers.
But judging from reaction on the Internet and in trade publications in recent weeks, the flying public is taking a decidedly wait-and-see attitude.
 
Passenger Rights
Passenger rights are spelled out on a Web site recently introduced by the National Business Travel Association (www.BizTraveler.org). There are also some 2,000 travel tips, including how and where to file a travel complaint, warnings about regions to avoid because of safety or weather threats, what to do when bumped or delayed, how to travel with a laptop computer or with children, and what safety precautions to take in hotels.
Those tips were collected from more than 1,400 of the association's corporate travel managers, and although intended for business travelers, they should prove equally helpful for all travelers. The Web site's passenger complaint form will allow the association to monitor the actual level of service being delivered in the travel industry, seek a remedy if possible, and, in the case of air travel, compile a report from the responses and forward it to the appropriate regulatory body.

HEADLINE: IDEAS INTO ACTION;
It's Not the Product That's Different, It's the Process

BYLINE: By FRED ANDREWS; This column about management issues appears every other week. Fred Andrews's e-mail address is frandrew@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
MARSHALL McLUHAN wrote 35 years ago that the medium is the message, a puzzling perception that turned out to be profound. Today, a great many business thinkers, in one way or another, seem to be saying something similar: In the new economy, the process is the product.
Set aside the electronic gadgetry. Are the other things we buy -- the cars we drive, the shoes we wear, the trips we take -- all that different from what they were when the other George Bush was president? 
 Not really. The shirts and skirts and jackets we wear today are pretty much the same as the ones that hung in our closet a decade ago. But the ways they are produced -- all the steps from textile plant to doorstep delivery -- have been overhauled, in a forced infusion of information technology. In the 1990's, the apparel industry saved its skin by bringing off a process revolution all but invisible to the consumer.
Something similarly invisible is taking shape now with the Internet. Who could possibly escape the squall of dot-com retailing this season? But largely out of sight, the Internet is also devising the institutions that will enable businesses to deal with one another in radically different ways.
Corporate America seems to have concluded that the train -- the Internet Express -- is leaving the station. The foundations of a new business order are being laid right now. And unless companies respond in kind, they will wither like towns on the Great Plains that failed to attract the early rail lines.
Richard R. Roscitt, the new president of AT&T's huge Business Services arm, made his reputation building complex Internet-based networks for corporate giants. He thought he saw the makings of a business revolution in the Internet several years ago, but he is astounded at how quickly it came. "You would have to have had a crystal ball," he marveled in an interview last week.
The commanding heights of business have come alive to the power of networking as a pervasive way of doing business, Mr. Roscitt said. Established giants are shifting critical functions to the Internet, at least to their roped-off corner of it. Merrill Lynch has embraced online trading, Citibank sends trillions of dollars a day across the Net. The Internet is pumping "the lifeblood of the organization," Mr. Roscitt said. "The stakes are much higher."
The chronic weakness among automakers has been a development process that moves at a turtle's pace. Now AT&T is building an Internet network for General Motors that will enable G.M. to bring cars to market more quickly. The five-year, $350 million project will link G.M. design centers, factory floors and dealerships the world over and allow them to perform continuously as though they were side by side.
In "Blown to Bits" (Harvard Business School Press, 1999), Philip Evans and Thomas S. Wurster, partners at the Boston Consulting Group, argue that communication via the Internet has become so cheap and so powerful -- and still no end in sight -- that it will shatter today's business order. They predict it will force every business in America to pick apart the processes that lie behind its products and consider putting the chain back together in novel ways.
It has always been costly to convey thorough, reliable, timely, rich information. That reality protected those who could afford to play. On the Internet, the cost will all but dry up. And once pure information is cut loose from the expensive physical means of delivering it, whether a printing plant and a fleet of trucks or a dedicated network of mainframe computers, the value of all those old arrangements comes into question.
In the new economy, information will substitute for goods. Branch Rickey once remarked that luck was the residue of design. Mr. Evans and Mr. Wurster write that "inventory is merely the physical correlate of deficient information." Not nearly as epigrammatic, but it is a powerful thought: The more known about what customers want, the less the need to tie up money in expensive (and perishable) stock. The process replaces the product.
Exactly that notion about inventory drove the remaking of the American garment trade. Apparel makers, under searing pressure from retailers like Wal-Mart, used computer links and the sharing of sales and production data to create a discipline of speedy response. They successfully met the simultaneous demands of "lean retailing" for both lower inventories and a much greater variety of goods, at lower prices and in smaller, more frequent deliveries.
The story of how information technology enabled the American garment industry to triumph over low-cost competition overseas is told in "A Stitch in Time" (Oxford University Press, 1999) by Frederick H. Abernathy, John T. Dunlop, Janice H. Hammond and David Weil.
Laser technology permitted the key innovation: the bar code, which tracks demand at the cash register and the status of goods at every earlier stage. That system in turn required computers and software to monitor thousands of prices and millions of items.
But the industry also had to abandon old thinking and invent a new way for handling goods, the bustling hub known as the modern distribution center. "A distribution center," the authors of "A Stitch in Time" remark dryly, "is the antithesis of a warehouse." Goods sit in a warehouse; they speed through a distribution center on conveyor belts, racing from supply trucks at inbound bays to delivery trucks at outbound.
And yet nothing would flow until everything fit. The industry had to hammer out common standards at every juncture, from the bar-coding itself to labels on shipping cartons to uniform price tags and garment hangers.
That history came before the Internet, but the pattern is instructive. The new order will require not only lasers and computers but also, like lean retailing, fresh thinking about old processes and new arrangements of bricks and mortar. The apparel rebirth relied on expensive computer systems tying giant retailers more tightly to selected suppliers. By contrast, the Internet will be open and cheap, accessible to a host of new and smaller suppliers.
Uniform standards, essential in every era, now define the day. The Internet itself consists of agreements to communicate in a certain way. New protocols are being added industry by industry. With every added layer, the Internet connects new realms and thousands of new participants. Mr. Evans and Mr. Wurster of Boston Consulting say that in many ways this standard setting is more profound than the dazzling technology. Mr. Roscitt of AT&T says it is the only way to fly.
"Internet protocol is what everyone's going to jump on," Mr. Roscitt said. "No one in their right mind would build anything not based on that."

American apparel makers were a fading force until they learned to view their product as a process of harnessing information along a chain that runs from the factory floor to the retail counter.
 
Bar codes identify items so they can be tracked as they move through the supply chain. At the cash register, they monitor demand and sharpen sales forecasts.
 
Computer systems and software connect retailers to their suppliers, keeping track of thousands of orders and millions of items, from textile plant to final sale.
 
The modern distribution center is a bustling hub that funnels goods quickly from apparel makers to retail stores.
 
Uniform standards permit goods from many producers to flow smoothly through the system. They range from computer codes to shipping labels to garment hangers.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Accentuating the Negative, 30-Year Yield Rises to 6.30%

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury yields rose sharply yesterday as investors chose to ignore November's moderate consumer price data and instead focused on stronger-than-expected retail sales.
The Federal Reserve has said it will raise interest rates again if there is evidence of continuing strong growth, even if the inflation rate remains tame. For that reason, Treasuries had their biggest decline in months yesterday as investors grew concerned that the central bank would indeed raise rates to try to brake the economy's growth. 
 The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 1 11/32, to 97 21/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, increased to 6.30 percent from 6.20 percent on Monday.
The surge in the yield of the long bond was the largest since August, as buyers moved to the sidelines amid concern that strong holiday retail sales would bolster fourth-quarter growth and help build inflationary pressure, increasing the odds that the Fed would soon raise rates.
"Clues of budding wage pressures and potential labor strife are beginning to build," said Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, "and with gas prices at the pump continuing to rise amid surging economic growth, the specter of rising inflationary expectations down the pike is very likely to translate into higher bond yields."
Mr. Fine said these concerns had not gone unnoticed by the Fed. While the central bank is expected to leave short-term rates alone at its next policy meeting on Dec. 21 to avoid rocking the boat during the Year 2000 transition period, he said, another increase is expected during the first quarter unless there is evidence of a slackening economy.
In addition, long-term interest rates could come under pressure as the year unfolds, and could weaken stock prices.
Treasuries fell yesterday after the Commerce Department reported that retail sales rose nine-tenths of 1 percent in November. Combined with upward revisions in previous months and reports of busy Christmas shopping nationwide, the report suggested that consumer spending remained extremely strong.
Also leading the bond selloff were investors' liquidating their long positions before the end of the year. Although such selling was relatively small in size, such volume allowed it to cause large swings in prices, traders said.
Sherry Cooper, chief economist for Nesbitt Burns Securities, said early reports suggested no let-up in personal spending in December. "The trend in consumer spending remains too hot for the bond market's liking," she said. "Retailers have entered the critical Christmas shopping season with considerable momentum."
"The bottom line," Ms. Cooper added, "is that on balance, the pervasive strength in retail sales outweighs the good news on the C.P.I. for bonds, but the mix of a strong consumer and still-tame inflation is positive for stocks."

Teachers Retain Paterson for Talks
The United Federation of Teachers has retained BASIL A. PATERSON, a former state senator and deputy mayor, and his law firm, Meyer Suozzi English & Klein, to handle the contract negotiations with New York City. 
In talks for the current contract, RANDI WEINGARTEN, the union's president now but its general counsel then, was lead negotiator. Ms. Weingarten said she wanted to bring in a labor lawyer for the next round, in which Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is expected to seek a merit pay plan and the teachers are expected to demand increases for their 140,000 members to bring their incomes closer to those of their suburban counterparts. Mr. Paterson has negotiated on behalf of other city unions.
 Ms. Weingarten says she is planning to present a contract proposal early next year. The current contract expires next November.
 
Honoring a Man for All Semesters
Talk about longevity. Columbia University honored MICHAEL I. SOVERN last week for his 50 years at the university, including 6 as a student, 9 as a law school dean, and 13 as the university's president. (He played hooky for two years after his law school graduation, in 1955, when he taught law at the University of Minnesota.)
The crowd of about 500 that gathered at the Plaza Hotel to celebrate his tenure included former professors, students and colleagues, as well as representatives of groups where he was chairman or president, like the Shubert Foundation, the American Academy in Rome and the Japan Society. Even with those diversions, Mr. Sovern, 68, can't seem to tear himself away from Columbia. He is back in the classroom, teaching legal methods to entering law students. According to the celebration's program notes, Mr. Sovern threatens to remain as long as he can "lurch to the lectern."
 
Going From Collegiate to Concord
JACOB A. DRESDEN, who has been headmaster of the Collegiate School, the private academy on the Upper West Side, since 1991, will become the head of the Concord Academy in Massachusetts July 1. His departure was announced in October. Mr. Dresden, 56, will replace Thomas E. Wilcox, who is leaving Concord after 19 years to form a national program to teach science and technology to inner-city students.
Mr. Dresden's wife, PATRICIA MARKLE DRESDEN, will leave her post as head of the lower school at Marymount School, the Roman Catholic girls school on Fifth Avenue opposite the Metropolitan Museum, to move to Boston as well. Mrs. Dresden said she intended to remain in education, but had not settled on a new position.
 
New York State 3rd in Teacher Pay
New York State ranked third, behind Connecticut and New Jersey, in a recent salary survey conducted by the the American Federation of Teachers based on the 1997-98 school year. The state's average was $48,712. Connecticut's was $51,727; New Jersey's was $50,284. The national average teacher salary was $39,347 annually. New York ranked second to Alaska in beginning teacher salary, which was $30,204 in New York.
The federation's president, SANDRA FELDMAN, said that in a boom economy, teacher salaries were falling behind those of other professions. ABBY GOODNOUGH, KAREN W. ARENSON and EDWARD WYATT

HEADLINE: Help E-Commerce Grow

 BODY:

To the Editor:
A Nov. 30 letter about the policies of the World Trade Organization and positions taken by Microsoft stated that the W.T.O. seeks to "make Internet commerce tax-free." In fact, the W.T.O. has only a moratorium on tariffs for transmissions over the Internet. But it has taken no position on taxes, like sales or value-added taxes, relating to online purchases. 
 Microsoft is one of many companies supporting this policy and urging extension of the tariff moratorium, because we believe that this results in lower prices for consumers, helps e-commerce grow and avoids discrimination against suppliers in international trade. It's important to note that the W.T.O.'s position does not alter individual countries' internal tax structures and certainly does not make Internet commerce "tax free."

Dow Closes Lower on Worries Over Long-Term Interest Rate

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday, hobbled by a drop in the technology sector and a jump in long-term interest rates on news that shoppers went on a big spending spree last month.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 32.42 points, or 0.29 percent, to 11,160.17. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 12.05 points, or 0.85 percent, to 1,403.17. 
 The Nasdaq composite index plunged 86.51 points, or 2.36 percent, to 3,571.66 after racking up 23 record closes in 31 trading sessions.
"The Nasdaq is at long last starting to go down," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at the First Albany Corporation.
"You could attribute it to profit taking set in motion by very sharp declines in the bond market as there is a growing concern that the economy remains too strong," he said.
Internet stocks, which helped push the Nasdaq to a series of record highs over the last four weeks, fell sharply.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond plunged 1 11/32, to 97 21/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.30 percent from 6.20 percent on Monday on worries that the Federal Reserve may have to raise interest rates again to slow the economy's growth.
In another sign of a speeding economy, the government reported retail stores perked up in November, beating forecasts, as shoppers hit stores after the Thanksgiving Day holiday in the traditional run-up to Christmas.
The Commerce Department said total sales soared 0.9 percent, to a seasonally adjusted $255.8 billion -- nearly twice the 0.5 percent increase forecast by Wall Street economists -- after a gain of 0.3 percent in October.
The jump in bond interest rates rattled financial stocks.
Among the Dow components, American Express was off 6 to to 160 1/2, and J. P. Morgan & Company was off 3 5/16 at 131 1/4. Citigroup was down 1 13/13 at 53 1/2.
The Labor Department reported that inflation was still subdued, with the Consumer Price Index up only 0.1 percent in November. Excluding food and energy, the index rose 0.2 percent.
Among Internet stocks, America Online was off 5 3/8 at 88 7/16 and Amazon.com slid 6 7/8, to 95 5/8.
Semiconductor stocks fell after Solectron, a custom electronics maker, slumped 9 1/8, to 82 5/8, on disappointing quarterly results.
Analysts said a shortage of components had hurt Solectron, and fear about the shortage dragged down chip makers.
Among them, Intel, a Dow component, was off 1 1/4 at 72 13/16 and Texas Instruments Inc. was off 9 5/16 at 96 5/8.
Microsoft rose 2 1/16, to 98 11/16, on speculation that there was a settlement of the government's antitrust suit against the company. Microsoft said the rumors were "unfounded."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Treasury Secretary Offers A New Vision for the I.M.F.

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: LONDON, Dec. 14

 BODY:
The Clinton administration, which has defended the International Monetary Fund against vocal critics at home and abroad for many years, has proposed that the fund redefine its mission, become less secretive and end some lending programs -- changes that critics have long demanded.
The proposed changes, the most thorough rethinking of the I.M.F.'s role in the world since the financial instability of the early 1970's, would limit its core mission to making emergency loans to countries that face short-term currency crises. In recent years, the I.M.F. has assumed a broader role in advising and lending to poor and developing countries, but has been widely criticized as ineffectual in administering some longer-term programs. 
 Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, speaking at the London Business School today ahead of a Berlin meeting of both advanced and developing economies, said the monetary fund should phase out long-term lending and cede some of its aid to developing countries to its sister agency, the World Bank. The fund should also be quicker to step aside when a country has ready access to private capital, Mr. Summers said.
"To say that the I.M.F. is indispensable is not to say that we can be satisfied with the one we have now," Mr. Summers said in a speech outlining the proposals. "Going forward, the I.M.F. needs to be more limited in its financial involvement with countries."
The blueprint for change is intended to serve as a mandate for a new managing director of the fund. Michel Camdessus, the current managing director, announced his resignation before the end of his term and will leave the I.M.F. in February. Choosing a new managing director, a post that has customarily been held by a European, will be an informal topic of discussion at the meeting in Berlin beginning on Thursday, American officials said.
The administration's plan appears to be a response to a growing chorus of critics of the fund, including economists and members of Congress, who have said that the I.M.F. could have done more to detect, prevent and contain the emerging-markets financial crisis that began in mid-1997. Though the crisis has passed without the worst fears of the I.M.F.'s critics having been realized, its lending programs to a few countries, most notably Russia, were widely considered to be failures.
Some members of Congress have tied their support for a highly promoted Clinton administration goal -- forgiving the debt of some of the poorest countries -- to an overhaul of the I.M.F. Others have called for changes similar to those Mr. Summers outlined today. Representative H. James Saxton, Republican of New Jersey, who monitors the fund, said that its long-term lending programs are conducive to corruption in poor countries and should be stopped.
In proposing the changes, Mr. Summers rejected calls for turning back the clock on the I.M.F. to a time when its mission was solely to help countries shore up foreign-exchange reserves, a measure taken to protect a currency from declining too sharply in value. The Treasury secretary said the fund should still provide some long-term credit and guidance to poor countries. He also said that the fund deserves praise for how it handled the financial crises of the last several years, even in Russia.
But he nonetheless prescribed a thorough revamping. Most notably, he said the fund should phase out low-interest-rate financing, forcing most countries to raise money from private sources at prevailing interest rates. If that were carried out in full, it would affect dozens of the fund's lending programs around the world. Some programs, like the one for the Philippines, have run as long as 25 years.
Mr. Summers also said the fund should become more open to the public, by publishing its annual budget, for example. And, he said, the fund should compel member countries to disclose many kinds of financial data they now provide on the condition that this remains secret. Though the change sounds simple, it would involve a cultural revolution at the I.M.F., which has operated more as an exclusive club of nations than a conduit of information to outsiders.
The fund welcomed Mr. Summers's comments in a statement issued today. "He has touched on a number of critical areas that need to be considered as we draw the lessons of the recent crisis and prepare for the future," the statement said.
But Mr. Camdessus, writing in an I.M.F. publication that predated the Summers speech, said the growth of the fund's lending programs was in response to a need among poor countries. He said proposals to drastically narrow the scope of the fund's work were misguided. "This would obviously be a recipe for irrelevance in today's world," Mr. Camdessus wrote. He could not be reached for comment on the remarks by Mr. Summers.
Some critics of the fund said the proposed changes were on target. But Jeffrey Sachs, who directs Harvard's Institute of International Development and has been a vocal opponent of I.M.F. practices, said that the fund, often with American support, continues to expand its mission in developing countries.
"In practice, the fund seems determined to hold on to a very broad agenda that impacts the lives of hundreds of millions of people," Mr. Sachs said. "The question here is whether we will see follow-through."

HEADLINE: A Divided Venezuela Votes on New Charter Today

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, Dec. 14

 BODY:
Venezuela has the chance on Wednesday to accelerate what its president, Hugo Chavez, terms a "peaceful revolution," or to reject what his opponents say would be a constitutional dictatorship benefiting Mr. Chavez at the expense of the millions of poor citizens he says he represents.
Rarely has a political fight divided this country, the world's third largest oil exporter and major supplier to the United States, with such passion and invective. 
 Mr. Chavez, elected a year ago on a promise to strip power from Venezuela's traditional parties and its wealthy elite, has branded critics of the constitution that is to be voted upon Wednesday "degenerates," members of "a rancid oligarchy whose only motherland is capital and profits" and "enemies of the nation." They are, he has charged, "a truckload of squealing pigs" and "a batch of bandits who have betrayed, pillaged and humiliated the people."
For its part, the anti-Chavez camp has sought to link the president to Fidel Castro and Cuban Communism, using Mr. Chavez's own words against him. "I feel happy to follow the path of Fidel," he said during a state visit to Havana last month, adding that Venezuela was swimming "toward the same sea as the Cuban people," which he described as "a sea of happiness, social justice and true peace."
To the alarm of those already suspicious of Mr. Chavez, the new charter, drafted in less than four months by an elected Constitutional Assembly in which his supporters won 90 percent of the seats, would significantly extend the powers of the executive branch of government. It abolishes the Senate, one of the two existing houses of Congress, and gives the president authority to dissolve the legislature in certain specified circumstances. The presidential term of office would expand to six years from five, and Mr. Chavez would be allowed to seek immediate re-election, which is prohibited under the current 1961 Constitution.
In addition, the powers of states and municipalities would be significantly curbed, and the role of the military and its ability to take part in government and politics would increase.
"In many basic respects, this constitution is a step backward from the democratic change the country has been demanding," said Allan Brewer Carias, a prominent lawyer here and an opposition member of the Constitutional Assembly. "It opens the door to authoritarianism, and the authoritarian provisions it contains are certainly going to be used, if not by Chavez, then by someone else."
Even the constitution's main intellectual author has now begun to express doubts about the document. Hermann Escarra, a prominent professor of constitutional law and chairman of the committee that drafted the charter, said he still planned to vote yes in the referendum on Wednesday, joining what opinion polls indicate will be strong support for the document.
But Mr. Escarra describes the final product as "a populist model under military tutelage" and says he will immediately introduce amendments to weaken those tendencies.
Mr. Escarra, who has been one of Mr. Chavez's closest legal advisers, said last week in an interview with the Spanish newspaper La Vanguardia that "the constitution has grave incongruencies" that allow the president "to assume all powers," "give privileges to the military" and put them beyond civilian control. A result, he added, will be a "restricted democracy," and "that would be very disturbing."
Since declaring its independence from Spain in 1811, Venezuela, which has the largest oil reserves outside the Middle East, has had 25 constitutions, more than any other country in South America. Mr. Chavez, striking the kind of sweeping note that has prompted many people here to invest in him their hopes of change, says the new charter will define "the future of Venezuelans for the next 200 years."
Supporters point proudly to the broadened guarantees of individual rights that it offers, including greater recognition of the status of women and indigenous peoples. The charter also reorganizes the country's notoriously corrupt judicial system and includes a recall mechanism that in theory would allow voters to replace elected officials who fail to perform their duties properly.
"This is the most modern and advanced constitution in the entire continent and perhaps in the world," Mr. Chavez said recently on his weekly radio program. He described its passage as essential to "putting 40 years of unfettered corruption and incompetence behind us."
But he has also warned of the prospect of an "internal war" if voters do not approve it.
If the constitution is rejected, "I will do everything possible so that the democratic and peaceful road continues," he said last month. But he added, "I do not know if that will be possible."
A recent poll here found that less than 2 percent of voters in this nation of 23 million people had actually read the draft of the new constitution, a floridly written document that has 350 articles. As a result, the vote seems to have become more of a plebiscite on Mr. Chavez, a cashiered army colonel who led an unsuccessful coup attempt in 1992 but was elected to office with a resounding majority.
"I'm going to vote yes because I want to give the people's president the tools he needs to govern," said Gumersindo Alvarez Montilla, a Chavez supporter who was handing out copies of the document at a subway stop here. "I haven't read all of the constitution, but I don't need to. For me, it is enough that this is Chavez's project, that this is what he wants."
But Mr. Chavez's popularity and the apparent support for his charter have not stopped an informal coalition of political, business, religious and human rights groups from focusing on what they see as dangerous flaws in a document they say was hastily and carelessly drafted.
Human rights groups here and abroad, for instance, have expressed concern about a provision that requires news organizations to publish only "truthful, opportune and impartial" reports. They say the provision would open the door to official censorship and intimidation, since it is unclear who would determine what meets those standards.
Most of Venezuela's main business organizations have come out against the charter. They worry about articles that promise workers a "living" wage without specifying how that would be calculated, prohibit "unjustified" dismissals, reduce the work week and guarantee health care and social security benefits to all Venezuelans, even those who have not contributed to the system, without making clear who will pay that cost.
The Central Bank has taken out full-page newspaper ads to warn that its independence and ability to fight inflation would be sapped by a requirement that it subordinate its policies to those of the government. The president of the state oil company, a Chavez ally, has also complained about provisions that forbid privatization of the company and reserve all "strategic" sectors of the economy for the state.

HEADLINE: G.M. Plans a Rebound From a Bad Month

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Dec. 14

 BODY:
General Motors is having a bad month.
It started Dec. 2 when industry numbers showed that G.M.'s market share had fallen in November to 27.1 percent, a record low for a second consecutive month -- excluding times of strikes or war -- and well below its internal target of 30 percent to 32 percent. It continued when Wall Street analysts turned on the company, saying that the only reason to own G.M. stock is the hope that the company will break itself apart and spin off its Hughes Electronics subsidiary. Then came rumors that America's biggest company would be the subject of a hostile takeover bid. And finally the ultimate insult: some analysts lowered their earnings estimates and suggested investors sell G.M. stock to buy that of its crosstown rival, Ford. 
 "It's been a very tough month," said John A. Casesa, an auto analyst at Merrill Lynch.
G.M.'s executives started saying publicly last week that it is all their fault, but today they made clear that they are relying on existing plans to increase market share as redesigned cars and trucks roll out of factories -- next year. Their apparent lack of urgency is causing Wall Street -- and other automotive companies -- to breathe a sigh of relief because many feared G.M. would panic and start a price war that would crimp profits industrywide.
"You don't address these problems overnight," Harry J. Pearce, G.M.'s vice chairman, said today as he rattled off the sport utility vehicles, heavy-duty pickup trucks and other new vehicles that will soon be in dealer showrooms. "I'm satisfied that the plans we have in place -- if well executed -- will put us in a strong position in the market."
"Clearly we need to improve our market share," said Mr. Pearce, who stressed that G.M.'s executives were to blame for the market share shortcomings. "We all feel responsible for market share -- the senior management group," said Mr. Pearce, tapping his chest. "I'm pointing to myself here -- so do all of us."
All year long, G.M. executives have said the company is selling all it can build. But the November sales results, which were released early this month, showed that G.M. inventory levels were strikingly high, suggesting that a lack of demand, not supply, was the problem.
"We don't have a capacity problem now," explained John F. Smith, Jr., G.M.'s chairman and chief executive, on Monday evening. "Now we've got to sell what we've got, which is our job to do. We're going to work very hard at that."
Mr. Smith called the rumors that G.M. could be the subject of a hostile takeover bid "beyond anything imaginable." Most other industry executives and analysts agree.
To analysts, the drop in market share is G.M.'s biggest problem. "They are in a very urgent situation," said Rod Lache, an analyst at Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown L.L.C. "If the market turns down or they stop growing inventory, their earnings are going to suffer."
Indeed, there is one short-term benefit to G.M. for building more cars than it can quickly sell. Because auto companies record sales when they deliver new vehicles to dealers, G.M.'s fourth-quarter profits will likely be higher than if production had been in closer alignment with customer demand.
But G.M.'s competitors and analysts worry that the large stocks of unsold vehicles will increase pressure on the company to use rebates to move the metal -- rebates that other auto companies would probably be forced to match, hurting industry profits.
"The risk of incentives creeping up is increasing," said Mr. Lache. "G.M. is overstocked."
Investors, meanwhile, are growing impatient with G.M.'s go-slow approach to spinning off part of Hughes. "They should spin off at least a portion of Hughes immediately to assuage the feelings of the stockholder," said Seth Glickenhaus of the money management firm Glickenhaus & Company, which holds millions of G.M. shares.
He also worries that too many G.M. vehicles are failing to turn heads. "The design of some of their cars should be improved," Mr. Glickenhaus said.
To top it all off, G.M.'s low valuation -- its price-to-earnings ratio is 7.2 percent -- is an embarrassment. But G.M. has an explanation for that. too: the Internet economy. "Now the companies that do best are the ones that lose money," Mr. Smith said. "It is a different world."

Did You Evah? What a Swell Partier She Is

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
IT was the morning after yet another impossibly late night for Denise Hale, this one dancing at the St. Regis Hotel. (The nights before that, in reverse order: the Four Seasons, Michael's, La Grenouille, Swifty's, the Knickerbocker Club.)
Mrs. Hale was curled up like a cold cat on a friend's couch, staring mournfully out the window at a barge on the East River and trying to ward off the afternoon, when she would have to "pour what is left of Denise Hale into the airplane" for a trip back home to San Francisco. 
 It was, again, and too soon, the end of what is denoted on certain calendars around New York as Hale Week, an early December society juggernaut that has become as traditional as Christmas or Hanukkah for the rich, powerful, famous, connected or all-of-the-above Manhattan friends of Mrs. Hale, the widow of Prentis Cobb Hale Jr., the department store millionaire.
Nobody has measured the economic benefit to New York City of these visits, but judging by Mrs. Hale's dinner tabs alone, plus the lavish parties her visits generate, it could rank somewhere between Fleet Week and the United States Open.
For her concentric circles of friends -- she counts within the circles Dominick Dunne, Kenneth Jay Lane, Nan Kempner, Clive Davis and Martha Stewart -- the week is a kind of strenuous, year-end social workout and gossip gantlet before everyone flies off to more picturesque holiday retreats around the world. Mrs. Hale makes sure she gets the most out of the week.
"They say it is called Hale Week," she says in her soft Serbian accent reminiscent of Natasha's in the Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoons. "It just sounds like that. It is really called hell week."
She explains: "Everybody knows I am the biggest pain in the you-know-what. I am the first one to say it."
But she adds that despite her reputation for prickliness -- she loves to recite her most valuable party tip, given to her by Elsa Maxwell, the legendary hostess: "My child, be ruthless. You don't ask people just because they're nice" -- she has maintained strong friendships through decades because "I don't play games with you."
"If I say to you, 'You are very nice, and I like you,' I mean it, and I am not going to, after you leave, say to people, 'Oh my God, can you believe this guy?' If I don't like something, you will know it right away."
As if it was not enough simply to explain this, earlier in the day she took the opportunity to demonstrate. After dancing into the little hours at Harry Platt's annual dinner-dance at the St. Regis, Mrs. Hale welcomed a reporter to the apartment where she was staying in New York, owned by Rose Marie Bravo, the chief executive of Burberry.
WHEN the reporter mentioned that he would bring a photographer, she laughed charmingly and said: "Oh, no, my dear. That is not going to happen at all, and it is something which I will not even discuss." She added, "I am a very vain woman."
You will never catch her apologizing for this. It has, after all, been one of her most valuable assets.
Growing up in Belgrade, raised mostly by her father's parents, she was her grandfather's darling. When she was 7, she says, and the Gestapo was looting the city, she was the only one he told of the hiding place for the family's gold.
When she fled her country after the war, in a rowboat, and was plucked from the Adriatic by a British minesweeper, the captain also took a shine to her. He dropped her at a refugee camp in Bari, Italy, instead of shipping her back home.
When she landed a job in Rome modeling, she quickly caught the eye of her first successful husband, a businessman, who took her around the world. (Like many things about her past, she is willfully vague about details. She gives her age as 63. Others name a higher figure.)
And when she divorced him several years later, she soon met her second successful husband, the director Vincente Minnelli. (She left Mr. Minnelli for Mr. Hale, whom she married in 1971.)
Mr. Dunne met her one week after she married Mr. Minnelli in 1960. "Young, beautiful, great jewels," he recalled yesterday. But he soon discovered that she also had a great knack for rattling the sometimes staid Hollywood social scene by giving parties that mixed the elegantly rich and the famously louche.
"There were a couple of the old guard hostesses who were a little put out with her," he said. "But Denise really knew how to play the scene."
It is no stretch to say she still does. She was recently the subject of a spate of gossip columns that said she was having a fling with Don Johnson, the actor. Both say they are just friends.
During Hale week, you could find her one night with the cosmetics entrepreneur Gale Hayman and the next night with hip-hop royalty at an awards ceremony for Mr. Davis.
It is, to say the least, exceedingly strange to hear Mrs. Hale drop names like Puff Daddy and Q-Tip (they come out as Poof Daahhdy and Coo-Teep). But she manages to impart the impression that she first met them back at El Morocco.
"In my country, there is the fairy tale, right?" she says, trying to explain her life. "It says when a child is born there are three fairy godmothers. And they decide what will be the child's destiny."
"My version," she says, "is that my three fairy godmothers were completely plastered."

HEADLINE: A Breakdown on the Sales Lot;
Superdealerships Have Trouble Turning a Profit

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: CANTON, Mich., Dec. 14

 BODY:
The AutoNation operation here looks more like a gigantic Starbucks than a place to sell used cars.
Acres of parking lots marked by color-coded signs surround a large, high-ceilinged building of tan bricks and glass. Inside, instead of battered desks and lots of pushy sales representatives, the office contains curving cubicles of polished wood, with computers to describe the features of every car on the lot. 
 But as heavy sleet turned to snow this morning in this Detroit suburb, a team of liquidation experts poked through the cavernous showroom, trying to determine what could be sold and how quickly, from the cars to the computers. For while AutoNation has succeeded in creating a cheerful, comfortable place to buy used cars, it has failed to do so in a way that would earn money.
Throughout the century-long history of the auto industry, selling cars -- particularly used cars -- has been a gritty business. Profits usually flowed to the hardest-nosed bargainer, the dealer who negotiated the highest possible price for each automobile while spending as little as possible on amenities like furniture, carpeting and salaries.
AutoNation and other big publicly traded companies captured Wall Street's fancy three years ago by trying to change all that. Now they are struggling as the car sales industry is buffeted by the rise of the Internet, a fall in used car prices and a push by traditional dealers to improve customer services.
Some of these new-wave car sales companies built used car superstores that looked like cafes, not junkyards, and employed computer kiosks and child-care centers to lure customers to immense lots that offered as many as 1,000 late-model cars. The same companies, plus a few others, later created big chains of new-car dealerships that would share ad budgets and back-office staff to build national brand names at relatively modest cost.
But now the used car superstores are disappearing almost as fast as they appeared, while the chains' new-car dealerships try to cut costs after sometimes-lavish expansions.
AutoNation's announcement late Monday that it would close most of its used car superstores and cut costs at its headquarters signals the unraveling of that original vision. To some extent, investors had already seen it coming: With the exception of Lithia Motors, the most old-fashioned of the publicly traded auto dealerships, stocks in those chains had already slumped. Since early 1997, price-earnings multiples for the dealer chains have tumbled from as high as 50 to just 8 or 9, as low as the multiples for auto manufacturers.
But the troubles are far from over. "The initial Wall Street projections were so off base that you had this land rush into the industry," said George Hoffer, an economist at Virginia Commonwealth University.
What went wrong? The publicly traded dealership chains appear to have been buffeted by several forces that few anticipated.
Most notably, the Internet has made car buyers more conscious of what constitutes a fair price and better able to check prices without shuttling among dealerships. These informed consumers give dealers with low costs and little overhead the advantage, because they can afford to sell cars at rockbottom prices.
Meanwhile, largely because prices for new cars have leveled off, prices of late-model used cars have fallen recently, hurting the value of the inventories at used car superstores.
Long-maligned traditional dealers also seem to have improved service, partly to match the competition and partly because of pressure from automakers, including some that are experimenting with operating dealerships themselves.
Finally, dealers have used their muscle in state capitals to strengthen franchise laws. Even where the rules have not been tightened, the laws already make it hard for publicly traded dealership companies, automakers and Internet companies to expand their retailing efforts.
Superdealerships, thus, are undergoing a metamorphosis: auto executives are replacing the financiers who built the chains and are moving quickly to reduce costs. In August, Roger Penske, the car dealer and diesel-engine magnate, took control of the United Auto Group, the nation's second-largest dealership chain, from Marshall Cogan, a financier. Michael Jackson, former head of Mercedes-Benz's North American operations, became AutoNation's chief in October, replacing Steven Berrard, a video-rental executive and friend of H. Wayne Huizenga.
It was Mr. Huizenga who conferred Wall Street credibility on the idea that publicly traded corporations could consolidate the auto dealership industry; Mr. Huizenga had already consolidated the garbage-hauling and video-rental businesses, building first Waste Management and then Blockbuster Entertainment. In 1995, Mr. Huizenga took control of Republic Industries, a small garbage hauler, and set about turning it into what is now AutoNation, the world's largest auto retailer.
He was able to buy hundreds of dealerships with his highflying company stock as he reminded investors and analysts of previous successes. "We want to build a brand just like we did at Blockbuster," the company's 1995 annual report said.
But brand-building has proved difficult, partly because the top-performing dealerships AutoNation bought had already built their own reputations based on loyalty to the original owners. And AutoNation was often prevented by state laws from getting extra volume discounts from automakers that might give it a competitive advantage over other dealers, so the company could do little to make up for the higher costs associated with building an empire.
Mr. Jackson is now laying off virtually all 1,800 employees at the 23 used car superstores being closed and dismissing 225 of 600 employees at AutoNation's headquarters in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
Mr. Jackson said he would also sell one of AutoNation's two jets and even look for ways to trim costs at the corporate dining room. "We will create a cost-conscious culture in this company," he said.
But AutoNation, which has 409 dealerships in 19 states and annual sales approaching $20 billion, still has a long way to go. Compare it, for example, with Lithia Motors, essentially a family dealership that has grown into the nation's sixth-biggest publicly traded new car dealership chain with 41 franchises under one corporate umbrella.
Lithia is known for its cheapness. Its corporate headquarters are housed above the parts department of the company's Toyota dealership in Medford, Ore. When an electric motor opens the garage door for the loading dock below, the whir is heard in the offices of the company's top executives. The walls have the original knotty-pine paneling from 1973, and hallways feature exposed pipes.
An executive dining room? "I go to Taco Bell or order in pizza," said Jeff DeBoer, Lithia's vice president of finance. "We order in spaghetti sometimes."
That austerity has been rewarded: Lithia's earnings and stock price have risen even as the stocks of the other big public dealership chains have faltered. Generally speaking, investors have grown disenchanted with the idea of generating rising earnings simply by buying bunches of profitable dealerships.
The only surviving publicly traded chain of used car superstores, out of five two years ago, is CarMax Inc., which is also known for controlling its costs and is 77 percent owned by Circuit City Stores Inc. While Auto Nation said on Monday that its corporate overhead costs had risen 71 percent in the last 12 months, CarMax's overhead has remained flat even as it has slowly expanded, said Austin Ligon, its president.
Mr. Austin attributed AutoNation's problems to excessive growth: "There's a limit to how fast you can do this and still be successful."
AutoNation's rivals have also tried to give considerable autonomy to their dealerships' sales managers, reasoning that every auto market is subtly different and constantly changing. United Auto Group and AutoNation are now moving in the same direction.
Rival dealers say that a lack of feel for local markets hurts the big chains. James Willingham, a Buick, Pontiac and GMC dealer in Long Beach, Calif., said he often drove by an AutoNation used car superstore and was surprised by what was on the lot.
"We see the wrong product," he said. "They're very close to Long Beach University with 30,000 students and they've got big sport utility vehicles, big Cadillacs and Oldsmobiles when they should have Toyotas and Nissans."
AutoNation now sees its future relying to a great extent on the Internet. Two years ago, when it was buying dealerships almost every week, Mr. Berrard said that the company had only begun to work on an Internet strategy. Mr. Jackson now considers the Internet a core part of AutoNation's business, noting in a conference call with analysts and reporters on Monday that customers who first contacted the company through the Internet had bought $1 billion in cars this year.
AutoNation now lists 90,000 cars and their prices on its Web site, www.autonationdirect.com; it has 900 sales agents to handle Internet inquiries. "This is a payoff for economies of scale, because of the single-site advantage to present a wide selection," said Thomas Eggleston, AutoNation's senior vice president for e-commerce.
But while the site offers broad selection, customers are unlikely to buy at dealerships at the other end of the country and wait for delivery.
And for all its size and heft, Auto Nation has found it cannot simply cut margins and try to sell as many cars as possible. The company tried recently in Denver and learned that the automakers' systems for allocating new cars -- another feature of the franchise system -- did not allow dealers to replace cars as fast as they were sold, Mr. Eggleston said. Manufacturers have been leery of shipping so many cars to a single dealer, concerned that the dealer will pursue sales across the franchise territories of other dealers.
The same state franchise laws also make it impossible for AutoNation to start selling new cars at the used car superstores that it is shutting because that would have infringed on the territories of existing dealers.
A few experts have suggested that publicly traded dealership chains join with automakers and Internet companies in a lobbying campaign to overturn the state laws, possibly through Federal legislation.
But traditional dealers are masters not only of low-cost selling but also of using their connections to influence lawmakers. Despite lobbying by automakers, dealers have already persuaded at least five states this year to tighten franchise laws even further. Even as the public dealership companies stagger, traditional dealers are still standing.
"If this were a real fight," said one auto manufacturing executive, "it would have been called."

HEADLINE: Mirror on the Past: Canal's Fate Reflects Shift by U.S.

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: MIRAFLORES LOCKS, Panama, Dec. 14

 BODY:
Millennium celebrations may still be a couple of weeks away, but symbolically the American Century ended here today with a ceremony marking the transfer of the Panama Canal to Panama.
In 1903, nothing compared to Washington's decision to build the canal as a statement of the United States' determination to stand as a world power, even if it meant assisting Panama's secession from Colombia. 
 And while the phrase American Century was actually coined by Henry Luce in 1941, it could have been the motto of President Theodore Roosevelt, who dominated the organizational, medical and engineering tour de force that connected the Atlantic and Pacific.
Ninety-six years later, a festive ceremony noting the imminent turnover reflects the more patient and, above all, more cooperative role in the world the United States now says it seeks.
Out of a late 20th-century sense of sovereignty and respect for somebody else's national pride, a great power is in fact voluntarily giving a piece of valuable national property to a tiny nation with no capacity to seize it.
With the end of the cold war, the venturesome role of presidents like the first Roosevelt or Lyndon Johnson seems to have given way, if not fully to the anti-colonial and anti-imperialist views of Woodrow Wilson, then at least to a sense of the importance of consultation and coalition before bombs are dropped. In Korea and Vietnam, the United States acted first, then looked for allies. In the Persian Gulf and Kosovo, it sought allies first.
Even President Clinton's decision to stay away from the ceremony, though it caused disappointment and even criticism here, meant that the United States would not dominate the day.
That star role was left to President Mireya Moscoso of Panama, who used the occasion to build political bridges by hailing the Panamanian architect of the turnover, the late Gen. Omar Torrijos, even though he seized power by a coup that ousted her late husband from the presidency.
Today's events went without a hitch, except for a soloist who mangled the words to the Star Spangled Banner. But these events were entirely symbolic.
The transfer of canal authority has been going on since the treaty was ratified in 1978, and indeed the final step will not be taken until Dec. 31, with far less hoopla.
President Moscoso and former President Jimmy Carter, leading the United States' delegation, signed a piece of paper in essence promising to keep on implementing the transfer treaty.
But the almost casual American approach to giving away the canal that cost it $352 million and 5,609 lives should not obscure the difficulties Mr. Carter had in winning Senate ratification with only a single vote to spare -- even though then, as now, not a single American aircraft carrier would fit into the canal and nuclear submarines never used it.
Ronald Reagan's rhetoric -- "We bought it. We built it. It's ours and we are going to keep it." -- resonated with Republicans (despite support for the treaty from ex-Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford), and fears of Cuban and Soviet aggression made some votes to ratify into tickets to electoral defeat.
Mr. Carter scoffed today at treaty opponents as "demagogues" and said, "There are still a few of them in my nation today."
But in fact critics of Panama's administration of the canal have made no impact. One longtime foe of the handover, Howard Phillips of the Conservative Caucus, was in Panama today calling for a new treaty to re-establish American bases, and offering to help clean up unexploded ordnance in the jungle in return.
He also demanded that Panama cancel a port-management contract with Hutchison-Whampoa, a worldwide company based in Hong Kong, which he charged would provide a foothold for China to threaten the canal's security.
Most of today's talk was of cooperation. Mrs. Moscoso spoke of efforts to make the canal "a world class enterprise that will permit it to continue offering safe, efficient and competitive service to the international maritime community." Mr. Carter said the United States wanted to be "a full partner, a harmonious partner, an equal partner to answer any request to come from Panama to make the canal even greater in the next millennium."
On most international issues, from global warming to trade to poison gas or atomic bombs, the United States government seeks agreements among many or all nations. It often fails, and frequently does not convince its own people of the need for sacrifice some see in these agreements. But even when it acts unilaterally, as by raising tariffs on some French luxury foods, it follows procedures authorized internationally.
The engineering may have been harder, but the world was a simpler place for Theodore Roosevelt. No one except the Colombians and a few senators, many of whom favored a different canal route, objected to the American help given the Panamanian revolution.
But some things remain the same. The United States could dream of a canal because it was the world's foremost economic power. The huge steel plates for the gates of the Miraflores locks came from Pittsburgh, while the hardware -- bearings, valves, gears and struts -- came from Wheeling, W.Va.
Today the American economy is still the world's greatest.
Nor was boldness the only measure of Roosevelt's foreign policy. In 1905, settling on a new chief engineer for the canal distracted him at least briefly from efforts to mediate the end of the Russo-Japanese war, for which he won the Nobel Peace Prize.
That sort of role has remained a United States value as the American Century ends. President Clinton did not come here today, but he will be trying to help Israel and Syria make peace in Washington on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Once Again, Inflation Is a No-Show

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Despite booming retail sales and strong consumer demand, the Consumer Price Index barely rose in November, the Labor Department reported yesterday. Even gasoline prices did not make their usual contribution to inflation.
Prices rose in a few scattered areas -- like long-distance telephone tolls, airline fares, prescription drugs and housing costs -- but the index, reflecting a great variety of goods and services, was up only 0.1 percent, the smallest increase since June. 
 "There is too much competition and too much deregulation, and as a result companies are finding it virtually impossible to raise prices," said Ed Yardeni, chief economist at Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown, offering an explanation why rising inflation, widely expected on Wall Street, fails month after month to show itself in the numbers.
The weak November inflation number should have sent stock prices soaring, with its suggestion that the Federal Reserve's policy makers will refrain from raising interest rates when they meet next week. Stable prices and interest rates encourage investors to remain in stocks rather than shift to interest-bearing securities.
But instead of focusing on the bland inflation data, investors responded to two other government reports that reflected the economy's strength and for that reason seemed to portend higher interest rates, if not next week then soon enough. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 32.42, to 11,160.17, and interest rates on Treasury securities rose slightly.
The Commerce Department, in one report, said retail sales jumped by a robust 0.9 percent, a result of holiday spending and a surge in auto purchases in a strong economy. In the second report, the nation's current-account deficit, a measure of what Americans owe to foreign lenders, rose in the third quarter to $89.95 billion, up 11.2 percent from the second quarter. Higher interest rates, in Wall Street's view, would cut into these trends by raising the cost of credit. Spending would slow not only for domestic goods but also for imports, the main reason for the rising foreign debt.
While Mr. Yardeni attributed the mild inflation numbers to competition and deregulation -- of the telecommunications industry in the mid-1990's and banks and financial services companies this fall -- others said the stock market might be playing a dual and somewhat contradictory role.
Rising stock prices encourage spending and demand, trends that could in time produce inflationary shortages. But notoriously unprofitable Internet companies are using money raised from investors to subsidize discount pricing. Amazon.com, for instance, floats shares in a rising market, and the money it raises covers huge annual losses. Meanwhile, the company maintains its discount pricing. And the discounts, in turn, keep prices down in bookstores.
Something similar is happening in other industries, says Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo in Minneapolis. "Many people check toy prices on the Internet and ask toy stores to match them," he said. "Or they see the merchandise at a store and go home and buy it for less on the Internet."
Gasoline prices would have fed into the inflation rate, producing a higher price index, if the Bureau of Labor Statistics had continued its price surveys for another week instead of ending them on Nov. 22. The bureau followed its usual practice of shortening the surveys to three weeks from four in November and December, to interfere as little as possible with holiday shopping.
Gasoline prices dipped in late October, and "there was not enough of a rebound by the time we had finished our pricing," said Patrick Jackman, a senior economist in the office that handles the price index. The December report is likely to reflect the rebound, perhaps adding as much as one-tenth of a point.
With energy excluded from the November report, the price index rose only 0.2 percent. That was also the case when both food and energy prices were excluded.
Economists focus on this restricted figure because they consider energy and food prices volatile -- subject to sharp fluctuations that can distort the overall ndex. With those exclusions, the index increased 2.1 percent for the 12 months ending last month. By this measure, the annual inflation rate has fallen from 2.4 percent last year.
The overall index is another matter, rising 2.6 percent over the last 12 months, a full percentage point more than the annual rate as of last December. Rising petroleum prices accounted for all of the increase, particularly as it shows up in gasoline, aircraft fuel and heating oil. Elsewhere, petroleum has not affected the prices of other products yet, although it is a major building block for plastics used in toys and many other products.
Toy makers and others who use plastics may simply be absorbing the higher cost, at the expense of profits, or offsetting the cost through greater productivity -- in effect getting more production from employees for the same wage.
"Productivity would have to rise at an accelerating rate to maintain this balance, and that is questionable," said Richard D. Rippe, chief economist at Prudential Securities.
Despite strong sales last month, the prices of new vehicles were unchanged, on a seasonally adjusted basis, and over the last 12 months they fell 0.3 percent. Apparel costs fell last month, reflecting discounting that usually precedes Christmas. But rents and the cost of owning a home rose -- each by a strong 0.4 percent.
"You have a lot of demand for housing," Mr. Jackman said, "and that is affecting monthly costs."

HEADLINE: Reducing Audits of the Wealthy, I.R.S. Turns Eye on Working Poor

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
The Internal Revenue Service is reducing its efforts to find cheating by businesses and high-income individuals, and stepping up investigations into two forms of cheating that are more likely to involve the working poor than the affluent.
Under pressure from Congress to stress customer service, the I.R.S. is also reassigning employees who had audited companies and high-income individuals to work at counters in walk-in centers, answer telephones around the clock and resolve the tax disputes of estranged couples. 
 But some I.R.S. agents say that many of the changes will tie their hands and in effect shift the focus of audits to those without professional advisers or political connections.
The principal sponsor of legislation overhauling the I.R.S., Senator William V. Roth Jr., the Delaware Republican, said in a statement that the changes taking place were the kind of transitory issues that should be expected when an agency is undergoing a major transformation.
The number of audits in the fiscal year that began this autumn will be cut by 30 percent to 40 percent from the record low number of two years ago, the latest for which data are available, the I.R.S. commissioner, Charles O. Rossotti, said. Fewer than one in 300 tax returns will be audited this fiscal year, down from one in 217 two years ago and one in 63 in 1981. For wealthy individuals with gross income of $100,000 or more, fewer than an estimated one in 150 returns will be audited this year compared to one in 33 in 1992.
The I.R.S. plans to continue giving its highest priority to auditing the 1,600 largest corporations. But it will sharply reduce audits of the other 16 million businesses in America, the vast majority of them privately owned, and of the rapidly increasing ranks of high-income Americans, who tend to file complex returns. The percentage of corporate returns that are audited is expected to fall to just above 1 percent for the current fiscal year from just under 3 percent in 1992.
The effort to find tax cheating is being reduced even more than these numbers suggest, according to more than four dozen I.R.S. employees. In interviews they described pressure from managers to avoid upsetting taxpayers, to overlook complex issues and to close audits quickly. Some agents have coined a term for these once-over-lightly examinations of tax returns: audit lite.
Despite these sharp cuts in personnel to enforce the tax laws, the tax agency is planning a new assault on abuse of the Earned Income Tax Credit, in which the working poor can collect up to $323 for single people and up to $3,556 for a family of four. The credit was created to offset the sharp rise in Social Security tax rates that began two decades ago. Some people make false claims to increase their payment from the government. The credit has been a target of Republican Congressional leaders for the last five years.
The I.R.S. also plans a major new hunt for people who failed to file tax returns. Tax workers said the last such search, early in this decade, focused on people of modest means, and they expect the same this time. The I.R.S. says it intends to focus this search on people who owe substantial amounts.
More than one-fifth of I.R.S. employees, the equivalent of 21,000 people working full time, will be assigned to customer service, up from 12,000 four years ago by one measure and nearly 18,000 by another. By either measure there are thousands fewer workers available to conduct audits and collect overdue taxes.
The tax agency plans one new initiative aimed squarely at the wealthy, an attack on the creation of improper trusts to avoid estate taxes, but this program will not begin until 2001.
Except for the crackdown on abusive trusts, these changes all grow out of a series of new tax laws sponsored by the Republicans who control Congress. The most significant of these laws, the I.R.S. Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998, was passed after Senate Finance Committee hearings in which the I.R.S. was described as out of control and routinely abusive of taxpayers. Much of the most explosive testimony has since been discredited and a subsequent General Accounting Office report found no evidence of systematic mistreatment of taxpayers.
The hearings, the new laws and Mr. Rossotti's policies together have had a profound effect on the agency's employees, especially the low-level managers whose daily decisions determine how the tax laws are administered. Many of these managers have concluded that they are supposed to wilt before the rich and powerful, especially those who can get a politician on the telephone.
"Don't aggravate taxpayers -- that's what our managers are telling us," said one longtime revenue agent in New York. As he spoke six colleagues nodded in agreement and offered similar comments from their bosses.
A revenue agent in Florida said his manager told him: "Don't probe deeply. Just find three or four obvious items and close the case."
An I.R.S. worker in Nashville said anyone there could get a tax case resolved favorably if the taxpayer had enough influence to get a senator or congressman to complain to the I.R.S. "We just collapse," the 14-year veteran said.
"Please don't call us tax collectors in the newspaper," one longtime revenue officer in New York said. "We don't collect taxes anymore. We aren't allowed to."
The chief of I.R.S. operations, John Dalrymple, said "none of these comments shock me."
He was given a synopsis of comments from interviews with I.R.S. workers in California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, New York, Tennessee, Texas and Washington, nearly all of whom spoke on condition that they not be identified.
"I also am hearing things that have the same general tone," he said, adding that he would characterize their comments this way: "Hey, what is the service's policy going to be around compliance and enforcement? And how are we going to balance the need for good customer service on an individual basis with our responsibility to make sure that people are paying their fair share?"
"Frankly, it is a discussion that we have been having at the highest levels of the organization," he said.
Mr. Dalrymple said he and other leading agency executives had traveled the country telling I.R.S. workers that enforcement was important and that all taxpayers were to be treated alike, without regard to their economic or social standing. He said that this message was not getting through and that efforts had failed to stamp out the mistaken belief that policy favored the wealthy.
"Charles and I have been talking about this for quite some time," he said, adding that Mr. Rossotti agreed with him that the only way to change such a widely held belief was for the commissioner to personally make repeated, clear and forceful corrective statements, which he said Mr. Rossotti began doing in May.
"Managers and employees are looking for some definitive statements from Charles about what to do in certain circumstances that are fairly egregious in terms of not complying with the law," Mr. Dalrymple said.
Representative Bill Archer, Republican of Texas, who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said in a statement responding to questions about the changes: "Without question, it will take time for I.R.S. agents who have done things one way for the past 40 years to learn the new approach, which is built on better serving taxpayers."
The emphasis on serving customers, as taxpayers are now called, comes not only from Congress but also from Commissioner Rossotti, a management and computer systems expert who was brought in two years ago to modernize the agency.
Mr. Rossotti has said that for decades the I.R.S. has relied too heavily on audits and on pursuing tax cheats and that the key to increasing tax revenues and maintaining popular support is to help taxpayers meet their obligations through better service delivered by a better-trained staff and improved technology.
In his first and so far only mission statement for the agency, which focused on helping people pay their taxes, Mr. Rossotti made no mention of enforcing the law or collecting taxes, omissions that have been viewed widely within the agency as reflecting a decreased emphasis on enforcement.
But now even Mr. Rossotti is worried that enforcement has slipped too far. He told a Senate subcommittee in October that such a low audit rate "poses the risk of increased unfairness in administration of the law, and, ultimately, undermining our entire system of voluntary tax compliance."
Mr. Rossotti has had to strip down audit units to obey Congressional dictates to expand customer service and resolve a deluge of so-called innocent spouse cases, most of which involve divorced women who say their former husbands cheated on their taxes and left them holding the tax bill. Whole audit teams in Brooklyn, Seattle and elsewhere have been reassigned to innocent spouse cases, and corporate audit teams across the country that once had as many as 12 highly trained examiners have shrunk to as few as 4 people, tax workers said.
Highly trained I.R.S. auditors who are paid up to $77,000 annually to examine corporate tax returns have been detailed to answer telephones and greet people at I.R.S. offices, even though their years of specialized work have left them ill equipped to handle mundane questions from the public. One I.R.S. customer service clerk said these auditors needed so much time to research answers to questions that when she was away, it took five of them to do her job.
Across the country, revenue officers, whose job is to collect taxes past due, said they were having difficulty getting supervisors to approve enforcement actions, like foreclosing on property, because of a perception by managers that they were not to upset customers, even if they are major tax cheats. In the year ended Sept. 30, the I.R.S. seized property 161 times, down from 10,000 two years earlier. Levies on bank accounts and paychecks fell to 504,000 from 3.1 million two years earlier.
Two revenue officers outlined cases they had built against individuals who each cheated the Government out of millions of dollars in taxes, only to be frustrated by the refusal of their superiors to back them up. These officers described elaborate schemes to place assets in the names of relatives to thwart tax collection and, presumably, hide money from creditors. "Every badge of fraud was there, but Criminal Investigation Division told me the U.S. Attorney was not interested," one of these officers said.
The revenue officer said that because the case was rejected for prosecution, requests for permission to force the taxpayer to pay, which Congress now requires be approved by high-level managers, have been ignored. "No one will do anything" to collect the taxes, the officer said.
Mr. Dalrymple said he had heard, fourth or fifth hand, similar tales of inaction and was troubled by them. He said he would like to hear directly from revenue officers who think their superiors are failing in their duty to enforce collection.
The effect of the cuts in audits is amplified by other factors, including a steady rise in the number of tax returns and a very sharp increase in returns filed by high-income Americans, who are the most likely to have income and deductions from businesses and investments, which can involve complex audit issues.
The number of returns reporting an income of $1 million or more jumped to 142,500 in 1997 from 87,000 two years earlier. These returns often include income from businesses the taxpayer controls, capital gains and other sources not subject to the mandatory reporting systems that apply to the forms of income reported by most people, like wages, interest on savings and dividends.
But under tight budgets set by Congress, the full-time I.R.S. staff has shrunk to about 82,000 people, down 14 percent from 1995. When the growing number of tax returns, the increased volume of money and the 1,260 tax code changes that Congress enacted in 1997 and 1998 are taken into account, Mr. Rossotti calculates, the I.R.S. has had its resources cut nearly 29 percent.

HEADLINE: A Perpetual Winner Found Liberation in a Near Failure

SERIES: LOOKING BACK: Bradley vs. Whitman

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 14

 BODY:
It once seemed that the word "failure" was not a part of Bill Bradley's lexicon. He had been a Rhodes scholar, an Olympic gold medalist, a two-time N.B.A. champion and, on his first foray into politics in 1978, the winner of a Senate seat from New Jersey. In 1984, during the Reagan landslide, he won re-election in a walk.
So in 1990, when Mr. Bradley came within three percentage points of losing his once-safe bastion to an unknown, poorly financed Republican named Christine Todd Whitman, he was devastated. For weeks, he wandered the state in a sullen funk, asking friends what had gone wrong. Over coffee, Michael J. Breslin, a Hackensack lawyer, summed it up for him in one word. 
 "I said, 'The public thought you were arrogant,' " Mr. Breslin recalled, referring to voters' anger with Mr. Bradley for not taking a position on a $2.8 billion state tax increase that year. "He looked at me as if he was startled. Because he can't stand arrogant people. I said, 'Nobody's told you that?' And he said, 'No, you're the first guy to mention that word, arrogant.' "
To many of Mr. Bradley's critics and supporters alike, the disastrous 1990 campaign -- both sides use the adjective -- represents the most important event in his political life. Almost no one had expected the race to be close. Mr. Bradley had been widely considered a presidential contender, and he outspent Mrs. Whitman by 12 to 1. Yet he nearly lost.
The election he later called "a terrible blow" shook his confidence in himself and his staff, causing an intense bout of introspection that helped change the course of his career, Mr. Bradley and his friends say.
Within months, he revamped his Washington staff and cut his ties with some of his oldest political advisers. He removed his name from the list of 1992 presidential contenders. His interest in the Senate waned, and he began work on a memoir, "Time Present, Time Past," which eventually consumed more of his time than legislating. By 1995, he had decided to retire, announcing in a now-famous speech that "politics is broken."
After two lucrative years of consulting, teaching and lecturing, Mr. Bradley returned to the political arena as a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination. Yet as much as ever, the 1990 race continues to color his view of politics, and his critics' views of him.
In 1990, Mr. Bradley says, he relied too much on expensive pollsters and consultants who failed to notice the electorate's fury. "The lesson of 1990," he said recently, "is you can have too much money in a campaign."
He says the race also helped him understand the importance of listening more directly to voters, of speaking from his heart and not worrying about the advice of handlers, of being bold. All are lessons he says he has incorporated into his current race, where he has campaigned against conventional politics and made campaign finance reform a central issue.
"He would never be where he is today if not for 1990," said Michael Kaye, Mr. Bradley's media adviser in 1990. "He had to fail. To see that that could happen, and that he could be humiliated. And I think 1990 totally liberated him. He said to himself, 'From this point on, I'm going to do it the way I want to do it.' "
But Republicans say they took a somewhat different lesson from 1990. To them, Mr. Bradley's refusal to distance himself from Gov. Jim Florio's tax plan -- the issue Mrs. Whitman built her campaign around -- simply proved that he was too aloof to understand the anger of average voters and too regimented to adjust when he finally did.
"I was expecting him to blow me out of the water any day, which he could have done with just a couple of sentences distancing himself from that tax hike," said Mrs. Whitman, now in her second term as New Jersey's governor. "But the fact that he didn't became a bigger issue. If you are going to represent the people of New Jersey, you have to respond to their concerns, you have to listen to them. He just never responded."
She added, "The impression I got was that once he locks onto a game plan, he won't change it."
Though Mrs. Whitman entered the Senate race in January 1990, the campaign really began in March, when Mr. Florio, a first-term Democrat, unveiled his plan to close a yawning state budget gap with a $2.8 billion tax increase.
The proposal, coming in the midst of a spreading economic downturn, touched off a storm of protests. Angry homeowners rallied outside the State House, "Impeach Florio" bumper stickers spread like brush fire and radio talk shows devoted hours to railing against the governor.
Even before Mr. Florio released his proposal, Mrs. Whitman's campaign strategists had mapped out a plan for attacking Mr. Bradley as an out-of-touch Washington insider more concerned about global affairs and presidential politics than his home state. The tax plan provided more fodder than they ever had hoped for.
Over the summer, Mrs. Whitman began demanding that Mr. Bradley take a position on the tax increase, which was in the news almost daily as Mr. Florio pushed it through the Legislature. To the delight of the Whitman campaign, Mr. Bradley refused time and time again, saying it was a state issue that had no place in a United States Senate race.
"For this self-styled tax expert to say, 'I have an opinion but I'm not going to say it, I'm not going to tell you,' well, people thought that was unbelievably arrogant," said William Palatucci, a New Jersey lawyer who was Mrs. Whitman's principal political consultant then.
For Mr. Bradley, the tax issue raised some difficult political and personal problems. His aides say he really believed that it was improper for him to weigh in on a state issue, even though he told them privately that he thought the tax increase was "too much, too fast."
But more than that, Mr. Bradley felt deep loyalty to Mr. Florio, who had bucked Democratic Party leaders by supporting Mr. Bradley in 1978 over the state organization's favored Senate candidate.
"Some people said we had to answer these Florio questions," said Bob McHugh, Mr. Bradley's campaign press secretary at the time. "But Bradley just wasn't going to go there."
Moreover, one of Mr. Bradley's closest political advisers, Douglas Berman, his 1984 campaign manager, was Mr. Florio's state treasurer and an architect of the tax increase. It would have been hard for Mr. Bradley to criticize the plan without appearing to repudiate his old friend, now the chief strategist for Mr. Bradley's campaign.
The fact that several relatively inexperienced consultants were running Mr. Bradley's campaign instead of Mr. Berman was an indication to many people that Mr. Bradley was not worried about Mrs. Whitman.
Nicholas Donatiello Jr., Mr. Bradley's 30-year-old Senate press secretary, was the manager, though he had never run a campaign before. Mr. Kaye, the media consultant, spent much of the year in Santa Fe, N.M., and Los Angeles. And Joseph Peritz, the pollster, was a specialist in consumer products.
"This was not a campaign people were anxious to run, because expectations were sky high," Mr. Donatiello said in a recent interview. "You couldn't beat them."
Many of Mr. Bradley's friends also say he seemed to be more interested in the 1992 presidential campaign than in his re-election. Leading up to the 1990 campaign, he had spent $1 million polling voters around the country and buying computer equipment to analyze the data. He also raised much of his $12 million Senate war chest outside of New Jersey, particularly in California, an indication that he was trying to create a national base of supporters.
All of those things fit neatly into Mrs. Whitman's line of attack. Yet by the fall, polls showed Mr. Bradley still leading by 20 points or more. So his advisers maintained their cautious strategy of refusing to engage Mrs. Whitman and running positive advertisements about Mr. Bradley.
But even those commercials seemed to fall flat. One spot featured Mr. Bradley in his Senate office, kicking his sneaker-clad feet up onto his desk; another showed him sinking a basketball shot before cheering students. In both cases, the commercials seemed oddly out of sync with the bad mood of the electorate.
"It looked frivolous," Mr. Kaye said recently.
Mr. Bradley also often seemed slow or ineffective at responding to Mrs. Whitman's repeated thrusts on issues, ranging from his campaign contributions to his environmental record. When she challenged him to take a position on flag burning, he spent two weeks studying the matter before announcing that he considered it a constitutional right.
By the last two weeks of the campaign, Mr. Bradley, who had been in Washington for Senate votes much of the fall, finally returned home for full-time campaigning. For the first time, he heard voters' anger in person. Soon after, his campaign ran its first negative ad against Mrs. Whitman, accusing her of supporting higher taxes as a Somerset County freeholder. He defended the ad with a line he still uses, "Get an elbow, give an elbow."
By and large, however, Mr. Bradley did little to alter his strategy down the stretch. Yet more and more voters were switching their allegiances to Mrs. Whitman every day, and Mr. Bradley had no knowledge of it. His campaign had stopped doing tracking polls in October, confident that his big lead would hold.
"It was amazing, but no one smelled the coffee," Mr. McHugh said.
After the election, Mr. Bradley became withdrawn, his friends and former aides say. He blamed his advisers, himself and even voters.
"For many months to come," he wrote in "Time Present, Time Past" (Knopf, 1996), "I looked at each person who approached me as if he or she had voted against me."
Gradually, as his disappointment lifted, he came to look at the 1990 election as "the best thing that ever happened in my political career," he wrote. "It forced me to face up to what I needed to change, both organizationally and personally. It forced me to go deeper into my emotions and to speak from values and convictions in ways I had avoided before."
Mr. Bradley's friends say they think Mr. Bradley has become more playful and unbuttoned as a result of 1990, doing little things like grabbing the glasses off Larry King's face or asking Sam Donaldson whether he ever smoked marijuana.
But some also wonder whether he completely understands what happened in 1990 and whether he has accepted his own role in his poor showing.
"He felt betrayed," one friend said. "And he blamed everyone. He saw how vulnerable he was to people giving him advice. I felt bad for him because I saw how wounded he was. But in the end, he's the boss. They gave him bad advice, but he's the one who took it."

HEADLINE: House Panel to Question Democratic Fund-Raiser

BYLINE: By DAVID JOHNSTON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 14

 BODY:
After years of investigations, partisan vitriol and accusations of stonewalling leveled at the Clinton White House, Republicans in Congress will at last get what they have long sought, a hearing on Wednesday to publicly question a Democratic fund-raiser at the epicenter of the 1996 campaign fund-raising controversy: John Huang.
Protected by a grant of immunity, Mr. Huang is scheduled to begin three days of testimony before the House Government Reform Committee led by its Republican chairman, Representative Dan Burton of Indiana -- an event that Republicans hope will prove uncomfortable for President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore. 
 Republicans may be disappointed. In Mr. Huang's opening statement, a copy of which was provided to The New York Times, the former fund-raiser said he knew of no wrongdoing by either Mr. Clinton or Mr. Gore. Mr. Huang said he might have escaped "the terrible ordeal" had he implicated them, but, he said: "I never had a basis upon which to do so. In fact, I maintain very high regard for each of these dedicated men."
In August, Mr. Huang pleaded guilty to engaging in a conspiracy to defraud the Federal Election Commission by arranging for employees of the Lippo Group, an Indonesian-based conglomerate run by the powerful Riady family, to be reimbursed for contributions in the 1992 and the 1994 elections. He was sentenced to probation and agreed to cooperate with the federal authorities.
Mr. Huang played a significant role in the 1996 campaign. Of the $2.8 million in improper contributions that the Democrats were forced to return after the 1996 election, almost 80 percent were raised by Mr. Huang and Yah Lin Trie, both of whom were longtime friends of Mr. Clinton and raised large sums based on their personal relationships with the president. In 1997, when the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee began its investigation, Mr. Huang refused to testify, invoking his constitutional right against self-incrimination.
Today, White House officials repeated their frequently expressed skepticism about the objectivity of Mr. Burton's panel and questioned its impartiality in questioning Mr. Huang. Jim Kennedy, a White House spokesman, said: "Three things in life are certain. Death, taxes and partisan hearings chaired by Dan Burton."
But Mr. Huang's testimony -- re-examining the frenzy of Democratic fund-raising in 1996 -- comes at a time when campaign finance issues seem to be catching fire in the presidential race and could help sharpen demands for changes in the country's system of raising money for federal candidates and parties.
Those demands are already central issues for insurgent presidential candidates like Bill Bradley, the former Democratic senator from New Jersey, and John McCain, the Republican senator from Arizona. In an unusual step, Mr. Bradley and Mr. McCain have scheduled a joint appearance on Thursday in New Hampshire to pledge that if nominated they would call on their parties to refuse unrestricted "soft money" contributions for party-building activities. Many of the large contributions raised by Mr. Huang in 1996 flowed into the Democratic National Committee in soft-money checks.
In his written testimony, Mr. Huang does not suggest that he will add important new details to his activities, which have been the subject of lengthy Senate, House and Justice Department investigations. Last month, Mr. Burton's committee released lengthy notes taken by F.B.I. agents in their investigation of campaign finance matters.
Instead, in his prepared remarks, Mr. Huang, who once worked at the Commerce Department and later at the Democratic National Committee, portrayed himself as a victim of partisan politics, a rising tide of anti-Asian sentiment and grossly unfair news accounts, including reports of lawmakers who falsely accused him of economic espionage. "People seeking publicity have lied about me repeatedly in the press and even before this committee without consequence."
But he admitted that he had made mistakes. "Embarrassed and saddened though I am by the unfortunate attention my conduct and notoriety brought upon my community, the dated and isolated offenses, which I have openly acknowledged, will not deter me from my career-long efforts to promote understanding between the citizens of the United States and those of China, Taiwan and the rest of Asia."
Investigations have found that Mr. Huang first met Mr. Clinton in the 1980's, through a mutual friend, James Riady, the head of the Lippo Group. By 1992, when Mr. Huang was employed by the Lippo Bank in California, he began to raise money for the Democratic Party.
After Mr. Clinton's election, Mr. Huang used his contacts to get a job at the Commerce Department. In 1995, as the president's re-election campaign began, Mr. Huang left Commerce to begin fund-raising for the Democrats, although some party officials had reservations from the start about whether Mr. Huang might be raising money from contributors overseas.
Throughout 1996, Mr. Huang organized fund-raising events, some attended by foreign contributors and Mr. Clinton. Mr. Huang and another fund-raiser, Maria Hsia, organized one such event on April 29, 1997, at the Hsi Lai temple in Hacienda Heights, Calif., which was attended by Mr. Gore, whose shifting statements about his knowledge of the purpose of the event dogged the vice president for many months.

HEADLINE: McCain Unveils HealthPlan Calling for Modest Changes

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: CHARLESTON, S.C., Dec. 14

 BODY:
Calling the nation's health care system "too costly, too inaccessible and too bureaucratic," Senator John McCain today set out a plan of "tailored reforms" that included a federal program to help the low-income elderly pay for prescription drugs and a limited right to sue health maintenance organizations.
Mr. McCain's plan, offered in a speech to the Charleston Rotary Club, was part of an effort to capitalize on his surge in New Hampshire by fleshing out his positions on issues. Health care -- and most particularly the soaring costs of prescription drugs -- has emerged as one of the hottest topics on the campaign trail this year, and until now it has been a policy arena largely dominated by the Democrats. 
 "Our health care system today often fails to reflect our values," Mr. McCain, an Arizona Republican, said, as he began two days of campaigning in one of the crucial early primary states where he is hoping to upset the Republican front-runner, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. "Too many Americans go to sleep at night desperately fearing illness or injury to themselves or a family member because they are without health insurance to pay their bills."
But even while he identified access to affordable, quality health care as one of the most pressing problems facing American families, Mr. McCain stopped well short of the kinds of more far-reaching legislation that Vice President Al Gore, former Senator Bill Bradley and Congressional Democrats are running on. Aides were still calculating the cost of his program hours after his program. Tonight they said the entire health care plan would cost $7.6 billion when fully in effect in its fifth year.
Mr. McCain's plan for regulating health maintenance organizations would extend a limited right to sue to people in managed health care plans regulated by the federal government. But that would not include suits for punitive damages. His prescription drug plan would offer federal money to states that chose to participate and match the amounts instead of making it a new benefit for all Medicare recipients.
He proposed nothing resembling Mr. Bradley's plan for subsidies and tax credits for children and affordable coverage for adults through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program.
"Getting there does not require some grand experiment in social engineering," Mr. McCain said, "or a death-by-a-thousand-cuts, gradual government takeover of the health care system. We need only to consult our values and enact tailored reforms that build on the strengths of the current system."
Mr. McCain's effort to find an ideological middle ground was most clear in his proposal for reducing the spiraling costs of prescription drugs to the elderly. Unlike President Clinton's plan for a broad expansion of the Medicare program at a cost of $118 billion to the federal government, Mr. McCain called for a block grant that would cost the government only $5.1 billion when fully in place in its fifth year, matched by those states that chose to participate in the program. Currently, 14 states provide drug cost aid to the elderly.
Mr. Gore and Mr. Bradley both have proposed a Medicare benefit for prescription drugs.
Although Medicaid covers most prescription drug costs for the elderly poor, Mr. McCain's aides said his plan would help an estimated 10 million of the near-poor elderly with incomes of up to two times the poverty level of $8,240 for an individual and $11,060 per couple.
Mr. McCain also said that he would create regional pilot projects costing $1 billion a year when fully implemented to test programs of assistance to the elderly regardless of income when they face catastrophic drug costs "that can cruelly snatch away a life's savings."
The speech gave Mr. McCain a new opportunity to tie his signature issue -- the overhaul of the campaign finance laws -- to broader social concerns.
"Taking the $100,000 special interest checks out of politics is the gateway through which all other reforms including the reform of our health care system must pass," he said.
He blamed both parties' fidelity to special interests for Congressional gridlock on regulating managed care, saying: "Republicans want to protect the insurance companies from lawsuits. The Democrats want to let the trial lawyers sue anyone for anything."
Mr. McCain found a middle ground, calling for more protections than Republican legislation that passed the Senate, but stopping short of the right to sue contained in a bipartisan bill that the House passed.
At a news conference later, Mr. McCain said he would like to see independent state panels set up to review cases when consumers were denied care by a health maintenance organization. His aides said that under his proposal the 48 million Americans in the managed care plans that fall under federal regulation would be given a somewhat broader right to sue than they now have, if they were unsatisfied with the review. Those in such federally regulated managed care plans now are allowed to sue only for the cost of denied medical care.
They would be barred from receiving punitive damages. But they would be allowed to seek unlimited damages for economic suffering like lost wages. Dan Schnur, the senator's communications director, said Mr. McCain would also propose legislation to put a $250,000 cap on noneconomic damages, like awards for pain and suffering.
When the Senate debated managed care regulation this year, Mr. McCain voted for the Republican bill, which did not include an expanded right to sue. His aides said he had supported the legislation because he did not want to see the issue die in the Senate.
To extend health insurance coverage to more of the nation's 44 million uninsured, Mr. McCain like many Republicans called for an expansion of medical savings accounts, tax-free accounts that could be used to cover medical costs, and for a more general tax reduction to give people more money to buy insurance. He also called for a more aggressive effort to encourage small businesses to band together in insurance purchasing pools, as well as a greater effort to enroll children in a federal program established two years ago for children in families not poor enough for Medicaid but not affluent enough to buy private insurance. Mr. McCain also called for increased spending on veterans' health care programs.
Mr. McCain's speech made him the first Republican to set out a detailed health care plan. Mr. Bush has spoken only generally of extending coverage and pointed to the program in Texas for regulating H.M.O.'s.
The issue has been more hotly debated in the Democratic presidential contest because of Mr. Bradley's call for a vast system of subsidies and tax credits that would cost $65 billion a year. Mr. Gore has aggressively picked apart the plan.

HEADLINE: GERMANS TO SET UP $5.1 BILLION FUND FOR NAZIS' SLAVES

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: BERLIN, Dec. 14

 BODY:
After months of bitter negotiations, German industry and government officials agreed today to establish a fund of $5.1 billion to compensate people who were slave laborers during the Nazi regime.
Although important details were still being negotiated, people on both sides of the negotiations said tonight that they had reached an agreement on the central question, to raise the amount of money that had been proposed. They settled the figure at 10 billion marks. 
 The scope of the effort could ultimately affect more than one million surviving victims of Nazi Germany's systematic use of forced labor, although nobody is sure how many people may ultimately file claims.
American officials estimate that there are 240,000 surviving slave laborers, about half Jewish, who were held in concentration camps and forced to work under nightmarish conditions.
The fund would also compensate a much larger number of "forced" laborers, most of whom were not Jewish and were brought from the Soviet Union, Poland and other East European countries.
Officials estimate that group at 700,000 to 1.5 million.
Although fewer than 100,000 of the former forced workers are Americans, the negotiations were driven almost entirely by American class-action lawyers and Jewish groups, as well as the United States government.
German executives have been worried about the suits, but even more by the prospect of a conflict with American customers and business partners. American and German officials said they hoped to finish negotiating the main elements of the plan on Friday in Berlin. German corporations would pay at least half the money for the new humanitarian fund and the German government the rest.
American companies with German subsidiaries, including General Motors and Ford, are also expected to participate.
In principle, the fund could provide up to $7,500 for each surviving slave laborer, and most likely smaller amounts for forced laborers.
But lawyers involved in the talks predicted bruising disputes about the rules on how former workers would qualify for the payments.
"We have an agreement, there is absolutely no doubt about that," said Michael Witti, a lawyer in Munich for former workers. "But anybody who thinks this will all go through smoothly is living in a dream world."
Although three-quarters of the money from the fund would compensate forced workers, the settlement is also intended to resolve other open claims arising from the Nazi era. The fund would also be used to compensate Jewish victims of so-called "Aryanization" programs, Jews and other non-Germans who were forced by the Nazis to sell their property at fire-sale prices.
And the fund would be used to handle lingering claims against insurance companies.
The deal was reached after marathon bargaining over the telephone among Jewish groups, American lawyers, German industry and the German government.
It was mediated by Stuart Eizenstat, the United States deputy treasury secretary, and Otto Lambsdorff, a former economics minister in West Germany. The two men are to arrive in Berlin on Friday to work out final details and formally announce an agreement.
In exchange for paying the fund, German companies like DaimlerChrysler, Siemens and Volkswagen would receive immunity from future lawsuits over the use of forced labor. German banks would be freed from claims arising from the "Aryanization programs."
All companies would give money to a common fund set up by an independent German foundation, which would transfer money to designated organizations that represent surviving workers in the United States, as well as in Central and Eastern Europe.
"I can confirm that an agreement has been reached," said a spokesman for the German industry foundation, Wolfgang Gibowski. "I hope that the money will come relatively quickly to the surviving victims."
Part of the total compensation will probably come from American companies with German subsidiaries that used forced labor in the war. The most notable of those are likely to be Adam Opel, a company that General Motors bought more than 70 years ago.
Both companies have long acknowledged that their German factories used forced laborers in the war, but had argued that they had no liability because the Nazi government took over the businesses.
Lawyers for the former workers, who stand to make many millions of dollars in fees from the settlement, said they thought the German government would provide some of the money being added to bring the settlement to 10 billion marks.
Lawyers for the former workers had sought 20 billion marks.
German negotiators, as well as Chancellor Gerhard Schroder, had insisted as recently as last week that there would be no money beyond the 8 billion marks proposed last month.
Today, advocates for former workers said they were satisfied.
"This is a measure of justice for slave laborers who have waited a very long time," said Gideon Taylor, executive vice president of the Jewish Conference on Material Claims Against Germany.
The group has been collecting and distributing money from Germany on behalf of forced workers for several decades.
In a telephone interview, Mr. Eizenstat was optimistic that there would be a definitive acceptance of the 10 billion mark figure, but he cautioned that the German government had yet to accept the plan officially.
"It would be a wonderful way for Germany to make a moral statement at the end of the century that would have lasting effects into the next century," he said of the emerging terms.
Mr. Eizenstat is to meet Mr. Lambsdorff in Berlin on Thursday and Friday in the hope of wrapping up the details, according to Susan Elbow, a spokeswoman for Mr. Eizenstat.
Melvyn Weiss, an American class-action lawyer, said he was unhappy about accepting 10 billion marks, but felt he had no choice.
"I don't feel good about it," Mr. Weiss said. "But it is a pragmatic decision. At this point, we don't have a choice because of the needs of aging victims and the pressure from governments to get this resolved."

HEADLINE: THE TRANSIT SHOWDOWN: THE BENCH MARKS;
At 14.3 Percent Over 3 Years Raise for Transit Workers Beats the Average

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

 BODY:
The agreement struck this morning with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority will give transit workers a 14.3 percent increase in wages and benefits over three years, union officials said, an increase that generally eclipses raises for public employees in the New York region in recent years.
In typical fashion, the city transit workers began the negotiations by making a high-end demand of 9 percent annual wage increases, or a 27 percent total raise over a three-year contract. In equally typical fashion, the M.T.A., which runs the city's subways and buses, started out with a low-ball offer of less than 2.4 percent annual wage increases over four years. The average transit worker makes $39,000. 
 But deals reached earlier this year between the M.T.A. and workers on the Long Island Rail Road and the Metro-North Railroad, and between the Pataki administration and state university professors and administrators, resulted in wage increases ranging from 3 to 4 percent a year.
The railroad workers accepted a deal that will pay them an 11 percent total raise over three years, or 3.67 percent per year. In September, state university employees agreed to a deal that pays them 3 percent annual raises for four years, along with bonuses and health and insurance benefits that bring the increase in total annual compensation to more than that. The average SUNY employee makes $53,500 a year.
Three years ago, the transit union accepted a total wage increase of only 3.75 percent over three years because the M.T.A. faced a large deficit at the time.
With the M.T.A.'s finances now in far better shape, Willie James, the president of Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union, had argued that larger raises were in order. He also pointed to recent raises for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and other top elected officials. "The mayor gave himself and other officials a 28 percent raise," he said. "So, I don't see why he says it's unreasonable for me to ask 27 percent for the members when they've done so much to increase productivity."
Nationwide, from September 1998 to September 1999, wages for state and local government workers rose 3.3 percent and benefits rose 2 percent, an increase in total compensation of 2.9 percent, according to the federal Labor Department.
The federal figures, reflected in the Employment Cost Index, also show that since 1994, local and state government employees have received average annual wage increases of just under 3 percent and average annual benefits increases of 2.3 percent, for a average annual increase of 2.8 percent in total compensation. Raises have tended to be larger in recent years, as the economy strengthened.
In the early years of the Giuliani administration, when the city's economy was weaker, the city's uniformed employees, including police officers, supervisors and correction officers, agreed to two years of wage freezes followed by two annual increases of 3 percent and an increase of 6 percent in the final year of their five-year contracts.

HEADLINE: France Halts U.N. Debate On Monitors For Iraqi Arms

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 14

 BODY:
Hours before the Security Council was to vote today on a new arms-inspection system for Iraq, France suddenly asked to stop the clock, stunning council members and irritating some by calling for more talks on a resolution that had been under discussion for more than six months.
A United Nations official described the move as tragic, coming as it did just after Russia's deputy representative here, Gennadi Gatilov, told reporters that Russia would abstain, thereby removing the threat of veto from a measure that could send arms inspectors back to Iraq for the first time in a year. 
 No new date was set for a vote.
"This is not about the resolution," one diplomat said, adding that France appeared unable to take a stand that might damage its relations with Iraq.
"People are very irritated, very angry that France is prolonging this needlessly," the diplomat said. Another envoy said the council was being held hostage to "domestic French politics."
Iraq, which demands that a nine-year-old embargo be lifted before inspections begin, threatened France last week with a diplomatic break and the loss of oil contracts if France supported the resolution.
The French decision was conveyed late in the day in London to the British, the sponsor of the resolution setting up the new inspection commission. Britain also holds the presidency of the Security Council this month.
The British and Americans offered no explanation why they acquiesced to the French, after insisting for the past week that the resolution was ready for a vote and that there would be no further negotiations. Richard C. Holbrooke, the chief United States representative, has not been involved in the talks, saying he had other pressing affairs.
The new inspection plan has been fine-tuned several times to take Russian and French concerns into account, including the addition of provisions that arms control experts say could reduce the monitors' independence.
Today Secretary General Kofi Annan appeared to confirm these apprehensions when he told reporters that the United Nations disarmament department would help him draw up a list of staff members for the new commission. Arms experts say that should be left to the commission's executive chairman, who is to be chosen by Mr. Annan.
The unexpected council setback on Iraq came as the International Atomic Energy Agency, which is responsible for all nuclear inspections in Iraq, was also meeting resistance in Baghdad as it tried to carry out monitoring unrelated to any United Nations inspections.
The agency said that if Iraq did not allow inspectors to check stores of low-enriched uranium this week, President Saddam Hussein would again be in violation of the 1968 nuclear nonproliferation treaty. Iraq violated the treaty consistently before the gulf war in 1991, but those violations were not discovered until after the war, when clandestine caches of highly enriched uranium and plutonium were removed from the country by United Nations inspectors.
This week the agency assembled a team to make a routine annual inspection of Iraq's permitted uranium stocks, which must be regularly monitored, said David Kyd, a spokesman for the agency. But Iraq has not issued them visas.
Although the Clinton administration has said it does not have proof that the Iraqis have resumed building prohibited weapons -- nuclear, biological or chemical -- independent disarmament experts say that given a year without international inspections, it is more than likely that Iraq has continued to look for ways to reconstruct programs.
No atomic agency inspectors have been permitted to work in Iraq since they and the United Nations team, which monitored biological, chemical and missile systems, were evacuated just before American and British air strikes resumed a year ago this week.
Mr. Kyd said that under the nuclear nonproliferation treaty, which Iraq signed, the atomic energy agency is required to keep track of 1.8 tons of low-enriched uranium and other stocks of natural uranium in Iraq's possession.
At the Nuclear Control Institute, an independent organization in Washington, Paul L. Leventhal, the president, said that the 1.8 tons had already been enriched to 2.3 percent or 3 percent and could be used to create bomb-grade uranium "if they had a clandestine centrifuge enrichment plant -- which, by the way, no one is ruling out."
"That is, of course, the technology they were working on when the whole program was stopped by the gulf war," he said.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 17, 1999, Friday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Wednesday about a delay in the Security Council's vote on a resolution renewing arms inspections of Iraq misstated the degree to which the country is said to have enriched a supply of uranium. According to David Kyd, a spokesman for the International Atomic Energy Agency, it is 2.6 percent, not 2.3 or 3 percent.
Also because of an editing error, the article referred incorrectly to a comment by Paul L. Leventhal, president of the Nuclear Control Institute, an independent organization in Washington. He said that uranium enriched to 3 percent from 2.3 could be used to create bomb-grade uranium. He did not say that an Iraqi supply of 1.8 tons of uranium had been enriched to 2.3 or 3 percent.
The headline on the article misstated France's action. France did not halt debate on the resolution; it delayed a vote.
Because of another editing error, an article yesterday about Iraq's refusal to admit inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency misstated the year the United Nations imposed economic sanctions on the country. It was 1990, after Iraq invaded Kuwait -- not 1991, the year of the Persian Gulf war.

HEADLINE: Shaping Cities, Pixels to Bricks

BYLINE: By NINA TEICHOLZ 

 BODY:
MIKE ROSEN, an architect, first glimpsed the future of his profession in an unlikely spot -- the video game arcade at a nightclub. At the time, Mr. Rosen, who is the head of his own firm in Philadelphia, was having trouble getting local approval for a planned community he had designed in Chester County, Pa.
The problem was on his mind at the nightclub as he donned a virtual-reality helmet to play the game Virtuosity, hunting pterodactyls in a spare geometric environment. "I thought, this is a perfect visualization tool for architects," he recalls. 
 Mr. Rosen is part of a small cadre of architects who create three-dimensional models of cities on computer screens, a technique called urban simulation. It takes state-of-the-art virtual reality techniques, many of them borrowed from military flight simulation technology, and applies them to the basic business of urban planning.
The results are virtual cities: digital, three-dimensional models of cities like Los Angeles, Washington, New York and New Orleans. Mr. Rosen built a model of Philadelphia. "People can't read architectural drawings and they can't relate to models," Mr. Rosen said. "But I realized they found virtual-reality technology cool and that maybe I could relate to clients that way."
Some of the models are extremely detailed: a model of Los Angeles created by Bill Jepson, director of the Urban Simulation Laboratory at the University California at Los Angeles, is accurate down to the graffiti on the buildings and the signs in store windows.
Depending on the sophistication of the program, viewers can navigate through these models as they would through a video game, flying over buildings, spinning 360 degrees and even changing features of the landscape with a mouse click. Some of the models are also "smart," that is, connected to a database. If you click on a building, you can get information on the building's owner, the principal tenants, even the current cost for each square foot.
These models are already changing the way real estate developers do business, said Michael Kwartler, director of the Environmental Simulation Center in Manhattan. For example, he built a three-dimensional model of a SoHo neighborhood for a developer seeking to build a hotel there. "We showed the model to the community, let them fly around it and look at things from different angles," Mr. Kwartler said, "and we sailed through the public hearing. After all, it's much easier to do urban planning by consensus than by injunction."
In the not-so-distant future, the models should be so sophisticated that you could wander through the virtual streets looking for that little Italian restaurant you visited years ago, recognize the window display and click on it to look at the menu or perhaps make a reservation. Police and fire departments will probably be able to set up virtual command centers in virtual cities; critical information like floor plans and the locations of fire hydrants and hose bibs could be updated easily.
"This isn't just in the realm of imagination," Mr. Jepson said. "We're pushing hard to develop these emergency response applications."
Mr. Jepson's laboratory is also building a virtual version of ancient Rome. The purpose is primarily educational: faculty and students could meet as avatars on Roman soil and perhaps get a history lesson from an actor playing Julius Caesar.
Two people looking at the same blueprint may imagine the object in radically different ways.
"Architects typically get fired in the middle of projects," said Joel Orr, an urban simulation consultant, "usually because the owner and architect think they have a shared assumption about how something will look, which is not true." Virtual tools, he added, "permit a far greater opening of communication channels between humans than has ever before been possible."
The first city to be simulated was an imaginary one, created at U.C.L.A. in the 1970's. NASA had given the school a grant to develop applications for the technology used to simulate the Apollo moon missions. Until modeling became common in the industry, architects would slide video cameras through physical models to try to capture the pedestrian perspective. The heat of the lights caused all the photographs to peel off the little model buildings, said a clearly un-nostalgic Mr. Kwartler.
Today, urban simulation technology is so persuasive that the National Capital Planning Commission now requires architects to submit three-dimensional computer models of all proposed projects on Washington public land. These projects are then integrated into the citywide model. "It allows us to control what we're going to see as opposed to what the applicant wants us to see," said Michael Sherman, a community planner for the commission.
Mr. Sherman used the example of the proposed World War II memorial on the Washington Mall: "We were able to evaluate the impact much earlier on. We could see whether the views of the Lincoln Memorial and other historical landmarks were blocked. It was very helpful to see the memorial from the perspective of a pedestrian, which you can't do with a physical model."
The basic tools for urban simulation are now within the reach of most architects. While more photorealistic modeling still demands a high-end Unix station costing at least $15,000, many architects can do less sophisticated work on a Pentium-class PC with a $300 graphics card. Software is more expensive. The programs for building a 3-D world (for example, Viz by Autodesk, MicroStation by Bentley Systems and Creator by MultiGen-Paradigm) and for real-time simulation (like Vega and GameGen by MultiGen-Paradigm) add up to about $15,000.
That money can save on costly construction fiascos. Before ground was ever broken on the mammoth Bellagio hotel in Las Vegas, for example, the developer made hundreds of changes based on reactions to the virtual model. In Philadelphia, developers of a new baseball stadium for the Phillies averted a minor disaster by consulting a virtual model built by Mr. Rosen.
"When we built the model and got down onto the field and looked toward the sky, we realized that the huge scoreboard hid a piece of the city skyline," Mr. Rosen said. So he moved the stadium over 40 feet and rotated it so that the developers had the design and view they wanted. "There was no other way to visualize that problem until the stadium was built," he said. "By then it would have been too late."
Virtual modeling is also aiding in the laborious search for rooftop or office space. When Chase Manhattan Bank was looking for 20,000 square feet of space recently, it went to Urban Data Solutions, a firm that has built a model, accurate to within a meter, of most of New York City. Telecommunication companies have hired Urban Data to scout out rooftop locations for their antennas and receivers. Standing atop any virtual building, a viewer can see if other buildings will block signal sight lines. Andrew Lerner, president of Urban Data, said he planned to use his model for emergency personnel training and maybe even for virtual backdrops for movies.
Some of the field's most innovative work is being done by New York's Environment Simulation Center. Mr. Kwartler has developed modeling software that works on a Pentium-class PC with an inexpensive graphics card, thereby enabling communities to do planning on their own. The software is like a 19th-century pattern book, with a kit of parts -- houses, garages, trees, streets -- that a town planner can use to paste together various development schemes. Each element is "smart," so when a new set of houses is placed on a street, the software immediately calculates the additional tax revenue versus the new cost of road and utility maintenance.
The model can even make sophisticated predictions about outcomes. Build an upscale mall in your town, for example, and the software will project what kinds of people might shop there, how much money the mall might generate, and so on. Build a low-end mall, and the model will assume that some nearby homeowners would move out of town.
"It creates a kind of accountability," Mr. Kwartler said. "You can't be seduced by someone's perhaps overly optimistic vision."
The town Mr. Kwartler has modeled most extensively is Ascutney, Vt., (population: 1,000), which is considering several ways to develop its tiny downtown. Mr. Kwartler's group presented its simulated models during the summer. "It was like someone flipped on a light switch in the room," said Gary Smith, a consultant who is gathering data for the project. "People who would barely talk to each other because they couldn't agree on where to build new roads suddenly had at least a willingness to explore more."
For the architects and developers accustomed to controlling what people see, these advances can be threatening. "Normally, an architect goes to a meeting with three drawings -- each of them a very manipulative view that's favorable to the developer," Mr. Kwartler said. But modeling technology levels the playing field; a client can visualize just as well as an architect. "Architects find this technology very uncomfortable," said Mr. Sherman at the National Capital Planning Commission. "We're running into a lot of resistance because they don't want to give the government their 3-D files. They don't want to lose control of what's seen."
Other critics say computer models fail to capture the tactile quality of a development landscape. "I get the criticism we even make all the ugly stuff look good," Mr. Kwartler said. The limited power behind most models means that they can't show every gritty detail -- cabs honking, trash cans overflowing, power lines. "If you saw a model I did of Chinatown," Mr. Kwartler said, "absent all its hustle and bustle, and then you went to the real place, you'd be totally shocked."
Mr. Rosen blames high expectations among viewers of the technology for some of the criticism. "They've come to want the photorealism of 'Toy Story' and 'Jurassic Park,' " he said. "That's just too expensive for us."
But three-dimensional modeling is a giant step toward allowing cities and towns to have meaningful conversations about aesthetics. The whole point, Mr. Kwartler said, is to avoid the experience of someone saying, "Gee, I didn't know it would look like this!"

HEADLINE: Vanishing Oases

 BODY:

To the Editor:
In these booming economic times, it is truly a tragedy that the world-class city of New York still cannot ensure the protection and care of the wondrous modern spaces like those noted in "When It Goes It's Gone: Manhattan's Vanishing Oases" (Dec. 2). In addition to the respite for which they were intended, these plazas add immeasurable value, inspiring both up-and-coming and veteran designers in all fields, not just architecture and landscaping but crossing into textiles, home accessories and even fashion. 
 I have spent time since childhood in each one of these oases and others. Truly, these small jewels enriched my aesthetic sense and delighted me. My parents introduced me to them all, traveling from Brooklyn and the Bronx in the 1960's and 1970's to enjoy the unlimited, virtually free cultural offerings around the city. As an adult I continued to visit them, during lunch hours, waiting for a friend. They were never empty. These were defining experiences, contributing to my professional and personal interests today.
There was an excuse during New York's fiscal crisis. What is it now? It is a fact that with adequate care for parks and plazas, crime there disappears. One individual's newly acquired Internet wealth could sustain all the plazas in an endowment. Adoption of a plaza by a local corporation is still an attractive vehicle. An adequate budget for the Parks Department, combined with a private partnership, could solve the whole problem. These spaces are part of New York's and the country's unique architectural history.

HEADLINE: Irate Customers Say Stamford Needs Their Old Diner, Not Another Tower

BYLINE: By JACK CAVANAUGH 

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn., Dec. 15

 BODY:
Sculptured and streamlined by years of urban renewal, the downtown business district here is a futuristic landscape of corporate office towers and a windowless, fortresslike mall.
Then there's Curley's Diner, a bustling, aluminum-plated, neon-signed outpost of Stamford's past. 
 "It is one of the few constants left in Stamford," said Jim Stevenson, 63, who was finishing his breakfast in a booth at the diner, across West Park Place from several new, more upscale restaurants. "Yuppie-type restaurants come and go downtown, but Curley's remains the same, a place where you can get food at reasonable prices around the clock, and as Stamford's ultimate forum for discussion of most any topic by people from all walks of life."
But to others, including city officials, Curley's is an impediment to further development in this corporate mecca, whose population of about 100,000 doubles each workday. The Stamford Urban Redevelopment Commission has condemned the 58-year-old diner to clear the way for an 11-story building to house stores and 418 apartments, 80 percent of them high-rent units.
The commission, using its powers of eminent domain, has offered Maria Aposporos and her sister, Eleni Begetis, $233,000 for the building and its land, both of which they own, and which many people think is worth considerably more. Even the chairman of the commission, Stephen Osman, conceded in an interview that a Boston developer, Corcoran Jennison Companies, was paying the city $4.625 million for the 1,700-square-foot diner and its 5,736-square-foot land along with several other old buildings to the west and northwest.
But the diner's owners say that whatever the financial offer, they have decided to stay put. Today, they and 35 supporters marched a quarter-mile from the restaurant to the Stamford Government Center to protest the move. About 7,000 people have signed a petition to preserve the diner, which draws customers from surrounding communities as well as from nearby offices.
"Just what Stamford needs, another high-rise with expensive apartments," John Murphy, a retired building administrator for I.B.M., said as he finished a breakfast of bacon, eggs, hash browns, toast and several cups of coffee, all for $2.60, with no charge for the coffee refills. "To tear this place down to put up a high-rise is outrageous."
Acquisition of the diner is part of a 19-year-old plan by the redevelopment commission to acquire property in what it describes as a blighted area covering two blocks just west of the Old Town Hall, in the heart of the business district. The property will be sold to a developer who has nearly completed the first building in the three-building project. The commission has offered to lease the diner space in the new buildings, but the diner's owners say the rents would be too expensive.
For many customers, the fight for Curley's Diner is about more than just a quick, cheap meal. Some are concerned about the loss of old buildings in Stamford, a former factory town where longtime residents still talk about the sudden demolition of the pre-World War I National Guard Armory on Washington Boulevard, just before Christmas 15 years ago.
For the diner's supporters, Curley's is an even greater landmark, indispensable for its food and homey atmosphere. But they are equally moved by the plight of Mrs. Aposporos, a 52-year-old Greek immigrant, for whom they share a warm affection.
"People are very angry about this because they love Maria and her diner," said Dee Denton, the head of a marketing firm in nearby Darien and a customer for two decades, who began the petition drive. "She's a very spunky woman and she's not giving up without a fight."
Mrs. Aposporos has waged her fight with signs placed in the diner's front window. "U.R.C. offers $240,000 for my business. Very generous," reads one, while another describes Mayor Dannel P. Malloy as "the Grinch who stole Curley's Diner."
Mr. Malloy, who said he was unaware of the sign and had not been in Curley's since he was a child, did not seem overly sympathetic to Mrs. Aposporos's plight. He said she should have known about the threatened condemnation of the diner when she bought the property. "After all," he said, "this plan has been on the books for decades."
But Mrs. Aposporos's lawyer, John Wayne Fox, a state representative who, like the mayor, is a Democrat, said it wasn't until 1988, 12 years after Mrs. Aposporos bought the diner and its property, that the commission's plan was amended to include the diner site.
Mrs. Aposporos and her sister bought the diner in 1976 from its original owner, Herluf Svenningsen, known as Curley. A former waitress at another demolished downtown restaurant, the Coney Island Grill on Atlantic Street, Mrs. Aposporos waits on customers, works the cash register and plays a role that goes beyond the diner.
"Not only is Maria a wonderful and warm hostess who serves very good food at very reasonable prices, but she is both a fighter and a giver," said Bill Arnone, 53, an accountant who works nearby and comes in for lunch several times a week. "She brings meals to prisoners in the city lockup, to people in a nearby senior residence, and feeds customers who are down on their luck."
Mrs. Aposporos, who immigrated from Greece in 1962, and whose husband, an engineer, died nine years later, has been known to deliver meals to longtime customers while they are ill.
"A few years ago, after I had suffered a heart attack, Maria found out about it and, without so much as calling me, brought me a hot lunch, and I live in Shippan, two and a half miles away," said Carroll A. Great house, 82, the retired president of a venture capital company that had its offices in Stamford.
It is not unusual for Mrs. Aposporos -- who has two grown children, one of whom, a daughter, Eleni, is a waitress in the diner -- to work up to 15 hours a day at Curley's, where she spends all of Thanksgiving and Christmas greeting customers, many of whom live at the nearby Y.M.C.A.
"This is my life, and I love my customers," Mrs. Aposporos said as Louis Maldonado, a customer in his 30's who was moving to Miami the next day, went over to give her a farewell hug and a kiss. "Now they want to take my little diner -- a place where mayors, but not the present one, and judges and all kinds of people have been coming for years -- and sell it for millions of dollars to a rich developer who will make more millions. It is not fair."
Mrs. Aposporos's lawyer, Mr. Fox, says the city's offer for the diner and its property is inadequate, and has hired his own appraiser. While conceding that the city has the right to invoke its power of eminent domain, Mr. Fox says that the agency may be ignoring guidelines set by the Board of Representatives, Stamford's main governing body. "For one thing, the board specified in a resolution in 1988 that affordable housing was to be a primary component in any further development by the U.R.C.," he said. "And yet only 20 percent of the apartments in the high-rise scheduled to be built on the diner's site will be affordable. That comes out to about 83 apartments. That's not what the board had in mind."
Some have suggested that the city build around Curley's. But Mr. Osman, the chairman of the redevelopment commission, said that was not feasible.
"I sympathize with Mrs. Aposporos, but sometimes small properties have to give way to larger developments," he said. "And we think the appraiser has set a fair price."
But most of Curley's regulars seem to feel that the diner is priceless.
"This is a historic place and Maria deserves to keep it right here," said Philip M. French, a lawyer, while having lunch, as he does every workday, with his wife, Judy, who is the office manager of his law firm. "It means a lot to an awful lot of people, many of whom can't afford to eat anywhere else. And besides that, it's like no other place in town."

Using Market Forces To Model Election Races

BYLINE: By LISA GUERNSEY 

 BODY:
For years, professors at the University of Iowa have provided political junkies a financial outlet for their wild speculation. The Iowa Electronic Markets is an online system that enables people to bid on the presidential or congressional candidates they think are most likely to win. Anyone could jump in -- as long as he was willing to spend at least $5 and had a Telnet connection to the Internet.
Now the markets are available on the Web (www.biz.uiowa.edu/iem), and an increasing number of prognosticators are putting their money where their mouths are. 
 When Robert Forsythe, an economics professor, and several other Iowa professors started the project in 1988, fewer than 200 traders got involved. This year about 3,900 people have signed up. The total investment is more than $86,000. Anyone online can place bids, worth up to $500, on the outcomes of the Republican and Democratic presidential nominations, the makeup of the Senate and House of Representatives, and the outcome in the United States Senate race in New York between Hillary Clinton and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York.
If a selected candidate wins, the trader who bid on that candidate receives $1 for every share purchased. For example, if Hillary Clinton wins the New York race, those who bid for her at 30 cents a share (her going price on Wednesday) will make a 70 cent profit on each share.
In 1996, the going price for President Clinton was only one percentage point away from the percentage of people who actually voted for him, a prediction that many pollsters would envy. LISA GUERNSEY

In Asia, Nasdaq Inspires Rush for Technology Stocks

BYLINE: By WAYNE ARNOLD 

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, Dec. 15

 BODY:
It's beginning to look a lot like Nasdaq on Asia's stock markets.
Never mind that there are few dot-com companies to speak of. Fever over anything to do with the growth of the Internet has spread to this part of the world, fueling a boom in stocks of electronics and telecommunications companies. 
 The reason for the rush into high-technology Asian stocks appears to lie in Nasdaq's record-setting jumps this month. A technology-led rally in Singapore pushed the benchmark Straits Times index up 8 percent to record highs. Mirrored in Hong Kong and Seoul, the trend was repeated within a week in markets in Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok. Even some telecommunications stocks in Indonesia appear to be swept up in the enthusiasm.
"If you talk about anything other than tech, investors just aren't interested," said Chang Chiew Yee, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney.
The Nasdaq has also shown it can pull Asian stocks down. Reacting to the 2.36 percent retreat in the Nasdaq on Tuesday, the Straits Times index fell 1.68 percent today, the benchmark index in Hong Kong fell 2.81 percent, and the Seoul index fell 3.90 percent. For the year, however, they all show strong performances, comparable to the 63 percent advance in the Nasdaq.
Asia's markets have long responded reflexively to big moves on Wall Street, but it usually has been large changes in the Dow Jones industrial average that energized investors here on the other side of the Pacific: signs of economic health in the United States are a good omen for Asia's export-dependent economies.
That Asian markets are beginning to track the technology-heavy Nasdaq market rather than the Dow average illustrates not only the evolving character of American corporate might, but also a shift in attitudes about where this region's economic future lies.
The rally partly reflects the fact that computers, telecommunications equipment, mobile phones and the parts that go into them represent a large share of Asia's exports and the belief that demand for such products will continue to grow. The rally also embodies a belief that the region is transforming itself in the aftermath of its two-year financial crisis to more closely resemble America's so-called new economy, in which the Internet forms the basis of an electronic marketplace.
At the same time, the new fascination with Internet-related investments has been accompanied by the same nagging doubts many market experts have about the United States boom, particularly the consequences for an economy where capital accrues fastest to money-losing enterprises. More troubling to skeptics in Asia is that most of this region's economies, while improving, can hardly be called healthy. The largest corporations are still buried in debts, and many banks are feeble.
"People are still at the talking stage for all this new-economy stuff in Asia," said David Fernandez, an economist at J. P. Morgan.
The mess in Asia's banks means less money is available for corporate expansion. According to Merrill Lynch, only Singapore and Hong Kong have regained financial health. The banking systems in South Korea, Indonesia and Thailand are still insolvent. But the story for Asia's electronics exports is compelling. Most economists foresee continued economic growth in the United States next year, and they think that will fuel orders for Asian electronics, which are already near their highest level in 20 years, according to Merrill Lynch. That should benefit electronics manufacturers as well as help finance Asia's bank bailouts and its overall economic recovery.
More demand, economists predict, is likely to come from within Asia itself as consumer spending accelerates with economic recovery. Asia is one of the fastest-growing markets for cellular phones.
"It's a glorious situation out there," said Janardan Menon, an analyst at Kleinwort Benson Securities in Singapore. "There's a global shortage in semiconductors; hand-phone sales are still shooting through the roof; PC sales are strong. All put together there's no signs of any weakness."
And in contrast to times before the crisis, when Asian companies and banks lagged the United States in exploiting technology, most Asian governments have adopted policies to encourage companies and individuals to catch up with the West. Many are also trying to create their own versions of Silicon Valley, complete with a freewheeling entrepreneurial culture. The International Data Corporation predicts that electronic commerce in Asia will grow from 0.01 percent of the region's gross domestic product to 0.59 percent in the next five years.
Shares of Sapura Telecommunications Bhd., a Malaysian telephone equipment maker, have risen nearly 50 percent this month. Since October, Shinawatra Satellite of Thailand has climbed more than 60 percent, and the South Korean telephone company-cum-Internet service Dacom has more than doubled. Investors are even buying into the Malaysian telephone operator Telekom Malaysia, pushing its stock up nearly 16 percent this month. Chip-company stocks are also soaring.

HEADLINE: THE ISRAEL-SYRIA TALKS;
In the Three Main Players' Words: A Sense of Their Moment in History

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 15

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from statements on Mideast talks today by President Clinton, Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and Foreign Minister Farouk al-Shara of Syria, as transcribed by the Federal Document Clearing House, a transcription service:
 
PRESIDENT CLINTON
When the history of this century is written, some of its most illustrious chapters will be the stories of men and women who put old rivalries and conflicts behind them and looked ahead to peace and reconciliation for their children.
What we are witnessing today is not yet peace, and getting there will require bold thinking and hard choices. But today is a big step along that path. Prime Minister Barak and Foreign Minister Shara are about to begin the highest level meeting ever between their two countries. They are prepared to get down to business. For the first time in history, there is a chance of a comprehensive peace between Israel and Syria and indeed all its neighbors. . . .
We should be clear, of course. The success of the enterprise we embark upon today is not guaranteed. The road to peace is no easier and in many ways it is harder than the road to war. There will be challenges along the way. But we have never had such an extraordinary opportunity to reach a comprehensive settlement.
Prime Minister Barak, an exceptional hero in war, is now a determined soldier for peace. He knows a negotiated peace, one that serves the interests of all sides, is the only way to bring genuine security to the people of Israel, to see that they are bound by a circle of peace. President Assad, too, has known the cost of war. From my discussion with him in recent months, I am convinced he knows what a true peace could do to lift the lives of his people and give them a better future. . . .
 
PRIME MINISTER BARAK
We came here to put behind us the horrors of war and to step forward toward peace. We are fully aware of the opportunity of the building of responsibility and of the seriousness, determination and devotion that will be needed in order to begin this march together with our Syrian partners to make a different Middle East, where nations are living side by side in peaceful relationship and in mutual respect and good neighborliness.
We are determined to do whatever we can to put an end and to bring about the dreams of children and mothers all around the region to see a better future of the Middle East at the entrance to the new millennium.
 
MR. SHARA
Your announcement, Mr. President, was warmly welcomed both in Syria and in the Arab world and its positive echoes resonated in the world at large. That is because it promises for the first time the dawn of a real hope to achieve an honorable and just peace in the Middle East.
And as you have mentioned in your letter of Oct. 12, 1999, to President Assad, the issues have crystallized and difficulties defined. That is why, if these talks are to succeed as rapidly as we all desire, no one should ignore what has been achieved until now or what still needs to be achieved. It goes without saying that peace for Syria means the return of all its occupied land. While for Israel, peace will mean the end of the psychological fear which the Israelis have been living in as a result of the existence of occupation, which is undoubtedly the source of all adversities and wars.
Hence, ending occupation will be balanced for the first time by eliminating the barrier of fear and anxieties and exchanging it with a true and a mutual feeling of peace and security. Thus, the peace which the parties are going to reach will be established on justice and international legitimacy, and, thus, peace will be the only triumph after 50 years of struggle.
Those who reject to return the occupied territories to their original owners in the framework of international legitimacy send a message to the Arabs that the conflict between Israel and Arabs is a conflict of existence in which bloodshed can never stop, and not a conflict about borders, which can be ended as soon as parties get the rights, as President Assad has stressed to these meetings more than once before and after Middle East peace conference. We are approaching -- we are approaching the moment of truth, as you have said. And there is no doubt that everyone realizes that a peace agreement between Syria and Israel and between Lebanon and Israel would indeed mean for our region the end of a history of wars and conflicts and may well usher in a dialogue of civilization and an honorable competition in various domains -- the political, cultural, scientific and economy.
Peace will certainly pose new questions to all sides, especially for the Arab side, who will wonder, after reviewing the past 50 years, whether the Arab-Israeli conflict was the one which solely defied the Arab unity or the one which frustrated it. During the last half-century, in particular, the vision of the Arabs and their suffering were totally ignored, due to the lack of immediate opportunity for them to convey their points of view to international opinion.
And the last example of this is what we have witnessed during the last four days of attempts to muster international sympathy for a few thousand settlers in the Golan, ignoring totally more than half a million Syrian people who were uprooted from tens of villages on the Golan, where their forefathers lived for thousands of years and their villages were totally wiped out from existence.
The image formulated in the minds of Western people and which formulated in public opinion was that Syria was the aggressor and Syria was the one who shelled settlements from the Golan prior to the 1967 war. These claims carry no grain of truth in them.
As Moshe Dayan has explained in his memoirs, it was the other side who insisted on provoking the Syrians until they clashed together and then claimed that the Syrians are the aggressors.
Mr. President, the peace talks between Israel and Syria have been ongoing for the last eight years, off and on, of course. We hope that this is going to be the last resumption of negotiations, which will be concluded with a peace agreement, a peace based on justice and comprehensivity, an honorable peace for both sides that preserves rights, dignity and sovereignty. Because only honorable and just peace will be embraced by future generations. And it is the only peace that shall open new horizons for totally new relations between peoples of the region.
President Assad announced many years ago that peace is the strategic option of Syria, and we hope that peace has become the strategic option for others today in order to have or to leave future generations a region that is not torn with wars, a region whose sky is not polluted by the smell of the blood and destruction.
We all here agree that we are at a threshold of a historic opportunity, an opportunity for the Arabs and Israelis alike, and for the United States and the world at large. Therefore we all have to be objective and show a high sense of responsibility in order to achieve a just and comprehensive peace, a peace that has been so long awaited by all the peoples of our region and the world at large.

HEADLINE: Senate Legislation Proposes To Close Puerto Rico Base

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 15

 BODY:
The Senate will hold hearings next month on a bill to close the $3 billion naval station in Puerto Rico, a move that would clearly hurt the Puerto Rican economy, if the commonwealth refuses to allow live-fire exercises to resume on the island of Vieques.
The governor of Puerto Rico today called the legislation a "petty political move" that would cause major economic damage to the commonwealth, his spokesman said. But the bill's sponsor, Senator James M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma, said naval operations in Puerto Rico would not make sense without use of the Vieques range. 
 And in a sign of the Clinton administration's concern over the diminishing prospects for a settlement, John Podesta, the White House chief of staff, will meet a top official in the administration of Puerto Rico's governor, Pedro J. Rossello, on Thursday to prepare for a meeting next week between Governor Rossello and President Clinton, Puerto Rican officials said. The Clinton administration declined to answer questions about the base closing proposal or the upcoming meetings.
Senator John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia and chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said in an interview today that it made sense to close the Roosevelt Roads naval station on the main island of Puerto Rico if the commonwealth refused to allow training on the smaller island of Vieques.
"We're clearly of the view that if the range is lost, it is highly likely that we would close Roosevelt Roads," Senator Warner said.
That naval station serves the Navy battle groups and marines that train in Vieques and open waters around Puerto Rico. Roosevelt Roads provides $300 million to Puerto Rico's economy each year and employs 2,500 civilians and 2,400 military personnel.
Earlier this month, President Clinton ordered a halt to live-fire military training on Vieques to help resolve an eight-month dispute between the Navy and Puerto Rico. In April, a Puerto Rican civilian guard was killed in a bombing accident, leading to political protests that have united Puerto Rico as no other issue has.
Since then, the Navy and Marine Corps have been prevented for the first time since 1941 from using the range for exercises they consider essential training for combat readiness.
Governor Rossello rejected Mr. Clinton's compromise offer, which included restricting exercises on Vieques to non-explosive, or inert, ordnances, reducing by half the number of days that exercises would be held and ending all exercises within five years unless the local residents agreed to an extension. Mr. Clinton also offered Vieques a $40 million economic revival package to demonstrate that the Navy understood it must "repair relations" with the people of Vieques.
Angel Morey, Puerto Rico's secretary of state, will meet with Mr. Podesta on Thursday to arrange a meeting as early as next week among the governor, Mr. Clinton, and Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen, said Alfonso Aguilar, press secretary for the governor.
"Just the fact that the White House is receiving Mr. Morey, and eventually the governor, shows the president is making a great effort to look out for the welfare of the people of Vieques," Mr. Aguilar said. "This is a positive first step showing the president and the White House are still in the dialogue and willing to compromise."
But, senior administration and military officials said, a settlement has to be reached in the next several weeks to allow the Navy to plan for alternatives if the battle groups can no longer train on Vieques.
Even without the pending legislation in the Senate, the Navy would automatically examine closing Roosevelt Roads station if Vieques was lost, a senior Naval official said.
"The relationship between Roosevelt Roads and the mission of Vieques range is very close," the official said. "If we lose Vieques, it would be cause for a review of the value of keeping Roosevelt Roads."
This year the Pentagon failed to persuade Congress to approve a new round of base closings at installations around the country that have lost their use in the post-cold-war era but continue to cost billions of dollars to maintain. Now several senators are proposing to close Roosevelt Roads if there are no more exercises at Vieques.
"Put yourself in the position of a senator or representative who closed a military installation," Senator Inhofe said. "Politically, you can't resist closing down Roosevelt Roads. It's a no-brainer."
Governor Rossello was not surprised that the Senate is threatening to close Roosevelt Roads, Mr. Aguilar said, adding, "The governor has known for some time that this argument would be used against him."
Puerto Rican officials said that Roosevelt Roads was important even without Vieques and was used in the war against drugs as well as other military training.
Since this summer, the Navy has been searching for alternatives to Vieques for training exercises. But military officials say they have yet to find anything to duplicate the "unique qualities" of Vieques.
Earlier this month, the Navy and Marine Corps put together a "patchwork" of training for the aircraft carrier Eisenhower and its battle group, including a Marine detachment, which leaves for its next assignment to the Mediterranean in February without training at Vieques. Instead they used bases in Florida and North Carolina for pilots to drop bombs and marines to storm the beach, as well as temporary naval artillery training on Cape Wrath in Scotland.

HEADLINE: NATO Meets on European Plan for Strike Force

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Dec. 15

 BODY:
The United States and other non-European Union members of NATO sought assurances today that the European Union's decision to develop its own military arm will not eventually split the alliance.
At their year-end meeting, the NATO foreign ministers also condemned Russia for its military campaign in Chechnya. 
 And the European NATO members pressed the United States for more information on its plans for a missile defense system to guard against attacks by rogue states.
Much of the meeting, however, focused on the decision the 15 European Union countries made last week to give the body a military capability.
The Europeans want a military capability separate from NATO so they can respond to security crises that the United States wants to stay out of.
At their meeting last week, European Union leaders set a deadline of 2003 to develop a rapid-reaction corps of 50,000 to 60,000 troops.
The 19-nation NATO alliance generally approves of the plan, believing that anything that increases military power is good for NATO. The United States also accepts the idea. But there is concern in Washington that a European military arm could grow away from NATO, splitting the alliance.
Eight NATO members are not members of the European Union -- the United States, Canada, Turkey, Norway, Iceland, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. Most of the non-European Union members from Europe are concerned that they could be left out of decision-making on European security.
Washington has been pressing the European allies to increase their military capabilities. The allies have declared their willingness to do so, but that has yet to be translated into expanded military budgets.
"Intentions are all very good, and new institutions are very useful, but it's results that count," said NATO's secretary general, Lord Robertson.
Also today, European NATO members expressed concern about how they will be affected if the United States deploys the limited ballistic missile defense system it is now developing.
The United States has told its allies that with the new system, it would be just as ready to come to Europe's aid.

HEADLINE: Bucharest Journal;
A Glutton for Kitsch, Gorging Happily in Romania

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

DATELINE: BUCHAREST, Romania, Dec. 13

 BODY:
What kind of man specializes in buying up the tchotchkes of a Stalinist dictator who was prevented only by an untimely rendezvous with a firing squad from holding the world's tackiest yard sale?
Well, the kind of man whose name is Dr. Kassem Nour of Orlando, Fla. Or Dr. Ru Ru of Bucharest, depending on which one of his business cards he hands you. 
 "Oh, I have more than one name," he says reassuringly, fishing out a second card when the first does not match the introduction.
Dr. Nour, or whatever, an affable man whose face can explode into a carnival-poster smile at the approach of a camera, claims to own a "Renoir that's not in any book" and to have drunk cheap wine with Salvador Dali, whose work he says he collected.
When asked where he is from, he goes a little vague and spins diverting family yarns. (His grandfather from Russia, a better-late-than-never type, married at 60, fathered 10 children by 96, died age 106. Car crash. No, he wasn't driving.)
Dr. Nour is still childless at 72, but evinces an obvious appreciation for the fabled beauty of Romanian women even during pauses while looking at the -- we will do best to call it "stuff." As he and his translator play chess with one of many hand-carved sets on sale, he makes a move: "I love Romanian girls! I love you!"
"I don't believe you," she replies, with a skepticism that sounds even better in a Transylvanian accent.
This past weekend saw the fourth of the continuing auctions of stuff that once belonged to Nicolae and Elena Ceausescu, who ruled Romania from 1965 to 1989 with iron fists concealed in custom-made deerskin gloves. For a few of those years they were the darlings of the West for defying the Soviet Union over its invasion of Czechoslovakia, and they had the Buicks given them by President Nixon to prove it. (Not to mention a tie-tack key to Chattanooga, Tenn., inscribed "Pat Rose, Mayor.")
In their latter years, after a trip to North Korea, they became obsessed with building their cults of personality; they were barely literate but styled themselves the Great Builder and Hunter (he) and the Great Scientist (she) as well as the Beloved Comrades of the People. And they had all sorts of stuff to prove that: A yard-tall wooden amphora carved with their portraits, gift of a local party chapter. A microscope and a model of an atom from local schools, to aid Elena in her "research." A 9-inch model of an oil well's pressure valve. Rugs woven with their likenesses. (The editor of a political humor magazine bought one so his staff could tread on it.) Several sets of deer-butchering instruments with handles made of stag horn.
And a large set of cobalt blue china from Mikhail Gorbachev, of which Dr. Nour is the proud owner, for $320. He also wears Mr. Ceausescu's sealskin coat, his gray Italian woven leather shoes and his hats. "They fit perfectly -- his head is like my head," Dr. Nour said. "The only difference is mentality."
These first four auctions have raised almost $700,000 for the government.
Dr. Nour has bought about half the items. Asked about the source of his income, he says he gave up life as a surgeon -- "Where? Oh, I operate everywhere -- America, Middle East . . . " -- to make a fortune in marble and granite, and owns hotels in America and the Far East. He is a bit vague about his plans for his purchases: "I'm a collector. I love, I love, I enjoy. I'm planning to do a museum. They're more valuable if you keep them some time."
He seeks uniqueness first, but has an appraiser's eye: he knocked down his potential bid for the amphora (floor price $500) because it wasn't of one piece of wood. (It didn't sell.) He passed on a Belgian cut-crystal vase because nothing about it said "previously owned by tyrant." He bids higher if another household name is attached -- the mother-of-pearl table from Yasir Arafat, for example.
He ignored big items like the aging yacht Snagov 2, which seats 57 but has not been gassed up in a decade. And he was outbid for the 3,000-pound bronze bust of Nicolae. That went, for $26,000, to an American who would not disclose what he planned to do with it.
"Probably an American museum," said Monica Anghelovici, an economist for the state protocol administration who helps with the auctions because her English is fluent.
What American museum, for Pete's sake? she was asked.
"There are many wax museums in your country, so why should there not be bronze museums?" she said. "In America, in my opinion, anything is possible."
Since the Ceausescus had 41 residences to furnish, from ski dachas to palaces, nothing was too mundane for them to save. One item was described thus in the catalog: "Round bowls of black plastic, painted, with the inscription Niagara Falls." They sold for $17. Average Romanians refer to the collection in terms that would once have sent them to labor camps. But it was Miss Anghelovici who delivered the most damning assessment: "In my opinion, a man receives a gift as he is. I give something special to someone who is special. And I give something stupid to someone I don't care."
Why, she was asked, in this era of $30 million paintings wasn't this sale entrusted to Sotheby's or Christie's, which are used to moving hundreds of items quickly and could probably round up more bidders than will trek to Bucharest? After all, Dr. Nour may be one of a kind, but the collecting mania draws all types.
(In the interests of full disclosure, it must be noted here that this reporter unexpectedly discovered that he is one of those types, and is now the dubiously proud owner of an engraved ceremonial ax and the aforementioned oil-well thingy.)
"I don't know," Miss Anghelovici replied. "We didn't think of it. The government decides, and we just do what we are told."

HEADLINE: Where the Risk Is Riskier Yet;
A New Breed of Venture Capitalist Scouts Latin America

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, Dec. 15

 BODY:
Upon arriving in the big Amazon port of Belem several months ago, Patricia Moles, the manager of a venture-capital fund, was faced with an unusual investment-related decision: whether to continue by boat to the hearts-of-palm plantation in which her fund was hoping to acquire a minority stake, a trip that would take 12 hours, or to rent a propeller plane.
"Time was a must so I chose the plane," said Ms. Moles, 33, a native of Mexico, whose Brazil-based employer, Banco Axial, looks for investments in environmentally friendly companies. Although her trip was off the beaten track of the briefcase bankers who stick to financial centers like Sao Paulo, it was indicative of a new investment trend that is sweeping Latin America. 
 Venture capitalists are searching the region for opportunities in young companies, much as they have been doing in Silicon Valley.
Many of these financiers like the challenge of nontraditional investments -- organically produced hearts of palm, for example, grown from custom-selected and -germinated seeds that generate a continuing supply of palm stems.
Yet most venture capitalists investing in companies with a Latin American focus, like those providing seed money to ventures in the United States, are seeking out high technology -- particularly Internet-related companies.
The quest is complicated by the often precarious nature of Latin American economies as well as the relative lack of advanced technology, along with the generally frenetic nature of the young Internet industry.
The growth of venture-capital investing is part of the wider trend of private equity investors focusing on Latin America, a huge market. Though the region has quickly embraced the Internet, it still has a long way to go in terms of wealth and technology to catch up with the richest industrial nations.
Unlike earlier waves of investment, most of which came from abroad or were state-sponsored, the venture-capital investments of the last few years have pitted some of Latin America's richest people against foreigners, particularly from the United States.
Among the Latin Americans are Juan Navarro, president of the Exxel Group, one of Argentina's largest privately owned companies; Jorge Paulo Lemann, founder of Garantia, a big Brazilian investment bank now owned by the Credit Suisse Group, and Carlos Slim Helu, chairman of Telefonos de Mexico. Then there are the people who work for, or are partners in the venture-capital funds controlled by these investors.
Antonio Bonchristiano is an example of this new breed. Six months ago, Mr. Bonchristiano, 32, was a partner in a fund that is part of GP Investimentos, an investment group based here, whose owners include Mr. Lemann. His task was to seek out an appealing Brazilian Internet company and buy it.
What he came up with was BookNet, an online bookseller similar to Amazon.com, and GP acquired a controlling stake. In something of an unusual twist, Mr. Bonchristiano became the company's chief executive, switching roles from venture capitalist to entrepreneur. Using his knowledge of the game, he then went to New York to drum up additional money, and returned with $14.3 million from firms like Warburg Pincus and individual investors like Henry R. Kravis of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company.
BookNet was renamed Submarino, and now the company's headquarters here is brimming with 50 employees working 14-hour days and relieving stress at a couple of pinball and foosball machines. The company has opened offices in Spain, Argentina and Mexico, and aims to become the leading online shopping destination in the Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking world.
"This is dreamlike for me as a Brazilian," Mr. Bonchristiano said in English polished during his undergraduate years at Oxford. "Brazil was colonized for so long, either economically, intellectually or technologically, and the Internet is changing that. With new access to investment and technology, the playing field is leveled."
Latin America's capitalist structures are still considered relatively backward, though. Domestic stock markets are riddled with labyrinthine regulations that make it hard to buy or sell securities. And some investors, including Dennis Rodrigues, a partner in the Sao Paulo-based firm FIR Capital, see the evolution of domestic capital markets as the key to the success of venture-capital investing in Latin America.
But other investors, as well as many entrepreneurs, are drawn by the possibility of leapfrogging local exchanges and listing their companies on markets in the United States, nearly always Nasdaq, hoping for some of the paper wealth made possible by a market fascinated with dot-coms.
Going public on Nasdaq is a lot easier with help from people who have generous sources of capital and who also know the American regulatory environment. That is where venture capitalists from the United States come in. Among the most active of these is Chase Capital Partners, part of the Chase Manhattan Corporation.
Together with Flatiron Partners of New York, Chase Capital Partners has invested in five Internet companies that focus on Latin America. The largest, StarMedia Network, a New York-based portal company for Spanish and Portuguese speakers worldwide that also provides Internet access in some Latin American countries, has been its biggest success so far. After StarMedia went public earlier this year, the initial investment by Chase and Flatiron of $29 million grew to well over $300 million.
While some venture operations, like GP Investimentos, often seek to acquire control of companies, others, including Chase, have invested in Latin America in a way that is closer to the traditional Silicon Valley model of providing seed capital to small companies that then proceed through several rounds of financing before going public. Usually, this model involves the purchase of a minority stake in the company, through which management direction is provided but not dictated.
"Being a venture capitalist in Latin America largely involves adapting what has worked in the United States to what is realistic in countries like Mexico and Brazil," said Susan Segal, head of Latin American operations for Chase Capital Partners.
E-commerce, for instance, is as strong a lure in the region as it is in the United States, and has accounted for some of Chase's bets -- like its recent investment in Mercado Livre, an Internet company hoping to reproduce online some of the fervor of a boisterous open-air market. The Boston Consulting Group estimates that revenue from electronic commerce in Latin America will grow to $3.8 billion in 2003 from $167 million this year.
Yet while most signs point to the growth of purchases over the Internet, and of Latin American Internet use in general, obstacles to such rosy outcomes remain. According to a report by the International Data Corporation, weak credit card processing operations, the high cost of basic Internet service and precarious and costly shipping networks will inhibit the spread of e-commerce.
And the use of computers and even telephones in the region is still relatively low, a limiting factor for all Internet businesses. For instance, in Brazil, Latin America's largest country, there are an estimated 12 telephone lines for each 100 people, compared with more than 50 lines for every 100 people in the United States.
And the entrepreneurial culture that speeds the creation of start-ups in the United States is different in Latin America. "Some entrepreneurs that are used to sealing deals with a handshake don't realize that a lot of rigorous detail is needed to put together a venture-capital deal," said Lisa Krochmal, a lawyer in the Buenos Aires office of Morrison & Foerster, an American firm active in new technology deals.
Another concern is the erratic nature of the Internet industry itself. As in the United States, most young Internet companies in Latin America lose money. This, coupled with the boom-and-bust cycles of Latin American economies, makes some investors wary of betting on the region's young companies.
"A lot of people are going to get burned when they realize that transforming an interesting idea in Brazil into a stock appealing to retail investors in the U.S. is no piece of cake," Mr. Rodrigues of FIR Capital said.
Still, where some people see obstacles, others see opportunities -- opportunities that require capital to realize.
Aiming to bring Internet access to people without a phone or a computer, an American, Terrence Danial, helped found NetKiosk, a Buenos Aires-based company that sells stand-alone units equipped with a PC that allows users to surf the Net for a fee. In addition to sales of the units, which are put in places like hotel lobbies, NetKiosk hopes to gain revenue from selling advertising that appears on the units as well as on the company's portal page. But NetKiosk has had trouble attracting seed money.
"In my view, venture capital in Latin America still has a long way to go," said Mr. Danial, adding that the seed-money industry is not as well developed in the region as it is in the United States and that potential backers are often warier of taking risks. "A lot of investors are still seeing things from traditional business mind-sets," he said.

HEADLINE: THE ISRAEL-SYRIA TALKS: THE OVERVIEW;
SYRIA AND ISRAEL BEGIN PEACE TALKS AFTER 4-YEAR HALT

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SONTAG 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 15

 BODY:
Israel and Syria today resumed peace negotiations that stalled nearly four years ago, with the modest goal of surviving two days of breaking the ice in a relationship long frozen by mutual mistrust. That goal appeared likely to be met.
As the day kicked off in a small ceremony in the Rose Garden, it carried the makings of a historic moment, with Israel and Syria standing resolutely on the brink of a new dialogue that could spell the end of a decades-long conflict. The mood quickly soured when the Syrians publicly reiterated well-worn grievances against the Israelis, signaling just how rocky the road ahead may be, but later, behind closed doors, the mood apparently sweetened once more. 
 Today did begin the highest-level Israeli-Syrian talks to date, what President Clinton called "a big step along the path" to peace. First at the White House, then at Blair House, Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel met with Foreign Minister Farouk al-Shara of Syria under the auspices of Mr. Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright.
The face-to-face encounter sent a clear signal of intentions as both sides approached the negotiating table with a determination to see things through to an eventual accord. A firm desire to make peace was voiced by both sides, and Mr. Clinton urged them to seize the moment and present him by Thursday with an itinerary for their peacemaking, a senior administration official said.
By late tonight, an Israeli official reported, Mr. Barak was in good spirits, indicating that the atmosphere at the negotiations had been positive and productive, and that both sides seemed willing to go forward.
Early this morning it was almost startling to see the Israeli and Syrian officials file out and take their places side by side in the wet grass behind the White House this morning. One senior Israeli official chatted amiably with one of the Syrians, as if small talk between the two sides were an everyday occurrence.
Then Mr. Barak, Mr. Shara and Mr. Clinton marched out in their somber suits and did a little shuffle. Mr. Barak and Mr. Shara apparently reversed their assigned positions alongside Mr. Clinton, until Mr. Barak said, with a fleeting smile, "I think we have to change," and they did.
From there on, it was downhill, an inauspicious start. Mr. Clinton and Mr. Barak did as planned, giving short, idealistic speeches about the desire for peace and the difficulty of securing it. Mr. Shara, on the other hand, launched into a substantial summary of Syria's grievances.
He cleared his throat, and took advantage of a rare platform. Making excuses for speaking at relative length on such a cold day, Mr. Shara argued that the Israeli occupation was the root of all misery, not just Syrian misery but Israeli misery as well.
"It goes without saying that peace for Syria means the return of all its occupied land," he said, "while for Israel, peace will mean the end of the psychological fear that the Israelis have been living in as a result of the existence of occupation, which is undoubtedly the source of all adversities and wars."
As Mr. Shara spoke those words, Mr. Barak clasped his hands, pursed his lips and stared forward without expression. American officials shifted uneasily from foot to foot. A senior Israeli official later said the Israelis were upset by Mr. Shara's nonconciliatory tone, which quickly and jarringly broke the mood.
Mr. Clinton had talked broadly and hopefully, pronouncing this a juncture unlike any other in the long Israeli-Arab peacemaking effort. "For the first time in history, there is a chance of a comprehensive peace between Israel and Syria, and, indeed, all its neighbors," he said.
He praised the resolve of both Mr. Barak, whom he called "an exceptional hero in war" who is now "a determined soldier for peace," and President Hafez el-Assad of Syria, who also "has known the cost of war." Without such adornments, he referred to Mr. Shara as "an able representative" of his people.
Then, very succinctly, Mr. Barak reiterated his broad intentions in pursuing peace, making a point to refer to the Syrians as "our partners."
"We came here to put behind us the horrors of war and to step forward toward peace," he said in a three-sentence statement.
Mr. Shara, though, refused to be stage-managed. He spoke with apparent awareness of his audience at home and throughout the Arab world. He gave the impression that he could not let himself be manipulated by the Israeli and the Americans into performing on cue, not as he was entering negotiations in which Syria would take the exceptional step of accepting the permanence of the Jewish homeland.
He proclaimed that now as ever before, all Syria wanted was to reclaim "all its occupied land," that is, the Golan Heights, the strategic plateau that Israel seized during the 1967 war. He criticized the media at large for portraying Syria as "the aggressor," the one "who shelled settlements from the Golan prior to the 1967 war.
"These claims carry no grain of truth," he said, taking the inflammatory step of citing the memoirs of Moshe Dayan, the legendary Israeli general, as proof: "As Moshe Dayan himself explained in his memoirs, it was the other side who insisted on provoking the Syrians until they clashed together and then they claimed that the Syrians are the aggressors."
Mr. Shara also made it clear that the Syrians still wanted to pick up negotiations where they felt they had been broken off in 1996. The Syrians maintain that Yitzhak Rabin, the late Israeli prime minister, had promised that Israel would withdraw from the full Golan Heights, down to the border of June 4, 1967.
That, in the Syrians' interpretation, extended to the shoreline of the Sea of Galilee. The Israelis deny that this promise was ever made, and dispute the interpretation of the border.
"If these talks are to succeed as rapidly as we all desire, no one should ignore what has been achieved until now," he said.
At the same time, Mr. Shara did embrace the idealism of peace, which he said could not only end violence in the region but also "usher in a dialogue of civilization and honorable competition in various domains -- the political, cultural, scientific and economic."
And he also posed an intellectual question, as if he were already reflecting backward from the vantage point of a resolved conflict: Would the Israeli-Arab conflict be what "defined" or "frustrated" Arab unity?
In Israeli-Arab peace negotiations, there is often a good deal of public posturing aimed at the audiences back home. Sometimes, belligerent words mask real progress at the table.
Mr. Barak and Mr. Shara met for a total of just under two hours, but never, as had been expected, without the Americans present. They started in a trilateral meeting with Mr. Clinton in the Oval Office, picking up again in a three-way meeting with Ms. Albright. The Israelis and the Syrians agreed to let the White House speak publicly about the very sensitive talks so as not to harm whatever progress was made with public comments.
Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman, said that in the meeting with Mr. Clinton, both sides "raised their positions and concerns while acknowledging that the other side's concerns needed to be addressed."
"Both parties displayed a serious intent," he said.

HEADLINE: Fund to Help Save Open Space in New Jersey

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
Seeking to stem the loss of undeveloped land to suburban growth in the Northeast, the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation will give $14 million to projects protecting fields, marshes and forests in New Jersey and Rhode Island, the most densely populated states in the country, foundation officials said yesterday.
Most of the money, $8.4 million, will be used over the next four years to help private conservation groups buy at least 10,000 acres of land or restrictive easements in parts of central and northern New Jersey where construction threatens two important ecosystems: the Pine Barrens and the ridge of highlands that is the state's western backbone, foundation officials said. 
 They said $950,000 would be given over the same period to two private groups in New Jersey working to strengthen local land trusts and promote land-use planning by local governments that focuses not just on economic growth but also on protecting wetlands and other fragile habitats.
A similar package of grants, totaling $4.7 million, is being made to private groups in Rhode Island, said Peter Howell, the director of environmental programs for the foundation.
The $1.5 billion foundation, based in Manhattan, was established in 1997 by the estate of Ms. Duke to protect the environment and support the arts and medical research.
The $8.4 million for land protection in New Jersey will be split over the next four years between the Nature Conservancy and the Trust for Public Land, two national conservation groups. The grants are contingent on the groups' raising at least $4 in public and private money for each dollar from the Duke foundation, Mr. Howell said.
Yesterday, representatives of the two groups said they were confident that the prospect of the Duke foundation money would make it easier to raise the rest.
Rose Harvey, the senior vice president of the Trust for Public Land, said the extra money would come from other private donors, from New Jersey's recent bond act for protecting open space and from local taxes intended to preserve green tracts in crowded communities.
"This commitment of private funds is a great example and will leverage many more dollars," Ms. Harvey said.
She added that the need to protect land was greater than ever. Housing construction, she said, is threatening the northern Pine Barrens -- a patchwork of stream-laced woods full of rare species -- and spreading up the ridge of rugged hills, west of the state's coastal plain, that forms a green bridge linking many parks and sheltering many species.
The announcement by the Duke foundation was welcomed by environmental groups around the metropolitan region, mainly because it would provide a spur to land preservation in a state that has not seen many large gifts from philanthropists intended for environmental protection, particularly compared with New York.
Just a few dozen miles to the east, in the Hudson River Valley, for example, more than $125 million has been spent over the last decade on preserving land by a single foundation, the Lila Acheson and DeWitt Wallace Fund for the Hudson Highlands.
"It's great to see this commitment to New Jersey," said Joe Martens, the president of the Open Space Institute, one of two groups that are conduits for the Wallace fund money, which can be spent only in New York State.
He said the Duke foundation appeared to be establishing a long-term commitment to the region, with the new grants following its gift of $5 million in 1997 to secure the purchase of Sterling Forest, a 16,000-acre wooded tract straddling the New York-New Jersey border.
"The amount of money necessary to curb sprawl and encourage good land use is in short supply," Mr. Martens said, "particularly in places where development is heaviest and land prices are the highest."

HEADLINE: ON HOCKEY;
A Lack of Charisma Hurts Devils at Gate

BYLINE: By Joe Lapointe 

 BODY:
Rainwater dripped through a hole in the roof at Continental Arena when the Devils played the Los Angeles Kings on Tuesday night. This is the first known leak in the 13-year administration of General Manager Lou Lamoriello.
It created a few puddles in the higher elevations, but no fans got wet. Only 10,807 of them were sprinkled around a building that seats 19,040. For a game between two of the best teams in the National Hockey League, it was the smallest Devils home crowd of the season. 
 This type of scene is becoming commonplace in too many National Hockey League rinks. You expect crowds such as the 6,526 the Islanders drew Tuesday night for Edmonton, because the Long Island franchise is held hostage by miserly owners who run it like Baltic Avenue on the Monopoly board. But the Devils are a better operation.
Their general manager may be tight-fisted and their coach may be tight-lipped, but the players perform in a more freewheeling style than they did in the Jacques Lemaire era. When the Devils swamped the Kings by 7-1 Tuesday night, the building was so empty in the third period that you could hear Coach Robbie Ftorek yelling at the referee. At least he opens up to somebody.
According to the N.H.L., attendance is down, leaguewide, an average of only 32 fans a game, from 16,097 to 16,065. But it has dropped in the Meadowlands from 16,382 to 14,236. Blocks of tickets are available in fancy new arenas in Montreal and Anaheim, which used to sell out in recent seasons. New buildings in Los Angeles and Carolina are rarely filled. All this in an era of economic prosperity. What would happen in a recession?
"I was worried when I was driving to the game with Marty," said Bobby Holik, referring to the Devils' goalie, Martin Brodeur. "I was saying 'We'll be lucky if we break double digits in thousands.' I guess we barely did. All the players can do is play the way we did tonight. That's our part. The rest is up to people in charge of marketing this sport."
Holik spoke in a postgame locker space that was quieter than most losing rooms. No music or chatter could be heard, the way it usually is when hockey teams win. Most Devils stayed apart from the news media in a private lounge. When requested, they came one by one to scrums with reporters.
Some Devils, such as Holik and Ken Daneyko, are verbose and opinionated. Most are polite. But some offer little more than name, rank, uniform number and platitudes. Unlike most Rangers, many Devils are homegrown, raised in franchise ways since their draft days. They know the corporate personality, which is taciturn.
The worst is Ftorek, in his second season as head coach after a long apprenticeship. Ftorek wounds the pride of raw rookies and respected veterans with surprise benchings, sometimes without communication, just so they don't get too big for their britches. Around the news media, you get the feeling Ftorek would be happy if the press box were as empty as the grandstands.
After a romp like Tuesday night's, his postgame briefing was tense, terse and chilly. He revealed that "the game is 60 minutes long." When someone offered him a chance to praise the play of Brodeur at a pivotal point of the game, Ftorek began with a pained sigh and responded, "That's a hypothetical," and added little more.
"Anything else?" Ftorek wanted to know after a couple minutes. Yes, there were a few other questions.
"Apart from the win, what do you take out of this game as the best thing?" someone asked. "I just like the 2 points," Ftorek said.
With all the depth of the roster, someone asked about tough decisions on who to sit out. "Sometimes they are, sometimes they are not," he said, elaborating only slightly with a few empty phrases.
Another voice urged Ftorek to discuss the improvement in the penalty killing. "I don't know," Ftorek said. "You'd have to look at the statistics."
They were trying to get him to praise and promote his team and he acted as if they were auditors questioning his tax return. Ftorek's dialogue with the news media is more contentious than Mike and the Mad Dog on sportstalk radio. (Speaking of WFAN: On most days you can listen for hours and the only reference to hockey, aside from the scores, is from Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, in a paid commercial, urging fans to go to Devils games.)
Last spring, in his first postseason with the Devils, Ftorek's tension was palpable and part of the reason his team left the playoffs after one round. Now, in December, with a half-empty building, after an impressive victory, he acted as if promoting his sport was a time-consuming irritation, such as getting a vehicle inspection in the Garden State.
Ftorek is a hockey lifer, smart and dedicated, but lacking a certain stage presence. Perhaps this coach and his bosses should heed the message from the sound of 8,233 empty seats.

HEADLINE: Silk Stocking's Mystery Hole;
Owner's Demands Keep Prime Manhattan Site Empty

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
For seven years, the dingy, vacant department store loomed over one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in the city like a dark cloud.
In recent months, the huge hulk at Lexington and 59th Street that was once an Alexander's has become a giant hole in the ground. But speculation about the block continues by everyone from the local community board to City Hall because no one knows exactly what is going in the hole and when. 
 Steven Roth, the onetime strip-mall king who controls the property, has wanted to build a magnificent 70-story tower on the site for much of the 1990's. But since 1993, he has gone through four architects and an equal number of possible tenants, including Sotheby's, Christie's, Nordstrom and Ritz-Carlton.
Mr. Roth, who is the largest commercial landlord in Manhattan, has been negotiating with yet another possible tenant, Bloomberg, the financial information services company, for nearly a year. But many people who know him say that Mr. Roth, one of the shrewdest real estate investors in the country, may miss out on the current economic boom because of uncharacteristic indecision.
"Steve is a great friend, but for some reason, he hasn't wanted to push the development forward," said Donald J. Trump, the developer who once wrestled with Mr. Roth for control of the Alexander's chain. "Only Steve knows why. But at some point, the cycle will change and he'll have a nice piece of vacant land."
Mr. Roth, a compact, silver-haired man who relishes a blunt-spoken, tough-guy image, is chairman of Vornado Realty Trust, a publicly traded company valued by Wall Street at $2.7 billion. The company owns 23 buildings and more than 14 million square feet of office space in Manhattan, including One Penn Plaza.
Mr. Roth is also chairman of Alexander's Inc., which owns the two-acre property bounded by Lexington and Third Avenues, 58th and 59th Streets. Most people in the Silk Stocking neighborhood considered the empty six-story building a blight, yet developers and city officials said the parcel, across the street from Bloomingdale's, is one of the most valuable in Manhattan.
"It's a prime location, suitable for just about anything," said Edward Rubin, a member of Community Board 6.
According to those who know him, Mr. Roth has taken a keen personal interest in the property, his first construction project in Manhattan. He is also said to be a fierce competitor and does not like to lose a single round, whether it is at the negotiating table or on the golf course. According to one friend, Mr. Roth was only half kidding when he offered his golf instructor a small shopping center if he could help Mr. Roth reduce his handicap.
Mr. Roth is known as a smart investor and a savvy financier rather than a bricks-and-mortar developer, and real estate executives say he may be afraid of making a mistake. At the same time, he does not want anything less than the richest, most lucrative deal with a tenant. As a result, he has failed to sign one up for the constantly evolving project, leading one executive who knows Mr. Roth well to describe him as "the Hamlet of Lexington Avenue."
"He's smart enough to know that he's entered a realm in which he's not the master," said one prominent real estate broker who has worked closely with Mr. Ross. "There are so many ways to do this project wrong. And no developer starts out by developing a square block in Manhattan."
The broker said Mr. Roth had been unwilling to cede any control to a partner, or to cut a deal with prime tenants. "This is also a guy who can't commit because he is so afraid of leaving a penny on the table," the broker said.
David Mandelbaum, a wealthy New Jersey lawyer who helped Mr. Roth get started in business in 1968 and is now a director of Alexander's, dismissed the criticism, saying that the property has more than doubled in value over the years. In any event, he said, the project is moving forward now.
"It's happening," Mr. Mandelbaum said. "The hole's getting deeper. Steve's a real estate genius; there's no two ways about it. He was better off waiting."
And Wall Street does not mind that Mr. Roth is taking his time.
"He's a brilliant guy, the largest commercial landlord in Manhattan," said Jonathan Litt, a stock analyst with PaineWebber. "He will experience phenomenal growth as rents roll up. You almost don't care about Alexander's."
But for those who do, Mr. Roth is still mum about what he is planning for the site. He declined to be interviewed and few of his friends or critics were willing to discuss him or the project for the record, either because they do business together or want to do business with him. Mr. Roth has also not discussed his plans with city officials or the community board.
Contractors demolished the old six-story department store building earlier this year and halted work. Then, Joseph Rose, chairman of the city's planning department, announced plans to overhaul the zoning code and impose restrictions on building heights. (Those plans were unveiled last week.)
Mr. Roth quickly obtained an excavation permit and moved to build a foundation for a tower while the site is still subject to the old zoning code. Mr. Roth wants an 800-foot tower, according to executives involved with the project. If he had waited until next summer when the zoning proposal is expected to be adopted, the building would have been cut to 495 feet. "There's no doubt in my mind he will have a foundation in the ground before that law passes," Mr. Litt said. "He's too smart to lose that scale."
The 1.2-million-square-foot project would mix about 200,000 square feet of stores with office space, a hotel and luxury condominiums, according to real estate executives who have talked to Mr. Roth. But the plans are not final, said one person involved in the project, "because the building changes shape depending on which piece is largest."
Cesar Pelli, the architect who designed the world's tallest buildings, the Petronas Towers in Malaysia, has drawn plans for a 64-story tower, as well as a taller skyscraper, according to brokers who have talked to Mr. Roth and several people involved in the project. Mr. Pelli succeeded Sir Norman Foster, Gary Handel of Millennium Partners and the architects at Beyer Blinder Belle, all of whom worked on sketches at one time or another.
Mr. Roth has had substantive discussions with the owners of the Savoy hotel group of London, according to an executive with the hoteliers. And Hennes & Mauritz, the Swedish clothing retailer, has agreed to open a 40,000-square-foot store if the tower is built. But that may not be enough to get such a large building -- one slightly smaller than the General Electric Building at Rockefeller Center -- off the ground. Some brokers also question whether condominium prices will still be soaring three years from now, when the new tower would open.
Mr. Roth has also been meeting with Bloomberg for a year about leasing 400,000 square feet in the tower. But Bloomberg is frustrated with Mr. Roth's rent demands, according to real estate executives, and recently began exploring another option: expanding its current headquarters at Park Avenue, and in the adjacent building at 110 East 59th Street. Talks with Mr. Roth, however, continued last week.
"You can't get every last ounce of blood," said one executive who has negotiated recently with Mr. Roth, echoing a half-dozen others. "It's very hard to live that way."
Mr. Roth first gained control of the ailing Alexander's chain in 1991. He took the company into bankruptcy court, closed the stores and turned it into a real estate operation, much as he did with the Two Guys discount chain a decade earlier.
Mr. Roth met with the Milsteins, the Roses, the Resnicks and other major real estate families in New York in the hopes of finding a partner who had the expertise to develop the Alexander's site. But after hearing his complex financial plan, the families turned him down.
Mr. Roth then spent nearly two years with Sotheby's on a plan to move the auction house into a new home in the existing department store building, while he built an apartment tower overhead. But when Mr. Roth's ideas for the project changed, he dumped Sotheby's, and by December 1995 he was close to signing a deal with the auction house's biggest rival, Christie's. He also talked about buying Millennium Partners to act as his developer.
But neither happened. A frustrated Christie's decided to move to Rockefeller Center.
After losing a bid to buy the Coliseum property at Columbus Circle last year, Mr. Roth nearly formed a joint venture with Millennium Partners, which had a deal with the Ritz-Carlton hotel chain and Reebok sports club for the site. Once again, Mr. Roth pulled out at the last minute, wanting to do the project on his own. Vornado, however, did recently hire a headhunter to find a director of development for the company, said executives contacted by the firm.
In the meantime, Mr. Roth spent more than $2 billion buying office buildings in Manhattan and transforming Vornado, which had been focused on far less glamorous suburban shopping centers.
More recently, the Nordstrom department store chain, which has long sought a home in Manhattan, tried to strike a deal with Mr. Roth. The retailers expected Mr. Roth to compromise on the rent in exchange for landing an upscale anchor tenant.
During the negotiations, said one person involved in the talks, "Steve liked to begin by saying, 'Your worst nightmare just walked into the room.' He loves to play Mr. Tough Guy. But they were very far apart on the numbers." Nordstrom is now talking to the developer Douglas Durst about his proposed tower at 42nd Street and the Avenue of the Americas.
Mr. Rubin, the community board member who has been watching from the sidelines, asked whether Mr. Roth wasn't his own worst enemy here: "He's a smart guy, but isn't he going to miss the market if he doesn't get his act together?"

HEADLINE: Manufacturers' Output Grew by 0.3% in November, Fed Says

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 15

 BODY:
The nation's industrial output edged up 0.3 percent in November, indicating that the economy is heading into the new year on solid footing, government figures showed today.
Gains were widespread except for utilities, where output fell, the Federal Reserve Board said. Unusually warm weather last month depressed demand for electricity and natural gas. 
 Industrial production was 4.3 percent higher than in November 1998.
"That is indicative of a solid manufacturing base, which is what the economy is looking for as it approaches the end of the year and heads into a new millennium," said Richard Yamarone, an economist at the Argus Research Corporation.
Because of concerns about the Year 2000 computer changeover, many economists have said they expect the Fed to leave interest rates unchanged when policy makers meet next week.
Having raised interest rates three times this year to slow the economy and keep inflation under control, the Fed will, however, probably raise rates again in February or March because the economy is still growing at a pace that could set off inflation down the road, economists said.
The advance in industrial output, which was in line with many economists' forecasts, followed a surge of 0.8 percent in October.
Output at factories rose by a strong 0.5 percent in November. "Manufacturing's growth continues unabated and looks strong as we think about next year," said Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers.
Operating capacity held steady at 81 percent, the same as in October, well below levels associated with a pickup in inflation, economists said.
Generally, an operating capacity of 84 percent would alarm economists, indicating that factories just cannot produce fast enough -- which could lead to price increases.
The Commerce Department said yesterday that stockpiles of goods rose 0.2 percent in October, to $1.26 trillion, an increase that was smaller than expected and represents the slowest growth since April. The increase in September was 0.4 percent.
Inventories rose 0.3 percent at wholesalers and at factories but were flat at retailers.
Some economists said the inventory numbers suggested that companies were having trouble keeping up with strong sales.

HEADLINE: Wall Street's Embrace of Diversity Lauded Despite Its Poor Record

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN 

 BODY:
Despite their poor track record on hiring and promoting women and minorities, firms on Wall Street deserve credit for having started to embrace diversity, a study from the United States Commission on Civil Rights stated.
"The numbers show a dismal lack of progress," said Mary Frances Berry, chairwoman of the commission. "It is still true that white males dominate the most remunerative jobs and opportunities on Wall Street. But I cannot infer, legally, that anybody has been discriminated against." 
 Rather than dwell on those statistics, the commission applauded the efforts of some firms -- Citigroup, Goldman Sachs Group and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Company -- to recruit more women and minorities and to consider them for promotion to high-paying jobs, Ms. Berry said, summarizing the conclusions of the commission's study of economic opportunities in New York.
The report on Wall Street grew out of hearings the commission held four years ago, Ms. Berry said. The commission gathered employment data from the firms after those hearings, and again a few years later, she said.
"However slowly, change is occurring," she said. "By and large, the message is that things are a lot better than they used to be but not as good as they should be."
The firms accepted the report with a degree of relief in the wake of several lawsuits that have contended that Wall Street firms have systematically discriminated against women. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is reviewing hiring and pay data from Morgan Stanley, after a bond saleswoman at the firm claimed that she was denied a promotion because of her sex.
A spokesman for the Securities Industry Association, a Wall Street trade group, declined to comment yesterday.
But, in a prepared statement sent to firms, the group's president, Marc Lackritz, said, "As the report notes, we have already made significant progress in these areas."

HEADLINE: THE TRANSIT SHOWDOWN: THE OVERVIEW;
Transit Pact Raises Pay by 18% And May Influence Other Talks

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
The tentative contract that the transit workers union reached early yesterday would effectively increase pay by more than 18 percent over three years, giving subway and bus workers the largest annual raises received by any of New York City's public-employee unions in more than a decade.
The agreement enabled Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to declare victory over transit workers who favored a strike. But the contract's sizable pay increases could create problems for the city in next year's bargaining with unions representing 300,000 municipal workers, although the mayor insisted that the transit contract would have no influence on the talks. 
 The deal reached with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority just minutes after a threatened midnight strike deadline averted a much-feared walkout and allowed the city to return to normal yesterday, except for a few disruptions during the morning rush hour. A strike would have left the 3.5 million riders who use the transit system every day scrambling to find other means of transportation.
With the agreement giving transit workers a 7 percent compensation increase on average in the first year, union leaders immediately said it would at a minimum influence the city's contract negotiations and might serve as a model.
After accounting for inflation, several union officials said it was easily the most generous contract involving city workers since the early 1980's, except for a tentative contract reached yesterday for the city's school principals. That one-of-a-kind deal awards a 33 percent pay increase in exchange for the principals' giving up tenure and working longer hours.
Several labor experts said the transit workers' contract could signal a pendulum swing, bringing substantial raises for public-employee unions in an era of budget surpluses and economic boom. This would follow eight years of lean times and deficits when these unions accepted concessions, pay freezes and modest raises.
Officials of Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union said they would begin mailing ratification ballots to members this week, with the outcome announced in the second half of January. But several leaders of a militant dissident faction said they would campaign hard for rejection because, in their view, the contract was not generous enough and contained concessions on work rules.
The agreement, reached at 1 a.m. yesterday after five days of negotiations, includes an increase in base wages of 5 percent in the first year, 3 percent in the second and 4 percent in the third, for a total increase of about 12.5 percent. It would raise the average salary for a transit worker over the three years to nearly $44,000 from the current $39,000.
The deal also provides for a further increase in paychecks -- amounting to more than 6 percent over three years -- by allowing workers to greatly reduce their pension contributions.
Several labor experts said the overall package would increase New York City Transit's labor costs by slightly more than 20 percent if the M.T.A.'s increased contributions for health coverage were included with the cost of the wage and pension changes.
"They came out with a much better contract than anybody thought they'd get," said Denis M. Hughes, president of the New York State A.F.L.-C.I.O. "Whenever there is a contract agreement that is this prominent, the amount they get, the 4 or 5 percent, becomes the minimum of what other unions want to accept. It sets the tone."
At a morning news conference, Mr. Giuliani praised the union leaders for deciding not to strike, but he took pains to argue that the contract agreement would have no influence on the city's labor negotiations.
"It's not our settlement," Mr. Giuliani said. "The Transit Authority is a state agency, not a city agency."
Anticipating that other unions would look to the transit workers' contract as a model, he warned municipal labor leaders that he would not accept a similar contract.
"The overall percentages would be much too high for the city and it would cause significant deficits that would add to a deficit the city already has in out years," he said. "Whatever pattern is set is one for the state to have to deal with. It has nothing to do with us."
Tom Kelly, an M.T.A. spokesman, said the authority's top negotiators, after being up most of the night, were not available for interviews yesterday. M.T.A. officials said on Tuesday that they could afford the wage increases included in the accord, adding that they had achieved their chief goal of getting the union to agree to more flexible work rules that would help hold down costs.
For example, union rules that limit certain bus mechanics to engine work will be loosened so that they can also do chassis or brake repairs.
The union's executive board approved the deal in a close partisan vote, despite the pact's sizable wage increases, shortly before dawn yesterday, after the union's exhausted negotiators explained the details to the board. The vote was 25 to 20 for the agreement, with 1 abstention.
The union's militant New Directions faction, which had pushed for a strike, holds 22 of the board's 46 seats and voted almost unanimously against the agreement, calling it a sellout by the union's leadership. One of its board members voted for the contract and one abstained.
"There's a good chance that this contract will be defeated," said Tim Schermerhorn, a New Directions leader, who narrowly lost a race for the union's presidency last year. "People will be unhappy with the raises. The givebacks will kill it."
At his news conference, Mr. Giuliani continued to take a hard line against New Directions, calling its leaders irresponsible agitators and threatening to have the group's members arrested if they continued calling for a strike.
About 300 New Directions members marched across the Brooklyn Bridge yesterday afternoon, urging rejection of the contract and the impeachment of Mr. Giuliani, who obtained a court injunction that threatened union members with millions of dollars in fines if they went on strike. The New Directions marchers refrained from calling for a strike.
Arthur Schwartz, a New Directions lawyer, asked Justice Michael L. Pesce of State Supreme Court in Brooklyn to vacate his Tuesday injunction, arguing that it violated union members' First Amendment rights by barring them from speaking in favor of a strike.
Justice Pesce affirmed his order. Later, Mr. Schwartz appealed to Justice Guy J. Mangano of New York State Second Appellate Division to stay the order, but he refused.
Mr. Giuliani said a suspicious package that looked like a bomb was placed in a tunnel near New York City Transit's Brooklyn headquarters and caused delays of more than an hour on the A line shortly after 8 a.m.
The mayor denounced any labor-related disruptions and said he would seek heavy fines against any union member who violated the court order against disrupting service.
Albert O'Leary, a transit authority spokesman, said efforts to help a sick passenger, and not labor problems, caused major delays yesterday morning near Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn on the 2, 3, 4 and 5 trains.
"It was a normal day in the New York City subways," he said.
In the labor agreement, the M.T.A. pledged to back state legislation to reduce the transit workers' pension burden. Workers now paying 5.3 percent of their wages toward their pensions would have to pay only 2 percent, while another tier of workers paying 3 percent of wages in pension contributions would also pay 2 percent.
For many workers, this would mean that in the first year, their paychecks would increase by 8.3 percent -- a 5 percent raise and a 3.3 percent reduction in pension contributions.
Nonetheless, some workers voiced disappointment that the increase in base wages did not average more than 4 percent a year. Zulma Figueroa, a subway station agent in the Bronx, said: "I was rooting for 5-5-5, but this is not bad. I'm happy today. I'm happy we didn't go on strike."
Municipal labor leaders said they were impressed by the contract negotiated by Willie James, president of the transit workers union.
"It's a pretty healthy settlement," said Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers. "It's interesting that the mayor distanced himself from it and said it has no impact. Obviously, every settlement in and around the metropolitan area is going to have an impact on our negotiations, and to say otherwise is ludicrous."
Lee Saunders, the director of District Council 37, the largest union of municipal workers, agreed that the pact would affect next year's bargaining with the Giuliani administration. "None of us are operating in a vacuum," he said. "It's going to have some kind of impact."
But Deputy Mayor Randy L. Levine, the mayor's chief labor negotiator, insisted that the transit accord would prove irrelevant to next year's talks. "This will have no impact on the city's labor negotiations," he said in an interview. "The M.T.A. negotiations never had any impact on the city. As the mayor said, this deal is too rich for the city."
Diana Fortuna, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a business-backed watchdog group, questioned whether New York City Transit could afford the agreement.
"It puts pressure on the fare," she said. "There's no two ways around that. If all the public gets out of this agreement is a more expensive transit system, then it's a terrible deal. But if the M.T.A. got work-rule changes that make the system run more efficiently, that would change the equation."
Many commuters rejoiced yesterday that there was an agreement rather than a strike. Robert Jones, a Microsoft-New York general manager who lives in Fairfield, Conn., said, "I mostly use cabs to get around the city, and if there had been a strike it would have been nearly impossible to get one today, so it's a big relief."
Gov. George E. Pataki, who controls the M.T.A.'s board, called on union members to approve the contract.
"A strike would have caused significant chaos in the city and would have been illegal," he said. "I urge all of the members to keep this in mind as they consider this contract."

GRAPHIC: Photo: Some transit workers demonstrated in City Hall Park yesterday to show their dissatisfaction with a proposed new contract. (Chang W. Lee/The New York Times)
 
Chart: "OVERVIEW: The Subways Kept Rolling"
Crucial terms of the transit workers' contract.
 
LENGTH -- Three years, expiring Dec. 15, 2002
JOB SECURITY -- No layoffs of unionized employees for the duration of the contract.
WAGES
 Increase of 5 percent on Dec. 15, 1999.
 Increase of 9 percent on Dec. 15, 2000.
 Increase of 4 percent on Dec. 15, 2001.
 
PENSIONS -- The M.T.A. agrees to support state legislation that will reduce transit workers' contributions to their pension plan as follows: those paying contributions equal to 5.3 percent of their wages will pay 2 percent and those making a 3 percent contribution will pay 2 percent -- all without reducing their pensions.
HEALTH CARE -- The M.T.A. agrees to increase its contribution to health coverage by 6 percent a year as well as add an additional $3.75 million a year -- a move that union officials say will mean that workers will not have to increase their out-of-pocket expenses for premiums or co-payments. Union officials say the health plan will begin providing unlimited chiropractic coverage to the union as well as to begin providing some orthodontic coverage.
DISCIPLINARY PROCEDURES -- The M.T.A. agrees to ease some of its strict disciplinary rules. With the M.T.A.'s progressive disciplinary system in which workers face greater punishment for each new infraction, the M.T.A. agrees to give less weight to past infractions for those workers who go a year or more without any violations.
WORK RULES -- The M.T.A. says it will cut costs by obtaining more flexibility in assigning responsibilities to its workers. For example, mechanics who repair bus engines will now also be allowed to repair bus chassis.

Investment Bankers Offered a Tax Break

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
Connecticut has offered tax concessions to Warburg Dillon Read if it agrees to expand its headquarters and bring more jobs to the state.
Warburg Dillon Read, the investment banking arm of the Swiss banking giant UBS, could increase its work force from 3,0000 to 5,000 people by consolidating its United States operations in Stamford. 
 The proposal for up to $50 million in tax credits, which was made to the company on Tuesday by the State Department of Economic Development, is subject to approval by the General Assembly.
The company moved its North American headquarters from New York City to Stamford in 1997, after the legislature approved $145 million in tax incentives.
Ted Meyer, a company spokesman, declined comment beyond a prepared statement that said the company was growing rapidly and was always evaluating options to accommodate its needs.

Fleet Bank to Expand

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
Fleet Financial Group says it plans to add up to 400 new jobs in two cities, Utica and Rome, N.Y.
Fleet did not say how much the jobs would pay. However, since unemployment in the area is only 3.6 percent, the company could have trouble filling the positions, said Karl Felsen, a Fleet spokesman. 
 The low unemployment rate could be good for people looking for jobs because it might lead to competition among service industry companies, said Arthur Friedberg, an economics professor at Mohawk Valley Community College.

HEADLINE: Retailers and Governors Attack Proposal to Make the Internet a Tax-Free Zone

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 15

 BODY:
Proposals to make the Internet a tax-free zone came under withering attack today by major retailers, shopping-center owners and state and local officials in testimony before a commission created by Congress to study the question.
Wal-Mart Stores, Federated Department Stores, the International Council of Shopping Centers and other members of a hastily formed alliance calling itself the E-Fairness Coalition said it would be wrong for government to discriminate against bricks-and-mortar retailers and in favor of those operating online. 
 "Proposals to make the Internet a sales-tax-free zone are attractive," the coalition told the panel, the Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce, "but have potentially devastating economic, tax and social consequences."
Gov. William J. Janklow of South Dakota, speaking on behalf of state and local governments whose largest source of revenue is sales taxes, said, "America can't survive if we have discriminatory taxes."
"We cannot adopt a tax policy that assists in wiping out small-town merchants," he said.
Witnesses spoke at the commission's third set of hearings this year amid growing indications that the 18-member commission is divided into three firmly entrenched camps. A consensus appears unlikely to develop before an April deadline for the group to recommend a national policy on taxing electronic commerce.
One faction, led by Gov. James S. Gilmore III of Virginia, the commission chairman, favors a blanket tax exemption for Internet commerce. Declaring that the Internet's growth "must not be thwarted by taxation," he would have the federal government increase grants to the states to make up for revenue losses.
Gov. Michael O. Leavitt of Utah and other commission members favor a plan by the National Association of Governors and by local governments to create a national clearinghouse, financed by the states, to process sales taxes and turn them over to the 6,527 state and local agencies that impose sales taxes.
A third faction, led by Dean Andal, chairman of the California Board of Equalization, a state tax agency, favors maintaining the system in which online sales are subject to sales tax only when the merchant has a physical presence, like a retail store or warehouse, in a state where it ships goods.
The commission heard from several panels of witnesses who said that complying with different tax rates from place to place, and different rules on which items are taxable, would be a costly administrative nightmare.
Mayor Ron Kirk of Dallas, a commission member, ridiculed those arguments. "These companies can reduce every color in the universe to digits and put the complete details of building a car into a computer but they can't handle sales taxes?" he asked, mockingly. "Totally incongruent."
Another member, Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, criticized state governments for going on a spending spree and said taxes from online sales would just allow more profligacy. Mr. Norquist said making the Internet a tax-free zone would force state and local governments to lower sales tax rates, which often total 8 to 9 percent in industrial states, to a range of 3 to 5 percent.
But Governor Janklow said the states had cut spending by $25 billion in this decade, mostly by lowering income and property tax rates. He said making the Internet a tax-free zone would diminish the power of the states and increase the power of the federal government.
Governor Janklow's testimony drew a rebuke from Citizens Against Government Waste, a Washington group calling itself the nation's largest tax watchdog. "South Dakota governor proposes Gestapo tactics to collect the state sales tax," the group said in a press release, calling e-commerce "the vanguard of America's current economic growth."

CORRECTION-DATE: December 21, 1999, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Thursday about retailers who told a tax study commission that they oppose making the Internet a tax-free zone included one company erroneously among the group, known as the e-Fairness Coalition. Federated Department Stores is not a member and does not agree with the coalition's views.

HEADLINE: MOVIE GUIDE

 BODY:

Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film or series. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. An index of reviews of films opening today appears on Page 10.
 
Now Playing
 
* "ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER," starring Cecilia Roth, Marisa Paredes, Antonia San Juan and Penelope Cruz. Directed by Pedro Almodovar (R, 101 minutes). A whole new order of Almodovar extravaganza. The antic fizz and theatrical exaggeration of this filmmaker's earlier work have blossomed into a newly sophisticated style, one that is far more wise and deeply felt. Lovingly dedicated to actresses who have played actresses, this film weaves its own soap opera around "A Streetcar Named Desire" and tells of splendidly resilient women; Mr. Almodovar has aptly described his material as "screwball drama." Rich and entertaining, this story celebrates the power of artifice and impersonation to transcend ordinary truth. The irrepressible Ms. San Juan, a Spanish nightclub performer, plays a transsexual named Agrado and is the film's biggest treat (Janet Maslin). 

* "BOYS DON'T CRY," starring Hilary Swank and Chloe Sevigny. Directed by Kimberly Peirce (R, 114 minutes). This stunning debut feature tells the strange and resonant story of Brandon Teena, who despite being born Teena Brandon went on to create a charismatic identity as a young man. Brandon's ultimately wrenching tale may sound tabloid-ready, but on screen it turns into Theodore Dreiser's idea of American tragedy. The film makes it hauntingly real and even tenderly romantic, with the astonishing acting needed to make it work. One of the year's best (Maslin).
 
* "THE CIDER HOUSE RULES," starring Tobey Maguire, Charlize Theron and Delroy Lindo. Directed by Lasse Halstrom (PG-13, 125 minutes). Radically downsized in scope, and its examination of the issue of abortion greatly softened, John Irving's sixth novel (with a Dickensian screenplay by the author) has been turned into a lovely World War II-era fable about a young man venturing out into the world. Mr. Maguire is Homer Wells, a doleful innocent raised in an orphanage by Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine), who performs abortions. Fleeing the institution with a golden young couple (Ms. Theron and Paul Rudd), he becomes an apple picker. Sentimental but smart, the movie has the sweetness and narrative drive of a 40's "David Copperfield" (Stephen Holden).
 
"CRADLE WILL ROCK," starring Emily Watson, John Turturro, Ruben Blades, John Cusack, Joan Cusack, Bill Murray and Vanessa Redgrave. Written and directed by Tim Robbins (R, 132 minutes). This huge Depression-era story features well-known figures from Orson Welles to Nelson Rockefeller to Diego Rivera, and it works them into an ambitious "Ragtime"-like tableau. Though too many figures in this landscape are reduced to naive caricature, Mr. Robbins and his impressive cast bring strong passions to bear upon this (mostly) true story of a legendary event: the trouble-fraught production by Welles and John Houseman of the banner-waving 1936 agitprop musical "The Cradle Will Rock." Mr. Robbins and his cast play out all sides of this event with the certitude that its importance lives on (Maslin).
 
* "THE END OF THE AFFAIR," starring Ralph Fiennes, Julianne Moore, Stephen Rea and Ian Hart. Directed by Neil Jordan (R, 105 minutes). Mr. Jordan's intoxicating version of Graham Greene's 1951 novel, in which an illicit affair becomes a far greater gamble than either lover could have imagined. For this fearlessly eclectic filmmaker, this is one more intelligent, brooding love story with a secret twist. Mr. Fiennes and Ms. Moore breathe life into this story with a dreamy, erotic intensity that in no way trivializes the film's underlying ideas about religious faith. Period detail (the setting is London in the mid-1940's) is sumptuously heightened by the inspired costume designer Sandy Powell ("Shakespeare in Love") (Maslin).
 
"END OF DAYS," starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Robin Tunney, Gabriel Byrne and Kevin Pollak. Directed by Peter Hyams (R, 118 minutes). The star modestly tackles the role of a new savior who may just keep mankind free of Satan for the next thousand years. And that's not even the worst thing about this pointlessly nasty would-be thriller. The material is so derivative that it amounts to a tag sale of used parts from better apocalyptic films, with special credit owed to "The Exorcist" for grisly sacrilegious tricks. Mr. Hyams favors a jack-in-the-box approach to delivering shock value. The star dutifully protects a nice young woman from demonic forces. But Mr. Byrne plays the swaggering embodiment of pure evil and has the better role (Maslin).
 
"THE GREEN MILE," starring Tom Hanks, Michael Clarke Duncan, David Morse, Doug Hutchison, Sam Rockwell and Bonnie Hunt. Written and directed by Frank Darabont (R, 180 minutes). In adapting the death row drama that Stephen King wrote in multiple installments, the director of "The Shawshank Redemption" could have managed more economy and fewer talky bits of business around the cellblock. Still, this lengthy film is vivid and well played. Smooth ensemble acting builds up to the discovery that a gigantic condemned man (Mr. Duncan) is a prisoner with very special abilities, which gives the film its mixture of religious overtones and mild horror. Mr. Hanks, as a wry Southern prison guard, is so unaffectedly good that it's redundant to say so (Maslin).
 
* "LIBERTY HEIGHTS," starring Adrien Brody, Joe Mantegna and Ben Foster. Directed and written by Barry Levinson (R, 134 minutes). This semi-autobiographical comedy-drama remembering teenage life, anti-Semitism and racism in mid-1950's Baltimore is the fourth movie by Mr. Levinson to be set in his native city. A deeply felt nostalgia trip, the movie adroitly captures the look and social attitudes of the city 45 years ago. But the screenplay and performances are too muted for the movie to come to terms with growing pains cushioned in the nostalgic haze (Holden).
 
* "MANSFIELD PARK," starring Frances O'Connor and Jonny Lee Miller. Written and directed by Patricia Rozema (PG-13, 105 minutes). In Ms. Rozema's skillful screen adaptation of Jane Austen's third novel, the protagonist Fanny Price (Ms. O'Connor) has been sharpened into a proto-feminist heroine who triumphs over the materialist, patriarchal values of her wealthy relatives through a combination of wit, beauty and daring. Without bearing down too heavily, the screenplay (which incorporates fragments of Austen's letters and diaries) equates early 19th-century slave trading with the oppression of women. The message is leavened with smart humor and warm three-dimensional performances (Holden).
 
"MISS JULIE," starring Saffron Burrows and Peter Mullan. Directed by Mike Figgis (R, 100 minutes). As directed by Mr. Figgis, whose previous films "Internal Affairs" and "The Loss of Sexual Innocence" dwelled obsessively on the darker aspects of sex, August Strindberg's late-19th-century drama becomes a bleak study of the sexual disgust shared by a rebellious aristocrat (Ms. Burrows) and the upwardly mobile footman (Mr. Mullan) she taunts into having sex. But the movie's contemporary cinema-verite style is at odds with the story and its setting. And Ms. Burrows's coldly haughty title character is far less compelling than Mr. Mullan's earthy, cunning footman (Holden).
 
"SLEEPY HOLLOW," starring Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon, Jeffrey Jones, Michael Gough and Christopher Walken. Written by Andrew Kevin Walker and directed by Tim Burton (R, 110 minutes). This ornate visual fantasy, artfully concocted using a palette that suggests nuclear winter, has little to do with Washington Irving's story and everything to do with Mr. Burton's macabre vision. Mr. Depp makes a dashing hero as the film's shy detective, but the story (by the writer of "Seven" and "Fight Club") is determined to put the ick into Ichabod Crane. A first-rate cast and extraordinary technical talents are attention-getting here, but so is the film's penchant for sardonic beheadings. It's possible to admire Mr. Burton immensely for the secret tenderness and rich imagination of his work without wanting to peer at the exposed brain stems of his characters (Maslin).
 
"SWEET AND LOWDOWN," starring Sean Penn, Samantha Morton and Uma Thurman. Directed by Woody Allen (PG-13, 95 minutes). In homage to the kind of jaunty 1930's jazz that has been heard on many of his other films' soundtracks, Mr. Allen imagines a consummate jazz character: Emmet Ray (played with gusto by Mr. Penn), who can play the guitar as gorgeously as Django Reinhardt but lacks certain interpersonal skills when it comes to his private life. Borrowing attributes of various real musicians, the film turns Emmet into another one of Mr. Allen's cad-geniuses and gives him a long-suffering mute laundress as a sweetheart. (Ms. Morton works miracles in her wordless role.) But on the storytelling level, the film remains flimsy. It's the musical interludes, frequent and lovingly presented, that keep it alive (Maslin).
 
* "TOY STORY 2," with the voices of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen. Directed by John Lasseter; a Pixar Animated Studios film (G, 98 minutes). A wonderfully playful sequel, sustaining the first film's wit and novelty while bringing new sophistication to computer-generated animation. And here is welcome proof that Hollywood can still make movies to please audiences of any age or persuasion. From its opening (a perfectly adorable "Star Wars" parody) to its Capraesque conclusion, this is seamless work with more metaphorical cleverness than that usually found in the toy bin. Colorful new characters and more adventurous action enhance the story of how Woody falls into the clutches of a sleazy toy dealer, experiences newfound celebrity and needs to be rescued by his old friends (Maslin).
 
* "TUMBLEWEEDS," starring Janet McTeer and Kimberly J. Brown. Directed by Gavin O'Connor (PG-13, 100 minutes). An astoundingly vital performance by the British actress Janet McTeer makes this small, beautifully acted slice of contemporary Americana a must-see film. Ms. McTeer is Mary Jo Walker, a sexy, free-spirited woman with four marriages behind her who travels across the country with her 12-year-old daughter, Ava (Ms. Brown). Like few other films, this one captures an intimately loving (though not conflict-free) relationship between a parent and child without becoming saccharine. The director plays Mary Jo's trucker boyfriend, who is only the latest in a series of romantic disasters (Holden).
 
* "THE WAR ZONE," starring Freddie Cunliffe, Ray Winstone, Tilda Swinton and Lara Belmont. Directed by Tim Roth (not rated, 99 minutes). Mr. Roth is an actor known for roles in tough films, but never for anything quite as raw as this. In this searing first feature, the title battlefield is a rural English home where a teenage boy looks upon his own family with helpless rage and astonishment. Sensing the incestuous relationship between his father and older sister, the film's wordless, baleful young hero struggles to come to terms with this household horror. Understated but extremely graphic at times, and shot with mournfully expressive simplicity by Seamus McGarvey (Maslin).
 
"THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH," starring Pierce Brosnan, Sophie Marceau, Dame Judi Dench, Robert Carlyle and Denise Richards. Directed by Michael Apted (PG-13, 128 minutes). This director is much admired for his "Up" series chronicling the lives of former schoolchildren as they mature. And he has managed to make James Bond grow up a little, too. Mr. Brosnan has grown much more comfortable with the role of Bond, and most of the other characters are also more interesting than might have been expected. Ms. Marceau slinks memorably through the role of a treacherous oil heiress. Ms. Richards seemed a lot smarter playing high school vixens than she does as a brilliant scientist here. The itinerary roams from Scotland to Central Asia. And Mr. Apted handles the action as well as he does the talk (Maslin).
 
Film Series
 
BOGART RETROSPECTIVE. He was a gangster. He was a private eye. He skippered a fishing boat and ran a cafe in Casablanca. He was, of course, Humphrey Bogart (1899-1957), the son of a Manhattan surgeon and a magazine illustrator who achieved stardom in Hollywood. Now, on the occasion of the centennial of his birth, he is the subject of a retrospective in BAMcinematek, the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Rose Cinemas' repertory program at 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, in Fort Greene. This weekend offers two of his best: tomorrow, Raoul Walsh's "They Drive by Night," about two truckers framed for murder; and on Sunday, John Huston's "Maltese Falcon," with Bogart as the private detective Sam Spade, drawn into the intrigue surrounding a murder and a priceless statuette. Each film is to be shown at 3, 6 and 9 p.m. Screening times are subject to change. Admission to "Bogie at BAM," through Jan. 30, is $8.50 for adults and $5 for people over 62, children under 12 and students with valid identification. Information: (718) 623-2770 (Lawrence Van Gelder).

HEADLINE: Fixing a Building, Building a Career

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA ROWE 

DATELINE: KINGSTON, N.Y.

 BODY:
For decades this city's grand old City Hall a national historic landmark -- sat boarded up and abandoned, decaying from the inside. Passersby would shake their heads at the brick edifice splattered with pigeon dung, and students at Kingston High School across the street would avert their eyes.
Among those most bothered was T. R. Gallo, who lived two blocks away and had grown up smarting at the inescapable symbolism of a city building left to rot. 
 "Every Kingstonian who passed it had to wonder where the city was heading," Mr. Gallo said. "Is that our future, a boarded-up derelict building in the heart of our city?"'
He kept his feelings to himself for a while, at least until he could become mayor of this city beside the Hudson River. It didn't take long: In 1993, at the age of 33, the Democrat was elected, presumably as Kingston's last mayor. A referendum passed that year decreed that whoever was elected would serve a two-year term and then hand over the reins to a city manager.
But Mr. Gallo would not be so easily removed. He turned his mayoralty into a 24-hour-a-day post, knowing that the sight of a mayor riding snowplows at 5 a.m. and blacktopping the streets alongside city workers would make an impression. It was the first hint of Mr. Gallo's staunch belief in the power of perception, and in the way perception can become reality.
Indeed, Kingston's residents changed their minds about wanting a city manager and resoundingly re-elected Mr. Gallo in 1995 with 85 percent of the vote. Last month, they elected him again: Mr. Gallo had become the only mayor in Kingston's 127-year history to run unopposed.
"T. R. Gallo is the consummate politician," said Jim Thompson, chairman of Kingston's Republican Party, who even considered cross-endorsing the mayor in last month's election. "He's young, he's aggressive and he gives the voters what they want."
What the mayor, still baby-faced at 39, has given them is a lesson in showmanship powerful enough to win millions of dollars from the federal government for high-profile projects like the reconstruction of the old City Hall. Yet his critics say it is exactly that focus on image that leaves less glamorous concerns -- like full-throttle economic development -- to fall by the wayside. City-sponsored historic-house tours and Christmas parties are nice, they say, but not enough.
"Tourism just doesn't cut it," said Robert Senor, a Republican member of the Common Council and a frequent critic of the mayor.
While many economically sluggish Hudson Valley cities are racing to build strip malls and entice superstores, Kingston, under Mr. Gallo's leadership, is trying to turn back the clock, to make its history a source of economic strength.
This was the first capital of New York, the burial place of the state's first governor, George Clinton, and the site of the courthouse where Sojourner Truth sued and won her son's freedom from slavery. The Gallo administration has sponsored re-enactments of the city's 1777 burning by the British, rehabilitated elegant old buildings and built a trolley to shuttle visitors between two historic districts. (The intersection of John and Crown Streets is the only place in America where 18th-century stone houses stand at all four corners.)
Mr. Gallo's restoration of old City Hall is the apex of that effort. Even in the dusty plaster of reconstruction, it has a sense of Titanic-like, ghostly grandeur.
Built in the 1870's in High Victorian Gothic style and refurbished after a fire in 1927, it has staircases of salmon-colored marble. The entranceway that leads a visitor's eye up to the 25-foot ceilings is ornate wrought steel.
Back in his current, somewhat drab City Hall office, T. R. Gallo -- the initials stand for Thomas Robert -- mused about the inauguration he plans to hold there for himself next month. (The current City Hall, built long and low in typical 1970's prefab style, will become a police station and city court.)
"To start the millennium in that historic room, I think, would just be awesome," said Mr. Gallo, who plans to move city offices there in the spring. The construction site is the first place he takes visitors, and he finds an excuse to stop by himself nearly every day. Every detail, down to doorknobs, fascinates him. "This is my favorite part of being mayor," he said. "It's possibly the greatest thing I've ever accomplished in my life."
Most of that life has been spent in public buildings. Mr. Gallo, the son of a city alderman, has been a government employee since the age of 21, when he dropped out of the State University of New York at New Paltz several credits shy of graduation because the Democratic Party offered him a job as the city's civil service director.
His lack of experience outside the public sector is not lost on Mr. Gallo's critics. They say the mayor is out of touch with the struggles of business owners and has become bull-headed with his success.
"I find most politicians have never owned their own business and they've never had to deal with their own money," said Karen Vetere, who runs a real estate agency and says taxes in Kingston have become untenable for many local merchants. (Even the city's most inviting areas are pocked with empty storefronts.)
"I suppose for every good city to move along there has to be a strong person at the helm, and when T. R. came along he was young, he was full of energy," Ms. Vetere said. "But unfortunately, what motivates a lot of politicians is their ego, and now our mayor's ego is larger than the whole city of Kingston."
It is that self-assurance, Ms. Vetere conceded, that gave Mr. Gallo the gumption to tackle a project as ambitious as restoring City Hall to its Victorian glory. And even his most vocal detractors are impressed by the mayor's grant-getting success. In six years, he has won $25 million in state and federal funds for small businesses, historic renovation and the arts, which, like everything else, Mr. Gallo appraises as a strategist.
The mayor "may not have a sophisticated view of what the arts are," said Ron Marquette, executive artistic director of the Ulster Performing Arts Center, who has been the recipient of many mayoral grants. "But he recognizes the bottom line. He recognizes that the arts mean business." Last month, Mr. Marquette named Mayor Gallo the Arts Advocate of the Year.
No aesthete, Mr. Gallo is, however, an unabashed showman. Last year, when B. B. King was scheduled to perform at the arts center and the blues legend refused to get off his tour bus, Mr. Gallo marched on to demand why. It seemed Mr. King's treasured guitar, "Lucille," was en route to Kingston on another bus and had not yet arrived. Mr. Gallo dispatched city police officers to find Lucille, whose driver was wandering lost through the city, and set up a police escort to zoom the guitar to the theater.
"Well, the police come tearing up Broadway with this bus that had nothing on it but a guitar and the crowd roars and then B.B. runs on stage, holding the guitar above his head and says, 'I want to thank the mayor of Kingston for saving my Lucille,' " recalled Mr. Marquette, fairly choking with laughter. "It made the news in Paris."
But not all of Mr. Gallo's efforts have met with such success. While he persuaded the Common Council to build a $3 million industrial park for Huck Industries, Kingston's largest private employer, the rest of the complex sits vacant three years later. Meanwhile, taxes are going up, the city has borrowed money to pay its end-of-year bills, and Mr. Gallo is asking for a $15,000 pay raise. (In six years, he has increased his annual salary to $50,000 from $37,500.)
"On the surface, yes, he's a good mayor, giving parties to the seniors and putting out planters with flowers," said Mr. Senor, the Republican council member. "But he's using City Hall, which is a good project in many ways, as a tool to make himself look good while there are some serious problems that aren't being addressed."
Mr. Gallo is so busy with city minutiae that he relies on his secretary to keep track of everything from political obligations to weekend visits with his 10-year-old daughter, Nicole. But he is undaunted by the pace or the criticism.
"I love this job," he said. "I love talking with people. I love dealing with people. I've thought about running for higher office, like the Assembly, but debating social policy with 150 people in Albany just isn't as rewarding as blacktopping the street or rebuilding City Hall."
