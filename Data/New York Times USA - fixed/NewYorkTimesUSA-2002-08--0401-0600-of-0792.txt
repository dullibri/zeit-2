HEADLINE: Data Indicate U.S. Recovery Is Still Fragile 

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Consumer sentiment stabilized in early August after a summer stock market rout, but housing starts slipped in July from lofty levels even as mortgage rates fell, according to reports released yesterday. The data point to a steady but still-fragile recovery.
 Consumer inflation remained tame in July, a separate government report said, leaving the Federal Reserve ample room to cut interest rates should the recovery stall. 
 But for now, a halt in the slide in consumer sentiment provided some hope that consumer spending would continue to aid an economy beset by weak corporate profits, sluggish growth and a delay in job creation after last year's recession.
"Looking forward, consumers remain cautious in their outlook," said Lynn Reaser, chief economist at Banc of America Capital Management in St. Louis. "But with consumer confidence stabilizing, income rising and an improving stock market, consumers should be spending at a moderate pace."
The University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index edged down to 87.9 in early August, compared with a final 88.1 in July, holding at its lowest level since November. The drop was a bit lower than consensus forecasts for a reading of 88.3.
Separately, housing starts fell for a second month in July but remained at historically robust levels, down 2.7 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.649 million units, the Commerce Department said. That came after a revised 2.7 percent drop in starts in June, to a 1.695 million annual pace.
The Consumer Price Index, the main United States inflation gauge, rose just 0.1 percent last month after an identical advance in June, the Labor Department said. Excluding food and energy prices, which can vary widely from month to month, the core index was up 0.2 percent in July, after a 0.1 percent climb in June.
With inflation so tightly contained, economists say the Fed has room to lower its benchmark federal funds rate, already at a four-decade low of 1.75 percent, if it becomes necessary.
The summer's slide in consumer sentiment halted in early August as Americans took heart from the stock market's recent recovery from five-year lows in July and grew more upbeat about their current finances. That offset pervasive worries about the economy.
The steadying was driven entirely by a rise in the current-conditions component, which tracks consumers' views about their present financial situation.
The decline in housing starts in July, meanwhile, came after a strong showing in the spring and early summer and was mostly expected given that some builders would probably turn more cautious in light of the stock market woes. Historically low interest rates have helped to spur housing along for most of this year. 
Housing starts were off only 0.9 percent from the 1.664 million annual rate of a year ago. The June starts pace was also revised upward. Housing permits, an indicator of planned future construction, were off only slightly in July, dipping 0.5 percent, to a 1.698 million unit annual rate.

HEADLINE: Rethinking the Lessons of Journalism School 

BYLINE:  By Michael Janeway; Michael Janeway, director of the National Arts Journalism Program at Columbia University, is a former editor of The Boston Globe. He serves on the search committee for a new journalism dean at Columbia.

 BODY:
In the last century, professional education for law, business and medicine has undergone a transformation. Before the New Deal, for example, legal scholars at Yale and Harvard integrated analysis of economics and finance into the teaching of law (and then designed the first effective regulation of our market economy). After World War II, leading business schools began offering the M.B.A. degree to give their students a broader education in management and economics. Medical schools also moved on from trade-school models and began to engage with fields like ethics.
 Such conceptual reform has never occurred in journalism education. Its time is overdue -- but if the experience of Columbia University is any indication, it will be a difficult undertaking. 
 Last month Columbia's new president, Lee Bollinger, prompted criticism when he halted a search for a new dean for the university's Graduate School of Journalism, saying that the school needed to rethink its mission. "To teach the craft of journalism is a worthy goal," he said, but it is "clearly insufficient in this new world." He will appoint a task force to study the school's purpose and report its findings by the end of the year.
Rarely has the need for a well-informed society been so great. Yet in the last several decades the ability of news organizations to provide probing and insightful information has been compromised.
Driven by corporate imperatives like cost-cutting and revenue growth, whole sectors of the news business now tilt toward "infotainment" and soft features. Meanwhile, anyone with a public agenda employs teams of consultants to spin the news, making it harder to separate fact from pseudo-fact. And the need for expertise does not stop at the task of informed reaction. Event crowds out event -- Sept. 11 followed by Enron -- and serious news organizations do superb work reporting them. But discerning readers and viewers are right to ask why they aren't reading or watching reports on issues like terrorism or fraud before such stories break, not after.
At the same time, the best journalism is timeless and involves skills in reporting, judgment and critical thinking that need no New Deal. Many promising young journalists, often editors at undergraduate college newspapers, don't need graduate education the way their counterparts in law, business and medicine do, and the field carries no certification. Recognizing this, news organizations have never invested in journalism education the way corporate America invests in business schools.
Mr. Bollinger faces a dilemma. Society is changing, and the news business along with it. But the very transformations that make reform so urgent also work against it. There is a tension between the demands of society and the habits of the industry.
So what should Columbia and other journalism schools do? Training students for entry-level jobs is redundant; many universities offer such classes at the undergraduate level. The leading graduate programs in journalism, which can cost more than $30,000 a year, should add depth and value to a university education.
At Columbia, reforms in student recruitment, curriculum, financial aid and placement could combine to extend the length of the program (currently an airless, boot camp-like 10 months). Students could use the extra time to gain expertise in a variety of fields -- the sciences, economics, the environment, management, the arts. They may earn a joint degree. Or some new form of journalism education might evolve -- for example, urban sociology or international affairs, taught by experts in such fields who also present their work journalistically. (Speculation that Mr. Bollinger intends an injection of theory-driven "communications studies" into Columbia's program is without basis.) Columbia and other journalism schools might then be better able to attract those intelligent, ambitious young journalists who currently skip such programs altogether.
Such reform requires the collaboration of news industry leaders. Working with the university's other departments and with other innovative journalism schools, Columbia can create a vision for journalism education that moves it, finally, beyond what Mr. Bollinger has correctly diagnosed as its preoccupation with form and technique at the expense of depth and content.
By changing with the times, America's journalism schools can do more than just help an industry strengthen itself. They can also help create a truly informed public -- and thus serve the cause of democracy.

HEADLINE: Reward Miles Are Piling Up; Fliers May Face Future Squeeze 

BYLINE:  By JOE SHARKEY 

 BODY:
Americans are accumulating and cashing in frequent-flier miles at a record pace, scrambling for upgrades and free flights even as a dearth of paying customers has left the airlines losing billions of dollars.
 Experts say that the overall slowdown in travel is allowing airlines to partly accommodate a growing demand for free seats and upgrades. Customers have always complained about the difficulty of booking free trips for destinations and times they prefer, however, and that has not changed appreciably. 
 But steps that the industry is taking to cut its losses -- chopping back schedules, eliminating first-class and business-class seats on some flights, and replacing some bigger planes with smaller regional jets that do not even have first-class seating -- may make it harder than ever for frequent fliers to redeem their miles for trips when travel revives, these experts warn.
"The airlines are without a doubt creating a future customer-service liability for themselves," said Jim Corridore, an airline analyst for Standard & Poor's. 
Although air travel itself is off sharply this year, the rate of growth in miles accumulated under the frequent-flier programs has doubled this year, to about 20 percent, with a total of about 8.7 trillion miles outstanding, according to Randy Petersen, the publisher of InsideFlyer Magazine, who is considered the leading analyst of airline frequent-flier programs.
The number of free trips claimed by passengers in the last 12 months has, meanwhile, risen 17 percent. "That's the largest jump I've seen in the history of these programs," Mr. Petersen said.
The miles are piling up for several reasons. Airlines, desperately scrambling for every fraction of a percentage point of market share, are distributing mile awards essentially as a "loss leader," Mr. Corridore said. Several airlines, for example, offer bonuses of 1,000 to 2,000 miles for each ticket booked on their own Internet Web sites.
As the airlines scramble for revenue, a growing number of businesses, notably credit card companies and hotel chains, have joined in promotions to exploit what seems to be an endless consumer demand for free trips, upgrades and products including jewelry and concert tickets that airlines and partners are selling or discounting in exchange for miles. A free domestic trip typically requires 25,000 miles.
"Nothing in the history of these mileage programs has been as startling as what we've seen in the last few months" as credit card companies and others have been increasing promotions for bonus miles, Mr. Petersen said.
For example, American Express, which issues credit cards linked to the Delta Air Lines frequent-flier program, and Bank One Visa, which is in partnership with United Airlines, have been offering two airline miles for each dollar charged on their cards this summer. For a new cardholder's initial purchase alone, United's Mileage Plus Visa offers 15,000 bonus miles in addition to the double miles on subsequent charges.
Airline mileage partners purchase miles from airlines at 1 to 2 cents apiece, analysts said. In fact, with the rapid acceleration in participation in mileage programs, selling miles is one of the few money-making bright spots in the airline business today. Some analysts have even gone so far as to suggest that airlines spin off their frequent-flier divisions as separate companies.
With so many miles to be harvested, some of the most active participants in frequent-flier programs are going to great lengths to turn the industry's desperation into awards jackpots. Using the deeply discounted fares that airlines are offering on certain routes, they are booking complex, multistop trips to acquire the maximum number of miles and bonuses at the lowest possible cost.
"It's an us-against-them mentality," said Matthew Bennett, publisher of First Class Flyer, a newsletter based in Monterey, Calif., that highlights strategies for using mileage promotions to obtain upgrades. Mr. Bennett, who writes under the name Mr. Upgrade, estimated that if current trends toward using miles for upgrades continue, perhaps half of the miles redeemed on major airlines this year will be used for upgrades or outright purchases of first-class and business-class seats.
As miles pile up in customers' accounts, analysts worry that airlines -- which have been accounting for free trips for years at rates that typically average 7 to 8 percent of their total paid miles flown -- are failing to prepare for the inevitable time when mileage-rich customers are going to be demanding trips and upgrades for a good number of those newly generated miles.
They think that "they don't have to worry about it for a while," said Mr. Corridore, the Standard and Poor's airline analyst. "Right now, they're trying to get their revenues going at all costs."
But, he added, "if they get to the point where they have to say, 'You know, we're giving away too many free seats,' and they shortchange their frequent-flier programs, they're in for a major potential public relations backlash."
Grumbling about hard-to-book free trips for desirable destinations at desirable times has been chronic since the programs began in 1981, however. "It's not easy now to find availability" for free trips, Mr. Bennett said. "Then again, it's never been easy," he added.
Airlines, beyond what they report as potential award liabilities on their yearly financial statements, do not discuss specific mileage-program data, which they consider proprietary and highly competitive in nature. The major airlines all say that they are currently meeting or exceeding the usual levels of consumer demand for awards prevailing in recent years.
"We continue to have a very high success rate meeting demand," said Kurt Ebenhoch, a spokesman for Northwest Airlines.
A Delta spokesman said, "Our reward travel redemptions are increasing year to year."
With the continuing frenzy of promotions, however, the value of the mileage currency is bound to tumble eventually, critics said.
Airline miles are "the major inflationary currency in the world," said Gareth Edmondson-Jones, a spokesman for JetBlue Airways, an upstart carrier that is among the low-fare airlines bedeviling the major carriers. "It's a fairly worthless currency," he said. "You need to keep tripling and quadrupling points because they're worth less and less. It just looks more appealing as the numbers go up."
Still, even the no-frills carriers like JetBlue and Southwest Airlines, which have been making money while the major airlines lose billions, have their own mileage programs. Both Southwest's and JetBlue's programs are far less complex than those of the majors. They essentially award one free trip for a certain number of trips flown, much like a pizza parlor giving away a free pizza after a dozen purchases.
While the airlines stagger, some of the most active participants in the programs -- Americans number about 75 million of the approximately 100 million worldwide members -- are approaching their mileage-collecting and reward-redeeming with an intensity resembling the S&H Green Stamps mania of the 1950's and 1960's.
On FlyerTalk.com, a Web site that is part of Mr. Petersen's frequent-flier empire, chat rooms are filled with posts from members sharing strategies about so-called mileage runs -- the phenomenon of taking multiple airline trips not just to go somewhere but to generate as many miles as possible.
"You want to try to maximize your mileage accumulation while minimizing your cost outlay," said Kevin Vukson, a labor union organizer from California who uses the Internet to manage his miles, and often compares notes with other dedicated mileage accumulators online.
In June, Mr. Vukson said he went online and booked the following round-trip flight itinerary from his home near San Francisco: "Oakland to Los Angeles, to San Diego, and then on the red-eye to Chicago," he said. "Chicago to St. Louis, and back to Chicago. Down to New Orleans, up to Denver, and home to Oakland." Booking the red-eye overnight flight was to meet the United Airlines promotional fare's restriction of a one-night stay over.
At $125 for the total round-trip fare, and with a harvest of more than 8,000 frequent-flier miles, including bonus miles, on all of the legs flown, "it was the mother of all mileage runs," Mr. Vukson said.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; 
A Tangled Feud, Even by Indonesian Standards

BYLINE:  By RAYMOND BONNER 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, Aug. 11 

 BODY:
When business deals go sour in Indonesia, as they frequently do in a country where bribes to officials are a common cost of doing business and the judicial system is often neither just nor systematic, things can turn nasty, and expensive.
 The latest example is the feud between the Karaha Bodas Company, an energy concern partly owned by Florida Power and Light, a unit of the utility holding company FPL, and Pertamina, Indonesia's huge state-owned oil and gas company. 
 In 1994, when Indonesia was enjoying a bit of a boom and badly needed new sources of energy, the companies entered into a joint venture to build geothermal plants.
When currency and financial crises swept Asia three years later, the Suharto government suspended the venture, along with most other energy projects. 
Soon after, President Suharto was toppled, and the government that succeeded him scrapped the geothermal project altogether, amid allegations of corruption. That was the case with most major projects in the Suharto era, and to only a slightly lesser extent remains true today.
After Karaha, whose legal home is in the Cayman Islands, tried and failed to persuade the Indonesian government to revive the project, it sought compensation for the money it had already invested -- more than $100 million, it claimed -- and for lost profits.
In December 2000, an international tribunal in Geneva awarded Karaha $261 million. But Pertamina refused to pay, and remains adamant despite court rulings in Karaha's favor handed down since then in the United States, Hong Kong and Singapore.
When Secretary of State Colin L. Powell visited Jakarta recently, Indonesian officials laid out their side of the case, and there were reports in Indonesian newspapers afterward that he had offered to help settle the dispute. But an American diplomat here said the United States would remain neutral in the matter and would not intervene because there was no American tax money at risk.
As the feud has escalated, the only people profiting from it have been lawyers, lobbyists and image makers. Each side is spending $10 million to $20 million a year for all this help, a person working for one side estimated.
Karaha has retained the law firm of Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue and APCO, the Washington-based public relations and lobbying firm with offices around the world. Pertamina has hired the equally expensive lawyers at Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton, but a much smaller public relations firm in Washington, Potomac Communications. A third American legal powerhouse, White & Case, represents the Indonesian government, which owns Pertamina and is ultimately responsible for paying its obligations.
Even if the lawyers and lobbyists all worked free, though, the case would be a costly one for Indonesia, a country rich in resources like oil, gas, coal and timber but mired in economic stagnation and hungry for foreign investment. Karaha Bodas has been hitting Indonesia hard in this vulnerable spot.
"Pertamina's continuous disregard for U.S. and international law succeeds only in perpetuating the worst fears that many companies have about doing business in Indonesia," Christopher F. Dugan, a partner at Jones Day, said in a news release last month. APCO has kept up a steady stream of such releases pressing Karaha's side of the case.
Pertamina's public relations machine has been somewhat less aggressive, but the company is no less indignant about Karaha and its tactics, its lawyer said.
"They have set out from the outset to portray Indonesia as a pariah nation," said Matthew Slater, a partner at Cleary, Gottlieb.
Discussing the heart of the dispute, Mr. Slater called the arbitration decision flawed, both procedurally and substantively, and said that it was not in accord with an international treaty on the enforcement of arbitration awards.
A federal district court in Houston, acting on a suit brought by Karaha, rejected these arguments and upheld the award. Pertamina has appealed. The court in Texas has also held Pertamina in contempt for suing in the Indonesian courts to overturn the award.
Allegations of corruption and impropriety swirl around the deal, drawing in both Karaha and Pertamina.
The project involved "corruption, collusion and nepotism," the weekly newsmagazine Tempo said in a recent editorial that accompanied a long investigative article on the project.
Executives and diplomats say that it was virtually impossible to do business here during the Suharto years without greasing the skids by paying bribes to officials and giving members of the Suharto family and inner circle a cut of proposed deals. In this case, the allegations are that Karaha was awarded the project because Sumarah, a small company with no energy experience whose principal owner was related to the country's vice president at the time, had a 10 percent interest.
Karaha representatives said Pertamina had brought Sumarah into the deal. Mr. Slater, Pertamina's lawyer, said he did not know how Sumarah had become involved.
Karaha's lawyer, Mr. Dugan, called corruption allegations "a red herring" in the dispute with Pertamina. If there was any corruption in the geothermal project, he said, it did not involve Karaha. "We have not seen any evidence of corruption," he said.
Diplomats and executives say companies in the energy sector that do not want to pay bribes themselves often let Pertamina do the dirty work. For the moment, foreign energy companies cannot avoid Pertamina, because Indonesian law requires all foreign companies developing Indonesia's resources to set up partnerships with it. (The law is supposed to be phased out over the next few years.)
Mr. Slater said Pertamina had not engaged in any improper activities. "It played by the rules," he said.
Pertamina has made a settlement offer in the case, which Karaha rejected out of hand, in part because it would involve restarting the project.
"They don't trust Pertamina," Mr. Dugan said of his client, Karaha. "They don't trust the Indonesian government. They think they'd be foolish beyond description to go back in."

HEADLINE: Texas Board Revokes Andersen's License 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex., Aug. 16 

 BODY:
The accounting firm Arthur Andersen lost its license to practice in Texas today, the home state of its former client Enron.
 The state board that regulates the Texas accounting profession voted unanimously to revoke the firm's license because of the company's obstruction of justice conviction. 
 "Although it is tragic that a firm with Andersen's proud history in Texas should be brought so low, the firm's actions in the Enron case clearly warrant this result," said K. Michael Conaway, presiding officer of the Texas State Board of Public Accountancy. 
In June, a Houston jury convicted Andersen of obstruction of justice in a federal investigation of Enron's financial collapse. Enron filed for bankruptcy in December.
Richard Forrest, a lawyer who represented Andersen in the case before the state board, said the accounting and auditing firm, which is based in Chicago, was no longer practicing accounting in Texas. 
Andersen told the Securities and Exchange Commission after the June verdict that it would stop auditing public companies by Aug. 31. It has given up its licenses in other states, Mr. Forrest said. 
The company had agreed to the license revocation and a $1,000 fine, the maximum the state board could fine the company.

Household International has dodged the problems that have felled many other lenders to people with poor credit and low incomes. Now, though, a set of challenges will test its battle-hardened management.
 The threats include lawsuits claiming predatory lending, tougher lending laws in many states and greater regulatory scrutiny -- all at a time when a sagging economy could make it harder for many of its low-income customers to pay their bills. 
 Interviews with several Household borrowers and two former employees, as well as a critical report by a Washington State banking regulator that Household is trying to suppress, suggest that it will be hard to shake accusations of abusive loan practices despite the company's pledges of reform.
Concerns about its lending practices and the ability of its borrowers to repay their loans have sent Household shares down 35 percent this year, far more than the broad market. A $386 million downward restatement to earnings this week also cast a spotlight on the company's accounting, though investors quickly brushed off the modest revision. 
"If Household significantly alters its sales practices, product mix and loan pricing because of legal and regulatory pressure -- and that is a possibility -- earnings could slow," said William Ryan, consumer finance analyst at Portales Partners, a boutique brokerage firm in New York. 
Household, which is based outside Chicago in Prospect Heights, Ill., has extended $100 billion in loans to 50 million customers, many through two subsidiaries, Beneficial and the Household Finance Corporation. Its biggest business is making home loans at high interest rates to people with blemished credit histories, sometimes called the subprime market. In good times, and with careful selection, the business can be very profitable. But subprime loans can blow up quickly, and federal banking regulators are taking a tougher approach to the entire sector these days.
Providian, the nation's fifth-biggest credit card lender only two years ago, shrank rapidly after it spent more than $400 million to settle legal challenges and reported a sharp increase last year in loans past due. Conseco, the largest lender on mobile homes, has experienced a deterioration in credit quality and is fighting to avoid a bankruptcy filing. Metris, another credit card lender to people with low credit ratings, recently reported a loss, partly because of bad debts.
Despite the industry wreckage, though, Household is hanging tough. On a conference call with analysts this week, its chief executive, William F. Aldinger, dismissed as groundless two lawsuits filed by the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, or Acorn, a group that specializes in credit issues that affect low- and middle-income people.
Though nine states have enacted tougher laws against predatory lending in the last three years, Mr. Aldinger said these had had "virtually no impact" on Household because the company began two sets of changes in lending practices over the last 18 months. "We are a good group of people, a high-quality team with good ethics," Mr. Aldinger added.
Still, the complaints by Household borrowers suggest that the predatory lending storm will not blow over quickly.
On Sept. 12 last year, Lisa and Lou Sullivan of East Bridgewater, Mass., took out a $202,000 home equity loan at a Beneficial branch. The new loan was used to pay off a $153,000 Wells Fargo mortgage and $15,200 remaining on a previous Household loan. 
In a suit filed this week with other borrowers in Superior Court in Suffolk County, Mass., the Sullivans say that Household violated state law by failing to make proper disclosures.
Ms. Sullivan says that loan representatives at the Beneficial branch in Raynham, Mass., used confusing presentations to sell a loan that carried a far higher interest rate than the couple thought they were getting. In the branch, the loan representative said "that if we paid biweekly on the E-Z pay plan we'd really be paying 7 percent," Ms. Sullivan said. The loan carried an annual percentage rate of 12.3 percent, according to the Sullivans' loan documents.
Paying biweekly, the borrower makes 26 payments a year and pays out more each year than with a monthly contract. In this way, a borrower can pay off a 30-year loan in perhaps 20 years.
According to Ms. Sullivan, the loan representatives led her to believe that the interest rate could be as low as 7 percent if she chose the biweekly payment plan.
Household said it could not comment on the Sullivans' loan because of the pending suit.
The E-Z biweekly payment plan crops up frequently in complaints by Household borrowers, and a report by the Washington State Department of Financial Institutions says that, when presented in certain ways, it is confusing to borrowers.
The report, completed in April and based on loans made from 1999 to 2001, says sales representatives of Household Finance "employed sales tactics intended to mislead, misdirect or confuse the borrower." The department said that Household complaints had increased markedly over the last two years. It also said that the reports of abuses were widespread but singled out a branch in Bellingham, Wash., as having more than 30 percent of the complaints.
Two former Household loan officers who worked in a branch in the Northeast said the biweekly payment plan was used to confuse borrowers into thinking that they would get a lower rate. "It is the cornerstone of Household's sales pitch," one said. Both men, who left the company earlier this year, spoke on the condition of anonymity because they are still working in the field.
When asked about the Washington report on the conference call, Mr. Aldinger described it as "very inflammatory and very inaccurate." Household obtained a temporary restraining order to prevent the report from being released. It did not respond to a request for comment on the accusations in the report.
The Sullivans had enough equity in their house to go back to Wells Fargo and get a loan to pay off the Household loan. They had to pay a prepayment penalty of $11,279 and were not refunded the $14,695 paid in points and fees to Household. But Wells Fargo charged them a rate almost five percentage points lower than on the Household loan, suggesting that Household was above market rates. At Household, "they tried to say we were high risk," Ms. Sullivan said. 
According to the former loan representatives, Household staff members were guided in such practices. "We were trained to never tell people they have good credit," one loan officer said. "They have to feel like you're doing them a favor." 
Lisa Sodeika, vice president for consumer affairs at Household, said, "That contradicts all the things I hear and talk to our salespeople about."
Sales practices are the focus of Acorn's two lawsuits, which are seeking certification as class actions. In one suit, Acorn obtained an important victory in June when a federal district judge in California denied Household's effort to exclude borrowers who had signed documents agreeing to settle disputes through arbitration. The other suit was filed in May, in Cook County, Illinois.
Acorn has compiled reports on nearly 300 aggrieved Household borrowers, said Lisa Donner, the New York-based director of the group's Financial Justice Center. "Based on our experience, Household is the worst of the large lenders in the market," she said.
Household, which reported $1.9 billion in profit last year, could be hurt significantly if the suits succeed. In March, the First Alliance Mortgage Company, a bankrupt subprime mortgage lender, agreed to pay $60 million to settle a predatory lending case brought by the Federal Trade Commission involving 18,000 customers. Acorn's Illinois suit could be open to anyone who has taken out a secured loan from Household over the last three years. If 10 percent of Household's 3.2 million home-equity borrowers joined the suit and the payout was in line with the $3,300 paid to each First Alliance customer, damages could approach $1 billion.
Household has responded to critics by pledging a number of changes. Most recently, it said in February that it was going to limit points and fees to 5 percent of the mortgage. But some loans are still being made with higher points and fees. In April, Gregory Powe of Detroit refinanced a mortgage with Household Finance for $73,000, with $5,500 in origination fees, or more than 7 percent of the loan, according to his loan documents. It was used to pay off two previous Household loans and some small debts.
"They said my new loan would be at a lower rate," Mr. Powe said.
Loan documents show that the newest loan has a 13 percent rate, while the rate on one of the previous loans was 11.1 percent. "I was deceived, definitely," said Mr. Powe, who was also charged nearly $8,000 in single-premium credit insurance, nine months after the company said it was discontinuing the insurance product. Mr. Powe says Household refunded the $8,000 after Acorn took up his case.
Household said that even though Mr. Powe's loan documents showed a fee equivalent to 7 percent, he did not pay that much. Ms. Sodeika said fees were charged only on the difference between the new loan and the sum of the old ones. She was unable to say what fees were charged.
Household said in February that it would begin adopting a fee cap and other changes immediately, but it said this week that the fee limit would be in place by the end of the year.
When Household's top executives certified their financial results with the Securities and Exchange Commission this week, the company announced that it had restated net income since 1994, with a reduction of $386 million. The minor restatements, involving changes to the accounting treatment in the credit card business, arose from a review of Household's books by its new auditor, KPMG, which replaced Arthur Andersen this year. 
Mr. Ryan, the Portales analyst and a longtime critic of Household's accounting, urges investors to study the company's reserves against bad loans.
One of the most common ways to gauge the adequacy of reserves is to compare them with loans that are past due. Mr. Ryan says such calculations are difficult because Household allows many borrowers in distress to skip payments without classifying their loans as past due. The company says it gives such breaks to maximize collections. These loans, often called re-aged loans, represented 16.7 percent of total loans at the end of June, far more than the loans listed as past due.
Household has not supplied enough data on re-aged loans for a year earlier to show whether credit problems are rising sharply. It said that bad loans written off rose to an annual rate of 4.26 percent of total loans at the end of June, from 3.71 percent a year earlier, and that loans with payments more than 60 days past due rose to 4.53 percent from 4.27 percent.
"It would be very helpful to have re-aging data disclosed on a regular basis," said Moshe Orenbuch, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, who nevertheless has a strong buy on the stock.
When asked about re-aged loans and the reserve on the conference call, Mr. Aldinger and David A. Schoenholz, the chief operating officer and former chief financial officer, said their new auditors had found no problems with Household's reserve.
"Household's reserves are adequate," Megan E. Hayden, a spokeswoman, said in an e-mail message last Tuesday.

HEADLINE: New Child Welfare Head In Florida Is Drawing Fire 

BYLINE:  By DANA CANEDY 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Aug. 16 

 BODY:
Gov. Jeb Bush's appointee to head Florida's troubled child welfare agency is not even on the job yet and already the appointee, a former Oklahoma social services administrator and founder of a conservative Christian group, has come under fire.
 The latest controversy at the agency, the Florida Department of Children and Families, involves a 1989 religious essay which carries the name of Mr. Bush's appointee, Jerry Regier, on its cover. The essay, entitled "The Christian World View of The Family," supports spanking of children that may cause "temporary and superficial bruises and welts" and denounces abortion, parenting by gays and women in the work force. 
 Women, the essay says, should work outside the home only if the family is in a financial crisis and should consider such employment as "bondage."
The essay has led to calls from Democrats for Mr. Bush to withdraw his appointment of Mr. Regier and has put the governor's office in the position of having to do damage control on a move that itself was supposed to control damage.
The agency's previous director, Kathleen A. Kearney, resigned on Tuesday, after months of embarrassments, starting with the agency's admission in April that it had lost a child in its care, 4-year-old Rilya Wilson, without noticing for more than a year.
Mr. Bush's office issued a statement on Mr. Regier's behalf today, in which Mr. Regier tried to distance himself from the essay and the group that published it, the Coalition on Revival of Fresno, Calif. While his name appears on the essay, excerpts of which were published today in The Miami Herald, Mr. Regier said he was not an author of it.
Mr. Regier is the founder of another conservative religious organization, the Family Research Council in Washington, but he said he was merely a co-chairman of the Coalition on Revival when it published the paper and had severed his association with the group years ago because of some of its extremist views.
Mr. Regier's name, though, still appears on the Revival Coalition's Web site as a member of the group's national steering committee.
"While not compromising my core principles, certainly, as it relates to this paper, there is much content and Biblical interpretation held by members of the Coalition on Revival with which I do not agree," Mr. Regier said in his statement. "In my 20 years of service in the area of children and families, I have never been soft on child abuse or wavered in the protection of children, so it is not my position that corporal punishment should result in welts or bruises."
Mr. Regier's statement made no mention of his views on abortion or parenting by gays, which has been a high-profile issue in Florida because of a state law prohibiting gay individuals and couples from adopting.
Of his views on working women, Mr. Regier said: "My own wife of 34 years is a registered nurse, and I am extremely supportive of her career. I support women in the work force as well as women holding an equal role in marriage."
Child welfare advocates and Mr. Bush's political foes said the fact that the governor was caught off guard by Mr. Regier's association with the coalition proved that Mr. Bush had acted too hastily in replacing Ms. Kearney. After her resignation, agency critics urged Mr. Bush to convene a panel to conduct a national search for her replacement.
Instead, Mr. Bush, who is seeking re-election in November, announced Mr. Regier's appointment two days later, on Thursday. His critics now say he did not sufficiently review Ms. Kearney's successor and made the appointment for political expediency. Mr. Regier served in the first federal Bush administration as head of the National Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention.
"I am stunned that the governor, after such scandal involving the last agency head, would not take more deliberate steps toward finding a more suitable replacement," said state Representative Frederica Wilson, a child welfare advocate and Miami Democrat in whose district Rilya was living when she vanished. "Appointing Regier has created another major problem for our state."
Mr. Bush's office said the governor had no knowledge of the essay before he named Mr. Regier, but declined to comment further. Mr. Regier did not return calls.
Representatives for the Coalition on Revival could not be reached. The group's Web site says its mission is to "help the Church rebuild civilization on the principles of the Bible so God's will may be done on earth as it is in heaven."
Mr. Bush's political adversaries wasted little time contending that he had put the fate of Florida's most vulnerable children in the hands of a right-wing extremist.
The state Democratic Party called on the governor to withdraw the appointment and begin a new search for a replacement for Ms. Kearney. Janet Reno, the former United States attorney general who is seeking the Democratic nomination for governor, questioned whether the controversy would render Mr. Regier ineffective in his new job.
"With all of the challenges facing DCF, one would think that the governor would pick someone who would not be a lightning rod for controversy or divert attention from the work that needs to be done," she said.
The controversy is not likely to be decisive in the governor's race, one expert on Florida politics said, but is another embarrassment for Mr. Bush and dashes any hopes he had of putting a positive spin on Ms. Kearney's exit.
"Any expectation that this will be a smooth appointment just went out the window," said Susan MacManus, a political scientist at the University of South Florida. "It leaves Floridians as frustrated as ever with DCF."

Treasury to Ban Technique Used to Reduce Tax Bill
The Treasury Department banned a technique that thousands of the wealthiest Americans have used to escape billions of dollars in gift and estate taxes. The technique involves buying expensive life insurance that will be passed on to heirs, but declaring a far lower price on gift-tax returns.
 The department said the technique was not valid and never had been, leading experts on taxes and insurance to predict that people who have bought these policies will be drawn into years of litigation with the government and with their advisers. Page A1. 

4-Week Run for Dow and S.& P. 500

A group of record companies is asking a federal judge in New York to order four large Internet service providers to block Americans from viewing a China-based Web site that offers thousands of copyrighted songs free. The companies say the site, Listen4ever.com, is "even more egregious" than the Napster music-sharing service, which was shut down by a court order. C4.

Data Point to Fragile Recovery
Consumer sentiment stabilized in early August after a summer stock market rout but housing starts slipped in July from lofty levels even as mortgage rates fell, reports said, pointing to a steady but still-fragile recovery.

HEADLINE: Golisano Attacks Pataki on Conservative Issues 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

 BODY:
The muted primary contest between Gov. George E. Pataki and Tom Golisano flared yesterday, as Mr. Golisano launched an advertising barrage against the governor and the Pataki camp accused him of lying.
 Mr. Golisano continued to be plagued by the travails of his lieutenant governor candidate, Daniel F. Mahony, who dropped out of the race yesterday by moving to Connecticut and declined to answer questions in court about whether or not he had voted twice in an election. 
 With just 25 days until he competes with Mr. Pataki in the Independence and Conservative Party primaries, Mr. Golisano, a billionaire businessman making his third run for governor, mounted his first serious attack on the Republican incumbent, with three new ads being broadcast in every part of the state.
Two of the ads take aim at Mr. Pataki's image as a tax-cutter and a good economic steward, a central part of his political identity and his appeal to the fiscally conservative voters Mr. Golisano hopes to win over. The third ad assails the governor's efforts to keep Mr. Golisano and his allies out of the primaries, reminding voters of a similar attempt to knock Senator John McCain out of New York's 2000 presidential primary. That episode hurt Mr. Pataki's popularity.
Until now, most of Mr. Golisano's advertising has been designed to reintroduce him to the voters as a successful entrepreneur. He has had only one ad critical of the governor. He said he would spend $75 million on this race, and is already outspending the other candidates by far. His chief political consultant, Roger Stone, would not say how much was being spent on the three new ads, but said, "We're putting them up at saturation levels, a very heavy buy."
The Pataki campaign responded that most of the ads' charges were false.
"He should take those ads down because they are simply lies," said Adam Stoll, the governor's campaign manager. "He has his running mate fleeing the state to avoid charges. He's running completely misleading and false ads. His candidacy is really just making a mockery of the system."
One Golisano charge, that New York has lost 300,000 jobs under Mr. Pataki, employed an unusual method of counting job loss. The Golisano campaign said it was based on new filings for unemployment insurance in months when the unemployment rate climbed.
According to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, New York had just over nine million people working in June, the most recent month for which figures were available. That was an increase of 385,100 from December 1994, the month before Mr. Pataki took office.
The official numbers cast the governor in a much better light than the Golisano ads, but they are hardly flattering to Mr. Pataki. Employment has grown in New York at about half the national rate during the governor's tenure, and that was the case even before the Sept. 11 attack. The number of employed people has grown, but so has the number of unemployed, by 80,500, and the unemployment rate is higher now, 5.9 percent versus 5.4 percent.
The Pataki campaign and its allies are deeply concerned about Mr. Golisano, seeing him as the biggest threat to a campaign that has looked, so far, like a runaway for the two-term governor.
Mr. Pataki's forces attempted, at the Conservative and Independence Party conventions, to keep Mr. Golisano from mounting primary challenges. They have gone to court to knock two lieutenant governor candidates allied with Mr. Golisano out of those primaries. That case is pending.
In separate suits, they have claimed that people who circulated Mr. Golisano's nominating petitions were not legally entitled to do so, and that his loans to other candidates might be illegal. And they have spent considerable effort and money trying to enroll new voters in the Independence Party, which Mr. Golisano founded, to dilute his base of support.
"Anybody with $75 million, who keeps saying George Pataki isn't a conservative, who keeps making deceitful attacks on the governor, is a threat," said Michael R. Long, chairman of the Conservative Party and an important Pataki ally. "Their aim is to make sure that George Pataki doesn't win. Can they do that? I don't believe so. But can they cause us some heartaches? Yeah, sure. They already have."
In terms of issues and alliances, Mr. Pataki has seized much of the terrain normally occupied by Democrats. If he won his primaries, the governor would face a two-way race against a Democrat -- H. Carl McCall or Andrew M. Cuomo -- over whom he would have an enormous advantage in money.
But a primary loss would create a far more difficult three-way race in which Mr. Golisano would have the financial advantage, and Mr. Pataki would be under high-volume assault from the left and the right.
The Republican lawsuit over nominating petitions took an unexpected turn yesterday in state court in Albany, when Mr. Mahony was called to testify, and announced that he had moved to Connecticut. Under state law, a name can only be removed from the ballot if a candidate dies, moves out of state or is nominated for a judgeship.
Voting records suggested that Mr. Mahony, formerly of Manhattan, voted twice in two different elections, and he is under investigation by the New York City Board of Elections and the Manhattan district attorney's office. Under questioning yesterday by lawyers for the Pataki camp, he repeatedly refused to answer, citing his right not to incriminate himself, then left the courthouse without answering reporters' questions.
What his departure means is far from clear. The court has not yet ruled on the validity of Mr. Mahony's petitions to enter the Conservative primary or William Neild's petitions to enter the Independence primary. Both men are allied with Mr. Golisano, and both were challenging Mary Donohue, the Republican incumbent who is Mr. Pataki's running mate.
If the petitions are upheld, officials in both camps said, it appears that state election law allows Mr. Mahony's campaign to pick someone to take his place in the primary -- a rule so obscure that even election lawyers were unaware of it until this morning. Golisano advisers said a likely replacement would be Mary Lou Shanahan, a Conservative Party member from Staten Island.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 22, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about advertisements by Tom Golisano's campaign for governor, including a commercial contending that jobs have been lost under Gov. George E. Pataki, misstated the increase in the number of jobs in New York State since Mr. Pataki took office in January 1995. According to seasonally adjusted employment figures from the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, the measure used by most economists, the gain was 677,500 jobs, not 385,100.

HEADLINE: Primary in New Assembly District Draws Disparate Candidates 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
On any given recent weekend, it has been difficult to ignore the distinct sights and sounds of politics amid the street fairs, block parties and parades in the University Heights section of the Bronx.
 That is because that part of the Bronx is the scene of a race for a newly-drawn seat in the State Assembly, one for which there is hearty competition between two relatively new faces to elective politics. In choosing between the two candidates seeking the Democratic nomination in this heavily Democratic area, the voters in the new 86th Assembly District will nonetheless decide between candidates with long and vastly different political histories. 
 In Luis M. Diaz, they will find the soft-spoken executive director of a nonprofit organization that provides programs for both young and elderly residents. Mr. Diaz, 49, has also been a longtime loyal foot soldier in the Bronx Democratic Party organization, serving as a Democratic district leader and as an aide to Assemblyman Peter Rivera. 
In Yudelka Tapia, 38, voters will find a longtime civic leader steeped in marches and protests. Ms. Tapia is a vigorous woman who has led demonstrations on everything from support of rent control laws and better safety measures for livery taxi drivers to immigration amnesty for Hispanic residents. And she has been active in parent associations in the area.
The campaign is being played out in a densely populated area that also includes the Tremont and Morris Heights sections of the Bronx, the home of Bronx Community College. The district is home to the large apartment complexes along the Grand Concourse and vibrant commercial strip of Fordham Road, with its hodgepodge of shops selling everything from inexpensive clothes and budget electronics to fragrant arroz con pollo to discount airline tickets to Santo Domingo. And it is there that the two candidates are taking their messages to voters, with sound trucks and visits to any community event that will have them. 
It is a district whose population is two-thirds Hispanic, mostly longtime residents who came from Puerto Rico and newer immigrants from the Dominican Republic. Non-Hispanic black residents account for about 27 percent of the district.
It is also an area that is home to many of the poorest of New York City's residents, where joblessness is as common as concerns about adequate health care.
The centerpiece of Mr. Diaz's campaign is the need to improve economic conditions in the district. He talks about using the Assembly position to seek to bring to the district more programs to assist struggling business owners and to develop strategies to increase housing for low-income residents.
"I want to make sure that this community is not forgotten by the powers in Albany," he said. "I want to make sure that economic development in communities like this becomes a top priority. That's how you ensure that everyone is helped."
Ms. Tapia discusses the need for more health care facilities in the district, as well as the need for more youth programs and for rehabilitating the schools in the district. "I'm the mother of four boys," she said, "and I know that we need more programs for our children. We have only one hospital in this district and not many community health centers. We have to do better."
One thing the candidates have in common is that they have offered few specifics on how they would solve the problems that they highlight.
But they are specific on how they perceive the other's shortcomings. In particular, Ms. Tapia takes her opponent to task for not being a longtime resident of the district, pointing out that Mr. Diaz served as a Democratic district leader in the Parkchester section of the Bronx.
"He has never really lived in this district," she said. "I have been here for 14 years. I know the issues in the community and the people in this community know me. I have been in every significant struggle with the people of this community. And he just has not."
Mr. Diaz points out that that he moved into the district within the last few months and that, in years when the Legislature changes the district boundaries, candidates are not required to live in the district where they run.
In addition, he said, "The issues and concerns in one part of the Bronx are no different than in another."
Of his opponent, Mr. Diaz said, "She does not have the experience that I have." And he added, "I have 20 years of experience working with elected officials and running a nonprofit organization that serves the community. She doesn't have a record like that."
While Ms. Tapia's supporters portray Mr. Diaz as the consummate political machine insider, Mr. Diaz's supporters are even quicker to describe Ms. Tapia as divisive.
They point out that as a candidate for City Council last year, Ms. Tapia led demonstrations protesting the organization's effort to have her removed from the ballot by challenging the number of valid signatures on her petitions. (Ms. Tapia's name was restored on the ballot but she was later removed because of a failure on the part of her campaign to file a form.) 
It was during those demonstrations, Mr. Diaz's supporters contend, that Ms. Tapia, who was born in the Dominican Republic, accused the Democratic Party leaders and Fernando Ferrer, then the Bronx borough president, of being anti-Dominican. She has denied making such a charge.

HEADLINE: Navistar Posts Quarterly Loss 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WARRENVILE, Ill., Aug. 16 

 BODY:
The truckmaker Navistar International reported its third consecutive quarterly loss today, citing soft demand and a labor strike, and predicted another down quarter before profits return.
 Navistar surprised investors by warning it would post a fourth-quarter loss because demand for medium-duty trucks, dampened by the sluggish economy, had failed to bounce back in the second half of the year as the company had hoped. 
The company reported a loss in the fiscal third quarter ended July 31 of $16 million, or 27 cents a share, in contrast to a profit of $2 million, or 3 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Sales were little changed at $1.6 billion.
Navistar said fourth-quarter results would also be hurt by lower income from its financing operations, higher pension expenses and start-up costs of more than $20 million to produce a new engine for Ford Motor's heavy-duty pickup trucks.
It also said it might post a fourth-quarter revamping charge as it looks for further cost reductions and closes a body plant and an assembly line in Springfield, Ohio.
The company, which is based in Warrenville, Ill., said unusual items in the third quarter totaled $30 million pretax, or 31 cents a share after taxes.

HEADLINE: THE AD CAMPAIGN; 
Challenging Pataki's Record

BYLINE:  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

 BODY:
 In his first serious attacks on Gov. George E. Pataki during this campaign, Tom Golisano, a third-party candidate for governor, unveiled three new ads yesterday. His campaign said the television ads, one 60 seconds long and the others 30 seconds, are to be broadcast heavily in all markets statewide.

PRODUCERS -- Roger Stone and Erick Mullen

ON THE SCREEN -- One ad begins with a shot of Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, before a cheering, flag-waving crowd, followed by a newspaper headline, "Pataki Campaign Is Suing Golisano." Another starts by showing a series of written messages about the governor's economic record, labeled, alternately, "Pataki Myth" and "Truth." But the bulk of the images in all three ads are of Mr. Golisano in a suit, sitting behind a desk in an office, leaning forward on his elbow and talking directly into the camera.

THE SCRIPTS -- Two of the three ads are devoted to attacking Mr. Pataki's economic record. The longer one begins with a voice-over, while a 30-second ad goes directly to Mr. Golisano.

Voice-over: "George Pataki says he's cut taxes. The truth: Under Pataki, the tax burden on New Yorkers has gone up. He says he's created jobs. New York has lost 300,000 jobs since he became governor. Pataki says he's a conservative. Yet state debt and borrowing are up to $100 billion. After eight years of special interests, spending is up 45 percent."
Mr. Golisano: "I know people are worried. They see the value of their retirement savings evaporating, taxes increasing, young people leaving the state to find jobs. As governor, I'll bring fiscal discipline to Albany, and say no to the special interests. We can reduce spending, cut taxes and create good jobs for New Yorkers."
The third ad assails efforts to knock Mr. Golisano out of the race.
Voice-over: "Remember when George Pataki tried to keep Senator John McCain off the presidential ballot in New York? Now he's trying to do the same to Tom Golisano."
Mr. Golisano: "Why would a sitting governor interfere with the democratic process? Why wouldn't George Pataki support an honest and fair election? We should be focusing on how to make New York State a better place to live. Together, we can make it happen."

ACCURACY -- Spotty. The charges about state spending, debt and taxes are more or less accurate, though, as always, there is room to quibble about definitions. But others stretch the truth considerably. Most questionable is the claim of job losses under Mr. Pataki, which the Golisano campaign bases on new claims for unemployment insurance filed in months when the unemployment rate rose. That is an unusual way to figure job losses. The most recent federal government statistics show that in June there were 381,500 more jobs in New York than in December 1994, the month before the governor took office. However, there were also 80,500 more people unemployed, and the unemployment rate was higher. Employment grew much more slowly in New York than the rest of the country over the last eight years, but it grew. If there is a problem with the ad about ballot access, it is one of verb tense. The Pataki forces are trying to keep lieutenant governor candidates out of the Independence and Conservative Party primaries, and they tried to do the same to Mr. Golisano recently, but there are no current efforts to knock Mr. Golisano out of those primaries.

SCORECARD -- The ads take direct aim at the Republican governor's signature claim, to be a fiscally prudent tax-cutter, and at one of his great strengths, his image as a nice guy. Despite the Pataki camp's complaints about falsehoods, Mr. Golisano has enough money to saturate the airwaves with his charges that he may be able to make them stick. Public opinion polls show no sign that most voters hunger for the tax and spending cuts Mr. Golisano promises, but he is really aiming only at those on the right, a segment Mr. Pataki could otherwise take for granted. The McCain episode hurt the governor's popularity, and the charge that he is once again not playing fair could be damaging. Mr. Golisano comes across as amiable and reasonable, but the ads do nothing to loosen up his stiff image. RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

HEADLINE: The Waco Road to Baghdad 

BYLINE:  By FRANK RICH; E-mail: frankrich@nytimes.com

 BODY:
George W. Bush tossed the nation's press a softball and they hit it out of the park. There was not a single good review, not even from his minions at The Wall Street Journal editorial page, for the White House's feel-good-about-your-401(k) jamboree at Waco. It was a "forum," the critics suggested, in the sense that the Politburo was a "legislature." Only Mr. Bush, who is on record as having loved "Cats," pronounced the event a "great show." 
 But it's Mr. Bush who was right. What his critics miss is that by this administration's standards of governance, Waco was a triumph. It was expressly designed to be content-free (rather like "Cats," in fact). The goal was never to produce policy but solely to serve up a video bite of Mr. Bush looking engaged by the woes of what his chief of staff, Andrew Card, referred to on CNN as "so-called real Americans." If the White House wanted anyone to listen, it would not have staged eight separate panels simultaneously on a Tuesday morning in the dog days of August, assuring that complete coverage would be available only on C-Span. 
 For those few viewers who dipped in, the spectacle was not unamusing. On one panel, Mr. Bush could be found in mutual fawning with his campaign contributor "Chuck" Schwab -- Charles to us -- no doubt oblivious to the fact that Chuck had just placed a nose behind Enron's Ken Lay and Global Crossing's Gary Winnick on Fortune's "Greedy Bunch" list of those executives who cashed out the most stock before their companies' shares tanked by 75 percent or more. Yet even this touching tableau, on a day when Schwab was laying off nearly 400 employees, did not stop CNN, MSNBC and Fox News from switching to such alternative programming as a picturesque natural gas explosion in a suburban California house. 
What makes the morning-after outrage of the nation's commentariat seem a bit over the top is that the preordained hollowness of the Waco show is not news. This is how this administration always governs. Mr. Bush has two inviolate, one-size-fits-all policies (if obsessions can be called policies): the tax cut (for domestic affairs) and "regime change" in Iraq (foreign affairs). Everything else is a great show designed to provide the illusion of administration activity when it has no plan. 
The show takes the form not only of the Orwellian slogans emblazoned on the backdrops ("Small Investors/Retirement Security" loomed above the president and Chuck in Waco) but also of bogus announcements of muscular action. At the forum's final curtain, the president declared that he would teach Congress a tough lesson about fiscal responsibility by holding back $5.1 billion it had appropriated for such low-priority items as equipment for firefighters and health monitoring at ground zero. But what about the $190 billion in wasteful farm subsidies he has already thrown to the winds? Besides, he would have to cut spending by $5 billion five days a week for more than a year to compensate for the red ink of his $1.35 trillion tax cut.
Though the president's harshest critics think he's stupid, I've always maintained that the real problem is that he thinks we are stupid. He never doubts that his show will distract us from bad news. Waco was supposed to make us forget the latest round of economic headlines: stagnant wages, slowed growth, new all-time records in personal bankruptcies and consumer borrowing. All this is on top of a falloff in the Dow that The Economist measures as identical in percentage to that of Herbert Hoover's first 18 months, which included the crash of '29. 
Well, the economy is only money. It's when the same governance technique is applied to life-and-death matters like war and domestic security that the farce curdles. Here, too, there are new headlines the administration wants us to forget. At the F.B.I., a Los Angeles Times investigation revealed, the prehistoric computer system remains in disarray even as the agency's top executives are either pushed out or flee for private employment (as the counterterrorism chief abruptly did on Thursday). The Wall Street Journal discovered that when the federal government issued a terrorist warning to shopping centers four months ago, the Mall of America learned about it only by watching CNN. Not only are our airlines collapsing but, according to Thursday's USA Today, so is the undercover air marshal program that was supposed to be strengthened after Sept. 11. One marshal called it "a laughingstock." 
And what does the administration propose as a solution? Last week John Ashcroft went on TV to announce what he calls the "first ever White House conference on missing and exploited children." It takes an exploiter to know one. F.B.I. figures show a decline in the kidnapping of children -- except on cable TV. But if you can't crack the anthrax case, why not create some distracting hysteria by glomming onto a local law enforcement issue that is the biggest showbiz phenomenon since shark attacks? The administration loves the bait-and-switch. It hyped the cases of "the American Taliban," John Walker Lindh, and the "dirty bomber," Jose Padilla, to cover for its failure to snare the actual Taliban leader, Mullah Omar, and the actual bomber, Osama bin Laden, much as it has hyped the perp walks of second-rung executives from WorldCom to make us forget about Halliburton, Harken and Ken Lay.
Next stop: Iraq. Just as a tax cut is billed as the miracle antidote to every possible economic ill -- "We've got the best tax policy in the world!" Mr. Bush said at Waco -- so we're asked to believe that taking out Saddam Hussein will bring democracy to Iraq and the rest of the Arab world, miraculously repair the chaos wrought by our disengagement from the Middle East and win the war on terrorism all at once. The silver bullet that gets Saddam, it appears, will cure all international ills with the possible exception of the arrogance of the French. 
While Saddam is an authentic genocidal monster, there are more plausible links between Al Qaeda and our dear friend Saudi Arabia than between Al Qaeda and Saddam; it could be argued that toppling him would strengthen Al Qaeda. But what the administration is mainly hoping is that a march on Baghdad will make us forget about Al Qaeda, wherever it may be lying in wait. It's not good P.R. for our war on terrorism that Islamic terrorists have been linked to eight attacks abroad since Daniel Pearl's murder in January, including the assassination of the Afghan vice president in Kabul and the slaughter of an American diplomat, among others, at a church in Islamabad. 
The White House keeps saying that no decision has been made about Iraq, but of course a decision has been made. Richard Perle, an administration Iraq hawk, gave away the game in yesterday's Times: "The failure to take on Saddam after what the president said" would lead to "a collapse of confidence." Translation: If Mr. Bush doesn't get rid of Saddam after all this saber rattling, he will look like the biggest wimp since -- well, his father. Democrats, as timid in challenging Mr. Bush on Iraq as they were in letting his tax cut through Congress, keep calling for a "debate." What world are they living in? Mr. Bush is no sooner going to abandon his pursuit of Saddam than his crusade to eliminate the estate tax. These are his only core beliefs. 
The questions left to be debated now are who's going to pay for the war, who's going to be killed in it, who's going to police what could be a decade-long cleanup. (So far the answer to all three seems to be first and foremost: the go-it-alone Americans.) The loudest voices asking these questions are almost exclusively Republican: Brent Scowcroft, Chuck Hagel, Henry Kissinger, even Dick Armey. "If you think you're going to drop the 82nd Airborne on Baghdad and finish the job," said Senator Hagel, a Vietnam war hero, two weeks ago, "I think you've been watching too many John Wayne movies."
What's been most remarkable about the Iraq project so far is how an administration as effectively secretive as this one could spring so many leaks of invasion scenarios to the press. It strains credulity to assert that this is all an ingenious conspiracy to fake out Saddam. The leaks fake us out instead, inuring us to the new war to come. 
The only mystery is when D-Day will be. Given the administration's history, I'd guess that it will put on the big show as soon as its political self-preservation is at stake. Certainly the White House's priorities are clear enough. It has guarded the records of Dick Cheney's energy task force and the S.E.C. investigation of Harken far more zealously than war plans that might endanger the lives of the so-called real Americans who will have to fight Saddam.

HEADLINE: Bush Considers New Measures In a Bid to Boost the Economy 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 16 

 BODY:
President Bush said today that he was considering a package of new steps to aid the economy and investors, illustrating the growing concern at the White House about the stock markets' fall and the possibility of another recession.
 Mr. Bush said he had not settled on specifics, and it was unclear how far he might go in adding to his existing economic agenda, which centers on making permanent the tax cut passed last year, pursuing trade agreements, making it easier for oil companies to drill in the United States and providing companies with access to insurance against terrorism. 
 But in remarks to reporters near his ranch in Crawford, Tex., Mr. Bush said he was intrigued by some ideas set out at his economic forum this week, and planned to review them with an eye toward pushing some forward when Congress returns to work after Labor Day.
"We're thinking about all options," Mr. Bush said. "That's one of the things that came out of the meeting, was that some have urged us to think about additional measures to help growth, so I'm thinking about it."
The president said he would study the possibilities "so that when I announce them, it will be well thought out, it will be part of a long-term plan."
He cited a variety of possibilities that were raised by participants at the forum, most of which have been studied in the past by Mr. Bush's economic team and Republicans in Congress. They included increasing the amount of capital losses individuals can use to offset their taxes, allowing people to contribute more to their 401(k) retirement plans and reducing taxes on dividends.
Administration officials had previously signaled that they were unlikely to pursue any major new economic initiatives this year, especially given the growing federal budget deficit. But the fall of the stock markets this summer and the growing concern among Republicans that their party could suffer on Election Day if the economy continues to weaken have put the issue back on the table.
Should the president go ahead with a new plan, it would probably be well received by Republicans on Capitol Hill. Ron Bonjean, a spokesman for Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the minority leader, said, "Helping investors, protecting pensions and generating market confidence are top priorities for us."
The Democratic reaction is likely to hinge on whether the assistance would help lower- and middle-income people as well as upper-income investors and on how expensive the proposals prove to be.
Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of New York, said this week that Mr. Bush should focus on extending unemployment benefits further.
At the economic forum on Tuesday and again today, Mr. Bush appeared particularly interested in a proposal to increase to as much as $20,000, from $3,000, the limit on deductibility of capital losses. 
Mr. Bush also focused on a proposal to eliminate the double taxation of dividends. Currently, companies are taxed on the earnings that they use to pay dividends to shareholders, and that money is then taxed again when it is paid out to shareholders.

HEADLINE: For Venezuela, A Move Revives To Oust Chavez 

BYLINE:  By JUAN FORERO 

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, Aug. 16 

 BODY:
The wide streets and white-washed houses in this city's affluent east end are deceptively calm, with tropical birds and lush mango trees providing a country feel just minutes from the chaotic downtown.
 But here in the Sorocaima neighborhood, residents are preparing for the worst: a possibly violent confrontation between the multitudes of poor who support the country's mercurial president, Hugo Chavez, and his increasingly restive opponents. Taking precautions, the neighborhood's people have put up razor wire and electrified fences, set up citizen patrols, erected street barricades and purchased arms. 
 "We are worried that in a state of desperation, the government will call for a riot," explained Bruno Scheuren, 58, a publicist who, like virtually everyone in this part of the city, opposes Mr. Chavez. "Many people are afraid." 
Four months after Mr. Chavez was briefly ousted in a violent uprising, trouble is stirring again as Venezuelan society has grown more polarized, and both the president's supporters and his adversaries talk of looming conflict. Although the president and his foes had vowed to reconcile after he returned to power, two days after his ouster, efforts at dialogue have faltered. 
Now, a once-fragmented opposition is starting to meld into a coherent front and is embarking on new efforts to remove Mr. Chavez from office. They include pushing for a national referendum on his presidency in August 2003, and demanding criminal charges against him in the deaths of civilian protesters in the April 11 street disturbances that led to his temporary downfall.
But some of Mr. Chavez's opponents now speak privately of another uprising to topple a leader they accuse of dividing Venezuela with his left-leaning policies and confrontational manner. His supporters, mostly impoverished Venezuelans who say he has given them a voice they never had, vow to use force in his defense.
The situation is increasingly worrisome to the United States, which depends on Venezuela for 1.5 million barrels of oil a day. Bush administration officials said that unless the two sides renewed talks soon, Venezuela could spiral into violence.
"Unless there is a meaningful national dialogue, and unless that dialogue starts really soon, then there is a very good chance Venezuela will blow again," said an administration official who follows events in Venezuela.
The upheaval in April was followed by days of soul searching. Mr. Chavez apologized for his often incendiary language and promised to open talks with opponents. His foes, ranging from Venezuela's largest labor union to its biggest business association, promised to listen. 
Mr. Chavez soon took some steps that were welcomed by the business class. He appointed a new economic team, replaced the president of the state-owned oil company who was seen as his crony, and pledged that the National Assembly would reconsider several economic laws opposed by entrepreneurs.
But opponents now charge that the government's actions have been half-hearted. A presidential committee set up to advance the talks has largely dissolved, with key opposition figures dropping out, saying their complaints were not heard. The opposition also charged that Mr. Chavez had continued to adopt policies that hamper business and the state oil company.
"The game is over because the president says one thing and does another," Carlos Fernandez, president of the country's largest business association, Fedecamaras, said, referring to the talks. "The president in the last few weeks is back to his old self." 
To many opposition lawmakers and business leaders, the only option now is to remove Mr. Chavez, a process they acknowledge could lead to violence. 
"I have no doubt we could enter into a civil war, a fight between brothers," said Gerardo Blyde, a member of the National Assembly and a Chavez foe. "We have all the ingredients for that war: intolerance, sectarianism, exclusion and the incompetence to resolve the problems." 
To strengthen its efforts, the disjointed opposition formed, in June, a group called the Democratic Coordinator. Though its members include the once powerful Democratic Action Party, Fedecamaras, and representatives of labor and the Communist Red Flag Party, it is united behind the goal of ousting Mr. Chavez.
With the advice of lawyers and public relations experts, the group has embarked on a legal effort to cut short Mr. Chavez's presidency. The main strategy is to prod the Supreme Court into investigating him for the deaths of the 18 people in the April protests and for what they call mismanagement of public funds.
The president's foes were emboldened when the Supreme Court on Wednesday dismissed charges against four military officers the government had accused of rebelling against Mr. Chavez in April.
The two sides have not ruled out negotiations. In recent days, both the government and the opposition extended invitations for the Carter Center, former president Jimmy Carter's Georgia-based group, the Organization of American States and the United Nations to choose a representative to help open talks.
But an effort by Mr. Carter to broker talks between Mr. Chavez and his opposition during a visit last month ended when the opposition refused to meet him. Foreign observers who closely follow events here say the acrimony on both sides has weakened the possibility for fruitful talks. 
Indeed, Mr. Chavez and his supporters see many of his opponents as mere coup plotters, while opponents often speak of Mr. Chavez as a fascist or lunatic. 
"It's polarized to the extent of mutual contempt bordering on hatred, so you have people who refuse to even talk to other people," said a Western diplomat in Caracas. 
Some members of the Democratic Coordinator continue to hold out in private the possibility of a coup by officers of a still-restless military.
"There is an inclination toward a way out of any kind," said one official in the group. 
Other opposition leaders say a better option is a campaign of street protests to so debilitate Mr. Chavez that he would resign. 
"The strategy is to encircle Chavez to the point where he leaves, or he is tried on charges or he goes under some other scenario," said Carlos Hermoso, a leader in the Red Flag. 
To the president's ardent supporters, such plans are nothing short of treason and must be met with force.
"They insist on conspiring, in taking out President Chavez and establishing their own government," said Desiree Santos, a close ally in the National Assembly. "We would not permit a government without Chavez."

HEADLINE: Baseball Union, Still Talking, Sets a Strike Date of Aug. 30 

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Major league baseball, a sport plagued by labor showdowns, faces the prospect of its ninth work stoppage in 30 years after a decision by the players union yesterday to set a strike date of Aug. 30.
 The action by the union's executive board came four days after the players delayed setting a strike date, a move that created short-lived optimism that significant progress toward an agreement could be reached this week. 
 Instead, the sport faces its sixth players strike over the last three decades, to go along with three lockouts by management, in what amounts to one of the more contentious relationships in labor history.
"Setting a strike date is not something the players do lightly or cavalierly," Donald Fehr, the union's executive director, said. "We need a contract before the year is over and we feel this is likely the best way to do that." 
A major factor in the union's decision was its concern that, in the absence of a new agreement, the owners would put in place a new economic system after the World Series. That system, the players fear, would significantly depress salaries. As a result, the union feels it may have to strike, and maximize its leverage, before the season runs out.
If a strike does occur, it will be the first by the players since August 1994; in that instance, the work stoppage led to the cancellation of the World Series for the first time in 90 years and delayed the start of the 1995 season.
Yesterday's action by the union led to predictable dismay among fans. In Texas, President Bush, a former owner of the Texas Rangers, warned both the players and owners that he would be "furious" if there was a work stoppage.
On baseball's management front, there were negative reviews across the board.
Rob Manfred, the clubs' chief labor lawyer, called the decision disappointing. Andy MacPhail, the Chicago Cubs president, who is a member of management's negotiating committee, said it was regrettable. Management's tone, which had been moderate and conciliatory throughout the past six months of talks, took on a harsher tone.
But negotiators on both sides said they would continue meeting, and they scheduled a bargaining session for today.
The most serious obstacle they have to overcome is a luxury tax on payrolls, which the clubs call a competitive balance tax and one that is clearly designed to inhibit the spending of the big-market teams, led by the Yankees. The two sides are far apart on the rates for a luxury tax and the thresholds at which the tax would kick in. 
The clubs' proposal, for example, would cost the Yankees, over four years, $102 million more than the union plan.
"We believe it's time to get these spiraling payrolls under control," said Peter Angelos, the owner of the Baltimore Orioles and a member of the negotiating team.
The union has been opposed to any kind of tax on payrolls. "The purpose of a tax is to penalize someone, fine him, take his money away if he wants to hire somebody," Fehr said. "That's a pretty strange thing to do in 21st-century America."
The players and owners have yet to agree on other issues as well. They are divided on a plan for teams to share local revenue and reduce payroll disparity, but if the luxury tax divide can be bridged, the revenue-sharing issue will most likely be resolved.
The two sides also disagree on how to institute a worldwide draft of amateur players, but both sides have agreed that they will not let this issue stand in the way of a new bargaining agreement. If they agree on everything else, they will table the draft issue and resolve it later.
The union's board had delayed setting a strike date Monday after management officials said the move would undermine negotiations. But after three additional days of talks produced, in the union's view, disappointing results, the board acted during a conference call yesterday. All 57 players on the call said aye to Aug. 30.
The union selected that date because it is the start of Labor Day weekend, usually a lucrative series of dates for attendance, and it is the start of the final month of the regular season, in which many attractive matchups are scheduled, series that could affect the outcome of division and wild-card races.
The Los Angeles Dodgers and the Houston Astros, competing for the National League wild-card slot, play each other that weekend, as do the Arizona Diamondbacks, the N.L. West leader, and the San Francisco Giants, another wild-card contender trying to catch the Diamondbacks.
Series beginning on Labor Day pit the Yankees against the Boston Red Sox, who make up baseball's best rivalry; the Cincinnati Reds against the St. Louis Cardinals, who are battling in the N. L. Central division; and Los Angeles against Arizona. 
Later in the month, the American League West threesome of Seattle, Anaheim and Oakland -- now fighting for the division title and the wild-card spot -- are scheduled to play one another. Those games would most likely determine the postseason destiny of the three teams.
Of course, a strike date of Aug. 30 also poses a direct threat to the postseason, and, in particular, the World Series.
Members of the union's executive board expressed regret that they had to take the step of setting a strike date and said they hoped that negotiators could reach an agreement to forestall any work stoppage. But they also expressed concern about the past week's developments.
"What we thought was an attempt to stay positive and maintain a position to get a deal was mistaken by some as weakness," said Mike Remlinger, the Atlanta Braves' player representative. "We're hopeful that while the past three days weren't very productive as far as yield, we can move forward and ultimately get a deal done."
Remlinger said the union received "a lot of mixed signals the past few days." He added: "We're not sure what to make of them and how to take it all. That's one of the big things."
Tom Glavine, Remlinger's teammate and the National League player representative, said of management: "It seems they feel they have to provoke a fight with us to get what they want. As much as we didn't want to, we bit into the tax proposal -- certainly not what they want, but what they want you have to view as akin to a salary cap." 
Management officials scoffed at the idea that the luxury tax could act as a cap on payrolls, but the players firmly believe it could.
Aaron Boone of Cincinnati said the players had to face reality and be prepared "to do what we have to do." He added: "I'm also of the belief that if the owners legitimately want to negotiate and make a deal, there will be a deal. That remains to be seen."
Fehr said the players do not want to be where the National Basketball Association players were after the 1998 season, when they had no agreement and the league locked them out and instituted a signing freeze.
Despite the possibility of a strike, Denny Hocking of the Minnesota Twins adopted an optimistic view.
"I highly anticipate around the 27th, 28th or 29th the commissioner will say it's time to get a deal done," he said of Commissioner Bud Selig. "The deal will get done and everybody will praise him and he'll ride out on his white horse. That's the picture I have in my mind."

 EMPEROR OF JAPAN
Meiji and His World, 1852-1912.
By Donald Keene.
Illustrated. 922 pp. New York:
Columbia University Press. $39.50.
 TO understand contemporary Japan one first has to grasp the sweeping social changes of the last half of the 19th century. What appeared at the time to set them off was the arrival of Commodore Perry's American naval squadron in 1853. After many attempts by several Western powers to open up Japan to trade, Perry finally succeeded in ending centuries of Japan's self-imposed isolation. His success triggered a crisis of legitimacy. For more than six centuries the chief military leaders of Japan, the shoguns, had ruled the nation. Since 1603 the hereditary shoguns were members of the powerful Tokugawa family, who, while they claimed authority in the name of the emperors in Kyoto, in fact ran the government as they wanted, from their capital in Edo (Tokyo). The regime had become ossified through the years, and its inability to resist the Western incursion exposed its weakness. Eventually a civil war broke out, the feudal shogun system collapsed, and imperial rule was restored in 1868. 
In 1852, a year before Perry's arrival, a new crown prince, Mutsuhito, was born. No one could have foreseen the significance this child would assume as a symbol of Japan's modernization. As Donald Keene, with muted amusement, reveals in "Emperor of Japan," Mutsuhito's upbringing was sheltered from the turmoil overtaking his country; it was traditional, steeped in the ancient protocol and customs of the court. Yet by the time he ascended the throne at 15 he was the focus of national aspirations. Traditionally an emperor might have several names during his reign and a different one after death. This emperor was called Meiji (Enlightened Rule) from the beginning, and he, and the entire historical era he embodied, have been called Meiji ever since.
In practical terms the Meiji Restoration of 1868 did not bring about direct rule by the emperor. The new government was an oligarchy made up of the senior members of the loyalist faction that had overthrown the shogunate. Even though the loyalists gained support for their cause by promising to expel all foreigners, pragmatism quickly displaced impractical idealism. A total makeover of the government began promptly, on the model of a modern constitutional monarchy. As his first major act, the Meiji emperor promulgated the Charter Oath -- five promises to the people of Japan to bring fundamental change to the political system. Although the promises were general and vague, the Charter Oath became the foundational document that effectively set the government's course for the rest of the Meiji period (1868-1912).
In those 44 years the Meiji state instituted radical economic, military and legal reforms. With the tacit support of the emperor, the oligarchy ruthlessly swept aside old bureaucratic institutions and the feudal class structure. It set up new banking and educational systems, brought the legal code into line with Western standards and established a constitution in 1889 that created a parliamentary form of government. Perhaps most important, the Meiji oligarchy initiated a march to great-power status through policies that encouraged rapid industrialization at home and colonialist expansion abroad -- expansion that led Japan into war with China in 1894 and with Russia a decade later.
The decision to resist the power and hegemony of the West by consciously emulating Western cultural forms lies at the heart of all of these changes. Some members of the original oligarchy, among them Takamori Saigo, once commander of the imperial army, disagreed vehemently with this policy, and in the early years of the Meiji period the government experienced some resistance, most notably in what is known as the Satsuma Rebellion of 1877.
Once the young Meiji state had weathered its early crisis of legitimacy, however, it did not limit Japan's embrace of modernity to the importation of Western institutions and material culture. The oligarchy extended its mandate by beginning to build an empire in Asia. This mission demanded acquiescence in the racial ideologies that sustained colonial power, and only the construction of a myth of Japanese cultural uniqueness made this situation palatable. The result was a strange cultural synthesis, a hybrid of Western modernity and a newly created imperial ideology that promoted the concept of an essential Japanese culture rendered timeless by the unbroken succession of the royal line. The fundamental legacy of the Meiji period is thus the very idea of a modern Japanese state possessing a nationally shared cultural tradition. 
Given the eventful nature of his reign, the lack of English-language scholarship on this emperor's life is surprising. There are many fine books on aspects of the history and culture of the Meiji period; and in recent years distinguished studies by John Dower and Herbert Bix have explored the workings of the modern imperial system through an examination of the life of Meiji's grandson, Hirohito. The Meiji emperor, however, remains an aloof and enigmatic presence whose personal life is largely inaccessible even to most modern-day Japanese.
Donald Keene attempts to address this gap in the record -- to find Emperor Meiji," as he puts it. Few scholars are as well qualified to undertake this tremendous project. He began his scholarly career in Japanese studies a few years after World War II, and he continues to be one of the foremost critics and translators of Japanese culture. Although he is best known for his extensive writings on literature, he is a cultural historian with an encyclopedic knowledge of Japan. His special gifts are on display in "Emperor of Japan," which approaches Meiji's life by interweaving two separate but related narratives. Drawing on a wide range of sources, including the huge compilation, "Records of the Meiji Emperor" (Meiji tenno ki), Keene constructs a year-by-year biography of Meiji's life. A second narrative outlining the significant events of the Meiji period frames the daily details of the emperor's personal affairs. The result is a biography that serves as political history.
The appeal of this work lies in the skill with which these two narratives are tied together. Although Keene's interpretation of the period does not depart radically from standard histories, he constantly puts Meiji's life in a rich context, and his account is informed by a literary sensibility that lets us see major events in a new light. Keene maintains a critical balance between his role as a historian and his intimate engagement with his subject. His book is a history that revels in detail but remains accessible, leading us through the complex intricacies of court life, political intrigue and international affairs. 
It brings us as close to the inner life of the Meiji emperor as we are ever likely to get. Does it succeed in helping us to find Meiji? Yes and no. And the reservation here should remind us of how difficult it is even now for us to fit Hirohito into the history of World War II. There are personal reasons for what seems to be a mystery about the emperors, but cultural reasons as well. Keene's book gives a fuller picture of the man Meiji, but a sense of distance stubbornly remains. Perhaps this is due to the lack of direct commentary on his life by the emperor himself. There is a huge archive in Japan about him, but scant documentation that reveals how he regarded even the most crucial events of his time. Keene provides helpful speculations about Meiji's feelings and opinions at important moments; but, being a meticulous scholar, he also draws attention to the maddening gaps in the record.
In the end, he concludes that perhaps Meiji's greatest achievement was the longevity of his reign. But to put the stress on that brings the reader back to the problem that motivated this study in the first place. Meiji is remembered more as a representative figure of an era than as an individual because his personal identity largely derives from the symbolic nature of emperorship in Japan. For the better part of the millennium preceding Meiji's reign the primary functions of the emperor were ritual, or priestly. By the the middle of the 19th century the political ground of imperial legitimacy had become routinely symbolic -- a situation in which power flowed from the charisma of an institution rather than an individual. Meiji remains just beyond the biographer's grasp because his life was lived at that vanishing point where the public image of the emperor and the private life of the man become indistinguishable.

 BODY:
 (Editors' choices of other recent books of particular interest)

NEAR A THOUSAND TABLES: A History of Food, by Felipe Fernandez-Armesto. (Free Press, $25.) A bold historian (he has written a book about truth) undertakes to follow the shifts in history that have socialized people by making them cook and multiplied people by multiplying their diets and their choices.

VERSAILLES, by Kathryn Davis. (Houghton Mifflin, $21.) A reflective, mysterious novel about human development; it takes a soul's-eye view of the life of Marie Antoinette from her marriage at 14 to the guillotine at 38; narrated by herself sometime after her death, when she has had a chance to think some about her earthly life and its contents.

YOU ARE NOT A STRANGER HERE, by Adam Haslett. (Nan A. Talese/Doubleday, $21.95.) These nine short stories (Haslett's first collection) exhale a desiccated bleakness, a despair mitigated by the characters' continuing desire to be good, to do the right thing despite hopelessness, loss, disease and mental illness.

A THREAD ACROSS THE OCEAN: The Heroic Story of the Transatlantic Cable, by John Steele Gordon. (Walker, $26.) Laying a telegraphic cable 2,000 miles long and two miles deep required amazing supplies of money, time and nerve; it finally succeeded in 1866.

PRAGUE, by Arthur Phillips. (Random House, $24.95.) A first novel set in 1990, far beyond the recently fallen Berlin Wall, where young Americans reveal themselves not as travelers but mere tourists, detached from their surroundings, weightless and immaterial among time-battered buildings and people who have survived wars and uprisings.

HALF IN LOVE: Stories, by Maile Meloy. (Scribner, $23.) Fourteen stories, set mostly in the author's native Montana, among small-time racetracks and failed oil wells, where brides choose wedding dresses to hide branding-iron scars; no one expects an easy life here, and even the young feel their choices constrained by economics and losing habits.

THE GATEKEEPER: A Memoir, by Terry Eagleton. (St. Martin's, $19.95.) Charming, gregarious, remarkably acute autobiographical observations by a top practitioner of literary theory (at Cambridge, then Oxford, now Manchester) who was born into Britain's Irish Catholic working class but earned his present eminent position, very high and way over on the left.

CAMOUFLAGE: Stories, by Murray Bail. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $20.) Fourteen stories by an Australian who invests his space in satire, not character; in one story people hold races on the partitions of their office cubicles, while in another a conceptual artist offers to document the existence of everyone alive.

THE HEART OF REDNESS, by Zakes Mda. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $24.) A novel encompassing a black South African's critique of the cult of the new, presented as the combat between the forces of "progress" and those of tradition, all reflected from a defining religious schism in the Xhosa nation back in 1856-57.

HEADLINE: Globalization 

BYLINE:  By Tina Rosenberg; Tina Rosenberg writes editorials for The Times. Her last article for the magazine was about human rights in China.

 BODY:
Globalization is a phenomenon that has remade the economy of virtually every nation, reshaped almost every industry and touched billions of lives, often in surprising and ambiguous ways. The stories filling the front pages in recent weeks -- about economic crisis and contagion in Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil, about President Bush getting the trade bill he wanted -- are all part of the same story, the largest story of our times: what globalization has done, or has failed to do.
 Globalization is meant to signify integration and unity -- yet it has proved, in its way, to be no less polarizing than the cold-war divisions it has supplanted. The lines between globalization's supporters and its critics run not only between countries but also through them, as people struggle to come to terms with the defining economic force shaping the planet today. The two sides in the discussion -- a shouting match, really -- describe what seem to be two completely different forces. Is the globe being knit together by the Nikes and Microsofts and Citigroups in a dynamic new system that will eventually lift the have-nots of the world up from medieval misery? Or are ordinary people now victims of ruthless corporate domination, as the Nikes and Microsofts and Citigroups roll over the poor in nation after nation in search of new profits? 
 The debate over globalization's true nature has divided people in third-world countries since the phenomenon arose. It is now an issue in the United States as well, and many Americans -- those who neither make the deals inside World Trade Organization meetings nor man the barricades outside -- are perplexed. 
When I first set out to see for myself whether globalization has been for better or for worse, I was perplexed, too. I had sympathy for some of the issues raised by the protesters, especially their outrage over sweatshops. But I have also spent many years in Latin America, and I have seen firsthand how protected economies became corrupt systems that helped only those with clout. In general, I thought the protesters were simply being sentimental; after all, the masters of the universe must know what they are doing. But that was before I studied the agreements that regulate global trade -- including this month's new law granting President Bush a free hand to negotiate trade agreements, a document redolent of corporate lobbying. And it was before looking at globalization up close in Chile and Mexico, two nations that have embraced globalization especially ardently in the region of the third world that has done the most to follow the accepted rules. I no longer think the masters of the universe know what they are doing. 
The architects of globalization are right that international economic integration is not only good for the poor; it is essential. To embrace self-sufficiency or to deride growth, as some protesters do, is to glamorize poverty. No nation has ever developed over the long term without trade. East Asia is the most recent example. Since the mid-1970's, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, China and their neighbors have lifted 300 million people out of poverty, chiefly through trade. 
But the protesters are also right -- no nation has ever developed over the long term under the rules being imposed today on third-world countries by the institutions controlling globalization. The United States, Germany, France and Japan all became wealthy and powerful nations behind the barriers of protectionism. East Asia built its export industry by protecting its markets and banks from foreign competition and requiring investors to buy local products and build local know-how. These are all practices discouraged or made illegal by the rules of trade today. 
The World Trade Organization was designed as a meeting place where willing nations could sit in equality and negotiate rules of trade for their mutual advantage, in the service of sustainable international development. Instead, it has become an unbalanced institution largely controlled by the United States and the nations of Europe, and especially the agribusiness, pharmaceutical and financial-services industries in these countries. At W.T.O. meetings, important deals are hammered out in negotiations attended by the trade ministers of a couple dozen powerful nations, while those of poor countries wait in the bar outside for news.
The International Monetary Fund was created to prevent future Great Depressions in part by lending countries in recession money and pressing them to adopt expansionary policies, like deficit spending and low interest rates, so they would continue to buy their neighbors' products. Over time, its mission has evolved into the reverse: it has become a long-term manager of the economies of developing countries, blindly committed to the bitter medicine of contraction no matter what the illness. Its formation was an acknowledgment that markets sometimes work imperfectly, but it has become a champion of market supremacy in all situations, echoing the voice of Wall Street and the United States Treasury Department, more interested in getting wealthy creditors repaid than in serving the poor. 
It is often said that globalization is a force of nature, as unstoppable and difficult to contain as a storm. This is untrue and misleading. Globalization is a powerful phenomenon -- but it is not irreversible, and indeed the previous wave of globalization, at the turn of the last century, was stopped dead by World War I. Today it would be more likely for globalization to be sabotaged by its own inequities, as disillusioned nations withdraw from a system they see as indifferent or harmful to the poor. 
Globalization's supporters portray it as the peeling away of distortions to reveal a clean and elegant system of international commerce, the one nature intended. It is anything but. The accord creating the W.T.O. is 22,500 pages long -- not exactly a free trade agreement. All globalization, it seems, is local, the rules drawn up by, and written to benefit, powerful nations and powerful interests within those nations. Globalization has been good for the United States, but even in this country, the gains go disproportionately to the wealthy and to big business. 
It's not too late for globalization to work. But the system is in need of serious reform. More equitable rules would spread its benefits to the ordinary citizens of wealthy countries. They would also help to preserve globalization by giving the poor of the world a stake in the system -- and, not incidentally, improve the lives of hundreds of millions of people. Here, then, are nine new rules for the global economy -- a prescription to save globalization from itself.
If there is any place in Latin America where the poor have thrived because of globalization, it is Chile. Between 1987 and 1998, Chile cut poverty by more than half. Its success shows that poor nations can take advantage of globalization -- if they have governments that actively make it happen. 
Chile reduced poverty by growing its economy -- 6.6 percent a year from 1985 to 2000. One of the few points economists can agree on is that growth is the most important thing a nation can do for its poor. They can't agree on basics like whether poverty in the world is up or down in the last 15 years -- the number of people who live on less than $1 a day is slightly down, but the number who live on less than $2 is slightly up. Inequality has soared during the last 15 years, but economists cannot agree on whether globalization is mainly at fault or whether other forces, like the uneven spread of technology, are responsible. They can't agree on how to reduce inequality -- growth tends not to change it. They can't agree on whether the poor who have not been helped are victims of globalization or have simply not yet enjoyed access to its benefits -- in other words, whether the solution is more globalization or less. But economists agree on one thing: to help the poor, you'd better grow. 
For the rest of Latin America, and most of the developing world except China (and to a lesser extent India), globalization as practiced today is failing, and it is failing because it has not produced growth. Excluding China, the growth rate of poor countries was 2 percent a year lower in the 1990's than in the 1970's, when closed economies were the norm and the world was in a recession brought on in part by oil-price shocks. Latin American economies in the 1990's grew at an average annual rate of 2.9 percent -- about half the rate of the 1960's. By the end of the 1990's, 11 million more Latin Americans lived in poverty than at the beginning of the decade. And in country after country, Latin America's poor are suffering -- either from economic crises and market panics or from the day-to-day deprivations that globalization was supposed to relieve. The surprise is not that Latin Americans are once again voting for populist candidates but that the revolt against globalization took so long.
When I visited Eastern Europe after the end of Communism, a time when democracy was mainly bringing poverty, I heard over and over again that the reason for Chile's success was Augusto Pinochet. Only a dictator with a strong hand can put his country through the pain of economic reform, went the popular wisdom. In truth, we now know that inflicting pain is the easy part; governments democratic and dictatorial are all instituting free-market austerity. The point is not to inflict pain but to lessen it. In this Pinochet failed, and the democratic governments that followed him beginning in 1990 have succeeded . 
What Pinochet did was to shut down sectors of Chile's economy that produced goods for the domestic market, like subsistence farming and appliance manufacturing, and point the economy toward exports. Here he was following the standard advice that economists give developing countries -- but there are different ways to do it, and Pinochet's were disastrous. Instead of helping the losers, he dismantled the social safety net and much of the regulatory apparatus that might have kept privatization honest. When the world economy went into recession in 1982, Chile's integration into the global marketplace and its dependence on foreign capital magnified the crash. Poverty soared, and unemployment reached 20 percent. 
Pinochet's second wave of globalization, in the late 1980's, worked better, because the state did not stand on the side. It regulated the changes effectively and aggressively promoted exports. But Pinochet created a time bomb in Chile: the country's exports were, and still are, nonrenewable natural resources. Chile began subsidizing companies that cut down native forests for wood chips, for example, and the industry is rapidly deforesting the nation. 
Chile began to grow, but inequality soared -- the other problem with Pinochet's globalization was that it left out the poor. While the democratic governments that succeeded Pinochet have not yet been able to reduce inequality, at least it is no longer increasing, and they have been able to use the fruits of Chile's growth to help the poor. 
Chile's democratic governments have spread the benefits of economic integration by designing effective social programs and aiming them at the poor. Chile has sunk money into revitalizing the 900 worst primary schools. It now leads Latin America in computers in schools, along with Costa Rica. It provides the very low-income with housing subsidies, child care and income support. Open economy or closed, these are good things. But Chile's government is also taking action to mitigate one of the most dangerous aspects of global integration: the violent ups and downs that come from linking your economy to the rest of the world. This year it created unemployment insurance. And it was the first nation to institute what is essentially a tax on short-term capital, to discourage the kind of investment that can flood out during a market panic. 
The conventional wisdom among economists today is that successful globalizers must be like Chile. This was not always the thinking. In the 1980's, the Washington Consensus -- the master-of-the-universe ideology at the time, highly influenced by the Reagan and Thatcher administrations -- held that government was in the way. Globalizers' tasks included privatization, deregulation, fiscal austerity and financial liberalization. "In the 1980's and up to 1996 or 1997, the state was considered the devil," says Juan Martin, an Argentine economist at the United Nations' Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean. "Now we know you need infrastructure, institutions, education. In fact, when the economy opens, you need more control mechanisms from the state, not fewer."
And what if you don't have these things? Bolivia carried out extensive reforms beginning in 1985 -- a year in which it had inflation of 23,000 percent -- to make the economy more stable and efficient. But in the words of the World Bank, "It is a good example of a country that has achieved successful stabilization and implemented innovative market reforms, yet made only limited progress in the fight against poverty." Latin America is full of nations that cannot make globalization work. The saddest example is Haiti, an excellent student of the rules of globalization, ranked at the top of the I.M.F.'s index of trade openness. Yet over the 1990's, Haiti's economy contracted; annual per capita income is now $250. No surprise -- if you are a corrupt and misgoverned nation with a closed economy, becoming a corrupt and misgoverned nation with an open economy is not going to solve your problems.
If there is a showcase for globalization in Latin America, it lies on the outskirts of Puebla, Mexico, at Volkswagen Mexico. Every New Beetle in the world is made here, 440 a day, in a factory so sparkling and clean that you could have a baby on the floor, so high-tech that in some halls it is not evident that human beings work here. Volkswagen Mexico also makes Jettas and, in a special hall, 80 classic Beetles a day to sell in Mexico, one of the last places in the world where the old Bug still chugs. 
The Volkswagen factory is the biggest single industrial plant in Mexico. Humans do work here -- 11,000 people in assembly-line jobs, 4,000 more in the rest of the factory -- with 11,000 more jobs in the industrial park of VW suppliers across the street making parts, seats, dashboards and other components. Perhaps 50,000 more people work in other companies around Mexico that supply VW. The average monthly wage in the plant is $760, among the highest in the country's industrial sector. The factory is the equal of any in Germany, the product of a billion-dollar investment in 1995, when VW chose Puebla as the exclusive site for the New Beetle. 
Ahhh, globalization. 
Except . . . this plant is not here because Mexico has an open economy, but because it had a closed one. In 1962, Mexico decreed that any automaker that wanted to sell cars here had to produce them here. Five years later, VW opened the factory. Mexico's local content requirement is now illegal, except for very limited exceptions, under W.T.O. rules; in Mexico the local content requirement for automobiles is being phased out and will disappear entirely in January 2004.
The Puebla factory, for all the jobs and foreign exchange it brings Mexico, also refutes the argument that foreign technology automatically rubs off on the local host. Despite 40 years here, the auto industry has not created much local business or know-how. VW makes the point that it buys 60 percent of its parts in Mexico, but the "local" suppliers are virtually all foreign-owned and import most of the materials they use. The value Mexico adds to the Beetles it exports is mainly labor. Technology transfer -- the transmission of know-how from foreign companies to local ones -- is limited in part because most foreign trade today is intracompany; Ford Hermosillo, for example, is a stamping and assembly plant shipping exclusively to Ford plants in the United States. Trade like this is particularly impenetrable to outsiders. "In spite of the fact that Mexico has been host to many car plants, we don't know how to build a car," says Huberto Juarez, an economist at the Autonomous University of Puebla. 
Volkswagen Mexico is the epitome of the strategy Mexico has chosen for globalization -- assembly of imported parts. It is a strategy that makes perfect sense given Mexico's proximity to the world's largest market, and it has given rise to the maquila industry, which uses Mexican labor to assemble foreign parts and then re-export the finished products. Although the economic slowdown in the United States is hurting the maquila industry, it still employs a million people and brings the country $10 billion a year in foreign exchange. The factories have turned Mexico into one of the developing world's biggest exporters of medium- and high-technology products. But the maquila sector remains an island and has failed to stimulate Mexican industries -- one reason Mexico's globalization has brought disappointing growth, averaging only 3 percent a year during the 1990's.
In countries as varied as South Korea, China and Mauritius, however, assembly work has been the crucible of wider development. Jeffrey Sachs, the development economist who now directs Columbia University's Earth Institute, says that the maquila industry is "magnificent." "I could cite 10 success stories," he says, "and every one started with a maquila sector." When Korea opened its export-processing zone in Masan in the early 1970's, local inputs were 3 percent of the export value, according to the British development group Oxfam. Ten years later they were almost 50 percent. General Motors took a Korean textile company called Daewoo and helped shape it into a conglomerate making cars, electronic goods, ships and dozens of other products. Daewoo calls itself "a locomotive for national economic development since its founding in 1967." And despite the company's recent troubles, it's true -- because Korea made it true. G.M. did not tutor Daewoo because it welcomed competition but because Korea demanded it. Korea wanted to build high-tech industry, and it did so by requiring technology transfer and by closing markets to imports. 
Maquilas first appeared in Mexico in 1966. Although the country has gone from assembling clothing to assembling high-tech goods, nearly 40 years later 97 percent of the components used in Mexican maquilas are still imported, and the value that Mexico adds to its exports has actually declined sharply since the mid-1970's. 
Mexico has never required companies to transfer technology to locals, and indeed, under the rules of the North American Free Trade Agreement, it cannot. "We should have included a technical component in Nafta," says Luis de la Calle, one of the treaty's negotiators and later Mexico's under secretary of economy for foreign trade. "We should be getting a significant transfer of technology from the United States, and we didn't really try." 
Without technology transfer, maquila work is marked for extinction. As transport costs become less important, Mexico is increasingly competing with China and Bangladesh -- where labor goes for as little as 9 cents an hour. This is one reason that real wages for the lowest-paid workers in Mexico dropped by 50 percent from 1985 to 2000. Businesses, in fact, are already leaving to go to China. 
When Americans think about globalization, they often think about sweatshops -- one aspect of globalization that ordinary people believe they can influence through their buying choices. In many of the factories in Mexico, Central America and Asia producing American-brand toys, clothes, sneakers and other goods, exploitation is the norm. The young women who work in them -- almost all sweatshop workers are young women -- endure starvation wages, forced overtime and dangerous working conditions. 
In Chile, I met a man who works at a chicken-processing plant in a small town. The plant is owned by Chileans and processes chicken for the domestic market and for export to Europe, Asia and other countries in Latin America. His job is to stand in a freezing room and crack open chickens as they come down an assembly line at the rate of 41 per minute. When visitors arrive at the factory (the owners did not return my phone calls requesting a visit or an interview), the workers get a respite, as the line slows down to half-speed for show. His work uniform does not protect him from the cold, the man said, and after a few minutes of work he loses feeling in his hands. Some of his colleagues, he said, are no longer able to raise their arms. If he misses a day he is docked $30. He earns less than $200 a month.
Is this man a victim of globalization? The protesters say that he is, and at one point I would have said so, too. He -- and all workers -- should have dignified conditions and the right to organize. All companies should follow local labor laws, and activists should pressure companies to pay their workers decent wages. 
But today if I were to picket globalization, I would protest other inequities. In a way, the chicken worker, who came to the factory when driving a taxi ceased to be profitable, is a beneficiary of globalization. So are the millions of young women who have left rural villages to be exploited gluing tennis shoes or assembling computer keyboards. The losers are those who get laid off when companies move to low-wage countries, or those forced off their land when imports undercut their crop prices, or those who can no longer afford life-saving medicine -- people whose choices in life diminish because of global trade. Globalization has offered this man a hellish job, but it is a choice he did not have before, and he took it; I don't name him because he is afraid of being fired. When this chicken company is hiring, the lines go around the block. 
The argument that open economies help the poor rests to a large extent on the evidence that closed economies do not. While South Korea and other East Asian countries successfully used trade barriers to create export industries, this is rare; most protected economies are disasters. "The main tendency in a sheltered market is to goof off," says Jagdish Bhagwati, a prominent free-trader who is the Arthur Lehman professor of economics at Columbia University. "A crutch becomes a permanent crutch. Infant-industry protection should be for infant industries." 
Anyone who has lived or traveled in the third world can attest that while controlled economies theoretically allow governments to help the poor, in practice it's usually a different story. In Latin America, spending on social programs largely goes to the urban middle class. Attention goes to people who can organize, strike, lobby and contribute money. And in a closed economy, the "state" car factory is often owned by the dictator's son and the country's forests can be chopped down by his golf partner. 
Free trade, its proponents argue, takes these decisions away from the government and leaves them to the market, which punishes corruption. And it's true that a system that took corruption and undue political influence out of economic decision-making could indeed benefit the poor. But humans have not yet invented such a system -- and if they did, it would certainly not be the current system of globalization, which is soiled with the footprints of special interests. In every country that negotiates at the W.T.O. or cuts a free-trade deal, trade ministers fall under heavy pressure from powerful business groups. Lobbyists have learned that they can often quietly slip provisions that pay big dividends into complex trade deals. None have been more successful at getting what they want than those from America.
The most egregious example of a special-interest provision is the W.T.O.'s rules on intellectual property. The ability of poor nations to make or import cheap copies of drugs still under patent in rich countries has been a boon to world public health. But the W.T.O. will require most of its poor members to accept patents on medicine by 2005, with the very poorest nations following in 2016. This regime does nothing for the poor. Medicine prices will probably double, but poor countries will never offer enough of a market to persuade the pharmaceutical industry to invent cures for their diseases. 
The intellectual-property rules have won worldwide notoriety for the obstacles they pose to cheap AIDS medicine. They are also the provision of the W.T.O. that economists respect the least. They were rammed into the W.T.O. by Washington in response to the industry groups who control United States trade policy on the subject. "This is not a trade issue," Bhagwati says. "It's a royalty-collection issue. It's pharmaceuticals and software throwing their weight around." The World Bank calculated that the intellectual-property rules will result in a transfer of $40 billion a year from poor countries to corporations in the developed world. 
Manuel de Jesus Gomez is a corn farmer in the hills of Puebla State, 72 years old and less than five feet tall. I met him in his field of six acres, where he was trudging behind a plow pulled by a burro. He farms the same way campesinos in these hills have been farming for thousands of years. In Puebla, and in the poverty belt of Mexico's southern states -- Chiapas, Oaxaca, Guerrero -- corn growers plow with animals and irrigate by praying for rain.
Before Nafta, corn covered 60 percent of Mexico's cultivated land. This is where corn was born, and it remains a symbol of the nation and daily bread for most Mexicans. But in the Nafta negotiations, Mexico agreed to open itself to subsidized American corn, a policy that has crushed small corn farmers. "Before, we could make a living, but now sometimes what we sell our corn for doesn't even cover our costs," Gomez says. With Nafta, he suddenly had to compete with American corn -- raised with the most modern methods, but more important, subsidized to sell overseas at 20 percent less than the cost of production. Subsidized American corn now makes up almost half of the world's stock, effectively setting the world price so low that local small farmers can no longer survive. This competition helped cut the price paid to Gomez for his corn by half.
Because of corn's importance to Mexico, when it negotiated Nafta it was promised 15 years to gradually raise the amount of corn that could enter the country without tariffs. But Mexico voluntarily lifted the quotas in less than three years -- to help the chicken and pork industry, Mexican negotiators told me unabashedly. (Eduardo Bours, a member of the family that owns Mexico's largest chicken processor, was one of Mexico's Nafta negotiators.) The state lost some $2 billion in tariffs it could have charged, and farmers were instantly exposed to competition from the north. According to ANEC, a national association of campesino cooperatives, half a million corn farmers have left their land and moved to Mexican cities or to America. If it were not for a weak peso, which keeps the price of imports relatively high, far more farmers would be forced off their land. 
The toll on small farmers is particularly bitter because cheaper corn has not translated into cheaper food for Mexicans. As part of its economic reforms, Mexico has gradually removed price controls on tortillas and tortilla flour. Tortilla prices have nearly tripled in real terms even as the price of corn has dropped. 
Is this how it was supposed to be? I asked Andres Rosenzweig, a longtime Mexican agriculture official who helped negotiate the agricultural sections of Nafta. He was silent for a minute. "The problems of rural poverty in Mexico did not start with Nafta," he said. "The size of our farms is not viable, and they get smaller each generation because farmers have many children, who divide the land. A family in Puebla with five hectares could raise 10, maybe 15, tons of corn each year. That was an annual income of 16,000 pesos," the equivalent of $1,600 today. "Double it and you still die of hunger. This has nothing to do with Nafta. 
"The solution for small corn farmers," he went on, "is to educate their children and find them jobs outside agriculture. But Mexico was not growing, not generating jobs. Who's going to employ them? Nafta." 
One prominent antiglobalization report keeps referring to farms like Gomez's as "small-scale, diversified, self-reliant, community-based agriculture systems." You could call them that, I guess; you could also use words like "malnourished," "undereducated" and "miserable" to describe their inhabitants. Rosenzweig is right -- this is not a life to be romanticized. 
But to turn the farm families' malnutrition into starvation makes no sense. Mexico spends foreign exchange to buy corn. Instead, it could be spending money to bring farmers irrigation, technical help and credit. A system in which the government purchased farmers' corn at a guaranteed price -- done away with in states like Puebla during the free-market reforms of the mid-1990's -- has now been replaced by direct payments to farmers. The program is focused on the poor, but the payments are symbolic -- $36 an acre. In addition, rural credit has disappeared, as the government has effectively shut down the rural bank, which was badly run, and other banks won't lend to small farmers. There is a program -- understaffed and poorly publicized -- to help small producers, but the farmers I met didn't know about it. 
Free trade is a religion, and with religion comes hypocrisy. Rich nations press other countries to open their agricultural markets. At the urging of the I.M.F. and Washington, Haiti slashed its tariffs on rice in 1995. Prices paid to rice farmers fell by 25 percent, which has devastated Haiti's rural poor. In China, the tariff demands of W.T.O. membership will cost tens of millions of peasants their livelihoods. But European farmers get 35 percent of their income from government subsidies, and American farmers get 20 percent. Farm subsidies in the United States, moreover, are a huge corporate-welfare program, with nearly 70 percent of payments going to the largest 10 percent of producers. Subsidies also depress crop prices abroad by encouraging overproduction. The farm bill President Bush signed in May -- with substantial Democratic support -- provides about $57 billion in subsidies for American corn and other commodities over the next 10 years.
Wealthy nations justify pressure on small countries to open markets by arguing that these countries cannot grow rice and corn efficiently -- that American crops are cheap food for the world's hungry. But with subsidies this large, it takes chutzpah to question other nations' efficiency. And in fact, the poor suffer when America is the supermarket to the world, even at bargain prices. There is plenty of food in the world, and even many countries with severe malnutrition are food exporters. The problem is that poor people can't afford it. The poor are the small farmers. Three-quarters of the world's poor are rural. If they are forced off their land by subsidized grain imports, they starve. 
Back in the 1950's, Latin American economists made a simple calculation. The products their nations exported -- copper, tin, coffee, rice and other commodities -- were buying less and less of the high-value-added goods they wanted to import. In effect, they were getting poorer each day. Their solution was to close their markets and develop domestic industries to produce their own appliances and other goods for their citizens. 
The strategy, which became known as import substitution, produced high growth -- for a while. But these closed economies ultimately proved unsustainable. Latin American governments made their consumers buy inferior and expensive products -- remember the Brazilian computer of the 1970's? Growth depended on heavy borrowing and high deficits. When they could no longer roll over their debts, Latin American economies crashed, and a decade of stagnation resulted. 
At the time, the architects of import substitution could not imagine that it was possible to export anything but commodities. But East Asia -- as poor or poorer than Latin America in the 1960's -- showed in the 1980's and 1990's that it can be done. Unfortunately, the rules of global trade now prohibit countries from using the strategies successfully employed to develop export industries in East Asia. 
American trade officials argue that they are not using tariffs to block poor countries from exporting, and they are right -- the average tariff charged by the United States is a negligible 1.7 percent, much lower than other nations. But the rules rich nations have set -- on technology transfer, local content and government aid to their infant industries, among other things -- are destroying poor nations' abilities to move beyond commodities. "We are pulling up the ladder on policies the developed countries used to become rich," says Lori Wallach, the director of Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch. 
The commodities that poor countries are left to export are even more of a dead end today than in the 1950's. Because of oversupply, prices for coffee, cocoa, rice, sugar and tin dropped by more than 60 percent between 1980 and 2000. Because of the price collapse of commodities and sub-Saharan Africa's failure to move beyond them, the region's share of world trade dropped by two-thirds during that time. If it had the same share of exports today that it had at the start of the 1980's, per capita income in sub-Saharan Africa would be almost twice as high.
Probably the single most important change for the developing world would be to legalize the export of the one thing they have in abundance -- people. Earlier waves of globalization were kinder to the poor because not only capital, but also labor, was free to move. Dani Rodrik, an economist at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government and a leading academic critic of the rules of globalization, argues for a scheme of legal short-term migration. If rich nations opened 3 percent of their work forces to temporary migrants, who then had to return home, Rodrik says, it would generate $200 billion annually in wages, and a lot of technology transfer for poor countries. 
Globalization means risk. By opening its economy, a nation makes itself vulnerable to contagion from abroad. Countries that have liberalized their capital markets are especially susceptible, as short-term capital that has whooshed into a country on investor whim whooshes out just as fast when investors panic. This is how a real-estate crisis in Thailand in 1997 touched off one of the biggest global conflagrations since the Depression. 
The desire to keep money from rushing out inspired Chile to install speed bumps discouraging short-term capital inflows. But Chile's policy runs counter to the standard advice of the I.M.F., which has required many countries to open their capital markets. "There were so many obstacles to capital-market integration that it was hard to err on the side of pushing countries to liberalize too much," says Ken Rogoff, the I.M.F.'s director of research. 
Prudent nations are wary of capital liberalization, and rightly so. Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel Prize-winning economist who has become the most influential critic of globalization's rules, writes that in December 1997, when he was chief economist at the World Bank, he met with South Korean officials who were balking at the I.M.F.'s advice to open their capital markets. They were scared of the hot money, but they could not disagree with the I.M.F., lest they be seen as irresponsible. If the I.M.F. expressed disapproval, it would drive away other donors and private investors as well. 
In the wake of the Asian collapse, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad imposed capital controls in Malaysia -- to worldwide condemnation. But his policy is now widely considered to be the reason that Malaysia stayed stable while its neighbors did not. "It turned out to be a brilliant decision," Bhagwati says.
Post-crash, the I.M.F. prescribed its standard advice for nations -- making loan arrangements contingent on spending cuts, interest-rate hikes and other contractionary measures. But balancing a budget in recession is, as Stiglitz puts it in his new book, "Globalization and Its Discontents," a recommendation last taken seriously in the days of Herbert Hoover. The I.M.F.'s recommendations deepened the crisis and forced governments to reduce much of the cushion that was left for the poor. Indonesia had to cut subsidies on food. "While the I.M.F. had provided some $23 billion to be used to support the exchange rate and bail out creditors," Stiglitz writes, "the far, far, smaller sums required to help the poor were not forthcoming." 
Is your international financial infrastructure breeding Bolsheviks? If it does create a backlash, one reason is the standard Bolshevik explanation -- the I.M.F. really is controlled by the epicenter of international capital. Formal influence in the I.M.F. depends on a nation's financial contribution, and America is the only country with enough shares to have a veto. It is striking how many economists think the I.M.F. is part of the "Wall Street-Treasury complex," in the words of Bhagwati. The fund serves "the interests of global finance," Stiglitz says. It listens to the "voice of the markets," says Nancy Birdsall, president of the Center for Global Development in Washington and a former executive vice president of the Inter-American Development Bank. "The I.M.F. is a front for the U.S. government -- keep the masses away from our taxpayers," Sachs says. 
I.M.F. officials argue that their advice is completely equitable -- they tell even wealthy countries to open their markets and contract their economies. In fact, Stiglitz writes, the I.M.F. told the Clinton administration to hike interest rates to lower the danger of inflation -- at a time when inflation was the lowest it had been in decades. But the White House fortunately had the luxury of ignoring the I.M.F.: Washington will only have to take the organization's advice the next time it turns to the I.M.F. for a loan. And that will be never. 
The idea that free trade maximizes benefits for all is one of the few tenets economists agree on. But the power of the idea has led to the overly credulous acceptance of much of what is put forward in its name. Stiglitz writes that there is simply no support for many I.M.F. policies, and in some cases the I.M.F. has ignored clear evidence that what it advocated was harmful. You can always argue -- and American and I.M.F. officials do -- that countries that follow the I.M.F.'s line but still fail to grow either didn't follow the openness recipe precisely enough or didn't check off other items on the to-do list, like expanding education. 
Policy makers also seem to be skipping the fine print on supposedly congenial studies. An influential recent paper by the World Bank economists David Dollar and Aart Kraay is a case in point. It finds a strong correlation between globalization and growth and is widely cited to support the standard rules of openness. But in fact, on close reading, it does not support them. Among successful "globalizers," Dollar and Kraay count countries like China, India and Malaysia, all of whom are trading and growing but still have protected economies and could not be doing more to misbehave by the received wisdom of globalization. 
Dani Rodrik of Harvard used Dollar and Kraay's data to look at whether the single-best measure of openness -- a country's tariff levels -- correlates with growth. They do, he found -- but not the way they are supposed to. High-tariff countries grew faster. Rodrik argues that the countries in the study may have begun to trade more because they had grown and gotten richer, not the other way around. China and India, he points out, began trade reforms about 10 years after they began high growth. 
When economists talk about many of the policies associated with free trade today, they are talking about national averages and ignoring questions of distribution and inequality. They are talking about equations, not what works in messy third-world economies. What economic model taught in school takes into account a government ministry that stops work because it has run out of pens? The I.M.F. and the World Bank -- which recommends many of the same austerity measures as the I.M.F. and frequently conditions its loans on I.M.F.-advocated reforms -- often tell countries to cut subsidies, including many that do help the poor, and impose user fees on services like water. The argument is that subsidies are an inefficient way to help poor people -- because they help rich people too -- and instead, countries should aid the poor directly with vouchers or social programs. As an equation, it adds up. But in the real world, the subsidies disappear, and the vouchers never materialize.
The I.M.F. argues that it often saves countries from even more budget cuts. "Countries come to us when they are in severe distress and no one will lend to them," Rogoff says. "They may even have to run surpluses because their loans are being called in. Being in an I.M.F. program means less austerity." But a third of the developing world is under I.M.F. tutelage, some countries for decades, during which they must remodel their economies according to the standard I.M.F. blueprint. In March 2000, a panel appointed to advise Congress on international financial institutions, named for its head, Allan Meltzer of Carnegie Mellon University, recommended unanimously that the I.M.F. should undertake only short-term crisis assistance and get out of the business of long-term economic micromanagement altogether.
The standard reforms deprive countries of flexibility, the power to get rich the way we know can work. "Most Latin American countries have had deep reforms, have gone much further than India or China and haven't gotten much return for their effort," Birdsall says. "Many of the reforms were about creating an efficient economy, but the economic technicalities are not addressing the fundamental question of why countries are not growing, or the constraint that all these people are being left out. Economists are way too allergic to the wishy-washy concept of fairness." 
The protesters in the street, the Asian financial crisis, criticism from respected economists like Stiglitz and Rodrik and those on the Meltzer Commission and particularly the growing realization in the circles of power that globalization is sustainable for wealthy nations only if it is acceptable to the poor ones are all combining to change the rules -- slightly. The debt-forgiveness initiative for the poorest nations, for all its limitations, is one example. The Asian crisis has modified the I.M.F.'s view on capital markets, and it is beginning to apply less pressure on countries in crisis to cut government spending. It is also debating whether it should be encouraging countries to adopt Chile's speed bumps. The incoming director of the W.T.O. is from Thailand, and third-world countries are beginning to assert themselves more and more. 
But the changes do not alter the underlying idea of globalization, that openness is the universal prescription for all ills. "Belt-tightening is not a development strategy," Sachs says. "The I.M.F. has no sense that its job is to help countries climb a ladder."
Sachs says that for many developing nations, even climbing the ladder is unrealistic. "It can't work in an AIDS pandemic or an endemic malaria zone. I don't have a strategy for a significant number of countries, other than we ought to help them stay alive and control disease and have clean water. You can't do this purely on market forces. The prospects for the Central African Republic are not the same as for Shanghai, and it doesn't do any good to give pep talks." 
China, Chile and other nations show that under the right conditions, globalization can lift the poor out of misery. Hundreds of millions of poor people will never be helped by globalization, but hundreds of millions more could be benefiting now, if the rules had not been rigged to help the rich and follow abstract orthodoxies. Globalization can begin to work for the vast majority of the world's population only if it ceases to be viewed as an end in itself, and instead is treated as a tool in service of development: a way to provide food, health, housing and education to the wretched of the earth.

HEADLINE: The Silk Route 

BYLINE:  By Joyce Chang; Joyce Chang is a contributor to The New York Times Magazine.

 BODY:
My mother's qipao was made of red silk that shone like a ribbon, soft to the touch, heavy in my arms. It fit every curve of her tiny frame; it made a woman out of her. She had worn it on her wedding night. As a little girl, I used to play dress-up in it. By the time I was 12, raised on milk and cheeseburgers in America, I had outgrown it.
My mother promised that one day she would take me to China to have my own qipao made. The qipao (pronounced CHEE-pow in Mandarin and known as a cheongsam in Cantonese) is a body-skimming robe with a high Mandarin collar and distinctive flap across the front combined with a form-fitting European-style dress. It was immortalized, for better or for worse, in "The World of Suzie Wong," the 1960 film about a sweet prostitute in love with an American. 
 The Chang family vacation, summer 2002. We set off for Hong Kong. Neither of my parents had ever visited China. My father had come to the States from Sichuan as a baby in his mother's arms and had never learned a word of Chinese. My mother, from Taiwan, had traveled halfway around the world to become a surgeon and had never looked back. I wanted to travel halfway around the world for a new dress. 
 Full of millionaires, skyscrapers carved out of the tropical hillsides and bridges that look like spider webs spun among its islands, Hong Kong has a considerable history that is dwarfed only by its future. It is a city that has always been rich, and keeps getting richer. Just an hour's ride and an immigration checkpoint away is a city called Shenzhen. A footbridge leads to it from the Hong Kong side across a rancid body of water. You smell Shenzhen before you arrive. In 1980, the government designated it as one of four special economic zones controlled more by investment interests than the party line. By 1990, this former small agricultural town had increased its gross national product by a factor of 49. By 1992, it had increased 102 times over the 1980 figure. It is known as Instant China, a city that exploded overnight, China's Wild West, where wealthy Hong Kong businessmen buy condos for their mistresses.
It is also where the ladies of Hong Kong get clothes made cheaply. They bring their favorite Prada suits to be copied at a fraction of the original cost. And they have qipao made.
An American friend had suggested that her cousin, Rulin, act as my guide to Shenzhen. By the time we made our arrangements, I had only an hour and a half to shop for fabric in Hong Kong. My mother and I raced through a rain-soaked city (monsoon season -- whoops!) in search of silk. Despite the rain, the streets were full. Narrow cobblestone side streets were lined with stalls that sold everything from fresh fish to bras to fabric. Older women hawked their wares in loud Cantonese. We didn't find my fabric until, several stops later, we arrived at Blanc de Chine, importers of material from all over the world. Some of the fabrics, worth thousands of dollars a meter, are kept under lock and key.
My mother picked a pretty enough blue-and-white print -- one not kept under lock and key. When I told the clerk I was taking the fabric to Shenzhen, she cried out, "Ai ya!"
There were tailors at Blanc de Chine. They were good enough for Michelle Yeoh, who had her qipao made there for the Academy Awards the year that "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" won for best foreign-language film.
"Sorry," I said. It was too late. We were bound for Shenzhen.
I raced to meet Rulin at our hotel. She whizzed into the driveway in a convertible. Unfortunately, because of visa problems that we would resolve in a few days, my mother could not make this trip.
"Thank you so much for taking time to do this," I told Rulin.
"Don't worry -- you've given me an excuse to go to Shenzhen," she said, the way Chinese people do: any favor is no trouble, any stop is on the way.
When Rulin and her friends go to Shenzhen, it's a girls' day out. They bring cash and have drivers take them. A new luxury Shangri-La hotel has opened; golf courses have sprung up. Shenzhen is a city, like much of China, dominated by bamboo scaffolding announcing even more construction. But Rulin and her girlfriends have just one destination -- the Lo Wu Commercial City, a five-story mall. They shop, eat lunch, get manicures and have their hair done. For 35 Hong Kong dollars (less than $5 in American money), they get foot massages by people who travel two hours a day each way from their homes in the outskirts to rub feet in the big city.
Crowded, confusing, harshly lit, the Commercial City is known for its excellent fakes. Some Hong Kong connoisseurs of fake handbags insist that Shenzhen's bags are better designed than the originals. Legend has it that designers from a famous Paris house brought a Shenzhen fake back to Paris to study it.
Because of the crackdown on piracy by the government, the merchandise in the stores is limited. But customers can select looks from catalogs, and runners fetch them from off-site locations. Some vendors keep their stash in false ceilings. The clerks called out as we passed, begging us to come back.
Rulin wanted to take me to a special tailor. But in the maze of the mall, amid the fake Vuittons, Pradas and Nikes, we never found her. Instead, there was Mrs. Shing, another person Rulin knew.
Tacky qipao in garish colors and high gloss fabrics lined the walls of her cramped shop. Mrs. Shing's brother-in-law sat in the back, laboring at the sewing machine. He was altering a jacket, his pinkie finger with its long, pointed nail raised as if he were drinking a cup of English tea.
"Don't be afraid," Rulin said, reading my mind. "You tell her exactly how you want it to look, and she can do it. Just don't let her make any choices."
Mrs. Shing began to take my measurements. She was a woman of few words. I asked Rulin to translate my questions. Mrs. Shing pursed her lips as she wrapped the tape measure around me. But she refused to answer. Then, finally, in Cantonese, Mrs. Shing spoke: "Will you tell her that she has to wear a bra in a qipao!" 
In the jungle heat that day, and in my haste, I had not worn a bra under my sundress.
Nothing like a little commerce to bridge the generation gap. The stony Mrs. Shing, nevertheless, continued to measure me. She was focused; only the greatest affront could have moved her to speak.
I was told that I could return to Shenzhen in a week and my qipao would be ready.
Our family holiday continued. In Beijing, our next stop, we saw the Great Wall and the Forbidden City. I met relatives I didn't know I had. I was a head taller than all of them. My mother introduced me to my Auntie Hwa Dong. And then to Auntie Hwa Dong's younger sister, Auntie Dong No. 2; her younger brother, Uncle Dong No. 3. Sadly, my Uncle Dong No. 4 had not been able to make the reunion.
They were our relations who had watched as my grandfather and other members of the family boarded a plane to Taiwan when the Communists took over in 1949. Left behind, they suffered the Cultural Revolution. They came from a landowning family, the most hated class. They watched as their father stood on a stage with other landowning "criminals," while epithets and garbage were hurled at them. He fell off the stage and shattered his shoulder. No doctor would treat him because he was untouchable. He was paralyzed for the rest of his life. In Beijing, dust storms blew through every day, leaving grit in our mouths and a sting in our eyes.
In Shanghai, I held my parents' hands for the first time since childhood. The traffic stops for no one, and no one stops for traffic. The city was not only overwhelming, it also felt surreal. I met Al Gore in a hotel elevator. I ate snake (one of the milder Chinese delicacies I tasted -- one menu featured "Jade Colored, Chrysanthemum Shaped Ox Penis," another offered a platter of entrails, brain and tongue).
Shanghai is known for three things: the cuisine, the prettiest girls in China and its tailors. The tailors are extraordinary. The Chinese word for "master" is sifu, and these are master tailors. Creators of modern qipao in the 1920's -- a Westernized riff on the traditional Manchu costume from the Qing dynasty of the 17th century -- the sifu of old sewed qipao by hand out of one piece of cloth. Although the process has evolved, or devolved, from hand to machine, the standards remain high. So just in case anything went wrong at Mrs. Shing's in Shenzhen, my mother suggested we shop for qipao in Shanghai as well.
On the Nanjing Road, the main shopping thoroughfare, beyond the expensive European boutiques, is a store called Silk King. At the Silk King, in addition to plenty of silk, they have a 24-hour qipao service.
Li Hong Gen would be my sifu. Unlike Mrs. Shing, Sifu Li loved to talk and to instruct. "Can you understand me if I speak slowly?" he asked in Mandarin. He took his role of teacher seriously.
"Qipao is best made with a stiffer fabric," he said, showing me my choices. "It is a formal dress. It needs to have its own dignity. It needs to fit your body smoothly. If a fabric is too soft, it will ruin the effect."
I liked a traditionally patterned red silk. My mother shook her head.
"It's so old-fashioned. You're going to look like a grandmother," she said. "Or a Chinese restaurant."
She pointed to a zebra-print silk.
"But, Mom," I said, "this doesn't look like yours."
"Why should it have to look like mine? This is your qipao. You're American. You're from a different generation."
The sifu spoke. He didn't see the dignity in zebra print.
We compromised, as most global fashionistas might: I got both, the red and the zebra.
Sifu Li took my measurements. He drew patterns on colored rice paper. We chose the cut of the sleeves, the height of my collar, the silk for the edging, the fastenings. A messenger on a motorcycle would take my order to a factory where people worked late into the night to make rough cuts by morning. Even though my tailor was a master, no one made qipao entirely by hand anymore. Factories, cheap labor and an era of Mao suits had rendered the sifu of my mother's generation obsolete.
The next morning I arrived for my first fitting. The rough cuts had paper collars. The stiff fabric stuck out around me like a silk fat suit. Sifu Li pinned and tucked. He told me to walk, to sit down. As I plopped down on a bench, he cried out and grabbed my arm.
"No, no, no, no! There is a manner to qipao. A way to sit. Like this."
With his fingertips he pulled his pant legs up delicately and sat in an almost side-saddle fashion. I thought of my grandmother, who sits this way even today, the better portion of her life spent in qipao.
"Now you try," the master said.
I lowered myself slowly, following the give of the dress and the fabric. The dress defined my movements. There was only one way to sit.
"Yes, yes. That is the way."
At the final fitting the next morning, my mother put on her glasses to inspect both the red and the zebra garments. "There's a bubble in the fabric," she said of one. "Don't you think this should be tighter? Not like this, like this," she said, pinching and pulling.
To me it looked fine. But when my mother the surgeon was through consulting with Sifu Li, and the alterations were in place, I stood up straighter. I raised my chin. When I sat down in my qipao, I sunk into position, the way my mother had, and my grandmother before her.
"I don't think you look like a grandmother after all," my mother said when I tried on the red. "You look like a Chinese lady."
The dresses would be finished and sent to our hotel within the hour, the whole process, from pins to suitcase, clocking in at just over 36 hours. I bowed my head to my sifu and pressed my hands together, a traditional Chinese way of paying respect.
"Thank you, Sifu," I said in my best Mandarin. I felt more Chinese already. I had my first qipao.
As we walked out, my mother shook her head. "Sifu is pronounced 'SHUH-fu,' like 'LAU-shuh' -- teacher.' You've been saying 'SHE-fu.' You've been calling him your daughter-in-law this whole time."
Back in Hong Kong, with my parents' visas sorted out, we were bound for Shenzhen to retrieve qipao No. 1. It was a Saturday, a day off back home, but here the sound of power tools and progress cut the yellow air, thick with dust and smog.
It took a while, but we found Mrs. Shing's shop. I tried on the dress. It didn't feel right. The closures were loosely attached. The stitching was puckered on the shoulders. A dart was not symmetrical. I had developed an eye.
Like a good Chinese girl, I had come for my first qipao. Like an American, I was leaving with three. Even more American, I was still unsatisfied. None of them measured up to my mother's. But now I knew what I was looking for. There is a manner to qipao. I had learned from my mother and my sifu.
Soon my younger sister would be wanting a qipao, too, and I would come back to show her the way.

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT'S REPORT; 
Strapped Airlines Add Fees and Taxes to Fares

BYLINE:  By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
PROF. Charles Lucy of the University of Alberta found a real bargain air fare this summer, even for the discount airline WestJet -- just $3 Canadian to fly from Calgary back to Edmonton, where he lives. "I booked it on the Internet, where you get $2.50 off, so the fare was just 50 cents," the chemistry professor said of his late June flight. He could have gone round trip for a dollar Canadian. 
 Tacked onto his 50-cent ticket, however, were fees, taxes and surcharges for everything from the cost of security screening to improvements at the Calgary airport that raised the total price to nearly $40. "These fees are really annoying, especially on short trips where they can double the advertised air fare," Professor Lucy said. 
 WestJet sold 300 tickets for as little as a dollar Canadian round trip in late June to make a point about how governments are larding tickets with fees, often flat sums that weigh most heavily on tickets for short haul or advance purchase travel.
In the United States, where Congress has been busy cutting taxes, it has also been imposing fees on travelers to make up for some of that lost revenue. 
To pay for airport security following Sept. 11, travelers now pay a federal airport security fee of $2.50 per flight segment, with a $10 limit on round-trip tickets. There is talk in Washington of doubling the fee to $5 with a $20 limit. 
Airports in the United States can charge a passenger facility fee of $4.50, and now some airports are adding a departure fee. Chicago charges $5 to each passenger whose flight originates at O'Hare or Midway, while Denver charges $1.86. Boston and all Florida airports charge similar fees. 
The airlines themselves are adding on fees and surcharges as they struggle to cope with a decline in passengers since Sept. 11 and as the economy has cooled. Airlines are also raising existing fees as they struggle with what stock market analysts project will be a $5 billion loss by the industry this year, following $7 billion of red ink last year, wiping out all the profits in the industry's history. 
Sue Juliano, a senior editor at Consumer Reports Travel Letter, said that extra fees "have always been around, but we are seeing them more and more and not just at airlines." 
"The travel industry is hurting," Ms. Juliano said, "and they are resorting to nickel-and-diming consumers, which can engender resentment." 
Add-ons now average $49 for a four-segment round trip, the Air Transport Association, the airline trade organization, estimated. 
United Airlines doubled the one-way fee for children traveling alone to $60 last fall. US Airways charges $40 for children alone on direct and nonstop flights and $75 for connecting flights. 
The charge to change a discount ticket is now $100 at most airlines, four times the fee in the mid 1990's. On international tickets the change fee is $150. 
Fees for airline clubs are also on the rise, even as hours are being reduced and fewer magazines and snacks are offered. 
Kevin Mitchell of the Business Travel Coalition, which lobbies for lower fares, noted that most airlines have eliminated or cut back discount fares for older travelers, raised fees for extra baggage to between $50 and $80 per bag, and raised fees for traveling pets to as much as $65. 
To cut costs airlines have moved to electronic tickets and tried to steer customers to their own Web sites, which saves the airlines about $3 a ticket by avoiding the reservations systems used by travel agents.
Then there are fuel surcharges. Continental, followed by American and United, dropped $20 one-way fuel surcharges recently, but passengers will not save any money. The airlines just folded the fuel charge into the basic ticket price. 
Customers would never find the $20 fuel surcharge if they looked for the figure 20 on a one-way ticket because that is not the number used to disclose the surcharge in the string of one- to four-letter codes and numbers on a ticket receipt. Joseph Hopkins, a veteran spokesman for United, had to consult with one of the carrier's ticketing experts before he could confirm that Q 18.6 on a ticket receipt was the pretax fuel surcharge of $18.60. The other $1.40 is the 7.5 percent federal excise tax, which is wrapped into a separate coded disclosure of the total federal excise tax on the ticket. 
There is one fee that travelers may like: Delta, America West and National are selling last-minute upgrades to otherwise empty seats in first class for $40 to $200 depending on the airline and length of the flight. 
Not all the extra fees travelers now face show up on tickets. In March, Delta stopped paying commissions to travel agents on most domestic flights, and most other domestic carriers quickly followed. To survive, travel agents now add their own fees; many charge $20 to $50 to issue a ticket. 
And then there is what may be the biggest hidden fee: unused e-tickets. Unlike paper ones, which are reminders that they can be cashed in or applied to a new ticket, e-tickets exist only as digital code in cyberspace. With unused e-tickets, after as little as 13 months, depending on the airline, the code vanishes and the airline pockets the money.

HEADLINE: Oh, to Be Taken Seriously When You Look About 16 

BYLINE:  By MELINDA LIGOS 

 BODY:
ARAH LOVE has always had a baby face.
 But when she was job hunting last fall, she tried to mask her youthfulness by wearing mascara and dark eyeliner, pulling her hair back into a sophisticated style and speaking in a voice as low as Demi Moore's. 
 Miss Love, who graduated in May 2001 from Boston College, had found in the midst of her job search that prospective employers were turned off by her teenage looks and high-pitched voice. So after a few months with no offers, she opted for a head-to-toe makeover intended to make herself appear more mature. 
She got makeup tips from a Bobbi Brown cosmetic artist at a department store counter, and traded in her long ponytail for shoulder-length hair with multiple layers. She also practiced speaking in a lower, more serious tone.
Four months after she began her search, in October 2001, Miss Love finally landed a job as a publicity assistant for HarperCollins, the publishing firm in Manhattan. She thinks her new look helped seal the deal.
"My young appearance definitely worked against me," she said. "It was a big struggle I had to overcome."
A few years ago during the dot-com boom, young-looking job seekers were embraced by many industries, especially in fields like information technology, where they were perceived to have more technical expertise than their older counterparts.
Now, such workers find that their looks can be a strike against them.
"Right now, companies have the advantage of being highly selective," said Paul Ray, chief executive of Ray & Berendtson, an executive search firm in Fort Worth. "If you look like you're 12, employers may write you off."
This is especially true in industries like financial services or sales where new hires often must make presentations or pitch new business to prospective clients, Mr. Ray says. "In this economy, a young-looking worker may not exude enough credibility," he said.
Even older workers who look years younger than their age can be at a disadvantage, according to Steven Rothberg, president of CollegeRecruiter.com, an online site in Minneapolis for job-hunting students and recent graduates. "Employers are placing a premium on maturity," he said.
Take the case of a job seeker in his late 20's who went to Susan Battley, founder and chief executive of Battley Performance Consulting, a consulting firm in Stony Brook, N.Y., for advice on how to appear less youthful. Even though he had an M.B.A. in hospital administration and a solid resume, the man felt he was being overlooked by executive recruiters and hiring managers because he looked like a high school student.
"He said, 'Interviewers take one look at me and think the physicians will eat me for breakfast,' " Ms. Battley said.
She recommends that young-looking job seekers conduct mock interviews with people of different age groups and both sexes. These should be taped, she says, and listened to for annoying mannerisms, like slang words or nervous laughter, that make the speakers seem unpolished and immature. She also urges people to speak slowly and in a deep voice.
What you say is still more important than how you say it. Ms. Battley counseled the hospital administrator to relate war stories about how he had handled demanding physicians in the past, for example. And she advised a woman in her early 30's who had been turned down for several jobs as an information systems manager to modify some of her mannerisms, like giggling too much and averting her eyes. "This undermined her professional presence and credibility," Ms. Battley said.
After receiving coaching, both individuals received job offers, she said.
On the other hand, experts caution job seekers against trying too hard to stifle their youthful exuberance. Peggy Klaus, an executive coach in Berkeley, recalls a recent session with a University of Pennsylvania graduate who was seeking a job on Wall Street. The woman's professors had urged her to refrain from smiling or expressing enthusiasm about anything, Ms. Klaus said, and so she arrived in her office wearing a drab brown suit and speaking in a monotone.
"That was the worst advice she could have received," said Ms. Klaus, who told the woman to loosen up and smile, wear fashionable clothes and talk about herself and especially about experiences, like helping her grandfather run a business, that would convey her enthusiasm for her intended career.
The tribulations of looking like a teenager do not necessarily end after people land a job, either. In fact, the more important their position, the more painful coping with all the funny looks and wisecracks can be.
"When I go in to pitch new business, I get some awkward responses from people," said Damian Bazadona, the 26-year-old president of Situation Marketing, a Manhattan Internet strategy and consulting group.
In one recent case, he says, he and another young-looking business partner had just begun a presentation, when a middle-aged woman in the room interrupted and said, "What are you guys, 16 years old?"
"It sort of went downhill from there," said Mr. Bazadona, who did not get any business that day. "Once you lose credibility like that, it's hard to recover it."
Another time, he says, a customer in his 50's gave him a such a hearty slap on the back that he went tumbling over the man's couch. "He was like, 'Hey, buddy, how's it going?' and then I went flying," Mr. Bazadona says. "He never would have done it if he had perceived me as his peer."
Career strategists say the best way to avoid being treated like a kid is to address a prospective employer's or client's concerns at the beginning of a meeting, and then impress them with your knowledge and expertise.
"Have a goodie bag of retorts," Ms. Klaus suggested. "If someone says, 'Oh my God, you look like you're 13,' say, 'That's a wonderful compliment, but I'm much older than I look.' " Use others' thoughtless comments about your appearance as jumping-off points to talk about your job experience, she suggested.
That is the strategy Michael Ertel adopts when looking to sign up clients for his new public relations consulting business. Mr. Ertel, who lives in Orlando, Fla., is 32, but still gets carded for cigarettes at his local 7-Eleven. "I always start off a presentation by acknowledging the fact that I look much younger than I am, and then I go a little bit into my 10 years of successes in the business," he said.
Mr. Ertel also sprinkles speeches with comments like how his wife just celebrated her 40th birthday, aimed at educating his audience about his age. "I see them raise their eyebrows when I mention my wife, and I know that adds credibility," he said.
One ploy Mr. Ertel has abandoned, however, is growing facial hair. "I attempted that once, and I just ended up with a bunch of peach fuzz," he said. "I looked like a kid trying to grow a beard."

HEADLINE: THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 8-18-02; 
Soul Training

BYLINE:  By Mark Edmundson; Mark Edmundson teaches English at the University of Virginia and is the author of "Teacher," which has just been published by Random House.

 BODY:
We teachers celebrate New Year's Day twice a year. We celebrate it first alongside everyone else, with paper hats and Champagne and "Auld Lang Syne" and mornings-after. But the first day of school is our second New Year's. It is our day to make resolutions, to look backward to former lapses and triumphs and to look ahead, usually with a mix of anxiety and hope, to the year to come. It is around this time of year, mid-August, that I, and I'll wager many other teachers, too, think back to our own great teachers. It is now that we vow to emulate them if we can. We pledge to do for our students what our own best teachers did for us. 
 But at least as I see it, genuinely great teaching -- the sort of thing that Socrates and his spiritual descendants have delivered -- is exactly what the American education establishment is now working to discourage. Many of us are being told that our primary task is to prepare students for fact-based tests, to stuff our charges with information, like Christmas birds. We are also being pressured to act as uncritical supporters, sometimes even cheerleaders, for our students. We are encouraged to inflate our grades, pushed to turn our recommendations into exercises in Madison Ave. puffery, urged never to say or even imply a critical word about students. More and more, the culture is asking us to be part of the service economy, providing our customers with what they think they want rather than what we believe they actually need. This commercial approach can also be seen on the supply side: to counter shortages all over, teachers are being sought everywhere -- from abroad, from different professions, from the volunteer ranks, as if anybody will do. 
 If I have high expectations for the profession, that is because I have been especially lucky in my own teachers. The one who made the greatest impression on me -- the one I'm inclined to pledge to emulate when I make my teacher's New Year's resolutions -- was a high-school teacher, and an unprepossessing one at that. I can still picture him standing in front of our class on the first day of school, September 1969. What we saw was a short, slight guy in his early 20's with olive-toned skin -- we thought he might be Mexican -- wearing a skinny tie and what looked like his grandfather's suit, about two sizes baggy, with a large paper clip fastened to the left lapel. On his feet were outrageously unhip gunboat shoes, lace-ups designed in homage to the Monitor and the Merrimack. His accent seemed ridiculous to us working-class Massachusetts kids, absurdly overrefined. He talked like a dictionary. It seemed certain that we Medford High kids, in a state of permanent warfare against our teachers, were going to win our run-in against the diminutive fellow of the droopy moustache and the inscrutable paper clip.
One day, this teacher sent the most popular, smart and athletic guy in the room out to do an errand. When he returned, about 20 minutes later, he found the class in the middle of a game. On the blackboard were a dozen sets of parallel lines, some the same length, others radically different. When our teacher pointed to the congruent lines, everyone agreed that they were entirely different. Then, when the lines were different, all arms rose to affirm they were the same. Sometimes, the class star stuck to his guns, the only one with his hand up when the teacher asked if two, short, perfectly congruent lines were in fact the same. But other times he caved in. When all those hands shot up, like salutes at a rally, endorsing something absurd, Mr. Popular went along.
When the show was over and the teacher finally revealed that it was all a trick (an "experiment in conformity" was what I remember him calling it), our classmate was deeply chagrined. But then we all had to think -- we were forced to -- how well we would have done ourselves. And we had to admit that Mr. Popular was the best we had to offer. No one had his combination of smarts and easy confidence. We all would have more or less followed along, clip-clopping with the herd.
What our teacher had done was to diagnose our character. He had seen that we were creatures of conformity, unthinking lock-steppers. And he was willing to attack us. He did it with affection, and he created a classroom atmosphere in which we could say virtually anything and be sure of being accepted, but he also had the wherewithal to go at us, which is a central element in great teaching. There is humane aggression in being a great teacher, as well as genuine love. Socrates, the philosopher Alexander Nehamas has observed, looked into the minds and hearts of his students and let them know, kindly, generously, that he did not much like what he saw. Then he began to help them to change.
Virtually all of us teachers got into the profession because we have been inspired by someone like my teacher at Medford High. We have become determined that, as Wordsworth put it, "what we have loved,/Others will love, and we will teach them how." As we teachers head into our New Year's celebration on the first day of school, we will think about our own inspiring teachers and how they would have felt about the current consumer-oriented, test-obsessed state of American learning. And we will begin to fight, humanely and generously, against anything that stands in the way of our students' true growth -- and of our own.

I noted that she sat close by a little door, which door, I was well aware, opened into a small closet where books were kept. . . . Advancing up the room, looking as cool and careless as I possibly could . . . I slightly pushed the door and found it was ajar. In an instant, and with sharpness, I had turned on her. In another instant she occupied the closet, the door was shut, and the key was in my pocket. . . . They were stilled for a moment; then a smile -- not a laugh -- passed from desk to desk: then -- when I had gravely and tranquilly returned to the estrade, courteously requested silence and commenced a dictation as if nothing at all had happened -- the pens travelled peacefully over the pages, and the remainder of the lesson passed in order and industry."

HEADLINE: DANCE; 
Way Up High, Soaring, Floating, Diving, Dancing

BYLINE:  By WENDY PERRON; Wendy Perron, the New York editor of Dance Magazine, is a senior fellow at the Vera List Center for Art and Politics at the New School.

 BODY:
AN abandoned grain elevator rises high above the docks of Red Hook, Brooklyn. With 54 joined silos, it looks like a pack of gigantic cement ladyfingers. During its heyday, from the 1920's through the 50's, bulk grain was weighed, cleaned and dried there by laborers who lived in the neighborhood.
 From Thursday through Saturday, in "Picture Red Hook," Joanna Haigood will be scaling the heights of this massive 12-story grain terminal with her San Francisco company, Zaccho Dance Theater. Produced by the adventurous arts presenter Dancing in the Streets, the show is a result of several years' preparation to create a performance work involving the community. The area, which includes the Red Hook Houses, a large public housing unit, is a blue-collar neighborhood in transition. Troubled by drug-related violence in the past, it is now attracting businesses as well as artists in search of low-cost housing. 
 Last month in San Francisco, Ms. Haigood rehearsed in her studio, a former mattress factory that is rigged for aerial dancing. One woman, a few feet off the ground, was swinging like a pendulum, while another advised from the floor, "There's a little moment of weightlessness, and that's a good place to turn yourself around." 
In "Picture Red Hook," members of Zaccho Dance Theater (the name comes from the segment of a Greek column that anchors it to the ground) will expand that "little moment of weightlessness" into an extended foray of soaring 160 feet in the air. Seven dancers will strap themselves into climber harnesses that are clipped to cables. The cables will be secured to the structural steel at the top of the building. Two more lines will be anchored to the ground on either side of the audience, so the dancers can fly directly overhead, hundreds of feet in front of the silos. (Note to the audience: bring lawn chairs or blankets.) 
Asked if aerial dancing is risky, Ms. Haigood replied, "We all work very very hard to take the risk out of the work." Still, though the dancers are intensely watchful during what mountain climbers call "the approach," there are risks. "You have to watch that you don't knock your head when you come into contact with any surface," said Suzanne Gallo, a dancer and choreographer who is a member of Zaccho. 
In a practice session, one dancer momentarily lost control and looked like a fish out of water, flopping against a wall. Another got an instant skin abrasion and had to wrap a layer of neoprene around his hips before re-harnessing. But aerial dancing, done correctly, gives the dancer a powerful sense of freedom that translates into a kinetic and psychic thrill for the audience. 
In "Picture Red Hook," the dancers will glide through space using airborne versions of familiar actions like running, jumping and diving. A theme of harvesting, with movements reminiscent of cutting grain, becomes transformed as the cutting gesture lifts the dancers further into space. Behind them, projected onto the facade of the silos, will be a video that includes larger-than-life faces of local residents talking about their hopes and dreams for the neighborhood. They were interviewed by Mary Ellen Strom, a video artist who is collaborating with Ms. Haigood on the project. 
Ms. Haigood, 45, is a graduate of Bard College, where she was influenced by Aileen Passloff. She later attended the London School of Contemporary Dance, which has a curriculum based on Martha Graham's teachings. "It wasn't suiting me very well," Ms. Haigood said of the conservatory-like program. (She had studied dance improvisation with Lorn MacDougal, a disciple of Daniel Nagrin.) "I went on some wonderful escapes with a neighbor who had been an aerialist with Barnum & Bailey. She took me to circuses, where I got to see the Flying Wallendas."
Ms. Haigood incorporated what she learned into her choreography. "It was interesting to get off the flat two-dimensional plane and explore movement that was lateral, diagonal and vertical," she said.
Ms. Haigood creates site-specific works, delving deeply into the history of each place. She has brought her flying techniques to a variety of settings, including a clock tower in San Francisco and the wooded area surrounding Jacob's Pillow. She has created works on subjects like the Underground Railroad, the paintings of Chagall and the first African-American labor union, the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters. (Ms. Haigood is of mixed race. Her father, a retired Army officer, is black and her mother, a retired school administrator who was born in Germany, is white.)
Called a "poet of memory" by The San Francisco Bay Guardian, she blends research and fantasy to evoke a world that draws the viewer in. Witnessing a work of hers can be both edifying and haunting.
Ms. Haigood, whose choreography is in the repertories of the Joffrey Ballet of Chicago and Alonzo King's Lines Ballet in San Francisco, relates aerial dancing to a personal dream world. Dancing off the ground requires a disorientation that may be a clue to the magical quality that marks her work. 
Ms. Gallo observed: "You need a sense of ease being inverted. For Joanna, she does it all the time. When you're inverted, you look at the world differently; you respond differently; you have a heightened awareness."
In a large-scale project like "Picture Red Hook," the producing organization usually plays a major role. The idea, according to Aviva Davidson, the executive director of Dancing in the Streets, is for artists not just to plop down a work of art in the middle of a neighborhood but rather to engage the community as a collaborator. "Picture Red Hook" is part of a 10-year arts initiative between Dancing in the Streets (www .dancinginthestreets.org) and Red Hook that includes an annual Young People's Performance Festival, arts education programs and site-specific works. In Ms. Haigood, the organization has found an artist who merges innovative ideas with a commitment to community. 
For the last few years, Ms. Haigood and Ms. Strom have given creative workshops in Red Hook schools. One project sent middle-school children to social events to observe dances, culminating in a dance swap in which different generations taught one another the popular dances of their day. (Scenes from the swap appear in the video.) Another project trained teenagers to assist in interviewing residents. The final interviews from the neighborhood -- a mix of Italians, Irish, Latinos and African-Americans -- reveal a common desire to work together to address issues like toxic dumping, youth violence and gentrification. 
As Ms. Haigood prepared for the performances, she tried to picture the grain terminal decades ago. Built in 1922, the Port of New York Authority Grain Terminal was a stop along the Erie Canal shipping system until 1965, when the increasing use of container ships drove the waterfront activity to more open ports in New Jersey and Staten Island. According to John Quadrozzi Jr., president of the Gowanus Industrial Park, in the ensuing period of economic decline, the granary was infiltrated by crack users and prostitutes. Since 1997, when the industrial park bought the facility and surrounding lots and waterways, it has become part of Red Hook's renewal. 
Ms. Haigood regards the granary as a symbol of abundance, loss and revitalization. In that context, she said, "The flying represents the will to transcend social challenges." But there are formal factors as well. "For me, choreographically," she said, "working with the human body and the human scale next to something so colossal is an artistic challenge." 
"Picture Red Hook" will include live video close-ups of the dancers aloft, a sound collage by Lauren Weinger (grain pouring -- think ocean waves) and a stilt walker from the community. (A shuttle bus will be available to take dancegoers to and from the performances. The information and reservations number is (212) 625-3505.)
Ms. Strom has shot footage of the granary as well as scores of interviews for the video, which will be projected from scaffolding 25 feet high, at times giving the illusion that some of the silos are revolving. About the building, Ms. Strom said: "It's extremely beautiful in its purity of form. It looks like a 70's minimalist sculpture, like a Donald Judd upended." 
Mr. Quadrozzi said that the site had been used for scenes in the films "Vanilla Sky" and "Shaft," as well as for fashion spreads in Vogue and Elle (in its August issue). But nothing seems to have elicited the sense of wonder that Ms. Haigood's aerial dancing has. After watching her rehearse, he said: "She appeared to be flying in slow motion. She looked like a seagull up there. It's beautiful, and it's scary."
Seeing the economic polarization in the community between longtime residents and the new arrivals, Ms. Haigood decided to organize a group photograph of the people of Red Hook. Dancing in the Streets enlisted the help of churches, community centers and other civic groups. In the spring of 2001, residents from every sector gathered in a nearby baseball field. During "Picture Red Hook," this celebratory image, in which hundreds of people posed for the camera, will appear on the face of the historic grain elevator, radiating hope.

HEADLINE: MUSIC; 
Sondheim Has His Shrine, and It's Not on Broadway

BYLINE:  By JOHN ROCKWELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
LOOMING over the Potomac, with its faux-monumental 1960's architecture, the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts doesn't look much like Richard Wagner's wooden theater in Bayreuth, in bucolic Upper Bavaria. But this summer it has become a pilgrimage site just like Bayreuth, the faithful flocking to festive productions of the Master's well-loved works. Except that here and now, the Master is Stephen Sondheim.
 Mr. Sondheim is on a roll, one that transcends his core audience of avant-Broadway devotees. Classical and opera critics were much in evidence as, indeed, was anyone interested in American music and American musical theater, increasingly irrelevant subcategories like "musical" and "opera" aside. 
 Along with the six shows here (including "Passion," "Merrily We Roll Along" and "A Little Night Music," which close the celebration over the next week), one can cite the striking Japanese-language version of Mr. Sondheim's "Pacific Overtures" at the recent Lincoln Center Festival (to be reprised at the Kennedy Center early next month) and a solid account of "Into the Woods" on Broadway as well as planned productions of "Assassins" (a stillborn child from 1991) and the new "Gold" next season. And Bryn Terfel is scheduled to take on "Sweeney Todd" at the Chicago Lyric Opera in November, if he doesn't back out again, as he did with the New York Philharmonic's concert performances two years ago. 
In 2000, the annual Musical America directory named Mr. Sondheim composer of the year. Later there was a reception for the winners in a party room at Carnegie Hall. By all accounts, everyone showed up, many to honor him. There were uptown mandarins. (Mr. Sondheim studied with Milton Babbitt, who is a closet Broadway baby himself but also the most mandarinlike of the extreme dissonant musical tough guys.) There were downtown Minimalists and progressives of one stripe or another. There were the new Broadway composers of operalike musicals and musical-like rock songs. There were jazz stalwarts. In short, Mr. Sondheim had become the consensus candidate, the person everyone suddenly recognized as the right man for the job, the job being "best" American composer.
Of course, the very idea of "best" is a little silly, and "consensus" implies bland compromise. What was so striking about hearing all this Sondheim over a short span was being reminded how restlessly inventive he has always been, how he never settles into formula -- even formula of his own making. The eight shows heard in recent months pretty much cover the Sondheim canon. ("Follies" is the major omission, along with the early, atypical "Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum.")
Their range reveals the diversity of Mr. Sondheim's art, for all the consistency that underlies it: his haikulike musical materials, his enormously clever way with words (which makes ready appreciation of his work abroad, or ready translation, almost impossible), his impassioned seriousness of intent, his brilliance in finding collaborators, particularly book authors, to flesh out his ideas.
Just think of the differences, of subject and style: bright, bitter comedy in "Company" and "Merrily We Roll Along"; lush waltzes and European romantic complexities in "A Little Night Music"; nothing less than Japanese culture and its encounter with the West in "Pacific Overtures"; horror and operatic grandeur (leavened with Gilbert-and-Sullivanesque wit) in "Sweeney Todd"; profoundly intellectual yet emotionally telling explorations of the roots of art in "Sunday in the Park With George"; fairy-tale magic in "Into the Woods"; dark operatic intensity again in "Passion." Although Mr. Sondheim never repeats himself, never fulfills easy expectations, he rarely fails to satisfy a growing audience's yearning for challenging musical theater.
Yet exactly where is that growing audience coming from, and where will it be able to see and hear these works? Their appearance at the Kennedy Center carried symbolic value but also gave hints as to their future.
The Kennedy Center, often self-importantly, thinks of its business as bestowing the imprimatur of excellence. Its annual Kennedy Center Awards, which cover the full range from classical to every kind of popular culture, are easy to dismiss as an excuse for a television variety show and an advertisement for the center. But the Sondheim celebration was more substantive.
Logically enough, its primary purpose was to celebrate Mr. Sondheim. More insidiously, it might have purported to welcome him into the classical pantheon. As it happens, however, the center has had a long (if recently faltering) history of Broadway-style production, and its Eisenhower Theater is a real Broadway-size house, not an operatic barn like the New York State Theater at Lincoln Center, where Beverly Sills tried to present musicals in the 1980's.
The celebration served a secondary but not unimportant purpose: it announced the arrival of Michael M. Kaiser as the center's new president in the flashiest, worthiest manner. Mr. Kaiser, best known as a clever administrator, put his artistic stamp on the center with a flourish. And if his success owed much to his artistic director, Eric Schaeffer, and the rest of the celebration team, he knew enough to hire them in the first place.
Whatever its underlying intentions, the celebration was an admirably achieved affair. Despite the excellences of the Broadway productions, most by Harold Prince, and despite the natural tendency to compare everything else with those originals, these productions stood up nicely on their own.
The sets, all by Derek McLane, ranged from functional to ingenious to beautiful. If there was a problem among the various directors, it was a tendency (primarily by Christopher Ashley in "Sweeney Todd" and "Merrily We Roll Along") to slight seriousness in favor of yuks. But Mr. Schaeffer's own work, in "Sunday in the Park" and "Passion," was exemplary, and it helped certify those shows as particularly bright jewels in the Sondheim crown. The instrumental support was superb. Mr. Sondheim said that this was the first time he'd enjoyed a full orchestral complement since Broadway. And the casting was even better.
Which brings us to the ingenuity of how these shows were produced. The center may have been offering Broadway shows, but they were presented operatically, as it were, with limited runs in repertory. In a wrap-up article about the celebration last Sunday, a Washington Post critic wrote that "there is no significant precedent for this style of producing." Only if one limits one's perspective to the commercial theater.
Mr. Sondheim's career problems just start with writing shows that are often too smart to assure a long run. Producers, in this age of enormous costs and long runs of corporately conceived or Lloyd-Webberian shows, have been increasingly grudging about giving Mr. Sondheim a chance, especially in revivals. In a recent symposium he remarked that from now on, he'd prefer to work with nonprofits.
From one who had been a Broadway baby back to his babyhood, that was an illuminating reconsideration. Mr. Sondheim's whole life has been spent in thrall to Broadway. Despite the efforts of well-meaning critics and opera administrators to absorb his work into the operatic tradition, he insists that his shows are shows, and should be presented as shows.
But they aren't being so presented, at least at the highest level. The job has been taken over by regional theaters and schools, and by Europe, where the opera houses are small and the unlikelihood of competition from commercial productions encourages the American producers to relinquish the rights. In Europe, "Sweeney Todd" is a staple, but the other shows -- despite linguistic difficulties -- are beginning to make their way.
Mr. Kaiser's achievement was to conceive this Broadway celebration on operatic terms. By running the shows in repertory, he could assure a wide audience a considerable variety of work over a short time. By limiting the runs, he seemingly had his pick of stars -- John Barrowman, Lynn Redgrave, Alice Ripley, Brian Stokes Mitchell, Christine Baranski, Raul Esparza, Melissa Errico, Blair Brown, Douglas Sills, Randy Graff, Barbara Byrne, Judy Kuhn, Rebecca Luker, Michael Cerveris and others -- who might have been unwilling to commit to open-ended runs. The sheer richness of the casting -- the vividness of the personalities and the vocal ranges both quasi-operatic and conversationally simple -- was amazing.
The use of a single set designer made economic sense, with little loss in scenic variety or allure. For all those who remembered the opulence of the Broadway originals, there were others, encountering these shows live for the first time, who found the Washington productions amply opulent.
Not every nonprofit producing organization has a theater like the Eisenhower; Lincoln Center, for example, lacks one. Putting these shows in the hands of opera companies, where they get lost in theaters with 2,700 seats or more, is not the answer.
Maybe what we and Mr. Sondheim need is a summer festival in a plausible theater devoted to the best in operas and musical theater, irrespective of genre. We need to hear the best in musical theater, old and new, no matter the derivation of the particular work or the amount of dialogue or the singing style.
Or maybe we should confine our festival to American musical theater. Or maybe we should follow the Kennedy Center model completely, and wish for Mr. Sondheim to have a festival of his very own. His own Bayreuth.
In the meantime, New York can look forward to an all-star concert of highlights from the Kennedy Center productions on Oct. 21 -- in Avery Fisher Hall, another barn -- as well as to "Assassins" and "Gold." In the meantime, when it comes to newly considered schemes to keep these masterpieces of American musical culture alive, Mr. Kaiser has shown the way.

HEADLINE: THEATER; 
From a Gay Role on TV To a Lothario Onstage

BYLINE:  By ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
HE is in perhaps the hottest series on television, which pays him more than he ever earned onstage and recently landed him an Emmy nomination for best actor in a drama series. So you cannot help wondering why Michael C. Hall decided to spend his summer hiatus performing eight shows a week on Broadway instead of relaxing at the beach.
 But then you see him strutting the stage of the Shubert Theater in a tuxedo and white carnation, as women swoon around him while he croons "All I care about is love," and suddenly it makes sense. Isn't it every actor's dream to play a heartthrob in a hit Broadway show? 
 Mr. Hall may have become a familiar face because of HBO's "Six Feet Under" -- he resumes shooting the series' third season next month -- but he felt it was worth stepping in for a brief stint as Billy Flynn, the smooth-talking criminal lawyer in the long-running Kander and Ebb hit "Chicago."
Something else sweetened the deal: his wife, Amy Spanger, is playing opposite him as the winning but homicidal Roxie Hart. They have both signed on for only six weeks; Mr. Hall, 31, leaves the show after Sept. 10 to start shooting "Six Feet Under" in Los Angeles. Ms. Spanger will accompany him there.
In an interview the other day at a restaurant on Columbus Avenue, Mr. Hall described the part of Billy Flynn as "a great departure for me," particularly in contrast to his television role as David Fisher, a gay member of a family that runs a funeral parlor. "After having played this tightly wound, conflicted character, to play someone so at ease, in control, without conflict" is a welcome break, he said.
He is also enjoying the physical experience of belting his songs to the back of the house rather than performing in "the more contained world of the small screen." 
Appearing on a stage is not a departure for Mr. Hall. He is not a Hollywood actor looking for legitimacy on Broadway. He needs the stage in a different way -- because it is where he came from, and he does not like being away from it for long. 
"Before 'Six Feet Under,' I had never gone more than a month or two without doing theater," he said. "Now it's been more than a year and a half."
He has joined the growing ranks of television stars who have been gravitating to the stage, including several other HBO actors. Just last season, Sarah Jessica Parker of "Sex and the City" appeared in a Manhattan Theater Club production of "Wonder of the World"; her "Sex and the City" co-star, Cynthia Nixon, had roles in the "The Women" on Broadway and in "Free to Be You and Me" Off Broadway. And Edie Falco, of "Sopranos" fame, is currently starring in "Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune."
Mr. Hall's stage resume includes roles in "Henry V," "Timon of Athens," "Macbeth" and "Cymbeline," all at the Joseph Papp Public Theater; Terrence McNally's controversial "Corpus Christi" in 1998 at the Manhattan Theater Club, and regional theater at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles and at the Williamstown Theater Festival in Massachusetts.
He is also comfortable in singing roles, having played the M.C. in the current revival of "Cabaret" on Broadway, directed by Sam Mendes -- a Kander and Ebb musical with a dark sensibility similar to that of "Chicago." Mr. Hall met Mr. Mendes while performing in the 1999 workshop production of Stephen Sondheim's "Wise Guys," which Mr. Mendes also directed.
The M.C. as recreated by Mr. Mendes and Alan Cumming -- who originated the role in the revival -- wears corsets and heavy makeup and has direct contact with members of the audience. Mr. Hall said it was a decisive role for him. "You can get away with acting onstage and at times imagining your relationship with the audience is adversarial -- they're potentially critical and you might shut them out," he said. "With the M.C., I had no choice but to step out onstage and operate from a place of love for the audience."
"My motto," he added, "was 'never hide.' "
The singing in Mr. Hall's life came before the acting. Brought up in Raleigh, N.C., he was a member of his church choir and school chorus and appeared in his high school's musicals -- usually playing the character roles like the hired hand Jud Fry in "Oklahoma!" and Lazar Wolf, the butcher in "Fiddler on the Roof."
His mother is a school guidance counselor. His father, who worked for I.B.M., died of cancer when Mr. Hall was 11. "It was a tough time to lose him because I think our relationship was on the cusp of becoming richer," Mr. Hall said, adding that not a day goes by that he does not think of his father. 
It was at Earlham College in Indiana that Mr. Hall took his first acting class and began to think of theater as a career. Until then, he had assumed he would become a lawyer. He earned a master's degree in fine arts at New York University and immediately began getting work -- though he has collected his share of unemployment checks along the way.
Inevitably, seeing Mr. Hall being intimate with another man on television, as he is in "Six Feet Under," was an adjustment for some of his friends and relatives, the actor said. But Mr. Hall said he was mainly focused on the larger burden bestowed on him by the show's creator, Alan Ball: presenting something groundbreaking for television. "I wasn't so nervous about kissing a guy; I was nervous about getting it right," he said. "There was a sense of responsibility there, and a sense of excitement."
Mr. Hall met Ms. Spanger nearly six years ago and they were married in May. They live on the Upper West Side of Manhattan and have temporary digs in Los Angeles. Barry Weissler and his wife, Fran Weissler, who produced "Chicago," thought it would be fun for the newlyweds to be onstage together, and it looks as if it is -- especially when she is flopping around on his lap as the puppet to his ventriloquist during "We Both Reached for the Gun."
"It seemed like a no-brainer to bring them both in as a team," Mr. Weissler said, adding that the box office had shown a decided jump since Mr. Hall went into the show. 
Ms. Spanger had played Roxie before, in the musical's first national tour. She also stood by for Roxie and the other leading female role, Velma Kelly, in the Broadway production, which was directed by Walter Bobbie and opened in 1996.
It can be tough for a married couple to be in the same field -- show business unions have a particularly bad record -- a reality that Mr. Hall said he is well aware of. "It's like anything else, it requires attention," he said. "But I am much better for the support Amy gives me. She's a real advocate. And I'd like to be the same for her."

The Lost Boys: How a Pop Sensation Came Undone

BYLINE:  By NEIL STRAUSS 

 BODY:
THE Backstreet Boys have sold more than 65 million albums around the world, a number that few pop acts have surpassed. In their prime, in the 90's, they were a pop juggernaut, breathing new life into MTV, the record business, children's radio, teen magazines and teenage purchasing power.
 But along the way, they were surpassed by a very similar band with the same management, songwriting and production team: 'N Sync. As 'N Sync's star rose, the Backstreet Boys seemed to disappear. Music industry observers have offered scattered reasons: the Backstreet Boys lost their young audience when they tried to fashion a darker, more adult look; they alienated love-smitten fans when two group members married; they damaged their image when they admitted that the band member A. J. McLean had checked into rehab for alcohol abuse and depression. 
 But there is more to the story. Or more precisely, the Backstreet Boys' ups and downs are part of a larger story, one about the music industry today. It's about five young men put to work as pop puppets who develop minds and ideas of their own, then find out what can happen to long-term ambitions in a consolidating industry in which quarterly profits are crucial, professional relationships are not what they seem and pop groups are treated like disposable products. 
The history of rock and roll is littered with broken bands and dashed hopes. But what distinguishes the Backstreet Boys' story is its scale, one involving deals worth as much as $100 million that the band members now say were a mistake, causing them to lose control of their careers.
"The business is over here," Kevin Richardson, at 29 the oldest group member, said recently, stretching his left hand out. "And the artistry," he continued, stretching out his right hand, "is over here."
The story begins with Lou Pearlman, an aviation entrepreneur based in Florida (and cousin of Art Garfunkel). Inspired by the success of the 80's heartthrobs New Kids on the Block, who happened to charter a plane from him, he decided to recruit and groom his own clean-cut boy bands. After a series of auditions in 1992 and 1993, he recruited Nick Carter (the youngest at 12), Howie Dorough, Mr. McLean and Mr. Richardson, who was 20 and whose cousin, Brian Littrell, soon completed the Backstreet Boys lineup. Mr. Pearlman booked them at grade-school assemblies, shopping malls and Sea World, and assigned management duties to Johnny Wright, who had worked with New Kids on the Block.
A year later, Jive Records, an independent label best known for its hip-hop acts, was coaxed into signing the Backsteet Boys. But the band's first single, "We've Got It Going On," sputtered in America, where its sweet, harmony-laden pop was out of step with the alternative rock of the time. So in 1995 the band's first album, "Backstreet Boys," was released in Europe and Canada, hitting the top 10 in numerous countries. Jive and Mr. Pearlman kept the band busy overseas for the next two years, sometimes putting it on tour for five months straight.
When teenybopper bands like the Spice Girls and Hanson began to succeed in the United States, Jive and Mr. Pearlman decided to bring the boys back. In the fall of 1997, an American version of "Backstreet Boys" was released and, over time, its popularity wore down skeptics at radio stations and MTV. When the album crossed the 10 million mark in sales, it heralded the cultural arrival of Generation Y.
"They were probably single-handedly responsible for the advent of 'Total Request Live,' for Radio Disney, for Teen People becoming the force it has become, and, no doubt, for the explosion in teen purchasing power in America," said Barry Weiss, the president of Jive. "They pushed the envelope."
As with nearly all sudden pop sensations, a conflict soon grew between the band members, who wanted time off to relax and find perspective, and the business forces behind them, who wanted to keep the momentum going.
"The Backstreet Boys got so big they got tired," Mr. Pearlman said. "And after a while, it became not about managing them but reasoning with them."
Matters grew worse when a doctor recommended in the spring of 1998 that Mr. Littrell have surgery because of a leaky heart valve. "I remember management at the time saying, 'Can't you postpone it so we can finish the tour?' " Mr. Richardson said. "And this just hurt Brian so much because he was like, 'Dude, this is my heart.' " (Mr. Pearlman said that he had supported taking time off for the operation immediately.)
Meanwhile, Mr. Pearlman rolled out his next big boy band: 'N Sync. That summer, the Backstreet Boys decided not to accept an offer from Disney, which wanted to broadcast a concert special. Mr. Richardson said that he and his bandmates were exhausted and wanted to spend time with their families.
"That left the door open for 'N Sync," Mr. Pearlman said. "And 'N Sync walked through the door."
Mr. Richardson said that 'N Sync worked hard and deserved the breakthrough. The Backstreet Boys directed their anger at Mr. Pearlman and his management team, coming to believe that it was a conflict of interest for them to handle such mirror-image acts. "They were directing them to work with all the writers and producers that we worked with," Mr. Richardson said. "And they were using 'N Sync against us, saying, 'Oh, if you guys don't do this gig, we'll just book 'N Sync.' "
In response to accusations from Mr. Pearlman and others that the band lost its drive, he said: "We tried to find a balance. We got tired of being taken advantage of. That's the bottom line."
So the band took its contracts to outside lawyers, who discovered that Mr. Pearlman had legally made himself a sixth member of the group, meaning that he was able to keep 17 percent of the money he distributed to the band after taking his 15 percent commission, according to court documents.
The Backstreet Boys filed suit in 1998, claiming that they had only received $300,000 since 1993 while Mr. Pearlman and their managers had reaped $10 million. In an interview, Mr. Pearlman defended his business practices, saying that he had spent $3 million on the Backstreet Boys before the band had earned a dime. He added that it is common practice in the music business for a company to earn its investment back before paying the artist.
As the battle intensified, the band found itself unable to proceed with a planned tour, Mr. Richardson said. "They locked our production equipment and stage and everything up and said, 'You guys are supposed to do a tour, but you're not getting your equipment,' " he recalled.
The band reached a settlement that allowed Mr. Pearlman to retain, among other things, one-sixth of the band's profits.
It was around this time in 1999 that the Backstreet Boys, who were being managed by Mr. McLean's mother, held a meeting with executives of a two-year-old management company called the Firm, which represented bands like Korn and Limp Bizkit. Two executives from the Firm, Jeff Kwatinetz and Michael Green, showed up backstage at a concert in Orlando, Fla., and, after being kept waiting for an hour outside the group's dressing room, burst in and made their pitch.
The band members were impressed by these brash young executives who promised them greater control of their careers, a larger share of revenues and innovative promotion and merchandising. With the help of the Firm, the Backstreet Boys sued Mr. Pearlman several more times, until he renegotiated the settlement on terms more favorable to the band. Executives of the Firm said that the Backstreet Boys had bought out Mr. Pearlman's stake in the band, but Mr. Pearlman denied this.
The Backstreet Boys retained the Firm's own lawyer to represent them; later, they transferred legal duties to John Branca, who manages most of the Firm's top clients.
Here, commercially and personally, began a glory period for the Backstreet Boys. In 1999 their CD "Millennium" sold 1.1 million copies in its first week -- more than any album before it. "Millennium" became the best-selling release of the year (more than nine million copies), while the accompanying tour raked in $37 million. Merchandise sales brought in millions more.
THE windfall was good for those around the group, too. It thrust Jive Records into the highly lucrative teen-pop market. (Impressed by its teen-pop sales, BMG, which already owned 20 percent of Jive's parent company, recently purchased the remainder for $3 billion, the most ever paid for an independent record company.)
In the meantime, according to executives who worked with the band, the Firm negotiated tens of millions of dollars in advance payments for recordings and performances from Jive and the concert promoter Clear Channel. This helped the management company finance its growth. It soon became a powerhouse in film and music, with a current staff of about 240 people. It acquired the sneaker company Pony, a chain of stuffed-animal stores and the merchandising rights to the cartoon aardvark Arthur. It also started buying other management companies, most notably Michael Ovitz's Artists Management Group earlier this year.
David Baram, the president and chief operating officer of the Firm, denied accusations -- from rival managers, and from Aaron Ray, a former partner in the Firm -- that the Firm was built off the backs of bands like the Backstreet Boys. "Our success is totally a function of never making short-term decisions for our artists," he said. "We've been fortunate enough to grow our business where we're not dependent on any particular commission check."
One thing at which the Firm excels is battling record labels on behalf of its acts. The executives who worked with the band say the Backstreet Boys had a heavily one-sided deal with Jive, which owned most of the band's merchandising, film and other rights. In addition, on Jive's books the Backstreet Boys still owed the label money, which meant that despite being the most successful band of their time, they weren't getting a penny in royalties from their record label, according to the band's past and current managers.
In a contract renegotiation, the Firm managed to loosen some of the label's restrictions on the band and secure a $65 million advance, a figure that many in the Backstreet Boys camp confirmed. (Though the band only received 30 percent of the money up front; the rest comes with album deliveries and sales bonuses.) Executives who worked with the band said that the Firm had made use of the Backstreet Boys' irritation at Jive's latest coup: the signing of 'N Sync, which had also sued Mr. Pearlman and found new representation.
The band's subsequent album, "Black and Blue," signaled the end of its glory days. "That record -- and I'm not complaining or blaming anyone because it sold a lot of copies -- for me personally, I wasn't happy with it," Mr. Richardson said. "I felt like we should have experimented more. But there was all this pressure and fear from our label and our management company."
Executives of the Firm said that the rest of the band had been happy with the album and voted to release it, especially since any further changes would have meant missing its Christmas-season release date. To promote the album, the Firm worked closely with Wal-Mart, MTV and Burger King, which paid several million dollars to sponsor the band. (According to executives close to the band, Jive Records, which was not included in the Burger King deal, made a separate deal for 'N Sync and Britney Spears with McDonald's, whose campaign beat Burger King's by about a week.)
In the end, "Black and Blue" actually beat the first-week sales of "Millennium," selling 1.6 million. (It went on to sell a total of 5.3 million.) But what should have been a triumph was hardly seen that way by the industry. That was because 'N Sync's new album, "No Strings Attached," had sold 2.4 million copies in its first week. The 'N Sync album followed a ubiquitous No. 1 single, "Bye Bye Bye"; the Backstreet Boys had not released such a successful single early.
"We made a lot of right decisions when we put the Millennium tour together," Mr. Richardson said, "but because of that success, people in our organization got comfortable and weren't being so cautious anymore."
Other factors were undermining the band. Executives working with the Backstreet Boys said band members had stopped getting along after the release of "Black and Blue." Executives with the Firm were also frustrated with the band for not working as hard as 'N Sync seemed to be, especially in making public appearances. Furthermore, Mr. Littrell's wife, Leighanne Wallace, who was critical of the Firm, began exerting a major influence over his decisions, according to executives close to the band, incurring resentment both within and outside the group.
The relationship with the Firm grew worse when the band began to work on its tour to support "Black and Blue." Clear Channel offered to buy the entire tour outright for $100 million, a figure the group's managers jumped at.
As it turned out, Mr. Richardson said, "it was a big mistake."
"When people were throwing that big number on the table, it was tempting, but we asked questions, we asked about ticket sales, we asked about the control aspect, and we were told not to worry," he said, referring to his management company. "And it hurt us."
To make money, he said, Clear Channel had to set extremely high ticket prices, shutting out many Backstreet Boys fans. A spokesman for Clear Channel said that the steep ticket prices had actually been pushed by the Firm, and that Clear Channel had fought for lower prices, telling the management company that the ticket costs were "obscenely high" and "detrimental to the band's career." (Mr. Baram of the Firm said that the final decision had rested with Clear Channel, and that ticket prices had been set that were comparable with tours by similar acts.)
Tickets did not go on sale until January 2001, months later than originally planned. The economy dipped and pop music sales began to sag, along with the entire boy-band phenomenon the Backstreet Boys had spearheaded. Ticket sales were less than expected, and the venues were scaled back from stadiums to arenas. Mr. Baram said that The Firm had made this decision, sacrificing millions of dollars in commissions, because playing to half-filled stadiums would have been greatly damaging to the band's image and career.
"When the tour went down to arenas, it was renegotiated so that it wasn't $100 million," Mr. Richardson said. "When 9/11 happened, and when A. J. went into rehab and we took two months off, that's another renegotiation. So that $100 million, that's not $100 million."
Again complicating the situation was 'N Sync, which put its tour tickets on sale a week before the Backstreet Boys did, a move the band interpreted as intentional on the part of 'N Sync's business associates.
In the end, out of what was supposed to be a deal worth $100 million, band members received $6 million to $7 million each, less than half of what they were expecting, according to executives involved in the deal.
From the band's perspective, the money wasn't the problem. The bigger problem was that such large deals, while lucrative for the band and the business people around it, were harmful to its members' long-term careers and the needs of its fans. And the worst was still to come. As 2001 came to a close, Jive Records had not released a blockbuster teen album. So it decided to rush a Christmas release of a Backstreet Boys greatest-hits CD.
The band members say they resisted, feeling that it was too early in their careers for such an album and that it would ruin their longheld plan to mark the group's 10th anniversary in 2003 with a greatest-hits release.
"Our management company was supportive and we weren't," Mr. Richardson said of the album. "And the record company was going to put it out anyway. So it's either promote, or fight with your label, don't promote it and risk it doing very badly. But ultimately, who is it that's going to get hurt? It's not going to hurt our label. It's going to hurt us."
Despite threats from the band, Jive Records put out the album after long debate. Mr. Weiss of Jive defended the label's decision, saying that the greatest-hits record sold nearly six million copies worldwide, yielded an international top 10 hit ("Drowning") and served to keep the group's profile up.
Mr. Weiss did not respond directly to many of the band's grievances. "If you look at the annals of the entire record industry," he said, "any expert would defy anybody to say that Jive didn't do the best job in the history of this kind of music."
However, Mr. Richardson and his current management said the band planned to commission an audit of its financial relationship with Jive. The band, he said, was still "unrecouped" -- industry parlance for when a record company says that a band hasn't earned back the money the company has spent on it. With multi-million dollar advances against future sales (a move that Firm executives said made sense, considering how difficult it is, even for a band this big, to get royalties from a record label), there may be good reason the band wouldn't be receiving royalties yet.
"I'd rather not get into it," Mr. Weiss said about the royalty situation. "The Backstreet Boys do not have anything to worry about financially. These guys are set for life based on the money they've received from this label."
Last March, the Backstreet Boys had a group meeting because they felt that they weren't getting the personal attention they needed and had been used to before the Firm expanded. "They've built a huge, very powerful company, and they're good people," Mr. Richardson said. "But this past year, some bad decisions were made and some bad advice given."
With Mr. McLean and Mr. Littrell strongly advocating leaving the Firm, the band walked into the offices of the Firm to deliver an ultimatum. Much to the band members' surprise, the Firm did not put up much resistance to their leaving. The bigger shock came when the other group members found out that Nick Carter, arguably the most popular of them, had chosen to remain. The Firm told the group that it would manage his solo career, and the band stormed out.
Afterward, in an unexpected move, the group signed on to be managed simultaneously by two industry veterans, Howard Kaufman and Irving Azoff.
In the meantime, Jive is taking a great interest in Mr. Carter as well as in Justin Timberlake of 'N Sync, an apparent shifting of focus from groups, which are more costly and difficult to manage, to solo acts. With no blockbuster pop releases this year, the label, according to industry observers, has little choice but to bank on releasing a Nick Carter solo album by the end of the year. Mr. Weiss of Jive said that he considered the solo album, due to be released in October, ahead of the next Backstreet Boys album, "part and parcel of the reinvention of the Backstreet Boys as a whole."
Many industry observers, however, feel that these moves are detrimental -- if not lethal -- to the bands. "Nick wants to go solo, so does Justin," Mr. Pearlman said. "And if I was more a part of their careers, I'd ask: 'Does this help the group? How does this help the other guys?' "
Currently, Mr. Carter is choosing among 35 songs he has recorded for his album. The rest of the band is recording demos without him, using a number of producers, including Babyface, Jermaine Dupri and Glen Ballard. The more rock-oriented material made with Mr. Ballard, who produced Alanis Morissette's albums, shows an evolving, maturing direction.
Mr. Azoff said that he had signed on to help the band members with their commitment to a long-term career. Whether that will happen remains to be seen, but Mr. Azoff is unconcerned with the current debate over tensions between the band and Mr. Carter. "Whether Nick is in the band or not, it doesn't frighten me," Mr. Azoff said. "The Eagles changed members three times, and it didn't hurt their career."

HEADLINE: In the Region/New Jersey; 
Contradictory Signals From Commercial Property

BYLINE:  By ANTOINETTE MARTIN 

 BODY:
TWO powerful trends seem to be clashing in commercial real estate in New Jersey, market experts say. Corporate consolidations and layoffs have produced painfully high vacancy rates in many cities. Meanwhile, the market for sales of commercial properties as investment is remarkably healthy. 
 "The way we're selling property now, we are going to have the busiest year we have ever had," said Andrew Merin, executive vice president of Cushman & Wakefield of New Jersey. 
 In their midyear report issued in July, Cushman & Wakefield analysts reported that in the first half of 2002, the dollar volume of sales of investment properties was roughly comparable to that in the year-earlier period. There were more sales, C.& W. said, but the average size of the buildings sold was much smaller than in 2001. 
Vacancy rates are up sharply this year compared with last for all types of commercial property, except retail, according to the report. Of the four types of commercial property, "office, industrial, retail and multifamily residential," the hardest hit has been office space. "Class A vacancy rates have skyrocketed from 10.5 percent at year-end 2000, to 14 percent at year-end 2001, to 15.4 percent at the end of this year's first quarter," the report said.
In a few places, Newark and Parsippany, for example, there were slight improvements in the vacancy rate, according to the report. But along Interstate 287, in Middlesex County, the vacancy rate more than quadrupled to 27.1 percent from 6.6 percent; in Somerset County, also on Interstate 287, Franklin Township had the highest vacancy rate in the state, 41 percent, up from 15.3 percent just a year ago. Vacancy rates along the Route 78 corridor nearly tripled, to 24.8 percent from 8.7 percent. In the Meadowlands and the Woodbridge-Edison area, rates more than doubled, to 17.4 percent and 15.6 percent, respectively.
With office space, demand is based on job growth, "and that is flat," Mr. Merin noted. He added a sober prediction. "Once the job growth picks up, it will be another 12 months or so before the demand begins to grow," he said. "A significant recovery may take from one to three years."
And yet, Mr. Merin is among market professionals who cite a surge in sales of commercial properties. Mr. Merin said C.& W. recently brokered the sales of six large properties: the Essex Green Shopping Center in West Orange and five office buildings in Florham Park. It is now working on deals for four properties each valued at more than $100 million, he added. 
Mr. Merin referred to the robust investment market coming in the face of the anemic economic climate as a paradox.
GVA Williams's president, David Simson, meanwhile, said his company had experienced a surge in business, with a half-dozen sales in process, and described the situation as a disconnect between vacancy rates and the pace of sales.
And Jon Mikula, senior director of the financial intermediary company Holliday Fenoglio Fowler, said that despite the poor economy and burdensome vacancy rates, lenders were not reporting increased delinquency on loans. "It's a strange phenomenon all around," he said, joining the chorus of incredulity.
One obvious factor in stimulating investment sales is that interest rates are at historic lows, market experts agree. Lynn DeMarco, director of the Capital Advisors Group, Insignia/ESG, said, "The current low interest rates are allowing investors to be aggressive and still achieve appropriate returns."
But rates have been startlingly low since the beginning of the year. So what else is spurring investment at the moment? 
"From the lending point of view," Mr. Mikula said, "it is partly that it is time to get money out the door. At the beginning of the year, with the stock market uncertainty, many lenders decided to allocate more money for real estate. But with the economy not doing so well, there haven't been enough transactions to utilize nearly all of it. 
"So now it's summer, the lenders have these grandiose allocations and plans, and they have got to get this capital on the market. Money becomes cheaper, and the terms less conservative."
It is possible for investors, "even individual investors," to borrow up to 85 percent of the value of a property at an interest rate of 6.5 percent or even lower, he and other market experts said.
ONE mortgage banker, CIBC World Markets' managing director Michael Higgins, confirmed that banks will generally finance mortgages for up to 75 to 80 percent of sales price, and insurance companies will secure mortgages up to 85 percent on "good quality real estate."
"The reason is," Mr. Higgins said, "most investors today realize that you've got some good solid leases on commercial properties, and we are not overbuilt as in the 80's." 
GVA Williams recently marketed a 185,000-square-foot office complex on Route 78 in Lebanon, Mr. Simson said, in which approximately 15 percent of the space is vacant but all the current tenants have five or more years left on their leases. "The property was an enormous attraction," Mr. Simson said. "We had over 15 qualified buyers and now have a signed contract with a New Jersey company."
Mr. Simson said GVA Williams also recently sold two office buildings in Parsippany, where the vacancy rate has been 20 percent or higher for more than a year. One of the buildings, on Walsh Drive, was 98 percent leased, with 70 percent of the space leased for 8.5 years, he said; the other, on Campus Drive, was fully leased and sold with competitive bidding.
Mr. Simson said his company expected a rising number of bidders in the marketplace, up about 25 to 30 percent from last year.
Class A office buildings that are substantially leased for the next five years are the most sought-after properties, according to Mr. Merin and Mr. Simson. But some investors are pursuing alternative strategies.
Robert C. Kossar of the J. G. Petrucci Company said his company was trying an end run around furious competition by trying to buy office buildings that may be in second-rate locations or not fully leased.
Mr. Kossar, who heads both acquisitions and leasing for J. G. Petrucci, conceded that with the leasing market so stagnant, "it does seem a bit strange to be out there looking to acquire vacant office buildings."
"What you have to do is find an opportunity and think ahead," he said. "If you buy an asset now, you have to plan for 24 months of vacancy. We think it's likely the market will be soft that long, but it is coming back, and you have to position yourself for that." 
J. G. Petrucci recently acquired Post Office Plaza in Somerville, Mr. Kossar said. The 85,000-square-foot building has two empty units of 3,500 and 4,500 square feet on the first and second floors that were previously bank offices. Mr. Kossar said his company was banking on the excellent leasing history of the building.
"It has a great location," Mr. Kossar said, "at the crossroads of Routes 22, 202, 206 and I-287. Newark Airport is within 20 miles. It is across from a train station, and employees can have lunch at 10 different restaurants within a few blocks."
He said his company tried to "dig and dig and dig to find value," and then, "Essentially, we place a bet on what we find."
"It's actually a good time to buy," he said.
Or sell, Mr. Merin said. "The current wave of capital will be short-lived," he predicted in a speech delivered at the midyear economic roundup held by the New Jersey chapter of the National Association of Industrial and Office Properties. "When it dries up, it is likely that the market fundamentals will still be questionable."
Mr. Merin advised state property owners that the finance market was "as good as it's going to get right now." If owners have stable tenants in a building, they should take advantage of the situation, he said, and "consider exiting now."

In-Office Surgery: Fewer Rules Apply

BYLINE:  By MICHELLE ANDREWS; Michelle Andrews is a freelance writer in Manhattan specializing in health care. Her column on its economics appears the third Sunday of each month. E-mail: moneymeds@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
WHEN Susan Houston needed a colonoscopy about five years ago, her doctor suggested doing the procedure in an operating room attached to his office. Before the procedure, she said, the doctor administered two shots -- one of Demerol, a narcotic painkiller, and one of Valium, a sedative.
 But Ms. Houston, 62, a psychoanalyst from New York, said the drugs did not work. "I was wide awake through the whole thing," she said, recalling how she watched on the video monitor as the scope snaked through her intestine. "It was painful; I had cramps. It was one of the most anxiety-producing experiences I've ever had." 
 Office-based surgeries and other procedures have become increasingly common -- from colonoscopies to cardiac catherizations to cosmetic surgeries. About one-quarter of the estimated 35 million outpatient surgical procedures performed last year took place in doctors' offices, up from 14 percent in 1990, according to Verispan, an industry research company in Newtown, Pa.
Many office procedures are completed without a hitch. Still, a hospital would entail fewer risks for difficulties like those experienced by Ms. Houston. For example, anesthesiologists generally administer and monitor sedatives in hospitals.
To maintain state and federal licensing and accreditation, hospitals must have medical equipment and people in place to handle emergencies. But only 10 states, including New Jersey, California and Florida, now regulate office-based surgery, through state-mandated requirements or accreditation by one of three groups, according to a recent study in Health Affairs, a journal. (Most set standards for anesthesia, equipment and patient monitoring.)
"Office-based surgery is the Wild West of regulation," said Blair Horner, legislative director for the New York Public Interest Research Group, a research and advocacy organization.
Of course, regulations alone are no panacea. Dr. Rebecca Twersky, an anesthesiology professor at SUNY Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn, says it's difficult to ensure that doctors performing procedures in an office have the proper credentials, particularly for some popular cosmetic procedures like liposuction. 
"In a hospital there's a governing body that reviews a physician's credentials," Dr. Twersky said. "In a doctor's office, it's often the doctor himself who's deciding whether he's competent to perform."
Dr. Twersky also leads the American Society of Anesthesiologists' task force on office-based surgery, and she helped draft guidelines on behalf of the New York State Department of Health. Those guidelines were voided in a state court last November after a group of nurse anesthetists challenged the department's authority to impose such rules. 
Medicare and some health plans, though, seem to favor office-based surgery, which costs a lot less than surgery in a hospital. Doctors, in fact, are often paid more to perform procedures in their offices than in hospitals. Under new payment schedules that took full effect in January, Medicare pays a doctor $459.37 if he does a colonoscopy in his office, but only $205.25 if he does the same procedure in a hospital.
The rationale? Physicians should get extra compensation to cover office personnel and overhead costs.
Yet even some medical groups are opposed to the payment system. "We're concerned about potential safety hazards," said Kathleen Teixeira, director of government affairs for the American Gastroenterological Association. "You're giving physicians an incentive not to do procedures in hospitals or ambulatory surgical centers."
When things go wrong in office-based surgery, it's often because of cardiopulmonary problems from the anesthesia. Hard data on safety is hard to come by, but one study published in the April 2000 issue of Pediatrics, the medical journal, found that in 95 pediatric cases in which there was a problem during sedation, the patient was three times more likely to die in a nonhospital setting. 
"In some offices, the only backup they have is dialing 911," said Dr. Charles Cote, a professor of pediatrics and anesthesiology at the Northwestern University School of Medicine, who conducted the study.
Patients who have office-based surgery can take steps to ensure that they get the best care. For starters, Dr. Twersky suggests asking the doctor how many of the procedures he or she has performed in an office, and whether the procedure can and should be done elsewhere. Dr. Twersky also suggests learning the qualifications of the person who will be administering the anesthetic. An anesthesiologist is ideal, she says, but a nurse anesthetist supervised by a physician is an acceptable alternative. Ask, too, about emergency backup and who is responsible for watching patients in recovery.
WHEN Ms. Houston went in for another colonoscopy this month, she told her new doctor about the painful experience during the last procedure. (She said her last doctor had told her that the Demerol did not work properly because she once smoked.)
Rather than administering the anesthesia himself, Ms. Houston's new doctor used an outside source, Resource Anesthesiology Associates in New Rochelle, N.Y. The company sends an anesthesiologist to the doctor's office with equipment in tow to sedate and monitor a patient.
This time, Ms. Houston's procedure was uneventful. "They put me out, and the next thing I knew I was lying there recovering," she said. "It was easy."

HEADLINE: No Memos. No Meetings. No Paychecks. 

BYLINE:  By KATE STONE LOMBARDI 

 BODY:
NEAL GOMBERG had experienced professional shake-ups before. In the often volatile advertising business, he had lost a few jobs and had always quickly landed on his feet. This time the layoff came in early September. And this time, landing on his feet was not quite so easy.
 Just six days after his boss walked into Mr. Gomberg's office to deliver the bad news, the World Trade Center was attacked. At first, it simply seemed wrong to be searching for a new job during the horrific aftermath of the event -- insensitive, under the circumstances, to make inquiries. But Mr. Gomberg, who lives in Chappaqua, needed work. 
 At first, he approached the job search as he had every other. He has a strong list of contacts and he began to make calls. Within a few weeks, he had called every name on his list. 
"All of them said that there were no jobs here, and not only are there no jobs here but we're laying people off," Mr. Gomberg said. "Then I had no game plan. I was just wondering how long I would have to endure it."
He endured it for roughly five months before he found a new job; a lucky break, Mr. Gomberg said, since he knows people in advertising who have been out of work for a year. In this economy, five months doesn't seem too long to be unemployed. But, Mr. Gomberg said, "it felt endless at the time because the scary part was not knowing how long it was going to last." 
Mr. Gomberg was one of thousands in the area who have found themselves suddenly unemployed. Some saw it coming. Others were shocked. One man spent an evening at his investment banking firm trying to determine how his division would cope with anticipated cutbacks. The next morning he discovered he was on the list of those let go.
New York State's unemployment rate in June 2002 was 6.1 percent; up from 4.7 percent in June 2001. The unemployment rate among Westchester residents was 4.2 percent in June 2002, up from 3.4 percent in June 2001. It was the 15th consecutive month of rate increases in the county and the highest June unemployment rate since June 1996, when the rate also was 4.2 percent. 
Several major employers in the area have cut their staffs dramatically. I.B.M., with world headquarters in Armonk, is the county's largest employer. The corporation confirmed last week that it had dismissed 15,613 employees over the last year, though it did not say how many of the layoffs were in Westchester. 
But as the ranks of the unemployed swell, the numbers tell only part of the story. Coping with being out of work -- the emotional fallout, the financial pressure, the frustration of looking for a new job, even the unexpected benefits -- is new territory for many, particularly in the affluent suburbs. Of course, the experience of being unemployed in Westchester varies as much as the profile of those who live here. One former truck driver from New Rochelle said he had filled out more applications than he could remember and had yet to get a job interview. The man, 34, who declined to be identified, said he would soon be forced to give up his apartment and move in with his brother and sister-in-law, a situation he described grimly as "a real last resort."
A Thornwood resident, who also declined to be identified, had spent decades in the accounting field. But since losing his job last October, he has struggled to remain emotionally positive and financially solvent. The man, 53, exhausted his unemployment insurance last month. He has a mortgage to pay and a son in college. His wife has a job, but not one, he said, that "we can get by on." The couple have dipped into their savings and sold the stocks they were hoping to hold on to until retirement. 
In the husband's nearly yearlong search for work, he has used the Internet, employment agencies and head hunters. Recently, he has begun to consider looking for work outside the region, perhaps in Philadelphia or southern New Jersey, and commuting home on the weekends. 
"It's very tough," he said. "People are still laying off and certainly not in the hiring mode. After awhile you get unsure if you really want to stay in the area. You say a prayer and you try to get on with looking."
Even those who had high-paying, white-collar jobs are struggling with adjustment. Those who had severance packages that still cover their unemployment may not be immediately concerned about their credit card payments or health care coverage or losing their homes. But men and women who were used to high-profile careers are also shaken by the experience of waking up to a closet full of business suits, a sleek laptop on the table and no place to go.
One of the first things most people have to deal with is the sharp blow to the ego that follows dismissal. No matter that in the current economy a layoff is rarely personal. It feels personal.
"After the initial shock, you have to remember that it's not necessarily about you and you can't let it knock your ego into the ground," said Peter Zurkow, who was laid off from his job as an investment banker for UBS Warburg. "It was personally insulting, but it's the banking world."
Mr. Zurkow, a Scarsdale resident, was well aware that the banking industry was not terrifically secure. He knew that there would be layoffs when his firm merged with Paine Webber. But Mr. Zurkow was protected by a contract. He was in close contact with someone highly placed in the organization who was familiar with the cutback plans. Getting laid off was a surprise.
"When they let me go, they never said the word 'fire,' " Mr. Zurkow said. "They said, 'We've chosen to accelerate payments on your contract so we no longer need your services."
After personally digesting the dismissal comes the difficult chore of going public with the news. Many people who were out of work said they felt almost a compulsive need to tell not only family and friends but also near strangers that they were financially secure despite their current joblessness. They said they felt they must explain that they had severance packages or savings to tide them over.
"I almost had to choke off the need to tell people, 'Don't worry, I'm financially O.K. for a couple of months,' to wipe off the shame that I had been tossed," said one Bronxville man, a former banker who did not want to be identified.
AND then there is the ubiquitous question at social gatherings -- "What do you do?" -- that suddenly becomes a source of anxiety.
"It took me a while to get over 'What do you do?' " said John Taylor, of Pleasantville. "I think I'm beyond that now. What's harder is the feeling of insecurity that you don't have a job to go to the next morning."
Mr. Taylor was working as a partner at KPMG, the consulting firm, when the company went public. Seeing "the handwriting on the wall," Mr. Taylor said, he took a severance package and left in April 2001 and recently took an interim job. Originally, Mr. Taylor planned to take the summer off and find work in the fall. 
"That took us to September, and all of the sudden when I looked to get back in the mainstream, there wasn't much of a mainstream to get back to," he said.
To be out of work is to live with near-constant anxiety. No matter how generous the severance or sizable the savings, it is a rare ex-employee who can go on indefinitely without work. And it is difficult to enjoy the down time, because there is always a nagging feeling that there is some call to be made, some action to take, to find a job.
"It's difficult to walk around and act like everything is fine and put on a brave face when you really don't know how long it's going to last," Mr. Gomberg said. "You're sitting there thinking, 'What could I be doing in any way to help my cause and look for a job?' You think you should always be on the phone, e-mailing someone, contacting someone. Every moment you're not looking for a job you feel guilty. But the Catch-22 is, there are no jobs."
So many who began with a game plan for their day -- rise early, make phone calls, check e-mail messages, polish and repolish the resume, make more phone calls -- quickly found their contacts exhausted and their days yawning with extra time. Yet it was not time that could be enjoyed as a vacation or as an opportunity to do all the things one has always wanted but never had the time for -- because the unemployment was too anxiety producing. Mr. Gomberg, for instance, had dreamed that he would work on his novel when he had time; instead he was too anxious to sit down and write. 
Some found ways to release the tension. Mr. Zurkow, along with some unemployed friends, took hiking day trips in upstate New York. Mr. Taylor spent time landscaping his backyard, finding the manual labor therapeutic. And of course, many played a more active role in their family lives, picking up and delivering children to school, lessons and sports practices, and as Mr. Zurkow said, "learning the other mommies' names." He observed that unemployment had given him some odd and uncomfortable moments. 
"Like the question of 'Where were you on 9/11?' -- well, I was making beds and watching CNN," he said. 
NONE of this is easy on the wives, whether they are working or at home. The financial pressure, of course, was most pronounced.
"It was probably a lot harder on my wife than me, because all of the sudden she was the sole breadwinner, and that put a lot of pressure on her," said Mr. Taylor, whose wife, Phong, works at I.B.M.
Some wives spoke privately about the frustrations of having their husbands both underfoot and depressed. Donnovan Beckford, director of the Office of Workforce Investment, which runs five employment centers in the county, said that he often heard about family tension.
"I just got a call from a woman whose husband had worked in a high-tech industry, very successfully, a very skilled man," Mr. Beckford said. "She said: 'I just need to talk to someone. It's so frustrating. He goes out every day, he says he's looking for work, and I'm sure he is, but nothing is happening.' "
Of course the economy has hit women hard in the workplace too. 
Sue Byrne, of Ossining, lost her job in March. She had been the managing editor of New Choices Magazine, a publication of Reader's Digest. The magazine, which was once known as Harvest Years, had been publishing for 41 years when it folded.
At first Ms. Byrne was not overly worried about finding a new position. A veteran of the tumultuous magazine world, her previous job had been at Parade magazine, where she had been the managing editor of React, a special publication for teenagers. That magazine stopped publishing in May 2000, but before she even had time to complete her obligations at her old job, suitors began to call.
"The day the announcement was made, I had, within hours, Hearst Magazines calling me, Time Inc., calling me," Ms. Byrne said. "I wasn't worried about finding another job in the least. I had people coming to me. What a difference two years makes."
Indeed. This time, the phones haven't been ringing with new offers. Ms. Byrne still doesn't have a full-time job. She has filled her days with freelance work, which does not pay as well as her former job. Her 16-year-old son plans to attend college, and financial pressures are on the horizon.
"In two years I'll have to pay college bills, so while I'm happy for the time being, ultimately I am worried," she said.
Despite the financial concerns and emotional difficulty of unemployment, it has not been an entirely negative experience for everyone. Some people report that they have gained a new perspective on their lives, reconnected to their families and re-evaluated their priorities. 
For Ms. Byrne, the freelance work has allowed her to manage the logistics of family life, enabling her to drive her son to his summer job as a lifeguard and be home when her 12-year-old daughter is off from camp.
Once they were over the shock of being out of work, the men interviewed for this article said they were grateful for time they could spend with their families. 
"Being out of work has been one of the most fulfilling times in my life," Mr. Taylor said. "Losing my job is the best thing that could have happened to me in the time frame that it did, because this has turned out to be the peak years with my son and daughter."
Mr. Taylor's last job required him to be consulting in Pittsburgh from Monday morning until Thursday nights. The time spent away from his son George, now 13, and Emily, 10, took its toll. 
"I was pretty guilt ridden about missing the kids," Mr. Taylor said. "I would try to get by by them faxing me homework. I would call at night. But when you're a kid that gets old quickly. 'What did you do in school today?' 'Oh, stuff.' I've been in information technology all my career, but in this age of the Internet there's still nothing that beats personal contact as far as the kids are concerned." 
Mr. Taylor and his wife had employed a nanny in the past. A few months after Mr. Taylor lost his job, they let the nanny go. Mr. Taylor soon became expert in the suburban parenting quandary of having to be at two places at once, racing from one child's activity to the other.
HE became a fixture at his son's soccer, baseball and hockey games, and coached his daughter's basketball games. He had coached before, he said, often arriving directly from the airport and coaching in his suit. This year, he had time to prepare for practices. Now he never coaches, as he sees other fathers do, with a cellphone in his hand.
Mr. Zurkow reported enjoying the time with his children, ages 9, 4 and 3, but also developing a newfound appreciation for the job his wife, Erica, does managing three small children and the household.
"It's much harder being at home than I imagined," he said. "The routine is so demanding -- the constant rejiggering, the play dates, the sports, the whole thing is so complicated. You have to be at so many different places at so many different times."
While Mr. Zurkow was out of work, he got to know his town better, and met other men who had been laid off. 
So many people were out of work from the technology industry, Mr. Zurkow said, that they joked about forming a Scarsdale Technology Council, just to get together. They talked about having breakfast meetings, Mr. Zurkow said, until they realized they could be "Dads who lunch." 
Besides the interim position as a chief marketing officer for a software startup, Mr. Taylor recently opened his own consulting firm, both of which he can do from home. He reports that head hunters have approached him about consulting jobs that require 70 percent travel, and he has politely turned them down.
"It's a little bit of a struggle because I'm still ambitious and I would like to get back in and make a name for myself and get my picture in Business Week and all that," Mr. Taylor said. "But the special relationship with my kids means a lot more. But I'm not ashamed anymore to say I'm a stay-at-home dad."
Mr. Zurkow, who was out of work for nine months, is now an investment banker at Investec in Manhattan. He said that he still missed his time at home and that it had influenced how he views his career now.
"I'm still mourning the passing of that time," he said. "There were moments that I wouldn't have missed for anything. And I'm much more protective of my personal time than I was before."
One other benefit of prolonged unemployment that was universally reported -- the sense of gratitude when it ends. 
"I'm lucky to have a job -- it's like your mantra," said Mr. Gomberg, who is now working for an American branch of a large advertising agency based in Japan. "You don't have the luxury of complaining. You catch yourself, and then you remind yourself. You're lucky to have a job."

In New Jersey, Warehouses Lead the Way

BYLINE:  By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
HARTZ MOUNTAIN INDUSTRIES does not shy away from glamorous projects. It has hotels in SoHo and TriBeCa and an office building in the high-end shopping area at 61st Street and Madison Avenue.
 But the president of Hartz, Emanuel Stern, said the family-owned company was built on something more prosaic: warehouses and distribution centers, many on what were once swamps in northern New Jersey. 
 "Our industrial properties are 97 percent occupied," Mr. Stern said. "They are a good, steady income producer, and you don't have the rebuild them for each new tenant." The company recently completed two 350,000-square-foot distribution centers in Secaucus, both leased before construction began. 
Real estate executives say that demand for industrial property in New Jersey never fell off as much as the demand for office space and that the warehousing and distribution sector should lead the economic recovery. "People have to have a place to put merchandise when they ship it to the New York City area," said Paul Cohen, an executive vice president of SBWE Real Estate, which specializes in industrial property in New Jersey.
As a result, the vacancy rate for industrial space in northern New Jersey in the last five years has stayed surprisingly low -- with a high of 8.6 percent in early 1997 and a low of 5 percent in the third quarter of 2000 -- according to figures compiled by Cushman & Wakefield, a brokerage and services company.
In the same period, the vacancy rate for offices in the northern part of the state ranged from a high of 15.5 percent in early 1997 to a low of 9.4 percent in the second quarter of 2000.
The vacancy rate for industrial property in the second quarter of this year was 6.2 percent, compared with 13.6 percent for offices, according to the figures.
Much of the merchandise arriving in the area comes in containers from ships unloading at the Port of New York, which is, for practical purposes, in Newark and Elizabeth, N.J. Shipments through the port are expected to double by the end of the decade.
There is increasing interest in industrial space in northeast New Jersey, both for its proximity to the seaport and to the region's labor pool, for sorting and processing goods. It is already a major industrial location.
"Northern Jersey is the top tier of industrial markets, with 700 million square feet of space," said Frank M. Lopriore, a managing director Insignia/ESG, a brokerage and services company. "It ranks third, behind Los Angeles and Chicago," and its industrial properties are dominated by warehouse and distribution facilities, rather then heavy manufacturing.
But a shortage of good sites in northeast New Jersey is forcing some developers to consider brownfields -- contaminated industrial sites that can be reused once they are cleaned to standards set by the state. 
"We are hearing a lot more chatter about brownfield sites," said Stanley Danzig, a broker with Cushman & Wakefield of New Jersey, an affiliate of the New York-based company. "Much more of that is about to go forward."
Other developers are turning south to build, including a cluster of distribution centers about 30 miles southeast of the New York area, near Exit 8A of the New Jersey Turnpike. Much of the area was once farmland, and there are few brownfield problems. The large expanses allow the construction of buildings bigger than are possible closer to New York and room for ever-longer tractor-trailers to turn and park. In addition, the fact that the area is thinly populated means fewer complaints about truck traffic.
"There are very few locations where you can put up a one-million-square-foot building," Mr. Lopriore said. "That's what drove the 8A market." According to Cushman & Wakefield, there are at least three prospective tenants looking for a million square feet of space in the area, including DaimlerChrysler and Home Depot. With many of the most desirable sites at Exit 8A already developed, interest is shifting to Exit 7A, about 20 miles to the southeast.
Matrix Development recently signed leases to fill a 528,000-square-foot building at 24 Engelhard Drive near Exit 8A, said Kenneth Griffin, the company's senior vice president for development. One, for 307,000 square feet, was with Petco, an animal supplies company, and the other, for 221,000 square feet, with the Postal Service.
In spite of the relative ease of developing on greenfields, as uncontaminated properties are known, Matrix is interested in brownfields because of their proximity to the port, company executives said. One site in Perth Amboy was formerly operated by Chevron, the oil company, which is handling the cleanup. When the cleanup is complete and approved by the state, the 25 acres will be able to support a light industrial building of 450,000 square feet. "We could do a built-to-suit" facility, tailored to one company's specifications, Mr. Griffin said, or build on speculation without a specific tenant. He said a built-to-suit project was more likely because of the level of interest.
Although warehouses and distribution centers are big boxes, they can vary considerably in their interior layout depending on their use. The two most recent Hartz Mountain buildings in Secaucus are examples. One, operated by Corporate Express, which sells office products, has a minimal lobby and offices. The other is operated by the Lantis Eyewear Corporation, which has corporate offices as well as the storage racks and conveyor systems of the warehouse. There, the lobby is several stories high and nicely finished, with abundant windows to allow in natural light.
The interiors of the warehouses are finished by tenants, often with elaborate material handling systems that may not be useful for subsequent tenants. A classic case was a Hartz building at 2101 91st Street in North Bergen that was leased by Webvan, an Internet-based grocery delivery service. Before it went bankrupt, Webvan equipped the building with a highly sophisticated storage and retrieval system tailored to its planned operations. "I had to pull out $30 million worth of racking" before the building could be marketed to other tenants, Mr. Stern said.
MATRIX, which is based in Cranbury, in the Exit 8A area, has continued its foray into northern New Jersey by leasing the Newark Legal Center for 99 years from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Thetransaction is similar to the one the Port Authority reached last year with Larry Silverstein on the World Trade Center, though considerably smaller. More recently, the company agreed to buy a vacant six-acre site in Newark between the Legal Center and the Passaic River from Public Service Electric and Gas, one of the state's major utilities. Plans for the site are not complete, but Mr. Griffin said the company intended to create a mixed-use development along the increasingly popular riverfront, including offices, homes, parking and possibly a hotel.
Mr. Griffin said Matrix had been looking at sites in places like Newark and Elizabeth if only because of pressure to limit development on greenfields and redirect it to older urban areas that may have lost population, but where the transportation links and other infrastructure are already in place.
The Rockefeller Group of New York is an active developer in New Jersey, with projects in Mount Olive Township in northwest Morris County and Florham Park near Morristown. It recently completed a 887,000-square-foot distribution center for Pearson Education at its Foreign Trade Zone in the Exit 8A area. Mr. Danzig of Cushman & Wakefield, which represents Rockefeller Group, said the Foreign Trade Zone status means import duties are not immediately imposed, giving tenants an advantage by bypassing long lines at the port.
"The inspections at the port have been more rigorous since 9/11," he said. But goods bound for the trade zone do not need customs inspections, "so people there are getting their goods two or three days earlier than in other locations."
Two or three days matter to companies that are looking to reduce costs by optimizing their supply chains, said Eugene E. Preston, vice president for development and marketing for the Rockefeller Group, which once managed Rockefeller Center and still manages four buildings on the west side of the Avenue of the Americas opposite the landmarked center.
The building to be used by Pearson Education on the 153-acre site is one of four that can be built with a total of two million square feet of industrial space, Mr. Preston said. And the Rockefeller Group owns an adjacent 36 acres than can accommodate a 400,000-square-foot building. All will be developed as built-to-suits, he said, with tenants signing leases before construction begins.
Mr. Preston and other real estate executives said an essential difference between the companies' operations near the exits in central New Jersey and those in the Meadowlands is the geographic scope of their businesses. Because New Jersey is about the midpoint of the Boston to Washington commercial corridor, distribution centers at the exits ship to the entire region. The ones close to New York are mostly focused on the city and northern New Jersey.
The knowledge that sites near the exits will someday be filled is forcing Rockefeller Group executives to consider brownfield development. "We have looked at a number of brownfield locations, but have not done a deal yet," said the company's senior vice president for development, Leslie E. Smith Jr. "There is no rush to brownfields yet," he said, adding that "they can be cleaned up, but it is a lot more complicated than buying land and getting permits."
But others say another factor that may cause developers to deal with the complications of using land in urban locations is the lack of suitable low-wage workers in the central New Jersey. "There is not a lot of labor available near 8A and 7A," said Daniel E. Frankel, a principal with Newmark & Company Real Estate. "And what housing is in the area is middle and upper income."
Mr. Frankel said goods in containers coming out of the port often need final assembly and tagging for delivery to retailers. He said these operations need employees willing to work for slightly over minimum wage, a description of recent immigrants with limited educations.
Hudson, Essex and Union Counties, the one closest to the seaport, have many recent immigrants, but the area has another problem, Mr. Frankel said. "There is not a lot of land near the port, and what there is usually has some kind of a problem, be it environmental, wetland or poor soils." He said that although it is technically possible to build on poor land, the cost of driving pilings down to bedrock to support buildings can make projects uneconomical.
Walking through the Lantis warehouse, Mr. Stern pointed to the vertical columns supporting the roof and noted that there is a piling directly under each one.
Indeed, with the current rules against filling in wetlands, some real estate executives say it is unlikely that Giants Stadium in the Meadowlands could be built today.
Recent changes in laws on brownfields and availability of environmental insurance have made the redevelopment of old industrial sites and landfills more practical, said Jeffrey Freireich, a managing partner of the Kushner Companies, a privately owned builder of commercial and residential properties.
"Environmental insurance is a relatively new development and is not very well known in the development community," he said. The availability of insurance that limits a developer's risk and the clearer rules on what constitutes a cleanup are allowing his company to "rescue brownfields that had been abandoned to the taxpayer."
One such project is a 50-acre site on the waterfront in Perth Amboy that will be developed for commercial and residential purposes over the next eight years, Mr. Freireich said. The company is examining other brownfield sites in northern New Jersey for commercial and residential development.
Kushner's two million square feet of industrial space in the North Bergen area of Hudson County made it through the recession with scarcely a ripple, said Richard Staudtmauer, the company's vice chairman. "We stayed pretty much fully occupied throughout the period. It was down at 8A that there was weakness because the supply increased."
HE said the lack of industrial sites in the region created "tremendous barriers to entry, which we like." He said many distributors prefer locations close to New York to serve retailers in the city and appreciate proximity to the George Washington Bridge for longer shipments.
Although many warehouse and distribution center developers emphasize access to the seaport, some investors say links to Newark International Airport are also important. The J. G. Petrucci Company, a private builder-developer in Hunterdon County, recently entered the north Jersey industrial market with the purchase of a 197,000-square-foot warehouse-distribution facility on 19 acres in Hillside.
"Most people think in terms of how far to the north or south of the airport they are," said Robert C. Kossar, the director of acquisitions and leasing for the company. "We decided to look to the west, and we are three and a half miles west of the airport."
Although the amount of air cargo has been reduced because of the slow economy, he said, shipments should return to previous levels in a few years. He added that the Hillside location was a good one to handle air freight. The acreage at the Hillside site would permit expanding the existing building by about 100,000 square feet.
For Hartz Mountain Industries, the two most recent warehouses have filled the Harmon Cove development in Secaucus. But Mr. Stern has other properties available for development, including a site for a 500,000-square-foot building near Exit 15W of the Turnpike in Kearny, once a factory town. Instead of a conventional warehouse, where the goods are in residence for a period of days or weeks, he is considering building what is known as a "cross-dock facility."
"It's more like a truck stop than a warehouse," he said. "It is a Federal Express type of operation; everything is in and out within three hours." Naturally, that means lots of trucks coming and going at all hours, something some towns might dislike.
"Kearny welcomes this stuff," Mr. Stern said.

Behind Some Stucco-Like Walls, Problems

BYLINE:  By JOHN SULLIVAN 

DATELINE: BRIDGEWATER 

 BODY:
WHEN Gary and Pamela Cohen bought their four-bedroom colonial-style house in the Tamaron Woods development seven years ago, they loved the ornate stucco facade, which seemed to fit perfectly with the neighborhood.
 But what Mr. Cohen did not know was that hidden within the smooth tan walls was an oozing layer of moisture and mold that had crept behind the siding and had eaten into the sides and underpinnings. 
 "We had to tear the front of our house off," said Mr. Cohen, who is a vice president for sales at a food company in Somerset County, "There was significant damage." 
Nor did Mr. Cohen know that he was not the only one with the same problem. Like countless homes built in New Jersey in the past decade -- and tens of thousands nationwide -- Mr. Cohen's house was coated with an artificial stucco that was sprayed on because it was cheaper and easier to apply than traditional stucco. The material, known as EIFS, for exterior insulation and finish system, was developed in Europe in the 1940's and became popular in the United States because it was an excellent insulator and almost completely waterproof.
But as Mr. Cohen found out, that can be a problem. When the the material is installed, it must be completely sealed. Otherwise, water finds its way behind the siding and often cannot drain or dry. As a result, the trapped moisture can eat away at wooden studs and wall sheathing.
Problems resulting from the use of EIFS (pronounced eefs siding grew into a cottage industry in the late 1990's as homeowners -- primarily in Southern states because of the warm, wet weather -- began to discover the rampant damage. Don Brenner, a lawyer in Princeton who represents Mr. Cohen, says he has filed suit on behalf of nearly 600 homeowners over the past three years.
"We have had cases where the damage is tremendous," Mr. Brenner said. "Rotting, all kinds of mold."
In Mr. Cohen's case, much of the sheathing -- coated with a thick black mold and rotted out -- had to be replaced, costing him about $30,000.
"The sheathing was ruined," he said. "It crumbled when they pulled it off in spots."
Mr. Cohen still keeps a videotape of the the removal, and even has a mold-encrusted section of the wall in his garage as evidence in his lawsuit against the builder, Pizzo & Pizzo, in and the Sto Corporation, based in Georgia, which he claims manufactured the EIFS used on his house.
Officials at Pizzo & Pizzo did not return repeated telephone calls. But in legal papers responding to Mr. Cohen's suit in Somerset County Superior Court, the company denied any negligence in the construction of Mr. Cohen's house.
In the past few months, legal advertisements have appeared in newspapers throughout New Jersey concerning a proposed national settlement involving the country's largest manufacturer of EIFS, Dryvit Systems, based in West Warwick, R.I., which has supplied about 50 percent of the material used in residential construction in the United States, according to lawyers involved in the settlement.
A $40 million settlement, which was proposed in response to class-action lawsuits filed in Tennessee, Illinois and Alabama, will be binding nationwide if it is approved at a final conference scheduled for Oct. 1.
Gary E. Mason, a lawyer representing the homeowners in the suit, said that according to the terms of the proposed settlement, Dryvit has offered to pay for half of the cost of repairs for anyone whose home has the stucco material. In addition, Mr. Mason said an independent company selected to make the repairs would guarantee the work.
Despite the litany of woes, W. Andrew Copenhaver, a lawyer for Dryvit in Washington, said the company still believed the product worked well.
"We are not admitting liability," Mr. Copenhaver said, "but it is time to put this litigation behind us and move on."
So far, Mr. Mason said, about 10,000 homneowners have downloaded application forms from the settlement's Web site -- stuccosettlement.com -- of which some 1,000 have applied for the settlement. He said that he did not know how many of the applicants owned homes in New Jersey.
"The settlement takes the approach that in most cases this can be repaired economically," Mr. Mason said. "We have an independent company, not associated with Dryvit, that is willing to warrant the success of its repairs."
Mr. Mason, who has represented several hundred clients in EIFS-related suits, said that the cases could be difficult to win because the problems related to the material are often connected to construction errors and that homeowners often did not know who built their house. Some homeowners discover the problems years after the legal time limit for lawsuits has expired (in New Jersey, suits must be filed within 10 years after construction is completed). And even for homeowners with cases that can seemingly be won, the cost of the suit can eat into any settlement.
People with strong cases "probably should not be in the settlement," Mr. Mason said. "But not every homeowner can get a good attorney, and not every homeowner has a good case."
Mr. Brenner, the lawyer in Princeton representing Mr. Cohen and others, who has been advising his clients not to accept the settlement in the class-action suit, said the problem was that repairs often left the EIFS siding on the house. "By allowing the stuff to remain," he said, "you guarantee heartache down the road."
His concern is echoed by many homeowners. For instance, Richard Strenkowski, an executive recruiter from Princeton, said he had to resurface about 80 percent of his house in Montgomery -- at a cost of $45,000 -- before he could sell it last year. Even after making the repairs, Mr. Strenkowski said, he could not sell his house for as much as neighboring homes.
"It was a mess," he said. "We decided to rip it all off and apply a real cement stucco."
Most property owners whose homes have a stucco facade probably cannot tell whether it is the traditional material or EIFS siding. Although experts say stucco is heavier and sounds like concrete when rapped with a fist, others say the only way to tell is to look at an existing hole in the siding, like an electrical outlet.
While stucco is a form of cement plastered on a metal frame, EIFS is usually sprayed onto mesh attached to Styrofoam boards. In the case of Dryvit, the EIFS was usually sprayed onto a blue mesh.
EIFS manufacturers have long contended that the material works as promised and that the problems stem from shoddy installation or poor maintenance, insisting that water can be trapped behind the siding if flashing is not properly installed or a window frame is not properly caulked.
"It is an effective moisture barrier if it is properly installed," said Bernard Allmayer, a spokesman for the EIFS Industry Members Association, a trade group. "If you don't have good construction practices, the problem is going to occur regardless of what material is used."
John Scialla, president of the Building Officers Association of New Jersey, generally agreed that the artificial stucco worked well if properly installed and maintained.
"From my experience, most of the problems seem to stem from the fact that it was not installed properly," said Mr. Scialla, who is the building inspector for the borough of Saddle River.
Other forms of siding, like clapboard or traditional stucco, allow some moisture penetration, but they also allow the water either to drain or to dry out. The original version of EIFS, on the other hand, is designed to be a perfect barrier, so when water enters it cannot leave. However, manufacturers of the material now also offer a drainable version, designed to eliminate problems in case of water penetration.
For its part, the National Association of Homebuilders has argued that even the best built homes will eventually leak and that homes built with EIFS can develop problems "even when properly constructed."
"Water is going to find a way in no matter how well the job is done," said David Jaffe, vice president for construction liability at the National Association of Homebuilders. "Over time, sealants crack."
Many homeowners are unaware that they should inspect all sealants -- particularly around exterior windows and doors -- every three years.
"If you don't make the joints water-tight, you have a problem," said Eric F. P. Burnett, director of the Pennsylvania Housing Research Center at Penn State University. 
Dr. Burnett said EIFS siding can work very well on homes, but it has to be properly installed and maintained. The job is often demanding because small leaks can cause big problems. "You need a good builder," he said.
But Mr. Cohen, like most homeowners, said that when he bought his house, he had never even heard there was a potential for problems with his siding.
He first tested for moisture in the walls after hearing similar stories from neighbors. "Fortunately, my wife and I were in the position to do something about it," he said. "We had set up a rainy day fund, and it didn't rain, it poured."

DATELINE: CORTLANDT MANOR 

 BODY:
THE pastoral scene was almost too perfect.
 Flocks of ewes and their spring lambs grazed on grassy hills, by summer already worn down to stubs by the sheep and the goats that share the pasture. Wayward geese were herded back to their place by a diligent farm dog. A chorus of clucking chickens competed with the squeals and satisfied grunts of feeding pigs. Rolling fields stretched into the distance, punctuated by picturesque farmhouses. 
 To walk these fields with John DeMaria, 69, the owner of Hemlock Hill Farm here, is to step back to a time worlds removed from the 8:05 a.m. commuter train that dominates many of his neighbors' lives. A working farm, a commonplace sight in upstate New York, seems somehow incongruous on a suburban road barely 10 minutes from the Taconic State Parkway, and the commercial shopping strips of Route 35 in Yorktown. 
Even at the county's less dense northern edges, the challenge of maintaining a farm in the midst of suburbia is one that keeps Mr. DeMaria scrambling. His father, Nicholas, bought the 116-acre property in 1939. 
Even as homeowners avidly seek addresses in newly developed residential enclaves whose names use the word farms to suggest the lifestyle of landed gentry, the working farms that once defined so much of Westchester have been disappearing.
"Westchester is an extreme example of something that is happening nationally, which is the disappearance of family farms at the edge of sprawl," said John Nolon, a law professor at Pace University School of Law and the director of the Land Use Law Center at Pace. 
It's not news that many family farms have succumbed to the economic pressures of development. Near Hemlock Hill Farm, for example, an undeveloped one-acre lot can sell for $170,000 to $250,000, according to Tom Santore, an associate broker for Century 21 Mulvey in Yorktown Heights.
Instead, it has become news when farmers tenaciously cling to their property.
"We've been approached by developers for the last 30 to 40 years," Mr. DeMaria said. "My mother and I have been pretty adamant about keeping it open space. There used to be lots of dairy farms around here."
(Of Mr. DeMaria's four daughters, only one, along with her husband, is actively involved in the farm's daily operations.)
Since 1983, the county's farmland has declined by 4,000 acres, a 25 percent shrinkage, with about 11,000 acres in Westchester remaining as farmland. And the majority of that is horse farms, rather than land dedicated to raising produce or livestock.
For someone who clings to a romantic fantasy of farming, the realities that govern Hemlock Hill Farm can be a rude awakening.
"The farm is our only source of income," said Mr. DeMaria, a 1954 graduate of the Cornell agricultural school. While he declined to provide any figures, he did discuss his efforts to negotiate financing for the operation, and the steps needed to generate income from wherever possible.
While the property had originally been a dairy farm, in the 1950's the focus shifted to meat production and animal husbandry.
Mr. DeMaria raises free-range chickens, ducks, geese, goats, pigs and some other animals, aiming its product at recently arrived immigrant groups who shun frozen meats or those cooks who prefer free-range poultry. The farm sells its meat to the public, both at a small store on the premises, as well as at the Peekskill Farmers' Market.
The DeMarias also raise some vegetables like tomatoes, peppers and lettuce, and herbs like basil and cilantro for self-picking, and sale at the Peekskill Farmers' Market. And, like other farms in the area, in the fall, they offer hay rides and pumpkin picking. Mr. DeMaria has even rented out some fields to local paint ball enthusiasts. 
His situation is not unusual.
"We looked around to see how to make the farm work," said Barbara Wilkens, the chairwoman of the Westchester Agricultural and Farmland Protection Board, and the owner of the 180-acre Wilkens Fruit and Fir Farm in Yorktown, which has been run by her family since 1915. "We have six children. Two of our daughters and their husbands now run the farm. It's a love of the land and the lifestyle."
Like many other county farms, Wilkens Farms is involved in what has come to be called agri-tourism, opening the farm to city dwellers and suburbanites eager to capture a hands-on experience. 
Throughout the year, the public can pay to pick their own fruits and vegetables, even Christmas trees, at Wilkens Farms. 
"Children don't know anything about where food comes from," Mrs. Wilkens said. "It's a matter of education. People actually like to see a working landscape."
Efforts to keep farmlands, if not under family ownership, then at least out of the hands of developers, have been a focus of county and regional efforts. In Southeast township in Putnam, the county has arranged to buy the 200-acre Tilly Foster Farms, a horse-breeding and dairy operation, to preserve as farmland and open space.
In Westchester, Gina D'Agrosa director of environmental planning for Westchester County's planning department, said: "The county is very interested in the preservation of farmland. In Westchester, the pressures are different. What's the value of the land, and the value of giving it up? 
"We're looking at initiatives that would help make it more profitable per acre for farmers to farm," she said. "There are possibilities like getting farmers connected to restaurants as a niche market."
There are those who think that solutions to preserve the county's farmland require other strategies as well.
"In the big picture, we haven't decided where we want development," Mr. Nolon said. "What we really haven't done in the New York metro area is make a connection between the high-quality restaurants we have, and the fact that we have nearby agriculture that citizens would like to see preserved. No one has put in a micro-economic solution that would involve farms, restaurants and citizens. Asking government to do it all is extreme."
Although few local farms remain, farming employs some 2,000 workers and generates nearly $230 million in sales. Horse farms alone represent a $121 million industry. 
Last year, the county began an Agricultural and Farmland Protection District, partly to identify properties and land that should be protected. Ms. D'Agrosa said future strategies could include the county's purchase of development rights to the farms.
Meanwhile, the DeMarias continue to do whatever it takes to keep Hemlock Hill Farm going as a viable concern.
"I'm amazed we're still here," said Christina Alvarez, the daughter of Mr. DeMaria who works on the farm.

 BODY:
Elizabeth Marie Menke and Keith Anthony Lord were married yesterday at St. Joseph's Roman Catholic Church in New York. The Rev. 
Owen Lafferty performed the ceremony.
 The bride and bridegroom are vice presidents for mergers and acquisitions at investment banks in New York, she at Rothschild and he at Lehman Brothers. 
 Ms. Menke, 33, is keeping her name. She is on the board of Greenwich House, a settlement house in New York. A graduate of Brown University, she received a master's degree in international studies and an M.B.A. from the University of Pennsylvania. She is a daughter of Judith Menke and Richard J. Menke of Prior Lake, Minn. Her father, who is retired, was a judge of the Minnesota District Court in Shakopee. Her mother, also retired, was a nurse at Abbott Northwestern Hospital in Minneapolis.
Mr. Lord, 36, graduated from the London School of Economics and received an M.B.A. from Columbia.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
When the Fed Shifts Rates, Is It Telling Its Secrets?

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
DOES the Federal Reserve Board know things about the economy that the rest of us don't? When the Fed's path for short-term interest rates switches direction, as some pundits thought it might last week, many investors see a signal as well as a change in the cost of credit. And when the Fed revises its view of the risks in the economy, investors may think they've learned something useful. But have they?
 The two questions have different answers. The Fed may know things that investors don't, but its policy changes generally don't convey much of that information. 
 From a look at its staff, one might expect the Fed to have an advantage in taking the pulse of the economy. The Fed employs 210 professional economists at its headquarters in Washington, and an additional 275 at its 12 regional banks. On the boards of those 12 banks and 25 additional branches are 281 more people whose part-time job is to think about the shifting fortunes of businesses and consumers. Many more people outside the Fed also follow the economy, of course, but it's unclear whether they exchange information as easily through the market as the Fed can within its own organization.
Christina D. Romer and David H. Romer, a husband-and-wife team of economists at the University of California at Berkeley, tried to measure whether the Fed's internal forecasts for gross national product and inflation were more accurate than those of private-sector prognosticators. Their results, published two years ago, suggest that "commercial forecasters would find it nearly optimal to discard their forecasts and adopt the Federal Reserve's." That is, the private-sector forecasts offer almost no useful information once one has access to the Fed's internal forecasts.
This summer, a new study has surfaced that suggests the Fed's policy moves do not necessarily reflect its advantage in forecasting.
In that study, three of the Fed's own economists -- Jon Faust, Eric T. Swanson and Jonathan H. Wright -- made this observation: The Fed often sets interest rates before a report on some aspect of the economy becomes public, but after the period covered by that report has elapsed. The three researchers asked whether knowing the Fed's action in advance could add any predictive power to commercial forecasts of what the report would say.
For example, the Fed left interest rates unchanged last Tuesday. On Friday, the Labor Department released its report on consumer price inflation for July. Could commercial forecasts of July inflation have been improved by knowing that the Fed would stand pat?
After looking at data from 1989 to 2001, the researchers answered "no" for two kinds of consumer price inflation. The answer was also "no" for three other inflation measures, as well as for nonfarm payrolls, real gross domestic product and retail sales. The only forecasts that the Fed's interest-rate moves could have helped were for industrial production. And guess what? Industrial production is the only one of those nine indicators that is calculated by the Fed.
Mr. Faust pointed out that the Fed had many other ways to convey information -- through its regular publications, for example, or speeches by its governors. Yet professionals still take notice when the Fed's actions surprise the markets. A significant share of investors expected the Fed to cut interest rates on Tuesday. Their disappointment probably made them more likely to sell stocks, and the markets declined.
SO a few questions remain. First, were all those disappointed folks just worried about industrial production? Perhaps, but it's more likely they were thinking more about the long-term health of the economy than just the next set of numbers to come over the transom. The study by the three Fed economists looked only at short-term forecasting -- not the long-term implications of the Fed's actions and its statements on the economic outlook. On Tuesday, the Fed decided the economy was more likely to weaken than to gain strength. 
Next, is the Fed failing to incorporate all the useful information in its internal forecasts when it fiddles with short-term interest rates? Again, probably not. The Romers found that the Fed's superior information about inflation pertained less to the current quarter than to the next four quarters. So it's not too surprising that the Fed's monetary policy moves reveal little about soon-to-be released statistics on inflation in the recent past.
And where does the Fed's advantage come from? For one thing, the Fed has proprietary information about banks. In addition, the reserve banks' research teams keep tabs on all sorts of businesses, said David Skidmore, a Fed spokesman. Besides the tracking of statistics, he added, "there are other things that are more akin to a reporter working a beat." What a strange idea!

HEADLINE: WEDDINGS; 
Lori Khatchadourian, Charles King

 BODY:
Lori Khatchadourian, the daughter of Jean and Puzant H. Khatchadourian of New York, was married yesterday to Prof. Charles Eldon King, the son of Karleen A. King of Springdale, Ark., and the late Jackie S. King. The Rev. Mardiros Chevian performed the ceremony at St. Vartan Armenian Cathedral in New York. 
 Ms. Khatchadourian, 27, is keeping her name. She was until May a program officer in Washington at the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, helping to monitor elections and working with civic organizations in Russia, Georgia, Ukraine and Armenia. Next month, she is to become a doctoral student in classical archaeology at the University of Michigan. 
 The bride graduated summa cum laude from Georgetown and received a master's degree in Russian and post-Soviet studies from the London School of Economics. Her father is the president of Jaguar Casting, a jewelry manufacturer in New York, and her mother is its office manager.
Professor King, 34, is an associate professor of political science at Georgetown and writes on developments in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. He graduated summa cum laude from the University of Arkansas and received a master's degree in Russian and East European studies and a doctorate in politics from Oxford, where he was a Marshall scholar. 
The bridegroom's mother retired as a cook at Central Junior High School in Springdale, and his father was a machinist there for the Ball Corporation, the canning jar manufacturer. 
Ms. Khatchadourian was in her senior year at Georgetown in the fall of 1996, when she took a class on the Balkans taught by Professor King. She remembered staying after class to talk to him because she had learned that he did his graduate studies in England, and she was then considering the London School of Economics. He strongly encouraged her to pursue a degree there. 
"I did think he was good-looking," she added.
Two years later, after Ms. Khatchadourian completed her degree in London and returned home, she called Professor King to ask for a job recommendation. They didn't talk again until months later, after she saw him on CNN, talking about the Kosovo crisis. 
"I was reminded of how cute I thought he was," she said, "and thought I should get in touch with him to thank him for the references, and to let him know it worked out."
She sent him a "thank you" e-mail message and asked if he'd be available for coffee sometime. With the awkwardness of the student-teacher situation at Georgetown behind them, he responded promptly, scolding her for continuing to call him Professor King and suggesting dinner rather than coffee.
"Clearly, in the back of my mind, I was certainly interested in her," he said, acknowledging that he had once told a friend about the "gorgeous, magnificent, absolutely fantastic" student he had met. "And now there was an opportunity because the stars were sort of aligned in a way they weren't before."

Where Rockets' Red Glare Reflects Hard Times

BYLINE:  By BERNARD SIMON 

 BODY:
NO matter how perfect the weather at Cape Canaveral this Wednesday, a dark cloud will be hanging over the maiden launching of America's newest rocket.
 Hundreds of workers from the Lockheed Martin Corporation and their military and civilian guests are sure to cheer loudly as the rocket, the Atlas V, thunders into space to put a French-built broadcast satellite into orbit 22,300 miles above Earth. But the applause and the celebratory dinner that will follow a successful launching cannot hide the pain of the world's space industry. 
 With many rockets competing for fewer payloads in recent years, launch companies around the world have been cutting prices. The economic slowdown in the United States and severe problems in the telecommunications industry have contributed to the weakened demand. 
The Pentagon has directed Lt. Gen. Brian Arnold, commander of the Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center in Los Angeles, to find ways to alleviate financial pressures on the two companies that dominate American space launchings, Lockheed Martin, the lead contractor for the Atlas V, and the Boeing Company.
Boeing's new Delta IV rocket is scheduled to make its first flight on Oct. 9. The Delta IV, similar to the Atlas V, will be carrying a French commercial satellite.
Rocket industry officials say Lockheed Martin and Boeing are each seeking about $100 million in government aid to offset the downturn in business. No decisions have been made, but a Pentagon official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, indicated that the companies would get at least some help. The official attributed that likelihood to the military's heightened alert after Sept. 11, which had made it "more critical than ever to be able to launch our national security payloads when we want to."
"There are some things we're going to have to do to ensure that we have two suppliers, and not one," the official said.
The Atlas V and Delta IV programs have received $500 million each from the Air Force, a big customer. But much has changed in the eight years since work began on these rockets, part of a new series known as Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicles, which are intended to be less expensive but more reliable and flexible than their predecessors.
Frost & Sullivan, an industrial research group in San Jose, Calif., concluded in a report in May that the world market for satellite launching services has "too many vehicles trying to survive off too few launch opportunities."
Only 60 satellites were launched worldwide last year, the fewest since 1962. An average of 90 launchings a year took place in the mid-90's, and there were 85 in 2000. According to Marco Caceres, senior space analyst at the Teal Group, an aerospace consulting firm based in Fairfax, Va., only 15 launchings last year were commercial; 28 were for government civilian agencies, including NASA and the European, Chinese and Russian space agencies; and the remaining 17 were military. Mr. Caceres said he expected about 75 launchings this year.
EXPERTS inside and outside the industry are nearly unanimous that it cannot survive long in its present form.
"There's too much capacity in the launch market today," said Bernard L. Schwartz, chief executive of Loral Space and Communications of New York, a satellite manufacturer. "There's going to have to be some consolidation."
Mark J. Albrecht, president of International Launch Services in McLean, Va., a joint venture between Lockheed Martin and the Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center of Russia, said: "This is a business where volume matters. We're all interested in keeping our tempo up." But, he said, "you can't price below cost for very long."
Out of the 18 rocket-launching companies, the most intense rivalry is among Boeing, International Launch Services and the European group Arianespace. These three have the biggest and most reliable rockets and a combined 90 percent of the market for medium and heavy satellites. Of 33 launchings in those categories last year, International Launch Services had 13, Boeing 9 and Arianespace 8, Frost & Sullivan said. Twelve were commercial, and Arianespace did half of them.
Besides the Delta IV program, Boeing has 40 percent of the Sea Launch Company, which uses a Ukrainian-built rocket to put satellites into orbit from a converted oil-drilling platform in the Pacific Ocean. International Launch Services markets Lockheed's Atlas rockets and the Russian-made Proton, using access to both in its pitch. The new Atlas V is powered by a Russian engine.
The new Delta and Atlas rockets give Boeing and Lockheed Martin the ability to match Arianespace's Ariane 5, which has grabbed business since its 1999 introduction because it can carry two satellites and a payload up to 14,000 pounds. Older American rockets could not carry more than one satellite or 8,500 pounds.
Describing Arianespace as the "Mercedes-Benz of the launch industry," Philip McAlister, a director of the Futron Corporation, a technology consulting firm in Bethesda, Md., said the Europeans had been "kicking the Americans' butts."
Ferocious competition has led to a wave of price-cutting. Mr. McAlister estimated that the price of launching a satellite, which can range from $50 million to $100 million depending on size, had fallen 30 percent in the last two years.
Customers no longer sign launch contracts years in advance. "They're waiting till nine months before launch," he said.
Another consultant, who asked not to be identified, estimated that Boeing and Lockheed Martin had cut payload launching prices for the first flights of their rockets by more than 50 percent and that Boeing would forgo payment entirely if its mission was not successful. Lockheed Martin declined to disclose prices. Wilbur C. Trafton, president of Boeing's launching services unit, said only: "Customers have received what I would call a special deal. It's not our intention to stay at these levels beyond the first launch." 
When the Atlas V and Delta IV programs were conceived in the mid-1990's, the Air Force was talking of a "launch on demand" capability for military and spy satellites.
Prospects looked even better on the commercial side, where start-ups, including Iridium, Globalstar and Teledesic, were planning the equivalent of vast telecommunications networks in space. Teledesic, started in 1990 by the cable and telecommunications entrepreneur Craig O. McCaw, had planned 840 satellites, costing $9 billion.
Today the Air Force's launch-on-demand vision is still just that. The dreams of Mr. McCaw and others are unrealized. Teledesic, for instance, has scaled back its plans to 30 satellites, none yet launched. Globalstar, which has 48 satellites in orbit, filed for bankruptcy protection in February. Iridium emerged from bankruptcy in 2000 in scaled-down form.
EVEN established satellite operators have cut back. Financing is harder to arrange, and insurance rates have soared because of satellite failures and the higher risk of new rockets, which are not yet proven reliable. Also expected to dampen demand are mergers and takeovers among satellite companies -- like the deal last year between SES Astra and GE Americom to create SES Global, which operates 29 satellites. Combined companies eliminate duplication and cut costs.
Worse for the industry, technology has extended the life of a typical satellite to 18 years or more, from 12 to 15 years in the 1980's and 90's, lengthening the time between launchings. Referring to Air Force plans, the Pentagon official said that launchings planned for 2006 had been delayed.
The outlook is not all bleak. "It's a cyclical industry," said Juliette Salvati, program leader of the satellite communications division at Frost & Sullivan. "A few lean years do not mean that the industry is dying."
Though global mobile phone and "Internet in the sky" services remain visions, more established satellite uses, including direct-to-home TV, are relatively stable. "Consumer demand for our services is still strong," said Richard DalBello, executive director of the Satellite Industry Association, a trade group. 
In any case, satellites have become an essential part of communication. "You can't just switch them off and walk away," said Roger Tinley, vice president for space systems at Telesat Canada, which buys space on a rocket for its satellites every 18 months and is building two satellites.
Mr. Schwartz, the Loral chief executive, estimated that 15 to 25 satellites need to be replaced each year as they reach the end of their useful lives and are placed into "parking" orbits or fall back to Earth. Describing replenishment as an "irrefutable law of physics," he said that "the industry has been putting off those decisions, but there's a time when they can no longer be put off."

Trim Stocks? Sure, but Don't Leave The Game

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
WITH all the volatility in the stock market these days, investors may not feel very comfortable. 
 In a conversation last week, William E. Rhodes, chief investment strategist at Rhodes Analytics in Boston, gave his hints on what to do. Following are excerpts: 

Q. What approach should an investor take when the economic outlook is so uncertain?

A. Investors should already be in bonds and cash. The lower bond yields go, the more compelling equities look. But we are not yet to the point where that valuation is very strong. In fact, fixed income on a valuation basis is still somewhat more attractive than stocks.

Q. So should you be out of stocks now?

A. You should have a lower weight in stocks, around 35 or 40 percent, compared to a normal allocation of 60 percent. Investors should never be completely out of stocks. That is risky because you can miss important rallies. Once you get down to a 20 or 25 percent portfolio weighting of stocks, you are getting pretty low.

Q. When should investors start increasing their exposure to stocks, and what should they buy?

A. When you get to the point that you are really aggressively increasing your exposure to stocks, you have to see what the market looks like. It is impossible to say what it is going to look like ahead of time.
The best sectors right now are probably consumer staples and materials, although materials have decayed a little bit. For instance, we wouldn't want to buy an aluminum stock now. Health care is showing a bit more improvement. It could be a little iffy for some of the industries in there like pharmaceuticals. And biotech is still a little rough. But we like health care and H.M.O.'s, including WellPoint Health Networks. In materials we like specialty chemicals like Sigma-Aldrich. Gold stocks have had a great run but they look like they are a little tired here. I don't think I would try to pick up a gold stock now. But if we get a downdraft in the stock market, those stocks will start to come back.
In consumer staples, we look at something like Sysco, a food distributor. In industrials we would favor aerospace and defense, which looks like it is going to have a long run, probably for the next four or five years as the United States re-arms. We like Lockheed Martin.
It probably is a little early for most people to be jumping into technology stocks. It's certainly too early to be jumping into telecommunications stocks. And it is probably a little early to be jumping into utilities.

Q. Some people think that growth is weakening enough to force the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. Others think that this weakening is a temporary slowdown. If investors are betting on either of these views, what should they be doing in the market?

A. If you think that this is a temporary air pocket and you also happen to believe that the Fed is going to give you another interest rate cut, one thing you could do is look at bank stocks. We are talking about real banks here, not banks that own brokerage firms or banks that have insurance companies, but banks in the traditional sense. One possibility is Golden West Financial. The only problem with bank stocks is that the spreads that banks are getting are starting to drop; the rate at which they can reinvest is coming down, whereas the cost of their deposits is not coming down as fast.
If you think that this is going to be a longer-run thing, then I think, again, the consumer staples and the health care stocks are something you could look at.

Q. What signals will tell you to increase your exposure to stocks?

A. Two things, really, and they go to the heart of the stock market problems right now. The first is the P/E, the price-earnings ratio, which is historically very high at almost 33. From 1870 until the 1990's, the P/E ratio only rose above 21 or 22 on a sustainable basis one time and that was in the 1930's when earnings were just a disaster.
The other is the dividend yield. Before the 1990's, dividend yields never dropped on a sustainable basis below 3 percent. They are 1.67 percent now. So what you are really looking for is a rise in dividends and a drop in the P/E.

Q. Does this mean that investors with 35 or 40 percent of their portfolios in equities should stay there for now?

A. As long as they are not in stocks that are likely to deteriorate, yes. But the most important thing for people to do is to put stops underneath their trades. Every time you make a trade, put a stop loss order under it. You should tell your broker, on a permanent basis, if the stock drops 15 or 20 percent, just sell. That will stop a lot of the disasters that take place in portfolios. This is one part of the investment business that a lot of people, whether they are institutional or individual investors, tend to neglect.

Ways to Move Up When the Economy Moves Down

BYLINE:  By KAREN ALEXANDER 

 BODY:
KAREN NORRIS might be considered luckier than most employees at the Oracle Corporation. Not only has she managed to keep her job -- the company has cut several hundred positions over the last year -- but she has proved that it is still possible to advance her career.
 Mrs. Norris, who joined Oracle four years ago, was recently promoted for a third time, to director of global strategies for Oracle's pricing and licensing unit. With the new position comes new responsibilities and more prestige, though no extra pay for now. The company, still reeling from an industrywide slowdown, has frozen salaries and stopped most bonuses, in addition to trimming its work force. 
 But Mrs. Norris sees that as only temporary. She said she accepted the promotion last September to improve her skills and to position herself for further advancement. Money, she says, will come later. 
"It would never enter my mind to say, 'Well, don't promote me and I'll just hang out.' It's an impossibility," said Mrs. Norris, 36, of Oakland, Calif. 
Even though times are tough, with more than 2.5 million jobs eliminated nationwide over the last 18 months, management and career experts say the surviving workers can still stand out and make a difference in their companies. Some employees seem to be doing just that.
"This is the best time, when everyone else is scared, to be remarkable," said Seth Godin, author of "Survival Is Not Enough" (Free Press, 2002). "The times when great fortunes are made and great businesses are made are these times, when companies are in the doldrums."
Mrs. Norris's boss, Jacqueline D. Woods, vice president for global practices, agrees.
"Companies are looking for new ways to grow or new ways to become more efficient," she said. "If the way that I was doing something had really worked for the past few years and now it isn't working anymore, clearly I'm more open to examining that new idea.
"When things are going great, that's when people are less open to new ideas because they're less open to change," she added.
Stephen M. Shapiro, author of "24/7 Innovation: A Blueprint for Surviving and Thriving in an Age of Change" (McGraw-Hill, 2001), said that workers looking to move ahead should try to differentiate themselves, making sure that those in the position to promote take notice. Sometimes, he added, that may mean taking on new responsibilities without any immediate financial reward.
"You don't want to become a noisemaker for the sake of doing it," he said, "but you do want to look for ways that you can make a difference in the company that no one else is doing."
In Mrs. Norris's case, it was the way she managed an internal Web site that caught her bosses' attention. Under her supervision, the site had become a repository for all of Oracle's pricing and licensing information.
"People talk about it as being the single source of truth for our policies," Ms. Woods said. She said she also liked the fact that Mrs. Norris acted as a team player, trying to help others in the company.
Since then, Mrs. Norris has begun what she calls an "internal road show," making presentations to various departments to explain how pricing and licensing decisions are made. With customers scrutinizing deals more carefully, she said, she thought it would be helpful if others at Oracle understood pricing policies and discussed them with clients. "People are a little bit more edgy," she said. "We have the salespeople calling us; they're looking for an explanation on why the prices are the way they are."
Large companies, though, aren't the only places where innovation and versatility can pay off.
"In a small business, workers definitely have to be more versatile than they were in the past; with fewer employees, people have to wear lots of different hats," said Lloyd Graff, president of Graff, Pinkert & Company in Oak Forest, Ill., which buys, sells and refurbishes equipment for the precision-machinery industry. 
Mr. Graff says that his company has responded to a slowdown in manufacturing by expanding into the information and services business. In addition to handling machinery, Graff, Pinkert now offers industrywide seminars, and in early 2001 started a trade magazine called Screw Machine World.
Mr. Graff says his employees have been asked to work in both sectors, in some cases on both machinery and magazines on the same day. The employees who will succeed, he says, are those who do not cling to old notions of their jobs. "One of the important things at any job is to buy into the culture of the company," he said, "particularly if the culture of the business is one of change and adaptation."
Jill Sevelow, 43, of Homewood, Ill., appears to have done that successfully. She was hired as a secretary at Graff, Pinkert six years ago, and her jobs have since included selling spare parts for machine tools, organizing the company's educational seminars and selling ads for the magazine. In January, she was promoted to managing editor of Screw Machine World, though in a pinch she will still answer the phone, take an order for spare machine parts and send it to the customer. "Then she'll swing back and help me edit a story I'm working on right now," Mr. Graff said. 
Although she took on many additional responsibilities, Ms. Sevelow was not always rewarded with a pay increase. (Raises and bonuses are determined by how well the company is doing. As the economy slowed, so did Ms. Sevelow's bonuses, although she did receive a raise recently.)
Though promotions may come without pay increases, many companies with relatively little cash are trying to motivate employees in new ways, according to John Challenger, chief executive of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, the job placement firm in Chicago. "Much the way the dot-coms gave out stock options because they didn't have a lot of money, companies have fought to try to create other kinds of incentives," he said.
Such rewards may include increased vacation time, greater autonomy, the ability to work from home, a better title or more flexible hours, he said. "There's extraordinary opportunity for advancement."
MR. GODIN, the author, says the workplace environment can resemble biological evolution. In the short term, the secret to survival may mean keeping a low profile, hoping that no one notices you when deciding whom to fire, he said, but in nature, the failure to adapt is a long-term prescription for doom. 
"The way evolution works in nature is through frequent, nonfatal, incremental change," Mr. Godin said. "You want to figure out how you can make a tiny change to a tiny portion of the people you serve and see if it serves you better" -- but not enough of a change to cost you a job if it doesn't work out, he added.
During speaking engagements, Mr. Godin says he is often asked how a boss can be persuaded to let an employee try something new. 
"What you're really saying is you want your boss to accept responsibility if you fail, and that's never going to happen," he said. "So you have to figure out how to do this under the radar, how to make this change small enough that you don't have to ask your boss."
Mr. Godin suggests, for example, trying a new approach on just 3 percent of customers at first. "Of course, if it works, your boss will allow you to do it with the other 97 percent of your customers," he said.

HEADLINE: On Wall Street After Dark, A New Bohemia Beckons 

BYLINE:  By JULIA CHAPLIN 

 BODY:
AT 1 a.m. on a recent Saturday, the area around ground zero in Lower Manhattan appeared deserted except for a crew from Con Edison. But on a side street, among the vacancy signs and garbage bags, throngs of young people dressed in retro rock T-shirts crowded the entrance to the John Street Bar and Grill.
 Gideon Yago, 24, an MTV News reporter who was serving as D.J. that evening, lugged his records past several Vespas and locked bicycles. The bouncer let him pass without paying the $1 cover charge. 
 Two women, who seemed accustomed to having velvet ropes part for them, were waiting patiently nearby. "That's so punk rock that there's no guest list," one said. 
In the last few months, young people usually seen cruising the thrift shops of the Lower East Side and Williamsburg, Brooklyn, have been spending more time frolicking on the nearly vacant streets of the financial district after dark. They've taken over bars that are eager to gin up business, which has nearly vanished since Sept. 11, and some spaces with below-market rents are being leased for new nightclubs and art galleries that cater to this set. 
"When those kids approached me to do a rock 'n' roll party, I thought, 'This isn't going to work,' " said Dave Sheeran, the owner of the John Street Bar, which usually caters to the Wall Street corporate crowd. Mr. Sheeran said his business almost died, what with the dot-com crash, the destruction of the twin towers and recent corporate layoffs. 
But since the Friday-night party -- known as Drunk Love -- began in June, the bar has been packed every week. It has drawn the likes of Kelly Osbourne; the young fashion designer Zac Posen; Moby; Drea De Matteo, an actress on "The Sopranos"; and members of the Strokes. 
Thus an age-old New York phenomenon repeats itself: hipsters spot an underused, slightly menacing neighborhood and move in. Just as artists colonized the empty factories of SoHo in the 1970's, then the drug-ridden tenements of the East Village in the 1980's, a trickle of young bohemians are now finding their way after dark to the financial district, where the post-Sept. 11 exodus of businesses and some residents has left the neighborhood with an unlikely cachet of cool. 
"The East Village has turned into Wall Street, so now Wall Street is becoming like the East Village," Mr. Yago said. 
While there's long been a coterie of artists, musicians and writers living in the financial district -- including Richard Serra, Cheryl Dunn and members of Sonic Youth -- it has become emptier and more affordable since Sept. 11. Pamela Liebman, the chief executive of the Corcoran Group, says the residential rents in the financial district have fallen 25 percent to 30 percent, compared with 15 percent for the city as a whole.
Inside the John Street Bar, Shawn Regruto, 26, and Alex Burns, 24, two of the night's hosts, chatted up a group of girls in cheerleader miniskirts who were doing a new-wave pogo to Joy Division's "These Days." The wood-paneled walls were covered with mirrored beer logos and mounted moose heads. 
"It feels like the punk rock parties we went to when we were growing up," said Mr. Regruto, a photographer who designs T-shirts. "No one cares if you're throwing beer bottles against the wall or jumping up and down and screaming. It's such a relief."
Two years ago, Mr. Regruto promoted a hip-hop party at Lot 61, in Chelsea, with Richie Akiva, the co-owner of Butter, a restaurant in Greenwich Village. Lot 61 was popular with tabletop-dancing socialites like Nicky and Paris Hilton and rap stars like Jay-Z and Sean Combs. 
"Back then, over-the-top materialism seemed really interesting," Mr. Regruto said. "But now with the recession and terrorism, globe-trotting socialites and yachts seem so superficial. This party is a reaction to that glossy lifestyle." 
Mr. Burns, an actor, recalled his days at chic clubs like Bungalow 8 in Chelsea. "It got to the point where I'd be sitting in a crowded booth in some V.I.P. area and feel totally alone. I'd just put on my Walkman and listen to Radiohead." 
Mr. Yago of MTV said that part of the appeal of parties like Drunk Love is the spontaneity. "During the economic boom it was really hard to foster any sort of creative community," he said. "Anyone who came up with a fresh idea tried to figure out a way to profit from it. It seemed like every art party was sponsored by Skyy vodka. Nothing had the intrinsic value of 'We're doing this 'cause it's fun.' "
For Mr. Yago and his friends, the area around ground zero seems to fit the gritty feel of much of the fashion and music that is brewing downtown right now from garage bands like the Liars, the Rapture and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs.
No one at these parties in the financial district would be caught carrying a Birkin bag or wearing Prada sneakers. What's more, Mr. Burns said, "anyone dressed obnoxiously, in a yuppie way" wouldn't even be allowed in.
Christiane Joy, 28, an East Village designer who makes clothes for her friends, and Karen O, the lead singer of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, showed up in what is considered proper attire: a dress made from a bed sheet and fabric from a mattress. "With all these executives getting hauled off to jail, people are leery of anything corporate," Ms. Joy said. "Charging $3,000 for a Versace dress seems deceitful. If people can feel the rough edges it feels a lot more honest. It's almost like a folk movement."
Jim Walrod, a design consultant for the Park restaurant in Chelsea and the Downtown L.A. Standard hotel in Los Angeles, said, "The East Village is happening, but it already has a legacy. Sometimes it takes a geographical switch to start a new scene." He plans to open a bar in the late fall one block below Chambers Street. It will cater to this homespun art movement. 
On a recent evening, Floria Sigismondi, 36, an artist who has directed videos for David Bowie and Marilyn Manson, was at the New York City Urban Experience Museum on South Street, a few blocks from the John Street Bar, for an art opening. "The energy here feels raw," she said. "It's kind of how I imagine SoHo or Chelsea when it first started."
Other underground clubs are creeping up. Taavo Somer, 29, an architect and T-shirt designer, started a Saturday-night social called Waxed last month with his friend Carlos Quirarte, 26, at a topless club two blocks from ground zero. (Mr. Somer would not allow the name or address to be printed for fear of "ruining its underground vibe.") 
"Historically, artists and young people who don't have a lot of money are like pathfinders," Mr. Somer said. "They go to edgy areas and start hanging out with friends. Then a gourmet coffee shop opens and soon it's gentrified."
It was midnight and Mr. Somer, with his grown-out surfer hair and one of his T-shirt designs that read "My girlfriend is out of town," pedaled up to the topless club with several other members of his low-rider bicycle gang, Trucker Tan. 
Jen Stillwell, 24, a talent scout at Island/Def Jam Music Group, pulled up with her bicycle gang, Lady Generals. The five members sported red trucker hats, worn slightly to the side. The "on sale" price tags were still hanging off as accessories. Ms. Stillwell said she saw the bicycle gangs as "sort of like freedom fighters." 
Each week, the Lady Generals and Trucker Tan ride around and distribute party fliers printed on mechanic-shop rags or pages from pornographic magazines. Mr. Somer said the topless bar he uses for Waxed had been closed on Saturdays since 9/11 because business had been so bad. 
But now, at 2 a.m., people were drifting up and down the bar's three floors. On the main level the dancers ground to the latest hip-hop. Upstairs, a D.J. was spinning the White Stripes on a turntable set up in a former sushi bar. People lounged on sleazy-looking leather couches and La-Z-Boy-type chairs. As a campy touch, Mr. Somer had placed bowls of Cheetos and pretzels around the room.
"Every week we come back and there's more strange decorations," Mr. Somer said. "We keep telling the owner to chill out." 
Renata Martins, 23, a Brazilian fashion model who has appeared in campaigns for Tommy Hilfiger and Gap, was grooving on the makeshift dance floor to David Bowie's "Rebel Rebel." She moved from Williamsburg to John Street last spring. "Williamsburg lost its edge," she said, noting a topless dancer in the corner snaking on slabs of sliced ham. "It's edgy here."
Downstairs, in the main room, another dancer, Veronica Kitty, was warming up before going onstage. She straightened out her transparent floor-length mesh dress. "Saturday nights are O.K.," she shrugged. "But these rocker kids don't tip very well."

Risks Are Rising in Bonds, Too

BYLINE:  By VIRGINIA MUNGER KAHN 

 BODY:
INVESTORS who have sought a refuge from stocks by pouring money into bond funds may need to prepare for a storm, say some bond managers, who worry about the prospects for intermediate and long-term bonds.
 Short-term and long-term interest rates have already dropped to their lowest levels in decades. And last week, amid signs that the economy may be stalling, the Federal Reserve indicated that it was prepared to cut short-term rates further. While longer-term rates could keep dropping, too, there is a good chance that they are already near a bottom, several analysts said. 
 Because interest rates and bond prices move in opposite directions, rising interest rates would lower the prices of bonds. And because bonds of longer maturity are more sensitive to interest rate moves, long-term bonds would fall the most. 
"I think buying high-quality, long-term bonds today is extremely risky," said Robert L. Rodriguez, manager of the FPA New Income fund in Los Angeles. He also said investors should think carefully before buying intermediate-term bonds. Long-term bonds generally have a a maturity of 10 years or more, while intermediate-term bonds have a maturity of 4 to 10 years.
Similarly, Scott F. Richard, head of the investment-grade bond team at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, said: "We believe now is not the time to add to an intermediate- or long-term bond position. If you're going to leave the stock market and you're after a safe haven, our view is this is a good time for short-term bonds."
Even if short-term rates are cut further by the Fed, intermediate- and long-term rates would not necessarily follow, because the central bank has no direct control of longer rates. And if financial markets expect the economy to expand rapidly -- because of Fed action or any other reason -- intermediate- and long-term rates would move higher. 
Based on the 4.09 percent yield on a 10-year Treasury note on Tuesday, an investor would lose 1.73 percent of his capital over the next six months if interest rates rose by just one-half of 1 percent, Mr. Rodriguez said. Interest rates are now so low that even a tiny drop in the price of a bond can eliminate a bond fund's return, he said. "You just don't have any coupon to protect you," Mr. Rodriguez said.
The decline in interest rates over the last few years led to a bond market rally. And as the stock market has struggled recently, investors have poured money into bond funds, adding $88 billion last year alone, according to the Investment Company Institute. So far this year, they have put in an additional $58.5 billion. Taxable bond funds are up 2.1 percent, on average, this year through Thursday, while domestic stock funds are down 19.1 percent. 
At the end of July, the Pimco Total Return bond fund, which has returned 5.3 percent this year through Thursday, had $60 billion in assets, making it the second-largest mutual fund, ahead of Fidelity Magellan, at $59.9 billion. The biggest is still Vanguard 500 Index, which tracks the Standard & Poor's 500 and has $70 billion.
THE bond rally may not be entirely over, but Mr. Rodriguez says the current low yields have led to significant risks for intermediate and long-term securities. He cited a growing federal budget deficit, which tends to drive up interest rates, and a faltering dollar, which may hurt foreign demand for American securities. 
Not all bond managers share his concerns, but Mr. Rodriguez has a strong track record. His fund has outperformed 97 percent of its peers in intermediate-term bond funds over the last 10 years, according to Morningstar Inc. In the horrendous bond market of 1994, it was one of only three intermediate-term bond funds that managed to avoid losing money, said Alan Papier, a mutual fund analyst at Morningstar.
Mr. Richard contends that intermediate- and long-term bond prices reflect an overly pessimistic view about the Federal Reserve's ability to get the economy moving again. 
"The market has built in a very anemic recovery, which in essence is saying the Fed will not be effective," he said. "We think that's incorrect. Intermediate- and long-term rates are likely to rise."
Managers at Pimco share some of these concerns. Mark Kiesel, an executive vice president at the company, said that only a small upward move in rates would be needed to offset the slim yields on intermediate-term Treasuries. Two-year Treasuries currently yield about 2.25 percent, while five-year Treasuries yield 3.42 percent. Pimco has kept the duration of its intermediate-term bond portfolios in line with the Lehman Aggregate Bond Index, at 3.9 years. Duration is a measure of a bond's sensitivity to interest rates. Mr. Kiesel favors foreign bonds with maturities of 5 to 10 years, which he said are more attractively priced than those issued in the United States.
Some bond managers are more bullish about United States bonds, largely because they are pessimistic about the economy. Robert S. Kapito, vice chairman of BlackRock Inc., said, "We think longer rates will actually decline as investors gain confidence the Fed will keep interest rates low."
Mr. Kapito contends that the economy will not recover until late 2003 and that investors who stay short will lose out on the higher yields offered by intermediate- and long-term bonds.
Bob Auwaerter, a senior fixed-income portfolio manager at the Vanguard Group, says that interest rates are not likely to move significantly higher until next year, but that investors should be aware that they are taking on greater risk if they hold long-term bonds. A mix of short- and intermediate-term bonds would best serve investors now, he said. "That way, you get diversification of interest rate sensitivity," he added.
STILL, for investors looking for a haven, better bets are short-term bond and money market funds, Mr. Richard said. When interest rates start to rise, their prices will decline far less than those of bonds with longer maturities, but their yields will reflect those rate increases faster, said Thomas Atteberry, who works with Mr. Rodriguez on FPA New Income. 
The funds that will pass along rate increases most rapidly will be money market funds, Mr. Papier noted. The average maturity of the securities in these funds is 52 days, which means that managers will be able to replace lower-yielding securities with those of higher yields within two months. 
For now, of course, the main problem of money market funds is their exceedingly low yield -- 1.26 percent, on average, according to iMoneyNet, a research firm. 
Short-term bond funds are a more rewarding alternative, Mr. Papier said. The average trailing 12-month yield of short-term bond funds tracked by Morningstar was 4.4 percent through July. 
Among Mr. Papier's current picks are SSgA Yield Plus, with a yield of 2.36 percent through July, and the Vanguard Short-Term Bond Index, which tracks the Lehman Brothers 1-5 Year Government/Corporate index. The fund's yield was 4.96 percent.
Sophit Lee, a certified financial planner and managing director of Docsa Capital Management in Portage, Mich., recently moved most of her 100 clients with fixed-income assets out of intermediate-term government bond funds and into short-term bond funds. 
Among the funds Ms. Lee uses are Turner Ultra Short Duration, Vanguard Short-Term Treasury and BlackRock Low Duration Bond. These funds all have low expenses, she added.
"Even though investors may be tempted to go after the higher yields of long-term bonds," she said, "at this time, we don't think investors are compensated for the risks they have to take."

As the Earth Warms, Will Companies Pay?

BYLINE:  By AMY CORTESE 

 BODY:
GLOBAL warming has been on the agenda of environmental activists for years. But it is also becoming a green issue of another kind -- discussed not only in terms of melting ice caps and endangered species, but as a problem that can cost corporations and their investors billions of dollars.
 With their confidence shaken in corporate bookkeeping and the market's omniscience, investors are starting to look for other possible "off balance sheet" land mines, including the hidden risks that could be associated with global climate change. 
 A scientific consensus has formed that greenhouse gases -- carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping emissions released by automobiles, power plants and industrial factories -- are causing the average temperature to increase, setting off environmental reactions ranging from rising water levels to droughts.
Losses from global warming were in evidence just this past week. A report released last Monday by the United Nations predicted that a two-mile-thick layer of brown haze blanketing Asia, caused in part by greenhouse gases, could severely cut rainfall and reduce India's rice harvest by 10 percent. And abnormally high temperatures in Eastern Europe have been partly blamed for the severe floods ravaging Prague and other beacons of European architecture. 
Munich Re, a large German insurance company, estimates that global warming could cost $300 billion annually by 2050 in weather damage, pollution, industrial and agricultural losses and other expenses. Companies may also face unexpected expenses because of compliance with future regulations, fines, taxes and caps on products that produce greenhouse gases. 
The impact of climate change varies by sector. Oil, gas and utilities, of course, are directly affected by changes in energy policy, while real estate is affected by coastal flooding and drought. But environmental activists and a growing number of investors have started to catch the corporate world's attention with their warnings that nearly all industries are exposed to some risk. Of particular concern are the costs of complying with a patchwork of regulations in the United States and abroad and the potential harm to a company's reputation if it is contributing to global warming.
In another ominous sign for chief executives and board members, some experts in corporate governance say company officers could be held accountable for failing to protect their companies from climate-related risk. And the lawsuits could come from governments as well as investors and other aggrieved parties. Peter Lehner, chief of the New York attorney general's Environmental Protection Bureau, said it was studying the issue of climate change and might sue polluters along the lines of the successful tobacco litigation by states in the 1990's.
YET most of the risks and potential costs go unreported. Although Securities and Exchange Commission rules require companies to disclose trends and uncertainties that could affect their stocks, few specific provisions exist for disclosing environmental liabilities. Critics say that even those regulations are barely enforced and that financial analysts rarely take such risks into account when assessing companies. 
It's not necessarily deliberate. In many cases, companies are unsure how to calculate potential liabilities -- especially when regulations have yet to be written. Because global warming is a long-term trend, it does not fit neatly into the quarterly reporting schedule or the outlook of many executives.
Still, many investors are taking such omissions seriously. "There was an assumption that everything important was valued by the market," said Robert K. Massie, executive director at the Coalition of Environmentally Responsible Economies, an association of environmental and investor groups that is based in Boston. "We know now that investors can be unaware of something with big impact."
Robert Monks, chairman of LENS Investment management and Ram Trust Services, and a longtime corporate governance activist, said companies need disclosure guidelines for environmental liability because "the market can't reflect something it doesn't know." 
Mr. Monks was behind a shareholder resolution this year aimed at reducing the duties of Lee Raymond, chairman and chief executive of Exxon Mobil, to mitigate what Mr. Monks saw as the damaging effects of Mr. Raymond's rigid view that global warming was not a problem for the company. The resolution got 20 percent of the vote, considered surprisingly strong.
The issue of executive and director liability is likely to be closely watched. Shareholder activists "are creating a record of these companies' being put on notice," said Christopher Walker, managing director of a group that assesses the insurance risks of greenhouse gases at the New York offices of Swiss Re, a large insurer. "Our concern is, will there be a shareholder action 5 or 10 years from now?" In particular, he said, emissions reduction is shaping up as a "clear liability issue" for corporate managements and boards.
Swiss Re is reviewing the companies it insures to determine what they are doing to manage climate change risk, he said, and is considering excluding from coverage companies or directors that are not addressing it.
Some companies, like DuPont, BP and Ford, have addressed risk from climate change in their annual reports and S.E.C. filings. In its 2001 annual report to the S.E.C., for example, DuPont acknowledged the possible consequences of the Kyoto treaty on greenhouse emissions. Although not ratified by the United States, the treaty will limit gases like carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide, which DuPont produces in chemical manufacturing. DuPont's report said it has been reducing these emissions since 1991, yet may still face further restrictions in some countries. 
IN contrast, Dow Chemical, a competitor, does not mention climate change or greenhouse gas emissions in its 2001 annual report to the S.E.C.
"We're going to be saying more about climate change," said Peter Molinari, a Dow executive who monitors climate change and the company's greenhouse gas emissions. For example, a social responsibility report to be released by Dow in September will chart its greenhouse gas emission reductions (15 percent since 1995) for the first time, Mr. Molinari said. 
Advocates of more disclosure say that in lieu of hard numbers, even qualitative assessments are helpful. Pressure for such assessments has been growing. Shareholder resolutions that ask companies to disclose or reduce greenhouse gas emissions won an unexpectedly high 30 percent of the vote at some companies during the 2002 annual meeting season. Law firms and insurance companies are setting up business units to deal with climate-related risks. And more institutional investors are lobbying the S.E.C. and companies for better disclosure of environmental risks, particularly those related to climate change.
"People are recognizing that it's an issue they are going to have to deal with," said Tracey Mihelic, a partner at the Baker & McKenzie law firm in Chicago and a member of its new practice dealing with energy and climate-change litigation.
Tim Little, executive director of the Rose Foundation for Communities and the Environment, a shareholder advocacy group based in Oakland, Calif., that has been campaigning for clearer guidelines on environmental reporting, said, "We see environmental disclosure as the next big corporate accounting scandal out there."
A report being drafted by the foundation predicted shareholder losses from "fines, penalties, and cleanup costs due to violation of environmental laws, increased costs due to changes in environmental regulation, and greater-than-expected costs due to understated or undisclosed liabilities." 
Innovest Strategic Value Advisors, based in New York, estimates that as much as 15 percent of the total market capitalization of major companies may be put at risk by climate change. 
A report in July by the World Resource Institute, an environmental research group, said shareholders in leading oil and gas companies could lose 6 percent or more of the value of their investments because of regulatory and other efforts to curb climate change. Of the 17 companies studied, only three -- British Petroleum, Conoco and Phillips Petroleum -- mentioned in their annual reports that climate policies and regulations could affect future business operations.
Big names are behind some of the campaigns. In May, Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors in New York organized the Carbon Disclosure Project, a petition supported by institutional investors representing $4 trillion in assets from Credit Suisse, Domini, Merrill Lynch Investment Managers and UBS Global Asset Management, among others. The investors wrote to 500 large corporations asking them to quantify their greenhouse gas emissions and plans for reducing them.
For many corporations, the process of even starting to calculate liability is difficult, because liability is contingent on future regulations. In addition, a single company can have several areas of seemingly insignificant risk that become significant when added up.
"How do you know what your risk is when the rules are not yet established?" said Ms. Mihelic of Baker & McKenzie. She said that if companies take action before regulations are in place -- say, building a more efficient plant -- those actions may not count toward credits when regulations are written years later.
"If I'm a board of directors, am I going to spend $100 million?" she asked. "If I address it now, are you going to sue me for addressing it too soon?" 
Nonetheless, she said, "every company is discussing this, whether or not they are saying it's an issue."

HEADLINE: As Disney Loses Steam, Insider Loses Patience 

BYLINE:  By LAURA M. HOLSON 

DATELINE: BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. 

 BODY:
THERE are few things Stanley P. Gold seems uncomfortable talking about. But on Thursday morning, over breakfast at his stately home not far from Rodeo Drive, he fidgeted when pressed to explain his dissatisfaction with Michael D. Eisner, chairman of the Walt Disney Company.
 Under Mr. Eisner, Disney's share price hit a historical high of $43.63 in April 2000. Since then, however, Mr. Gold, who runs Shamrock Holdings, the investment arm of the Disney family, has watched Disney's value plummet nearly 65 percent, and along with it much of the family fortune. Now, with a turnaround for the company expected to be at least a year or two away, Mr. Gold, who also serves on the Disney board, is at the center of a power struggle that threatens to shake up the corporate suite. 
 "The family owes a great debt of gratitude to Michael for what he has done," Mr. Gold said, picking at a bowl of blueberries and cantaloupe. "But my goal is to try to get the Disney Company to perform at a level of efficiency it hasn't seen for a number of years, given its fine assets." 
Mr. Gold, 59, a feisty lawyer who speaks in rapid-fire bursts, has long been a supporter of Mr. Eisner and was instrumental in helping him land the job of chairman and chief executive 18 years ago. But in recent weeks, Mr. Gold and a longtime friend and fellow board member, Roy E. Disney, a nephew of the late Walt Disney and owner of 17.5 million shares, have become outspoken in their criticism of Mr. Eisner.
In many ways, their stirring is reminiscent of the boardroom showdown in 1984 in which Mr. Gold helped oust Disney's sleepy management and replace it with Mr. Eisner, a victory Mr. Gold celebrated by buying license plates that read "10-3," the board's final vote on the issue.
Friends and colleagues of Mr. Gold say he is demanding that Mr. Eisner, who turned around the Disney brand in the 1980's but has stumbled in recent years, be held accountable for the company's poor showing and more responsive to the concerns of shareholders (read: the Disney family) and the board. 
In contrast, Mr. Eisner, now 60, has in recent years increasingly -- and at times quite publicly -- blamed others, including former executives, stock analysts and journalists, for Disney's travails during his tenure.
Both sides have much at stake. Roy Disney is one of the three largest individual shareholders, along with the Bass family and Mr. Eisner, who added $10 million worth of shares to his holdings last week.
The renewed activism of Mr. Gold is typical of how he, the son of a wholesale liquor salesman, who has made a career out of forcing managers to either clean up their acts or pack their bags, runs the Disney family investment interests.
"You have to remember, the Disney name is on the front door, and that is what Stanley and Roy are concerned about," said R. Rudolph Reinfrank, a managing general partner at Clarity Partners, who worked with Mr. Gold at Shamrock in the 1980's. "Stanley's interest is driven by his relationship with Roy as well as looking out for the shareholders."
Aside from his one remark, Mr. Gold declined to discuss the Walt Disney Company, his relationship with Mr. Eisner or the recent boardroom turmoil. And even Hollywood insiders cannot handicap whether he and Mr. Disney can pressure Mr. Eisner to follow through on his promise to come up with a succession plan or turn around the ailing ABC network, whose ratings have slid.
Mr. Gold has been representing Roy Disney's interests since becoming chief executive of Shamrock Holdings when it was founded in 1978, after practicing law for 18 years at a boutique firm in Los Angeles. The men met in the early 1970's, Mr. Gold said, when he helped Mr. Disney buy a ranch in Oregon, and they became friends.
"Politically, we are opposites," said Mr. Gold, a liberal Democrat. Stylistically, they are different, too. Friends say Mr. Gold is a street fighter with an outsized ego who delights in provoking debate, while the more patrician Mr. Disney tends to be more quiet and reserved.
"But philosophically we are the same," said Mr. Gold, who has a photograph of Mr. Disney and his wife, Patty Disney, on the desk in his study, one of several well-appointed rooms stuffed with modern paintings and knickknacks from Mr. Gold's travels. "He knows enormous amounts of things about science, sailing, mechanical stuff -- things I want to know about. He does crossword puzzles in ink." The Disneys also share Mr. Gold's passion for travel off the beaten track. Several years ago, Mr. Gold and his wife, Ilene, vacationed with the Disneys in Uzbekistan.
ON Mr. Gold's watch, the fortune of Roy Disney and his four children was diversified. Shamrock Group is a merchant bank with 15 investment professionals who work in several divisions. There are three main ones: a real estate unit; Shamrock Capital Advisors, an investment manager; and Shamrock Holdings, the investment portfolio of the Disney family. There are also some private equity funds and partnerships.
Industry executives estimate that Shamrock, which began with a $2 million investment, has about $1.7 billion under management, 75 percent of which belongs to the Disney family. Shamrock uses the Disney family stock, among other forms of capital, as collateral for loans to invest in other businesses.
Mr. Gold is often described as a takeover strategist, someone who buys a stake in a troubled company, then spends months or years pressuring management to shore up the business, with the hope of selling it for a profit.
The designation makes him bristle, particularly because it evokes the image of the swashbuckling 1980's-style corporate raiders who broke up companies solely to line their own pockets. But he conceded: "I'm persistent. I never go away when I have the right argument. I won't be bullied. I would tell you I am rational and, I am not complaining about my life, but because of my idiosyncrasies people call me a cowboy. But I don't see myself that way. I simply want my questions answered."
He is quiet for a moment, then asks in a flash of self-consciousness, "Have I been too defensive?"
Shamrock typically spends $25 million to $50 million on an investment, Mr. Gold said, and it invests both in the United States and abroad. But for the last 13 years, Shamrock has been buying stakes in companies in Israel, a place where he sees opportunity despite the current turmoil.
So far, Mr. Gold has invested about $800 million there, making Shamrock one of Israel's largest private foreign investors. "We made a point to get to know the political leadership, educators and businessmen before investing there," said Clifford A. Miller, senior consultant of Shamrock Capital Advisors, who works closely with Mr. Gold.
Mr. Gold, who is Jewish and a large charitable donor to Jewish and other causes, says he counts Israel's former prime minister, Ehud Barak, among his friends.
One of Shamrock's most successful investments was Koor Industries, Israel's leading industrial conglomerate, which makes products from chemicals to plates. In 1995, Shamrock acquired a 22.5 percent stake in Koor for about $150 million.
"It must have had 25 different operating companies," Mr. Gold said. "I don't know of any management alive who can manage all those divisions."
Mr. Gold encouraged Koor to sell or spin off several divisions and, in 1997, Shamrock said it sold its interest for about $256 million.
SHAMROCK also tried a $2.6 billion leveraged buyout of Polaroid in 1988. The effort failed, but Shamrock netted a tidy $40 million when it sold the shares it had been accumulating.
Shamrock has also had some notable failures. In 1991, Trefoil Capital Investors, an investment fund it runs, paid $100 million for a controlling stake in L.A. Gear, the athletic shoe company that in 1990 was No. 3 in the United States behind Nike and Reebok International, but had fallen on hard times. 
Mr. Gold said he replaced the management (he himself became chief executive of L.A. Gear in 1992), trimmed the inventory and product lines and sharply cut costs. But by 1997, with sales still faltering and the company almost bankrupt, Trefoil got out, losing an estimated $15 million, according to industry executives.
"That was nobody's fault but mine," Mr. Gold said. "I knew I was catching a falling knife." (L.A. Gear went bankrupt, but the brand still exists and is sold in specialty stores, according to Mr. Gold.)
Shamrock also lost an estimated $10 million on a stake in the Grand Union supermarket chain. "We had too much debt for a low-margin business," Mr. Gold said. The chain, like L.A. Gear, filed for bankruptcy protection.
THOSE high-profile gaffes have left some investors in Los Angeles wondering how Shamrock has fared in the recent market meltdown. For one, Disney's shrinking share price has made it harder to borrow against the family's stake to make more investments. Already, Shamrock has experienced one margin call, but a person close to the company said the family did not want to sell Disney stock.
"I would be foolish to tell you that a low stock price would not impact what we buy," said Mr. Gold, who declined to comment about the margin call. "But it is manageable." Besides, he added, sounding a little defensive again, "we have also had low-profile gains."
Born in 1942 in South Central Los Angeles, Mr. Gold graduated from the University of California at Los Angeles with a degree in political science in 1964. He received a law degree from the University of Southern California three years later, and on Friday was named chairman of the board of trustees. He married Ilene in 1964, and was a lawyer at Gang, Tyre, Ramer & Brown for 18 years before joining Shamrock.
Mr. Gold can be alternately charming and combative if a listener fails to comprehend a point quickly. On this Thursday morning at his home in Beverly Hills, the walls lined with brightly colored paintings by the likes of Raoul Dufy, he answers his own telephone with a curt "hello." He beams as he points out a fanciful drawing on his wall, an outsized slice of strawberry cheesecake floating on the East River by Claes Oldenburg, or a baseball in his collection signed by Babe Ruth.
"I like whimsical things," he said. Mr. Gold also likes vintage Porsches, and he has a garage full of them -- just past the pool and wide lawn. 
But his most recent hobby -- something he picked up three years ago -- is racing Porsches. "I think trying things you are not good at is a way to keep you active and young," Mr. Gold said. He stroked a nascent beard on his chin and laughed, explaining that a fellow driver suggested a goatee might help him drive as quickly as his younger peers.
One thing Mr. Gold is struggling with these days is why Disney continues to fare poorly.
People close to the Disney family say Mr. Gold and Mr. Disney have voiced their concerns privately since earlier this year. Such messages were often delivered by Mr. Gold, one former Disney executive said. But if Mr. Disney had a problem with the Disney brand, perhaps whether to continue licensing Disney characters to hot-dog makers, he would tell Mr. Eisner directly, the executive said. "Roy always won those arguments," he added.
But it was not until two weeks ago, when Disney announced that fourth-quarter earnings would be lower than expected because of lackluster attendance at theme parks and a slower-than-anticipated economy, that terse words were exchanged. Wall Street punished Disney's stock, which hit an eight-year low in the days after the announcement. The news came on the heels of a June board meeting at which Mr. Eisner presented a five-year growth plan that some board members found disappointing, said a person close to the board.
Aside from the theme parks, and whether international visitors return to the American ones anytime soon, ABC remains Disney's biggest problem. If its fall season fails to attract more viewers -- and advertisers -- Mr. Eisner will have to answer to the board.
Mr. Gold and Mr. Disney have faced tough times before. Back in 1984, Disney's board was split over who it thought should succeed Ron Miller, Walt Disney's son-in-law, who was being ousted as chief executive. One side heavily favored the more corporate Dennis Stanfill, a former investment banker who was head of 20th Century Fox.
The other camp, which included Mr. Gold and Mr. Disney, wanted Mr. Eisner and another film executive, Frank G. Wells, who became Disney's president and later died in a helicopter crash. Mr. Gold fiercely lobbied the other board members, and Mr. Eisner, who was then Hollywood's golden boy, won.
Mr. Eisner remains cordial with Mr. Gold and Mr. Disney, but he knows how formidable a foe he has in each. Friends of Mr. Eisner say, however, that he, too, has keen survival skills.
In other words, stay tuned.

HEADLINE: The Nation: Pressed for Success; 
When the Going Gets Tough, the Tough Put On Suits

BYLINE:  By GUY TREBAY 

 BODY:
BACK in the heady days when the Dow hovered at 10,000 and investors careered on the Nasdaq with the adrenaline thrill of riders on the Coney Island Cyclone, the time-tested boundaries between the public and private selves in business got weirdly blurred. People began to conflate what the sociologist Erving Goffman labeled the "backstage" and "outside regions" in the theater of the self. They moved the unconstrained self to center stage -- to the office, the boardroom, the interview. 
 They slipped out of what Mr. Goffman called the "situational harness" of business uniforms, the kind that clearly convey what you do. Corporate officers dressed for work in gym sweats. Bankers turned up at the office dressed for golf. Even presidential candidates lost track of the symbolism that used to come in every politician's starter kit and began campaigning dressed like the guy who mows your lawn. 
 But tough times call for legible dressing. Tie sales are now stronger than they have been in years. The suit is back for men, goes the chorus, as people flock for safety to a uniform that evolved from court dress in the days of Charles II, in 17th-century England. Over the next 200 years, it shed it's aristocratic trappings and morphed into what Andrew Bolton, the associate curator of the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, called a "democratic, urbanized garment to clothe an ever-expanding middle class." 
That class has been pummeled lately, left with diminished portfolios, elusive retirement prospects and, as it turns out, nothing to wear at the office or when looking for jobs. "The main trend we're seeing is the return to dress furnishings and dress clothing," said Michael Ostrove, the general merchandising manager for furnishings at Paul Stuart, the family-owned Madison Avenue haberdashery. Mark Shulman, the chief operating officer for Retail Brand Alliance, which owns Brooks Brothers, said, "Men are dressing up for work again."
Starting Sept. 3, in fact, the men among the 3,000 employees of Deutsche Bank in London will have to ditch the sartorial style that an internal memorandum dubbed "clubbing attire" and go back to the one that scholars say has symbolized self-restraint, efficiency and the specialized skill sets called white-collar work since the rise of urbanism in the 19th century. They will return to the suit. 
In an e-mail message to employees, Mark Ferron, the chief operating officer of the bank's global markets units, noted that a number of Deutsche Bank's rivals had already altered their dress codes. He called a stop to the jeans, khakis, T-shirts and sneakers that were among the last remaining souvenirs of the dot-com boom. "As an organization that prides itself on focus," Mr. Ferron wrote, "we can do no less."
Mr. Ferron echoed an observation increasingly common in all kinds of offices -- not just those where the boss shops on Saville Row. "We feel," Mr. Ferron wrote, "there has been a significant shift over the past 18 months among our clients regarding dress code."
Embattled times, in other words, call for suitable armor, a reality both Al Gore and George W. Bush embraced with alacrity when American fears of a constitutional crisis sent both of them racing to the closet to switch their turtlenecks and cowboy jackets for something that said Leader of the Free World.
Both men already owned suits, of course, unlike a good percentage of the public, who had been lulled into thinking of the suit as fashion's dodo, something never again to be seen. "You could afford to be a little more casual when the economy was fat," said Mr. Shulman of Brooks Brothers. "You were not as worried about your job and how you looked." Now, he added, "a lot of people are out of work and have to look for employment." And not many of those people are likely to turn up for a job interview in Dockers and running shoes. 
P EOPLE have been predicting the end of the suit for as long as I've been in the fashion business," said Alan Flusser, the author of "Dressing the Man: Mastering The Art of Permanent Fashion" and a believer in the Wildean aphorism that "a well-tied tie is the first serious step in life."
It's certainly true that death and resurrection of the suit is a stock story in the rag trade. And it's just as true the suit has rarely, in the centuries since its inception, been in serious danger of losing its hegemony. With the possible exception of the unstitched dhoti, few garments have enjoyed a longer continuous run. It arose as a replacement for the padded doublet that itself held the fashion for 300 years. The breeches worn beneath the newly loosened coat lost their lacing and began to be worn capacious and low. A waistcoat was inserted behind the opening of the coat and, as the art historian Anne Hollander noted, "The three-piece suit was born." 
Social critics, whenever they focused on it, tended to deride the suit as "imperial" in its ideology. Yet, the truth is that for at least a century the suit has been the workaday uniform for a vast global middle class. For starters, no one has yet come up with a garment that democratizes the body better by concealing disparities in the male anatomy. And no one has devised a better way to ensure that, as Clifford Grodd, the president of Paul Stuart, observed, the "naked ambition" of the workplace is kept under suitably neutral wraps.
"The big problem with casual Friday," as one refugee of Silicon Valley recently put it, "was that people always knew you were making a career move because you had to put on a suit."
So far, nothing "has come along to replace the formality of a proper dress shirt, a necktie and a business suit," said Mr. Flusser. Not even the space-age coveralls that Pierre Cardin once prophesied as the uniform of the 21st century.
No garment, it turns out, has proved more durable, flexible or forgiving. It is flattering besides. "A suit is obviously a more youthful costume," noted Ms. Hollander, the author of "Sex and Suits: The Evolution of Modern Dress." "This is a truth the female sex learned a long, long time ago from Chanel."

HEADLINE: The Chinese Labyrinth 

 BODY:
China was supposed to begin a carefully planned transfer of power to a new generation of leaders this fall. But as senior leaders return from their secretive annual summer beach retreat, those plans appear to be in disarray. Back-room bargaining continues, with current leaders pushing to ensure that their proteges are rewarded with suitably powerful jobs in the new leadership lineup. And in a development that could prolong the transition and lead to damaging power struggles at the top, Jiang Zemin is now said to be angling to keep at least one of the three top jobs he now holds: president, party leader and chairman of the Central Military Commission. 
 That the fate of 1.3 billion people in a nuclear power with one of the world's most dynamic economies should be secretly thrashed out by a handful of unelected leaders should be disturbing not only to the people of China but also to Americans and others around the world as well. In the quarter-century since the end of the Cultural Revolution, China has moved from government by official whim toward a more predictable, law-based society. But at the pinnacle of power, the culture of palace intrigue that has weakened China for centuries appears to have barely evolved at all. 
 While the arcane maneuvering continues, important decisions continue to be deferred. The transformation of China's industrial economy has been striking but remains awkwardly incomplete. Thousands of money-losing state factories have been shut down or sold, cutting millions of workers adrift without the housing, medical and pension benefits they used to receive through their state-run workplaces. Those changes have brought labor unrest, large internal migrations and expensive new demands on local governments. Beijing must meet the needs of these dislocated millions by constructing a new, government-financed social safety net or face mounting social turmoil.
It must also refinance and reform a banking system that misallocates credit, stifles entrepreneurship and is drowning in red ink. Virtually all the country's savings are channeled through state-controlled banks that lend on the basis of political connections, not economic merit. Fixing the banks will be costly, but failing to do so will slow the rapid economic growth that Chinese Communist leaders feel they must maintain to secure their power.
China's urgent need for political reform is underscored by the current succession uncertainties. Such Machiavellian maneuvering is hard to avoid in a one-party state with no checks and balances and no public accountability. China needs a modernized political system to go along with its modernized economy, including a free press, real judicial independence and multiparty elections. That is not likely to come about any time soon, but some first, tentative steps are overdue, including a clear separation of government offices from Communist Party positions. 
On the international front, Chinese leaders have long dreamed of returning their country to the front rank of great powers. With that goal now in sight, Beijing must decide what kind of power it means to be: an economic juggernaut or a military one, a constructive force for managing international issues like weapons proliferation or a disruptive power seeking to exploit crises for its own narrow advantage. Since Sept. 11, China has acted responsibly, offering the United States intelligence cooperation against international terrorism and counseling moderation to its allies North Korea and Pakistan. China's leaders should continue this international course. They should also take the steps needed to expand economic and political freedoms at home.

Going Digi tal When Going Back to School

BYLINE:  By KARL RUSSELL 

 BODY:
What gadgets will be hot sellers for students this year? Based on third-quarter sales last year, the answer is anything digital and portable.
 One of the strongest sellers last year was graphing calculators, and the trend should continue, according to NPDTechworld, a market research company. "Scientific calculators are now turning into mini-computers that offer computer connectivity and software and data download capability to allow students to get a full understanding of their math homework," said Stephen Baker, an analyst at NPDTechworld. 
 The demand for new technology, like notebook PC's and MP3 players, is expected to continue to erode sales of older products, like desktop computers and CD players. KARL RUSSELL

Stocks Percolate Higher After Mixed News

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The stock market had two big days last week, one down and one up. Despite a big decline on Tuesday, a rally on the next day was enough to earn the market another positive week. 
 Worries about sluggish growth weighed on stocks, although Federal Reserve policy makers indicated on Tuesday that they were prepared to cut their short-term interest rate target further if the economy remained weak. 
 Another possible negative for stocks was the selloff in the bond market at week's end that pushed interest rates higher and could lead to a rise in mortgage rates. The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note rose to 4.33 percent, up from 4.26 percent.
 Among the gainers were Hewlett-Packard, I.B.M., Wal-Mart Stores and Walt Disney. Qwest Communi-cations shares jumped on reports that the company had received strong bids for its telephone directories. 
 For the week, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 2.2 percent, to 928.77. The Dow Jones industrial average, which eked out a 0.4 percent gain for the week, ended at 8,778.06. The Nasdaq composite index finished its second consecutive week in the black, with a jump of 4.2 percent to 1,361.01. JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

HEADLINE: Americans Stay Home, and Europe Feels a Pinch 

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON, Aug. 17 

 BODY:
They gather in sneakered gaggles at Buckingham Palace. They swelter in art-hungry lines at the Uffizi in Florence. With their cameras and guidebooks, the foreign tourists rubberneck the Eiffel Tower in Paris.
 And, across the Continent -- from the ritziest of hotel foyers to the seediest of souvenir stalls -- Europeans lie in wait each summer to pounce on these visitors' dollars and yen and euros to chase away the winter doldrums. 
 But, this year, in Rome or London, Paris or Berlin, hoteliers and tour organizers say that one group of travelers is markedly underrepresented -- Americans. 
Since Sept. 11, when travel across the Atlantic was briefly suspended, air traffic between North America and Western Europe has recovered only slowly. Scheduled flights are still down 13 percent from last year's levels, according to airline industry figures. In Britain, the number of American tourists is 10 percent less than in 2000 -- the last year before a combination of foot-and-mouth disease and fears of terrorism sent American and most other visitor numbers into a free fall in 2001. In France, tour operators were stunned in April to record a drop-off in American visitors of almost a third.
With stock markets sliding in the United States and economies slumbering in Continental Europe, the stemmed flow of Americans and their dollars has shown that, almost one year after the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the economic impact still ripples across the globe. The slowdown in visitors from across the Atlantic was being felt even before this month's disastrous floods in Central Europe devastated tourism in centers from Salzburg, Austria, and Prague to Dresden, Germany.
But what heartens some of Europe's tour organizers is a sense of relief that Americans are beginning to return at all, and that, in some cases, where Americans have stayed home, visitors from other countries have come in their place.
"There are some green shoots beginning to show," said Nick Walsh, a senior manager at the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust in Stratford-Upon-Avon, England. "Last year we were only just beginning to recover from the foot-and-mouth outbreak when Sept. 11 happened, and one thing segued into another. But, certainly, there are American accents audible again outside Shakespeare's birthplace, though still not the full number we would expect in summer."
At the Tower of London, Jacqueline Gazzard, a spokeswoman, said that while there were fewer American visitors this year, there were more Europeans and Asians. "Today it was Italians," she said. "There were Italians everywhere. The Americans are being more careful because they haven't got as much money. I don't think it's a completely bleak picture. But it's going to be a long haul."
At least Americans themselves have come to contemplate the possibility of traveling again.
"I've had real angst about flying since Sept. 11,' said John Peixinho, 36, a decorator from Newport, R.I., who had been planning to travel to Germany last year but canceled after the terror attacks. 
"But time heals the fear," he said in a telephone interview from the United States. "I wouldn't even consider a trip to Europe last fall, but maybe in a couple of months. I am thinking about Germany in the fall." 
One thing that has endured is America's reputation from the Scottish Highlands to downtown Berlin as a nation of high rollers ready to splurge on fancy accommodations. 
"For the country-house type of hotel at the top end, the Americans used to be our best customers," said Scott Armstrong, a Scottish tourism executive, with some nostalgia. Indeed, hotels including the five-star Adlon in Berlin, next to the Brandenburg Gate, and the Plaza Athenee in Paris reported a sustained -- if slightly edgy -- revival of American business.
"All I can say is that we've noticed Americans are making more and more last-minute reservations," said Veronique Surrel, a spokeswoman for the Plaza Athenee. "We don't know why. We don't know if this is linked to the economy or a fear of flying."
In other words, whatever the political differences or trade wars between Europe and America, and however skeptically the Europeans may perceive the Bush administration's policies on issues like war with Iraq, dollars and cents tell a more nuanced story.
At the Tower of London, for instance, up to 40 percent of the more than two million visitors in recent years have been Americans. (That percentage fell to about 30 percent this year.) In Britain, even in a bad year like this one, foreign visitors spent about $7.5 billion in the first six months of the year, the British Tourist Authority said. 
In Italy, where the number of American visitors was down 11 percent this year in the so-called art cities of Rome, Florence, Venice and Naples, tourism employs about two million Italians and accounts for one-twelfth of the economy, according to official figures. The slowdown in tourism could cost Italy about $2 billion in lost revenues, partly because of Japan's economic woes but also because there are fewer Americans visiting, La Stampa newspaper reported.
"The U.S. represented a market that had started to pick up pretty fast in the last five years with a constant increase that has now been interrupted," said Antonio Allegra, director of the tourist authority in the Sicilian resort of Taormina. "I have no doubt that the main reason for this drop is international terrorism."
Across the Continent, though, there seem to be anomalies. In London's West End theater district, for instance, where audiences were sharply reduced after Sept. 11, the revival has been uneven, said Paul James, commercial manager of the Society of London Theater. While musicals like "The Lion King" and "Mamma Mia!" are fully booked, he said, "plays are finding it a little harder, which would suggest that the Americans have not all come back."
The reduction in the number of Americans in France, moreover, seems primarily to affect areas outside Paris like the chateaus of the Loire Valley. Michael Petit Jean, the manager at Chateau de Chenonceau, said: "We have enormously fewer Americans traveling this year compared to last year. I don't think I'm giving away any secrets by telling you that there were some terrorist attacks in September. We're sorry about this. They're a very agreeable group with a lot of money."
Elsewhere, numbers are down but not so drastically. According to the tourism office in Paris, the drop in American visitors to the French capital itself was 17 percent compared with one year ago, while the national figure for the fall in American tourism was around 30 percent. Indeed, said Karine Lefebvre, a spokeswoman for the Paris tourism office, even with reduced overall numbers, American was still the dominant nationality among foreigners in the French capital in June, accounting for 15 percent of visitors while Britons made up only 9 percent of the total.
Indeed, according to some travelers, the picture is so uneven that more Americans are visiting the French Riviera resort of St.-Tropez than ever before, even though the overall numbers visiting France are down. Significantly, though, the image of the American abroad may have shifted.
Traditionally, French perceptions of Americans were framed in degrees of brashness or loudness, reflecting the broader French suspicion of American hegemony. But a study by tourism authorities in the Ile de France region surrounding Paris said Americans visiting France were different this year: "less blindly confident about their country, more worried than they will admit, but more American and more patriotic than ever before."
In Italy, residents of Rome say the cobbled streets of the Centro Storico -- the historic center that embraces such tourist draws as the Pantheon, the Piazza Navona and the Trevi fountain -- are less thronged with visitors than in other years. But on the Amalfi coast, south of Naples, hotel and restaurant operators report only the most marginal downturn.
"I think we can consider ourselves like an oasis in the generally gray tourist panorama this year," said Nicola Esposito, director of the local tourist authority.
In one way, the most striking economic damage may be still to come. British Airways and several other European airlines say they have canceled some of their trans-Atlantic flights for Sept. 11 this year because so few people -- American or otherwise -- were prepared to fly on that day.

HEADLINE: Troubled Airlines Face Reality: Those Cheap Fares Have a Price 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT with MICHELINE MAYNARD 

 BODY:
After seething in airport lines and fidgeting on delayed flights, Americans are unlikely to think of the last decade as a golden age of air travel. Soon, however, a little nostalgia may begin to set in.
 For all their frustrations with stingier services, millions of travelers still count on full-fare convenience at no-frills prices. But with businesses unwilling to pay the high fares that have subsidized leisure fliers, and the Internet giving travelers new tools to find bargains, that formula is giving way. 
 Now, suffering their worst financial losses ever, the nation's biggest carriers -- through bankruptcy filings, broad restructurings or more subtle responses to the stark moves of their sickest competitors -- plan to start bringing service more closely in line with their fares. 
They will make travel less convenient for business fliers by cutting flights and lengthening connection times at some hubs. They also hope to exact more of a sacrifice from people flying on the most heavily discounted tickets, with ever more spartan cabin service.
If that sounds like Southwest Airlines, it is because the industry's giants are trying to keep pace with Southwest, whose profitability amid their losses has earned it a stock market value bigger than all its rivals' combined.
"The marketplace has changed; we haven't changed," said Gordon M. Bethune, the chief executive of Continental Airlines. "We may be starting to."
US Airways, battered by the growth of low-fare service on its once-lucrative East Coast routes, filed for bankruptcy protection last Sunday, saying it would eliminate many flights. American Airlines said on Tuesday that it would lay off 7,000 workers and alter its schedules to minimize the time planes sit idle, at the cost of longer waits for passengers. United Airlines on Wednesday threatened to seek bankruptcy protection later this year, if its unions do not agree to deep wage cuts.
Crisis has come to the nation's airlines before, of course. They lost billions of dollars in the recessions of the early 1980's and 90's. But the frustrations and fear created by Sept. 11 have affected travel far more than a downturn alone, and the six biggest carriers -- American, United, Delta Air Lines, Northwest Airlines, Continental and US Airways -- collectively lost a record $6.9 billion from October through June.
Since the government deregulated air travel in 1978, the big carriers have repeatedly defied predictions of their demise, in the process outlasting upstarts -- from People Express to Pro Air -- that were expected to slay them.
Likewise, the significance of the current overhauls could be diluted by, among other things, the industry's powerful unions, an unexpectedly strong economic recovery or a slowing of growth at Southwest, the discount carrier now in 30 states. One or more of the big carriers, angling to gain market share, might resist the push to curtail service and amenities.
Still, most executives and analysts say the airline business cannot continue in its current form for long. The steady advance of Southwest and its ilk, including JetBlue in New York, has destroyed the giant carriers' profits on many routes they once dominated. The Internet, meanwhile, lets business and leisure travelers alike tinker with itineraries and reduce fares by hundreds of dollars. Neither of those forces is likely to recede when the economy recovers.
This leaves the traditional airlines with the biggest fleets and broadest networks calculating ways to deliver service that is less expensive than today's, yet just superior enough to that of the low-fare airlines to justify higher prices.
"People would like to be able to have assigned seats and convenient schedules with Southwest prices," said Alfred E. Kahn, the economist who oversaw deregulation as the final chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board. That was possible, he said, during the boom of the 1990's, when the economy grew so quickly that business travelers would pay almost any fare.
In today's economy, he added, "that just can't be done."

Test Market
Discounters Deflect California Challenge
In the busy passageways of San Francisco International Airport about five years ago, United -- then the world's largest airline -- seemed to have devised an effective response to Southwest's juggernaut.
Shuttle by United, a service exclusively for the West Coast, attracted thousands of dot-com pioneers, corporate executives and other travelers who wanted both cheap fares and the convenience of a global carrier.
Between 1994, when Shuttle began, and 1997, United's share of the air travel market within California shot up to 29 percent from 22 percent, according to Back Aviation Solutions, a research firm in New Haven. Southwest's share slipped to 54 percent from 56 percent.
Yet like almost every other attempt by a major airline to mimic the discounters, United's succeeded only briefly. 
The airline had chosen San Francisco as Shuttle's Northern California base, despite the fog that frequently slowed operations at the airport, because it is a hub for United flights to Asia and around the United States. Based in sunnier San Jose, Southwest suffered fewer costly delays, allowing it to make the most of the quick turnarounds at the gate on which the airline and its workers pride themselves.
As with its costs, the fares at Southwest remained lower over all. So when the slumping economy slowed traffic growth in 2000, Southwest reasserted its dominance. Its share of the California market reached a record 63 percent last year, and United's share fell to 19 percent as the bigger airline, losing more money than any other after Sept. 11, sharply reduced service.
Since another California airline, Pacific Southwest Airlines, began offering low fares in 1949 -- it cost $5.65 to fly from San Diego to Oakland back then -- the state's skies have followed a similar storyline. Discounters suffer defeats, and even disappear. (P.S.A. was absorbed by what then was called US Air in 1988.) But over the long haul, they succeed in destroying the fat profit margins of full-service airlines.
In the last 15 years, the inflation-adjusted price of an average ticket within California has fallen 31 percent, to $79.48, according to Back.
Indeed, for many travelers, the best part of the discount airlines is not having to fly them in order to enjoy their benefits. 
"I think Southwest is terrific," said Lisa Ackerly, 42, a marketing executive from Half Moon Bay, Calif., 29 miles from the San Francisco airport, who travels twice a month to the Los Angeles headquarters of her employer, Edmunds.com, an information service for car buyers. "I wish I had invested in them."
Nonetheless, Ms. Ackerly prefers to fly out of San Jose on American, whose fares are competitive with those of Southwest. On American, she earns frequent-flier miles that can lead to a free ticket overseas or a first-class upgrade.
Low-fare airlines have begun cutting into the big airlines' business on longer routes, as well. The two-year-old JetBlue flies from Kennedy International in New York to Oakland and, in Southern California, to Ontario and Long Beach. Its fares are as low as $99 each way cross-country. On Sept. 15, Southwest will start flying from Baltimore to Los Angeles, opening its first coast-to-coast route.
"With the huge numbers of people residing in the California cities, you get the right price in there and you can fill up the airplane," said Richard Sweet, executive director of sales and marketing for Southwest.

Fare Shopping
Even Corporations Want Bargains Now
These days, many airports look a lot like those in California, which was long considered an island of airline competition in a sea of oligopolies, where one or two big carriers dominated. Southwest flies to 58 cities, JetBlue flies to 19, and both have invaded the once-expensive airports of New England and New York State. Spirit Airlines has made such inroads in Detroit that Northwest will match its $154 round trip to La Guardia Airport starting Sept. 3. Northwest's current fare, with no advance purchase requirement, is $318.
The growth of discount carriers is the primary reason that the average price to fly a mile fell 25 percent, adjusting for inflation, from 1991 to last year.
Unable to raise the prices they charged leisure travelers for fares booked well in advance, the biggest carriers have instead stretched the gap between restricted fares and the last-minute tickets purchased by businesspeople. Many companies simply paid the bill, and their employees got on the plane.
"In the roaring 90's, when business was good, it cost you $1,200 to fly out to the West Coast -- $2,400 round trip -- and you didn't think twice about it," said Dave Barger, the president of JetBlue. 
But while business fares were rising, the Internet was beginning to give companies technological power to match what the airlines had been using against them since the 1980's. Yield-management systems had helped the carriers figure out the maximum they could charge each flier. Priceline.com, Expedia, Travelocity and other Web sites helped companies determine the minimum they could spend on a ticket -- by leaving a little later, for example, or using an alternate airport served by a discount carrier.
"Overnight, the airlines lost control of their product," said Cameron Burr, a partner at the Burr Group, a private equity firm in New Canaan, Conn., that invests in aviation, and a son of a founder of People Express. "People can game the system."
Mr. Bethune, Continental's chief executive, said, "They can do things they weren't even aware of a few years ago."
When the economy slowed in 2000, airline executives decided they had no choice but to raise business fares again, trying to wring more revenue from passengers who have no choice but to take a specific flight. In recent months, a typical corporate ticket has been almost six times as expensive as a discount ticket, up from a multiple of about three in 1997, according to American Express Corporate Travel.
That strategy boomeranged, however, causing a revolt that led to last week's turmoil, analysts said. Companies have canceled trips or taken to buying discount tickets in advance and paying the penalty if employees' plans change. Some employees, meanwhile, are shopping on the Internet themselves, bypassing corporate travel offices whose negotiated fares are often no bargain anymore.
For example, DaimlerChrysler employees often eschew the bulk discount they receive from Northwest Airlines -- and the convenience of assigned seating -- to fly Southwest between their headquarters near Detroit and two large plants in St. Louis.
"With companies like Southwest, their fares are affordable as is," said David Weiner, Daimler's corporate travel manager. "It's not like you would require any additional discount."
Booz Allen Hamilton, a management consulting firm that sends employees around the world, has reduced its travel spending by more than 20 percent this year, said Douglas Weeks, the firm's travel manager. Satisfying their bosses' directives to save money, consultants are more often using videoconferencing or flying out of airports that have low-fare competition, like Baltimore-Washington International.
"The airlines need to figure out a way to close the gap" between leisure and business fares, Mr. Weeks said. "It's really backfired."
The troubles caused by the recession and the tepid economic recovery are not a surprise to executives at United, American and other major carriers. During much of the 90's boom, they insisted that they were working hard to avoid the sort of busts that had plagued the industry. Though they added capacity, they did so less feverishly than in the 1980's. As they slowly bought new planes, they retired older jets that were more costly to operate.
"Our testosterone levels are pretty low," Gregory D. Brenneman, then the president of Continental, said in 1998. "We just want to make money." If there was a blind spot, it had to do with labor costs. Led by the employee-owned United, the major airlines negotiated one "industry-leading" contract after another with unions, ratcheting up pay after years in which it had often stagnated.
But just as the bubble obscured truths about the broad economy, it convinced airline executives that low-fare competition would not require them to change the fundamentals of their business model. Last week, three of the top six airlines, almost in unison, acknowledged that they had changed their minds.

A La Carte
A Quick Connection Will Cost Extra
Airlines may be among the world's most complex companies, but one of the linchpins of their operations is easy to see in the sky above almost any major airport.
Planes form a diagonal line three or four jets long on a clear day. For a while, the airport seems to be home to nothing but landings. Then the parade ends, and a new one begins in the opposite direction, as plane after plane takes off.
In between landings and takeoffs, passengers rush to switch planes. To minimize connection times, the first planes to arrive wait for passengers from the last to have landed.
American, which invented this system and has been the world's largest carrier since it bought Trans World Airlines last year, plans to curtail the ritual and scramble its jets. Now, American said last week, it will get them back in the air more quickly, allowing the airline to save money by flying each plane more often.
At American's hubs in Chicago, Dallas and St. Louis, that means travelers ultimately will do the waiting, as long as 15 minutes extra to make a connection. Eventually, analysts say, American may charge extra for a fast connection.
Such choices are likely to play an ever larger role in air travel. Struggling to turn a profit against the head-on competition of discounters, carriers will reduce capacity and trim service over all, analysts say.
"Think about flying Southwest," said Sam Peltzman, an economist at the University of Chicago who studies the industry. Increasingly, "that's what it's going to be like."
Already, hot meals are only a memory for many travelers in coach, along with the library of magazines, free playing cards and other perks. After eliminating as many of these items as they think leisure travelers will trade for low fares -- as they do every day on Southwest -- airlines may try to entice business travelers to pay a premium to get them back.
"We're looking for ways to provide the amenities for the higher-paying customers and provide less for those who don't care for that," said Mr. Bethune of Continental. (Business class would remain a distinct, and even more expensive, option.) His airline has already eliminated free alcoholic beverages on international flights, and it is considering measures like limiting the lowest-paying passengers to one free checked bag.
"Right now, you just don't see the difference" between full-fare and discount tickets, said Mr. Weeks, the Booz Allen travel manager. "If you were able to say, 'I paid three times the discount fare because I wanted an aisle seat and frequent-flier miles,' then maybe it makes sense."
In an experiment that airlines in the United States are watching closely, Lufthansa, the big German carrier, has taken the idea a step further. It now flies between Newark and Dusseldorf using a plane with only roomy, business-class seats.
Some airlines may have hoped that the government would rescue them from the toughest aspects of fixing their broken businesses. Through hard lobbying in the days after Sept. 11, they won $5 billion in cash to make up for their losses while the attacks shut down air travel. As important, Congress authorized $10 billion in loan guarantees. 
Critics worried that the Air Transportation Stabilization Board, the four-member panel created by Congress to dispense the guarantees, would set overly lax terms. If so, the guarantees might postpone the streamlining and even the consolidation needed to align airline capacity with passenger demand, they warned. The critics also questioned the wisdom of providing government assistance to companies that might be headed to bankruptcy court.
"Is there a market failure that the government can correct?" asked Steven Morrison, an economics professor at Northeastern University who has written extensively about the airline industry. "No. The bailout was a transfer rather than helping economic efficiency."
Still, Professor Morrison and other experts have generally praised the board's work. Only one applicant, America West Airlines, has successfully completed the process, winning $380 million in loan guarantees in exchange for a government claim on a one-third stake in the airline.
The board has denied applications from other carriers, including Vanguard Airlines, which then shut down operations; Frontier Flying Service; National Airlines; and Spirit.
US Airways got conditional approval for a $900 million loan guarantee last month, but must complete its restructuring in bankruptcy court -- shrinking its operations and sharply cutting labor costs -- to win the taxpayer backing. United has applied for a $1.8 billion guarantee, but has been told to obtain "broader, deeper and longer concessions from all stakeholders" if it expects to win approval, according to Jake Brace, United's chief financial officer.
The biggest lift that the struggling airlines could receive is beyond their control: the spread of some of their labor problems and high costs to the discount carriers. As Southwest continues to grow, some analysts say it will struggle to keep its average wages at their relatively low levels, because a smaller portion of its work force will be short-tenured and therefore inexpensive. Southwest executives deny this, saying that more than 100 cities have asked them to begin serving their airports.
Even if Southwest is wrong, its advantages will probably erode slowly. That means fares are unlikely to rise quickly. 
But many travelers are likely to gain a keen, if unwelcome, understanding of the trade-offs that make those fares possible.
"While I adore Southwest, and think they're half my justification before God," said Mr. Kahn, one of the architects of deregulation, "I hate standing in those long lines."

 CORRECTION:
A chart on Sunday with a front-page article about changes planned by the airline industry misstated the first-quarter domestic operating results and, for several carriers, the operating cost per seat-mile, the standard industry measure. A corrected excerpt appears today, on Page C4. 
The article also referred incorrectly to Alfred E. Kahn, the Civil Aeronautics Board chairman who was instrumental in deregulating the industry. He was not the final chairman; that was C. Dan McKinnon.

In Last Strike Year, Winning but Losing

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
On second thought, maybe it's no surprise that the Montreal Expos have had a relatively good season. Maybe the surprise is that they are not doing even better. This, after all, could be a strike-interrupted season, and history tells us that the Expos are a terrific strike-season team. 
 In 1981, after a 50-day strike split the season, the Expos finished first in the National League East in the second half, then beat Philadelphia in the playoffs, three games to two, on a Steve Rogers shutout in Game 5 before losing to Los Angeles, three games to two, in the league championship series on Rick Monday's ninth-inning home run against Rogers. 
 In 1994 the Expos never got to the playoffs because there were no playoffs. When the players struck Aug. 12, the Expos had the best record in the major leagues, 74-40. Missing a chance to prove they were the best team in the majors made the Expos a stepchild of baseball history. It could have also marked the turning point for the franchise. 
"We had a very dominant team, a team that was even cocky," said Claude Delorme, a rarity as a member of the organization remaining from that storied season. "We had a young team but a team that felt it could win any series, not only win two of three but sweep. When we went to New York, the guys were talking not about winning the series but about sweeping. The team felt it had the skill sets to be able to come back and win games in the late innings. It was a team you always knew you had to stay till the end. It was a fun team to watch, entertaining for the fans."
Delorme, who was then vice president for stadium operations, recalled that as the Expos were building their record and their lead, they were selling about 15,000 tickets on the day of each game and they were drawing crowds consistently in the mid-30,000's.
That was a team loaded with talent -- Pedro Martinez, John Wetteland, Larry Walker, Moises Alou, Marquis Grissom, Ken Hill. It was no accident that the Expos led the Atlanta Braves by six games when the strike began.
"When the strike began," said Delorme, who is now executive vice president for business affairs, "everyone felt it was going to be of short duration. The players felt it was going to get resolved. No one would have thought it would have led to the postseason being canceled."
That thinking changed once the strike reached the beginning of September, Delorme said. "We realized what was at stake," he said. "We realized what it could lead to."
On Sept. 14 Bud Selig, then the acting commissioner, announced the cancellation of the remainder of the season, the playoffs and the World Series. There would be no division championship or postseason games for the Expos.
The Braves' 68-46 record was second best in the National League. The Yankees' 70-43 record was second best in the majors. That season was the first with three divisions in each league, and the Texas Rangers reached the strike leading the American League West with a 52-62 record. 
The strike squashed the hopes of the Expos, but it might have saved baseball from the embarrassment of having a team with a losing record in the playoffs.
"When you look back on our history, some people would say it was the beginning of the end for the Expos," Delorme said.
Thinking like the business executive he is, Delorme noted that a team that wins for the first time doesn't experience the economic impact immediately.
"If we had been in the post-season, it would have served as a stimulus for increased ticket sales the next year," he said. "The outcome would have been extremely positive in '95. Had we done well in the postseason, I think we would have been in position to go the same route in' 95. We suffered an extensive loss in '94. We lost 27 home games. That would have generated a lot of revenue for us. We could have kept some players we had to release."
Walker became a free agent after the season. After the strike ended the following April, the Expos traded Grissom, Wetteland and Hill.
"I think we could have easily kept two of the players had we played the season in full," Delorme said. "If we had won the World Series, ownership would have looked at things differently. You would have known the attendance would pick up, maybe get to 2.5, 2.7. If we had been able to keep two of the four, I think it would have made a huge difference."
Other players, however, soon followed Walker, Wetteland, Grissom and Hill. Most of them traded -- Martinez, Alou, Cliff Floyd, Rondell White, Jeff Fassero, Jeff Shaw, Kirk Rueter, Darrin Fletcher, Wil Cordero and Mike Lansing left in the next few seasons. 
The Expos haven't been the same since and might not be at all in the near future, potentially a belated victim of the 1994 labor dispute.

Twins Players Back Union
This year's Expos are probably too far out of the wild-card race to lament, if a strike should end the season prematurely, what might have been. But the Minnesota Twins, with a huge lead in the American League Central, could be this season's version of the 1994 Expos.
After the players set their strike date Friday, Denny Hocking, the Twins' player representative, was asked about the effect a work stoppage could have on the team. He said he had been asked that question numerous times, and he didn't think it was fair.
"It's like people think the Twins are being punished for playing good baseball the first four months," Hocking said. "We're probably the only team in the league being asked that question. We've done a tremendous job putting ourselves in this position. We've battled through contraction, and now we have to battle through a possible strike."
What Hocking found unfair was that people might think the Twins players are thinking only of themselves. The players, he said, fully support the union.
"As a team, we wouldn't like to experience a strike," he said. "We realize if there is a strike it could kill baseball in Minnesota, but you have to put aside your personal goals. This team has always agreed that come decision time we'll run in the right direction and the right direction at this time is for the future."
Hocking nevertheless remained hopeful that a deal could be reached. Recalling that he said throughout the winter the Twins would survive the owners' contraction scheme, he said, "I'm one for one. Hopefully I'm not a .500 hitter here."

Post-Strike Homer Surge
Conspiracy theorists might say it's no coincidence that after the 1994-95 strike, baseball sought a way to bring fans back to the ballparks and one way they did it was by enhancing the baseballs. But whatever the reason, the torrent of 50-home-run-plus seasons began immediately after the strike, when Albert Belle hit 50 home runs in 1995.
Before Belle's production -- in less than a 162-game season no less -- players had hit 50 or more home runs 18 times. Beginning with Belle, in just seven seasons, players have hit 50 or more home runs 16 times. Sixty or more? Twice before 1994, six times since, including Sammy Sosa an unprecedented three times in four seasons.
If this season is played to the end, Sosa, with 41 entering the weekend, has a chance to reach 60 a fourth time. From this point of the season to the end the three times he broke the 60 barrier, he hit 19, 16 and 21 home runs. 

Bonds Near Ruth's Feat
When Barry Bonds connected for his 600th on Aug. 9, he became the first player to reach 500 and 600 in successive seasons. Hitting 73 home runs last season, of course, helped him achieve that unprecedented feat. 
Bonds, entering the weekend, had hit 155 the last three seasons. Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, who preceded Bonds to 600, never hit that many home runs in a three-season span. Aaron's most productive three-season production was 129 in 1969-71. Mays hit 136 in 1964-66. Babe Ruth eclipsed Aaron and Mays with 161 in 1926-28. 
If the season goes beyond Aug. 30, Bonds should surpass Ruth's three-season total.
Bonds reached 600 in his 17th season. Aaron, Ruth and Mays each hit his 600th in his 18th season. Sammy Sosa is playing his 14th season and could get to 600 in his 16th season.

HEADLINE: Slavery Reparations Advocates Voice Demands in Washington 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 17 

 BODY:
Speakers told an energetic crowd on the National Mall today that blacks in the United States were owed compensation for two centuries of slavery and discrimination. 
 "We have to prepare a place for the young," said Louis Farrakhan, leader of the Nation of Islam, to the hundreds of people in the crowd. "There are babies out here on the Mall that deserve a better future." 
 Many reparations advocates argue that the government should provide individual payments and make a formal apology to blacks for the damage caused by the trans-Atlantic slave trade and its social and economic consequences. Others make a case for other compensation, like tax-exempt status.
In an interview, David Daniels, director of communications for Millions for Reparations, the Brooklyn-based group that organized the event, said in an interview that though there is debate about what form any payment should take, "there's a unified demand that a crime was committed and reparations are due now." 
City Councilman Charles Barron of Brooklyn, who represents East New York and Brownsville, was one of dozens of New Yorkers who attended the rally.
Representative John Conyers, a Democrat from Detroit, criticized other members of Congress for their lack of support for reparations. He has backed a bill that calls for a federal commission to examine slavery's impact and make recommendations for appropriate remedies. 
Mr. Conyers also said the United States walked out of the United Nations meeting on racism in Durban, South Africa, in September to avoid a discussion on reparations. (American officials said that language at the meeting about "the racist practices of Zionism" prompted the withdrawal.) 
Advocates equate their cause to that of Japanese-Americans sent to internment camps during World War II. President Ronald Reagan issued an official apology to Japanese-Americans in 1988 for the government's wrongdoing and approved $20,000 in reparations to each internee.
Philippe LeRoy and his wife, Marie-Francoise, of France, who happened upon the rally while strolling the Mall, shrugged at the idea of slavery reparations.
"All along history, there have been ugly things happening," said Ms. LeRoy, a high school teacher in Chartres. "But we have to keep moving."'

HEADLINE: A Precarious Life Goes From Bad to Worse 

BYLINE:  By WINNIE HU 

DATELINE: NEWBURGH, N.Y., Aug. 15 

 BODY:
Ava, a 40-year-old Mexican with a tired face, has worked at a cosmetics factory here for seven years, earning $7.75 an hour on an anonymous assembly line. But that may end soon, if her employer keeps checking her identity papers. 
 She has been warned twice in the past five months that her Social Security number was not valid, and each time, she has claimed that her lawyer was fixing the problem. In fact, her lawyer could offer no help because Ava used a fake number. "I'm just waiting to be told that I don't have a job anymore," she said. "It's very precarious." 
 So precarious that Ava's two oldest daughters have already lost their jobs because of the tighter security checks. In June, Maria was fired from a uniform cleaning company here, and a month later, Heidi was replaced in the dining hall at the United States Military Academy at West Point, where she had set tables for the cadets and washed dishes. 
Immigrants living illegally in this country have always faced uncertainty and hardship, but now many of them say that their lives have changed for the worse since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. They have lost longtime jobs as employers increasingly check identity papers, and even those who are not Arab or Muslim say they have encountered more suspicion from bosses, co-workers and neighbors.
"They're feeling more vulnerable," said Monica Santana, executive director of the Latino Workers Center, a nonprofit group in Manhattan that receives 100 calls a week from immigrants across the state in need of help, double the number from last year. "They're not only afraid of being found out, but also of being accused of being a terrorist."
Critics of illegal immigration are quick to point out that these immigrants do not have a legal right to live in this country. They say greater scrutiny can accomplish what immigration laws have generally failed to do -- make things so hard for illegal workers that they must return to their own countries. "People should not be able to come here and operate outside the law," said David Ray, associate director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a nonprofit group in Washington that has called for stricter enforcement of immigration laws. "Otherwise, we'll never get a handle on terrorism and illegal immigration."
As recently as last summer, a movement to grant legal rights to illegal Mexican immigrants with a history of working in the United States seemed to be gaining momentum largely because of negotiations between President Bush and President Vicente Fox of Mexico. But that stalled immediately after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks as the nation's focus shifted to the war on terrorism, and has only recently re-emerged. Last month, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri said he would propose legislation to let illegal immigrants with a work history in this country qualify for residency. But it is given little chance of passage this year.
The dual impact of terrorism and recession has spread to places like Newburgh, a hilltop city of grand Victorian homes, faded row houses and crumbling factories overlooking the Hudson River, where Hispanics make up more than one-third of the population of 28,259. The 2000 census lists 10,257 Hispanics, including 4,111 Mexicans and 3,069 Puerto Ricans, though many residents say those numbers are too low.
The illegal immigrants can be found across the city in factories, restaurants, construction and landscaping. Some come back at night to basement apartments, hidden from view, while others cram into dark, airless brownstones. They are most visible on Friday nights, when they cash their checks and pack into Mexican groceries and taco joints. 
The luckier ones may eventually become legal. Pablo Cruz, 52, a Mexican immigrant, received his green card through a 1986 amnesty program after years of operating bread-making machines in an Italian bakery. Now he organizes rallies to help the other illegal immigrants in Newburgh. "I suffered," he said. "I was there when immigration came around grabbing people. So now that I have my documents, my dream is that everyone has that."
For the most part, Newburgh has quietly absorbed this influx of immigrants without the outcry or protests that divided Farmingville, N.Y., and towns across California. But in the past year, concerns over terrorism have put many of these residents in a difficult position: they see the need for more security to uncover potential terrorists, but do not want to threaten the livelihood of their neighbors.
Elsa Figueroa App, a city councilwoman who was the first Hispanic to be elected to that office last year, said she planned to raise money and look for other ways to help the illegal immigrants caught in the fallout. "We want to help those that come in peace," she said. "And we will absolutely close the door on anyone who wants to come here to hurt us."
But, at times, that may be an impossible distinction to make. Alfredo Mazariego, 40, a farm worker from El Salvador who became a legal resident in nearby Plattekill, N.Y., just before Sept. 11, said he knew six Salvadorans who were recently fired in New York City because their boss had suspected them of anti-American activities. The men did not speak enough English to defend themselves. 
Federal immigration officials in the New York region say that they have not stepped up their work-site enforcement operations since Sept. 11. Under a 1986 federal law, an employer who knowingly hires an illegal immigrant can be subject to civil and criminal penalties, and the immigrant can be deported and barred from re-entering the country for up to 10 years.
What has changed, though, is that the Social Security Administration is notifying more employers of numbers that do not match the agency's records. Mark Lassiter, a spokesman for the agency, said that 750,000 letters would be sent to employers nationwide this year compared to 100,000 in previous years because of a policy decision made even before Sept. 11. The agency has also adopted stricter rules for issuing Social Security cards and taken other steps to prevent identity fraud, like verifying applicant information with local and state governments, and setting up an online system for employers to check Social Security numbers.
Some employers say they have decided on their own to enforce hiring policies more closely. For instance, after Sept. 11, the West Point military academy asked contractors to verify the Social Security numbers and immigration status of every employee who came into contact with the cadets. "It was always required before," said Lt. Col. Jim Whaley, a spokesman for the academy. "But what happened was there wasn't a 100 percent check of everyone. Now there is."
In Newburgh, the illegal immigrants have tried to cope with the tighter security and the slowing economy by changing jobs more often. They work until they get fired, then buy another fake card and start over. But many of them say their options are dwindling with every lost job.
Ava and her husband, Martiriano, who is 50 and works for a landscaping company, settled in Newburgh in 1990 after illegally crossing the border from Puebla, Mexico. They got their first jobs with fake identity papers costing $130 each, and later brought over their five children. 
In their small apartment, there is no air-conditioning, and the lights and the phone work only when they can afford to pay their bills. Still, this is now their home. "My life here, it's not that it's so great," Ava said. "But at least when you work, you can earn enough for a decent life and your children can go to school."

HEADLINE: Wider Scope In New Plans For Rebuilding 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
Plans for the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan, until now focused almost exclusively on the World Trade Center site, have for the first time expanded to encompass all of downtown, according to officials involved in the rebuilding process. 
 The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation hired one urban planning firm last week and is working with the Bloomberg administration to plan a search for other firms to help remake neighborhoods from Chinatown to Battery Park, rebuilding officials said. 
 Together, the city and the development corporation will undertake studies of specific geographic areas downtown and examinations of Lower Manhattan's needs for housing, commercial and retail space, parks and other open areas and improvements in pedestrian and automobile traffic.
In addition, city and state officials said last week that they were working on a plan to create an Empire Zone economic development district that would encompass much of Chinatown and portions of the Lower East Side. The Empire Zone program, begun by New York State in 1987, offers sales and property tax benefits to encourage businesses and new development. 
"We are working in conjunction with the development corporation and, in many ways, leading the effort to develop areas beyond the World Trade Center site itself," Daniel Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding, said Friday. 
"We haven't reached conclusions about what actions need to be taken," he said, "but from the city's perspective, we need to generate a much more holistic vision of the future of Lower Manhattan."
The first firm hired in the expanded rebuilding effort, Peterson Littenberg Architects & Planners, is a small New York partnership. Two of Peterson Littenberg's designs were included in the six plans for the trade center site that were presented to the public last month, including one relatively well-received design that included a promenade extending along West Street from the trade center site to Battery Park.
That work resulted from a $375,000 no-bid contract extended to the firm in May by the development corporation to work on designs for the trade center site. Last week, the development corporation extended Peterson Littenberg's contract by three months and asked it to begin a $165,000 study of the area south of Liberty Street and west of Broadway. 
The firm was hired in 1994 by the Battery Park City Authority to complete an urban design for Lower Manhattan. In those plans, the firm proposed an overhaul of the area south of the World Trade Center, creating new open spaces around which residences, restaurants, shops, hotels and cultural institutions could be built. One such square was designated for the area over the entrance to the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel.
A briefing paper on the newly approved contract, which was made available by a member of the development corporation's board, suggested that the firm would produce a plan similar to its work from 1994. 
Rebuilding officials said other firms would be sought through public requests for bidders by the development corporation or New York City. Those requests are likely to be announced within several weeks.
Members of the development corporation's board have pushed for the agency to begin addressing areas beyond the trade center site. The agency's original mandate included all areas south of Houston Street. 
Some board members have expressed frustration that the plans for the 16-acre trade center site have dominated the rebuilding process, to the detriment, they said, of the economic recovery of the broader downtown area. 
They have urged the development corporation's staff to make full use of its access to some $2 billion in federal rebuilding allocations and of its statutory powers, which includes the power to acquire property by condemnation.
"There's been a recognition that some of the planning so far has been taking place in a vacuum," said one development official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. For example, the official said, if a plan calls for Fulton Street to be extended westward to West Street, as several of the six initial plans did, that effort should be coordinated with planning for the part of Fulton Street east of Broadway. So far, it has not.
The trade center property is owned by a single governmental agency, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and most of the rest of Lower Manhattan is privately owned.
Mr. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor, is a fixture at the development corporation's board meetings, and he previously worked closely with Alexander Garvin, the development corporation's vice president for planning, design and development, in preparing the city's bid for the 2012 Olympics. Mr. Garvin worked with Peterson Littenberg as a consultant on the 1994 plan.
The work on broader planning issues has also included the Department of City Planning, which is overseen by Amanda Burden, the chairwoman of the City Planning Commission, who has spoken publicly about the need to coordinate the rebuilding at the trade center site with plans for all of downtown. 
The Department of Housing Preservation and Development has been involved in discussions about how to increase the available housing in Lower Manhattan.
"If you accept as a true fact that the trade center site can't be divorced from the rest of Lower Manhattan, then you'll see we have to move quickly," Mr. Doctoroff said. 
It was in order to move quickly that Louis R. Tomson, the development corporation president, said on Thursday that the agency's board needed to approve an extension of Peterson Littenberg's contract for planning services. 
Mr. Tomson described the extension of the no-bid contract as "an interim step to complete the work Peterson Littenberg has done so far and also to carry us through to when we can retain help in response to a request for proposals."
Those contracts, which Peterson Littenberg will be able to compete for, are expected to be awarded by November.

GRAPHIC: Chart/Map: "AT ISSUE: Old Ideas Revisited"Peterson Littenberg Architects, hired last week to begin studying areas of Lower Manhattan south of Liberty Street and west of Broadway, prepared a plan for Lower Manhattan in 1994 that contained some ideas that have gained support in the discussion over the trade center site. Its previous study included: 1) A tree-lined boulevard along West Street, similar to the memorial promenade in one of the six trade center site plans released in July. 2) A similar tree-lined boulevard along Water Street to Battery Park. 3) A new commuter railroad station in the Lower Manhattan business core. 4) New housing and small neighborhood parks at the center of Lower Manhattan, away from the waterfront.

 Sadly, I join the ranks of those troubled by David Sciarra's seeming capitulation to those who would turn their backs on the children in the Abbott schools ("The Newest Battle Over Poor Schools," cover, Aug. 11). 
 Two so-called reforms disturb me, both of which will use money that could go directly into classrooms. 
First, the concept of a database to track each student and to determine which schools and which teachers are "not performing adequately" misses the whole point. Schools are an integral part of society and reflect its problems. Guns, drugs, unemployment and underemployment, low wages, poor housing and malnutrition are some of those problems. Besides, a database already exists -- a result of state-mandated testing.
Second is the new Abbott Implementation and Compliance Coordinating Council, which sounds as though it will cover ground already covered in depth. We know what needs to be done; let's do it. 
And now that taxpayers are essentially financing two separate systems -- public schools and charter schools -- money will be in even shorter supply. Indeed, a state law was recently enacted enabling charter schools to use federal funds to construct buildings, even though the original state legislation said no charters would be given unless they already had their facilities.

Those Old-Time Shares Are Looking Good Again

BYLINE:  By DIANA B. HENRIQUES 

 BODY:
HERE'S an investment strategy of the moment: Never trust any company under 30.
 As the scandals accumulate -- Enron, Worldcom, Global Crossing, Imclone -- business historians have been struck by how young some of today's corporate delinquents are. All four are less than 20 years old, and Global Crossing, born in 1997, is barely out of kindergarten. 
 A long history is no vaccine against misbehavior, of course. Adelphia Communications has been around since the early 1950's, and it recently filed for bankruptcy. In June, Arthur Andersen, almost 90 years old, was convicted of obstruction of justice. And in 1995, a rogue trader brought down mighty Baring Brothers, the British investment bank that had been around for more than 230 years. 
But when today's scandals are added to the recent collapse of so many newborn Internet stocks, companies that measure their history in generations, not product cycles, suddenly seem a bit more intriguing, not to mention alluring. 
"I think a lot of people learned their lessons with the dot-coms," said David Powell, executive vice president at 3M, which marked its 100th birthday in June. "We have seen a considerable increase in interest among investors and potential employees, who say they want to be with a company that's going to be around for the next hundred years."
Dozens of major American companies -- and scads of small ones -- have demonstrated that kind of longevity. There are about a hundred of them on the membership rolls of the Hundred Year Association in New York, a public service organization formed in 1927 to recognize longstanding fixtures of the New York economy. These include Tiffany (1837), Pfizer (1849), Consolidated Edison (1881) and Hearst (1887). Bowne & Company, a leading provider of financial printing and information management services, set up shop in Manhattan in 1775.
"To try to identify reasons for longevity among them is difficult," said Richard A. Cook, the association's president, who noted that many of the older companies are the product of mergers or restructurings. "But those that are family controlled seem different -- they tended to continue in the basic business line, while adapting successfully to change over time."
Wells Fargo marked its 150th anniversary earlier this year with an exhibition at the Museum of American Financial History in Manhattan, which continues through Sept. 14. Brian C. Thompson, the Museum's executive director, says Wells Fargo's corporate historians found that the company was "one of only about a dozen American companies to reach 150 years of continuous operation under its original name and still in its founding business."
Others in that elite club include DuPont, which marks its bicentennial this year, Colgate-Palmolive (1806), Procter & Gamble (1837) and The New York Times Company (1851).
And every year brings a fresh crop of companies reaching the century mark. Besides 3M, J. C. Penney also turns 100 this year. So does Navistar International, known through most of its life as International Harvester, which marked its birthday last week by having its chairman, John R. Horne, ring the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange.
Next year, Kraft Foods, Ford Motor and Harley-Davidson will all hit 100, although Harley-Davidson's yearlong celebration began with biker rallies last month. 
Is it simply age-bias in reverse to favor companies with this kind of staying power? Maybe not.
Several business historians have noticed that the companies caught up in these recent scandals were dominated by their top executives in ways that would be very difficult to achieve at a more venerable organization, where chief executives typically serve for a decade or less. 
"A longstanding company has usually developed a corporate culture that restrains an aggressive C.E.O. from getting out of control," said Richard Sylla, a business historian and the chairman of the economics department at New York University's Stern School of Business. "This is especially true if the old firm has continued to do its core business -- the old-line oil companies, for example."
And while the executives who make it into the corner offices at these century-plus companies probably are not plagued by low self-esteem, few of them entertain the notion that the company owes its very existence to their own talents, an attitude that might encourage a certain arrogance in dealing with the fine points of accounting.
Indeed, the egos of some of today's entrepreneurial chief executives contrast sharply with that of James Cash Penney, who put his name on the retailing chain that was born with the opening of his Golden Rule Store in 1902 in Kemmerer, Wyo. In 1952, when his company marked its 50th anniversary, he observed: "I am not inclined to think of the Penney Company as a creation of mine. It is bigger than anything that I could ever create or be."

HEADLINE: Miss America Teeters Toward Another Pageant 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT STRAUSS 

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY 

 BODY:
AS this seaside town slouches toward another Labor Day, attention here is perceptibly turning to its own form of reality-based television, the Miss America Pageant, though some weeks it more closely resembles "Survivor."
 It is more than a coincidence that the senior vice president of alternative series and specials at ABC-TV, Andrea Wong, who oversees the network's reality shows, will deal with the pageant as well. 
 The truth is, the litany of troubles that has beset the 81-year-old beauty pageant turned quest for relevance -- though not too much relevance -- would make Bert Parks bury his head in an issue of Penthouse.
In the past year, even the pageant's very existence as part of Atlantic City's social and cultural fabric has been put up for sale to the highest bidder, though those close to the event insist it will not be taken to another casino town. The official line: the matter has been tabled until this year's winner is crowned. 
The truth is, few people here want to see the Miss America Pageant -- an event that defined the city long before one-armed bandits showed up (in the casinos, anyway) -- go to the highest bidder in Nevada, Florida, California or Connecticut.
"From the standpoint of people who live down here, Miss America is an important event," said Michael Pollock, the editor and publisher of Gaming Industry Observer, a trade magazine published in nearby Northfield. "You can't quantify it, but it puts Atlantic City on the map."
Still, what a dizzying year it has been for the queen of pageants.
Just last September, pageant officials and contestants -- after agonizing for days -- made the risky decision to go on with the nationally televised show just days after hijacked jetliners slammed into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.
Months later, Robert M. Renneisen Jr., the pageant's chief executive and the third boss in four years, threatened to take the competition elsewhere unless the Atlantic City Convention and Visitors Authority anted up another $1 million a year for the money-losing event.
Before Mr. Renneisen, a former casino executive, finally walked out the revolving door and away from his $250,000-a-year salary, he solicited new sponsors and licensed Miss America slot machines and other merchandise to resurrect the pageant's sagging finances. That went over about as big as a thong in the bathing suit competition.
Nor was that the end of it. Mr. Renneisen's final walk down the runway and out the door did not come before an eight-page rocket was delivered from the parents of the reigning Miss America, Katie Harmon, complaining about their treatment at the hands of pageant officials, saying that their daughter was not getting enough bookings, that the pageant was short-changing them on bills for her clothing alterations and that the organization had the nerve to bill them for a post-crowning party at the Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort.
That was it.
In March, Mr. Renneisen became the latest pageant casualty when he was forced to resign after a two-year tenure, becoming the second consecutive chief executive to fail to serve out his contract. For now, his second-in-command, George Bauer, is running the extravaganza, and he quickly jettisoned two vice presidents in a money-saving gesture.
If it all seems like a roller coaster ride on the old Million Dollar Pier, there was one more little twist last month. Miss North Carolina relinquished her crown after a former fiance threatened to publicize nude photographs of her that he had taken.
Still, with the same glued-on smile that is as much a part of the Miss America Pageant as hair spray and stiletto heels, upbeat seems to reign in this beleaguered city when it comes to talking about its favorite daughter, Miss America.
"It is certainly good for the overall economy and for small businesses here in general," said Ernest Coursey, an aide to Mayor Lorenzo Langford. "Where else would you put Miss America but in her hometown? This is it. There is no other place for it."
Yet as it stumbles into another season, the Miss America pageant is grappling more than ever with a mixed identity. It is part homespun -- after all, its origins were a way to keep the beach season going beyond Labor Day by local businesspeople. And for decades it has it depended on local matrons who have chaperoned the teenage queens to their appointed make-up sessions and photo shoots.
But it is also a corporate entity with a chief executive, a multimillion-dollar budget and a spiderlike national reach. And it is international in the sense that it is a pawn of ABC, which makes it one more in the pantheon of events broadcast to dozens of countries around the world.
"Yes, look, it is hard to deny the part of Miss America that is a television event," said Mr. Bauer. "Within 10 days of being appointed March 1, I went out to California and talked to the production people for this year's show. We have a very synergistic relationship with ABC."
Those television synergies are undeniable. For instance, in past years, the host was much less a part of the hype and more a part of the institution. For 25 years -- from 1965 to 1980 -- Mr. Parks sang "There She Is" while the departing Miss America crowned her successor. But since he was unceremoniously dumped, there has been a succession of personalities like Regis Philbin and Kathie Lee Gifford and such lesser lights as Tony Danza; the ABC soap opera stars John Callahan and Eva LaRue Callahan; Boomer Esiason; the talk show host Meredith Vieira; and Donny and Marie Osmond.
This year, the host of the television show will be Wayne Brady, a likeable enough comic. The big news, of course, is that Mr. Brady will be the first black person to serve as host of the pageant show. But the real news is that Mr. Brady, a star of "Whose Line Is It Anyway?" a comedy show now in its fifth season on ABC, will star in his own show this season, and ABC is disposed to shine a spotlight on him this year.
Last year's pageant got bigger ratings than the previous 39 Saturday nights, said Ms. Wong of ABC. "It gets a pretty broad audience: families with kids, women with daughters. It does skew female," she said.
Though the 8.6 million homes that saw the telecast in each of the last two years is down considerably from the 20 million that watched in the 1970's before the flood of cable channels, it is still a significant audience for network television on a Saturday night.
Although Miss America has become more a showcase for ABC and its parent company, Walt Disney, many insist that it is less about ABC than Atlantic City.
As Mr. Pollock of the Gaming Industry Observer put it: "I would suggest you can't value it in that way. To those who live and work here, it is something that defines the place. It is what turns Atlantic City into something other than just a place with casinos."
And Ms. Wong said that ABC had no vested interest in whether the pageant stayed in Atlantic City, nor did the network have any say in the matter.
For now, the issue of keeping Miss America in Atlantic City is far from settled. For decades, the pageant was run -- tight-lipped and iron-fisted -- by a local stockbroker, Albert Marks Jr. and his successor, Leonard Horn, a home-grown attorney. In those years, there was no question that the pageant was Atlantic City's own, and pageant offices around the country cleaved to whatever Mr. Marks and Mr. Horn decided. Mr. Horn did once make a gesture toward sending the show to Disney World in Orlando to shake things up, but few took him seriously.
But in 1998 when Mr. Horn retired, the Miss America Organization board -- composed of 21 unpaid members -- decided to go less parochial and more corporate when it turned to Robert Beck, a Chicago lawyer who had run the United States Soccer Association.
It was then that the wheels began coming off.
During Mr. Beck's yearlong abbreviated tenure, he embarrassed the pageant by eschewing a 50-year-old rule and decreeing that women who had been divorced or who had had abortions should be allowed to enter the annual contest. It hardly conjured up what Mr. Parks tunefully described as that "all-American face and form." He was quickly shown the trap door.
Enter Mr. Renneisen, a former chief executive of the Claridge Hotel-Casino, who met a similar fate, to be succeeded by Mr. Bauer who so far has kept a decidedly lower profile. Indeed, his primary work has been behind the scenes, working with a task force whose main mission has been to find out what the Miss America Organization will need to keep the show in Atlantic City.
Mr. Renneisen had entertained several other offers, most prominently the Mohegan Sun casino in Uncasville, Conn., and the MGM Casino-Hotel in Las Vegas. He claimed they offered Miss America millions of dollars to move the pageant -- if not the $40-million-a-year scholarship machine -- to their stage.
"This seemed to be the first time a real offer was on the table to move, and so the community really mobilized," said Jeffrey Vasser, the executive director of the Atlantic City Convention and Visitors Authority. Mr. Renneisen had demanded at least $1 million in concessions, improvements and possibly even money up front for the pageant to stay in Atlantic City, giving the community task force a one-year deadline to come up with an alternative.
So far, Mr. Bauer has remained silent about the possible move, but he said he was eagerly awaiting a report from the task force, expected later this month.
"The board won't make any decision until well after the pageant in the fall," Mr. Bauer said. "But I will say this: the task force and the organization have been working well together, and I see that there will be impressive results."
Adding to his optimism is the fact that Boardwalk Hall, long the home of the pageant, has put on several big shows in the last year, particularly those of Britney Spears and Cher.
"As beautiful as it was, Boardwalk Hall was really not ready for the pageant last year," Mr. Bauer said of the $90 million renovation of the former Atlantic City Convention Hall. "Last year's Miss America Pageant was the first major event after the renovation. Things were being used for the first time. Now crews are practiced in loading and unloading a show. That's a time savings that translates into money. Plus, there is more equipment in there for us to use, which means we won't have to rent it like we did last year."
The practical translation is this: as time has passed, the likelihood of moving Miss America from Atlantic City seems to have lessened. The monetary return the organization might get from going to Connecticut or Las Vegas might very well be offset by the effect of leaving the embrace of its longtime home.
"In Las Vegas, Miss America would be just another event," said Ruth Ann Stewart, a professor at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University who specializes in how cultural institutions affect their communities. "The value of all that history is worth something. Whether you are Miss New York or Miss Potato Spud, you are working all year to get to Atlantic City, where other Miss Americas have been crowned. It has been broadcast around the world for years and it gives a resonance beyond the size and lack of prosperity of the current Atlantic City.
"Miss America may well be the only major cultural or sports event, save for the Academy Awards, that is so identified with its place of origin," Ms. Stewart added. "The World Series and Super Bowl change location every year. Conventions rotate cities. Even the Grammy Awards have gone from coast to coast."
For now, Atlantic City is holding its collective breath, secure in the knowledge that a newly crowned Miss America will walk down the runway near midnight on Sept. 22 this year, and hoping that the victory lap will be repeated for years to come.
"You have people from Iowa and Utah coming here and saying to their friends when they return, 'Gee, my daughter may not have won, but we had a great time in Atlantic City,' " said Mr. Vasser of the visitors bureau. "We can't deny that it is a television event, not just something local for us. But even in that, it is in our interest to keep Miss America here at home."

Plumping a Career By Writing a Book

BYLINE:  By AMY ZIPKIN 

 BODY:
NOBODY will say Michael P. Cangemi's book is a page turner after reading its opening sentence.
 "It is the goal of this manual to assist you in developing your auditing function into a well-respected contributor to the company's mission," it states. But Mr. Cangemi, 53, chief executive of the Aigner Group, says the book, written nine years ago and titled "Managing the Audit Function: A Corporate Audit Department Procedures Guide" (John Wiley & Sons), has given his company a business boost. His company, in Edison, N.J., sells leather accessories under the Etienne Aigner brand. 
 Mr. Cangemi worked on the book for 15 months, even scribbling away during his son's soccer practices. He said that being an author had won him respect at business meetings and has given his company added credibility.
"People look at you differently when you tell them you wrote a business book," he said. Though it has sold only 3,000 copies, he believes Etienne Aigner gets better financing terms because of his perceived expertise in corporate governance. 
John F. Welch Jr. may be making much more money from his management blockbuster, "Jack: Straight From the Gut," but thousands of lesser-known business executives are also taking the path of sharing their wisdom with the business world through books. In the process, many of the authors hope to reap modest fame, if not fortune. Publishing often leads to speaking engagements, increased visibility within a company and, more recently, additional income from electronic publishing rights.
Just about anybody, it seems, can try to take the plunge. Nearly 27,000 business books were published from 1995 to 2000, with annual sales rising to $1 billion from $617 million, according to the Book Industry Study Group, a trade association in Matawan, N.J., that gathers industry data. Most of the authors were executives who were new to publishing.
But many more people fail when they try to have major publishers print their books. Wiley & Sons says it receives about 1,000 proposals annually but publishes only 100 to 200 business books. McGraw-Hill says that it gets 1,500 to 2,000 queries but that only 200 result in published titles.
"It's a tremendous positive asset to have published a book," said James M. Citrin, co-leader of the global technology, communications and media practice at Spencer Stuart, the executive search firm.
The actual writing of a book, however, has drawbacks for executives, experts say. It can divert time from running a company and prompt criticism that the author is neglecting work to embark on an ego trip.
There are other risks, too. If their books link writers too closely with fads that fall out of favor, like Internet start-ups, their careers can stall. And bad reviews -- if the book is reviewed at all -- can cause the most pain. 
That said, executives who have written books generally report that the exercise was rewarding. Nancy Tennant Snyder, 45, vice president for leadership and strategic competency creation at the Whirlpool Corporation, based in Benton Harbor, Mich., said she had been seeking intellectual stimulation when she wrote "Mastering Virtual Teams: Strategies, Tools and Techniques" (Jossey-Bass, 1998) with Deborah L. Duarte as co-author. Ms. Snyder said she had read Steven King for style pointers, adopting literary devices like an alter-ego manager named Sara, who blundered while directing her team.
But writing the book gave Ms. Snyder more than a mental workout. Previously, whenever she started a project, her first inclination was to seek the advice of a fellow executive or outside consultant. Now, she writes down her thoughts first, sometimes spending 10 or 15 hours composing a detailed plan of action. 
Ms. Snyder has become such a believer in putting thoughts on paper that she requires subordinates to write an article on some business topic and try to have it published; their success in doing this is a consideration in performance reviews. 
The real objective, she said, is to make them think more clearly.
The strategy hasn't completely converted her higher-ups. While supporting her effort, David R. Whitwam, Whirlpool's chief executive, said he didn't take book authorship into consideration in hiring or promoting executives.
BUT other executives say writing has helped them climb the corporate ladder. Paul M. Cole, recently promoted to director of global sales at Cap Gemini Ernst & Young, the consulting firm, said his book, "Customer Connections: New Strategies for Growth" (Harvard Business School Press, 1997), written with Robert E. Wayland, had helped earn him early visibility and put him in play for a series of promotions at Ernst & Young.
Mr. Cole, 43, wrote the book on company time, giving Ernst & Young the copyright. Even before the book was published, his bosses were so impressed that they created a formal practice that took its name from the book -- and they made Mr. Cole its leader. He soon began receiving invitations to speak at management and economics conferences. 
Three years after publication, Mr. Cole was still getting leverage from the book. A business trip to Asia in 2000 to meet with clients turned into a de facto book tour as clients lined up for autographed copies. He continues to be interviewed by analysts and journalists because, he said, he is "viewed as a thought leader as well as a practice manager."
Not that he thinks his fame will last forever. "People want to know the next new hot thing," he said.
Mr. Cangemi of the Aigner Group, meanwhile, has donated a collection of almost 300 books, including his own -- virtually every book on information systems auditing published in the last two decades -- to the University of Mississippi.
He has also established children's reading corners in many of his company's stores. There, however, "Managing the Audit Function: A Corporate Audit Department Procedures Guide" is not a featured selection.

HEADLINE: Why Isn't Fast Track . . . Faster? 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
IT was early June, five weeks after Congress passed one of the biggest reversals to free trade in decades: a measure to provide more than $100 billion in subsidies to American farmers over the next 10 years.
 The move provoked angry protests from around the world, particularly from poorer countries that rely heavily on farm exports. 
 Yet in Geneva, home of the World Trade Organization, America's biggest farm groups spent two days lobbying diplomats from South America, Africa, Asia and Europe to cut their subsidies and open their markets to more American products.
"They were all very nice," one European trade diplomat recalled. "But we just kept thinking, what are they coming here for?" 
The moment foreshadowed the awkward situation that now confronts President Bush. This month, he won a hard-fought battle when Congress narrowly approved a bill that gives the administration "fast track" authority to forge big agreements to lower trade barriers. The law prohibits Congress from tinkering with the deals -- it can only ratify or reject them -- and most trade experts say it is essential for establishing American negotiating credibility.
Already, the administration is moving on several fronts. Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, is close to finishing free-trade agreements with Chile and Singapore. He is accelerating talks on a "Free Trade Agreement for the Americas" that would expand the existing North American free-trade area to all of Latin America. He is gearing up for global trade talks aimed at a worldwide reduction in barriers in agriculture, financial services, transportation and manufacturing.
"Our game plan has been to create a competition in liberalization," Mr. Zoellick said in an interview on Thursday. If Chile and Central American nations enter a free-trade pact with the United States, he argues, the rest of South America will feel pressure as well. And if they do, so will the rest of the world.
The trouble is, the United States has created more problems by its own recent backsliding. By drastically increasing subsidies, the new farm bill has strengthened protectionist forces in Europe, where subsidies are much higher.
In Brazil, South America's biggest economy, leaders are angry about the American refusal to lower barriers on sugar, corn, orange juice and textiles. Brazilian officials also say they are considering filing a legal complaint about American barriers to cotton imports.
And last spring, the Bush administration infuriated leaders from Germany to South Korea by imposing steep new tariffs on foreign steel. The European Union has threatened to fight back with new tariffs against American products and has already filed legal complaints at the World Trade Organization.
"We have dug ourselves into a hole, and now we have to climb out of it," said Gerald P. O'Driscoll, who follows international trade at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative policy group.
THE faster, the better, trade proponents say. The United States, one of the world's most open economies, generally benefits from an expansion in global trade.
Since the beginning of 2001, the United States and the rest of the world have been struggling to revive their slumping economies. Increased trade would undoubtedly help, though the benefits of new trade agreements would still be a few years away.
"There is no doubt in my mind that trade agreements benefit not only the United States but also its trading partners," said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at DRI-WEFA, an economic forecasting firm in Waltham, Mass. "We need this," he added. "There is no doubt that the export sectors are among the most dynamic sectors of the economy."
The United States has, by far, the largest trade deficit of any country, $358 billion for goods and services last year. The trade talks will focus on two areas where the United States has particularly large opportunities to bolster exports: agriculture and services.
The United States exports more than $50 billion a year in farm products, and agriculture is one of the few areas in which it has a big trade surplus. American farm subsidies, even now, are only about one-third those of Europe. That means American farm products would have more of an edge if there is widespread reduction in tariffs and subsidies.
In services, from airlines to accounting, engineering and finance, the United States already exports $266 billion annually and had a trade surplus last year of $73 billion.
Even in manufactured goods, tariffs -- while comparatively low -- are still substantial in many countries and a barrier to American manufacturers.
For American companies to gain access to all those markets, Mr. Zoellick will have to be ready to make big concessions.
Supporters of the Bush administration, and even some foreign trade diplomats, say the president needed to compromise his free-trade instincts on both farm products and steel to win passage of fast track, known officially as Trade Promotion Authority. No country wants to waste time hammering out an agreement only to be forced to negotiate again with Congress.
"The passage of T.P.A. was essential," said Matthew Baldwin, a senior policy adviser to Pascal Lamy, the European Union's top trade negotiator, referring to fast-track authority.
BUT many trade experts wonder whether President Bush paid too high a price to pacify protectionists. Even if other nations go along with new market-opening agreements, they worry that Congressional opponents showed so much muscle that Mr. Zoellick will be too timid to offer proposals on anything politically sensitive. 
"Their political room is far less than their statutory room," said Gary Hufbauer, a veteran trade analyst at the Institute for International Economics in Washington. "They must recognize that they can't run very far and hope to get the thing enacted into law."
It is hard to overstate the widespread unease about free-trade deals. Labor unions complain that American companies simply move jobs to low-wage countries. Textile manufacturers, steel producers and farmers complain of a flood of imports from countries in which labor protection and environmental standards are low or nonexistent. Small wonder that the House of Representatives passed the fast-track authority by only three votes.
American exports have nearly doubled during the last decade, but imports have climbed even faster. The United States has trade deficits in industrial machinery, computers and many, if not most, areas of manufacturing.
But most economists believe the United States would be a net beneficiary from broad reductions in trade barriers, if only because American restrictions are, on average, lower than those elsewhere.
Mr. Zoellick says he is ready to plunge ahead, undeterred by criticism from other countries.
The strategy boils down to striking free-trade deals with favored individual countries like Chile by the end of this year. Then he plans to open free-trade talks with five Central American countries and four countries in southern Africa. If all goes as planned, that would put pressure on South American countries to move ahead on a hemispheric free-trade agreement by the start of 2005. 
Those talks would be parallel to the global trade talks that were started at Doha, Qatar, last November, which are also supposed to be completed by Jan. 1, 2005.
AS the global trade talks begin, the European Union will be both an ally and an adversary of the United States. American negotiators will push for much deeper reductions in farm barriers than Europe, particularly France, will want to offer. But the two are likely to have more allied interests in reducing global barriers to services and manufactured goods, because both the European and American markets in those areas are comparatively open.
China, with its huge and fast-growing economy, will be under heavy pressure to make good on the market-opening promises it made to gain membership in the World Trade Organization.
To demonstrate his seriousness in the global talks, Mr. Zoellick recently unveiled an ambitious proposal to cut agricultural barriers. The plan calls for reducing the global average for farm tariffs to 15 percent from 62 percent and limiting farm subsidies to 5 percent of a country's agricultural production. In effect, the plan would cut American subsidies from $19 billion to about $10 billion a year, a reduction that is a bit more than the subsidies that the new farm bill provided.
But the plan has met with a chilly reception in Europe, mainly because the United States would be reducing its barriers much less than most other countries. While annual American farm subsidies would fall by almost half, by Mr. Zoellick's estimate, European Union subsidies would drop by about 80 percent, to $12 billion from $60 billion.
"I do not see these proposals as a basis for compromise," said Franz Fischler, the European Union's commissioner for agriculture, denouncing the plan as "unbalanced."
American officials and American farm groups, which back the proposal, say it would simply force the biggest reductions in countries that have the biggest protection.
"This is a totally defensible position," Mr. Zoellick said. "Is it wrong to say that those who provide more support should also cut more?"
Mr. Zoellick faces even bigger potential opposition in Brazil, which imports about $15 billion a year of goods from the United States. Brazil's president, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, has repeatedly warned that Brazil will not be part of a pan-American free-trade pact if the United States does not offer more access to Brazilian products. 
"Brazil has been negotiating in earnest," said Rubens Barbosa, Brazil's ambassador in Washington. "The problem is that so far we don't see how we could get a balanced result. When we see the U.S. retaliation in steel, and when we see the farm bill increasing subsidies, we are concerned. Brazil, like most other countries, will not rush to accept anything."
Brazil, however, maintains tariffs of more than 30 percent on cars, many types of machinery and telecommunications equipment. Trade experts say it also keeps scores of nontariff barriers, generally regulations intended to keep out imports.
But Brazilians, knowing that their population of more than 172 million offers big opportunities to American exporters, complain they are being kept out of a long list of American markets. American sugar quotas, for example, keep foreign producers from exporting more than 1.1 million tons in total to the United States each year, about 10 percent of American consumption. The price of sugar is about 17 cents a pound in the United States, compared with about 5 cents in the world market.
Brazilian leaders also complain about tariffs on orange juice, which amount to nearly 40 percent of the selling price. The duties protect citrus farmers in Florida and California.
European leaders have been actively making overtures to Latin American countries. On Aug. 8, the European Union reached a preliminary agreement with Brazil to cut restrictions on textile trade in both directions, and it is pursuing its own plan to form a free-trade area with Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay. The European Union also has free-trade pacts with South Africa and many other countries.
"At this point, the Europeans seem to be ahead of us a bit," said Scott Ottoman, a lobbyist for the National Association of Manufacturers.
But Mr. Zoellick's bigger problems will be in meeting other countries' demands to roll back American anti-dumping rules and other tools to block certain imports.
The anti-dumping rules, which allow the government to impose extra tariffs on goods being imported at below the real cost, have been used almost exclusively to restrict steel imports.
Developing countries have been adamant that these rules be on the table at the coming global trade talks, but the rules enjoy powerful support in Congress. Lawmakers in the House of Representatives tried unsuccessfully to insert a prohibition against even discussing the issue in the fast-track bill, but they succeeded in passing a provision against negotiating any deal that "weakens" American trade laws.
Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative in the Clinton administration, is worried that Congressional opponents of big trade deals will veto any agreement that seriously tampers with the anti-dumping provisions and other "trade remedies."
"The people who lost this fight by one or two votes, they won't let go of this issue," Ms. Barshefsky said last week. "If the administration comes back with weak anti-dumping laws, Congress will kiss that agreement good-bye."
Since it was formed in 1995, the World Trade Organization has ruled against the United States in almost every anti-dumping case it has reviewed. Just this month, W.T.O. dispute panels rejected two cases that involved penalties against formerly government-owned steel companies.
Most experts predict that the World Trade Organization, which serves as an international court to settle disputes, will reject the stiff duties Mr. Bush imposed this spring on steel. Mr. Bush imposed the tariffs as "safeguards," which are permitted under existing trade agreements when countries are confronted with a devastating flood of imports.
That's a hard case to support. Steel imports have been declining for the last several years. Though nobody disputes that American steel companies are in dire straits, with nearly one-third in bankruptcy, foreign rivals argue that the problems lie with the American industry's failure to restructure and deal with huge pension costs.
Despite the complaints, most countries are desperate to gain greater access to the giant American market. Mr. Bush may have sullied his free-trade credentials when he capitulated to steel producers and farm groups, but many foreign diplomats say they have no choice but to keep seeking the best deal they can get.
As one diplomat in Geneva put it: "We don't like what they did on steel, and we don't like the farm bill, but we just have to deal with it."

HEADLINE: The Nation: Flights of Fancy; 
Look to Your Feet and TV to Find the Future of Air Travel

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WONG 

 BODY:
"THE world has changed." Those words were used Wednesday by John W. Creighton Jr., the chief executive of United Airlines, to explain the downtrodden state of the American airline industry. What he should have said was the way people want to travel around the world has changed.
 The turbulence that shook up the industry last week signals another turning point in the short-lived history of the major airlines. The fallout of the Sept. 11 attacks accelerated a Darwinian progression that has been weeding out the winged mastodons since deregulation in 1978. Now, the giants that remain are being forced to face the fact that it is impossible to follow the quixotic flight path of being all things to all passengers and still turn a profit. 
 Major airlines in the future could start regularly offering niche products, with flights targeted to specific demographics, and ticket pricing simplified so that passengers know exactly what they are getting for what they pay. Niche marketing has been the hot selling concept for at least a decade, so why not apply it to airlines? On one end, there would exist the pared-down utilitarian service of Southwest Airlines and its imitators, often likened to cattle cars; and on the other would be flights geared for business travelers and other passengers used to being pampered. Midwest Express, based in Milwaukee, has always offered first-class service throughout the plane, and Lufthansa recently started a similar experiment on a trans-Atlantic route.
There are many industries where niche marketing has brought in huge revenues. Cable channels have proliferated and flourished because each one targets a specific audience -- no one confuses MTV, VH1 and BET, for example. More and more sneakers are being rolled out for different kinds of sports, from running to basketball to mountain biking to tennis. Few products promise to do all things.
Airlines are only now discovering that successful carriers simply cannot fly everywhere, give passengers the fastest travel time possible and provide amenities that will satisfy everyone, from the Sultan of Brunei to the student on spring break.
Evidence of full-service airlines awaking to that fact came in pessimistic bursts throughout last week. US Airways filed for bankruptcy protection. American Airlines, the world's largest carrier, said it was laying off 7,000 workers and streamlining its operations. United Airlines, the nation's second-largest carrier, said that it also may have to seek bankruptcy protection.
Those announcements portend a radical reinvention of the industry. Full-service airlines are retooling in the direction of no-frills carriers, in an effort to cut costs. American, for example, is offering bag lunches rather than hot meals on almost all domestic flights, trying to turn its planes around more quickly and cutting first-class cabins on flights to Hawaii, Latin America and some European cities.
Given that American is the industry's 800-pound gorilla, other full-service carriers will be asking themselves whether they should follow. The old amenities might then disappear from the industry, and "full-service" become a misnomer. The danger for such airlines is that their products might become so diluted that they no longer differentiate themselves and satisfy any niches.
"People say it's all one commodity, but it really isn't," said Michael Boyd, president of the Boyd Group, an airline consulting firm in Evergreen, Colo. "Airlines are a lot like hotels. You don't want to confuse the brand. That's why you have Marriott, and for a lower price you might have Courtyard by Marriott. But the brands are different."
Southwest Airlines and its profitable no-frills brethren -- including Ryanair, EasyJet and others across the Atlantic -- have shown that niche marketing can work with great success in the airline business.
From its start 31 years ago, Southwest set out to fill a niche. It eschewed the grand travel experience promised by airlines like the now defunct Pan American World Airways, placing its money on travelers who put practicality as their top priority. Those are people who want to get from point A to point B and don't care how they do it, as long as the ticket is cheap and the plane gets there on time. In such a philosophy, the question of "beef or chicken?" is as academic as whether green men exist on Mars.
"What's happened is that there is a market segment that values price over additional features," said John A. Quelch, a professor of marketing at Harvard Business School who sits on the board of EasyJet, based in London. "The major airlines competed really by adding benefits over the years. Their proposition has been, 'We have something more over what other guys are offering.' The niche value airlines have been able to come under that pricing umbrella. They have identified consumers not interested in additional frills."
In many cases, the low-cost airlines created a new market, by selling to people who would never have flown because of high prices. During economic downturns, their niche expands because cash-strapped passengers used to flying full-service airlines, including business travelers, defect to them.
In June, Lufthansa unveiled a service targeted at the opposite end of the spectrum. It started a daily flight between Newark, N.J., and Dusseldorf that consists entirely of business class luxuries, with only 48 seats in a Boeing 737-700. Passengers get catered food, personal video-cassette players and the attention of four flight attendants. The idea sounded dubious, and it is still too early to judge its long-term prospects, but a Lufthansa spokeswoman said the company is making money on the flight.
That kind of service, along with the rising popularity of low-cost carriers, foreshadows a possible two-tiered future for short- and medium-haul air travel, in which airlines sharply split their products. Airlines like Continental, Delta and US Airways have tried running separate no-frills carriers, but those generally failed because of branding problems or because the operations were tied too close to the main business.
In Europe, some airlines like KLM have done a better job of creating separate low-cost operations, partly because they brand them well and target the products at the appropriate market segment. No one confuses Buzz, KLM's low-cost carrier, with the parent company. Delta hinted two weeks ago that it could be rolling out a new low-cost airline by next year.
Creating niche products could also help simplify the complex airfare structure. The average traveler understands ticket pricing about as well as he or she knows how to pull a plane out of a tailspin. But with flights targeted to specific market segments, airlines would have to price to those demographics rather than offering dozens of fare types for a single flight.
Making money off niche markets works, though, only if there are enough consumers in those segments to offset operating costs. It is easy to envision a luxury-oriented airline failing because of lack of demand. As Steven A. Morrison, a professor of economics at Northeastern University, observed, "People say a seat is a seat." How much comfort do travelers really want, other than more room to stretch their legs?

HEADLINE: The World: Market Fallout; 
Which Party Will Take a Hit on Election Day?

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
ON the way up, the stock market promised, among other things, to reshape the political and policy landscape. 
 With stock ownership having spread to more than half of all households and a big majority of voters, and with the value of 401(k) accounts swelling by the day, both parties saw big opportunities. For Republicans, it was a chance to draw into the fold a new investor class, one that would presumably come to embrace conservative free-market policies. For Democrats, the steep rise in share prices at the end of the last decade, when they occupied the White House, offered hope of shedding their reputation as antibusiness and poor economic stewards. 
 On the way down, the market is also scrambling politics, but not in the way either party had hoped. 
Republicans, being the party now in power and the one more closely associated with both Wall Street and big business, clearly have more at risk. Instead of embracing conservative ideology, voter-investors are somewhere between jittery and angry. And because the economy's travails have been so closely associated with Wall Street's tumble, their reaction threatens to be bad news for Republicans on the ballot this November as well as for President Bush, who sought to reassure the electorate with a choreographed economic "summit" last week.
"Republicans thought the investor class would be their savior," said Marshall Wittmann, a fellow at the Hudson Institute, a conservative research group. "Instead, it's becoming the bane of their existence."
But the market's swoon holds peril for Democrats as well. If it continues, it could recast the boom of the 1990's, during President Bill Clinton's administration, as more of a speculative bubble than the payoff for prudent policies like balancing the budget.
It has already opened a rift between those Democrats, including Al Gore, who want to pursue a populist us-versus-them strategy for retaking the House and the White House, and pro-business centrists like Mr. Gore's running mate in 2000, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, who want to avoid a lurch leftward.
"There's no question that in a down or volatile economy, it's the party in power in the White House, whether it's fair or unfair, that takes the biggest hit," said Leon E. Panetta, who was chief of staff and budget director in the Clinton White House. "Having said that, the question then becomes how do Democrats deal with this issue, and I don't think they have quite figured out any kind of strategy other than to attack the other side."
It is not only elected officials who find themselves on the defensive. One of the biggest cheerleaders for the new economy during the 1990's was Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman. After initially expressing skepticism about stock prices -- he raised the prospect of "irrational exuberance" in late 1996 -- Mr. Greenspan went on to cite a resurgence in business productivity as reason to believe in a brighter economic future and, by implication, higher stock valuations.
But last week, with the market still skittish and the productivity miracle no longer looking quite so miraculous, Mr. Greenspan and his colleagues at the Fed downgraded their short-term outlook for the economy. Weeks after signaling that they expected to begin raising rates to avert the prospect of the economy overheating, they opened the door to further interest rate cuts, citing the fall in stock prices and the wave of corporate wrongdoing.
Wall Street was disappointed that Mr. Greenspan did not act more aggressively to prop up stocks. Indeed, said Paul McCulley, chief economist at Pimco, a bond trading firm, there was a growing perception that Mr. Greenspan was happy to urge investors on during the good times but did not care enough to help them in the bad.
"History is not going to be kind to Greenspan, because he was the cheerleader for the new-age economy," Mr. McCulley said. "As such he achieved cult-like status within the investor class. Now they feel like they've been betrayed. Whether they've actually been betrayed is another question, but that's how they feel."
Mr. Greenspan was appointed and reappointed by presidents of both parties, so his performance is unlikely to become a partisan issue. But with the national psyche tied up in the gyrations of the Dow and Nasdaq, politicians and their pollsters have been trying to divine the characteristics of the new investor class. Democrats and Republicans have found things that please and worry them. 
For the most part, pollsters say, being an investor is not by itself a predictor of political behavior. The spread of investing has not led, as some Republicans hoped, to a conservative drift in ideology. 
But the drop in stock prices has not so far dented Mr. Bush's popularity ratings much, either. And though polls show that voters see the president and his party as too close to big business, they have not shown any swing in the Democrats' favor when it comes to this fall's Congressional races.
Still, both sides say the effect of a declining market on an electorate whose financial fortunes in general and retirement savings in particular are riding on Wall Street could ultimately prove to be considerable. 
The lengths that Mr. Bush went to last week to project an image of being on top of the problem and armed with an agenda to deal with it -- even if it was essentially the same agenda he was selling when the economy was booming -- was evidence of how nervous Republicans in particular remained about how voters would respond to the first bear market of the 401(k) era. 
More evidence came from the decision by Congressional Republicans to distance themselves from Mr. Bush's plan for workers to invest some of their Social Security money in the stock market.
"There are relatively few people who see themselves primarily as investors," said Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster. "Having said that, people have invested tremendous hopes and dreams in their 401(k)'s, if not always tremendous amounts of money. Because those investments have been harmed, those people are worried -- and often the amount of money at stake and the degree of the worry are not correlated."
When asked whom they blame, Mr. Mellman said, voters point to corporate executives. But that, he said, does not get Mr. Bush and his party off the hook. "Voters see Republicans as aiding and abetting those corporate leaders and see Democrats as much more likely to be on the side of the ordinary working family," he said.
Republican strategists say the risks to their party are vastly overstated. In a memorandum he distributed in Washington last week, Matthew Dowd, the White House's pollster, noted that in January, at a time when the economy and the markets appeared to be recovering, voters who identified themselves as investors favored Republicans 40 percent to 32 percent. In the latest polls, he said, the Republican advantage among investors has expanded, to 45 to 32, despite the stock market's fall. 
Investors, Mr. Dowd said, tend to be optimists who take a long-term view and do not see government as the main solution to downturns in the markets -- all traits that should help tamp down their political response to dips in their wealth.
Like investors, politicians are learning that a sliding market forces tough choices between short-term responses to day-to-day gyrations and sticking to long-term plans despite the volatility. "To a certain extent," Mr. Panetta said, "both parties are caught up in the politics and the markets of the moment and are failing to develop or stay with long-term strategies."

Oedipus, Shmoedipus.
 Why cite a Greek hero when we can cite the president's favorite British hero? 
 In "Goldmember," Austin Powers has "Earn Daddy's Respect" on his To Do list. So the teary but still groovy spy confronts his prodigal father, played by Michael Caine.
"Got an issue?" Daddy breezily responds. "Here's a tissue." 
Tissue issues between the two Bush presidents spilled into public view on Thursday when that most faithful family retainer, Brent Scowcroft, wrote a jaw-dropping op-ed piece in The Wall Street Journal headlined "Don't Attack Saddam."
Mr. Scowcroft gave the back of his hand to conservatives' strenuous attempts to link Saddam to 9/11.
Bellicose Bushies have yet to offer a sustained and persuasive rationale for jumping Saddam, beyond yammering about how "evil" he is, as if he had a monopoly on that. 
In the Journal, Mr. Scowcroft, one of the team that drew that fateful line in the sand a decade ago, ticked off all the reasons why invading Iraq makes no sense: it would jeopardize, and maybe destroy, our global campaign against terrorism; it would unite the Arab world against us; it would require us to stay there forever; it would force Saddam to use the weapons against us or Israel.
"Scowcroft is now more critical of Bush's foreign policy than Sandy Berger, which is mind-boggling," says Bill Kristol, a Bush I veteran who edits The Weekly Standard.
No one who knows how close Mr. Scowcroft is to former President Bush -- they wrote a foreign policy memoir so symbiotic they alternated writing paragraphs -- believes he didn't check with Poppy first. Did 41 allow his old foreign policy valet to send a message to 43 that he could not bear to impart himself?
The father is hypersensitive about meddling and reluctant to give advice. He doesn't want his pride to get in the way of his son's making up his own mind on what's right.
"It's a very strange relationship," a former aide to the father says. "He's so careful about his son's prerogatives that I don't think he would tell him his own views."
But Bush the elder must be fed up with being his son's political punching bag. On everything from taxes to Iraq, the son has tried to use his father's failures in the eyes of conservatives as a reverse playbook. 
It must be galling for Bush pere to hear conservatives braying that the son has to finish the job in Iraq that the father wimped out on.
His proudest legacy, after all, was painstakingly stitching together a global coalition to stand up for the principle that one country cannot simply invade another without provocation. Now the son may blow off the coalition so he can invade a country without provocation.
Junior could also have made the case that Dad's tax increase, which got him into so much trouble, led to 10 years of prosperity. Instead he has philosophically joined the right-wingers who erroneously think that the tax increase caused a recession.
But W. has spent his life running from his father's long shadow, trying to usurp Dad's preppy moderate Republicanism with good ol' boy conservative Republicanism.
Poppy bequeathed his son, a foreign affairs neophyte, his own trusted Desert Storm team, with Dick Cheney as surrogate father.
But Mr. Cheney brought in Don Rumsfeld, an old rival of Poppy's, and he was joined at the Pentagon by Paul Wolfowitz and Richard Perle. This group is far more conservative, unilateral, ideological and belligerent than the worldly realists: 41, Scowcroft, Colin Powell and James Baker.
"The father and Scowcroft were about tying the coalition and the New World Order with a neat little bow," a Bush I official said. "Wolfowitz and Perle are: 'We're the new sheriff in town. We'll go it alone.' "
The Bush I moderates worry that the Bush II ideologues will use terrorism as an alibi for imperialism. Bush II thinks Bush I is trapped in self-justification.
Mr. Kristol writes in the upcoming Weekly Standard that Mr. Scowcroft and Mr. Powell are "appeasers" who "hate the idea of a morally grounded foreign policy that seeks aggressively and unapologetically to advance American principles around the world."
What does that make the old man? The Chamberlain of Kennebunkport?
Who needs a war plan? We need family therapy.

The entertainer and entrepreneur Sean Combs has earned a fortune from his Bad Boy Entertainment record label and Sean John clothing line. 
But the weak economy could threaten future sales.
 He knows this firsthand: his latest business venture, Blue Flame Marketing and Advertising, recently surveyed 659 people identified as "urban trendsetters" to see what they thought about the economy. Like many others, they, too, believe that it has lost its groove. 
 Forty-six percent felt that the country was in a full-blown recession and 66 percent said they expected the stock market "to get worse before it gets better."

HEADLINE: Fighting the Wrong Budget War 

 BODY:
Like some of America's biggest corporations, the United States government has been forced to revise its ledger recently. The results, which show that the 10-year $5.6 trillion surplus foreseen two years ago has mostly disappeared, has propelled President Bush into a budgetary conversion. He is suddenly a scourge of wasteful federal spending. Indeed, he refused last week to spend a minuscule $5 billion appropriated by Congress for a grab bag of "emergency" items, angering lawmakers from both parties. "If Congress will not show spending restraint, I will enforce spending restraint," he said yesterday. Mr. Bush is not wrong to be concerned about Congressional wastefulness or the long-term budgetary outlook. But he is wrong about priorities.
 Federal spending under Mr. Bush has risen at record rates because of pressing and legitimate military and domestic security needs, as well as other priorities like education and health. Along the way, Congress adopted the attitude that a billion here and there for other favorite items would never be noticed. Mr. Bush went along. He has not vetoed a single spending bill since becoming president. He also signed a ridiculously expensive farm bill; farmers are the swing vote in several close Senate races. Mr. Bush's new austerity is acknowledged by aides to be mostly symbolic. But their attitude seems to be that he has to draw the line somewhere. 
 The $5 billion package that Mr. Bush has killed, with what was effectively a pocket veto, is not, however, an opportune place to draw it. It contains money for home defenses, military spending, foreign aid, AIDS treatment and programs for victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. For the president, picking this fight on the current-year budget has become important because he and his budget director, Mitchell Daniels -- referred to by Mr. Bush as Blade -- are gearing up for yet another fight on next year's budget when Congress returns after Labor Day. The White House argues that the action this week will strengthen its hand for the next round.
These battles will be resolved in due course. The sums are not vast or consequential for the economy. The underlying strangeness of the fight is that Mr. Bush does not want to talk about the main reason for looming deficits: the tax cuts of last year. The administration's own budget numbers make clear that nearly 40 percent of the disappearing surplus is a result of the multiyear tax cut, with the remainder evaporating because of the economic downturn, increased spending and some accounting changes.
While campaigning in South Dakota last week, Mr. Bush attributed his economic problems to what he said was a recession inherited from President Bill Clinton and to the terrorist attacks and the corporate scandals of this year. Conveniently forgotten was Mr. Bush's confident prediction in 2001, when he first proposed his tax cut, that the country could "proceed with tax relief without fear of budget deficits, even if the economy softens." It is that statement that has turned out to be false prophecy.
Realistically speaking, there will not be a reconsideration of the tax cuts any time soon. The votes are not there to make the change. But history shows that Congresses and presidents are willing to raise taxes to close deficits in the face of war or as part of a grand bargain that involves austerity on the spending side. Both Bill Clinton and Mr. Bush's father embraced such deals.
Mr. Bush's decision to pick fights with Congress on the margins of federal spending is unlikely to have any impact on the budget or on the economy. Only when he wrestles with root causes will he begin to approach a solution.

HEADLINE: Armey May Be Leaving, But Isn't Going Quietly 

BYLINE:  By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 17 

 BODY:
Even though he decided not to run for the House of Representatives again, Dick Armey hardly has a retiring personality. So as he travels the country to help Republicans in his last political roundup, Mr. Armey has been making headlines that make him sound like the opposition to President Bush, even as he says, "I love him dearly."
 Before a West Coast swing scheduled for the next few days, he was in Texas this week concentrating more on bass fishing than on politics. But on Aug. 9 in Des Moines, he warned the president against attacking Iraq. Two days earlier, in Wichita, Kan., he had predicted the end of the trade embargo against Cuba. 
 That was only a few days after Mr. Armey, who is the majority leader, got the House to vote to ban the Justice Department's TIPS program, a proposed corps of truck drivers, meter readers and others reporting suspicious activities to the authorities. He considered it a threat to American freedom.
Is Mr. Armey feeling freer to sound off -- a freedom that, to be fair, he has never been loath to exercise, although not usually against a president of his own party -- now that his ninth and last term in the House is ending?
No, he insisted in an interview this week. "I think I probably just picked a couple of slow news days," he said.
Besides, Mr. Armey said, he was misunderstood.
In Des Moines he called Saddam Hussein a "blowhard." He said: "My own view would be to just let him bluster, let him rant and rave all he wants. As long as he behaves himself within his own borders, we should not be addressing any attack or resources against him." He also said, "We Americans don't make unprovoked attacks against other nations."
In the interview this week, Mr. Armey said: "I was talking about this nation and who we are. I have no love or affection for Saddam Hussein." He added that he was satisfied with President Bush's subsequent comments that he had made no decision about Iraq and that he would consult with Congress before acting.
Similarly, Mr. Armey complained that his prediction that Congress would soon stop voting for the embargo against Cuba had been misunderstood. The prediction "got translated into a statement of preference," he said.
So just what is his personal view of the embargo? "I have never made that public and I don't think I will now," he answered. Instead he will probably vote for it one last time this fall, out of friendship for two Cuban-American Republicans from Florida, Representatives Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Lincoln Diaz-Balart.
But the TIPS (Terrorism Information and Protection System) issue was different. No one misunderstood him, Mr. Armey said, and the president and Attorney General John Ashcroft were just wrong in supporting it. Though he said he was amused to find the American Civil Liberties Union praising him, he said he was also pleased that the tide seemed to be running his way with the Justice Department's announcement that meter readers and anyone who entered private homes would not be enlisted into the corps of watchers.
Still, he said the retreat was not enough and the plan should be abandoned. 
Mr. Armey, a native of Cando (pronounced can do), N.D., had never held public office before he won a tight race to upset a Democrat in 1984. He has never had a serious challenge since. In the House, he was known as a free-market conservative with little patience for politically attractive programs like farm subsidies. He not only opposed raising the federal minimum wage, he wanted to abolish it. In the mid-1980's he led a successful effort to create a base-closing commission that would list unneeded military installations and force Congress to accept or reject the entire list, thus preventing logrolling to keep pet bases open.
When the Republicans won the House in 1994, he moved up the leadership ladder behind Newt Gingrich, who advanced from minority whip to speaker. Mr. Armey, who had been chairman of the Republican Conference, became majority leader, and conservative Republicans relied on him to make sure that Mr. Gingrich's enthusiasms did not lead the speaker to hasty deal-making with President Bill Clinton.
Relations between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Armey were bitter. In 1993, Mr. Armey said that the ideas of Hillary Rodham Clinton, then the first lady, "sound a lot like Marx," and that "all her friends are Marxists." In 1995, he broke House protocol by telling Democrats there that Republicans did not consider "your president" important. After Mr. Armey joined for a time in an abortive coup against Mr. Gingrich in 1997, he was passed over when the speaker gave up the post after the 1998 elections, to be succeeded by J. Dennis Hastert.
Mr. Armey had difficulty winning re-election as leader in 1998, and since then has often seemed eclipsed by Representative Tom DeLay, another Texan who formally ranks below him as majority whip. 
A former economics professor and an advocate of lower taxes or a flat tax whose last major clash with a Republican president came over George H. W. Bush's acceptance of higher taxes in 1990, Mr. Armey has not said what he plans to do in retirement. "I am not counting the days until I retire," the 62-year-old Texan said. "It's still such an honor to serve the people in Congress."
But fishing is likely to play a big part. One of the things Mr. Armey says he likes best about Washington is bass fishing in the Potomac. 
The Bush White House does not appear seriously bothered by Mr. Armey's recent comments. After all, they hardly compare to what he said when the president's father decided to back tax increases in 1990: "I think the president's been victimized by bad advice from the people that work for him, and, frankly, I'm disappointed that he doesn't understand that the better alternative for the American people is to have fiscal responsibility and disciplined spending patterns in Washington."
They certainly do not compare to his answer when asked if he would have resigned if he had been caught in an affair with an intern, as Mr. Clinton was. He said resignation would not have come up because "my wife would have been standing over my dead body and she would have been saying, 'How do I reload this sucker?' "

HEADLINE: Virginia Blue Cross Plan Leads Shift to Lower-Cost Drugs 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: RICHMOND, Va. 

 BODY:
From April to June, people in Virginia's Blue Cross and Blue Shield plan filled 33,722 prescriptions for Celebrex and Vioxx, 27 percent fewer than in the same months last year.
 At the same time, the insurance company reported a sharp increase in the use of lower-cost generic drugs prescribed for the same purpose, treating arthritis and acute pain. 
 Insurers around the country are trying to duplicate that shift from brand-name to generic drugs as a way to slow the rapid growth in spending on prescription medicines. They have had some success. Almost every proposal in Congress to add drug benefits to Medicare would strongly encourage the use of generic medications. Otherwise, lawmakers say, Medicare could not afford the new benefit. 
The Virginia Blue Cross and Blue Shield plan, known as Trigon, has been a national leader in efforts to promote the use of generic drugs, by continually reminding doctors and patients of the savings that can be achieved.
Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans in Michigan and upstate New York are pushing similar initiatives. Their experiences offer important lessons for federal officials seeking ways to help the elderly with drug costs, even as the battle between generic and brand-name drug companies heats up in Congress and in courts around the country.
Ronald A. Lyon, vice president of Trigon for pharmacy services, said that at least 45 percent of members' prescriptions were now filled with generic drugs, up from 37 percent five years ago. Each increase of one percentage point saves $4 million to $5 million a year for employers and other Trigon clients and $2.5 million for individual consumers, Mr. Lyon said.
Copayments are lower for generic drugs. A Trigon patient typically pays $10 for a generic drug and $20 to $35 for a brand-name drug.
Not every drug has a generic alternative, because of a combination of patent laws and economic factors. But, Mr. Lyon said, Trigon patients receive generic medicines for 94 percent of the prescriptions when one is available.
A generic version of a brand-name drug has the same active ingredients, and the Food and Drug Administration says it is just as safe and effective. But the generic drug usually costs much less, in part because generic companies spend much less than brand-name drug companies on research and advertising.
Trigon says, for example, that Celebrex typically costs $732 a year, and Vioxx costs $604 for each patient. Those drugs are still under patent, so no exact generic equivalents are available.
But Trigon says most arthritis patients can be treated just as well, at much lower cost, with generic versions of older drugs. These include ibuprofen (a generic version of Motrin), which costs $32 a year; diclofenac (a generic version of Voltaren), for $140 a year; and naproxen (a generic version of Naprosyn), at $48 a year.
Trigon encourages doctors to consider treating high blood pressure, ulcers, depression and many other ailments with generic medications. But Celebrex and Vioxx, two of the 10 best-selling drugs worldwide last year, have become a particular focus of concern for Trigon. On the door of a pharmacist's office at Trigon headquarters here is a large model of a Celebrex capsule, with the message "A hard pill to swallow."
Doctors must get authorization from Trigon before the company will pay for a prescription of Celebrex or Vioxx. The form for prior authorization tells doctors that the "incidence of deaths and clinically significant side effects" for Celebrex and Vioxx is similar to that for older antiinflammatory drugs.
Vioxx, made by Merck, and Celebrex, marketed jointly by Pharmacia and Pfizer, had combined worldwide sales of $5.7 billion in 2001. They were the first in a new class of drugs known as Cox-2 inhibitors, and they have been heavily promoted for their ability to relieve pain without causing gastrointestinal problems. 
But Mr. Lyon said that many of the people using Celebrex and Vioxx did not need those specific drugs because they had no particular risk of gastrointestinal bleeding or other stomach problems -- a conclusion endorsed by an independent panel of doctors and pharmacists who advise Trigon.
The insurer uses a point system, based on age and medical history, to assess a patient's need for Celebrex and Vioxx, and it routinely denies coverage for patients who score below a certain level. "Instead," Mr. Lyon said, "we cover equally effective, safe, lower-cost drugs."
Trigon assigns "value ratings" to more than 2,000 drugs and prepares a report analyzing the prescriptions written by each doctor every three months. Drugs receive an "A" rating if they are deemed to provide a high level of safety and effectiveness "at an acceptable cost." Drugs receive a "D" rating if they are considered "too expensive," in view of the available alternatives.
Celebrex and Vioxx have "D" ratings, while Voltaren and naproxen have "A" ratings.
Jan D. Weiner, a spokeswoman for Merck, took issue with the rating for Vioxx. Merck, Ms. Weiner said, is telling doctors and managed care organizations that scientific studies show Vioxx is safer than some older drugs because it causes fewer gastrointestinal problems. 
Drug companies need approval from the F.D.A. to market generic products, but do not have to conduct extensive tests in animals or humans. Rather, they must show that a generic product delivers the same amount of active ingredients into a patient's bloodstream in the same amount of time.
Brand-name drug companies once argued that consumers could not be sure of the safety and effectiveness of generic drugs, but it has become more difficult to make that argument since the government now insists that the two types of drugs are equivalent. Still, the industry does express doubts.
"Generic drugs are not identical, nor are they required to be identical, to brand-name drugs," said Bruce Lott, a spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America. "So it may be unwise to substitute a generic for a brand-name drug that's working for a patient."
In theory, generic drugs have been an option for decades. But insurers have made greater efforts to encourage their use in recent years as drug costs have soared.
The potential savings are vividly illustrated by what happened when Eli Lilly lost patent protection for Prozac, its antidepressant.
Dr. Joel Owerbach, chief pharmacy officer at Excellus, which runs three Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans in upstate New York, said Excellus was originally paying $2.70 for a 20-milligram capsule of Prozac. It paid $2.25 for the first generic version, which became available last August, then was able to cut the payment to 40 cents a pill as more generic versions entered the market.
"If we could get doctors used to prescribing generic versions of Prozac, known as fluoxetine, it would be great," Dr. Owerbach said. "It's usually a good therapeutic alternative to antidepressants like Zoloft and Paxil, which cost more than $2 a dose."
Edward G. Sagebiel, a spokesman for Eli Lilly, said Prozac lost 80 percent of its market share within four months after its patent expired.

Will Japan Succumb to a Presidential Aura?

BYLINE:  By Leslie Wayne (COMPILED BY RICK GLADSTONE) 

 BODY:
 As President Bush worries about the economy here, his father, former President George Bush, is finding the Japanese economy rough going. An adviser to the Carlyle Group, an investment company based in Washington, the former president met this summer in Tokyo with more than 100 potential investors in the Carlyle Japan fund, which hopes to raise 50 billion yen, or about $413 million. 
 Carlyle says Mr. Bush does not do fund-raising for the firm -- he makes speeches to potential Carlyle investors while Carlyle executives make the actual pitch for cash. Still, even the aura of the presidency has not overcome a sluggish Japanese economy. Only half the money Carlyle sought has been raised. Nonetheless, Carlyle is doing better than some other American investment firms, which have closed up shop and left Japan. Leslie Wayne

To the Editor:
 Re "Colombia President Declares Limited State of Emergency" (news article, Aug. 13): 
 Creating a culture of peace and justice is one of the major challenges facing the new president, Alvaro Uribe Velez. 
His administration must resist the seductiveness of the power of the armed groups and the assumption that force is the only way to justice and democracy.
I went to Colombia a few weeks ago as part of a church delegation. The election of Mr. Uribe represents for some Colombians a fervent hope for peace and for others a prelude to full-scale war between his new government and the various armed groups of Colombia.
Foreign aid only helps create and sustain an industry of violence by flooding the country with more weapons. Aid needs to be directed more toward creating jobs and meeting basic human needs rather than building a military approach to peace.

HEADLINE: Validation of Rent Laws 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 The escalating homelessness problem in New York City (front page, Aug. 15) is an unequivocal validation of rent regulation. While politicians argue about the niceties of free-market economics, and real estate lobbyists cry poverty over rising construction costs, we now have proof of the true cost of deregulation: a vast increase in homelessness. 
 Homelessness in New York has increased in lockstep with rising rents and the gradual decontrol of affordable housing. If the current rent laws expire next year, the more than a million households now living in regulated apartments may face huge rent increases. How many thousands of new homeless families will be created as a result? Will the city be able to endure such a crisis? For New York City, strong rent laws are a matter of survival.

HEADLINE: Food Stamp Eligibility 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 While more than 800,000 lowincome New York City residents receive food stamps (letter, Aug. 14), it is a shame that at least that many eligible people do not. 
 The Urban Justice Center and other organizations participate in the Nutrition Outreach and Education Program, which is intended to increase awareness of and enrollment in federal nutrition-assistance programs. 
We prescreen potentially eligible clients and assist them in filing applications. 
Since food stamps are an entitlement, as many people as are eligible can receive assistance. And since the federal government pays for most of the program, it provides the post-9/11 economy much-needed revenue. By applying for food stamps, low-income people can help themselves and also help the city's economy.

HEADLINE: Democracy's Quiet Victory 

BYLINE:  By Joshua Muravchik; Joshua Muravchik, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, is the author of "Heaven on Earth: The Rise and Fall of Socialism."

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
A remarkable chain of events in recent months offers cause for cheer amid the bleak headlines of violence and economic distress. It suggests that democracy is completing its triumph as a global norm, endangering the remaining pockets of authoritarianism.
 A decade ago, Samuel Huntington coined the label "third wave" for the trend of democratization that had begun in Portugal in 1974. The first wave had lasted from the American revolution until the breakup of empires at the end of World War I; the second followed from decolonization after World War II. Each of these waves was followed by an ebb tide as fascism spread over Europe in the 20's and 30's and Communism and forms of autocratic socialism took hold in the third world in the 60's and 70's. 
 Mr. Huntington's metaphor invited expectations that the third wave, too, would recede. Something quite different has happened. Sure, many of the former Soviet republics are stuck in dictatorship. But more telling is the case of Argentina, where the politicians are dithering as the economy collapses, yet the generals have made no move to reclaim power -- or the situation in Eastern Europe, where former Communists fill the statehouses yet no one tries to undo democracy. Freedom House reports that the number of freely elected governments in the world has continued to climb, reaching 121 of the world's 192 independent countries this year.
Democracy has become an expectation, its claims hard to resist. Consider that in April a coup ousted President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, but the other Latin states combined to insist upon his return -- despite the apparent wishes of the Bush administration. Not that Mr. Chavez's neighbors liked him much more than we did; they simply insisted on defending the will of the voters.
In June, President Bush stunned the diplomatic establishment by insisting that realizing Palestinians' aspirations depends upon democratization. Arab rulers, none of them elected, had been lobbying for a different policy but hastened to endorse Mr. Bush's approach. "When the elections happen in the Palestinians' territories it is the Palestinians themselves who will choose their leader in a democratic fashion," declared Saudi Arabia's foreign minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal, whose main qualification is an accident of birth. "We wish that the Palestinians had held elections much earlier."
Days later, the first Arab Human Development Report was released by the United Nations Development Program and the Arab Fund for Social and Economic Development. With contributions from dozens of Arab scholars, it declared bluntly: "The wave of democracy that transformed governance in most of the world has barely reached the Arab states. The freedom deficit undermines human development and is one of the most painful manifestations of lagging political development."
Two weeks later, dozens of Iraqi military officers in exile convened to organize against Saddam Hussein. They endorsed a "federal democratic" Iraq and adopted a "code of honor" pledging to respect the "Iraqi people's choice of the regime they want." They said they would return to the barracks once "the building of civilian institutions starts."
Nearly simultaneously, in Durban, South Africa, African leaders created the African Union to replace the Organization of African Unity. The O.A.U.'s trademark had been that nothing a dictator does internally is anybody else's business. But the African Union declares that its objectives are to "promote democratic principles and institutions" and to "protect human and peoples' rights."
Last month the United Nations issued its Human Development Report. By tradition these reports give a wide berth to dictators. This year's, however, strikes an entirely different chord: "Advancing human development requires governance that is democratic in both form and substance." The report spells out what this means: representation, fair elections, checks and balances, and freedom of expression.
To be sure, the report is replete with warnings about regressive practices in some newborn democracies and the failures of others to deliver good governance or social progress. In this it echoes concerns voiced recently by scholars of democratization about states that have emerged from dictatorship but not effectively democratized.
These complaints reflect genuine disappointments, but they lack perspective. Let us not forget that it took our own democracy 86 years to abolish slavery, 144 years to enfranchise women and 189 to assure black people the vote. Critics of newer democracies claim they produce ineffectual policies -- but after a century and a half our own democracy produced the Great Depression. Democracy is not a rose garden. It is as fallible as human beings.
When the democracies born after the two world wars had hit hard times, they succumbed to messianic ideologies. Those seductive panaceas have been discredited. Today's new democracies encounter similar problems, but they muddle along.
The events mentioned above and the Freedom House statistics all suggest that democracy has established itself as a universal norm. Thus, an ebb from the third wave is less in prospect than the gathering of a fourth. It could reach China, where a younger, reformist generation is poised to inherit power. Or it could reach Iran, where citizens in all walks of life are increasingly bold in their opposition to theocratic rule. Change toward democratic regimes in Tehran and Baghdad would unleash a tsunami across the Islamic world, just as change in China will transform Asia.
The further spread of democracy will not end history. It promises only a friendlier, more humane and peaceful world, and that's enough.

Orbitz Can Now Book Tickets On American Airlines Directly

BYLINE:  By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
Following through on one of its most provocative business plans, Orbitz, the airline-owned online travel agent, has activated an electronic connection that allows it to book tickets directly in the reservation system of American Airlines. The setup allows Orbitz to bypass the central reservation systems that handle nearly all of the airline bookings by other travel agencies.
 Another eight airlines have agreed to create similar links with Orbitz, which now sells about 2 percent of the airline tickets in the country. 
 Orbitz had been using Worldspan, one of the three big reservations systems, to handle all its bookings, and will continue to use Worldspan for airlines that do not offer the direct connections. Orbitz says that the fee that it will charge airlines to make reservations directly will be about one-third what the airlines are paying to Worldspan. 
"Booking fees are something on which we spend hundreds of millions of dollars annually," said Craig Kreeger, vice president for passenger sales at American. "Orbitz Supplier Link offers a new, lower-cost model." American has created a direct connection to one corporate customer and hopes to establish similar links to other corporations and travel agencies.
The new system will not change the way travelers use Orbitz, though it may reduce errors in which flights were offered but were not actually available.
In their desperation to cut costs, the airlines have singled out the fees they pay to the reservation systems as a major source for potential savings. The three big reservation systems -- Sabre, Galileo and Worldspan -- each charge the airlines about $4 per flight segment on each ticket booked. The average ticket has about 2.5 segments, meaning the airlines pay $10 a ticket on average to the reservation systems. Orbitz estimates that airlines in the United States pay a total of $2.2 billion in booking fees.
Particularly galling to the airlines, the reservation systems rebate as much as half of the booking fees to travel agents, and offer their computer terminals to the agents free. Over the last few years, the airlines have been cutting the commissions they paid to travel agents, and most eliminated base commissions entirely last year, and they view the reservation-system rebates as a back channel for commissions.
The airlines created Orbitz, which opened to the public in June 2001, in large part to create a cheaper way for them to sell tickets. The airlines agreed to give Orbitz access to cheaper "Web fares" that previously were available only on their own individual Web sites. These low fares allowed Orbitz to quickly become one of the three biggest online travel agencies, along with Expedia and Travelocity. 
In return for those cheaper fares, Orbitz agreed to pass back to the airlines 60 percent of the rebate it receives from Worldspan. That deal meant the airlines' cost to book an average ticket on Orbitz was $8, compared with an overall average of $11.
With its new service, Orbitz is charging the airlines $4 a ticket, no matter how many flight segments are involved.
Competitors argue that Orbitz's deal to get exclusive low fares is unfair and an antitrust violation. Rivals have begun intensive lobbying in Washington to have the deal declared illegal. In the meantime, they dismiss the Orbitz direct-connection system as more promotion than substance.
"If you have a direct connection, you are just pushing costs from one place to another," said Sam Gilliland, the chief executive of Travelocity, the online travel agency owned by Sabre Holdings. "In the end, it will have very little economic benefit to the airlines."
Alex Zoghlin, the chief technology officer of Orbitz, said that the online service is performing every function for American that Worldspan had and that the costs to set up the link with American, a unit of the AMR Corporation, was minimal.
Sabre, meanwhile has its own proposal to reduce reservation fees, but for corporate travel, rather than for the individuals who mainly use Orbitz. Sabre has proposed cutting its fees to the airlines in half if travel agents agree to forgo fee rebates and to use Sabre's online corporate booking service, GetThere.com. Such an arrangement would involve agreements by airlines, travel agents and their corporate clients. So far it has no takers. 
Both Galileo, owned by the Cendant Corporation, and Worldspan, which is owned by three airlines, have said they are looking at ways to address the airlines' concerns and reduce their fees and the travel agent rebates. But none has made specific proposals.
Mr. Zoghlin says that Orbitz will be able to handle reservations far more cheaply than can the big reservations systems because it uses newer, less-expensive technology. The Orbitz reservations system that replaces Worldspan took only 14 computer programmers to create and runs on six $3,000 PC's.
But analysts questioned the significance of the Orbitz arrangement for the airlines unless other travel agencies copy the model.
"The airlines say this will save them money, but Orbitz is still a small percentage of tickets sold," said Lorraine Sileo, an analyst with PhoCusWright, an online travel consultant. "Until they can get 10, 20, 50 percent of tickets sold using direct connect, they are not going to get real savings."

Nanotechnology has arrived; a serious opposition is forming.

BYLINE:  By Barnaby J. Feder 

 BODY:
THE great Gray Goo debate is beginning to matter.
 The controversy involves the potential perils of making molecular-size objects and devices, a field known as nanotechnology. 
 From its earliest days, nanotechnology has had its fear-mongers, warning of novel and terrifying risks.
Who could be sure how products so small that they would be invisible to the human eye would behave, particularly when the nanoworld's basic design elements -- atoms and small molecules -- are governed by the surreal laws of quantum mechanics rather than the more familiar Newtonian physics of large objects? 
The ultimate nightmare was the so-called Gray Goo catastrophe, in which self-replicating microscopic robots the size of bacteria fill the world and wipe out humanity.
Until recently, though, the debate was restricted to the relatively small community of nanotechnology researchers and experts. The risks they discussed often seemed cartoony or vague compared with the dazzling breakthroughs they projected in fields like medicine, supercomputing, energy and environmental cleanup. 
Now, though, nanotechnology is toddling into commercialization, with nanoscale particles being embedded in consumer products like sunscreens, stain-resistant khakis and wound dressings.
A number of companies are racing to scale up production of carbon nanotubes -- molecule-size cylinders of carbon with unusual electrical, thermal and structural properties.
For the first time, nanotechnology is encountering the kind of real-world headwinds that have impeded biotechnology. 
Nanotechnology is becoming a new organizing focus for groups like the Science and Environmental Health Network, a World Wide Web-centered research center for environmental and public health groups. The network is a leading proponent of the go-slower approach to new technology, sometimes known as the precautionary principle.
The principle has become a potent force in European regulation in recent years and is frequently discussed, if less adhered to, among regulators in the United States.
The most conservative backers of the principle tend to look for proof beyond a reasonable doubt that potential risks have been examined, as well as evidence that less risky ways of reaching the same or similar goals have been weighed. And such critics do not necessarily accept industry's definitions of accepted science. For instance, the Science and Environmental Health Network gives much more weight than do most industry scientists and government regulators to theories that chemicals in the environment are disrupting the human endocrine system and contributing to a wide range of ailments.
One notable addition to the go-slow bandwagon is the ETC Group (so named for Eco-Equity Erosion, Technology Transformation and Corporate Control), based in Winnipeg, Manitoba. In the 1990's, under its previous name -- the Rural Advancement Foundation International -- the group became a well-known opponent of agricultural biotechnology, pasting the science-fiction label "Terminator Technology" on research supported by Monsanto, the Agriculture Department and several other companies interested in genetically engineering plants that would be incapable of producing fertile seeds.
The inventors of the technology saw numerous potential benefits from such sterility, including a reduced risk that other genetically engineered characteristics in plants -- like resistance to herbicides -- could escape into weeds. But the Rural Advancement Foundation and others saw the effort as an attempt by big business to make it impossible for small farmers to plant crops from seed they saved the previous year.
Whatever the merits on either side, Monsanto and others interested in the technology were pummeled by the foundation's advocacy skills and forced to retreat from the seed research. Now, reborn as the ETC Group, the organization has broadened its concerns to include nanotechnology.
"We've had a file on it since 1988," said Pat Mooney, executive director of ETC, "but it was on the back burner until we did a patent search two years ago. We were shocked at the number of patents, how fast it was accelerating and the range of big companies involved."
Nanotechnology's skeptics, like Mr. Mooney, and the field's advocates can sound indistinguishable on some points. Both want a sharp increase in financing for research to determine the relevant questions and begin rigorous assessments of nanotechnology's risks. And both say there is enough time to create a dialogue and consensus that could prevent the kind of confrontations that have plagued biotechnology. "We recognize that nanotechnology's potential for being useful is phenomenal," Mr. Mooney said.
But the addition of groups like ETC to the nanotechnology debate brings in experienced skeptics of industry's motives and strong backers of increased government regulation. The questions about risk management are becoming much more specific and, as the science-fiction aspect of the debate recedes, pressure is mounting for regulators to step in.
Mr. Mooney's group recently began homing in on the dearth of published research about how nanoparticles interact with living cells. That issue is already on the radar of scientists at the Environmental Protection Agency, which in March invited experts at Rice University's Center for Biological and Environmental Technology to brief them on such issues. 
Seizing on a report about the meeting in Small Times, a nanotechnology trade publication, ETC began telling its network of advocacy groups that reputable researchers had deep concerns about the environmental risks.
ETC asserts that research suggests that the characteristics that make carbon nanotubes and similar nanoscale particles attractive candidates for carrying drugs into the brain could also allow such particles to transport toxins. It quotes Dr. Mark Weisner, a Rice professor, as warning that nanotubes, because of their needle-like shape, could become "the next asbestos." ETC also worries about a lack of research into how nanoparticles absorbed by bacteria might enter the food chain.
ETC's critics say the group has taken the concerns of Dr. Weisner and others out of context.
Undaunted, Mr. Mooney is urging allies to join ETC's campaign to persuade heads of state who attend the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg next week to declare a moratorium on commercial production of nanomaterials. He wants them to set up "a transparent global process" for evaluating the social, health and environmental risks of nanotechnology.
But some nanotechnology experts consider that plea naive and self-defeating. Because nanotechnology is gaining momentum from the convergence of advances in genetics, robotics and artificial intelligence, it has become an unstoppable force, said Douglas Mulhall, author of the recently published "Our Molecular Future" (Prometheus Books). "A moratorium isn't going to happen," Mr. Mulhall said, "so it's the wrong thing for environmentalists to focus on."
It would be better, he said, for them to join in the push for far more research on potential benefits and risks.
Whatever happens, it is clear that the crosscurrents of opinion that will shape nanotechnology's commercialization are bound to become stronger -- and more unpredictable -- as a broader range of participants join the Gray Goo debate.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Some Magazines Are Publishing Biggest September Issues Ever

BYLINE:  By DAVID CARR and ALLISON FASS 

 BODY:
The media recession seems unwilling to relinquish its stubborn grip on the magazine industry. Unless the magazine is Men's Health. Or GQ. Or Midwest Living. Or another one of a fortunate group that is bucking the trend by publishing remarkably fat September issues.
 Even as the television and radio industries bounce back smartly from a terrible 2001, most magazines are still showing nearly double-digit percentage declines in advertising pages so far this year. And the early returns on how most magazines fared with their September issues, a major month for publishers' bottom lines and a harbinger of whether the fourth quarter can salvage what has come before, are not very encouraging. 
 That is why the September results of some magazines -- which also include Maxim, Fitness and Child -- are so noteworthy. These magazines, all of which are five years old or more, are publishing the biggest September issues in their histories. And at least three magazines, Details, YM and Health, are having their best-ever months, ad pages-wise. 
So how is it that a magazine rack full of technology magazines that look like brochures and travel magazines that are going nowhere can carry other titles bursting with more ad pages than they had during even the glory years of the late 1990's?
Advertisers and magazine executives attribute the patchy rebound to the return of spending in some ad categories like fashion and the continued strength in home furnishings. But even in those areas, advertisers are being increasingly selective where they place their dollars, often favoring the market leaders at the expense of smaller, less successful magazines.
"I think there is a back-to-school mentality going on," Eric Thorkilsen, president of This Old House Ventures, said referring to advertisers' actions. "There is pent-up demand. They may have been throttling back their spending earlier in the year, but now they are trying to make their own numbers and hoping the spending helps them climb the mountain." Mr. Thorkilsen's magazine, This Old House, has benefited from the booming housing market, and although the September issue is not its biggest ever in ad pages, it has brought in the most advertising revenue. (The hip-hop magazine The Source also has its biggest revenue generator with this September's issue.)
Stacey Lippman, managing director of the New York office of Carat USA, part of the Carat North America unit of the Aegis Group, whose media-buying clients include Adidas and Hyundai Motor America, said he thinks many advertisers are trying to fill a hole -- both economic and psychic -- created by the terrible events of last fall. "Think back to this time last year," he said. "All of the fashion and retail did all their buys for the fall season and then what? Everything was obliterated. They never even had a season because people had more important things to do. This country went to war."
And the sluice of advertising money that poured into the recent marketplace for buying commercial time in advance of television networks' fall prime-time seasons may also be priming the pump. After suffering painful upfronts, as the marketplace is called, last year, the broadcast television networks received commitments for more than $8 billion in advertising, up from $7 billion the year before. The robust spending from marketers like movie studios and carmakers also rained down on the cable networks, which received about $4.8 billion in commitments, compared to $4 billion last year. 
"There definitely were clients on the sidelines but the strong broadcast and cable market is making more of a seller's market," said Eric Blankfein, vice president and director of media planning at Horizon Media, whose clients include Ace Hardware. "It's turned around and I think people are realizing that if they don't come in off the sidelines they're going to be paying much higher increases than they have in the recent past." 
But the magazine industry's recovery is a sputtering one, particularly in comparison with the TV industry's. Media Industry Newsletter's round-up of how monthly magazines fared in September -- the ads for which were bought around the same time of the television upfronts -- shows that ad pages are effectively flat, down 0.2 percent. And the advertising dollars that are being spent are not spread around as widely as they were just a few years ago during the boom times. 
Marketers that used to place ads in three or four similar magazines have now scaled back their largess, meaning a rising tide does not lift all boats. That may help explain why GQ, which is celebrating its 45th anniversary in September, is up 30.7 percent in ad pages for that issue, while Esquire is down 8.4 percent, according to Media Industry Newsletter. 
Vogue, meanwhile, is experiencing its best September since 1989, while Elle's ad pages have slipped 11.5 percent from its September 2001 issue.
"The marketplace has become very competitive due to the economy and consumer brands being more efficient and more conservative, in that situation, the strongest magazine brands and the strongest publishing teams have a huge advantage," said Kim Vernon, senior vice president for global advertising and communications for Calvin Klein in New York. "Quite possibly some of the books that are having their best years ever, quite possibly have some of the strongest teams. And they have the leverage to take pages away from other brands."
Ron Galotti, vice president and publisher of GQ, not surprisingly seconds that opinion. "I think that people do really gravitate toward the stronger brand," he said. "When things are cooking and everybody has big budgets, people are a bit more cavalier in their spending. When times are tight, they go with what they know is going to work."
That may be so, although Esquire's vice president and publisher, Valerie Salembier, points out that Esquire's pages would also have been up if a 16-page insert from Saks Fifth Avenue slated for the October issue had run in September as it did last year. And, she added, GQ and its sister publications at its owner, Conde Nast Publications, use advertorials -- ad sections that mimic editorial -- to bulk up without adding much in the way of revenue. 
"Hearst simply doesn't do advertorials, very, very rarely," she said, referring to the owner of Esquire. "It's just not profitable."
Mr. Galotti denied Ms. Salembier's claim, saying that the sections do make a money for the magazine. And demonstrating just how nasty competition can get in these tightwad times, he relayed the following statement through a spokeswoman: "Have you taken a look at Esquire lately? If I was the publisher of Esquire, I'd say anything I could to compete with GQ." 
Sniping aside, there may be another explanation why pages are up in certain cases -- the strength of a brand called September. The month is one of the more financially successful for magazine publishers, as advertisers, particularly fashion companies, introduce their products for the fall. (That is why Vogue weighs in at four pounds and 750 pages this year.) The magazines tailor their content accordingly, and readers buy more copies, which makes the advertisers happy. 
But there may be a downside to this virtuous publishing circle. Advertisers might not be bolstering their overall ad budgets this year, just transferring dollars they would have spent in other issues. Whether this theory proves correct will become clear later this fall.
"There is a tremendous amount of activity around the planning cycle right now," said Stephen M. Lacy, president of the publishing group at the Meredith Corporation, whose Country Home had its best September ever this year (although it has had a September issue only since 1999). "People who didn't want to hear about those things last year are now showing interest this year. Now, whether they will pull the trigger on those programs is hard to judge." 
Advertisers are not much better at divining the future. "Our clients are not cutting their budgets, but they are not opening the floodgates either," said Mr. Lippman, of the media-buying firm Carat USA. "We all need to mind our knitting right now, but I think that there is the possibility that things are picking up."

HEADLINE: BOOKS OF THE TIMES; 
How a Few Sparkling Yellow Flakes Altered History

BYLINE:  By JANET MASLIN 

 BODY:
THE AGE OF GOLD
The California Gold Rush and the New American Dream
By H. W. Brands
Illustrated. 547 pages. Doubleday. $29.95.
 "The Age of Gold" begins in 1848 in Coloma, Calif., with a carpenter named James Marshall, who noticed glittering yellow flakes in a riverbed while working to improve a lumber mill. A century and a half later it concludes in the same place, where a statue of Marshall now surveys the same landscape. In the intervening time, as the historian H. W. Brands explains in an engrossing, multifaceted history of the gold rush, Marshall's discovery profoundly changed the world. 
 Mr. Brands presents the gold rush as "a seminal event in history, one of those rare moments that divide human existence into before and after." And he patiently sets forth evidence for that claim. In a book that explores history, politics, geology, adventure and industry with omnibus enthusiasm, he contends that California's mother lode of gold had a transforming effect on American character. In his view of 19th-century American upheaval, 1848 is a more significant turning point than the end of the Civil War.
"The old American dream," he writes, "the dream inherited from 10 generations of ancestors, was the dream of the Puritans, of Benjamin Franklin's Poor Richard, of Thomas Jefferson's yeoman farmers: of men and women content to accumulate their modest fortunes a little at a time, year by year by year. The new dream was the dream of instant wealth, won in a twinkling by audacity and good luck." And for better or worse its meaning was "that El Dorado, not some Puritan city on a hill, was the proper abode of the American people."
"The Age of Gold," by a biographer of Benjamin Franklin ("The First American") and Theodore Roosevelt ("T. R."), finds many angles from which this change can be observed. Mr. Brand draws heavily upon firsthand accounts -- letters, memoirs, newspaper articles, unpublished manuscripts -- to provide immediacy. Some of the passages invoked are livelier than others, and his book unfolds in an evenhanded, instructive tone, without excess animation. But this is a serious, comprehensive study, filled with memorable visions and interesting observations. Its author, like the miners of the gold rush themselves, leaves no stone unturned.
He begins with the first misconception of gold rush lore: that anyone heading for California was actually able to hurry. "The Age of Gold" explores the arduous, life-altering aspects of setting out on such a journey and offers the voices of many such travelers. If they came by sea from the East Coast of the United States, the voyage could take six months and require great stamina. More affluent travelers could trek across Panama and make better time, but that, too, entailed hardship. One account here describes a Panamanian meal of baked monkey, with iguana as an alternate choice.
Another voyager describes a custom among Panamanian women: "They have a fashion of making their hair useful as well as ornamental, and it is not unusual to see the ends of three or four half-smoked cigars sticking out from the folds of their hair at the back of the head." For many of the travelers quoted here, the exotica encountered en route only heightened the sense of adventure.
But "The Age of Gold" also describes the brutal hardships of overland travel, with firsthand accounts from the place that would later be named Death Valley. It captures the challenge of crossing uncharted mountain ranges, not having any idea of how many of them lie ahead; of travelers thirsty enough to chew pebbles to induce saliva; of a place where "the water came out of the ground boiling hot and laced with minerals," but it was the only water to be had. In this context, simply reaching San Francisco -- which until lately had been a small place called Yerba Buena -- was half the battle.
"The Age of Gold" goes on to describe the changes wrought by the boom economy upon California life. "They had to build a society, to fashion the civil and political institutions that would allow this heterogeneous horde to live cheek by jowl, hip to knee, without murdering one another more often than necessary," Mr. Brands explains. Newly annexed from Mexico, California had to develop its own political life and to confront the essential question of slavery. The book carries the uproar over where California would be aligned in the slavery question to Congress, where Daniel Webster, John Calhoun and Henry Clay were parties to heated debate.
John Charles Fremont, the explorer, celebrity, gold magnate and presidential candidate known as Pathfinder to the West, plays a major role in "The Age of Gold," as does his wife, Jessie. (A full-length Fremont biography is due this fall.) And this book is present at the creation of other California success stories, like those of Leland Stanford and George Hearst. One of the incidental details here is that an enterprising teenager from Nantucket, James Folger, found a way to use the sails of abandoned whale ship for coffee grinding. Another is that ships had a way of being abandoned as soon as their crews anchored anywhere near gold mines.
Xenophobia and racial tensions are also part of this story. Mr. Brands describes the destruction of California's Indian population, the bigotry against Chinese and other immigrants and the demotion of indigenous Mexicans (born when California was still part of Mexico) to second-class citizens. He also presents the colorful exploits of Australian visitors, who fit into the boomtown atmosphere and would later have their own gold fever back home. 
"This is a memorable day in the history of New South Wales," a California-seasoned Australian named Edward Hargraves would announce to his guide after discovering his first flash in the pan outside Sydney. "I shall be a baronet, you will be knighted, and my old horse will be stuffed, put into a glass case and sent to the British Museum!"
The best display of mining fever to be found here comes from Samuel Clemens, who believed that he had profited mightily from an investment in the Comstock Lode. "I enjoyed what to me was an entirely new phase of existence -- a butterfly idleness; nothing to do, nobody to be responsible to, and untroubled with financial uneasiness," he wrote of his flush times in San Francisco. "I lived at the best hotel, exhibited my clothes in the most conspicuous places, infested the opera, and learned to seem enraptured with music which oftener afflicted my ignorant ear than enchanted it." 
He continued: "I attended private parties in sumptuous evening dress, simpered and aired my graces like a born beau, and polked and schottisched with a step peculiar to myself -- and the kangaroo."
Then his stocks collapsed, forcing the man who would be best known as Mark Twain to resume his writing career. His change of fortune appears not to have had deleterious effects. But on the whole, according to the evidence presented here, "one might easily conclude that, whatever its actual chemical properties, the gold of California was corrosive of personal happiness," Mr. Brands writes, "and that its coefficient of friction was such that it invariably slipped through the hands of those who acquired it."

HEADLINE: Nothing to Prove, George Wolfe Is Liberated 

BYLINE:  By ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
Maybe it was because the last year was tough for the arts generally after Sept. 11, and George C. Wolfe, producer of the Public Theater, found solace in the work. Maybe it was because the last year was rough for the business side of the Public in particular, and Mr. Wolfe sought refuge in the work. Or maybe it was because in the last year Mr. Wolfe created his 10th Broadway show in 10 years, and he simply felt he had nothing left to prove. 
 Whatever the reason, the year has proved to be one of the strongest artistic seasons of Mr. Wolfe's career. 
 The play "Topdog/Underdog," which was directed by Mr. Wolfe at the Public and written by Suzan-Lori Parks, whom he discovered and nurtured, won the Pulitzer Prize and moved to Broadway. The revue "Elaine Stritch at Liberty," which Mr. Wolfe directed at the Public, moved to Broadway and won a Tony Award for best special theatrical event. And the musical revue "Harlem Song," which Mr. Wolfe directed and wrote as a tourist attraction for the Apollo Theater, recently opened to enthusiastic reviews. 
In an interview in his office at the Public on Lafayette Street, wearing khakis and a white T-shirt and talking in his usual animated, analytical style, Mr. Wolfe suggested that what his most recent projects had in common was a certain degree of selflessness. "I didn't do these three shows for me at all," he said. "And I feel really liberated by that in some incredible way."
His 1992 show, "Jelly's Last Jam," Mr. Wolfe said, was about Jelly Roll Morton and the birth of jazz, but it was also about being his First Broadway Show. Similarly, the two-part "Angels in America" by Tony Kushner was a groundbreaking play as an epic exploration of AIDS in 1993, but it also carried with it the burden of being Mr. Wolfe's first Broadway dramatic play and, in two parts, something of a marathon.
"I was proving things to myself and maybe things to the theater community," Mr. Wolfe said. 
With all three of his most recent productions, however, Mr. Wolfe said, he was less concerned with what the projects would say about him and more with wanting to get the word out: about Ms. Parks's writing, about Ms. Stritch's reservoir of talent, about Harlem's tenacity.
"These weren't vanity shows in any way, shape or form," Mr. Wolfe said. "I was in service to the stories."
"Harlem Song" recounts the history of Harlem in song, dance, old photographs and filmed testimonials from residents; it bills itself as the first extended musical engagement in the Apollo's 88-year history. At stake was not only whether Mr. Wolfe could jam Harlem's heritage into 90 cohesive and compelling theatrical minutes, but also whether the production could usher in a new chapter for the financially troubled Apollo and help contribute toward Harlem's recovery. 
This additional agenda, Mr. Wolfe said, created a whole new level of pressure. "Will this piece bring about economic rejuvenation?" he said. "I knew it was going to be scrutinized." 
Despite a potentially overwhelming amount of source material, Mr. Wolfe managed to cram a lot into the show, from the joyous Joe Louis fight to the unforgiving hunger of the Depression. "History directed me," he said. "There's no place more theatrical than history. And if you really burrow underneath, things announce themselves."
The challenge, Mr. Wolfe said, was not to make the show feel like a history lesson, although school groups are expected to attend. "How layered can you make it and can it still float?" Mr. Wolfe asked.
"The only rule of a musical," he added, "is that it must maintain its buoyancy."
The story Ms. Parks tells in "Topdog," which recently closed on Broadway, is about two brothers struggling to get by, torn between protecting and rejecting each other. The brothers were played at the Public by Jeffrey Wright and Don Cheadle and on Broadway by Mr. Wright and Mos Def. 
"I wanted to say, 'World, you should know this playwright,' " Mr. Wolfe said. "This playwright is saying amazing things about the human condition. This playwright is saying amazing things about America."
In her one-woman show (which closed on Broadway in May, starts a London run in October and may have a national tour) Ms. Stritch recalls the heady highs and liquor-soaked lows of her career in an evening that includes many of her show-stopping songs. Ms. Stritch is widely known in the theater world for being difficult to work with. But Mr. Wolfe said he and she got along very well, in part because they share the same wicked sense of humor, in part because of mutual respect.
"A lot of directors tend to manipulate actors' vulnerability to get what they want and that can work," Mr. Wolfe said. "But I think I spoke to who she is, which is a very smart, very dedicated, very obsessive artist. I respond to that because I think I have all of those things inside of me."
"I think she felt safe with me," Mr. Wolfe continued. "That's one of the things that I do. You've got to make the rehearsal room very safe. You can't bully people, because if you bully people, they're going to freeze and lock up."
Although he takes it all very seriously, Mr. Wolfe said he wanted the people he worked with to feel free. "I think the thing that makes me a good artist is I have this incredible sense of play," he said. "As a child I lived in my imagination. At the same time I have this incredible warrior energy which also gets me in trouble."
It is that warrior energy that appears to have exacerbated Mr. Wolfe's difficulties with Fran Reiter, who lasted less than a year as executive director at the Public (and according to several people at the theater, had a warrior energy of her own). Mara Manus, formerly of the Ford Foundation, starts this month as Ms. Reiter's successor.
The warrior in Mr. Wolfe was also apparently triggered during "The Wild Party," the musical he wrote with Michael John LaChiusa and directed. The show closed after a brief run on Broadway in 2000 and was complicated by Mr. Wolfe's clashes with the commercial producer Scott Rudin and the volatile behavior of the actor Mandy Patinkin. Nevertheless Mr. Wolfe said he stood by the project as worthwhile and hoped to revisit the show someday. 
"It is one of the most astonishing scores that's been written in the past 20 years," he said. 
"You go through an intense experience like 'The Wild Party,' where you really believe in the material, and you use everything you have in your body -- your intelligence, your heart, your guts -- and all kinds of things happen as a result," he continued. "And you wake up and you go: 'O.K., I'm hurt, I'm wounded, I'm damaged. I would do it again, I would do it again differently. I survived.' "
He added: "It's a wonderful thing not to be imprisoned by the need for success. And you've shed something, something really important. And you go back to work."
It was the need for success that Mr. Wolfe said doomed his money-losing production of "On the Town." "I wanted to create a commercial hit for the Public," he said. 
Looking back at the last decade -- which includes Anna Deavere Smith's "Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992" in 1994, "Bring In da Noise, Bring In da Funk" in 1995 and "On the Town" in 1997 -- Mr. Wolfe said he had no regrets. 
"They all were incredibly intense journeys," he said. "They were all -- except for 'On the Town' -- shows I felt were challenging and engaged the audience to think about theater in visceral and conceptual ways."
Mr. Wolfe said he was excited about the projects he has coming up this year, including "Radiant Baby," a musical based on the life of the pop artist Keith Haring with a book by Stuart Ross, music by Debra Barsha and lyrics by Ira Gasman with Ms. Barsha and Mr. Ross; and "Caroline, or Change," a musical about blacks and Jews set in Louisiana with book and lyrics by Mr. Kushner and music by Jeanine Tesori.
Ultimately, what fuels most everything he does may be a motivation that sounds deceptively basic, Mr. Wolfe said: "Wanting people to love something that you love."

HEADLINE: Senecas Sign Pact for Casinos In Niagara Falls and Buffalo 

BYLINE:  By SARAH KERSHAW 

 BODY:
After months of negotiation, the Seneca Nation of Indians and New York State yesterday signed an agreement to open casinos on Indian land in Buffalo and Niagara Falls.
 The plan must still overcome legal challenges and be approved by the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs. 
 But with the signing yesterday of a 14-year compact that is estimated to bring several billion dollars in revenue to the Seneca Nation and hundreds of millions of dollars to the state over the life of the agreement, the two casinos came one step closer to reality. 
In an effort to offset the economic losses the state has suffered since Sept. 11, legislators who had been reluctant to pursue gambling as a source of revenue moved ahead last fall, paving the way for Gov. George E. Pataki to negotiate compacts for six Indian-owned casinos, three in western New York and three in the Catskills. 
"The sun is shining on Niagara Falls and western New York today," Mr. Pataki said yesterday at a news conference in Niagara Falls. "We will have casinos, economic opportunities, development and jobs, jobs, jobs."
The Seneca Nation, which has three reservations in western New York and 6,700 members, voted in favor of the casinos in May. But a sticking point over a labor contract that would cover casino construction workers and employees had held up the agreement.
"It took a long time working this out," said Cyrus M. Schindler, the nation's president, who joined Mr. Pataki at the news conference. "We both had a job to do. It's not something that you just run in and sign, like buying a car."
The state stands to realize $300 million to $400 million a year from the two Seneca casinos and the four others that are planned, officials said. If the Seneca plan is approved by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the first casino will open in Niagara Falls, officials said, in late 2002 or early 2003, followed by the Buffalo casino.
New York State law bars the operation of slot machines or other casino games on non-Indian land except for special charity events like Las Vegas nights.

HEADLINE: Israel Will Start Pullout in Gaza And Bethlehem 

BYLINE:  By SERGE SCHMEMANN 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Aug. 18 

 BODY:
Israeli and Palestinian officials agreed late today that Israeli troops would start a trial withdrawal from reoccupied territory in the Gaza Strip and Bethlehem, in the West Bank, on the condition that the Palestinians take responsibility for reducing tensions in those places.
 Though details were not immediately known, the Israeli Defense Ministry said the withdrawal would begin on Monday. 
 The agreement, reached at a four-hour meeting in Tel Aviv between the Israeli defense minister, Benjamin Ben-Eliezer, and the Palestinian Authority interior minister, Abdel Razak Yehiyeh, was the first effort at a cease-fire in the current conflict that was negotiated directly between Israel and the Palestinians. Since the outbreak of the Palestinian uprising 22 months ago, more than 2,000 people have died, and several earlier attempts by the United States to mediate a cease-fire have failed. 
The agreement was in effect a pilot plan for further moves toward a full cease-fire. "The steps are essential as a starting point for the future political and security process," Mr. Ben-Eliezer said in a statement. He told Israeli Army radio, "The talks are aimed at getting a cease-fire and reducing tension."
On Aug. 5, Mr. Ben-Eliezer had first proposed a withdrawal only from Gaza, but the initial talks faltered. Among other things, the Palestinians insisted that there also be a withdrawal in the West Bank. Contacts resumed last week, with Bethlehem also under discussion.
The proposal came to be known as Gaza First. Israeli forces in Gaza have remained largely on the fringes of populated areas, in contrast to the West Bank, where Israel has reoccupied seven of the eight major towns since June. The Israelis contended that because the Palestinian security apparatus remained relatively intact in Gaza, it was a better testing ground for security cooperation.
For the first time in several months, news photographers were allowed to photograph the negotiators before the meeting, indicating that both sides wanted to publicize the fact that they were working together again. The chief of the Shin Bet intelligence service, the Israeli military chief of planning and policy, and the increasingly visible security adviser to Yasir Arafat, Muhammad Dahlan, were also present.
A statement issued by the Defense Ministry said, "Both sides agree to start implementing the initiative tomorrow in Gaza and Bethlehem." It added that the withdrawal was contingent on the Palestinians taking "responsibility to calm the security situation and reduce violence."
"The Defense Ministry agreed that Israel, for its part, would do everything in order to ease conditions on the Palestinian population, especially for civilians, and in the humanitarian area at this time," the statement said.
There was no immediate comment from the Palestinians.
Despite the agreement, the Israeli hunt for Palestinian militants continued unabated. A military spokesman said the army detained 16 suspects in operations in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank cities of Ramallah and Qalqilya.
Earlier in the day, Mr. Ben-Eliezer said at a cabinet meeting that the number of Palestinian attacks had abated over the last week. But he attributed the drop to Israeli operations rather than any lessening of Palestinian efforts to attack Israelis.
At that meeting, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said that an agreement with Palestine was in Israel's interest, but that "activity against terrorist leaders" would continue.
The major test of the security arrangement was likely to be whether the Palestinian Authority was prepared to crack down on Hamas, the militant Islamic movement. For more than a week now, the authority has been holding talks with major Palestinian factions, including Hamas, on a common platform, including a ban on attacks inside Israel.
So far, Hamas and Islamic Jihad, another militant group, have refused to forswear attacks on Israelis, or to abandon their fundamental opposition to the existence of Israel.
For the Israeli government, there was an extra satisfaction in announcing the pilot withdrawal during a visit by a special United Nations envoy, Catherine Bertini, who was sent to assess the needs of Palestinian civilians during the occupation. Meeting with Ms. Bertini earlier in the day, Mr. Ben-Eliezer said, "I can assure you of one thing -- that we will do everything possible in order to ease the life of the Palestinians."
The uprising and the Israeli reoccupation of Palestinian cities have devastated the Palestinian economy. According to the World Bank, half the Palestinians now live in poverty, on no more than $2 a day, and malnutrition is on the rise.
In another development, the Israeli High Court today granted a coalition of human rights groups a one-week restraining order against the army's use of what has come to be known as the "neighbor practice" of sending a Palestinian bystander to go into a suspect's house to seek his surrender.
The practice came to light on Aug. 14, when a 19-year-old Palestinian was shot dead after soldiers ordered him to knock on the door of a Hamas suspect. After the shooting, Israelis demolished the house, burying the suspect, Nasser Jarar.
In May, the army agreed to stop using Palestinians as "human shields" in its searches of Palestinian towns and cities. But the army contended that sending civilians as messengers did not make them into human shields.
The human rights organizations argued that the death of the 19-year-old neighbor proved that the effect was the same, and a violation of the Geneva Convention.
Spokesmen for the human rights groups said the High Court granted a temporary injunction while the state responded to the challenge.

HEADLINE: Jabs Are 'Nothing Personal,' A Challenger to Pataki Says 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
It was a 30-minute ride from a heliport to a campaign stop in Manhattan, but during that time, Tom Golisano, the billionaire third-party candidate for governor, lost no time unleashing sharp, and relentless, criticisms of the man he hopes to unseat.
 Yet, amid the charges and strident election positioning, even as his campaign has unleashed yet another television advertising barrage against Gov. George E. Pataki, Mr. Golisano contends that his jabs at the Republican incumbent represent nothing personal. 
 "There is nothing personal to it at all," Mr. Golisano said, sitting in a van as part of a campaign trip through the state.
But then, Mr. Golisano stopped to reflect. "Well, now that I think about it, I take my tax bill very personally," he said. "And it's probably a lot higher than average. But beyond that, there's nothing personal."
Despite his protests to the contrary, many politicians contend that they have perceived a personal tone to Mr. Golisano's campaign against Mr. Pataki, not only from the candidate but from many of his surrogates. Indeed, some of his aides, in conversations about the campaign, have become high-pitched, even using an occasional expletive when discussing the governor.
Mr. Golisano is running in two smaller-party primaries for governor, against Mr. Pataki in both cases. He is running in the primary for the Independence Party, which Mr. Golisano helped to create, and in the Conservative Party, where he is seeking to win the nomination by asking registered Conservatives to write his name on the ballot.
Initially, Mr. Golisano had planned a third strategy to get on the ballot -- forming yet another political party, the same method he used when he established the Independence Party eight years ago. To form a party, he would have had to secure the signatures of 15,000 registered voters in the state by last week. But Mr. Golisano said he had since abandoned that strategy.
"The reason for it is that we've seen the polling numbers and we are very confident where we're going with these two primaries," he said. "So, it was just a needless expense, a needless effort at this point."
His best chance of securing a position on the ballot, he said, remained in the Independence Party primary. "If we were betting people, we would say that the odds on the Conservative Party are slightly higher against us than they would be in the Independence Party," Mr. Golisano said. "That's because it's a write-in vote, and in the Independence Party, there is high name recognition for me."
Mr. Pataki's aides, meanwhile, have discounted that assessment, suggesting that the governor remains as popular with registered members of the two parties as he does with the general electorate.
Mr. Golisano, a businessman from Rochester, has committed himself to spending as much as $70 million in his campaign. He has spent millions on television ads and said he has poured campaign literature into the homes of voters in the two parties whose nominations he hoped to win.
"Your mailbox makes your television look insignificant," he said. The Golisano campaign, he said, is sending campaign literature to the registered members of the two parties at a rate of two to three pieces each week. "It's a significant amount of mailing," he said. "It's serious."
The governor, Mr. Golisano said, responding to a question about the Golisano campaign goals, "has created an environment that been very negative for most of the state relative to job creation, general economy and prosperity."
Mr. Golisano insisted that his criticisms of Mr. Pataki were so prominent "because I'm running in two primaries against him." But he added that, should he prevail and face Mr. Pataki on the Republican line as well as either Andrew Cuomo or H. Carl McCall on the Democratic line, things will change. "For now, it's first things first. But within a few weeks, nobody will doubt that we'll be running hard against all of them."

Classic-Car Crazy in California: Gentlemen, Strut Your Engines

BYLINE:  By NICK MADIGAN 

DATELINE: PEBBLE BEACH, Calif., Aug. 18 

 BODY:
Some are rendered mute. Others giggle, as though they cannot quite believe what they are seeing.
 Champagne glasses in hand, the thousands of people streaming past the impeccable Duesenbergs, Lagondas, Talbot-Lagos and Bugattis lined up by the waterfront here for the annual Concours d'Elegance -- an auto show so regal they named it in French -- are a case study in stupefaction, an audience in awe of some of the most beautiful cars ever made. 
 "It's so sexy," said Jim Catchot, an executive for a produce company from nearby Carmel, as he gazed at a 1951 Ferrari 212 Export Vignale Spyder that later won the prize for most elegant sports car. "I can see myself cruising down Highway 1 in it." 
But such dreams are the stuff of daily life only for a heady mix of well-heeled collectors of vintage and classic cars who make Pebble Beach the climax of their annual tour of such events. Even the regulars were impressed.
"This is tremendous art," said Ruth Buzzi, the actress who became known on "Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In" and whose husband, Kent Perkins, has 14 cars. "It's fantastic. Where else could you see this?"
The Concours, established in 1950 as an adjunct to the motor races that were held for years on the dirt roads of what became the Pebble Beach golf resort, was the highlight of a four-day weekend of events here that included a 50-mile tour of the Monterey Peninsula by dozens of vintage vehicles, a series of classic-sports-car races and a handful of auctions at which collectors spent millions on rare automobiles. 
"When you have the ultra-rich competing against each other, it shows their ability to spend money," said Scott Gordon, a chemical engineer from San Francisco who has "six or seven old cars," mostly Mercedes-Benzes and BMW's. "This is a whole other tier."
The main event here, in which 110 cars, much like purebred dogs, vied for Best in Show and a panoply of other prizes, took place this afternoon. A long line of stunning cars, some sputtering and belching smoke, others silent as night, ambled past the Pebble Beach Lodge as a thousand cameras clicked. To a fanfare of horns and the popping of fireworks, the top prize went to a 1934 Avions Voisin C-25 Saliot roadster, with an ostrich hide interior, owned by Sam Mann of Englewood, N.J., who had won here twice before with other cars.
"This is in essence our art collection," said Mr. Mann's wife, Emily, referring to the couple's cars. "It's like rolling sculpture."
Beyond the glamour of the Concours, much attention was devoted to the weekend's auctions, in which the uncertain economy seemed to have played some role. A 1962 Ferrari 330 TRI/LM, the last to be built in the Testa Rossa series, had been widely expected to fetch $7 million to $9 million at an auction on Saturday but brought in $5.9 million. The price was still spectacular, but some people were actually disappointed.
"I'm surprised at the prices -- they're a little low," said Lee Wolterding, a mortgage lender and Jaguar fan from nearby Carmel, even though he had just watched a 1954 Maserati Sport Spider sell for a cool $500,000 at another auction. "But there are a lot of people who have plenty of dough."
So it would seem, although most classic-car owners who were simply showing off their cars and not looking to sell them were reluctant to discuss the value of their vehicles.
"It's worth a lot of money -- that's all I can say," said Jules Heumann, owner of a gleaming black and gray 1930 Hispano-Suiza H6C with a boat-tail body.
Around him, people jostled for a better view, not just of the cars but of one another. Like the horse races at Ascot, the Pebble Beach car show prompts women to promenade. Feathered hats and period costumes abounded, although the overcast skies and a breeze from the Pacific, common to the Monterey Peninsula, made for trouble.
"The hardest thing is finding outfits for all this," said Eva Gordon, who has attended the show with her husband, Scott, the chemical engineer, for six consecutive years. "You dress for California but you've got to keep warm. I mean, you've got to have a hat."
If car-collecting is a male-dominated pastime, the women make do with providing the extra allure.
"I enjoy being the fluff on this," said Patty Queen, whose husband, John R. Queen, brought his 1952 Ferrari 212 Europa cabriolet to the event. "I call these cars bonbons, although I don't usually drive them. If something were to happen, it would happen while I was driving. But if he's cleaning this one, I'm good at giving directions: 'You missed a spot, you know.' "
By the same token, the men know not to act rashly on their passion for cars without their wives' approval.
Ray Lintott, who owns a Porsche dealership in Sydney, dropped $55,000 on a 1955 Porsche 356 Speedster at an auction on Saturday and looked a little uncertain afterward as he surveyed his bright red purchase with his wife, Penny.
"I'm still not sure I did the right thing," Mr. Lintott said. "But my wife didn't say no."

HEADLINE: A G.O.P. Power and His Penny-Stock Boards 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
First there was a lottery company that tried to sell socks bearing the likeness of the actor James Dean and that now makes coatings and sealants from recycled tires.
 Then came the gambling company with financial problems whose principals were recently indicted on charges of bank fraud and tax evasion. 
 Next was an electrical-equipment distributor that metamorphosed into a cash-poor operator of Eastern European health clinics.
It was followed by a golf-club maker that became an Internet marketer and, briefly, the distributor of a disease-fighting Korean nasal spray.
Finally, there was the company that claimed to be selling building blocks in India and, after Sept. 11, announced that it had products to thwart terrorists -- until regulators stepped in. And last week, federal prosecutors unsealed a securities fraud indictment of the company's former chairman. 
All these businesses share the financial losses, troubled track records and shape-shifting business plans that are the hallmarks of penny stocks, the low-priced shares that flourish on the shady side of Wall Street.
And they share another thing: Charles A. Gargano has served on their boards of directors, while also serving as chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation.
Empire State Development is responsible for doling out millions of dollars in state aid to businesses, a point noted by state legislators who questioned Mr. Gargano's business dealings when he was appointed in 1995. A close adviser to Gov. George E. Pataki and a major fund-raiser for the Republican Party, Mr. Gargano has also become an important force in the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan through his role at Empire State and as vice chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
Through a spokesman, Mr. Gargano declined to comment on his corporate activities. "We're not going to have much to say," said the spokesman, Michael Marr, who works for Empire State Development. Mr. Marr said that Mr. Gargano was no longer on any boards.
While it is not illegal for someone to lend his prestige to a tiny, troubled company, it is unusual for someone with an important government position to do so. And it remains unclear why Mr. Gargano would be willing to risk his reputation by becoming involved in shaky companies, at least one of which has been accused of defrauding the public.
Mr. Gargano appears to have been acquainted with several of the businessmen who ran the companies, two of whom have donated heavily to the Republican Party. He also received stock or other securities for his board membership, though it is unclear how much money these were worth or if he sold them.
He listed all but one of these positions, at a company called Eagle Building Technologies, on the annual disclosure forms he filed with the New York State Ethics Commission. The commission discloses investigations only if it finds "reasonable cause" to believe that someone has violated the ethics rules, said Walter C. Ayres, its director of communications. The commission has never issued such a finding in connection with Mr. Gargano, he said.
Asked about Mr. Gargano's corporate affiliations, a spokesman for Mr. Pataki said the governor had confidence in Mr. Gargano. "Charles Gargano has been an outstanding economic development leader, from Long Island to New York City and throughout upstate," said the spokesman, Joseph Conway.
Mr. Marr said Mr. Gargano resigned from Eagle last Oct. 12. (His membership there was first reported by The New York Post in April.) And since he was appointed chairman of Empire State in 1995, Mr. Marr said, Mr. Gargano "has attended no board meetings for any company."
In the wake of widespread corporate scandals, Congress, regulators and average Americans have become increasingly critical of figurehead directors who serve on boards. In theory, directors represent a company's owners -- its shareholders -- and keep an eye out for things like accounting irregularities, stock manipulation and executives with their hands in the corporate cookie jar.
Small and shaky companies are often willing to pay well-known people to sit on their boards without doing any work, because their presence helps attract investors, regulators say. "That's going to change now -- probably about 10 years later than it should have," said Joseph P. Borg, director of the Alabama Securities Commission and president of the North American Securities Administrators Association.
Executives at several of the companies in question confirm Mr. Marr's statement that Mr. Gargano did not attend board meetings; indeed, they said, he did not involve himself at all. "He was an absentee player, basically," said Dr. Michael Mitchell, a pediatrician and chairman of LCS Golf, where Mr. Gargano became a director in January 1999.
Meyer A. Berman has served on the board of Eagle since February 2001 and is now chairman (he has bought more than 40 percent of Eagle's stock and says he is turning the company around). Mr. Gargano was not involved in the company, Mr. Berman said, "Not at all, that I guarantee you."
Mr. Berman added, "He never attended a board meeting."
Other executives said that Mr. Gargano gave them advice and served as a sounding board. "I relied on his judgment," said Salvatore Zizza, a former construction executive and longtime friend of Mr. Gargano's, who ran Lehigh Group, the electrical supplies company. Mr. Gargano was a director from December 1994 through July 1997, when the company merged with the health clinic operator.
Clearly, Mr. Gargano lent cachet to otherwise unprepossessing outfits, like Urecoats, the lottery company turned coatings maker. Richard J. Kurtz, a New Jersey real estate executive and stock investor who became chairman of the company in early 1999, said that previously, "The only legitimate part of the company was Charles Gargano, to be candid, and the product." Mr. Gargano joined the company's board in 1993, when it was called Winners All, and resigned in August 1999.
Mr. Kurtz and Dr. Mitchell are among several people who turn up more than once in the companies linked to Mr. Gargano, as executives or directors or investors.
Another is Anthony M. D'Amato, the former chairman of Eagle Building, who was sued along with the company in March by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which accused him of securities fraud. The company sells masonry building blocks. According to the S.E.C. lawsuit, Mr. D'Amato fabricated millions of dollars of sales in India during 2000 and 2001, while Mr. Gargano was on the board. In fact, the company had no operations in India, the S.E.C. says.
After Sept. 11, the S.E.C. said, Eagle began issuing false press releases, claiming that it had equipment that could detect explosives and illegal drugs in airports, claims that the Federal Aviation Administration says are untrue.
While the company has settled with the S.E.C., Mr. D'Amato, in his recent answer to the complaint, cited his Fifth Amendment privileges against self-incrimination.
Mr. D'Amato, who left Eagle in February, has an unlisted telephone number in Boca Raton, Fla., and could not be reached for comment; his lawyer did not return repeated telephone calls.
On Thursday, federal prosecutors in Miami unsealed an indictment charging Mr. D'Amato with securities fraud, contending that he paid kickbacks to crooked buyers of Eagle stock in December and January, after Mr. Gargano says he left the board. It was unclear Friday if he had hired a criminal lawyer or entered a plea.
In the past, Mr. D'Amato was president of a company called Winner's Edge.Com, now Sealant Solutions. The current president of that company was indicted along with Mr. D'Amato. According to his disclosure statements, Mr. Gargano has held stock in the company (formerly UC'NWIN) since 1995.
Mr. D'Amato has in recent years contributed large sums to the Republican Party, including $25,000 to the 2001 President's Dinner Committee. He is not related to Alfonse M. D'Amato, the former senator. 
Mr. Gargano received securities, and does not appear to have received cash, in return for his board services, according to the companies' filings with the S.E.C.
LCS Golf, for example, paid its directors' fees in stock, which while Mr. Gargano was on the board was worth almost $4 a share, though recently it has been going for about 7 cents. Last August, Mr. Gargano owned 500,000 shares, according to company filings.
In his filings to the State Ethics Commission, Mr. Gargano said he owned an undisclosed amount of LCS restricted stock. Restricted stock -- shares that are received directly from a company without a public offering -- must be held for at least a year and can be sold only in limited circumstances.
According to Eagle's annual report for the year 2000, Mr. Gargano owned more than 33,000 shares. Before he resigned, the company's shares climbed to more than $8; earlier this year, they soared to more than $12 before plunging to 25 cents after the fraud allegations surfaced, and recently rose to about $3.
Questions have been raised before about Mr. Gargano's business practices.
An engineer by training, he became a senior executive at J. D. Posillico Inc., a major construction company on Long Island. In 1981, the company was accused of rigging bids on a sewer contract; it eventually paid $315,000 to settle a lawsuit, though it did not admit wrongdoing. 
A two-year criminal investigation into whether Mr. Gargano had done favors for political contributors ended in January 2001 when the Manhattan district attorney's office issued an unusual public statement saying that no charges would be pressed.
Then there was Alpha Hospitality, where he became a director in 1993. He resigned in September 1995 and sold his stock after state legislators complained about what they saw as conflicts of interest. Alpha is trying to open a casino with the St. Regis Mohawk tribe in upstate New York.
Even when Mr. Gargano was on Alpha's board, there were signs of trouble at the company, which was heavily in debt and losing money. Its president, Monty D. Hundley, resigned in March 1995 for what the company said were personal reasons -- and after the Indiana Gaming Commission asked to see his tax returns. In fact, Mr. Hundley had not filed federal income tax returns after 1981, according to an indictment prosecutors filed earlier this year in Federal District Court in Manhattan. The 21-count indictment accuses him; Stanley S. Tollman, the company's former chairman; and several associates of engaging in a complex $42 million scheme to defraud banks and avoid taxes. 
Lawyers for both men did not return telephone calls. Mr. Hundley has entered a plea of not guilty; Mr. Tollman, a major Republican Party contributor who resigned from Alpha in February, is a fugitive, said a spokesman for the United States attorney's office in Manhattan.
Since March, investors have filed a raft of lawsuits against Eagle, Mr. D'Amato and, in one case, all the directors including Mr. Gargano. Last month, a federal judge in West Palm Beach, Fla., consolidated the suits into one class-action complaint, and the lawyers have a few weeks to figure out how many defendants there will be. It is not yet known if Mr. Gargano will be one.

HEADLINE: A Debate, or a Tag-Team Match? Both Democrats Go After Pataki 

BYLINE:  By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD 

 BODY:
The Democratic candidates for governor met in their first debate yesterday, and for one hour steadfastly avoided attacking each other, agreeing on several key issues and reserving any ire for Gov. George E. Pataki.
 Indeed, the debate between the two candidates, State Comptroller H. Carl McCall and Andrew M. Cuomo, the former federal housing secretary, showed the extent to which both sides see the Sept. 10 primary campaign as the opening salvo of the general election battle against Mr. Pataki. The governor, a Republican, has a large lead over either Democrat in opinion polls and also has outpaced them in fund-raising. 
 In the first of at least four planned debates, Mr. McCall and Mr. Cuomo sat on stools at WCBS-TV in Midtown, separated by the moderator, Marcia Kramer, the station's political correspondent. Not very much separated the candidates on a range of issues, though.
With several polls showing Mr. McCall leading, it appeared that Mr. Cuomo had more to gain from the debate, though it was uncertain how many viewers would be watching on a hot, mid-August Sunday at 11 a.m. just after the third-rated weekend morning talk show, "Face the Nation." (The debate was also shown on C-Span and at least one upstate affiliate, in Albany, planned to broadcast it.)
Candidates who are trailing often resort to negative tactics to give voters a reason not to favor the front-runner, but with 23 days until the primary, Mr. Cuomo appeared somewhat restrained, reflecting his campaign's quandary.
He must tread carefully, because voters are already inclined to dislike him, according to several public opinion polls, and the looming anniversary of Sept. 11 has lead many political strategists to suggest that campaign sniping would be out of step with the public mood.
Yesterday, in contrast to his behavior on the campaign trail, where he is often animated and sometimes agitated, Mr. Cuomo mostly sat still, his hands clasped before him for nearly the entire debate, hardly raising his voice, and needling and joshing Ms. Kramer more than his opponent.
The only sign of tension came when Ms. Kramer asked the candidates to say something nice about one another.
Mr. McCall, who has been endorsed by the State Democratic Party and sees Mr. Cuomo's candidacy as something of an insult, shifted in his seat before answering, "He will say nice things about himself. Let me talk about myself, all right?" explaining that he preferred focusing on his platform.
Mr. Cuomo would only say, "He is a good man," adding, "I agree with Carl; it's not really about Carl personally or me personally."
Instead, over and over the candidates said they agreed on a range of issues, including preserving the $1.50 subway fare in New York City and keeping the Staten Island Ferry free. During the debate, both candidates said they would restore a fee on the ferry, but afterward both camps said the candidates did not understand the question and in fact opposed a fee.
Both faulted Mr. Pataki's handling of the sluggish upstate economy, an issue that has benefited Democrats in the past two statewide elections, and refused to endorse tax increases to close budget deficits.
But they hedged a bit on ruling out tax increases entirely. "I'm not going to raise taxes," Mr. McCall said. "The people are overburdened." But a moment later, he elaborated by saying that taxes were "the last thing we should think about."
In talking about closing the deficit, Mr. Cuomo, too, initially said, , "We have to do it without taxes, Marcia, because we're going to chase businesses from the state and that's the last thing we can do."
But in agreeing with Mr. McCall that he would not reinstate the commuter tax -- a levy abolished in 1999 that had been imposed on people who work in New York City but live outside of it -- Mr. Cuomo said he sees "new taxes as a last resort."
One intriguing moment came when the candidates addressed the death penalty, an issue that helped Mr. Pataki deny Mr. Cuomo's father, former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, a fourth term in 1994. Mr. Pataki campaigned on a pledge to reinstate capital punishment, which Mr. Cuomo had refused to do. "The death penalty has always been a red herring in a campaign," Andrew Cuomo said.
"They voted against Mario Cuomo, now we have the death penalty," he added.
"How many people has George Pataki put to death? Let's take out a calculator. In eight years that we needed this so desperately, how many people has he put to death? Zero."
Still, neither Mr. Cuomo nor Mr. McCall said they would seek to repeal the death penalty and would weigh signing death warrants on a case-by-case basis.
Some differences did emerge.
In a lightning round in which the candidates were supposed to give yes or no answers, Mr. McCall said he opposed using public money to build a stadium on the West Side of Manhattan, which proponents of bringing the 2012 Olympics to the city see as crucial.
Mr. Cuomo replied, "Maybe." Later, he said he would support it if it was tied to the Olympics bid.
They argued over whether the state comptroller certifies the state budget, when Mr. Cuomo suggested that the budget passed by the Legislature and signed by Mr. Pataki was not in balance because of its reliance on one-time revenues and use of reserve funds. It was one of the few times they engaged each other.
The disagreement continued afterward among their aides, with Mr. Cuomo's camp distributing copies of the law explaining how the budget is approved. It says the comptroller must determine that the budget appropriation bills "are sufficient for the ongoing operation and support of state government." Mr. McCall's camp insisted that does not mean "certify."
Both candidates took the opportunity to play up their campaign themes. Mr. Cuomo said "New York State government has been asleep" for eight years, failing to attract businesses to boost the economy. Mr. McCall noted the role of education in his rise out of an impoverished childhood, saying "I want to use that education now to help our children have the same opportunity I had."
The next debates are Aug. 28 on public radio station WNYC; Aug. 29 on a Rochester television station and Sept. 8 on WNBC-TV. Mr. Cuomo has also accepted debate invitations from WABC-TV and one sponsored by NY1 News and The New York Times, but Mr. McCall has not decided if he will participate.
Toward the end of yesterday's debate, there were a few light moments. When Ms. Kramer noted that Mr. Pataki had received endorsements from former Mayor Ed Koch and several Hispanic and black public figures, including New York Giants running back Tiki Barber, Mr. Cuomo interjected.
"Tiki Barber," he said, smiling, as if surprised, "I didn't know that."
Mr. McCall chimed in, "Boy, that's a good one."
"He and Ed Koch," he added. "That will get you elected."

HEADLINE: In Georgia, a Race Too Close to Call 

BYLINE:  By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Aug. 18 

 BODY:
No one would confuse the leafy suburban streets of Georgia's Fourth Congressional District with a seaside boulevard in Tel Aviv or with the dusty roads that crisscross the West Bank.
 But the issues of war and peace in the Middle East may be what decide the primary on Tuesday between two African-American women battling for the Democratic nomination for this district's seat in the House. Recent polls suggest that the race between Representative Cynthia A. McKinney, a five-term incumbent who has received substantial financial backing from Arab-Americans, and Denise Majette, a former state judge supported by pro-Israel groups, is too close to call. 
 "This is turning into a small proxy war -- a little, Middle East proxy war," said Khalil E. Jahshan, executive vice president of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee in Washington. 
The group's political action committee is urging its members to support Ms. McKinney, who is being opposed by pro-Israel groups because of her support for Arab causes. "One can raise all sorts of legitimate questions about McKinney's position on this or that issue, but she has been articulate on our concerns," Mr. Jahshan said.
Ms. McKinney has received campaign contributions from Arab-Americans around the country, including several who have come under scrutiny by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for possible terrorist links. Some of her contributors turned up as defendants in a $1 trillion lawsuit filed last week in Washington by families of Sept. 11 victims; the suit accuses them of being "enablers of terrorism." 
Ms. Majette has received donations from Jews from outside Georgia, raising almost twice as much over all as Ms. McKinney, more than $1.1 million versus about $640,000 for the incumbent. The challenger has accused Ms. McKinney of taking money from "people who have been named as Arab terrorists." 
Ms. McKinney and her spokesmen, who did not return phone calls for comment, have defended the contributions as legal, and have suggested there is no need to return the money. 
If Ms. McKinney loses, she will be the second House Democrat to be defeated this year in a race in which Middle East politics, and the influence of campaign contributions from both Arab-Americans and Jewish Americans, have played a significant role. Representative Earl F. Hilliard, an Alabama Democrat who has also supported Arab and Muslim concerns, was ousted in a primary vote in June by Artur Davis, a candidate backed by pro-Israel groups. 
The races in Alabama and Georgia are seen as evidence of new strains between African-Americans and Jewish Americans, who for decades were seen as unshakable political allies, given their shared history of discrimination. "Unfortunately, this is symptomatic of the tensions between the black and Jewish communities," said Abraham H. Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League in New York, which is traditionally aligned with Jewish and pro-Israel groups. 
But, Mr. Foxman said, it made sense that Jewish Americans would want to contribute to efforts to replace Ms. McKinney and Mr. Hilliard because of the lawmakers' records on matters of interest to the Jewish community.
Ms. McKinney, a 47-year-old educator-turned-politician with a liberal voting record and a confrontational style, is known in Congress for statements that border on the outrageous. 
After Sept. 11, she suggested that President Bush ignored warnings of the attacks because a war on terrorism would be good for businesses allied with the Bush family. Senator Zell Miller, a fellow Georgia Democrat, described her accusations as "looney." Last fall, she apologized to a Saudi prince whose $10 million donation of relief aid to New York City was rejected by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani because of the prince's assertion that American foreign policy was partly to blame for the attacks. 
Although her suburban Atlanta district is mostly black, Ms. McKinney has a sizable Jewish constituency, and Jewish voters here are alarmed by her support for Arab and Muslim causes. Their anxiety almost certainly grew with the announcement that Louis Farrakhan, the Nation of Islam leader who has been accused of anti-Semitism, intended to campaign for Ms. McKinney in Atlanta in the final days of the race. 
In a recent appearance before the Islamic Foundation in Chicago, Ms. McKinney pleaded for support. "It's just not about a Congressional district," she said. "It's about the members of Congress who have the courage to come to the Muslim community." 
She and Mr. Hilliard were among 21 members of the House who opposed a resolution in support of Israel's military response to Palestinian suicide bombings. 
Her list of contributors reflects her support for Arab causes. A sizable number of the names on the contribution lists she has provided to the Federal Election Commission are those of Arab-Americans from outside Georgia, many of them respected lawyers, physicians and merchants. 
Her opponents say they are concerned with the donations to Ms. McKinney from several people who have come under investigation for financial ties to terrorist organizations, including Al Qaeda. Among her donors is Abdurahman Alamoudi, the leader of a Muslim organization who has expressed support for Hezbollah, the Lebanese-based terrorist group, and Hamas, the violent Palestinian group; he has contributed the maximum $2,000 to Ms. McKinney's campaign. Mr. Alamoudi was among the McKinney donors who were named in the suit last week by the Sept. 11 families. Some other McKinney donors are connected to Muslim charities that have been accused of raising money for terrorist groups. 
In recent weeks, campaign officials have been quoted as saying that the donations in question would not be returned. "We don't racially profile our contributors," Ms. McKinney said in a debate this month. "All of our contributions are legal." 
Ms. Majette, 47, a Brooklyn-born, Yale-educated lawyer, has tried to distance herself from the perception that she is the candidate solely of pro-Israel groups. Her campaign manager, Roland Washington, said in an interview that issues involving the Middle East would not be Ms. Majette's focus in Congress. 
"Denise is pro-peace as it relates to the Middle East," Mr. Washington said. "But she is much more concerned with the local issues that are driving voters to look for an alternative to the current leadership. The campaign's focus is on economic development, infrastructure, child care, trying to reduce the cost of health care." 
Her campaign has drawn financial support from other prominent Democrats, including Senator Miller, and from other local celebrities, including Henry Aaron, the former Atlanta Braves star.

HEADLINE: Critic's Notebook; 
Art in Ashes, Drama in Dust

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN 

 BODY:
Leave it to someone who had no intention of making art to show what good memorial art looks like. 
 David Cohen is the owner of Chelsea Jeans, a clothing store on Broadway near Fulton Street, a block from where the World Trade Center used to be. The terrorist attack on Sept. 11 smashed his front window. He had to get rid of almost everything in the store. But he decided to keep a corner of the place intact. 
 He spent about $10,000 sealing more than $1,000 worth of Ralph Lauren sweaters and shirts and Levi jeans, covered with the pulverized remains of the twin towers, behind glass, creating a 50-square-foot, ready-made diorama of ground zero. 
His efforts resulted is the city's most artful shrine to Sept. 11.
But now Chelsea Jeans is about to close because of post9/11 economic blues, and the question is what will happen to this memorable memorial?
To put it together, Mr. Cohen moved a couple of racks slightly to fit them into the display but otherwise left things as they were when the impact of the blasts ruined his store. The clothes are still neatly hung and piled; they look like lined-up headstones in this context. Tank tops and sweat shirts in different colors all are reduced to the same ashen shade by the thick, sickly coating of gray dust, as are the metal hangers and wood shelves; everything, that is, except for a few of the Ralph Lauren items emblazoned with American flags, a weird serendipity.
Below, dust also covers the floor, which is littered with scraps of paper, receipts and expense statements, blown from offices, including the offices of Cantor Fitzgerald, in the World Trade Center. By contrast with everything else along this tacky street of discount shops, sidewalk stalls and fast-food restaurants, now cleaned up as if nothing ever happened, the preserved shrine is a shock. In a busy neighborhood that couldn't afford to leave things as they were, it is a small, meticulous patch of arrested time. 
Behind a thin sheet of glass, this silent, airless relic has an effect that not even ground zero, vast and empty, has now, the clean-up project having erased much of what happened there. The homemade shrine, random and homely, brings the event to a human scale, the ugliness of the debris in particular belying the picturesque metaphor of blanketing snow that everyone liked to use last September.
Mr. Cohen's shrine was just one of the makeshift memorials that sprang up around the city after Sept. 11. The biggest, until wary officials dismantled it, was at Union Square, where people gathered day and night in a spontaneous demonstration of civic vitality when the city needed it most. Later the viewing platform at ground zero became a temporary shrine, again proving that nothing is more moving than an unmediated view of catastrophe and personal loss.
But time has passed. The industry of professional memorialization has inevitably kicked into gear. Now we await with trepidation the anniversary exhibitions, concerts and theatrical interpretations, and we read more and more about artists and architects competing over who will design the official memorial. Grief has become part of the economy of culture.
Meanwhile Mr. Cohen's store is to disappear by mid-September. He has taped a note to the window, below the "For Rent" sign and above the "Everything Must Go" notice. It says: "After the events of Sep. 11th 2001, which totally destroyed our store, we invested a lot of time and money in order to open our doors once again. We hoped that things would get better . . . but they didn't . . . and soon we will have to close our doors permanently. We are very sorry, we gave it our best shot, but now we will have to say goodbye. About our memorial for Sep. 11th? We don't know what to do with it but if you have any suggestions, I would love to hear from you."
He has heard from a few museums so far, including the New-York Historical Society. But he said they seemed interested only in saving parts of the shrine: a pity. It is the view of a whole slice of the city, the diorama intact, not a single dusty sweater or a few shirts, that still causes crowds to gawk as they pass Chelsea Jeans; rubber-necking being, like mourning and spiritual uplift, an unavoidable, maybe even necessary aspect of the process of remembering. 
Since the shrine was shown on television last year, Mr. Cohen said, customers have come from as far away as Germany. A few cynics predictably called the memorial a marketing ploy, so a while ago he pinned to the wall opposite the shrine a few newspaper clippings about the murder of his 13-year-old Israeli niece in March 1997. Keren Cohen was one of seven Israeli schoolchildren killed by Ahmed Mustafa, a Jordanian soldier who went berserk and opened fire on them while they were visiting a patch of land in the Jordan Valley known as the Island of Peace. Now the store is a kind of double shrine.
"We are a very close family," said Mr. Cohen, who is also Israeli. "I put that up about Keren to say that I myself am a victim of terrorism."
Since reopening last November, Mr. Cohen has also been trying to boost sales by selling F.D.N.Y. caps and T-shirts with "No Fear" printed on the front. Business is still business, after all. 
George Segal's sculptural installations came to mind the other day in front of Mr. Cohen's shrine: Segal's mute figures, preserved like the dead at Pompeii, all cast in white, are vaguely akin to the forlorn clothes covered with dust, except that the shrine is without artifice or aesthetic refinement. It is simply what was, the truth unadorned (notwithstanding a few cheap paper flags Mr. Cohen has hung in his diorama, increasing the artless effect).
That it continues to survive, for a few more weeks at least, in the midst of the usual commercial maelstrom, speaks to the messy reality of life in a city that suffered death. 
Perhaps some clever museum will now save what Mr. Cohen did.
"I wanted to preserve what we saw, what we smelled and lived through that day," he said. And he has.

HEADLINE: Mexico's Fox Proposes Opening Power Sector 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH MALKIN 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Aug. 18 

 BODY:
President Vicente Fox is asking Mexico's divided Congress to change the constitution in a bid to attract billions of dollars in private investment to its state-run electricity sector, a move so far opposed by a majority of legislators.
 The proposal would allow private investors to build power plants that would compete with the public Federal Electricity Commission to supply large industrial customers. The government estimates that Mexico needs investment of $5 billion a year over the next decade to modernize and expand the electricity sector to keep up with growing demand, money that would otherwise come from public spending. 
 "Imagine what we could do with these resources," Mr. Fox said before sending the bill to Congress late Friday. "I am sure we could resolve the enormous challenge of education. With these resources we could totally resolve the challenge of having an excellent health system with national coverage." 
Mexico's business community and foreign investors have long made the overhaul of the state's antiquated electricity sector a crucial test of Mr. Fox's ability to deliver substantive economic change. In the two years since his election ended the 71-year-old rule of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, Mr. Fox has been unable to win approval for any significant economic proposal. Another failure would diminish his stature ahead of midterm elections in 2003.
Legislators from the PRI and the center-left Party of the Democratic Revolution have promised to fight constitutional reform of the energy sector. A two-thirds vote from Congress is needed for a constitutional change, so Mr. Fox will need to lobby heavily to win the PRI's support. 
In April, a combined Senate committee voted to shelve earlier proposals for an overhaul, rejecting any possibility of a constitutional change. "There isn't going to be a constitutional reform," Senator Manuel Bartlett Diaz, a PRI stalwart, said.
Mr. Bartlett, as president of the Senate Committee on constitutional issues, leads the opposition to Mr. Fox's proposal. The electricity commission "is totally self-sufficient," said Mr. Bartlett, citing a litany of troubled Latin American electricity privatizations. "It has always had enough to keep up with Mexico's growth. It doesn't need foreign investment." However, the electricity commission says that its debt, backed by the Mexican government, represents 130 percent of its sales.
The PRI and P.R.D. have both presented proposals for revamping of the commission without recourse to private investment. The government argues that only private investment can meet the shortfall. Mexican per capita electricity consumption, at 1,997 kilowatt-hours a year, is less than one-sixth American consumption. "We want Mexico to shine like the U.S. and Europe," said the under secretary of energy, Niceforo Guerrero.
Legislators from Mr. Fox's National Action Party argue that reform is necessary. "If there is good lobbying, good work, then the reform is possible," Senator Juan Jose Rodriguez Prats, president of the Senate Energy Commission. "The PRI needs to take a decision. Otherwise, the government could blame the PRI for being obstructionist."
Indeed, some PRI members have said they are open to discussing constitutional reform.
An earlier proposal circulated last week that would have opened petroleum refining and natural gas production to private investment. Mexico needs to expand natural gas production to supply power plants. Mr. Fox's proposal backed off from asking for changes in the petroleum, but the energy secretary, Ernesto Martens, said today that he expected Mr. Fox to soon send a bill on natural gas to Congress.
Modernizing the electricity sector has bedevilled successive governments for a decade. A 1992 law opened up power generation to the private sector, but limited investors to building plants for self-supply or for sale to the electricity commission under long-term contracts. Since then, plants with 18,000 megawatts of capacity have been built or are under construction with $10 billion in private investment.
The electricity commission estimates that an additional 29,000 megawatts of capacity are needed by 2011 over the country's existing 37,000 megawatts at a cost of about $30 billion. At least that much again will be needed to expand the distribution grid, provide maintenance and improve distribution.
Despite the 1992 law, Mr. Fox's predecessor, Ernesto Zedillo, was concerned that investment was not flowing fast enough to meet demand, which is expected to grow at 5.5 percent a year. He proposed a complex reform in 1999 which would ultimately have led to the sale of the electricity commission and the much smaller money-losing Mexico City distributor Central Light and Power. It sank in Congress. In response, Mr. Fox has pledged to keep both companies in state hands.

HEADLINE: White House Letter; 
A Vacation That's More Politicking Than Ranching

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: CRAWFORD, Tex. 

 BODY:
The White House calls President Bush's 25-day idyll at his Texas ranch a "working vacation," a phrase a lot of people dismiss as Republican spin about a chief executive who -- like psychiatrists and the French -- takes off the entire month of August.
 Truth is, the president is working hard -- at politics. 
 From Aug. 1 through Sept. 1, Mr. Bush will have made political trips to 11 states, all of them places he narrowly won or lost to Al Gore in 2000, or where there is a critical House or Senate race that could affect Republican control of Congress. Most of the trips also feature fund-raisers where the president drops by a packed hotel ballroom of supporters for 30 minutes, bestows generous but similar words on a favored Republican candidate, then leaves $1 million or more in his wake. 
Although the official word from a White House spokeswoman is that the trips are to spread the president's sunny message about his attempts to lift the thick clouds over the economy, another White House official acknowledged the obvious last week.
"Our strategy was to get the fund-raising completed before the fall," the official said, "so we could spend more time with candidates before big crowds."
Mr. Bush's political travels for midterm candidates will only intensify this fall, when he will also get a head start on his own re-election campaign in 2004. 
Even Bill Clinton, the president who invented the permanent campaign, didn't have such a travel schedule during his August weeks on Martha's Vineyard. In fact, Mr. Bush will have had only about two weeks of down days in a month in Texas.
Consider his calendar. After a three-day early August weekend at his parents' summer home (where Mr. Bush's father drove him by speedboat up the Maine coast to a fund-raiser for Senator Susan Collins), the president returned to Washington on Monday via Pittsburgh, where he raised $1 million for Mike Fisher, the Pennsylvania attorney general and Republican candidate for governor. The next day Mr. Bush left the White House for Texas, where he was in place less than 18 hours before leaving for Mississippi and a $1 million fund-raiser for Representative Charles W. Pickering Jr. and the state's Republican Party.
Mr. Bush then paused for five days of jogging, clearing brush and golf. Rested, he resumed his fund-raising last Wednesday with a $600,000 lunch for Gov. Scott McCallum in Wisconsin and a $1.3 million event for Doug Gross, the Republican candidate for governor of Iowa. 
This week Mr. Bush is to dash off to three fund-raisers for Bill Simon, the imploding candidate for governor of California, and will also help collect big checks in Oregon and New Mexico. More fund-raisers come the following week in Oklahoma and Arkansas.
Like Mr. Clinton, Mr. Bush is not only phenomenally successful at raising cash, but seems to like doing it. His mood has been peppy as he has jetted, choppered and sped by boat and motorcade across the summer landscape of America. Last week he swept by Mount Rushmore in Marine One, the presidential helicopter, on a crystalline morning with the vista of the Black Hills lying below him. On another day he dropped down in the middle of the funnel cakes, sheep shearing and a cow sculptured from butter at the Iowa State Fair.
"I came off my ranch today in Crawford," Mr. Bush told the fairgoers. "There are not many places that would kind of lure me away, but the Iowa State Fair is one." He seemed to speak with real fervor when he declared, "God has blessed Iowa and the citizens of this great state." 
The president's advisers say the bad news on the economy and the divisions in Republican ranks over Iraq have not noticeably dented his spirits. "Since he stepped foot on his ranch, he's been in a great mood," said Dan Bartlett, the White House communications director who has worked for Mr. Bush since 1994.
The president himself said as much last Friday, when he spoke at a barbecue in Crawford, the one-stoplight town down the road from his ranch.
"We love it here," Mr. Bush told a group of Crawford residents who volunteer to help out with logistics when the president and his entourage ride into town. "There is nothing better than to get up early in the morning, and to go jogging across our ranch, see a couple of deer, talk to the turkeys." 
Mr. Bush added: "I get a lot of work done in Crawford. You know, it's hard for some to understand, but a decision-making process never ends when you're the president -- you're constantly being briefed and brought up to date on this, that or the other. And I still make decisions here, I just find that I can -- it's a different perspective when I come here, out of Washington, D.C."
Up to a point. As fast as you could say "soft money," Mr. Bush then ran off to a neighboring ranch to a Republican National Committee barbecue to persuade the party's richest donors to give even more.

HEADLINE: Taming the Untouchable Corps 

 BODY:
There are not many issues that the liberal Tom Daschle of South Dakota and the conservative Robert Smith of New Hampshire agree on. But when Congress reconvenes, these two senators, along with the campaign finance mavericks John McCain and Russell Feingold, are determined to challenge the self-interest of many of their colleagues by instituting a top-to-bottom overhaul of the Army Corps of Engineers. Their objectives are twofold. One is to make sure that the Army Corps' multibillion-dollar construction budget is spent on vital infrastructure, not wasteful pork-barrel projects ordered up by individual members of Congress. The other is to make sure the corps proceeds in an environmentally responsible manner.
 Anyone who cares about sound budgeting and about the health of America's rivers and wetlands should wish them well. The corps, a Pentagon organization with 35,000 civilian employees, is basically the nation's master builder, a giant engineering firm devoted to straightening rivers, building canals and levees, managing dams, dredging harbors and replenishing beaches. Defiantly independent, answerable mainly to its Congressional paymasters, the corps has tangled with nearly every president since Franklin Roosevelt, usually over spending. President Bush is no exception. He fired (and has yet to replace) Mike Parker, the agency's civilian chief, mainly because Mr. Parker asked for too much money. 
 This time the chances for reform seem unusually promising. Each week seems to bring fresh criticism of the corps' behavior. In April, the General Accounting Office found that the corps had vastly overestimated the economic payoff of a $300 million dredging project in the Delaware River -- the latest in a series of projects where the corps seems to have cooked the books to justify huge budget outlays. Then, last month, the National Academy of Sciences called for independent reviews of the corps' biggest projects. Even the agency's own civil works director, Maj. Gen. Robert Griffin, complained of shoddy economic and environmental analysis. 
On the environmental front, meanwhile, leading advocacy organizations -- American Rivers, Environmental Defense and Earth Justice -- have been drawing attention to the agency's ignoble history of environmental carelessness. Nearly two-thirds of the rivers on American Rivers' "most endangered" roster for this year made the list because of the damage to the riverine environment and habitat inflicted by corps projects.
To his credit, the new military commander, Lt. Gen. Robert Flowers, has made unusual efforts to reach out to critics. After the American Rivers report appeared, he toured the country to meet with citizens' groups and editorial boards, and has since embraced at least the idea of independent review and promised to pay more attention to environmental values. 
Defenders of the corps argue that in some cases the agency is merely serving higher authority. They note, for example, that it was not the corps but the Environmental Protection Agency that chose to continue the insane practice of dumping mining wastes into the valleys and streams of West Virginia. Similarly, they argue, it is not the corps but President Bush and Senator Christopher Bond of Missouri who have blocked a long-awaited plan to protect endangered species by restoring seasonal water flows to the Missouri River -- a once-flourishing waterway that has been channelized into a muddy ditch to serve a barge industry of trivial economic significance.
These arguments are, of course, deeply disingenuous, since they imply that the corps would do a more responsible job if left to its own devices. But while General Flowers may support change, the commanders at the district level, where key decisions are made, seem quite happy with the status quo. They are likely to stay that way until Congress requires fundamental changes in the corps' culture. Mr. Smith and Mr. Daschle would do just that.

HEADLINE: MANAGING PLANET EARTH: A CONVERSATION WITH/Daniel Botkin; 
Adjusting Attitudes on Energy To Keep Our Favorite Things

BYLINE:  By CLAUDIA DREIFUS 

 BODY:
Dr. Daniel B. Botkin, 64, a professor of biology at the University of California at Santa Barbara and the president of the Center for the Study of the Environment there, is one of the world's leading environmental researchers and has done much to popularize the concept of using yet maintaining the world's natural resources.
 "Discordant Harmonies: A New Ecology for the 21st Century," his 1990 book, published by the Oxford University Press, is considered by many ecologists to be the classic text of the movement. 

Q. It's been a decade since the United Nations' Earth Summit meeting in Rio de Janeiro, where the term sustainability was heard early and often. In the 10 years since Rio, have you seen much movement toward that "sustainable world" that was heralded so hopefully there?

A. The good news is there is a lot more talk about sustainability than ever. The bad news is about people doing things sustainably: nothing much has improved. What's also discouraging is that a lot of concern has wandered away from a solid scientific basis for sustainability and toward empty verbiage. The term has become so overused that it means vastly different things to different people.

Q. Give us Daniel Botkin's definition of sustainability.

A. First, we have to look at sustainability of a product -- for instance, timber. That's different from sustainability of an ecosystem. A natural resource like a forest is sustainable if it can regrow at the same rate that you harvest it, for a defined time period. An ecosystem is sustainable if when you affect it -- perhaps through harvesting or humans' hiking through it -- it can still sustain itself through a defined time period.

Q. Despite the increased discussion of sustainability, material consumption in the United States has escalated. The trend in new houses and cars is the bigger the better. Is it your view that Americans are in a kind of denial about nature's finiteness?

A. It's deeper than that. Few human societies have ever restrained their use of resources if they had the technology to overexploit them. But a lot of pro-sustainability efforts are still possible in America without reducing the standard of living. Let's talk specifics here. If Americans want trophy houses and big cars, you have to talk to them about energy policy. There are sustainable solutions to the energy problem. There's plenty of solar and wind energy right now. The technology exists. It's ready. You can buy it off the shelf.

Q. So why do we see so little use of sustainable energy like the sun and wind?

A. Well, I can tell you in California, where there's push to do this, the power companies lobby and get little riders on bills that make it unprofitable for people to use solar energy or to go into businesses that would make solar energy devices. There's a lot of industrial and political inertia based on a fossil fuel economy.
You have to break through that fossil fuel mind-set. When I talk to my friends in economics, they tell me that the conventional wisdom has it that solar and wind power are way off in the future and that nuclear is something we can use now. The facts are the opposite. So we have a cultural mind-set that drags us down. 

Q. Do you see Americans as too affluent to incorporate principles of sustainability into their everyday lives?

A. I don't think that affluence necessarily leads to nonsustainable practices. Nor is the converse necessarily true. There are poor aquaculture farmers in Malaysia, who destroy mangrove swamps to make shrimp ponds that will last only two or three years. It's human nature to think of the immediate need first. On the other hand, in a developed country like Norway, people there are very sustainability-conscious.
In terms of the United States, there's never been a movement for sustainability. You can't name a major political or cultural leader who has emerged as a spokesman for it. Sustainability is a much more fashionable word in international circles, in Europe, at worldwide centers like the United Nations Environment Program. 

Q. How do you rate the record of the Clinton-Gore administration on issues of sustainability?

A. A big disappointment. There were so many ways they could have worked toward sustainability. They didn't.

Q. And would you give us your view of the performance of the Bush administration on sustainability?

A. I wish they understood global warming. I wish they had an understanding of the energy situation. They don't understand that the technology for renewables is here now, that nuclear is no solution, that we must stop depending on foreign oil and that we can solve energy problems by going to solar and wind power.
Also, I think they are totally underestimating the importance of global warming as a risk. It has to be looked at in the same way you look at earthquakes and hurricanes. The question should not be, "Is global warming happening?" but rather, "What is the risk of global warming happening, and what are the consequences if it does?" You should act like you're buying an insurance policy against something you hope won't happen. The insurance premium would include reduction of greenhouse gases. 

Q. During the last 10 years, globalization brought wealth to corners of the world previously considered underdeveloped. Will these newly affluent countries be as profligate with resources as the United States and the rest of the industrialized world has been?

A. People have always been profligate with resources. But the facts here are clear. There aren't enough resources to go around for everybody to live at the level we in America live at. Somebody's going to have to give up something. But that's where we get into sustainable development in a meaningful way. One of the big questions of our time is, How can you have a good quality of human life, physically and spiritually that uses fewer resources per person?

Q. You speak of people needing a new mind-set. What exactly do you mean by that?

A. My belief is that we will not attain sustainability until we learn to love both nature and people. To love nature, you have to find a way to make a deep connection with it. If more Americans felt more connected to nature, they would feel a bigger stake in policies that cut resource consumption. They wouldn't be as defensive about scaling back on big cars or other wasteful consumer items; they'd want to do it.

Q. As the delegates to the World Summit on Sustainable Development begin their deliberations, what advice would you offer?

A. In the past, sustainability advocates have mostly talked about sustaining one product or resource. In these new times, I would hope that they turn their attention toward creating sustainable livelihoods in a context with ecosystems that are also sustained. We have to think about people and nature as one.

Experts Scaling Back Their Estimates of World Population Growth

BYLINE:  By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

 BODY:
Demography has never been an exact science. Ever since social thinkers began trying to predict the pace of population growth a century or two ago, the people being counted have been surprising the experts and confounding projections. Today, it is happening again as stunned demographers watch birthrates plunge in ways they never expected.
 Only a few years ago, some experts argued that economic development and education for women were necessary precursors for declines in population growth. Today, village women and slum families in some of the poorest countries are beginning to prove them wrong, as fertility rates drop faster than predicted toward the replacement level -- 2.1 children for the average mother, one baby to replace each parent, plus a fraction to compensate for unexpected deaths in the overall population. 
 A few decades ago in certain countries like Brazil, Egypt, India and Mexico fertility rates were as high as five or six. 
As a result, United Nations demographers who once predicted the earth's population would peak at 12 billion over the next century or two are scaling back their estimates. Instead, they cautiously predict, the world's population will peak at 10 billion before 2200, when it may begin declining.
Some experts are wary of too much optimism, however. At the Population Council, an independent research organization in New York, Dr. John Bongaarts has studied population declines in various countries over the last half century. He questions the assumption that when fertility declines begin they will continue to go down at the same pace, especially if good family planning services are not widely available.
Sharp fertility declines in many industrialized and middle-income countries had already challenged another old belief: that culture and religion would thwart efforts to cut fertility. In Italy, a Roman Catholic country whose big families were the stuff of cinema, family size is shrinking faster than anywhere else in Europe, and the population is aging rapidly as fewer children are born. Islamic Iran has also had great success with family planning.
"Projections aren't terribly accurate over the long haul," said Dr. Nicholas Eberstadt, a demography expert at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington. "Demographers have been surprised by just about every big fertility change in the modern period. Demographers didn't anticipate the baby boom. They did not anticipate the subsequent decline in fertility in industrialized Western democracies."
What's next? Demographers can agree generally on a few measurable facts and some trends. The world's population, now 6.2 billion, quadrupled in the 20th century, and changed in drastic ways. In 1900, 86 percent of the world's people lived in rural areas and about 14 percent in urban areas. By 2000, urban communities were home to 47 percent of the population, with 53 percent still in the countryside.
Between now and 2030, when the global population is expected to reach about eight billion, almost all the growth will be in cities. But urbanization is not necessarily a bad thing for the environment, said Dr. Joseph Chamie, director of the United Nations' population division.
"Moving to cities frees up the land for forestry, agriculture and many other activities," Dr. Chamie said. "You're getting people concentrated, so you can probably recycle more easily. People change their lifestyles. The Indian moving from the boonies of Uttar Pradesh to the city of Lucknow gets educational opportunities, cultural opportunities, all sorts of political participation. He can be influenced by advertising and public relations campaigns. Immunization will be better, and family planning."
As births fall and lives are extended, the global population is getting older. The over-80 age group is the fastest growing.
But not everywhere. For example, the United Nations calculates that life expectancy at birth is being slashed in countries hardest hit by AIDS. In South Africa, the life of a baby born now should be 66 years; AIDS has cut that to 47. In Zimbabwe, the drop has been to 43 years from 69. In Botswana, it is 36 years, down from 70.
Another cautionary sign from projections is that where populations are continuing to grow fastest, societies and governments may be least likely to cope with the results, including strains on natural resources -- farmland, water, air, forests and animals.
Last year, the organization published a report and wall chart, "Population, Environment and Development," plotting and analyzing population changes as its contribution to the debate surrounding the Johannesburg summit meeting.
The United Nations estimates that the world's current population, 6.2 billion, is growing at an annual rate slightly over 1.2 percent, producing some 77 million people. Of this growth, 97 percent is taking place in less-developed countries, said Dr. Chamie, whose position at the United Nations makes him chief keeper of the world's statistics. Six nations will dominate this growth, and in this order: India, China, Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh and Indonesia.
Thus, though fertility is declining unexpectedly in a poor country like India, which has more than a billion people, the actual numbers continue to rise rapidly because the base is so large. India is gaining as many people annually as China, Pakistan and Nigeria combined, the United Nations says.
India is projected to have at least 100 million more people than China by 2050, even if China's one-child policy is relaxed. Small families are now the norm for the Chinese, whose standard of living has risen above that of the people of India by many measures.
Among industrialized countries, the United States alone has a growth rate comparable to that of developing nations. It now ranks seventh in growth, Dr. Chamie said, but 80 percent of that growth comes from immigration. In Europe, populations are shrinking, even with more immigration.
With much of the population bulge predicted in Asia, the East-West Center in Honolulu has just published a report, "The Future of Population in Asia," which finds cause to fear considerable environmental stress in a region where population densities and numbers are often great. Asia, the report notes, already has 56 percent of the world's population living on 31 percent of its arable land, and more than 900 million people exist on less than $1 a day.
"Asia faces the most acute pressure on arable agricultural land of any region in the world," the report says, adding that expansion of farmland has been made at the cost of forests. Acute water scarcity, a significant loss of biodiversity and more urban pollution seem inevitable. Twelve of the world's 15 most polluted cities are in Asia. By 2020, the report predicts, Asia will be producing more carbon dioxide emissions than any other region.
"When looking at current and future environmental concerns in Asia," the report concludes, "the number of people to be fed, clothed, housed, transported, educated and employed may not be the only issue, but it is an issue that cannot be ignored."

Economic Interests Keep Drive for Renewable Energy Stuck in Neutral

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE 

 BODY:
When it comes to world energy consumption, it is as if time has stood still for the last decade.
 People still rely mostly on fossil fuels to light their homes and run their cars, despite the environmental problems that flow from burning coal, oil and natural gas. At the same time, renewable energy sources, like the sun and the wind, still glimmer as the great alternatives -- clean, abundant and on the brink of mass production in a future that always seems around the corner yet perpetually out of reach. 
 Renewable energy sources, not including hydroelectric power, account for just 1 percent of the world's supply; fossil fuels provide about 85 percent, energy experts say. "The energy 'system' shows a substantial degree of inertia," said Joel Darmstadter, a senior fellow with Resources for the Future, a Washington environmental and economics research group. 
The continued reliance on fossil fuels will be one of the most confounding issues officials face when they gather in Johannesburg next week to discuss ways of developing economies without degrading the environment. One reason is that the main consequence of burning fossil fuels is an atmospheric buildup of carbon dioxide, the main heat-trapping gas linked to global warming. Yet global warming was scratched from the agenda of the summit meeting, largely at the insistence of the United States and oil-exporting nations.
The longstanding barriers to the shift from fossil fuels to renewables persist, and manufacturers and developers of the latter can only chip away at them. Solar and wind power are more expensive than fossil fuels, and even though their prices have fallen over the last decade, the average prices of coal, oil and natural gas have also stayed relatively low. Environmental groups say one reason these fuels remain cheap is that their price does not reflect the environmental damage they cause or the costs of defending supply lines.
Technological advances have damped the cost of renewable power sources, but technology has also kept down the cost of using fossil fuels and, in some instances, reduced their harmful effects on the environment.
"Even if there are rapid developments in renewables, by 2020 there is only a slim chance that they will be anything more than 5 to 10 percent of the world's energy supply," said John Mogford, group vice president of renewables and alternatives at BP, the world's third-largest oil company.
The comforts and advantages energy affords, from the illumination of schools to the refrigeration of vaccines, can clearly spur prosperity. But as societies flourish, they demand more energy. Most of the world's fuel is consumed by the rich, industrialized nations. Based on annual per capita energy consumption, the United States is near the top of the list with 354 million British thermal units and Western Europe with 170 million, whereas India uses 12 million, a report by Mr. Darmstadter says.
That gap may narrow. By 2050, the world may be using 15 times as much energy as it did in 1950, said Phil Watts, the chairman of Royal Dutch/Shell. But most of that increased consumption will probably come from developing countries, he predicted.
Perhaps as much as many environmentalists, the oil companies are eager to find alternatives to fossil fuels because they understand that over the next century they will see their supply dwindling. There are enough proven reserves for oil to last another 37 years or so; natural gas, another 61 years; and coal, 211 more years, according to the Edison Electric Institute, a trade group. Those supplies suggest that fossil fuels are still cheap and plentiful. But a push toward renewable energy, Mr. Mogford and others said, will not be set off by the end of oil, but by governments concerned about other issues, like climate change.
The major oil companies are to varying degrees researching and manufacturing renewable energy sources. The three biggest companies are divided on the effects of their products on global warming. ExxonMobil questions the science; BP and Royal Dutch/ Shell mostly accept it. But all are researching fuel cells and hydrogen as energy sources, although the economic feasibility of that technology remains years away.
In the meantime, BP and Shell are investing in solar and wind power, BP being the world's largest maker of the photovoltaic cells needed for solar power and Shell among the biggest developers of wind farms. Each is involved in outfitting remote villages in developing countries, far from the grid, with solar power systems.
The forays are ultimately driven by the bottom line. The oil companies are acutely aware of political and consumer winds. As people demanded fuels that were cheap but burned more cleanly, for instance, oil companies began to prospect for more natural gas and produce it, making it a major part of their businesses. Sales for solar energy systems have been growing by 20 percent to 40 percent a year in the last decade. Shell's wind business has grown exponentially, to 238 megawatts of projects from only 4 megawatts two years ago.
"Our customers want energy, and they don't necessarily care if that's from oil, gas, coal or renewables," said Robert Kleiburg, vice president of strategy and planning for Shell renewables. "So as an energy company, if we are active on the various technologies around, we stand a better chance of strategically 'being there' when those technologies take off."
Solar power, while cheaper than before, still costs about 20 cents a kilowatt- hour. Coal, by contrast, costs about 2 cents. Solar systems are expensive to build. BP makes enough solar equipment annually to produce about 70 megawatts of energy, an amount that even the company concedes is tiny. And that is the output of seven plants worldwide employing 1,500 people.
Research into a new technology called thin film photovoltaics could cut costs substantially for the whole industry, but mass production of that is not yet imminent.
Wind power has become competitive, but few people want the towering windmills of wind parks nearby, and the wind itself does not always blow.
Still, utilities in the United States and elsewhere are trying to incorporate a bit of wind into their energy mix. TXU, a major electricity company based in Dallas, has teamed with a developer building a wind farm to buy 240 megawatts of electricity, enough to keep the air-conditioners running in about 192,000 homes for a day.
TXU would take all the energy the wind farm generated at any given time, reducing the output from its natural-gas-fired plants and cutting emissions.
"The greatest advantage is that when the wind is blowing, you don't have to burn that extra ton of fuel," said Tom Rose, vice president of public policy at TXU. The other advantage, he noted, is that the price of wind power remains constant over the years.
The 624 total megawatts of renewable energy that TXU will have when the new wind farm begins operating in 2003 is still a fraction of the 22,000 megawatts the company delivers at peak times. But TXU hopes to increase the proportion gradually. Customers, Mr. Rose said, are starting to demand it, telling the utility in a poll four years ago that they were willing to pay more to use renewables and help the environment. TXU estimates that the wind energy costs about 5 cents a kilowatt-hour.
Hobart and William Smith Colleges in central New York, which focus on the liberal arts, have made that choice. They plan to use wind power for a new "green" building on campus. That move will increase electricity costs for the structure almost 22 percent.
So far, the decision is in the realm of personal virtue, a way for the colleges to show their commitment to the environment and to explore the trade-offs between cheap power and a cleaner environment. "The prices of renewables still have to fall significantly for their use to become widespread, especially as long as oil and natural gas are relatively cheap," said Dr. Thomas Drennen, a professor of economics and director of environmental studies at the colleges.
For renewables to thrive, governments have to step in, experts agree. The federal government, a huge purchaser of electricity, could buy more power from renewable sources, said Dr. James J. MacKenzie of the World Resources Institute, an environmental and economics research firm.
Ideally, Dr. MacKenzie and other environmentalists argued, countries will impose carbon charges on power generated by fossil fuels, reflecting the environmental damage they cause. But in the United States, Dr. MacKenzie said, "no one will go near that with a 10-foot pole."
Energy companies contend that rather than punishing consumers for using certain fuels, countries should reward them for turning to others. In Japan, Mr. Mogford of BP said, the government has given incentives and tax breaks for building solar-powered buildings.
"We can only lower the costs so much," he said. "Until policy makers change societal priorities, renewables will develop at quite a slow pace."

As Alien Invaders Proliferate, Conservationists Change Their Focus

BYLINE:  By ANDREW C. REVKIN and CAROL KAESUK YOON

 BODY:
On a human-dominated planet, it is only natural that wilderness and wildlife will be increasingly disrupted, hemmed in or exterminated.
 That has been happening steadily through the era of industrialization, which created today's wealthy minority, and will happen far more, biologists say, as the developing world strives to become developed. 
 In the face of this trend, conservationists and scientists have tried a host of strategies to preserve the world's shrinking mosaic of untrammeled ecosystems: establishing parks; pushing for laws protecting endangered species; publicizing "biodiversity hot spots," places where wilderness and people dangerously overlap.
But on almost every front, they find themselves falling back, like an army under surprise attack from within and without. Nothing is simple any more, many scientists lament. Even the definition of "wild" is open to debate. 
With some species fading and others in transit, the experts have to decide simultaneously which wildlife to protect and which to get rid of.
Accelerating trade and migration have resulted in large-scale invasions of islands and continents by new species and the disruptions of longstanding ecological regimes that many naturalists have long treasured. An entire field, restoration ecology, has arisen to defend "native" species against "alien" invaders.
Hawaii's birds exemplify the problem, falling to extinction one by one, besieged by pigs, rats, cats and other imports.
On the East Coast, marshes of native cordgrass have become overgrown with an exotic species, the common reed. Restoration ecologists had once hoped to return these marshes to a self-sustaining population of cordgrass, but have instead been fighting a continuous and, some say, losing battle against the hardy reed.
"You have to keep herbiciding," said Dr. Joy B. Zedler, a restoration ecologist at the University of Wisconsin. "You have to keep spraying it year after year, and the minute you stop it'll come back in."
So a growing chorus of biologists is proposing a new approach to the fast-blending biosphere. They say change should be accepted as largely inevitable and choices for managing nature should be based on what is desirable and undesirable, not what is native and foreign.
Altogether, researchers estimate that 50,000 species have invaded the United States as a result of human activities. North America, as a result, has 20 percent more plant species now than it did before colonization, biologists say.
"They're not going back," said Dr. Mark A. Davis, an ecologist at Macalester College in St. Paul who has been exhorting colleagues to stop viewing nonnatives as necessarily bad since, he says, most are harmless.
He suggests accepting these species as the new immigrants -- a biological reflection of the same globalization affecting economies, societies and information.
"It's never-ending to try to keep a habitat pure," he said, "You're fighting natural processes at some point."
But many of his fellow ecologists are appalled.
"If we ignore this, it gets us gypsy moths and chestnut blight and any number of other ecological disasters that greatly reduce our flexibility for future options and reduce the beauty of the natural world," said Dr. Guy McPherson, an ecologist at the University of Arizona, echoing others. 
Some 400 of the 1,000 or so species that are listed as endangered are thought to be at risk, primarily because of competition or predation from nonnative species, Dr. McPherson added.
While that is indeed thought to be the case, Dr. Davis said, few rigorous studies document such effects.
Dr. Davis said the real villain driving extinction rates around the world was loss of habitat. Instead of focusing on native or alien, Dr. Davis said, humans should start becoming comfortable with controlling the textures of ecosystems based on what works -- ecologically, aesthetically, or otherwise -- and what does not.
He noted that nest-robbing brown-headed cowbirds are native to North America, as are hantavirus and Lyme disease.
"Native versus exotic doesn't make ecological sense," he said. "It doesn't make practical sense, and it drives a lot of attention and energy away from really important problems we should be addressing." 
The most pressing question for many conservationists is what species or habitat to save.
Often, they rely on sheer numbers to make the tough decisions.
Following the simple rule that more is better, conservationists are giving highest priority to biodiversity hot spots -- those places that are rich in species and often lush and beautiful. The strategy was refined by Conservation International, an influential private group in Washington.
But now some scientists have begun to challenge even this once unassailable formula. "Biodiversity hot spots are just places with a lot of unique plant species," said Dr. Peter Kareiva, a lead scientist at the Nature Conservancy. He has been urging conservationists to look beyond simple species counts when deciding how to dispense limited resources.
"You have to be mindful of uniqueness," Dr. Kareiva said. "Look at biodiversity cold spots and you'll find they're pretty valuable to people, like the Serengeti or all of Alaska."
After important habitat is identified, another problem confronts battle-weary scientists and officials seeking to hold back bulldozers, chain saws and fishing nets. 
Instead of just establishing parks, building fences and hiring guards, some conservationists are moving to something akin to conservation judo, they say, using the power of their opponents to their own advantage.
Last year, for example, surveys by the World Conservation Union and Future Harvest, a group promoting traditional agriculture, found that half the world's 17,000 major wildlife refuges were being heavily used for agriculture. In fact, the survey found, some reserves actually attract impoverished settlers seeking land.
These findings have convinced some conservation biologists that they should work with farmers to preserve some habitat and find ways to prevent wildlife from consuming crops. 
"To avert widespread extinctions and feed the world, we must integrate biodiversity preservation into all landscapes -- from grazing lands to coffee plantations to rice paddies," said Jeffrey A. McNeely, the chief scientist at the World Conservation Union.
This integration can be as simple as establishing windbreaks of trees between dairy pastures, as has been done in Costa Rica. The rows of trees serve as corridors for the passage of wildlife.
In the seas, similar efforts are under way. Fishermen in St. Lucia in the Caribbean initially opposed the establishment of protected marine reserves along some coasts but now support the project because catches in adjacent fishable waters have risen 30 percent or more.
Meanwhile, though, scientists seeking to preserve wild things on an increasingly modified earth struggle to define their goals, when native wildlife increasingly mixes with introduced, farmed or hybridized varieties.
Many of the Florida panthers that prowl in state refuges are no longer pure but instead a result of crossbreeding with Western mountain lions.
Ranching groups in the West have petitioned the Fish and Wildlife Service to remove gray wolves from the federal list of endangered species because many may actually be mixed breeds of wolves and coyotes. The red wolf in the Southwest has come under similar scrutiny.
In the Pacific Northwest, fights have sprung up around salmon species that are protected by states and the federal government, while those same species are being bred in fish hatcheries.
The protections come with real costs, with farmers denied water and loggers denied access to forests. The new debate has repeatedly landed wildlife scientists in court, defending or attacking decisions about what is rare, what is special, what should be saved.
Which leads to yet another question: who decides what is special? If left to a majority, weaned on the Discovery Channel and National Geographic, the wild world of the future may end up looking cuddly and cute -- still populated with pandas and other so-called charismatic megafauna -- but may not have much biological integrity deep down. Ecologists say that ecosystems are often built on the backs of creatures that can only be called uncharismatic microfauna.
In many ways, some conservation biologists say, this spate of new challenges is just the next step in the maturing of this still relatively young field. In what some are referring to as the conceptual adolescence of conservation, researchers are beginning to get away from simplistic notions of a return to an untampered wilderness and instead starting the harder journey toward a future of human choices, intervention and management.
"Conservation biologists are too romantic," Dr. Kareiva said. "They think what's good is what's natural. Let's be serious. A better vision is something that functions and has habitat quality and aesthetic quality. We have to ask, What do we want the natural world to look like 100 years from now?"

HEADLINE: Planned Mini-Series on Hitler's Early Life Brings Criticism 

BYLINE:  By BERNARD WEINRAUB 

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD, Aug. 18 

 BODY:
Can a four-hour CBS mini-series based on the early life of Hitler accurately depict his monstrousness?
 To CBS executives and the producers, Alliance Atlantis, a respected Canadian film and television company, the film is to be an accurate study of Hitler as a youth until his ascension to power in 1933. 
 To the project's critics -- most of whom have not read the script -- the very idea of a drama about Hitler's youth is appalling and bound unwittingly to create a sense of sympathy for one of history's great villains. "Why the need or the desire to make this monster human?" asked Abraham H. Foxman, the national director of the Anti-Defamation League. "The judgment of history is that he was evil, that he was responsible for millions of deaths. Why trivialize that judgment of history by focusing on his childhood and adolescence? Have we run out of subjects to focus on?" 
Executives at CBS and Alliance Atlantis disclosed the project recently, and filming is set to start in the next few months in Munich and Prague. An international search is under way for a young actor for the title role. The film is based on "Hitler, 1889-1936: Hubris," the first volume of Ian Kershaw's acclaimed biography, and is scheduled to be presented next year.
"I think there is some adverse reaction to it," Leslie Moonves, president and chief executive officer at CBS, told television critics and reporters last month. "I guess I'm a little surprised by it." Mr. Moonves said that the project was brought to CBS by Alliance Atlantis, and that the network was intrigued. "This is a very timely subject about how bad guys get into power and how it affects the rest of the world."
Nancy Tellem, president of CBS Entertainment, said: "I think everyone's so focused on Hitler and the involvement in World War II and the concentration camps. The focus of 'Hitler,' this mini-series, when he's 17 to 34, his rise to power, the society that allowed this to happen, how Hitler became Hitler. I think it's unbelievably compelling."
Critics of the project said that whatever its intentions, a movie dealing with a young Hitler is bound to create a certain sense of sympathy, especially among younger viewers for whom World War II seems like ancient history. Even in a film like "Silence of the Lambs," the Oscar-winning performance of Anthony Hopkins as a cannibalistic killer was so captivating that audiences were alternately revolted and charmed by him.
Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, said that by not dealing with the second part of Hitler's life -- and World War II and the Holocaust -- CBS and Alliance Atlantis were leaving television viewers without the full implications of Hitler's actions. 
"It's telling only half of a terrible story," Rabbi Hier said. "Teenagers may watch the young Hitler and say he just needed more guidance and attention, he wasn't that bad, if he only had a better home life. It creates a kind of sympathy and new attitude toward Hitler."
The script, by G. Ross Parker, has been closely held. But an early draft, dated May 31, offers a portrait of Hitler as an angry and sullen youth who adored his mother and loathed his father (who may have been half-Jewish). Hitler is presented as a struggling bohemian, artist and opportunist with a flare for public speaking.
The script makes clear that Hitler's early relationships with Jews, like a doctor who treated his mother, were friendly. But Germany's loss in World War I and the nation's economic collapse and political chaos, coupled with Hitler's obsessive nationalism, led him to rant publicly against Communists, Social Democrats and Jews.
The script points out that when young Hitler realized that his anti-Jewish remarks especially stirred strong applause among his German audiences, rich and poor, he accelerated his anti-Semitism.
The film concludes with Hitler in power -- after ordering the murder of several former associates -- watching the documentary film, "Triumph of the Will," the spellbinding propaganda movie that turned Hitler into a godlike figure. The creator of the film, Leni Riefenstahl (who will turn 100 on Thursday), shows him the movie. (Jodie Foster is scheduled to star in a film about Ms. Riefenstahl and help produce it, a project that also dismays Jewish groups.)
Alan Wagner, a CBS executive in the 1970's and 1980's, who was sent the script by a friend, termed the screenplay horrifying. In an e-mail to several reporters, Mr. Wagner said Hitler was merely presented as "idiosyncratic, odd," and there was little sense of the horrors that he would perpetrate. He said the end of the film resembled "Rocky," in which the underdog boxer triumphs. "The underdog has won," Mr. Wagner said.
In a phone interview Mr. Wagner, who is chairman of Boardwalk Entertainment in New York and was once vice president for programming at CBS, said that he was especially concerned that the film did not mention Auschwitz, Gestapo torture, or Hitler's decision to move toward a policy of annihilation of Jews and other groups.
But Peter Sussman, president of the Alliance Atlantis Entertainment Group, said: "It's hard for me to understand how anybody could ever see Hitler as being sympathetic. More important, the devil doesn't always come with horns or spewing fire. Evil isn't always easily recognizable. Sure there were people who believed in Hitler, and thought he was appealing. And that's the worst kind of evil."
Mr. Sussman said he pursued the project because the story of Hitler as a young man had never been done. 
"Almost every event that flowed from the behavior and the conduct of the Nazis has been covered extensively by film and TV," Mr. Sussman said. "I realized the seeds from which all this began -- how these horrible events happened -- has never been done." 
He acknowledged, "I didn't realize there would be such a loud concern over a possible negative impact."

HEADLINE: MANAGING PLANET EARTH; 
Forget Nature. Even Eden Is Engineered.

BYLINE:  By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
Nearly 70 years ago, a Soviet geochemist, reflecting on his world, made a startling observation: through technology and sheer numbers, he wrote, people were becoming a geological force, shaping the planet's future just as rivers and earthquakes had shaped its past.
 Eventually, wrote the scientist, Vladimir I. Vernadsky, global society, guided by science, would soften the human environmental impact, and earth would become a "noosphere," a planet of the mind, "life's domain ruled by reason." 
 Today, a broad range of scientists say, part of Vernadsky's thinking has already been proved right: people have significantly altered the atmosphere and are the dominant influence on ecosystems and natural selection. The question now, scientists say, is whether the rest of his vision will come to pass. Choices made in the next few years will determine the answer. 
Aided by satellites and supercomputers, and mobilized by the evident environmental damage of the last century, humans have a real chance to begin balancing economic development with sustaining earth's ecological webs, said Dr. William C. Clark, a biologist at Harvard who heads an international effort to build a scientific foundation for such a shift. 
"We've come through a period of finally understanding the nature and magnitude of humanity's transformation of the earth," Dr. Clark said. "Having realized it, can we become clever enough at a big enough scale to be able to maintain the rates of progress? I think we can."
Some scientists say it is anthropocentric hubris to think people understand the living planet well enough to know how to manage it. But that prospect is attracting more than 100 world leaders and thousands of other participants to the United Nations' World Summit on Sustainable Development, which starts on Monday in Johannesburg. 
No matter what they come up with, ice ages, volcanoes and shifting tectonic plates will dwarf human activities in the long run. But communities and countries face concrete choices in the next decade that are likely to determine the quality of human life and the environment well into the 22nd century.
Human activity is such a pervasive influence on the planet's ecological framework that it is no longer possible to separate people and nature.
Emissions of heat-trapping carbon dioxide, whether from an Ohio power plant or a Bangkok taxicab, contribute to global warming. 
Seafood lovers dining in Manhattan bistros prompt fishing vessels to sweep Antarctic waters for slow-growing Chilean sea bass. Shoppers in Tokyo seeking inexpensive picture frames send loggers deep into Indonesian forests.
In a new book "Great Transition: The Promise and Lure of the Times Ahead," published by the Stockholm Environment Institute, a group of top geographers, economists, engineers and other experts concludes that the same inventiveness that accelerated the human ascent can be harnessed to soften human impact.
The need for a new approach is urgent, the researchers say, because a surge of growth in quickly industrializing regions of Asia and the Americas could have environmental effects that exceed those of the industrialization of the West. More pressure for change comes from southern Africa and other pockets of extreme poverty where the brutal calculus of Malthus still holds sway.
Even in the industrialized north, after generations of prosperity, people are hemmed in by concrete, seeing commuting times grow and starting to question their definition of progress.
As a result, countless communities, from the charred fringes of the Amazon to the spreading suburbs of Seattle, are balancing growing needs and limited resources.
If development does not change course, the new book concludes, "the nightmare of an impoverished, mean, destructive future looms."

Signs of Improvement
Unexpected Cleanups Generate Optimism
Over the past 30 years, "sustainability" has become the mantra of many private groups, government officials, scientists and, even, a growing number of businesses. Most define the notion as advancing human endeavors without diminishing prospects for future generations. The Johannesburg summit will be the third global conclave in that span chasing this elusive goal. 
But movement toward concrete action has been slow. The first meeting, in Stockholm in 1972, rang an alarm about despoiling the earth. Wealthy nations began cleaning air and water, but continued to assault forests and other resources elsewhere to fuel growth. 
In 1992 came the second meeting, in Rio de Janeiro, called the Earth Summit. There, diplomats forged ambitious agreements aimed at holding back deserts and protecting the atmosphere, forests and pockets of biological richness.
But the agreements were vague, relying more on good will than on concrete obligations. Developing countries refused to take on obligations, saying the north should step first.
After Rio, population continued to grow, poverty persisted, forests retreated, soils eroded, fish stocks shrank, and concentrations of heat-trapping greenhouse gases rose, despite a treaty in which industrialized countries pledged to "strive" to reduce them.
Now, a host of satellites provides streams of data that powerful computers sift and disseminate on the Web. Communities can track forest loss in Indonesia, sprawl in Indiana and the flow of pollution from state to state, country to country.
After disasters like the chemical release in Bhopal, India, in 1984 and the grounding of the Exxon Valdez in Alaska in 1989, many companies have shifted practices to avoid environmental damage, shareholder wrath and consumer boycotts.
Fast-growing developing countries including China and Mexico are rapidly cutting urban air pollution.. 
They have been spurred both by commmunity pressure and awareness of the high costs of treating illnesses cause by pollution.
Indonesia, China and other countries are posting factories' chemical emissions on the Web. The technique, pioneered in the United States, is prompting cleanups.
No one expects that people will be able to manage the planet like some giant corporation -- the real Big Blue.
"If you mean making the thousands of little decisions that need to be made, we can no more effectively manage the world than the Soviet Union could manage its centrally planned economy," said Dr. Robert W. Kates, a geographer who headed a National Academy of Sciences committee on sustainable development and is an author of "Great Transition."
But Dr. Kates says the potential exists to make informed choices that spread the benefits of development to an impoverished majority while not depleting vital assets.
One impediment to such a transition is the change itself, the environmental and societal turbulence created by explosive human growth, technological advance and the planetwide linkup of disparate cultures, Dr. Kates and other experts say.
Another barrier, they add, is the enormous growth of population and consumption. Although global population appears headed for a 50 percent increase in the next 50 years, for example, demand for food will likely double, as prosperity raises the per capita consumption of calories.
There is another roadblock. Not every problem of consequence comes with a Bhopal-style wake-up call. Global warming and species extinction are examples of potential catastrophes that are hiding in plain sight, experts say.
Scientists are helping identify problems and opportunities. But communities will make choices guided only in part by what makes sense for the long haul.
For one thing, big gaps persist in the basic information needed to measure progress. When a team from Yale and Columbia studied dozens of trends in 142 countries to rank their sustainability, the members had to leave 40 percent of their spreadsheet blank, said Daniel C. Esty, a Yale law professor, who was a leader of the project.
Nonetheless, optimists say they see signs of hope. Not the least of them is the intensifying dialogue on the problem, which includes parties as disparate as multinational companies and tribal bands.
In essence, the human capacity for understanding the world is catching up with the human capacity to change it, Dr. Clark at Harvard said. "It really is a plausible case that we're coming on a key stage now, with the cold war under control, with globalization happening," he said.
The hard part, he said, will be for societies to overcome a habit of focusing on present needs. "Do we move beyond simply being a big bull in a china shop, having impacts, to becoming a reflective capacity on the planet?" Dr. Clark asked. "Or do we simply bungle ahead?"

An Altered World
Human Imprints From Pole to Pole
Evidence abounds now that the world is a human-dominated place.
By flooding the atmosphere with synthetic chemicals and heat-trapping carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, for example, people damaged the protective ozone layer and contributed to a warming climate, scientists have said. The ozone depletion became vividly and unexpectedly evident in the 1980's, when a gaping hole was detected over Antarctica. 
The hole will shrink in the next 50 years because of a ban on ozone-eating chlorofluorocarbons. Other damage will not be so easy to repair.
Long before they are cataloged, thousands of plant and animal species are likely to be driven to extinction as forests, wetlands, mountain slopes and other habitats are exploited or harmed by climate change.
Satellites that map vegetation and the nighttime signature of human activity -- fire and light -- show that people have altered more than one-third of the terrestrial landscape. Once it is changed, it is usually changed forever, Dr. G. David Tilman, an ecologist at the University of Minnesota, said. "When you add another 1,000 acres of shopping mall or another highway, far into the future those are probably close to permanent acts," Dr. Tilman said.
Where progress is seen, too often it is only in a slowing rate of destruction, ecologists say. For example, new satellite surveys show that forest loss in the tropics through the 1990's occurred at a rate 23 percent less than previous estimates. But losses still add up to some 14 million acres a year, with 5 million more acres visibly damaged.
The human imprint is evident almost everywhere. In the South Atlantic, fleets illuminate so much of the ocean to attract squid that the illuminated area dwarfs the megalopolis of Sao Paulo. The squid harvest has in part grown because commercial fish stocks have been overfished. 
Altogether, scientists have found that two-thirds of commercial marine fish species are fully exploited or diminishing, prompting companies to move down the food chain.
Aquaculture is a fast-growing alternative, but often causes damage like the destruction of coastal mangroves in southern Asia to make way for shrimp farms.
 Also, in many cases, farmed species are fed fish meal made of other fish. So the cultivation still indirectly depletes the oceans.
Hydrologists estimate that people appropriate half the world's flowing fresh water. Across the American West in the last 20 years, circular patches made by great rotating irrigation rigs have peppered the land like an expanding checkerboard, marking the draining of aquifers under the plains.
Scientists have concluded that humans not only now dominate the planet, but have also become the dominant driver of natural selection, the machinery of evolution.
The main influence, experts say, is the continuing chemical arms race against germs and pests, which kills most, but leaves a resistant minority behind. 
Also, by wittingly and unwittingly moving myriad species around the globe, humans have become a biological blender, carrying West Nile virus to America and overrunning the Bordeaux countryside in France with American bullfrogs that residents say do not even taste good. 

Troubling Trends
An S.U.V. Culture Shifts to Third World
Projections for the next two generations do not bode well for easing environmental problems. Even with the population bomb predicted in the 1960's substantially defused, the human population is likely headed for at least nine billion before leveling off. 
Most of the growth will be in poor countries, and as people there pursue prosperity, consumption of natural resources will rapidly increase.
Half the world's 17,000 major wildlife refuges are already being heavily used for agriculture, recent studies showed.
Car companies are racing to build factories to assemble sport utility vehicles in India, even as its once-legendary rail system, plagued by mismanagement, is deteriorating and losing freight and passengers, said Dr. Rajendra K. Pachauri, director general of the Tata Energy Research Institute of India. The private organization assesses energy and environmental problems in India.
"In the last 10 years, every major manufacturer has set up facilities in India," Dr. Pachauri said. "They see it as a major market. They have the buzz of the people. This is something that should cause real concern."
Depending on how power is generated, bringing electricity to the two billion people in the world who still lack it could greatly increase emissions of greenhouse gases. But, experts note, the options available to those who remain off the grid also cause harm. The two billion people who cook on wood or dung fires live in acrid clouds of toxic smoke and deplete forests. 
In India, Dr. Pachauri said, millions of people light their homes with kerosene, using government-subsidized fuel. Together, cooking fires and sputtering lanterns create indoor pollution that causes asthma and other ailments and that, in India alone, is estimated to kill 600,000 women a year.
Dr. Pachauri's group has experimented with distributing solar-powered lanterns to rural communities. Other projects push cleaner ovens that use less-polluting fuels.
But the question of how to take good ideas from pilot projects to the new norm remains largely unsolved. 
Then there are the costs. For example, about a billion people have no clean water. More than twice that number live where raw sewage flows unchecked. So water is a prime focus of the delegates in Johannesburg. 
When even countries like the United States lag tens of billions of dollars in improving their sewage systems, experts say the prospects of big investments elsewhere are dim.

New Strategies
Learning to Harvest More From Less
The hardest part of meshing economic and environmental progress, experts say, is that this shift cannot be engineered with top-down directives.
It will be a result of 10,000 decisions, large and small, by countries, communities, companies and individuals, said Dr. Kates, the geographer.
Action will have to be focused where the human imprint is most intense, in forests, on the farm and in the fast-expanding cities, experts say. 
An analysis by the World Wildlife Fund found that 20 percent of the existing forest area could provide all the world's future needs for wood and pulp if it was all managed according to environmentally sound practices that a few big companies have already adopted.
Some forestry companies and wood and paper buyers, including Home Depot and Ikea, participate in a program in which wood is certified by the Forest Stewardship Council, a private group. The council monitors forest holdings and products to ensure that wood marketed as environmentally friendly is produced with limited damage.
Other organizations run similar certification programs to encourage growers of other crops like bananas and cocoa to preserve habitat or limit pesticide use.
Those efforts remain a tiny fringe of the markets for those commodities. The Forest Stewardship Council has certified 70 million acres of forests -- just 4 percent of the total acreage controlled by timber companies.
If farming does not change drastically in the next few decades, enormous ecological damage will result, many scientists say.
Dr. Tilman of Minnesota notes that farming has already produced the biggest global imprint of humanity, affecting half the earth's habitable land. The challenge now, he said, will be to double agricultural productivity without using substantially more land. 
There are signs this can be achieved. In an extraordinary experiment several years ago, in Yunnan Province, China, rice farmers were recruited to intersperse two varieties on 8,000 acres instead of planting one. The yield nearly doubled, and the occurrence of rice blast, the most harmful disease in the world's biggest crop, fell 94 percent.
Recognizing a good thing, China has expanded the work to 250,000 acres, said Dr. Christopher C. Mundt, a plant pathologist at Oregon State University who helped conduct the research.
"Perhaps more important," he added, "the Chinese are taking the general concept of diversification into related approaches" to other crops.
The key to the next green revolution, Dr. Mundt said, will be abandoning most of the industrial model of agriculture of the 20th century and shifting to a "biological model based on management of ecological processes" like applying fertilizer and water only as needed.
Such efforts are being made in agriculture, forestry, fisheries and other fields around the world. But, once again, experts say the challenge lies in moving to the scales needed to avert widespread harm.

The Role of the City
The Megalopolis As Eco-Strategy
Another focal point for experts who envision a managed earth is cities. In many ways, they are where the battle will be won or lost.
Cities are where almost all remaining population growth will occur, demographers say. The roster of megacities, those with populations exceeding 10 million, is widely expected to climb, from 20 today to 36 by 2015.
These vast metropolises have been widely characterized as a nightmarish element of the new century, sprawling and chaotic and spawning waste and illness.
But increasingly, demographers and other experts say that cities may actually be a critical means of limiting environmental damage. Most significantly, they say, family size drops sharply in urban areas. 
"The city is perhaps the most effective device for reducing the birthrate," said Dr. George Bugliarello, chancellor of the Polytechnic University in Brooklyn and an expert on urban trends.
For the poor, access to health care, schools and other basic services is generally greater in the city than in the countryside. Energy is used more efficiently, and drinking and wastewater systems, although lacking now, can be built relatively easily.
And for every person who moves to a city, that is one person fewer chopping firewood or poaching game.
Still, many cities face decisions now that may permanently alter the quality of human lives and the environment.
Dr. Kates said the pivotal nature of these times is perfectly illustrated by Mexico City, which is just behind Tokyo atop the list of megacities. The sprawling megalopolis, where traffic is paralyzed, is about to choose in a referendum between double-decking its downtown highways or expanding its subway system.
One course could encourage sprawl and pollution; the other would conserve energy, experts say.

Chances of Change
'Pernicious Fad'Or Real Prospect?
Some environmentalists say the whole notion of sustainable development is an oxymoron, that the Western industrial model of endless growth, however packaged, cannot possibly persist without grievous environmental damage. At the same time, some business leaders still scoff at the effort.
In a new PricewaterhouseCoopers survey of Fortune 1000 executives' attitudes toward sustainable development, one corporate vice president for environmental affairs called the concept "a pernicious fad."
Some skeptics note that even if cleaner, less destructive industries take hold everywhere, the sheer volume of economic growth could still cause big problems.
But a durable line of pragmatic optimists from science, business and environmental groups, for now, holds center stage. 
They say that cleaning the environment and reducing poverty are not only required from an ethical standpoint, but also because they are in humanity's self-interest. 
Without improvements, said Nitin Desai, the United Nations official running the Johannesburg meeting, "you create societies that live in a state of perpetual hopelessness." 
"That is obviously going to hit back at you at some stage," Mr. Desai said.
Hundreds of businesses, though still a minority, have added sustainability managers to their executive roster.
Prof. Jeffrey D. Sachs, director of the Columbia University Earth Institute, said the world was quickly shifting from a model in which wealth was derived mainly through exploiting resources.
"Most growth now comes from increased knowledge, not from the mining of nature," Professor Sachs said. "And knowledge isn't limited in the way that, say, soil fertility is."
Dr. Kates agrees that economic advancement is vital and says evidence is emerging in many places that it can occur without too much environmental harm. Despite federal inaction on climate change, Dr. Kates said, 129 American cities have programs to cut greenhouse-gas emissions, and California has moved to reduce car emissions. 
"This fits with history," he said. "States and cities have always been a major set of social experimenters. This was true on disability insurance and child-labor laws, on antimonopoly laws." 
It may well end up being the case that local communities, here and abroad, lead the way in harmonizing people and the planet, he said.
"That ferment," Dr. Kates said, "is the most encouraging sign."

CORRECTION-DATE: August 26, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article in Science Times on Tuesday about the impact of humans on global ecosystems misstated the results of an experiment in which farmers in China planted a mixture of two kinds of rice rather than one. (The same error appeared in the section on Aug. 22, 2000, but went unnoticed.) The yield rose 17 percent, nearly doubling for one variety and staying flat for the other; yield did not nearly double for both.

GRAPHIC: Photos: (Greg Whitteman); (Associated Press); (Andrew C. Revkin/The New York Times); (Dr. Janet Earle); (Gibson USA); (Media Hotline)(pg. F1) Chart: "The World Remade By Human Hands"When delegates convene in Johannesburg next week for a United Nations environment summit, they will confront the problems human interference has brought to the world's ecosystems. But some trends once seen as problems may not be so bad after all. And some seemingly beneficial trends have serious unexpected side effects. Here are some examples. MEGACITIESBy 2015, demographers predict, the number of cities with more than 10 million people -- so-called megacities -- will rise to 36, from about 20 today. Megacities are notorious for pollution and sprawling slums. But people who live in them tend to have smaller families and greater opportunities for jobs and educations. And environmental improvements can come quickly to cities. For example, in Mexico City, left, the percentage of days violating pollution standards has fallen to less than 20 percent, from 50 percent. Now the city is considering a mass transit program that would bring further improvements. FOOD SUPPLIESDemographers are lowering their estimates for how much the population of the world will increase before it stabilizes, but even so they predict 50 percent growth by the end of the century. Demand for food will grow even faster, as people in developing countries start consuming more meat and fish. Aquaculture, once thought of as a solution, has produced problems of its own. In Thailand, left, and elsewhere, shrimp farms have replaced valuable mangrove ecosystems. In China, however, a recent experiment in mixing rice varieties in a single field (below) greatly increased yields, without added chemicals. FALLING FORESTSIn the tropics, forests continue to fall before farmers, loggers and timber processors like the saw mill, left, on a branch of the Amazon River in Brazil. But new surveys show that in the 1990's the rate of cutting was 23 percent less than earlier estimates. Some timber companies have gained certification from environmental groups as managing forests with care. Companies that buy their wood, like the Gibson guitar company, promote their products as environmentally friendly. Environmental groups are working with growers of cocoa, bananas, coffee and other commodities to adopt similar programs. And some conservationists now say that judicious logging can actually benefit the plants and animals that live in the forest. (pg.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TRAVEL: ON THE GROUND -- In Singapore; 
Learning to Have Fun While Getting Things Done

BYLINE:  By WAYNE ARNOLD; This feature about places to stay, eat and visit in leading business destinations appears every Tuesday.

 BODY:
Travelers know Singapore as the place in Southeast Asia to get things done, not to have fun. Yet as Singapore emerges from its worst recession since independence in 1965, there's something more than tropical humidity in the air. This port city is trying to recast itself as a lifestyle capital. 
 Returning visitors may be surprised to see a resplendent new waterfront buzzing with cafes and bars, connected by river taxis. Dominating it all is the bulbous Esplanade performance center, which is scheduled to open in early October. 
 The government has put nearly everything else up for an overhaul, too, from censorship rules to foreign investment restrictions. In May, it lowered income taxes and created new incentives for highly educated foreigners to move here. High-technology remains in vogue, but Singapore is turning to chemicals and pharmaceuticals to offset its dependence on electronics. Pack extra business cards for boardroom formalities, but unless you intend to hold a news conference, leave your suit jackets at home.

HOTELS
The CONRAD INTERNATIONAL HOTEL (65-6334-8888, $139 for a single room; phone numbers must be preceded by 011 if dialed from the United States) earns top marks thanks to its location across the street from the Singapore International Convention and Exhibition Center. With excellent restaurants and a popular breakfast buffet, the Conrad is also a short walk from two malls full of cheap places to eat. Singapore's elusive taxis are easier to find here. And like all hotels recommended here, the Conrad's rooms offer high-speed Internet access.
Nearby is the RITZ-CARLTON MILLENIA (65-6337-8888, $167), where executives like the quiet lobby bar. Sea views complement the Ritz's butler-drawn aroma therapy baths. Rooms facing the city skyline are popular.
The FULLERTON SINGAPORE (65-6733-8388, $170), a sleek, modern luxury hotel hiding inside a converted colonial post office is smack in the heart of the financial district, with a 25-meter pool and fantastic views of the booming bars along the Singapore River. The Fullerton is one of Singapore's most popular Sunday brunch spots. 
You can drive across Singapore in 30 minutes, so staying outside the center is no major handicap. If you want to lower your expenses, consider the BEAUFORT SINGAPORE (65-6275-0331, $145), which sits next to an 18-hole golf course. The concierge can book a round for you on weekdays for $71.

DINING OUT
When Richard Branson, the chairman of Virgin Group, comes to town, his Asia manager, Andrew C. Craissati, takes him to the boisterous Chinese restaurants at the UDMC Seafood Center. One is LONG BEACH (65-6448-3636, $44 for two, including beer or wine and tip). This is the perfect place to try pepper crab. Many shy from such a messy meal, but to others it's the perfect icebreaker. 
At the opposite end of the spectrum is the SUMMER PAVILION (65-6434-5286, $78) at the Ritz-Carlton. Impressive to anyone at ease with Asian cuisine, the Summer Pavilion's refined presentations may intimidate less experienced Westerners.
Situated in a converted convent, LEI GARDEN (65-6339-3822, $125) serves Cantonese food in a lively, family-style setting. Sam Lin, deputy chairman of the systems integrator North 22 Technology Services Group, says Lei Garden is ideal for big groups. Its round tables mean no one is stuck at one end.
For a slightly less casual lunch atmosphere, try a taste of Thailand at THANYING (65-6222-4688, $25) Another favored lunch spot is RISTORANTE DA PAOLO (65-6224-7081, $30) which is just a few minutes walk from the financial district. 
Brian Kornegay, regional sales manager at IDC Asia/Pacific, takes clients to MORTON'S OF CHICAGO (65-6339-3740, $258) for the generous beef portions. Morton's also has private dining rooms that seat up to 40.
LES AMIS (65-6733-2225, $400), tucked away on a side street in the shopping district, has what is undoubtedly the most extensive wine list in Singapore, from a $33 bottle of 2000 Chateau du Rouet to a 1947 Chateau Petrus for $6,300.
For a taste of haute cuisine without a haughty attitude, try SAINT PIERRE (65-6438-0887, $150). A relative newcomer, Saint Pierre earns raves for its four types of foie gras.

ENTERTAINMENT
For a quiet drink in an atmosphere that evokes the Raj, try the BAR AND BILLIARD ROOM at Raffles Hotel (65-6337-1886). In addition to two century-old billiards tables, the Bar and Billiard Room has an excellent collection of Cuban cigars, single-malt whiskey and wine by the glass.
A livelier scene can be found at MUDDY MURPHY'S (65-6735-0400), a prefabricated Irish pub built in Dublin and reassembled along Orchard Road.

ON YOUR OWN
Ngee Ann City on Orchard Road has more than 130 shops under one roof.
Singapore's Night Safari (65-6269-3411) is open from 7 p.m. to midnight and offers close-up views of nocturnal wildlife from bats to leopards in a realistic, tropical-jungle setting.

HEADLINE: An Ethics Lesson for Business Schools 

BYLINE:  By Robert Prentice; Robert Prentice teaches business law at the McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas at Austin.

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex. 

 BODY:
When Joseph Wharton established the nation's first business school at the University of Pennsylvania in 1881, he made business law one of five basic business school disciplines. More than a century later, the study of business law has given way to the study of business ethics.
 But business students do not need to study business ethics so much as they need to study business law. The scandals at Enron, WorldCom and ImClone did not occur because executives were not conversant with the difference between teleological and deontological approaches to resolving ethical questions. It goes without saying that these scandals involved serious ethical lapses. But they also involved serious violations of business laws. They occurred, at least in part, because their participants had an insufficient knowledge of, appreciation for and, yes, fear of the law. Business schools have played a role in this disaster. 
 Because today businesses face far more complicated rules and regulations than they did a century ago, the need for managers to have a realistic appreciation of the legal environment in which they operate is more important than ever. Some business schools still have strong business law programs, but most have spent much of the last three decades reducing, marginalizing and often eliminating their business law faculty as other disciplines grew in stature and popularity.
Consequently, in many business schools most students get their only look at the legal environment in which they will operate from faculty who view the law as an impediment. Finance professors have told me that insider trading rules and financial disclosure requirements simply undermine the efficiency of the markets. Accounting professors have explained to me that rules limiting the ability of accounting firms to provide internal auditing services to a client (and thereby prepare the same books that they later purport to audit independently) are pointless, because accountants would never risk their reputation by acting improperly. (Many accounting professors still believe this, but they are quieter in the aftermath of Enron.) No wonder many business professors impart to their students an impression that the law exists simply to be manipulated or evaded.
At several leading business schools, many of the faculty that teach business law no longer even have law degrees; economists and political scientists offer policy courses that focus on lobbying. Indeed, much finance and economics research and teaching is built on the silly (though occasionally useful) assumption that man is a rational maximizer of his own utilities -- and that these utilities can be measured financially. Not only is this unrealistic but, as the law professor Charles Pouncy has noted, it also encourages the view that any business strategy or activity that does not maximize monetary reward is suspect. This is the message that business schools tend to send -- and companies like Enron tend to follow.
With the help of well-intentioned donors, several business schools have established business ethics centers. Unfortunately, research shows that it is very difficult to teach ethical values to undergraduates, harder still to teach them to M.B.A. students and all but impossible to get through to those enrolled in executive M.B.A. courses. If they didn't get a sense of right and wrong from their families or their faith, it's unlikely a business school professor can instill one.
Ethics courses can help those who are truly well-intentioned find their way through ethical dilemmas where the law gives no clear answer. But even these people will founder when they go to work for companies that value results over honesty; at such firms, acting ethically is always difficult.
There has never been a more crucial time to emphasize law in a business curriculum. Too many people forget that capitalism was saved from its own excesses by the securities laws passed in the 1930's. Recent scholarship shows that countries with strong judicial systems administering rigorous financial laws enable companies to raise money more quickly and facilitate more efficient stock markets. Legitimate companies want laws that require accurate financial disclosure and rules that punish fraudulent firms.
Centers for the study of business ethics are necessary to represent the ideals to which we aspire. But most business students will always view business ethics as hortatory rather than mandatory, as extra credit rather than required.
Instead, business law professors should explain to students that legal requirements are not optional. Such requirements enable our free-enterprise system to function -- and disobedience carries a personal as well as a societal cost. My colleagues and I must tell this story more forcefully than we have in the past. But to do so we need a more prominent forum in the business schools of America.

HEADLINE: Modest Decline in Indicators Suggests Recovery Sputters On 

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
An important gauge of economic activity fell in July, amid stock market gyrations, sagging consumer expectations and disclosures of corporate dishonesty, but the drop was not as bad as expected. 
 The Conference Board reported yesterday that the index of leading economic indicators dropped 0.4 percent in July, to 111.7, after falling by a revised 0.2 percent in June. Analysts had expected a drop of 0.5 percent. 
 The analysts said the decline confirmed that the economy was still in a recovery, if a shaky one, and they were encouraged that consumers continued to buy big-ticket items like cars and homes. "The economy has run into a soft patch," said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist of Wells Fargo & Company, "and we are trying to get out of the rut." 
The index measures where the overall United States economy is headed in the next three to six months, using a 1996 base figure of 100. July's decline was the third time in the last four months that the index failed to increase. 
Stock prices contributed to last month's decline, the report said. "Volatile financial markets, corporate scandals and sagging consumer expectations are trouble spots," the board's chief economist, Ken Goldstein, said. "But latest evidence shows no significant weakening in the consumer markets, with home and car buying continuing to be strong." 
While consumers bought high-priced goods, they cut back on discretionary items, like travel and dining out, Mr. Sohn said. But there are signs that some discretionary spending might be increasing. 
"The stock market is improving, and consumers are hitting the malls again," he said. "Hopefully, even businesses would feel better about future sales prospects to start spending money on capital equipment." 
Mark Vitner, senior economist with Wachovia Securities, cited strong car sales, which he said were significant because people who are "worried about their jobs don't go out and buy new cars." 
"We would look for the numbers to come back in a couple of months," Mr. Vitner said, "and that should help the leading index bounce back in the fall." 
The Conference Board's coincident index, which measures current economic activity, rose 0.1 percent in July, to 115.0. The index of lagging indicators, which reflects changes that have already occurred, rose 0.1 percent, to 100.7.

 BODY:
More Companies Use Online Booking
The use of in-house company Web sites to book business travel is growing rapidly, according to a survey to be released this week. 
 Online booking was in use during the second quarter of 2002 by about 42 percent of companies surveyed, up from about 24 percent in the period last year, according to GetThere, the Sabre subsidiary that is a leading supplier of customized corporate booking technology. 
 Companies in the survey spent from $10 million to $300 million on business travel last year, with an average of $55 million, GetThere said. They reported an average saving on air fares of about 15 percent through employee online booking, rather than use of a company or a third-party travel agent. 
Larger companies tend to save most because "they have more leverage with airlines" in negotiating volume discounts, said a GetThere spokesman. Also, big companies tend to have higher online booking adoption rates because "they have more leverage with their employees," he added. That means big companies are more inclined, and better able, to require compliance with travel policies.

Airline Traffic Remains Stalled
"Traffic recovery in the airline industry has stalled," said David Swierenga, the chief economist of the Air Transport Association, the airline industry's trade group.
He was referring to the recently released statistics for the industry's benchmark: revenue passenger miles, which were down 8.4 percent last month compared with July 2001.
The domestic load factor -- the percent of seats filled by paying customers -- was 76.3 percent, meanwhile. That is a narrow increase over last July. But the number does not hold up so well when you consider that airlines flew 7.2 percent fewer seats this July. 
While domestic air travel remains in the doldrums, the picture is brightening overseas, according to OAG, the international airline and air-schedule guide. According to OAG, scheduled flights worldwide in August are down only 4 percent.
Trans-Atlantic routes are showing steep declines, though. Flights from Kennedy International in New York to Western Europe are down 15 percent; from Los Angeles, they are down 21 percent, OAG said.

JetBlue Airways Shuns Philadelphia
"On the whole, I'd rather be in Philadelphia," W. C. Fields once said when asked what epitaph he wanted on his tombstone. 
Not so for JetBlue Airways, evidently. Is upstart JetBlue looking to expand into Philadelphia, where US Airways, which filed for bankruptcy protection last week, now controls most of the gates and about 75 percent of the departures? Gareth Edmondson-Jones, a JetBlue spokesman, said probably not. 
Big carriers who control large numbers of gates sometimes block low-fare competitors from major airports, but even if some US Air gates open up at Philadelphia International Airport, JetBlue is not immediately interested. "At heart, we're plane-constrained," Mr. Edmondson-Jones said. "We get about 15 new aircraft a year. We want to grow slowly and properly."
Philadelphia just isn't that compelling, evidently. "After only 30 months of operation, we're still cherry-picking" expansion areas, he said.

HEADLINE: Fall Hits the Stores, and So Do the Shoppers 

BYLINE:  By CATHY HORYN 

 BODY:
Helen Schifter, the Upper East Side socialite, is trying to snag some Juicy Couture. "You know," she said helpfully, "those cashmere sweats and jackets that cost $200? Adorable. I've already been to Scoop, Bergdorf Goodman and Barneys, and I can't find them anywere." What Ms. Schifter has found, so far, are two Prada satin skirts, a pair of $495 custom Michael Kors jeans and a rainbow-bright Louis Vuitton sweater evocative of Ali MacGraw in "Love Story." The matching long scarf is extra. "Unfortunately," she said.
 In a month when most New Yorkers are looking to escape the heat, Ms. Schifter likes to slip into town from her beach house to peruse stores -- "because they're less crowded." Tomorrow, she plans to check out Alexander McQueen's new store on 14th Street. "Just to see," she said, "if there's more than that darn dress." She could only have meant the $1,500 milkmaid dress that Sarah Jessica Parker wears on the cover of the September Elle, which, in retailspeak, has been "blowing out" of stores. 
 Whether because of pent-up consumer demand, more tightly focused choices that help clarify decisions or that old desire to have the latest thing, women appear to be migrating back to stores with renewed interest. Traditionally, fall is when stores and magazines make their biggest impressions, if not their biggest numbers. It's when women think about starting over, sartorially at least. "You don't have to reinvent yourself," said Susan York, a 42-year-old homemaker in Manhattan, who has her eye on the ladylike clothes of Marc Jacobs's Louis Vuitton collection. "But there is something great about the fall season. You don't have to reinvent yourself, but you can."
Yet, in other ways, this fall will be crucial for retailers. Clothing sales are down 5 percent for the year, and no one is sure if the combined psychological effects of Sept. 11 and the shaky economy will dull spending. David Wolfe, an analyst at the Doneger Group, a retail consulting concern in New York, pointed up a conundrum. People are spending less, he said, but they are buying expensive items for the sheer pleasure of it.
"There's a lot of irresistible novelty out there, and that's what is selling," Mr. Wolfe said. "Basics are not what's selling. Nobody is spending discretionary income to replace things they already have." He added: "I'm really bullish about the fall merchandise. People have been complaining for some time that there's no excitement in stores, but I think the problem is about to solve itself. Fashion is selling."
In interviews with retailers and on a dozen excursions into stores, it was not hard to find supporting evidence. On the fifth floor of Bergdorf's on Friday, young women were inspecting military-style jackets and knitted mufflers from Marc by Marc Jacobs, while others were going for Theory low-rise trousers. On the second floor, Yves Saint Laurent velvet jackets and Chanel tweed minis were getting attention. Ditto hand-knit sweaters by John Galliano and embellished boots from Dolce & Gabbana.
"There's a huge desire to have one-of-a-kind pieces," said Robert Burke, the fashion director of Bergdorf's, noting that customers seem to be looking for feminine clothes with an outre touch of glamour.
That's something the magazines are also promoting, though, for once, retailers present a more intelligible view. The September Vogue -- four pounds, 750 pages, Kate Hudson on the cover -- offers a batty survey called "Glamour, Defined," in which it asks 11 writers to explain, "What is this thing called glamour?" Well, blimey, at the end you're still not sure. Much sharper is a Steven Klein photomontage that shows how sport meets chic in fur-edged jumpsuits and slick Balenciaga bomber jackets.
In Harper's Bazaar, the photographers Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin (with the stylist Melanie Ward) zero in on big knits -- and betray fashion's continued dependency on vintage clothes. Elle, with less guile, lays out the season's main points. "Here we have smashing new coats. . . ."
One reason that stores are presenting a clearer message may be leaner inventories. "We're more focused on who we are," said Julie Gilhart, the fashion director of Barneys New York. "We've had an amazing season with Prada, Jil Sander, McQueen, and Dries van Noten. But I think that's also because designers went to the core of what they do best." Among the themes that Barneys is emphasizing are folkloric knits and, as Ms. Gilhart put it, "a strong and sexy woman in that Helmut Newton way." That means Prada's pleated satin skirts and Balenciaga's high-waisted pants and bombers.
Kirna Zabete also bought those jackets, about 20, and sold most on preorders, said Sarah Easley, an owner. "There was a tremendous swing this season from a romantic Talitha Getty bohemian to a modern streetwise woman," said Ms. Easley, noting that other early best sellers include Rick Owens and Matthew Williamson. She also pointed out that designers improved their deliveries. "This is no time for bad behavior," she said. "You have to ship by July 15 or risk losing sales."
Perhaps because fall's new clothes are plainly wearable -- and nobody is trying to spin customers with the excuse that fashion is an escape from reality (so pony up!) -- price doesn't seem to be the deterrent it once was. Jacqui Lividini, the fashion director of Saks Fifth Avenue, said that one of the store's top luxury sellers has been an Oscar de la Renta velvet patchwork coat, for $11,200. The store also sold 10 Galliano pompom sweaters, $975 a pop, in two weeks.
All this jibes with what Mr. Wolfe is hearing from his retail clients, who say that price has slipped behind other consumer priorities. "What's most important now," he said, "is newness, fashion and fit."

HEADLINE: Small-Picture Approach to a Big Problem: Poverty 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
Though rich countries may be able to rescue middle-class economies like those of Uruguay and Brazil from crises simply by lending them billions of dollars, attacking the problems of the poorest countries is not so easy. Putting aside old, one-size-fits-all approaches to development, a new school of thought emphasizes more specific grass-roots solutions.
 A cadre of young economists who study development, including some of the most sought-after professors in the nation, are dissatisfied with supposed panaceas like balanced budgets, new infrastructure and financial stability. These economists are using basic insights about people's motivations and the flow of information to guide policy in emerging economies, one piece and one country at a time. 
 Esther Duflo, an associate professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, epitomizes the new development economics with her broad use of theoretical and statistical tools and her willingness to conduct research in the field. 
Ms. Duflo, whose work has placed her among the year's top picks for lifetime tenured positions, says she ultimately wants to find out why the world's poorest people almost always stay poor. That quest has led her to ask how governments and outside organizations can best help the citizens of poor countries, and why information and technology that can promote economic advancement spread less quickly in some settings than in others.
Old-line development economists often assumed that all people would follow textbook theories and that lessons learned in rich countries would stay true anywhere. Yet according to Ms. Duflo, "the level of discrepancy between what people do and what we as economists think they should do can be pretty substantial."
Ms. Duflo has studied the growth of the software industry in India, school construction in Indonesia, pensions in South Africa and household accounting in Ivory Coast. Her current research, conducted jointly with Michael R. Kremer of Harvard, has found, for example, that the use of fertilizer for growing maize in Kenya takes hold quickly among farmers who see demonstrations but that those farmers rarely share their new knowledge with others.
In the past, economists might have missed important discoveries like this by concentrating solely on the big picture. The International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and other teams of economic advisers often took the same message wherever they went, preaching the necessity of programs meant to clamp down on fiscal waste, stop inflation and improve foreign trade and investment.
Over the last half-century, these policies helped Chile, India, Israel and Mexico to stabilize their currencies and lay the groundwork for growth. Yet in Africa, the former Soviet bloc, many parts of Southeast Asia and Latin America, there is little to show for all the well-intentioned advice. Put simply, the same policies have not worked in every setting.
"To some extent the field has been driven by abandoning big-picture paradigms," Timothy J. Besley, director of the Suntory-Toyota International Centers for Economics and Related Disciplines at the London School of Economics, said in a recent e-mail message. "The problems are different country to country and even region to region within countries. These big-picture efforts are good for giving us inspiration, but probably not much good in making concrete progress within particular countries."
Though they do not entirely reject the macroeconomic policies of the old school, the new-style economists have begun to focus on smaller initiatives in public health, agriculture and education. Finding successes among these programs could yield lessons for broader policies.
"I see my job as trying to uncover little pieces of knowledge that can help us define policy for development," Ms. Duflo said.
Mr. Kremer, who is among the favorites to win the 2003 John Bates Clark Medal as the best American economist under 40, agreed. Now, he said, "it's less trying to find the magic key."
Even the World Bank has lately focused more attention on the most basic problems of poor countries, like public health.
The shift from promoting bulky, all-encompassing models to building simple truths from fieldwork and the theory of incentives has come late to development economics. Similar movements took hold a decade or two ago in labor economics and public finance. 
"The field of development was for a while split off from mainstream economics," Mr. Kremer said, "and so people in development weren't always using the most modern tools, either theoretically or empirically." With increasing rigor, he said, the field entered the mainstream and began to attract the best students.
After pioneers like Angus S. Deaton, who teaches at Princeton, came a wave of younger professors, often with hands-on experience in the field, who began to search for specific programs and strategies that did work. Even as junior faculty members themselves, professors including Mr. Kremer, Abhijit Banerjee of M.I.T. and Christopher R. Udry of Yale became mentors and collaborators for Ms. Duflo's generation of development economists. They set an example by conducting fieldwork on links among health, education, local politics and productivity in places like Kenya, India and Ghana.
Before Ms. Duflo rose to prominence, Mr. Banerjee said, "the data were there, the theory was there, and some of the tools were there, but there wasn't anybody who was on top of all of them."
"It's the bundle that's really impressive," he said. "She goes for big questions always."
A decade ago, Ms. Duflo was a history student at the Ecole Normale Superieure, a top college in France. She was interested in the problems of developing countries and spent some time working in Madagascar. While carrying out research in Moscow and planning a move into politics, Ms. Duflo met Thomas Piketty, another graduate of the Ecole Normale and an economics professor at M.I.T. at the time. He told her of the opportunities for research in economics in the United States and the string of graduates from the Ecole Normale who had pursued them.
"I had no clue this whole setup existed," she said. "I was interested in development before I was interested in economics, actually."
Ms. Duflo decided to switch to economics and completed a master's degree at Delta, an economics research center affiliated with the Ecole Normale. For graduate school, she went to M.I.T., where she took courses from Mr. Banerjee and Mr. Kremer. M.I.T., which almost never hires its own doctoral graduates, offered her the chance to stay on as an assistant professor.
Now, Ms. Duflo has offers of tenure from Princeton and Yale, as well as M.I.T. Mr. Banerjee said Ms. Duflo's popularity had to do with the renaissance in their field as well as her own abilities. "After many years, all the departments are looking for people in development economics," he said. "The field has become more visible," and students want to specialize in it.
Ben S. Bernanke, who was chairman of the economics department at Princeton before his appointment to the Federal Reserve Board early this month, said his department had been recruiting Ms. Duflo to expand its development offerings. Ms. Duflo spent last year at Princeton as a visiting professor and said it had been refreshing to spend time outside M.I.T.
Mr. Bernanke lauded Ms. Duflo's prodigious publishing in academic journals, an achievement that Mr. Banerjee attributed to her exceptional energy. That trait seems to characterize many young development economists, who often spend their summers working in Africa and Asia. "I don't sit in a room much," Ms. Duflo said. "You cannot do development without spending time in developing countries."
Other hot prospects in economics besides Ms. Duflo also dabble in development. Sendhil Mullainathan, another associate professor at M.I.T., has garnered interest from other institutions. Marianne Bertrand, who teaches at the University of Chicago, was offered a position at M.I.T. while she was teaching at Princeton. The three have collaborated on papers and could be seen sitting together, whispering and joking, during presentations at a labor studies conference by the National Bureau of Economic Research last month in Cambridge, Mass.
Not every leading economics department is eager to hire a development economist like Ms. Duflo, however. Stanford, for instance, has expressed little interest.
The reason, said Ilya R. Segal, a professor at Stanford who trained as a theoretician at M.I.T., stems from a long-running schism between two stereotypical schools of empirical, or applied, economics: one that favors data-intensive studies with only cursory theoretical models and another that insists on rigorous theoretical underpinnings for all assumptions. The data-intensive type is often attributed to Harvard and M.I.T., and the theoretical type is usually associated with Stanford, the University of Chicago and a handful of other prestigious universities in the Midwest known in academia as "freshwater" schools.
"The style of applied economics on the East Coast and at the London School of Economics tends to care very little about methods per se -- it is very eclectic," Mr. Besley said. "Perhaps the freshwater approach has a more definite sense of the 'right way to do economics.' " He added that Robert M. Townsend, a senior professor at Chicago, had done some valuable research in Thailand.
Ms. Duflo's work is "more the Cambridge style," Mr. Segal said. "People who do this kind of empirical work are very unlikely to get an offer from us." Even many senior faculty members at M.I.T., he said, would probably not get jobs at Stanford.
Ms. Duflo might disagree. "Development is a set of questions," she said. "It's not really defined by techniques."
Yet Mr. Banerjee conceded that the schism had led to criticisms of work produced by him and his colleagues. "It's very easy to paint yourself into corners," he said. "You know that your answers are being rated relative to the assumptions you make. You take your hits on that."

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TRAVEL: ON THE ROAD; 
Aversion to U.S. Airports Is Rooted in Stress Factor

BYLINE:  By Joe Sharkey; On the Road appears each Tuesday. E-mail: jsharkey @nytimes.com.

 BODY:
IN 20 years of business travel, Kathy Ewing has racked up 1.8 million frequent-flier miles on Delta Air Lines alone. That makes her, by anyone's definition, a frequent flier, one of those who form the backbone of the airline market. So anyone wondering about the long-term outlook for airlines would do well to consider her current travel patterns. 
 "When I can travel by car, I do. Driving is a lot less stressful than traveling by air," said Ms. Ewing, a consultant from Atlanta. "It used to be, I would fly on a business trip if it was more than a four-hour drive," she said. "Now that's up to about five hours and growing, simply because of the aggravation at the airport. In fact, a colleague of mine and I drove back and forth to Cincinnati last week, which is about an eight-hour drive from Atlanta." 
 Anyone wondering about the stubbornly lingering malaise in air travel might want to note the word "stressful" in Ms. Ewing's assessment, because it explains a fundamental objection that business travelers express when they are asked what is keeping them from getting onto airplanes the way they once did.
"The sense I'm getting anecdotally is that the hassle factor is really what is keeping people from traveling more than anything else -- more than the economics, more than concerns about safety," said Tim Winship, the publisher of Frequentflier .com, a travel Web site for frequent fliers. "People just don't want to go to the airport." 
There is nothing new about Mr. Winship's observation, other than the fact that it can still be made both routinely and accurately. The term "airport hassle," some industry analysts fear, has become firmly established in the travel lexicon. And the prospects for a change anytime soon are not compelling.
So far, most aviation industry officials have been reserved about criticizing the federal government's record in organizing and carrying out the much-heralded new era in airport security.
But with hundreds of sidelined airliners piling up -- an airplane storage site in the Mojave desert in California had 70 planes parked on the site last year; it now has more than 300 lined up -- and passenger traffic continuing to drop despite some of the lowest domestic fares in 15 years, the industry is starting to speak out more forcefully.
Last week, executives who manage 133 commercial airports sent a joint letter to United States senators urgently asking for an extension of the Dec. 31 deadline for ensuring that all passenger luggage be inspected by bomb-detection machines.
There is, incidentally, general consensus that the machines, each of which is the size of a sports utility vehicle and costs about $1 million, do not work all that well. Even their most enthusiastic supporters concede that the machines -- 1,100 of which are supposed to be in operation by Jan. 1, with thousands more to follow -- register false positives on about a third of the bags they handle. Their critics, meanwhile, say they are nearly worthless in realistically detecting explosives.
But that's not the tack the airport executives take. Instead, they argue that the Transportation Security Administration has to date managed to hire and train exactly 166 people to inspect baggage. "That leaves more than 21,400 screeners to be recruited, hired and trained before the Dec. 31 deadline," the airport bosses said, adding: "We earnestly believe that this is an insurmountable task."
"No one is more concerned about aviation security than the employees at our nation's 429 commercial airports," the letter said. "Yet with less than five months remaining, most of these airports, large and small, have yet to receive the T.S.A.'s final plans" for buying, installing and operating those machines.
Jeff Fegan, the chief executive at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, said airports were increasingly concerned about the "customer service" implications of the mandate.
Stubbornly sticking to the Dec. 31 deadline with inadequate equipment and poor planning will mean "very long lines that will most likely stretch outside the doors of the terminal building," he said of his own airport. "That's based on scientific modeling, on common industrial engineering -- how many people can you process, how many bags, in the amount of space and time that you have," he said. 
"The secondary issue, equally important, is whether or not the T.S.A. can ramp up with the staffing necessary to do any sort of job at the larger airports," he said. "We are anticipating the need for at least 2,400 employees from T.S.A. -- 1,200 for baggage screening and probably a similar number for security checkpoints" that have to be federally run by Nov. 19.
"The last I heard, they had less than 100 people who have been actually hired and are in training right now for this airport," Mr. Fegan said. 
Well, not to worry, the transportation agency said in a press release last week.
"T.S.A. continues its progress toward meeting our Nov. 19 deadline of a fully deployed federal screening work force in all 429 commercial airports," noted the press release, dated Aug. 13. "As of today, T.S.A. has deployed federal screeners to 32 airports."

HEADLINE: Advertising; 
Newspaper ads are down again, causing worries that the slump is not ending after 18 months.

BYLINE:  By Felicity Barringer 

 BODY:
JUST a month ago, the newspaper industry was somewhat optimistic about the near future after a mildly encouraging ad-page performance in the second quarter. But now it is having second thoughts.
 The first wave of July results from the newspaper chains shows that national and help-wanted advertising is still sluggish, ensuring that the industry's 18-month decline is not over. 
 Gannett reported yesterday that at USA Today, the nation's largest-circulation newspaper, ad volume was off 16 percent in July, compared with the same period in 2001; in June, the decline was 13 percent. Advertising volume last month at The New York Times dipped 5.7 percent compared with July 2001, after May and June fall-offs of 4 percent and 3 percent, respectively. 
And the downward trend was not confined to large national newspapers. The Minneapolis Tribune, the McClatchy Company's flagship, which reported in June that ad linage had increased 1.5 percent from June 2001, was back in negative territory in July, dropping 3 percent from the month the year before. 
"Whatever optimism we had a month or two ago is now muted, somewhat," said John Morton, a partner in the Barry Group, a media consulting company based in Bethesda, Md. And William Drewry, a Credit Suisse First Boston analyst who usually tends toward optimism, was guarded in his comments, saying that the monthly numbers have been too erratic to signal any trends, up or down.
"You're going to get variances of up a percent and down a percent until you get into the full-fledged recovery, which is not going to occur until well into 2003," Mr. Drewry said.
There are some asterisks attached to these trends. June 2002 had an extra Sunday -- a lucrative advertising day -- compared with July 2001. Mr. Morton said that two-thirds of the ad linage gains in June across the industry came from that extra Sunday.
And newspapers in smaller markets have done relatively better, in part because they tend to be less dependent on national advertising.
Walter E. Hussman Jr., the chief executive of Wehco Media, a privately held Arkansas-based company that publishes newspapers including The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette and The Chattanooga Times Free Press in smaller Southern markets, said: "Lots of papers are seeing revenue gains in retail which we hadn't seen in months. It does appear a little better."
But, he added: "The big dark cloud for all our newspapers is Kmart and what's going to happen with them. Over all, they are our second-largest advertiser."
Kmart, based in Troy, Mich., filed for bankruptcy protection in January; it has closed more than 280 stores and its ultimate fate is still unclear.
Like the Wehco situation, but on a much larger scale, Gannett's overall advertising picture is brighter than that of its largest newspaper, USA Today. Gannett, which publishes 93 newspapers aside from USA Today, most in smaller markets, reported yesterday that its total advertising revenue in July was up 1 percent on a 4 percent increase in ad volume, compared with July 2001. "The performance of the company's small- and medium-sized advertisers in its domestic newspapers outpaced the revenue performance of its largest advertisers," the company said yesterday in a press release.
Such smaller display advertisers are playing a larger role. As Mr. Hussman said: "Adversity brings about a lot of good things. It's focused us to work a lot harder on smaller advertisers." 
Some other display advertising categories, like automotive and real-estate, are showing continued strength for newspapers across the country. But classified advertising, particularly help-wanted ads, continues to be anemic.
Thus far, however, company executives say they see no need yet to go back and try to trim costs further. "I'm hoping not," said Steven B. Rossi, the president of the newspaper division of Knight Ridder, when asked if there was a need for further cuts. "If you look at June and July, were pretty much right on where our expectations were," he said. Knight Ridder trimmed more than 2,000 jobs, slightly less than 10 percent of its work force, in the last two years.
Gary B. Pruitt, chief executive of the McClatchy Company, said the number of jobs at his company -- now a little more than 8,000 -- has shrunk about 5 percent through attrition without any layoffs. Nor does Mr. Pruitt see the need to make any now. 
The Wall Street Journal, the flagship newspaper of Dow Jones, has been in a depressed category of its own throughout the slump, as its reliance on financial and technology advertising made it the most vulnerable newspaper. Its ad volume declined 17 percent in July, better than the 20 percent-plus declines of May and June, but worse than the 15 percent dropoff in April.
Mr. Drewry of Credit Suisse said that unless the company "sees a significant turnaround in the next two quarters, they're going to have to revise their cost assumptions and readjust the cost structure to a new reality of revenue levels."
But, after cuts of 860 jobs, or more than 11 percent of the work force over the last two years, the chief operating officer of Dow Jones, Richard F. Zannino, said he saw no need for more at the moment. "We already put in cost reductions that reflect what we expect the revenue rate will be for the rest of the year," he said.
So if things do not get worse than executives have predicted, further job cuts will probably be avoided. But even if they are not geting much worse, things are not getting better in a hurry.
Asked if the July dip signaled more bad news in the coming months, Mr. Pruitt of McClatchy said: "I hope not. It's unclear. It's not a trend but it certainly indicates we're not experiencing a robust recovery." 
But looking forward there could be one silver lining. In the third quarter of 2001, ad linage was dropping at double-digit rates every month at the largest newspapers. So, Mr. Pruitt, of McClatchey, said, "the industry should show ad revenue growth in the latter part of this year -- not because the economy is necessarily doing better, but because the comparisons will be so much easier."

HEADLINE: Moscow Journal; 
Russian Music Pirates Sail on Government Land

BYLINE:  By SABRINA TAVERNISE 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Aug. 18 

 BODY:
In an industrial corner of western Moscow, a sleek set of machines in an old printing plant stamp out thousands of compact discs around the clock. The plant owner, Oleg V. Gordiyiko, a stout, ruddy-faced former metals trader, gives tours with a look of pride.
 The plant has attracted attention recently for two reasons. It is suspected by the American music and film industries of turning out counterfeit compact discs. Its other remarkable trait is its location: a sign on the tall factory gate proclaims that the site belongs to none other than the Kremlin. 
 Mr. Gordiyiko's plant recently appeared in a list of Russian factories attached to a sharply worded letter on piracy sent by the American ambassador, Alexander R. Vershbow, to the Russian government. Mr. Vershbow wrote that a number of the suspect plants were operating on government property, some even at secret military sites. 
The accusation turned a decade-old economic issue into a matter of state and threw the weaknesses of Russian law enforcement into full, unflattering relief.
"It just seemed particularly blatant that a problem of this scale is going on at sites that are government owned," said a United States Embassy official who works on the issue.
Russia's vast pirated-music market is second only to China's. According to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, two out of every three music CD's in Russia are counterfeit. Piracy keeps legal album sales low, forcing Russian musicians to keep up frantic touring schedules to stay afloat, industry experts said.
Moscow is not alone in this problem -- pirated CD's and videos are available from sidewalk vendors in New York, too -- but the problem is huge here. While Russians buy 11.5 million legally made music CD's every year, they buy four times that amount in pirated CD's, some of which are imported from China, according to the federation. . Pirated CD's sell for about $2.50.
"Legal music is a niche market in Russia -- it's strange but true," said David Junk, head of Universal Music in Russia. "It's impossible to make serious money in the music business with piracy as it is."
For pirates, government facilities and military factories offer a wall of secrecy that protects against police inspections. For military plants, which now stand mostly idle after a precipitous drop in military procurement in the 1990's, disc production can be a lifeline.
Mr. Gordiyiko, 40, who leads the Intellectual Property Rights Committee at Russia's Chamber of Commerce, vigorously denied accusations of piracy. All 500,000 of the discs produced by his factory each month are legal, he said.
"The ambassador was given the wrong information" by American companies, he said. 
Even so, Mr. Gordiyiko acknowledges with a shrug that he had neither the time, resources nor inclination to check that each order he fills has the appropriate legal permission. 
"If I have a good printer, and someone prints money on it, why should I be responsible for the counterfeits?" asked Mr. Gordiyiko, who gave his last interview for this article from St.-Tropez, France. 
A government official had a similar reaction, when asked about Mr. Gordiyiko. The Kremlin's property office "just leases out the territory," said Vladimir Grigoriyev, an official in Russia's Press Ministry. "They don't particularly care what's being done in there."
Even so, high-level connections appeared to have helped last summer, when the police raided Mr. Gordiyiko's factory and confiscated stacks of discs they said were counterfeit. Soon after, the case was mysteriously closed and the police officers who led the raid were either fired or transferred. Police officials refused to comment on the case.
Mr. Gordiyiko "has strong protection from the government," said Konstantin Zemchenkov, director of the Russian Anti-Piracy Organization in Moscow.
Mr. Gordiyiko said that his ties to the Kremlin's former property manager, Pavel P. Borodin, had not given him an advantage. He said Mr. Borodin considered investing in the factory but settled on being its landlord.
The Russian government has moved against piracy in recent months. A new rule requiring factories to obtain licenses is intended to help bring the industry, unregulated since the Soviet Union's collapse, under control. "Everybody knows we were working to get this industry licensed," Mr. Grigoriyev said. "There was a huge lobby against it. But we put it into law." 
Some industry analysts contend that the major Western music and film studios make piracy worse by not manufacturing their products locally.
With a lack of orders for licensed goods, Russian factories sometimes turn to illegal production to stay afloat, said Chris Abel-Smith, the representative in Russia for American Home Entertainment companies, Paramount, Universal and DreamWorks.
Videocassettes are a case in point. Since Western studios began hiring Russian companies to produce them locally, the market for legally made movies on video has improved, Mr. Abel-Smith said.
Even as the government begins regulating large Russian factories, a smaller, new producer is gaining a foothold. On a recent morning at one of Moscow's largest music and film markets, a small stand of pirated recordings of rap music had drawn a small throng of skinny teenage boys. 
The salesman, 19, who would identify himself only as Aleksandr, smoothed rows of recordings by rap artists like Public Enemy and Snoop Doggy Dogg. 
When asked which of the Russian factories made the discs he was selling, Aleksandr began to laugh along with the boys browsing at his stand.
"I burn them myself," he replied.

PERSON: Clara Hemphill 

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES; 
A Guide in the Public School Maze, Mouse in Hand

BYLINE:  By LYNDA RICHARDSON 

 BODY:
CLARA HEMPHILL is used to asking tough questions. She was a reporter who covered welfare and poverty for Newsday. (New York magazine called her Miss Misery.) She was in Rome for The Associated Press and CBS, mixing it up with priests and cardinals as well as the mafia. She was sent to wartime Lebanon.
 It seems this would be great preparation for when Ms. Hemphill began shopping around for where to send her children in the New York City public school system. Yet even she found that penetrating the bureaucracy of the Board of Education was harder than prying information from the Vatican. 
 "I thought if I'm having trouble, other parents are, too," she said on a recent morning.
For the last seven years, Ms. Hemphill has made it her business to teach parents about the city's best public schools, writing three guidebooks that have become a sort of bible for urban parents. There's a newly revised edition on the elementary schools. The others are on middle and high schools. Now, she's moving onto the Internet.
At this moment, Ms. Hemphill, 48, who has and a no-nonsense manner, is up against a deadline as she leans over her computer in her cubicle at Advocates for Children, a nonprofit agency in Manhattan's garment district. She is the project director of www.Insideschools.org, a new Web site and guide to the city's 1,100 public schools that is to go online Sept. 2.
"I have to fill all this in," she mutters as she frowns at blank entries under the survival tips section. "And this needs a lot of work."
Looking over her shoulder, you glance through school profiles that are filled with basic facts like average class size and math and reading scores, in addition to attendance and graduation rates. But the site also offers descriptive tidbits (as Zagat's restaurant guides do) focusing on a school's emotional and physical aspects.
"We call it Insideschools because it's casting a flashlight on these dark little corners that nobody from the outside has seen for decades and letting us know about them," she says. "The Board of Education data and school report cards on every school in the district can lag behind by a year. It's like light from a distant star. And some of it is precise and some of it is misleading."
There are upbeat profiles, like one on Public School 107 in Park Slope, Brooklyn. Other profiles are scathing. The Graphic Communication Arts High School on West 49th Street is described as gloomy and prisonlike. Ms. Hemphill says she has has no intention of giving comfort to parents looking for an excuse to bail out on public education, adding that she is a big fan of public schools, particularly of their racial and economic mix.
"I think with energy and perseverance, most educated parents in the city can find good public school alternatives and help the city as a whole," she says. 
Ms. Hemphill is married to a historian, Robert Snyder, who teaches journalism at Rutgers University's Newark campus. They have two children, ages 6 and 9. The family rents a one-bedroom apartment in a rundown building on the Upper East Side. The couple sleeps in what used to be the dining room; her children share the bedroom. She moved to the apartment in 1987 when she was single, after returning from Rome.
The children attend the Manhattan New School, a public school about three blocks from their home on East 81st Street, which is in Community School District 2, one of the city's top districts. Ms. Hemphill says her children's school is as good as Brearley or Dalton, nearby private schools. O.K., you can just hear the grumbling parents: Oh, listen to her. She's not living in our neighborhood with its lousy schools. 
"I consider myself very privileged," she says firmly. "I feel very lucky, but my aim is to have every school as good as the one my kids go to."
So what's her take on the unwillingness of many white New Yorkers to even consider public schools as a plausible alternative; or to enroll their children in schools in which they will be in the minority?
"I think a lot of white parents are put off when their child is one, or one of two, white kids in a class," she says, pausing. "I think parents are more concerned about class than race issues. But if more white parents took the plunge, then there would be white kids in the schools."
ALTHOUGH her children's school is 70 percent white, she insists she would send her children to a school in which they were a minority as long the teaching quality was good. 
Ms. Hemphill describes her politics as left of center. She was raised in rural northeastern Connecticut. Her father was a college English professor and her mother, a retired regional planner, used to be a reporter for The Minneapolis Tribune. Her grandmother wrote articles for newspapers and magazines after World War I.
Though Ms. Hemphill says she reveled in her life as a reporter, she thinks her work now is more meaningful. Still, she's not wide-eyed about winning over loads of converts to public education.
"I don't know, maybe it's not a good enough argument," she says bluntly, letting out a laugh. "I haven't persuaded a lot of people. Friends say, 'Yes, yes, Clara. We've heard you talk about ethnic democracy, but what do you really think?' "

HEADLINE: A Success Story Among Connecticut Cities 

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn., Aug. 19 

 BODY:
In a state of wealthy suburbs and floundering cities, census figures being released Tuesday are providing new detail on the one big city in the state bucking the trend.
 Among Connecticut cities with more than 100,000 residents, only Stamford grew between 1990 and 2000, to 117,083 from 108,056. 
 Stamford's unemployment rate, according to the census data, is less than half that of the other large Connecticut cities. While median household income declined slightly from 1990 to 2000 all across the state, Stamford's figure, $60,556, is far higher than median household income in any of the other large cities. The next highest city is Bridgeport at $35,658. 
Mark Prisloe, the chief economist of the State Department of Economic and Community Development, said Stamford had succeeded in finding a niche in the current economy. "It's benefiting from its proximity to New York, but it is doing very well in its own right," he said. "It's the central part of the Gold Coast, affluent Fairfield County." 
Demographers have long mused about the decline of Connecticut's largest cities -- the impoverished old manufacturing centers of Bridgeport and New Haven, the faded mill town of Waterbury, the struggling insurance and banking capital of Hartford. 
Stamford's poverty rate, at just below 8 percent, is just about half of Waterbury's. Poverty is much more common in the other large cities: rates of 18.4 percent in Bridgeport, 24.4 percent in New Haven and 30.6 percent in Hartford. 
Stamford, 35 miles northeast of New York City, is now the state's fourth-largest city and has become a bustling corporate center. According to the census data being released this week, it has held onto low unemployment, high property values and steady median household income while the state's other large cities have declined in almost every category. 
The detailed census data suggest that Stamford has much more in common with service economy success stories in the southern and western United States -- places like Atlanta and Tempe, Ariz., that blend strong downtown business districts with comfortable suburban living within city lines -- than it does with its stagnant Northeastern neighbors. 
"We're clearly the exception now," said Mayor Dannel P. Malloy of Stamford, a Democrat serving his third term. 
"In many ways, we represent a perfect small urban environment," he said. "We have 45,000 people coming to work here every day from outside the city."
Stamford's strength is also visible in its extremely tight and expensive housing market. The median value of an owner-occupied residence in Stamford was $362,300, according to the 2000 Census. This is a decline of 4.89 percent from 1990, but the state's other large cities experienced steep declines in home values, ranging from 38 percent to 45 percent. 
From 1990 to 2000, Stamford had a net increase of 3,038 housing units, according to the census data, and a population increase of 3,454 households. Downtown residential construction was booming; vacancy rates in the city declined to 3.07 percent from 4.95 percent, a reflection of the strong demand.
Of course, the boom has come at a price. Nearly 30 percent of Stamford homeowners now spend more than 35 percent of their income on housing costs, according to the census, up from 22.5 percent in 1990. Among renters, 31.2 percent now spend more than 35 percent of their income on rent, up from 28.4 percent in 1990. 
Jack Condlin, the president of the Stamford Chamber of Commerce, traced the origins of Stamford's vitality to the 1970's when some large corporations decided to leave the bustle of New York City and move to Stamford. More companies followed and created a host of employment opportunities that attracted new residents and pushed housing prices up. 
"When housing costs go higher," Mr. Condlin said, "rents go higher. And what happed is the rents reached the magic level where developers said, 'Hey, I can develop.' In the downtown area we have got close to 5,000 new units of housing that have been built in the last 10 years and probably have another 5,000 units that are on the drawing table." 
Some of Stamford's largest population and housing growth occurred in the heart of the downtown business district in an area bounded roughly by Interstate 95 to the south, the Rippowam River to the west, North Street and Arlington Road to the north and Lockwood Avenue to the east. This area is also home to many of Stamford's corporations, including UBS Warburg, the financial services giant. 
Stan McMillen, a research project manager for the Connecticut Center for Economic Analysis, said Stamford had set itself apart from the state's other large cities beyond its success in becoming a corporate center. 
Unlike Waterbury and Bridgeport, which have a history of fiscal mismanagement and political corruption, Stamford is regarded as a well-run city. 
Unlike Hartford, which has a long reputation for high crime and badly run schools, Stamford is regarded as a safe, livable community. Mayor Malloy said Stamford had worked hard not just at economic development but on creating downtown amenities particularly in the arts and entertainment. 
Stamford's largest movie theaters, for example, are in the city center, not in a strip mall on the edge of town.

HEADLINE: Combatants in African Nations May Soon Give Peace a Chance 

BYLINE:  By MARC LACEY 

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, Aug. 19 

 BODY:
Four sets of peace negotiations are going on or about to start in Africa, raising cautious hopes that there could be breakthroughs in some of the continent's longest and most intractable conflicts.
 The climate of negotiations is markedly different than it was just four years ago. Then the conflicts in Sudan, Burundi, Congo and Somalia -- now all at or heading for the negotiating table -- were in full swing. Additional wars were raging in Angola and Sierra Leone and between Ethiopia and Eritrea, all of which have recently been settled. 
 Talks are going on in Machakos, Kenya, aiming to end Sudan's civil war, modern Africa's longest. Negotiations in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, are trying to resolve Burundi's civil strife. 
There also have been positive signs for the Congo conflict at the negotiating table, and next month factional leaders in Somalia, a country in outright anarchy, will talk to, instead of shoot at, their rivals.
"We seem to be in the midst of one of the ebbs of conflicts and one of the flows of peacemaking," said John Prendergast, director of the Africa program at the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based research organization.
John C. Danforth, President Bush's special envoy for peace in Sudan, cautioned today that "peace is something that is more than signing a piece of paper," but declared himself optimistic that the war between the Sudanese government and a rebel group might be nearing an end.
Analysts say, though, that lasting peace remains a long shot in all of the talks.
"Because the conflicts have been going on so long, you have to have a dose of realism," Walter H. Kansteiner, the American assistant secretary of state for African affairs, said in a telephone interview. "But there is good cause for optimism. We have a swath of territory through the heart of Africa that is on the verge of peace."
He added, "We haven't closed any deals yet, but we've been working hard on this."
One hopeful sign is the leading role that African leaders are playing in resolving the wars. The flurry of peace talks has coincided with the formation last month of the African Union, which made clear that it plans to police the transgressions of member countries.
South Africa has led the negotiations in Congo and Burundi, and Kenya has played a leading role in the Sudan and Somalia talks.
African governments clearly see an economic motive for peace. The New Partnership for Africa's Development, the economic blueprint endorsed by the African Union, calls on governments to cease their wars and human rights violations with the prospect of gaining a multibillion-dollar infusion of assistance from the West.
James D. Wolfensohn, president of the World Bank, spoke of the economic incentives for peace at a meeting in Tanzania in July.
"The issue of peace is something that is in Africa's hands," he told African finance ministers. The continent's leaders, he said, must come to the realization that "killing each other is a lot less preferable to living with each other."
Still, the complexities at play are evident in Burundi, still enduring a civil war. Earlier this month, cease-fire negotiations quickly began and ended.
Three separate rebel groups are fighting the forces of President Pierre Buyoya. Representatives of the main rebel movement, the Forces for the Defense of Democracy, led by Pierre Nkurunzizasat, sat across from government negotiators in the peace talks in Tanzania.
"We were at war for almost 10 years and created a great deal of hostility, so it is not easy to reverse all that in only four days," said Salvator Ntacobamaze, a representative of the rebels.
Burundi's current civil war began in 1993, when power shifted briefly from the Tutsi ethnic minority to the Hutu majority. Tutsi paratroopers assassinated the first Hutu president, setting off widespread killings of Tutsi.
With Nelson Mandela acting as the broker, a peace accord was finally reached in 2000. It created a power-sharing government to be led first by Mr. Buyoya, a Tutsi, and later by a Hutu. But rebels have continue to wage war in the countryside, turning the capital, Bujumbura, into a bunker of sorts.
Last Thursday, after four days of talks, the South African deputy president, Jacob Zuma, called a temporary halt to the negotiations to "resolve a few outstanding technical issues," which he declined to state.
Even if the talks revive, Burundi's government must contend with other rebel movements.
Separate talks are scheduled in the coming weeks with one of them, a faction of the Forces for the Defense of Democracy led by Jean Bosco Ndayikengurukiye. Then there is the smaller National Liberation Forces, which is set to enter into its own negotiations with the government. That group has its own rival factions.
Unless a cease-fire is signed with all of the parties, "the war will continue, if not escalate," predicted Jan van Eck of the Center for Conflict Resolution in South Africa, who has worked with Burundi's factions since 1995.
The conflicts in Congo and Sudan are just as complex.
In Congo, the government of President Joseph Kabila struck an agreement with Rwanda last month that could prompt the disarming of the main rebel faction in eastern Congo. Then, last week, Congo and Uganda agreed to resolve their differences.
But fighting continues to rage in Congo among combatants who have stayed away from peace talks.
In recent weeks, rebels representing the Congolese Rally for Democracy - Liberation Movement have clashed in the town of Bunia in northeastern Congo with Hema tribal fighters and Ugandan soldiers. More than 100 civilians have been killed in that fighting.
The war in Sudan, which began in the early 1980's, involves two main parties, the government and the Sudan People's Liberation Army. But a tentative agreement last month has done little to quell hostilities on the battlefield, and the International Crisis Group has called the talks "a shaky chance for peace."
The rebel group has been seeking to topple the government since 1983, in a conflict that has killed two million people and displaced millions more. 
The most recent round of fighting has taken place in the Western Upper Nile region of southern Sudan, where the government has carried out attacks aimed at moving the local people, and the rebels who live among them, away from oil installations.
"Despite the bad news on the military front -- the fact that there is no end in sight to the fighting -- these talks do represent the best chance for peace," said Mr. Prendergast, who was director of African affairs at the National Security Council in the Clinton administration.
Mr. Danforth agreed. He had been pessimistic about ending the long war, but after discussions with the parties in recent days, he declared himself "really optimistic."
Mr. Danforth said Mr. Bush remained especially focused on the war in Sudan, which has attracted the attention of a broad domestic constituency because of its religious and ethnic dimensions. "He said to me, 'If Sudan can work out a peace agreement, that should be possible anywhere in the world,' " Mr. Danforth said.
Next month, still another round of peace negotiations are to begin, to try to end the decade of anarchy in Somalia.
That may be the conflict with the dimmest chances of a quick resolution. The talks, scheduled for Eldoret in western Kenya, represent the latest of more than 15 attempts to bring peace to Somalia since its dictator, Mohammed Siad Barre, was overthrown in January 1991.
"If you were handicapping them at the racetrack you'd give Somalia 30 to 1 odds," said one Western diplomat who is involved in pushing the parties together.
Charles B. Snyder, the American deputy assistant secretary of state for Africa, said Somalia remained "at the beginning of a long struggle." Still, Mr. Snyder, a hardened former Army colonel and veteran Africa hand, said, "I like to think peace is contagious."

HEADLINE: Continental Recalls Tires; G.M., Vehicles 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 19 

 BODY:
Continental Tire North America announced today that it was recalling more than a half-million tires installed on Ford's sport utility vehicles because some of the tires had lost their tread.
 Over the last two years, tread separations have led to the recall of millions of Firestone tires that were used primarily on the Ford Explorer. 
 Continental began an investigation after a fatal accident in May in California involving a tire failure. 
The recalled tires were installed as original equipment on 106,701 two-wheel-drive Ford Expeditions and Lincoln Navigators from the 2000 and 2001 model years. About 60,000 of the tires were sold as replacements.
The recall involves the P275/60R17 size of the ContiTrac AW and General Grabber AW tires. They have Department of Transportation codes on the back that end with numbers 109 to 4400. They were made from March 1999 to October 2000.
Continental officials said property damage and personal injury claims against the tires increased significantly in April.
Documents filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration showed that Continental learned in May of the California accident, involving a Grabber tire failure.
In an unrelated action, the General Motors Corporation recalled nearly 720,000 cars and trucks today because of potential air bag problems.
The first recall includes 570,000 model year 2000 pickups and sport utility vehicles with a problem that could prevent air bags from working in frontal collisions. The affected models include Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups and Tahoe/Suburban and Yukon/Yukon XL S.U.V.'s. Only full-size pickups and S.U.V.'s built from February 1999 to February 2000 are affected.
The second recall includes 150,000 2002 and 2003 cars and trucks built from May July 2002. G.M. said the air bag on the driver's side might not fully inflate or break apart during inflation. 
G.M. said it had not received any reports of crashes or injuries related to the problems.

HEADLINE: Ford Stresses Business, but DisappointsEnvironmentalists 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

 BODY:
After a delay of almost four months, Ford Motor will release its third annual corporate citizenship report today. 
 The previous reports have earned the praise of environmental groups and the disapproval of some competitors because of Ford's frank discussion of subjects like the impact of sport utility vehicles on global warming and smog-forming pollutants. 
 But the latest report comes at a time of financial distress for Ford, the second-largest automaker. Environmental groups who have seen the report said the company had moved from candor to caution and had offered scant goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions or improving gas mileage. 
William C. Ford Jr., the chairman and chief executive, said "difficult business conditions make it harder to achieve the goals we set for ourselves in many areas, including corporate citizenship."
"But that doesn't mean we will abandon our goals or change our direction," Mr. Ford said.
Deborah Zemke, Ford's director for corporate governance, said the report had been delayed for a more thorough review because of the intense focus on corporate governance issues. She also said Ford had had its hands full with its turnaround effort.
"We tried to be more complete than as bold as we had been in the past," she said. "Our employees and our shareholders expect us to have a balanced perspective on the business right now, and I think they have every right to expect that."
The report says Ford improved the fuel economy of its S.U.V.'s 7 percent from the 2000 to 2001 model years, largely because it has introduced smaller S.U.V.'s like the Ford Escape and the Tribute from its Mazda brand. But the company's overall fuel economy has remained flat as less-efficient S.U.V.'s continue to account for a larger part of its product lineup. 
But this year's report lacked specifics on how to solve environmental problems and offered few alternatives to government regulations.
Carl Pope, the executive director of the Sierra Club, said in a statement that "this report takes a giant step in the wrong direction for Ford Motor Company, for American consumers and for the environment."
"It moves the ball backwards," Mr. Pope said, "by refusing to set firm goals for the future, and raises troubling questions about Ford's commitment to improving its environmental performance."
The company's first report, released in May 2000, created a stir with its frank discussion of the S.U.V. and its environmental impact, saying that "S.U.V. owners who use their vehicles for off-road recreation can damage the nature they and others seek to enjoy."
That a carmaker voluntarily made such an admission was groundbreaking, but it fitted with the image cultivated by Mr. Ford, whose speeches on subjects like global warming made him look like a sympathetic voice on the environment in an unsympathetic industry. In the first report, Mr. Ford joked that some regarded him as a "Bolshevik" when he joined the Ford board in 1988.
But much has changed in the nearly two and a half years since the first report. Ford has fallen from a position of financial strength to one of weakness, losing $5.5 billion last year and embarking on a major turnaround effort in January. Toyota and Honda continue to press gains in the United States market, while Nissan and, to a lesser extent, Chrysler are making progress in their comeback efforts. Perhaps of most immediate concern is the relative strength of General Motors, which is putting pressure on Ford by leading a price war. 
At the same time, S.U.V. sales continue to grow, and the company depends on the profit they provide. While Mr. Ford grapples with saving his great-grandfather's company, which turns 100 next year, his once- sterling relationship with environmental groups has suffered.
Environmentalists were embittered earlier this year when Ford supported the industry's lobbying campaign against a Senate effort to raise federal fuel economy requirements. An important industry trade group, supported by Ford, is also developing a legal strategy against legislation in California that would force automakers to reduce emissions of gases tied to global climate change. The Sierra Club recently focused on Mr. Ford in a radio spot, appealing to him "to do his part and to produce more fuel-efficient cars, S.U.V.'s and pickup trucks."
In the report, Mr. Ford's personal statement is largely devoted to discussing the revival plan. Discussion of the recent Senate fight over fuel economy standards is relegated to a small box at the report's end.
"It's not a candid discussion of what happened and what role Ford played in helping kill the legislation," said Robert K. Massie, the executive director of the Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies, an umbrella group that has affiliations with corporations like Ford and G.M.
Mr. Massie said his group was reconsidering its relationship with the two automakers after the Senate debate but also said that Ford was "still committed to the issues we care about and to transparency."
"This is a company with one foot on the accelerator and one on the brake," he said.

HEADLINE: Oil Prices Near $30 a Barrel, a 15-Month High 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The price of crude oil is closing in on $30 a barrel and rose to its highest level in 15 months yesterday. It has surged 50 percent this year and is already a drag on the weakening economic recovery in the United States, some economists say.
 A further increase in the price, which rose 1.7 percent yesterday, to $29.84 a barrel, could put pressure on the Bush administration to work for lower prices and turn the spotlight on the next meeting of the OPEC oil ministers, who are scheduled to meet in Osaka, Japan, next month. 
 "With oil prices over $29 a barrel, both OPEC and consuming nations are getting nervous," said Michael Rothman, senior energy market specialist at Merrill Lynch. 
James E. Glassman, senior United States economist at J. P. Morgan, said that higher oil prices had been a modest drag by themselves on the economy. The effect has been tempered somewhat by the fact that they rose from abnormally low levels in 1999 and by the fact that many oil producers, like Mexico, buy a lot of American products and have more to spend as oil prices climb. But, he added, "if oil prices stay at $30 a barrel, it's going to be an issue."
Oil prices had peaked this year at $29.36, in May, and had then declined as low as $24.12 a barrel in June, in part because of slowing growth here and abroad.
But repeated reports about a possible United States invasion of Iraq and new data showing that oil inventories are below levels a year ago have helped push prices higher.
Then yesterday, the acting Kuwaiti oil minister said in Moscow that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would not raise production quotas unless the price of oil rose above $30 a barrel. "It's better to continue without quotas," Sheik Ahmad al-Fahd al-Sabah told reporters, according to Bloomberg News.
While these comments were bullish for the price of oil, Mr. Rothman said he was not sure that the Kuwaiti oil minister was speaking for other OPEC nations. Higher oil prices are a threat to the global economic recovery and that, Mr. Rothman said, "doesn't seem to be in keeping with the bigger goals of OPEC."
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the price of crude oil for September delivery rose 51 cents, to $29.84 a barrel. The last time the price was that high was in May of last year. Because the September futures contract expires today, investor focus starting today will be on the price of oil for October delivery.
The price of that contract rose 29 cents, or 1 percent, yesterday, to $28.80. The focus on this new price could cause some confusion because it is lower than yesterday's closing price for the September contract. But it still reflects a price of oil that is at or near recent highs, which could bring pressure on OPEC to increase production.
Sheik Ahmad said that he did not expect OPEC oil ministers to approve an increase in production unless the price of OPEC's special basket of different types of crude oils went above $28 a barrel, according to Reuters. The price of that basket rose to $26.58 a barrel on Friday, and a move to $28 would mean the price of the oil for October delivery should be above $30.
According to Merrill Lynch, end-of-July petroleum supplies are forecast to be just three million barrels above normal and moving over time to below normal.
The main worry created by the constant talk about invading Iraq is not the loss of Iraq's oil production in an attack but its effect on the stability of the Middle East and the possibility that Iraq would strike out against its neighbors, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, and impede their ability to produce oil.
OPEC's effort to manage the price of oil at about $25 a barrel began with cuts in production after the price of oil plunged to a low of $11.37 a barrel in early 1999. Since then, OPEC has worked for greater control by persuading non-OPEC nations, like Russia and Mexico, to agree to production constraints.
But while the price has been pushed higher, production quotas are often ignored by many countries. Some analysts estimate that overproduction adds more than a million barrels a day to output. But this overproduction this year might have been offset recently by a decline in the production from Iraq.
Mr. Rothman does not make price predictions, but he thinks that in the near term the price is more likely to decline than rise. He argues that the invasion of Iraq, if it does happen, is not going to take place soon. And he thinks that OPEC will work to increase production to keep the price from moving much higher.
Increasing production quotas to stop a price surge would be consistent with past OPEC decisions, including production increases in 2000 as the price of oil shot above $35 a barrel.

After sitting nearly half empty in the wake of Sept. 11, the residential buildings that once ringed the World Trade Center are almost as full as they were before the terrorist attack, a survey of more than 7,000 units in the area by The New York Times has found. 
 With deep discounts from landlords and government programs promising rebates, vacancy rates have fallen to slightly below 5 percent over all -- and in many buildings, to zero -- compared with average highs of 45 percent in the months after the disaster. Six of the 26 buildings surveyed by The Times have filled up, while another seven are only a few apartments shy of doing the same. 
 Condominium sales are also unusually brisk, fetching some of the highest prices in years, as the large real estate investors who have characterized the area slowly give way to a stream of individual owners looking for a place to settle down. 
Just 10 months ago, the neighborhoods were digging themselves out of what looked like a nuclear winter, residents were fleeing with the uncertainty of refugees and even the wealthiest landlords were left wondering how they would pay their bills. Today, joggers and baby strollers ply the narrow paths once crammed with dump trucks and moving vans, and only the slightest sheen of ashy grit still clings to the buildings. The thousands of apartments that stood so precariously vacant have dwindled to a few scattered dozen, all of them going fast. 
"It was a mistake to believe that this area was going to fold up," said Timothy S. Carey, president of the Hugh L. Carey Battery Park City Authority, which owns 92 acres of riverfront property skirting ground zero. "We're a community that's already been reborn." 
The Times survey, conducted with the participation of owners, managers and city officials, represents most of the housing within a four-block radius of the trade center. In all, 34 buildings were identified, and 26 of them provided occupancy data.
With the replenishment of the neighborhood has come a set of new faces. In some buildings, more than 70 percent of current tenants moved in well after the rents came tumbling down and word of federal subsidies for renters had begun to spread. 
"When people smell a bargain, they will pack up and move to wherever it is," said Arnon Barzilai, a real estate broker in the area. "That stopped the bleeding, and now prices are creeping up again."
After Sept. 11, even before many of the streets were open and columns of moving trucks rolled in, landlords rushed to curb the outward migration, reducing rents by as much as 25 percent and sweetening the pot with offers of one month free. Still, leases were broken by the dozen, and many tenants, having scrambled for a place to land during the weeks their homes remained off-limits, returned only to cart off their belongings. 
Bracing for the worst, some landlords were secretly relieved when only half of their tenants left. Others emerged with no more than a quarter of their units left vacant. But in some buildings, especially those that leased large blocks of units to corporations for employee housing, no fewer than three-quarters of the units suddenly sat empty. 
"The way people were running out of here like crazy, if someone had told me we'd be full in less than a year, I would have laughed in their face, if I didn't cry first," said Charles Mehlman, a senior vice president at the Lefrak Organization, one of the owners of Gateway Plaza, the first and largest apartment complex in Battery Park City. With banks of windows obliterated, roughly 700 of Gateway's 1,711 apartments remained vacant after the complex reopened. By next month, though, its owners expect it to be full once more.
What tipped the balance, brokers and landlords agree, is a $300 million rental assistance program first announced in February but only finalized last month. Months before the federal government had actually approved the money, brokers were busily advertising the grants, which offer up to $12,000 to people who move into the immediate vicinity of the fallen towers, and even more to families already living there before Sept. 11 who chose not to leave. 
But even in the absence of subsidies, real estate in the surrounding neighborhood rebounded. By the first quarter of 2002, with many of the area's major arteries still shut down, condominium sales had already begun to outpace those of recent years. 
In TriBeCa, buyers were paying $664 a square foot, 17 percent more than the same period in 2001, according to the Real Estate Board of New York. Nearby in Battery Park City, the median price climbed to $442 per square foot, a 7 percent increase from the previous year -- not a record jump, but far from expected given the freshness of the tragedy. 
"Everybody was surprised that the effect of Sept. 11 wasn't more lasting," said Greg Heym, the board's chief economist. "People expected that the downtown market would just stop, and that wasn't the case. In fact, there was really no prolonged effect." 
Not that all has gone smoothly. Nearly all of the condominium buildings in Battery Park City are withholding back rent totaling $11 million from the authority that owns the land. The authority calls the rent strike unwarranted, considering that the sales prices have only increased since the disaster. The condominiums, by contrast, question why they should hand over rent when much of what they pay for, like parks and streets, was unusable for months. 
Others worry that the area's demographic has shifted, away from families with children toward a younger set, those willing to double up and pay rents that are now almost back to what they were before the disaster. Public School 89, the elementary school nestled in Battery Park City, expects 28 percent fewer children when it reopens next week, reflecting the trepidation of families who are not quite ready to return. 
"In some way I certainly feel a little guilty in leaving the neighborhood," said Dr. Lewis Gross, a former community board member and Little League president who moved his wife and three sons from Battery Park to Montauk, N.Y., within weeks of the attack. 
It was only supposed to last a year. Then they would be back. But the schools were so surprisingly good, the endless green and blue so soothing and their plans malleable enough to change. "The uncertainty of living there, the continued stress," Dr. Gross said. "That's something I'm glad to avoid."

HEADLINE: Mt. Sinai Says It Is Replacing Its President 

BYLINE:  By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
Facing a staggering financial crisis that is forcing it to make deep cuts in its services, Mount Sinai Medical Center announced yesterday that the president of its hospital, Barry R. Freedman, was being replaced. 
 Mr. Freedman, who has been associated with the hospital for 25 years, many of those in top leadership positions, will be succeeded by Dr. Larry Hollier, now a senior vice president and the hospital's chief of surgery. It was a decision that Mount Sinai's trustees described as an attempt to begin remaking the hospital into more of a "physician-led organization." 
 During Mr. Freedman's tenure, the hospital began an ambitious building program, increased admissions and managed for a while to cut its average length of stay, increasing revenues. But as the landscape of health care financing began to shift during the 1990's, and after the medical center entered into what became a troubled merger with New York University Medical Center in 1998, the hospital's fortunes began to decline.
Mr. Freedman is departing at a time when financial losses have mounted to the point that the hospital has begun aggressively cutting outpatient clinic services and staff. Administrators say that the combined operating-budget deficits of the hospital and the medical school have grown to $100 million.
In the midst of these problems, the hospital suffered a serious blow to its reputation earlier this year when it was temporarily barred from performing partial-liver transplants after a donor died in its care in January.
The State Health Department found, among other things, that the transplant unit had too few nurses and that the donor who died, Mike Hurewitz, 57, had been supervised by a first-year surgical resident who was in charge of 34 patients and described herself as overwhelmed.
Dr. Kenneth I. Berns, the chief executive of the medical center, which is composed of the hospital and the Mount Sinai Medical School, praised Mr. Freedman as "a caring, thoughtful, steadfast leader who has made countless contributions" to the hospital's growth.
Mr. Freedman, who could not be reached last night for comment about the hospital's decision, was one of the executives at the medical center who devised the idea of the merger with N.Y.U. Medical Center.
The merger was planned in 1996 as a wave of similar consolidations swept through the medical industry. Mr. Freedman and other officials at both hospitals said that the combination of the two powerful East Side medical centers would create an institution whose prestige would virtually guarantee enough revenue to keep its medical research alive at a time of deep cuts in both government and private reimbursements for medical care.
The new institution would have been the largest medical center in New York City and among the largest in the nation. But the merger stalled almost from the start, and by last year, the two medical centers had decided to keep their schools and departments apart and were conducting separate advertising campaigns.
N.Y.U. Medical Center seemed to survive the relationship relatively unscathed, but Mount Sinai entered into a prolonged a state of administrative flux. For more than a year and a half after the departure in September 2000 of John W. Rowe, the chief executive of what was then Mount Sinai N.Y.U. Medical Center and Health System, his position went unfilled and Mr. Freedman was acting head of the center.
Dr. Berns, who had been vice president for health affairs and dean of the school of medicine at the University of Florida Health Science Center, was appointed to take over Mount Sinai Medical Center and began this spring.
Last year, Dr. Arthur Rubenstein, dean of the medical school and a leading candidate for the chief executive's job, left for a post at the University of Pennsylvania and the medical school deanship remains unfilled.
The new choice to head the 1,000-bed hospital, Dr. Hollier, is a highly regarded vascular surgeon who has been at Mount Sinai since 1996. Before that, he held leadership positions at, among other places, the medical school at Louisiana State University and at the Mayo Clinic.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL; 
Padres' Owner Ready to Sit For a Season

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
While players were setting a strike date last Friday, Yankees officials were meeting with Major League Baseball officials to express their concerns about the impact the clubs' collective bargaining goals would have on the Yankees.
 But as a glaring example of the thinking 180 degrees from the Yankees', the owner of another club, John Moores of the San Diego Padres, said yesterday that he was prepared to shut down for an entire season to get the kind of deal he thinks the clubs need. Moores added that he thought many other owners would be with him. 
 These developments and comments came as baseball hurtled toward another work stoppage, set for Aug. 30. The Yankees' money is a focal point of the negotiations for a labor agreement. The other clubs want it, the Yankees are willing to give up some of it but not all that Commissioner Bud Selig wants, and the players union is the best ally George Steinbrenner, the team's principal owner, has. 
Moores views the union and its members differently.
"If they strike, I'll be prepared to sit out a season," he said in a telephone interview. "I won't like it, but I'm prepared to do it. I'm not going to be a part of a crazy system where we have to keep raising ticket prices."
Asked if he thought other owners were prepared to react similarly to a strike, Moores said: "I'd say 8 or 10, off the top of my head. It's crazy. It costs a lot of money to shutter a franchise for a season. You just don't lock the doors. But I'd rather do that than have a bad labor deal."
Moores, who has owned the Padres for eight years, is part of a group of owners perceived by the players and some other owners as hawks.
That group was said to have held at least one conference call last week to solidify its position and to pressure Selig into holding a firm line. A management official said an owner told him he had been asked to participate in such a conference call Aug. 13, the day after the union delayed setting a strike date.
But Moores and three others who were possible participants denied that any calls took place. Selig concurred and also denied that any owners tried to pressure him last week into holding to his bargaining stance on revenue sharing and on a luxury tax on payrolls.
"It's as wrong as wrong can be," Selig said. "There were no conference calls. There are people with all kinds of different views. Has there been any discussion by this so-called hawkish group? It's wrong; it's a bogus issue. There isn't a hawkish group putting pressure on me. I'm the one who knows who I talk to. I haven't talked to anyone."
It is Selig's stance on the key economic issues that has concerned the Yankees, who know that whatever economic system emerges from these talks, they will be the biggest payer. When club officials requested a meeting to state their views, they were initially rebuffed.
The unwillingness of anyone to grant the Yankees' request for a meeting is what might have prompted Steinbrenner to speak out recently in an interview with The New York Times and risk incurring a $1 million fine for violating the commissioner's demand for silence on labor issues.
But the Yankees had the meeting last Friday and laid out their case to management's lead negotiators, who responded that talks were continuing and that it was not known what a new economic system would cost the Yankees or any other club.
The Yankees are so concerned about what might happen that they are contemplating legal action. They have retained the noted lawyer David Boies, and he has been working on a lawsuit they would bring against the commissioner and baseball if they consider the results of negotiations too financially onerous. 
The Yankees paid $29 million, more than any other club, in revenue sharing last year. Under the clubs' initial proposals in these talks, the Yankees would have paid nearly $100 million in revenue sharing and a luxury tax on their payroll, at $171.2 million the largest in pro sports. 
Those potential payouts have come down as the owners have lowered their demands, but under the management proposals on the table, the Yankees would pay about $80 million, based on last year's revenue and this year's payroll. 
The difference in the tax cost to the Yankees between the clubs' proposal and the union's plan would be $100 million over four years.
Yankees officials made those points Friday and explained what the effect would be on their ability to function, but they will nevertheless remain the target of the clubs whose revenues are dwarfed by the Yankees' revenue.
The Yankees are not isolated from the other clubs, but there are not many that oppose the system Selig seeks. The Mets, the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Seattle Mariners are among the handful of other teams that may question the severity of the system. 
At the other extreme are six or eight executives considered the management hard-liners. That group includes Moores, David Glass of Kansas City, Drayton McLane Jr. of Houston, Jerry Reinsdorf of the Chicago White Sox, Carl Pohlad of Minnesota, Tom Hicks of Texas and Stan Kasten, president of the Atlanta Braves. "Stan Kasten has the strongest views of anyone," a management official said. "He's very upfront about it."
A baseball lawyer who had also heard about conference calls among some or all of these owners said he was told that Moores had initiated the calls. While denying any role he played, Moores said he had lunch in San Diego last Friday with Hicks, who later that day made strong comments about the economic system in an interview with The Dallas Morning News.
Kasten, McLane and Reinsdorf joined Moores in denying they participated in any conference calls last week. Glass and Pohlad did not return telephone calls.
"We had a conference call of the executive council, and that was one of the things Bud shared with us, that some of us had been having conference calls," McLane said. "That is absolutely untrue."
Moores did not say what other clubs he thought might be willing to lose a season in an attempt to get the labor deal they want, but they would most likely come from this group. 
Owners of some low-revenue teams, like Kevin McClatchy of Pittsburgh, have also talked about the need to have a new system that eliminates payroll disparity. But McClatchy, and others, have told people their teams cannot afford a work stoppage of any duration.
Some on the management side believe that once the players go on strike, some owners would say, "Once and for all, let's fix the system and go to a harder-line approach than where we are now; let's fight this out to the end."

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Europe: Germany: Economic Growth Slow Again 

BYLINE:  By Mark Landler (NYT) 

 BODY:
 Germany's economy continues to sputter, growing just 0.25 percent in the second quarter, according to a report released yesterday by the Bundesbank, the German central bank. 
The estimate, which analysts expected, means the German economy has stagnated for five consecutive quarters. The Bundesbank said the rising euro and the weakening of crucial export markets like the United States could choke off an expected rebound in exports. "The quick appreciation of the euro against the U.S. dollar since April has raised concern that the external impetus, which initiated the economic turnaround, may wane and seriously hurt the recovery," the report said.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 28, 2002

 CORRECTION:
A listing of the World Trade Center dead or missing issued by the New York City medical examiner and published in late editions on Aug. 20 misspelled a victim's given name. He was Michael McCabe, not Micheal. It also gave erroneous middle initials for a victim. He was Stephen J. Fiorelli Sr., not S. R. And it omitted the names of two victims who died of injuries later. They were Randy Drake, who died on Sept. 22, and David Bernard, who died on Dec. 11.

HEADLINE: Technology Briefing Hardware: Hewlett To Make Low-Cost Computer 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News (Compiled by Gary Bradford) 

 BODY:
 Hewlett-Packard, the world's second-largest computer maker, said yesterday that it would begin selling a $549 business computer that includes a low-cost Athlon processor from Advanced Micro Devices. 
The computer also features graphics chips from Nvidia Inc., Hewlett said in a statement. The Athlon processor used in the Compaq D315 is cheaper than comparable semiconductors from Intel. Dell Computer, a Hewlett rival, has gained customers after lowering prices. Computer makers are seeking to bolster sales as the economy cools and customers cut purchases, analysts have said. Shares of Hewlett, based in Palo Alto, Calif., fell 6 cents, to $15. They have fallen 18 percent since the company completed its $25.3 billion acquisition of Compaq Computer in May.

HEADLINE: Qwest to Sell Yellow Pages For $7 Billion 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN with BARNABY J. FEDER 

 BODY:
Qwest Communications International, the debt-laden telephone company, agreed last night to sell its yellow pages directories business to a group of financiers for $7 billion in a move that would help it avert a bankruptcy filing.
 Under the agreement, Qwest, the dominant provider of local phone service in 14 Western states, will sell its yellow pages unit to the politically influential Carlyle Group and Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe, executives close to the auction said. The deal would be the largest leveraged buyout since Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company's hostile takeover of RJR Nabisco in 1989. 
 The sale, which was approved by Qwest's directors and is expected to be announced today, averts an immediate cash squeeze at Qwest that could have forced it to file for bankruptcy protection before the end of the year.
Qwest's cash crisis is so acute -- it has $26.3 billion in debt with billions coming due soon -- that it was recently forced to take a $500 million bank loan at a 13.5 percent interest rate, higher than the interest rate for most companies in bankruptcy. 
The sale comes as Qwest announced yesterday that it would change the way it accounted for the yellow pages unit and restate results for at least 2001 and the first half of this year. Qwest said that it would now recognize sales and expenses over the life of a phone directory instead of when it is published. The change will reduce 2001 directory sales by 5 percent, or $80 million.
Last month, Qwest disclosed that it had incorrectly accounted for more than $1.1 billion of transactions from 1999 to 2001. The company notified the Securities and Exchange Commission last week that it could not properly file its most recent earnings reports because of uncertainty about the outcome of continuing investigations into its accounting by the S.E.C. and the United States attorney's office in Denver, where Qwest is based.
The sale of Qwest's yellow pages business, called QwestDex, ends a months-long auction, complicated by worries about the unit's accounting, that included bids from nearly every major financier and investment fund in the country.
The $7 billion offer topped a $3 billion offer from the consortium of Thomas H. Lee Partners, Bain Capital and Providence Equity Partners for only part of the business. Qwest's board had considered whether to take the $7 billion offer for the entire business, which could take months to close because of regulatory concerns, or take the $3 billion, which would have closed faster.
The accepted deal is a compromise in timing. The winning bidders will pay $2.75 billion for Qwest's yellow pages businesses in its eastern region in a transaction that is expected to close in three months, the executives said. The western region, which mostly includes businesses acquired in the purchase of U S West, will be bought in six to nine months. The second part will take longer because some of those states still regulate Qwest and must approve the sale. They are expected to, in effect, claim a portion of the proceeds as a condition of approval and disputes over the issue could drag out the sale.
Qwest's yellow pages operations, which include 313 directories, generated $1.6 billion in revenue last year. Its largest markets include Phoenix, Minneapolis, Seattle, Denver and Portland, Ore.
Initial bids came in from a changing lineup of consortiums of investment funds, including the Texas Pacific Group, which invested last week in US Airways; the Blackstone Group; Kohlberg Kravis Roberts; Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst; Apax Partners; Goldman Sachs Capital Partners; CSFB Private Equity; Madison Dearborn Partners; the Apollo Group, run by Leon Black; and Oaktree Capital Management. Other suitors like Liberty Media, run by John C. Malone and the R. H. Donnelley Corporation, an advertising marketer, also made bids.
One of the winning bidders, the Carlyle Group, is a Washington investment company with a roster of prominent partners and advisers, including former President George Bush, former Prime Minister John Major of Britain, former Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Arthur Levitt, the former chairman of the S.E.C.
Spokesmen for Qwest and the winning bidders declined to comment last night.
Private equity firms like yellow pages operations because they tend to be dependable cash generators, unlike some of the telecommunications businesses that burned buyout firms after they bought them in the 1990's. 
Directory businesses traditionally produce enough extra cash that the buyout firms calculate they can pay back the loans they will have to take to acquire them, yet still produce a profit. The lenders involved include J. P. Morgan Chase, Lehman Brothers, Wachovia Securities, Deutsche Bank and Bank of America.
How much the sale helps Qwest in the long run remains to be seen, though its short-term prospects appear brighter. "This should fund them for the next few years," said Patrick Comack, an analyst at Guzman & Company. 
Still, Qwest's business has clearly been deteriorating in recent months. In its preliminary earnings report, issued early this month, Qwest said that it lost $1.14 billion on revenue of $4.32 billion in the second quarter. That loss included $740 million associated with the bankruptcy of KPNQwest, its European affiliate, and an increase of bad-debt reserves of $119 million to cover money it may not be able to collect from WorldCom, a large customer. Excluding these and other smaller one-time charges, Qwest lost $210 million, or 13 cents a share, from operations. And it warned analysts that their projections for the rest of the year were too optimistic.
The sale is likely to shift attention to the next crucial step in Qwest's survival plan -- receiving prompt approval to re-enter the long-distance phone business in its home territory. Like the other regional Bells, U S West, the Qwest subsidiary that provides local phone service, has been barred from also offering long distance in its home market since the breakup of AT&T until it can prove that other companies are able to connect to its network and compete for the local market.
Although the long-distance business is flagging over all, the regional phone companies like SBC Communications and Verizon that have been allowed back into it in portions of their home territories have rapidly picked up 20 percent or more of the long-distance business and achieved attractive returns by bundling it with other services.
Qwest has filed for approval to offer long distance in all 14 states and has been telling Wall Street it hopes to receive approval in most if not all before the end of the year. Once the approvals are in hand, it will take six months to a year to enter the markets and pick up enough business to start generating the positive cash flow Qwest desperately needs to handle the huge debts coming due during the rest of this decade. Like other traditional phone companies, Qwest is experiencing an erosion of its long-distance business outside its home territory by competition from wireless phone companies and is facing increasing competition in the broadband segment from cable companies.
Qwest has gained little traction so far in its effort to provide packages of high-profit services to big businesses nationwide and overseas, a market in which AT&T, the industry leader, appears to be picking up most of the business generated by customers nervous about the future of second-ranked WorldCom. And smaller local phone companies that run their operations in Qwest's territory by connecting to Qwest's network are grabbing market share, said Scott Cleland, an analyst at Precursor Group who expects Qwest to file for bankruptcy this year.
Lehman Brothers advised Qwest, while J. P. Morgan Chase advised the winning bidders.

HEADLINE: Profit Down at WPP Group, And Chief Is NotOptimistic 

BYLINE:  By ALLISON FASS 

 BODY:
Emphasizing a gloomy advertising climate, Sir Martin Sorrell, the chief executive at the world's largest agency company, the WPP Group in London, forecast a slow recovery yesterday and warned that WPP's operating profit margins might not match last year's.
 The remarks were made as WPP posted its results for the first half of the year, including a 17 percent decline in pretax profits, to $303.8 million. 
 The financial performance mirrored the difficult economic conditions in the industry, the company said. 
WPP said it would not meet its original target of a 15 percent operating margin, and would probably fall short even of the 14 percent it posted last year.
Sir Martin, who these days is the most pessimistic of the top advertising agency executives, has said that improved performance is unlikely this year, and a recovery may not take hold in the industry until 2003 or even 2004.
While some agency executives had held out hope that a recovery might be possible this year, Sir Martin said that a turnaround might not be seen until spending for the Summer Olympics in Athens and the United States presidential election gear up in 2004.
Revenue fell to $2.83 billion in the first half, off 2 percent from the period in 2001, the company said. Excluding the impact of recent acquisitions, revenue fell 8 percent.
Despite the challenging environment, WPP said it had brought in $1.8 billion in billings of net new business in the period. Public relations was the weakest business component for WPP; market research was among the strongest.
Shares of WPP, which owns agencies like Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide, J. Walter Thompson and Young & Rubicam Advertising, fell 6.4 percent, to $:4.68 ($7.16) in London trading. WPP agencies work for marketers like the Ford Motor Company.
The company also said it would join the growing list of companies treating stock option grants as an expense. 
"Management was negative as usual but they're notoriously negative on the outlook so I don't think people were bothered by that," said Alexia S. Quadrani, an analyst who covers advertising and marketing services at Bear, Stearns in New York.
The firm lowered earnings and margin targets for the year for WPP, but maintained revenue and its attractive rating on the stock.

Oil Futures Drop a Bit as Supplies Rise 2%

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Supplies of crude oil increased last week for the first time in three weeks, the American Petroleum Institute said yesterday.
 Supplies rose 6.64 million barrels, or 2.3 percent, to 302.3 million barrels, the institute said in its weekly report. 
 "Crude oil stockpiles have rallied back above year-ago levels," said Phil Flynn, vice president and senior market analyst at Alaron Trading in Chicago. The "surplus in crude signals that things might not be as tight as we thought," he said.
The news pushed crude oil futures lower in electronic trading. Crude oil for October delivery was down 39 cents, at $28.38 a barrel, late yesterday in electronic trading in New York.
Earlier in the day, in the open-cry session, the September contract, which expired yesterday, rose 27 cents, closing at $30.11 a barrel. Oil for October delivery fell 3 cents, to $28.77, in the open-cry session.
The increase in inventories was the biggest since the week ended April 26. Most of the rise, 5.3 million barrels, occurred on the Gulf Coast, the nation's refining and importing heartland. Supplies were 329,000 barrels above year-earlier levels compared with a deficit of 11.7 million in the report last week.
The drop of 9.5 million barrels reported last week was the biggest decline since June 2001 and included a drop of 6.1 million barrels in the Gulf Coast region.

Eithertoo easy or too tough, the debt raters always have critics.

BYLINE:  By Leslie Wayne 

 BODY:
After the collapse of Enron, the nation's rating agencies were hauled before Congress and over the coals by many who claimed they failed to warn investors of problems at Enron and dozens of other businesses. Now the same agencies are being criticized for just the opposite -- that they are too quick to downgrade companies at the slightest hint of trouble, adding more turmoil to already volatile markets. 
 If the pendulum had swung to an overly soft view of corporate health, critics now say the agencies have become too strict. "I'm stunned by how ratings agencies have switched from being docile to all of a sudden being proactive," said Jack Hersch, a partner in Cypress Management, a San Francisco hedge fund specializing in distressed securities. "And in doing that, they are creating problems where none may have existed." 
 Problems are just what the skittish markets do not want. When Vivendi, for example, announced a $12 billion loss last Wednesday for the first half of the year, Standard & Poor's, a unit of the McGraw-Hill Companies, cut the company's long-term corporate rating to junk and said further downgrades were possible. By day's end, all the bad news pushed Vivendi's shares down by an additional 25 percent.
Whatever the merits of the Vivendi decision, some investors say that actions by the ratings agencies are often too precipitous. "All of a sudden the markets are hitting air pockets, where bonds can drop 20, 30, 40 points right away," said Glenn Reynolds, chief executive at CreditSights, an independent research firm in New York. "A company can go from triple B to single B to default in short order. It comes from all the regulatory scrutiny they were under."
Christopher Mahoney, chairman of the credit policy committee at Moody's Investors Service, defends his agency's actions, saying that most ratings downgrades have been limited to two troubled sectors -- telecommunications and merchant energy. Besides, he said, his firm had a responsibility "to call them as we see them," regardless of the consequences.
"We are not like a regulator who says soothing things at times of difficulty," Mr. Mahoney said. "We obviously bend over backwards not to be irresponsible. But that does not mean we can forebear. We are obligated to be honest about what our opinions are, even if our opinions may be disruptive. We don't seek to be disruptive, and we appreciate that the corporate bond market is currently in turmoil."
In some cases, Moody's has rated a company, only to downgrade it as little as two months later. "Some issuers have gone a long way in a short time frame," Mr. Mahoney said. "Obviously, we don't like that."
Mr. Reynolds, of CreditSights, though, said swift downgrades could set off a "nightmare scenario" in which the downgrades become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Should a downgrade occur at a time when a company is refinancing debt, its borrowing costs would suddenly rise, further impairing its financial health. Banks, too, can change the terms of credit lines, demanding that downgraded companies pledge more assets or sell assets, potentially jeopardizing a company's ability to regain financial stability.
Whether because of economic conditions or agency aggressiveness, rating downgrades dominate the market. In the first quarter of the year, Moody's downgraded 159 companies, with $312 billion in debt, and upgraded only 34 companies, with $24.3 billion in debt. In the second quarter, Moody's downgraded 172 companies, representing $332.7 billion of debt, compared with upgrades of 35 companies, holding $49.7 billion in debt.
July brought no relief. Moody's downgraded 38 investment-grade companies, with $57 billion in debt outstanding, compared with upgrading 13 investment-grade companies, with $38 billion in debt. 
Some say the agencies are not being too harsh and are only playing catch up. Still, they acknowledge that the contrast between the approaches, as well as the sheer magnitude of downgrades, has caused market shock. 
"Like a lot of players, the agencies bought into the new economy too much, and they gave companies too much the benefit of the doubt," said William Cunningham, director of credit strategy at J. P. Morgan Chase. "Now they have reacted aggressively and are probably where they should be. Still, it is a shock to the system, and it has caused a lot of pain."
Merrill Lynch, in a study of ratings changes in high-yield securities, found that downgrades as a percentage of total ratings changes were running at 78 percent -- at the high end of the range of 36 to 84 percent in the period from 1986 to the present. 
But the study also found that the bulk of downgrades in all periods could be explained by overall economic conditions. Only about 18 percent of the change is attributable to other factors, according to Merrill, including inconsistencies in ratings as the agencies become more strict or more lenient in their analyses. 
"Just because a company has been downgraded, there are people who love to believe it is the result of some irrational rampage by a rating agency," said Martin Fridson, chief high-yield strategist at Merrill. "You never hear anyone say they deserve to be downgraded. People who criticize the ratings agencies are preposterous, illogical and wrong."

Weaker Dollar Has Yet to Spur a Boom in Exports

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
The nation's trade deficit has narrowed slightly from record highs, the Commerce Department said yesterday, but the falling value of the dollar has yet to spur a boom in exports that could jump-start the sputtering economic recovery.
 The trade deficit fell to $37.2 billion in June from $37.8 billion in May, thanks to a fourth consecutive month of rising exports, according to government data. Exports of capital goods -- including machines, engines, semiconductors and telecommunications equipment -- rose, but imports rose as well, led by consumer goods like pharmaceuticals, toys and sporting goods. 
 With the dollar having lost about 12 percent of its value against the euro and the yen since February, many politicians, most recently Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill, have cheerily forecast a more drastic shift in trade favoring exports over imports. A weaker dollar makes it cheaper for foreign countries to import American goods and more costly for Americans to buy foreign-made goods. 
Instead, "what we have so far is not really enough to bring about a robust recovery," said Frank Vargo, vice president for international economic affairs at the National Association of Manufacturers.
One reason lies in the vicissitudes of economic statistics: when adjusted for inflation and judged against the currencies of the United States' biggest trading partners, the dollar has fallen only about 7 percent. Judged against all trading partners, it has dropped only 3 percent.
The dollar settled at 118.69 yen in New York yesterday, up from 118.57 yen on Monday, while the euro traded at 97.89 cents, up from 97.62 cents. In February, the dollar traded around 134 yen, and the euro was trading below 88 cents.
Even for companies sending goods and services to or from the countries that use the euro and Japan, however, adjustments to the dollar's decline could be slow or slight.
"A lot of businesses have locked-in contracts," said Charles Engel, a professor of economics at the University of Wisconsin. Because prices and quantities of imports and exports are fixed in advance, it may take months or even years for companies to react to the dollar's downward drift.
Over short periods of a few months, import prices -- the costs of bringing foreign goods to the United States border -- reflect only one quarter of exchange-rate changes, according to recent research by Linda S. Goldberg, a vice president at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and Jose Manuel Campa of IESE Business School in Madrid. Moreover, Ms. Goldberg said in an interview, retailers might not pass changes in import prices on to consumers in their entirety.
Some companies may choose to vary prices but not quantities to maintain market share. "We will certainly not import less," said Bette Kahn, a spokeswoman for Crate and Barrel, the Chicago-based chain of home furnishing stores run by Euromarket Designs Inc. "We will have to negotiate harder with suppliers all over the world. Prices will go up, but in our 40 years of doing business in Europe and Asia, we have seen lots of fluctuations in the dollar's exchange rate, and we have always been able to work through it."
Yet small changes in quantities now, especially for imports, could herald big changes in the future.
Mr. Vargo posed the example of a company with a long-term contract setting the quantity of its imports. When the dollar loses value, he explained, "it takes more dollars to pay for your contract in foreign currency terms." Though the quantity of imports stays fixed, "the value of your imports looks like it has risen."
But once the contract expires, he said, "then the imports start to go down, and the trade balance at that point will start to improve rapidly."
Mr. Vargo estimated that the adjustment process could take 18 to 24 months, though it might be shortened by the increasingly electronic nature of global trade. "If the dollar continues to depreciate," he said, "then we will see a huge drop in the trade deficit."
Responses to exchange-rate changes have also diminished because of hedging behavior. Trading derivatives to minimize exchange-rate risk has insulated many multinational companies based in the United States from fluctuations in the dollar.
"Certainly, the Fortune 500 are aware of these strategies," said Perry Parker, a managing director at Deutsche Bank who heads foreign exchange trading for North America. "They might make a decision not to hedge, but I think that's rare."
Having assets spread across the globe also acts as an automatic hedge against exchange-rate changes. Archer Daniels Midland, the agricultural exporter, holds roughly 40 percent of its assets overseas, estimated Dwight E. Grimestat, the company's vice president for investor relations. All of those assets, Mr. Grimestat said, "are carried in local currencies."
"If it's carried in local currency," he said, "and the dollar is weakened, then our assets just went up on the balance sheet."
In addition to changes in the trade balance, economists usually look for currency declines to be associated with upward pressure on prices and a shrinking flow of overseas capital.
The economy's sluggishness seems to have quelled the first danger, at least. "There's no evidence that investors see an inflationary threat," said Kermit L. Schoenholtz, chief economist of Salomon Smith Barney. In that respect, he added, "the retreat of the dollar is a gradual and benign one."
Yet foreign investment in the United States does appear to have suffered. Subtracting capital sent abroad from the United States, the net inflow into the country fell 83 percent, or $16.4 billion, in the first quarter compared with figures in the period a year earlier. Switzerland alone invested $11.1 billion in the United States in the first quarter of 2001; in the first quarter of this year, it withdrew $154 million worth of capital.
Mr. Schoenholtz said he viewed the dollar's decline as a signal of these retreating capital flows. The business climate in the United States, crippled by accounting scandals and faltering profits, makes investment in American securities less attractive. With less demand for American securities comes less demand for dollars with which to buy them, and the currency loses value.

Judge Orders Drug Company To Alter Ads

BYLINE:  By MELODY PETERSEN 

 BODY:
A federal judge has ordered the pharmaceuticals company GlaxoSmithKline to stop saying in its advertisements for Paxil, a top-selling antidepressant, that the drug is "nonhabit-forming."
 The decision, which was issued Friday by Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer of the United States District Court in Los Angeles but lawyers only talked about this week, was one of the first significant rulings on prescription drug advertising. It has caused the Food and Drug Administration, which regulates drug advertising, to file papers with the court, asking it to reconsider. 
 The agency said it had reviewed the Paxil ads and had agreed that the drug company could make the "nonhabit-forming" claim. The agency's lawyers said they were concerned that the decision, which was based in part on California law, could lead to a situation where there could be different requirements for drug advertising in each of the 50 states. 
In issuing the order, which takes effect Sept. 1, Judge Pfaelzer granted a request made by lawyers representing patients who said they suffered severe nausea and myriad other problems when they tried to stop taking the drug. The lawsuit, which seeks class-action status, contends that GlaxoSmithKline did not warn patients of problems that could arise if they stopped taking Paxil.
Karen A. Barth, a Los Angeles lawyer who helped file a lawsuit against the company last August, said that patients, doctors and other health care providers had filed thousands of reports with the F.D.A. describing patients' reactions after they tried to stop taking Paxil.
One patient, Dolores Phillips, an environmental lobbyist from Princeton, N.J., said she tried for three years to stop taking Paxil. Each time she reduced the dosage, Ms. Phillips said, she suffered from severe nausea, sleeplessness and tremors in her arms and legs. She said the nausea became so bad she was forced to go to a hospital emergency room.
"It was just an awful experience," Ms. Phillips said. "No one should have to go through it. These drugs are being prescribed as if they are antacids and they're not."
Ms. Phillips says she was able to stop taking Paxil by switching to another antidepressant. She hopes to stop taking that drug eventually.
With the help of an aggressive television and print ad campaign, Paxil was the second-best-selling antidepressant last year, with sales of $2.2 billion, according to IMS Health, a consulting firm. The best-selling antidepressant was Zoloft from Pfizer.
GlaxoSmithKline said yesterday that it planned to appeal Judge Pfaelzer's decision.
David Stout, president of the company's pharmaceutical business in the United States, said in a statement that GlaxoSmithKline "strongly stands behind the safety and efficacy of Paxil."
"Physician organizations like the American Psychiatric Association have stated that antidepressants are not habit-forming," Mr. Stout said.
In December, GlaxoSmithKline added a precaution to Paxil's label urging patients not to abruptly stop taking the drug. The precaution said that if the dose could not be gradually reduced without the patient's experiencing withdrawal symptoms, the patient might have to return to taking the original dose.
Both the company and the F.D.A. say that many drugs cause problems when patients stop taking them, but that does not mean that a drug should be considered addictive or habit-forming.
"These problems are just the body's adjustment when you stop taking medicines," a spokeswoman for GlaxoSmithKline, Mary Anne Rhyne, said. "It takes more than that to be addictive."
For example, Ms. Rhyne said, Paxil does not cause patients to crave the drug or feel they need a higher dose.
Dr. Stuart Shipko, a psychiatrist in Pasadena, Calif., who was an expert witness for the patients' lawyers, said that all the newer antidepressants appeared to cause problems for many patients who tried to stop taking them, but that Paxil appeared to cause the most severe effects.
"The commercials make it seem as if this pill is a life enhancer," Dr. Shipko said. But then people try to stop taking it, he said, and they cannot stop. "The longer you take it, the harder it is to stop," he said.

HEADLINE: U.N. Official, In Beijing, Tells of Worry Over Rights 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Aug. 20 

 BODY:
Nearing the end of her five-year tenure, Mary Robinson, the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, expressed her concern this week over "new and worsening problems" involving rights abuses in China -- and suggested that they were unlikely to be fully resolved until China underwent significant political reform.
 "There has been progress, but there's an awful long way to go," said Mrs. Robinson, making her last visit to Beijing before stepping down next month. 
 Still, in meetings on Monday and today, Ms. Robinson offered praise for what she called the increasing willingness of Chinese officials to discuss and collaborate on human rights issues. 
Since she took office, Mrs. Robinson has worked hard to coax China to engage on the issue, with some success. In September 2000, for example, the United Nations and China signed an agreement of "technical cooperation," which has led to training seminars on rights awareness for policeman, judges and lawyers.
She has also pressed the government to release or revisit the sentences of numerous prisoners jailed for political reasons without fair trial.
But she acknowledged that economic turmoil in China as well as the international campaign to fight terrorism had in many ways imperiled human rights in China and even led to slippage in some areas.
She pointed to increased repression of China's Muslim population since Sept. 11. She added that the economic dislocation of China's workers caused by the restructuring of its planned economy had led to an erosion of workers' rights.
"These are new areas and are going to raise new human rights issues in the years and months to come, and I believe that China must open up politically to solve them," she said.
As on previous visits, Ms. Robinson presented to the Ministry of Justice a list of legal cases that troubled her. Some of the names had appeared on previous lists, including Xu Wenli, a longstanding dissident who is in jail for his association with the China Democracy Party, and Rebiya Kadeer, a Muslim businesswoman whose activist husband lives in political exile in the United States. "Some have been raised repeatedly, and it has been disappointing that there has not been more action," she said.
But the list also touched on her new concerns: for the first time it included ordinary Chinese workers -- specifically three who have been in prison since last spring for helping to organize worker protests in northeastern China. Also mentioned was Zhang Jianzhong, a defense lawyer imprisoned in May who has not been accorded many of the legal protections required by Chinese law. 
Mrs. Robinson called it "ironic" that China's most prominent defense lawyer had been denied his rights at a time when the country had been making great efforts to improve its legal system. One of the main purposes of Ms. Robinson's visit to Beijing was to address a joint seminar of foreign and Chinese experts on how China could build better rights protections into its laws. 
She praised officials at the Chinese Ministry of Justice for their efforts in human rights, but suggested she has gotten less cooperation from other branches of government, particularly the Chinese police and security sectors. For example, she noted that her requests to meet with officials from the powerful Ministry of Public Security had been persistently rebuffed.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Bans Lawn Watering As a Lingering Drought Worsens 

BYLINE:  By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: NEWARK, Aug. 20 

 BODY:
Revising New Jersey's drought restrictions for the third time in five months, the state's top environmental official today banned lawn watering and car washing statewide and directed businesses using large amounts of water to submit plans to cut use by as much as 50 percent.
 And in a further signal that the state's drought is worsening, Bradley M. Campbell, the commissioner of the Department of Environmental Conservation, asked businesses using 100,000 or more gallons of water a day to provide a separate economic impact analysis of a 20 percent cut in their use. 
 Speaking at a Trenton news conference, Mr. Campbell said that 7 of the last 12 months were the driest in the state's history and that August was shaping up as the driest August ever. He said that with water supplies declining and use still high despite conservation measures, the state had to act "immediately and aggressively" to avert a crisis. 
Last week, Mr. Campbell repeated his call for strict enforcement of the department's restrictions. Violations can lead to a disorderly persons charge that carries penalties of up to $1,000 in fines and six months in jail.
While the new rules ban lawn watering, the restrictions allow for shrubs, trees and planting beds to be watered on an odd-even system. House addresses with even numbers may water only on even-numbered days of the month; those with odd-numbered addresses can water only on odd-numbered days of the month. Commercial car washes that recycle water can still operate. Power washing of buildings is prohibited for all but professional operators.
"Things are getting really serious, if you hadn't noticed," said James Sinclair, an environmental specialist with the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, which represents the companies that are among the state's largest water users. "And the possibility of even further restrictions is a problem because the last thing you want to do at a time like this is adversely affect the economy or employment."
Mr. Sinclair said that banning car washing and lawn watering was one thing. "But when you restrict a plant to one shift, that is another," he said.
In March, the state imposed a drought emergency, which among other things restricted lawn watering to odd/even days and cut water allocations to operations such as golf courses by as much as 50 percent. Restaurants were restricted from providing water to patrons unless they asked. After rains came in late spring, the department in June eased some of the restrictions.
But as water demand has since increased and rainfall has diminished, Mr. Campbell reinstituted and ratcheted up the restrictions.
He said the plans he was requesting from businesses would help his agency write future restrictions in ways that would have the least adverse impact. Mr. Sinclair said that such plans would allow him to tailor restrictions by region and on a case-by-case basis.

HEADLINE: Fears That Lending to Brazil May Dry Up 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 20 

 BODY:
Nearly two weeks after the Bush administration threw its support behind a $30 billion loan to rescue the Brazilian government from financial collapse, American officials and the International Monetary Fund are worried about whether big international banks will keep lending to Brazilian private industry.
 The president of Brazil's central bank, Arminio Fraga, is flying to New York for a meeting next week with some of the country's biggest creditors, including Citigroup, J. P. Morgan Chase and FleetBoston. 
 American and European banks have all been scaling back their lending to Brazilian exporters and manufacturers in the last six months. Most are refusing to comment on their willingness to jump back into that market on the heels of the fund's big loan deal. 
Administration officials estimate that Brazilian companies have about $10 billion in loans and credit lines that come due before the end of this year. Much of that credit is being used to finance exports, which in turn are crucial in getting Brazil's overall financial condition back in balance.
Today, Brazil's central bank said it would try to fill the gap by providing up to $2 billion in loans to the country's exporters. But that strategy will force the government to use up precious foreign exchange reserves, which in turn will weaken its ability to defend the beleaguered currency, the real, from another downward spiral.
Michael Mussa, who was chief economist at the International Monetary Fund until earlier this year, said Brazil faced about a 50-50 chance of coming unraveled all over again.
"The numbers don't say the situation is necessarily hopeless," Mr. Mussa said today. "But if creditors think the risk is great enough that it is better to get out than to stay in, that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy."
All of this poses a difficult ideological and political problem for the Bush administration, whose top officials had until recently vowed to avoid the big international rescues that became fairly common under President Bill Clinton.
Faced with the possibility of a financial meltdown in Latin America's biggest economy, the administration reversed itself earlier this month and supported the huge loan package for Brazil.
But senior administration officials say they remain adamantly opposed to pressing private banks to follow up with more generous lending to private borrowers. That, they said, should be a decision the banks make for themselves.
Still, administration officials are concerned. John B. Taylor, under secretary of the Treasury for international affairs, is in almost daily contact with Brazilian leaders and is quietly supporting the Brazilians' efforts to talk up their case with the international banks.
Administration officials are closely monitoring the markets' shaky confidence in Brazil. Foreign investors reacted to the original loan package by fleeing from the Brazilian market and driving down the value of the real.
The real and Brazilian government bonds have recovered significantly in the last few days, but the foreign anxiety is still widespread: Brazilian government bonds are trading today for less than 57 cents on the dollar, which means that investors are betting that chances of a default are still almost even.
In what may be an additional effort to bolster confidence, some Bush administration officials speculated about the possibility that the United States Export-Import Bank might be able to provide additional credit to Brazilian buyers.
Bo Ollison, a spokesman for the Export-Import Bank, denied reports by some news agencies that the bank was considering a program modeled after one created for South Korea during the Asian financial crisis. But Mr. Ollison said the federally financed bank was more than ready to approve new loans for Brazilian companies that want financing to import American products.
"We are open to all sectors for Brazil," Mr. Ollison said today. "If there is a creditworthy buyer and a U.S. exporter, we'll do it."

HEADLINE: Bush Team Is Campaigning to Muster Opposition in Africa to Mugabe's Rule 

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 20 

 BODY:
The Bush administration said today that it was working to foster opposition to President Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe, calling his rule illegitimate and irrational.
 Using some of the administration's strongest language yet to condemn the government in Zimbabwe, senior state department officials said Mr. Mugabe won re-election in March through fraud and coercion and has since helped spread starvation in southern Africa through misguided policies. 
 Though they stopped short of calling for a change of government, the officials said the United States was working with human rights activists, labor unions and pro-democracy groups in Zimbabwe, as well as other southern African governments, to isolate the Mugabe government and encourage democratic opposition. 
"The political status quo is unacceptable, because the elections were fraudulent," Walter Kansteiner, the assistant secretary of state for African affairs, told reporters at the State Department today. 
"So we're working with others, other countries in the region as well as throughout the world, on how we can in fact, together, encourage the body politic of Zimbabwe to in fact go forward and correct that situation."
The administration's strong remarks came as the Mugabe government began evicting hundreds of white farmers from their property as part of a land redistribution plan. Since the government started enforcing the new law last week, about 200 farmers have been arrested for refusing to comply.
Southern Africa is experiencing its worst drought and food shortages in a decade, and a senior state department official said it was irrational for Mr. Mugabe to evict white farmers when Zimbabwe needed their skills more than ever.
"It is madness to arrest commercial farmers in the middle of a drought when they could grow food to save people from starvation," said Andrew S. Natsios, administrator of the United States Agency for International Development.
Mr. Natsios said the Mugabe government was not actually giving the property to landless blacks, but using it to reward loyal military officers and political cronies.
Mr. Natsios also announced today that the United States has pledged an additional 190,000 metric tons of food assistance to southern Africa, where more than 12 million people in six countries are expected to suffer food shortages by the end of the year. The United States has already delivered or pledged to provide 310,000 metric tons of food, mainly corn, to the region.
Zimbabwe is expected to account for half of those hungry people. Malawi, Zambia, Mozambique, Lesotho and Swaziland are also experiencing severe food shortages. The United Nations is trying to collect $611 million in food and other aid to stave off famine in those countries.
Administration officials also said Mr. Mugabe had worsened food shortages in his country by maintaining currency exchange policies that have made it unprofitable to export food to Zimbabwe.
"The problem is, the most severely affected country is the country that is being the least cooperative," Mr. Natsios said. 
The administration's criticism of Mr. Mugabe comes as Secretary of State Colin L. Powell is preparing to lead a delegation of senior administration officials to South Africa for an international conference on sustainable development. 
Senior administration officials said Secretary Powell was likely to discuss Zimbabwe in talks with European and African leaders during that trip. Mr. Mugabe is also expected to attend the conference, which will be held in Johannesburg starting next week.
Since the March elections, which were marred by violence and allegations of fraud, the Commonwealth has voted to suspend Zimbabwe, and several western nations have imposed travel or financial sanctions on senior officials in the government.
But African nations have been less willing to criticize, much less impose sanctions on, Zimbabwe. Administration officials said today that they were encouraging some of Zimbabwe's neighbors to pressure Mr. Mugabe to avoid an authoritarian crackdown on his people and to speak out publicly against his policies. 
"We don't expect these guys to impose travel sanctions or economic sanctions on Mugabe," one senior administration official said. "But most of Mugabe's neighbors are keenly aware of the problem he poses for the region."
The senior official said the United States was also providing advice, training and in some cases financial support to labor unions, human rights groups, election monitors and journalists to encourage them to demand democratic rights and free elections. 
"Zimbabwe once was to many people a model of democracy and economic success," the official said. "Mugabe has systematically attacked most democratic institutions. But there's enough of a system still in place for the Zimbabwe people to deal with this." 
Some independent analysts say they are not so sure, asserting that opposition groups have been weakened since the elections while Mr. Mugabe remains popular with the military and the landless poor. 
"Mugabe runs on an anticolonial platform," said Michael O'Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. "So U.S. criticism may actually help him, not hurt him."

HEADLINE: Campaigning About A-Plants, But Without Actual Power 

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 16 

 BODY:
Both candidates for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in New York are trolling for votes by saying that they want the Indian Point nuclear reactors closed. The Republican incumbent, in a shift, refuses to rule out the idea.
 But there is a problem. The 48-year-old federal law under which nuclear power is regulated provides no role for governors in nuclear safety. States, the Supreme Court has ruled, can make decisions about whether, and where, a reactor or other type of power plant can be built, but not about reactor safety. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has sole jurisdiction. 
 "The decisions from the courts have been very clear, that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has the authority to regulate the plants in terms of their safety of operations," said the commission's chairman, Richard A. Meserve, in an interview. "That is not an authority that is exercised by the states. The states do not have any power to order a shutdown of a plant for safety reasons." 
For a time, there was an exception for one plant, Indian Point 3. The reason was that New York State owned it, along with the James A. FitzPatrick reactor near Scriba, N.Y.
But the state sold them to Entergy two years ago, for $967 million. Now, according to experts, the state has little leverage.
"You don't regulate nuclear safety if you're a state," said Jay E. Silberg, a lawyer at Shaw Pittman, which does extensive work for reactor operators. The firm represented the New York Power Authority in the sale of Indian Point 3, and also does work for Entergy.
Still, since Sept. 11, anxiety has grown in Westchester over the Indian Point nuclear reactors' vulnerability to terrorist attack, and with the suburbs usually a critical battleground in the general election, all of the candidates have sought to address concerns about the plants' safety. How much of their rhetoric is meaningless posturing?
Andrew M. Cuomo in particular has sought to make it an issue. Mr. Cuomo lives in Westchester, and his brother-in-law is Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whose environmental organization, Riverkeeper, has recently made closing Indian Point a focus.
Riverkeeper has been broadcasting radio ads critical of the plant and of George E. Pataki, the two-term governor who is seeking re-election in November. Perhaps in response, Mr. Pataki has hired a former director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to review the emergency plans, promising a report by December.
The two Democratic gubernatorial campaigns concede that a governor alone cannot shut the plant, but they argue that a governor could exert enough pressure through public calls and legal maneuvers to make it all but impossible for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to ignore their wishes.
Both camps say that had Mr. Pataki not signed off on federally required evacuation plans for the plants in January, it would have set in motion a process that could have led to the closing of the plants.
Steven Greenberg, a spokesman for H. Carl McCall, the state comptroller who is Mr. Cuomo's principal opponent, said Mr. McCall would use public pressure to "begin the decommissioning process."
Peter Ragone, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, said that Governor Pataki had failed to act when he had the chance. "The governor had an opportunity to show leadership on the issue and decline to certify the emergency plans surrounding Indian Point," Mr. Ragone said. "He could have lobbied the relevant federal agencies -- FEMA and N.R.C. -- to shut down the plant unless and until it could be made safe."
But this is not clear to the N.R.C. itself. Mr. Meserve, asked if a state could force a plant to shut by boycotting the emergency planning, pointed to the case of the Seabrook plant in the New Hampshire town of the same name. The state of Massachusetts, with several towns inside the 10-mile emergency planning zone, refused to approve emergency plans. The plant got its license anyway.
Mr. Meserve, who was not then on the five-member commission, said the license was granted "in recognition of the reality that if adverse circumstances were to arise, it would be irresponsible of the state not to have an emergency plan," and that while it might boycott drills, it would not boycott response to a radiation leak.
That was in 1990. The previous year, the N.R.C. said it would license the Shoreham nuclear plant, on Long Island, even though New York State said evacuation was not possible.
What, then, could a governor do? Even Alex Mathiessen, the executive director of Riverkeeper, acknowledged that a governor's main tool would be the "bully pulpit" of the office.
Shoreham is, though, a precedent of sorts. Mario M. Cuomo, Andrew's father, who was governor at the time, reached an agreement with the Long Island Lighting Company to shut it.
But there are crucial differences, experts say. One is that Lilco was a utility regulated by New York State. Consolidated Edison, which built and operated Indian Point 2 until it sold it to Entergy, was such a company. But Entergy, based in Jackson, Miss., is not regulated by the state.
"The changes in ownership make a difference," said Peter Bradford, who was chairman of the Public Service Commission when the Shoreham deal was struck.
"Certainly the shutting down of Shoreham came about in no small part because Lilco was a state-regulated utility," Mr. Bradford said "The order that really led to the shutdown was one the public service commission issued, saying Lilco should demonstrate that it was going to have adequate power supplies for the forthcoming two or three summers, or make clear-cut provisions for an alternative approach that would allow them to get by without Shoreham.
"It's hard to see a situation where the Public Service Commission or the state could issue a similar order to Entergy today," he said.
New York could try to buy the reactors, Mr. Bradford said, but might have to pay more than Entergy paid for them, since the company would probably estimate their value according to anticipated profits, which most experts believe makes them worth more than the company paid. (Calculating the price paid is difficult; Unit 3 was sold as part of a package with FitzPatrick, and both plants were sold in a deal that included a contract for the sellers to buy back the electric power for several years.)
Calculating the value would require estimating the future price of electricity on the wholesale market, and estimating how reliably the reactors will run, and for how long.
At Synapse Energy, a consulting firm in Boston that recently produced two reports on the reactors for plant opponents, David Schlissel, a nuclear expert, said, "If I could foresee the future like that, I'd go to Las Vegas."
Entergy would argue that Indian Point's value to it is as part of a system, with some economies of scale, said Larry Gottlieb, a spokesman for the company. Mr. Gottlieb is based in White Plains at an office that the company established to oversee the two Indian Point plants, FitzPatrick, and Pilgrim, in Plymouth, Mass., and it just closed on Vermont Yankee, near the Massachusetts border. Some energy experts believe that the plants are highly profitable for Entergy.
The procedure for Shoreham was simpler, because that deal was made in the days when reactor owners were regulated utilities. In Shoreham's case, the state calculated the amount spent to build the plant, deducted what the public service commission might label an "imprudent" investment, and made an offer to Lilco.
A state could try to use its power of eminent domain to take a plant. But Mr. Silberg, the industry lawyer, said that a plant owner could argue in court that doing so for safety reasons was illegal. A state could use eminent domain for urban redevelopment or building a highway or some similar purpose, he said, but the proper procedure for safety concerns would be to petition the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Asia: South Korea: Growth Forecast Stands 

BYLINE:  By Don Kirk (NYT) 

 BODY:
 Jeon Yun Churl, South Korea's finance minister, said that he would not lower his forecast of 6 percent economic growth this year, even though "instability in the United States and South America" could have an effect. His confidence was reflected on the Korea Stock Exchange, which rose nearly 3 percent, to 736.70, its highest level in nearly a month. Among the gainers were Samsung Electronics and Hynix Semiconductor, buoyed by reports that memory chips might recover from their current downturn. Daewoo Electronics, meanwhile, said it would liquidate noncore assets, including its audio and computer monitor units, and merge with a subsidiary, Daewoo Electric Motor Industries.

HEADLINE: Robert Dedman, 76, Dallas Philanthropist 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: DALLAS, Aug. 20 

 BODY:
Robert H. Dedman Sr., a philanthropist and business leader, died today at his home in Dallas. He was 76.
 The cause has not been determined, but Mr. 
Dedman was in poor health and apparently suffered a heart attack, the Dallas police said. 
 Mr. Dedman, the founder and chairman of ClubCorp International Inc., made the Forbes list of America's 400 wealthiest individuals, with a net worth of $1.2 billion. ClubCorp, which was founded in 1957, owns or operates more than 210 golf courses, country clubs, private business clubs and resorts worldwide.
Mr. Dedman and his wife, Nancy, and their children have given more than $77 million to Southern Methodist University, where two schools bear the Dedman name. He also served two terms as a member and chairman of the Texas State Highway and Public Transportation Commission.
He was an advocate for education and earned four degrees in economics and engineering and two in law. 
In a speech in 2000 promoting his book "King of Clubs," Mr. Dedman said success depended on attitude. "You have to have the right attitude," he said. "We must enjoy life and get all that we can out of it because it may be the only chance we get."
In addition to his wife, Mr. Dedman is survived by a daughter, Patricia Dedman Dietz; a son, Robert H. Jr.; and five grandchildren.

HEADLINE: REGIONAL MARKET: Manhattan; 
Price Swings 'Enormous' In Deals for Office Space

BYLINE:  By SANA SIWOLOP 

 BODY:
As many seekers of Manhattan office space have discovered lately, this is a good time for deal making. With demand still weak in many parts of the borough, landlords are continuing to offer everything from a few months of free rent to double commissions for brokers.
 Lately, some real estate brokers say they have noticed landlords even offering rents at signing that are sharply discounted from the asking rents that typically open most negotiations. 
 At other times when the Manhattan office economy has been less than robust, the difference between asking rents and signing rents was typically 5 to 10 percent, brokers say. But some brokers also think that, publicly at least, Manhattan landlords used to adjust their asking rents at a faster clip than they have in the current slowdown. 
Now, the adjustments are starting to come in, says David N. Lebenstein, director of commercial sales and leasing at Time Equities, a real estate services company based in Manhattan. Yet even when landlords are not publicly willing to lower their asking prices, many are willing to come down from those prices rapidly, frequently in the range of 25 to 30 percent, and sometimes as much as 60 percent for property that is being sublet, particularly in Lower Manhattan, according to Mr. Lebenstein and Suzanne Sunshine, a sales associate at his company.
"The swings are enormous," said Mr. Lebenstein, who represents tenants. "If a building had been asking $35 to $40 a square feet, in many cases people will sort of whisper to you that for the right deal they'll do $30 a square foot, or in some cases, $25 a square foot."
Both Mr. Lebenstein and Ms. Sunshine cautioned that the biggest discounting is appearing primarily for office space in Lower Manhattan and in areas like Chelsea and Clinton, rather than in Midtown. The discounting also seems to depend, they add, on factors including the quality of the building, its vacancy rate and the financial strength of its landlord. Both brokers say that they began noticing the drops sometime around May and that they are seeing more and more flexibility, by both landlords and their representatives. 
Ms. Sunshine cited one recent sublet deal in which she was able to obtain 1,350 square feet of space with "gorgeous" views at 15 East 26th Street for two fund-raising groups that work for Senator Hillary Clinton. Ms. Sunshine said her tenants got the space at a price that was about 25 percent less than the asking price of $38 a square foot.
As another example, Ms. Sunshine cited the 1,500 square feet of prime space with "great" views that she was able to obtain for a consulting group at the landmark Woolworth Building two weeks ago, at a price of $27.50 a square foot. A year ago, she said, asking rents in the Woolworth building were in the range of $40 a square foot.
David L. Levy, a principal at Adams & Company, another real estate services firm in Manhattan, has also noticed that some Manhattan office landlords are offering signing rents that are as much as 25 percent below asking rents. But he says the discounting is being offered primarily to tenants who have strong business and credit records, and by landlords who also have strong financial positions, perhaps because they are not carrying large mortgages on those properties. 
He cited one potential tenant, an architecture firm, that his company, which represents both landlords and tenants, is now considering for 6,400 square feet of loft space with multiple windows at a building that Adams owns at 48 West 37th Street. According to Mr. Levy, the asking rent for the space had been $27 a square foot, but he is now considering a deal at $18 a square foot. "If it were a marginal tenant, I wouldn't even be thinking about this," he said.
James S. Meiskin, the president of Plymouth Partners, a brokerage firm that represents many large companies looking for space in Manhattan, agrees that there is a gap between signing and asking rents, but he says the difference is in the area of 8 to 12 percent. He suspects that tenants who are looking for smaller blocks of Manhattan office space, because of the greater availability, are probably being offered larger discounts than those looking for larger spaces. "I think rents will probably level off soon because the economy is picking up," he said. 
Mr. Lebenstein and Ms. Sunshine, however, are not so sure. "I'm advising tenants to wait until after Labor Day," Mr. Lebenstein said, "and not rush into deals -- I think prices are going to come down even more." 
Ms. Sunshine agreed. The overall market, she said, is in transition and "landlords are still asking rents from a year ago." But, she added, "at some point that will all have to be adjusted."

HEADLINE: Americans Are Taking Care Not to Offend Afghan Hosts 

BYLINE:  By IAN FISHER 

DATELINE: SUROBI, Afghanistan, Aug. 20 

 BODY:
The conversation at a little restaurant here began politely, as many do in Afghanistan when the subject is the Americans. A shopkeeper said he had never seen an American soldier but felt they had come to help. A cook said the Americans' presence was all that kept the country quiet. 
 Then a village leader, known as Khairullah, spoke up. "Afghanistan has no need for foreign troops," he said firmly. "We need national unity. We need friendship between ethnic groups. We don't need an invasion." 
 It is rare for Afghans to talk so openly against the plainest new reality in their lives: the several thousand American soldiers who patrol Afghanistan on the ground and in the air; raid remote villages where Taliban and Qaeda forces are suspected of hiding; act as bodyguards for the nation's new president, Hamid Karzai; hand out money and jobs; dig wells; and distribute school supplies by the truckload. 
Mr. Khairullah does seem an exception -- most Afghans, in scores of recent interviews, said they still supported the United States military as a guarantor of stability and economic growth.
But his words represent an undercurrent of doubt that 10 months of American operations here have not much diminished. And, as the nature of the conflict changes, the doubt could deepen. That doubt surged last month after an American military operation in Oruzgan Province that left about 50 civilians at a wedding party dead. Afterward, most Afghans seemed willing to forgive, if not forget, in an attitude one Western diplomat soberly summed up as "a fund of good will and a suspension of judgment." 
The Pentagon is well aware of the fragility of the relationship between Afghans and the American military, and how a change of heart could jeopardize the United States mission here. 
"As long as they are suspending judgment, that's great," said Col. Roger King, a spokesman for the American military at the Bagram base, north of the capital, Kabul. "Once they make a decision, and if it comes down on the wrong side, it's not going to be fun to be here."
While Colonel King denied there had been any change in policy, Afghan officials, diplomats and local leaders in contact with American troops said that the Pentagon had recently acted to forestall an erosion of support. Since the disaster in Oruzgan, the Americans have been taking particular precautions to avoid civilian casualties. 
"There is more communication, but whether it's enough is another question," said Omar Samad, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry. "There is more coordination, and there is definitely more awareness on the part of the coalition forces to be more careful and not disregard the goodwill of the Afghans."
One Western diplomat in the capital, Kabul, said: "They are trying to be more careful. And why is that? It's not because they are humanitarians. It is in their narrow interest to do so."
The issue of how the American military conducts itself will become increasingly important as the nature of the war shifts from active battles and bombings to smaller-scale operations, and as the new Afghan government attempts to consolidate its own rule. "Before, the rules were rules of their own making," the diplomat said. "But as the situation changes, you can't be a cowboy anymore."
Indeed, the Pentagon's battle strategy has shifted in recent weeks from the initial reliance on its overwhelming advantage in air power to putting more troops on the ground. It is a change, however, that Colonel King attributed less to concerns about civilian casualties than to the need to hunt smaller, more active, enemy groups. 
The relationship between Afghans and Americans is a complicated one, with mutual need and suspicion on both sides. It revolves around the basic question of whether American troops will stay too long and wear our their welcome, or leave too soon and allow Afghanistan to fall back into chaos.
Afghans take deep pride in their independence, at having not only defeated but humiliated two invading imperial powers, the British and the Russians. Because of this, they chafe not only at blunders like the Oruzgan deaths but at other perceived chinks in their sovereignty, like the American soldiers who now guard President Karzai. 
While most support the idea of American troops hunting down members of Al Qaeda and the Taliban, the reality of having aircraft and special forces teams combing their villages, especially along the border of Pakistan, can be deeply disturbing. 
Still, most Afghans admit that they need the American troops. The new government is counting on them not only to battle the remaining Taliban and Qaeda forces but also to act as a check on meddling neighbors, especially Pakistan, which had supported the Taliban. 
"We don't have any options except to have the Americans here," said Muhammad Kazem Ahang, a prominent professor and member of the loya jirga, the traditional governing body that chose Mr. Karzai as president. But, he warned, "It must be done sensitively."
In Kabul, where streets bustle and reconstruction moves forward, largely with the flow of foreign money, it is hard to find a bad word against the Americans.
"We are so happy we can't even fit in our clothes," said Zakera Tarin Azimi, 38, a clerk in a government ministry. "If things are calm and peaceful, we want the Americans here forever. If they left, I am sure the fighting would start over again."
But even Ms. Azimi complained that she still had not received all her back pay -- and paying government salaries is one promise made by the international community in its package for reconstruction. The Afghan government has complained that aid money has trickled in slowly, and that broken promises could erode support. 
The level of suspicion among Afghans is no surprise to the American military, from top commanders to soldiers on the ground.
"Look how much they have been through," said Sgt. First Class Larry Moore, 39, a reservist from Huntsville, Ala., as his Land Cruiser bumped along the damaged roads and past destroyed houses north of Bagram. "Would you just stand at ease and be trustful? It's hard to do."
In his work with civil affairs teams, Sergeant Moore has spoken to more Afghans than have most Americans here. The teams, whose work is aimed at retaining the support of Afghans, have spent several million dollars on local projects, including schools, health clinics and wells. 
"I think we've won the hearts and minds, not of everyone but a lot of people," he said, as his team drove to donate school supplies to an orphanage.
"They thought we were here for revenge," he said. "But we weren't here for revenge. We were here for justice. And once they saw that, it made a difference."
Sergeant Moore says he does worry that the relationship might change, and dangerously, if the American mission here expands in a way that American officials have so far avoided. 
One larger concern is that American forces may begin to be drawn into factional fighting, especially if there is a threat to Mr. Karzai's shaky central government by regional warlords. "If we do that, then we've chosen sides, and then we're going to have problems," he said. --------------------

Bomb Found in Kabul
(By The New York Times), KABUL, Afghanistan, Aug. 20 -- In the latest indication that violent opponents of the American-backed transitional government are operating in the capital, Afghan security officials said two youths left a powerful bomb today in a crowded bazaar on Kabul's airport road, not far from the American Embassy. The bomb was removed before it exploded, averting what the officials said could have been "a lot of destruction and killing."
The police said a shopkeeper alerted a security patrol, which found that the bomb contained more than 10 pounds of explosives. Soldiers of the international peacekeeping force helped disarm the device.

HEADLINE: Silence of Clintons Speaks Loudly for McCall 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

 BODY:
For more than a year, the most famous Democrats in New York State have remained studiously neutral in the fight for their party's nomination for governor. 
 But now, advisers say, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and former President Bill Clinton have concluded that a victory by H. Carl McCall would help Mrs. Clinton's political prospects and those of New York Democrats as a whole. 
 Even so, the Clintons are torn about the personal and political choices the race presents, the advisers say. Andrew M. Cuomo is a former Clinton administration cabinet officer who has claimed the Clinton mantle in this race. But Mr. McCall, the state comptroller, was one of the earliest backers of Mrs. Clinton's 2000 campaign, and is both the darling of the party leadership and favorite of black voters, the base of Mrs. Clinton's support. 
The Clintons have made it clear that they will remain publicly neutral through the primary on Sept. 10. But people close to them say they have decided, like many Democratic strategists, that Mr. McCall would probably fare better than Mr. Cuomo against Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican, in the general election on Nov. 5. They think that Mr. McCall, who is black, would be better able to hold key voting blocs, like blacks and union members, in the Democratic column.
A few recent moves hint at a growing closeness between the Clinton and McCall camps. One of Mrs. Clinton's top fund-raisers, Vivian Santora, left her political committee, Hillpac, to go to work for Mr. McCall's campaign, with the senator's blessings. Eric Eve, once a top political aide in the Clinton White House and the 2000 Gore campaign, also recently joined the McCall campaign.
"Look, they feel a great loyalty to both these guys, and I think she, in particular, will be out there doing whatever she can, no matter who wins the primary," said a political strategist close to the Clintons. "But there are advantages for McCall."
Through a spokesperson yesterday, Mrs. Clinton's office said: "As I've said, I generally don't endorse in contested primaries, and I am remaining neutral. I think we have two worthy candidates, and I look forward to campaigning vigorously with whomever wins the primary.'
Mr. Clinton also issued a statement through a spokesman, saying: "I have stayed out of this primary and will continue to do so. I like and admire both Carl McCall and Andrew Cuomo, and feel indebted to both of them, for different reasons."
Josh Isay, Mr. Cuomo's campaign manager, said, "We know that the Clintons want the strongest candidate to win the Democratic primary, and we believe firmly that the strongest candidate is Andrew Cuomo."
A primary victory by Mr. McCall would give Mrs. Clinton a chance to campaign aggressively for him through November, mending fences with black officials who are annoyed that she has not endorsed him in the primary. In addition, Mr. Clinton is "very excited by the idea of a black governor of New York," said a prominent Democratic elected official who has discussed the race with him.
Democrats fear that a Cuomo victory in the primary could alienate minority voters and prompt them to abandon the party in November -- a repeat of the racial divisions last year that cost the Democrats the New York City mayoral contest.
"She doesn't need any of that rubbing off on her -- she knows that," said an adviser to Mrs. Clinton. "She would work hard for either one, but she's better off if it's Carl, and so's the party."
Mr. Cuomo, who served as the federal secretary of housing and urban development under Mr. Clinton, is explicitly running on the Clinton legacy. He frequently links himself to the former president's economic record, has featured Mr. Clinton in some of his campaign ads and says that he learned at the feet of the master what it means to be a "new Democrat," not a traditional liberal.
No matter who wins the Democratic primary, he will need all the help he can get. Mr. Pataki leads both Democrats in the polls by wide margins, he has seized many of the issues and allies that normally belong to the Democrats, and has raised far more money than Mr. McCall and Mr. Cuomo combined.
President Clinton has always been enormously popular with New Yorkers, even at the lowest moments of his presidency, and he and Mrs. Clinton are a powerful fund-raising draw. Both campaigns are pinning much of their hopes for November on the Clintons' involvement.
"They are absolutely crucial to us, no question, and that's true no matter who wins the primary," said a top Cuomo strategist.
Mrs. Clinton has said she will do whatever she can to help the party's nominee, but Mr. Clinton's role is less certain. He has stayed largely out of public involvement in politics since leaving office 19 months ago, and has kept an especially low profile in New York, to allow his wife to establish her own political identity.
But he is in high demand this fall and plans an active schedule of campaigning and raising money for Democratic candidates around the country, making for a tough decision about how much time and effort to devote to New York.
"He is itching to get into this race, stumping, fund-raising, you name it," said a Democratic strategist who is close to the Clintons. "The biggest questions are his schedule and whether Hillary objects to him overshadowing her in her backyard."
A close adviser to one candidate said, "Given his schedule, if he gives us four big events, maybe a fly-around, a couple of fund-raisers, I would say that's pretty good."
Mr. McCall's camp has been far more aggressive than Mr. Cuomo's about lobbying for the Clintons' aid. Some of Mr. McCall's backers even openly criticized Mrs. Clinton for remaining neutral after Senator Charles E. Schumer endorsed Mr. McCall last month.
Mrs. Clinton's advisers say they are not concerned about her standing with black voters -- "she polls better with blacks than McCall does," one said -- but rather see the McCall campaign as an opportunity for her to shore up relations with black leaders and the party apparatus.
Black officials have told Mr. Clinton bluntly that the best way to prevent a lasting rift between them and Senator Clinton would be for the Clintons to work hard on Mr. McCall's behalf after the primary, according to several top Democratic officials. Some tell of hearing the former president getting an earful on the topic a few weeks ago from Representative Charles E. Rangel, who was one of Mr. Clinton's most vocal defenders during his impeachment, and was one of the first people to promote Mrs. Clinton as a Senate candidate before she, herself, even acknowledged the possibility.
Mr. Rangel, an ardent McCall supporter and Cuomo critic, disputed that account. "If anything, he gave me an earful," he said. "He really wants to get out there. He believes Carl is the superior candidate."
Advisers to the Clintons and Mr. McCall say they have had what one called "a number of informal conversations about what the roles will be." Among the topics has been the possibility of the former president making a television ad for Mr. McCall.
The Cuomo camp has had similar talks with Mrs. Clinton's aides, but not with Mr. Clinton's. "It's been sort of taken for granted," a Cuomo aide said.
So far, the only concrete plan for the Clintons' involvement in the fall campaign is for them to be among the headliners of a major fund-raiser to be held by the state Democratic Party on Oct. 23.

HEADLINE: AT HOME WITH: BETSY CARTER; 
Rosy Glasses After a Sea Of Setbacks

BYLINE:  By ALEX WITCHEL 

 BODY:
IT may have looked like only a hole in the ceiling surrounded by soaked plaster, but Betsy Carter knows a metaphor when she sees one. "It's too good to pass up, isn't it?" she asked, eyeing it ruefully. 
 It certainly is. Just as Ms. Carter, the veteran editor and writer, was ready to talk about her new memoir, "Nothing to Fall Back On: The Life and Times of a Perpetual Optimist" (Hyperion), which documents a successful career in journalism -- and a spectacular triumph over a run of bad luck that makes Job look as if he lived at Club Med -- her home, her sanctuary, has sprung a leak. 
 It was possible, of course, for Ms. Carter to have simply kept the door to her bedroom closed, so that the hole, the plaster damage, the problem, remained unseen. But the slumber-party-confidential editing style that made New York Woman such a smash in the 1980's and has always been her hallmark would not allow it. And after nine years at Newsweek, six years at Esquire, four years at New Woman and one year at Harper's Bazaar, she has learned the art of full disclosure. 
Continuing the apartment tour, she passed her brightly lighted work space where she wrote her memoir (she is now the editor of My Generation, the baby boomer magazine she created for AARP in 2000). On the wall was the framed cover from the first New York Woman in 1986. "Our Marvelous, Maddening Lives!" it exclaimed. 
Perhaps no one's life has been more maddening than Ms. Carter's. From 1983 to 1992, she endured the results of a taxi accident that shattered her jaw and teeth and required more than a year of reconstructive surgery; a hysterectomy at age 38; being left by her husband of 17 years, who revealed he was gay; the destruction of her weekend home by fire; and six months after New York Woman folded in 1992, being told she had breast cancer -- on her birthday. Ms. Carter may be the only person in New York whose therapist recommended an exorcism. Seriously. 
"I wrote the book to come to terms with this whole string of bad luck," Ms. Carter said, sitting in her living room. "In real life I can just tell funny stories and dismiss it, but writing this didn't let me. And to get to the point where I could write anything else, I had to get rid of this first." 
Ms. Carter, 57, has lived in this Central Park West apartment since 1994 with her second husband, Gary Hoenig, executive editor of ESPN Magazine. (They married in 1991 despite a first date that, consistent with her luck at the time, culminated in a bicycle accident that left him with a bruised spleen.) Their Tibetan terrier, Lucy, lay on the couch next to Ms. Carter, who sat between windows with lush views of the park.
"Light is crucial to me, and colors," she said. "I first saw this apartment when I was just off chemo and thought, 'This is a healthy place; I'll be O.K. here.' After I got cancer I thought about my life a different way. I was always a very reactive person, but I decided I have to do what makes me happy, not do what I was supposed to do. It was a present to myself, to cut out the stress. Things became toxic and nontoxic. The world split itself up that way -- people, jobs. And I kept away from the toxic. There was nothing ambivalent about it."
With its floor-to-ceiling bookshelves and bursts of color (she painted the coffee table raspberry), the apartment is decidedly cheerful, much like Ms. Carter herself. 
Imperfectly cast as a victim of tragedies, she has no taste for drama or dejection. With her long legs, corkscrew curls and dazzling smile, she still looks like a cheerleader. (Dentists should schedule field trips to see these teeth.) 
Indeed, for all the calamities documented in her book, she still manages to keep the tone light; a lifetime of writing upbeat cover lines seems to have inoculated her against succumbing to despair.
Well, almost. "I once said to a doctor that if I could I'd get seat belts for my couch," she said, smiling wryly. "I always see the cataclysmic thing that can happen now, which I never did before. And I'm impossible in a car. I'm constantly seeing accidents that never happen." 
Ms. Carter was born in New York City and lived in Washington Heights until she was 10, when her parents moved the family, which included her older sister, Miriam, to Miami. 
Her father, Rudy Cohn, was frequently unemployed, and her mother, Norma, supported the family as a comptroller in a printing plant. They had both escaped from Germany before the war, and Ms. Carter remembers them as staying resolutely outside the mainstream of American popular culture. 
All she ever wanted to be was an all-American girl, Ms. Carter writes, and she embraced that can-do spirit, though her taste in men was problematic early on. After growing up with a father whose idea of a game was to chase her, catch her, then cover her mouth and nose until she couldn't breathe, it's easy to see why. 
One early relationship was so destructive that her mother stepped in to end it. So when the handsome, polite Malcolm Carter, an expert gardener who made a mean pot roast, came along in 1968, she thought she had triumphed.
"Believe me, I didn't know," Ms. Carter said. "Call me dense, but he was very devoted to me and really took care of me. Certainly I needed a father. Every now and then Gary will say, 'I have something to tell you' and I say, 'Please don't tell me you're gay.' " She laughed. 
"Malcolm and I are still friends, actually. Even when I had cancer and we were divorced, he came over and cooked dinner for me. He was a kindly person, like a parent, really. And you don't want to give up on a parent." 
Mr. Carter, who now lives in Washington, said by phone: "I still respect, admire and cherish Betsy in the ways I always did, and I feel very close to her. It's inconceivable to me that we would not have remained friends. She is a very generous person in every possible way." 
Talk of pot roast sent Ms. Carter to the kitchen to get lunch. Throughout the apartment are signs of her whimsy. An avid swimmer, she tiled the kitchen floor in turquoise so it resembles a pool, and a friend painted a flamingo on one of the cabinets, a reminder of Ms. Carter's Florida youth. 
In the front hallway stands a wooden statue of a frog shaded by a lily pond leaf, a lighthearted purchase after a considerable settlement from her taxi accident that allowed her to buy her parents a condominium and install a pool at her weekend house. Although the reconstruction lasted more than a year, she returned to work one week after her initial surgery to make a presentation to Esquire advertisers for the magazine's new fashion section. Her determination paid off; she was promoted to executive editor.
"Going out and being normal is my way of coping," Ms. Carter said staunchly, carrying plates of wrap sandwiches to the dining room table. "No one was ever sick in my family, and if you were, my mother was impatient: you had about two days. The idea of people being sorry for me, I can't bear it." 
Helen Rogan, who has been friends with Ms. Carter since 1984 and was executive editor at New York Woman, as she is at My Generation, said: "Her energy is a source of great bewilderment, really. Her psychic energy and the physical as well. God forbid you should spend a weekend with her -- biking, hiking, tennis, swimming. 
"Her resilience is incredible. Maybe it came from her mother, that immigrant thing of having to make it. She's a very practical person who knows how to say enough is enough, change focus and get on with it."
When Ms. Carter's house in Red Hook, N.Y., burned down five months after Mr. Carter left her (neither was there at the time), she devised a method to cope with that, too. 
"I visualized every item in the house, saying goodbye to it," she said. "It went on for about a year. I lost so much stuff, and now I have all this new stuff I've picked. Everything is like a touchstone. Being here is the safest place in the world to me."
Except for that hole in the ceiling. But when the workmen returned, Ms. Carter ignored them, concentrating instead on the bedroom wall streaked with an array of colors for what she hopes will be the imminent paint job. They are hues of sunshine, from pale yellow to deep orange. For a while, the working title of her book was "Sunshine Girl," a partial reference to Florida, the Sunshine State.
"It was never meant to be a bummer of a book," Ms. Carter said. "For all the bad things that happened, nice things happened too." Indeed, she is now working on a novel, her cancer is in remission and Mr. Hoenig hasn't fallen off his bike in years. 
Does she ever think about the story she contributed to The New York Times for Metropolitan Diary in 1981? She had been sitting in a cab (pre-accident), stuck in traffic, and an elderly man with a white beard opened the door, climbed in next to her and announced that he needed to go only one block. When he got out, he dropped a dollar on her lap and said: "I was sent to you by God. Think about it." 
Does she? Given everything that followed, what could that possibly have meant?
She laughed and her teeth sparkled: "Maybe it could have been worse."

HEADLINE: Nestle Reports 79% Increase In Profit During the First Half 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH OLSON 

DATELINE: GENEVA, Aug. 21 

 BODY:
Nestle, the world's largest food company, reported a 79 percent increase in profit today for the first half of 2002. Gains from asset sales and a partial spin-off of an eye-care products subsidiary offset charges for the falling value of some slower-growing businesses.
 The company, best known to American consumers for its chocolate and for Nescafe coffee, recorded a profit of 5.66 billion Swiss francs ($3.76 billion) in the period. An initial public offering of part of the Alcon eye-care unit and the sale of an aromas business yielded $3 billion. 
 Sales rose 7.2 percent from the first half of last year to 44.2 billion Swiss francs ($29.5 billion), fortified by Nestle's acquisition of the Ralston Purina dog food business in the United States, where Nestle has been expanding aggressively. This month, it agreed to acquire Chef America, which makes the top-selling Hot Pockets snack line, and Dreyer's Grand ice cream.
The company said it expected healthy full-year sales and profits, particularly in its pet care, water and ice cream operations. Nestle attributed its resilience in tough economic conditions to its broad array of products and geographic range.
"Nestle has delivered a good performance by any measure in the first half of 2002, demonstrating its capacity for growth and performance improvement even in a difficult global environment," Peter Brabeck, the chief executive, said.
Nestle took charges totaling $1.1 billion to write down the value of some units, notably Spillers pet food, which it acquired in 1998. Spillers has suffered as European consumers have switched to dry pet food.
Nestle's registered shares rose 3 percent in Swiss trading to close at 335 Swiss francs ($223.62) a share.
Mr. Brabeck told analysts that Nestle would introduce another cost-cutting program over the next three years, reducing the number of production plants, selling units and upgrading production. An earlier plan completed last year reduced costs by $2.7 billion.
Nestle executives declined to comment on whether the company would make a bid for Hershey Foods, the American chocolate maker, which has been put up for sale by the charitable trust that controls it.

HEADLINE: Not All Airlines Are Caught in the Global Downturn 

BYLINE:  By WAYNE ARNOLD 

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, Aug. 21 

 BODY:
As US Airways filed for bankruptcy protection and other industry giants announced cutbacks to cope with mounting losses this month, Singapore Airlines inaugurated a new service between Singapore and Las Vegas.
 Less than a year after the Sept. 11 attacks devastated an industry already racked by global recession, Singapore's flag carrier is prospering. It is not alone. In many Asian countries, airlines are benefiting from lower fuel costs, resilient tourist traffic and a strong recovery in cargo shipments. 
 "Relative to what is happening in the U.S. and Europe, Asia is a paradise for airlines," said Jean-Louis Morisot, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs here.
This month, Korean Air Lines said it had reversed a loss, posting a first-half profit of $163.9 million. Cathay Pacific of Hong Kong, which never slipped into the red, reported that first-half profit rose 6.8 percent, to $180.8 million. Singapore Airlines said in May that in its last fiscal year, ended March 31, it had net profit of $361.2 million; that was down 61 percent, largely on losses from foreign holdings, but well beyond analysts' expectations. Thai Airways said last week that net profit in the quarter ended June 30 more than quadrupled, to $82.4 million.
The relatively good airline news extends to Australia, where the country's largest carrier, Qantas Airways, has benefited from a commodity-driven boom -- as well as the collapse of Ansett, its main rival for the domestic market. Qantas announced this week that it would start a new airline, a low-cost service for leisure travelers, and said that net income rose 3 percent, to $233.8 million, in the year ended June 30, despite some continuing labor problems.
Such numbers are likely to look even better when compared with those of United States airlines, analysts say. They added, however, that the prospect of a further slowdown in the American economy, or, even worse, a double-dip American recession, could take a big toll on Asian carriers.
Another problem, particularly for the carriers with small or no domestic markets, is breaking into new markets elsewhere.
This year, though, Asian airlines have been getting a big boost from falling prices for jet fuel, typically the biggest expense for Asian airlines, said Amit Thakar, an analyst at SG Securities in Singapore. Lower global demand for jet fuel after Sept. 11 has left prices 10 percent lower than they were last year, and rising Asian currencies have made it cheaper still for the region's airlines to keep planes flying. Singapore Airlines alone will save $200 million on fuel this year, Mr. Thakar estimated.
The countries' stronger currencies -- and their growing economies -- have inspired a consumer-spending boom around Asia, including a recovery in leisure travel. Singapore, for example, expects more than a million visitors from China this year, double the number that came last year. Thailand is also expecting an increase, and Thai Airways and Singapore Airlines have both added flights to China to handle demand. Cathay has applied to resume flying to the mainland after a 12-year hiatus.
The tourism boom benefits some airlines more than others. Premium airlines like Singapore Airlines and Cathay rely more on their vaunted business class, a sector that analysts say has yet to rebound. Airlines have also been discounting fares, according to Mr. Morisot at Goldman, cutting the profitability of carrying passengers.
A more lucrative area of recovery has been in cargo traffic, an area in which American carriers have traditionally not been very strong. But Korean Air, Singapore Airlines and Cathay are among the world's top 10 cargo carriers. And Singapore Airlines carried 16.4 percent more freight in June than in the same month last year, as the American economic recovery gave rise to shipments of food, toys, textiles and electronics, analysts said.
Analysts worry that if America's recovery falters, such shipments would dry up, and eventually Asia's consumers would stay home, too. But just as the Asian airlines were well poised to take advantage of the economic recovery, analysts say, they are better prepared for any downturns.
Long coddled by government shareholders, protected markets and docile -- if any -- unions, many Asian airlines learned from the region's own financial crisis in 1997 and 1998 that they need to keep a lid on capacity and debt.
Singapore Airlines, for example, managed to become the world's sixth-largest international passenger carrier without borrowing. Late last year, it issued its first bonds, raising 900 million Singapore dollars, largely to establish a credit rating and leverage its huge cash position. After Sept. 11, it cut salaries 15 percent and has now restored them.
Still, with only four million people on its tiny home turf, Singapore Airlines relies on carrying passengers from Asia to Europe or North America.
Its efforts to crack new markets through acquisition are usually hamstrung by the fact that Singapore's government owns 55 percent of the flag carrier and regulators in other countries are reluctant to allow the sale of an airline to a an entity controlled by another government. 
What headway it has made has soured. For example, it held a 25 percent stake in Air New Zealand, but was rebuffed in its bid last year to buy Air New Zealand's Australian carrier, Ansett. It then watched as Ansett closed and Ansett's parent, Air New Zealand, lurched to the brink of ruin. A bailout by the New Zealand government reduced the Singapore Airlines stake to less than 6.5 percent, spurring a $152.6 million write-off. (Qantas is negotiating to buy into Air New Zealand; it has also announced plans for two stock issues to raise $432 million to use in upgrading its fleet and for other "potential investment opportunities.")
To gain access to the coveted trans-Atlantic market, Singapore Airlines paid $960 million in 1999 for a 49 percent stake in Virgin Atlantic of Britain, which is now losing money and detracting from Singapore Airlines' bottom line.
Finding a way to make money in new markets remains Singapore Airline's biggest challenge.

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES; 
For the Homeless, a Face Behind the Bureaucracy

BYLINE:  By ALAN FEUER 

 BODY:
CAROL DAVID finally went on vacation last week, heading south to Busch Gardens in Williamsburg, Va., even though she's not a major fan of funnel cakes and she tends to get a little dizzy on roller coasters. It wasn't her first choice, but there were four good reasons for taking the trip: her three daughters -- ages 7, 9 and 11 -- and her son, 5.
 Ms. David isn't much of an amusement park person. She's not a big vacationer either, mostly because she doesn't like to sit around. For the record, she is not a smoker, not a baseball fan, not rich, not shy, not lazy, not from the country, not a bad cook and she doesn't wear high heels. 
 "I prefer flats," she says, "because I'm always on the go."
She is, on the other hand, the director of the Emergency Assistance Unit in the Bronx, the city's intake center where homeless families can apply for shelter, which has become so crowded in recent weeks that three times as many people as the fire code allows wait there each day. 
She is 35, a frequent listener to the dance music on WWPR-FM, partial to Dunkin' Donuts corn muffins, the author of a children's book, stressed-out but easygoing and, perhaps most important, a former tenant of the Betances Houses, a public housing complex in the Mott Haven section of the Bronx, which is not too far from the intake center.
"Growing up where I grew up," she says, "I saw the projects. I saw low-income families. So when I deal with people in my job, I see my face on the other side."
Clearly, her job becomes more difficult when the issue of overcrowding at the center begins to ricochet between the mayor's office, the newspapers and the courts. Ms. David tries to deal with the homeless, not the hype. Is it the economy? The minimum wage? Is there enough low-income housing? She concedes she has more questions than answers. "I don't just take it on face value that people are there. I ask why they're there."
Don't assume Ms. David's early life was a South Bronx tableau of knives and guns and drugs. It wasn't. Weekends meant trips to the New York Botanical Garden or prayers at the Greater Victory Baptist Church, and there was handball at St. Mary's Park and arts and crafts at the local community center where she was a monster on the Ping-Pong table. 
Mom stayed home and Dad drove a yellow cab at night, but he always stuck around for dinner. Sitting at the big kitchen table, he was at it every night with, "What did you do today?" and "What do you want to be?" 
At first, Ms. David wanted to be an artist. She attended Art and Design High School in Manhattan and went on to get a degree in illustration from the Fashion Institute of Technology in 1986. She eventually wrote a children's book -- still unpublished -- about a little boy in an African village whose mother is about to give birth. The boy runs around the village all day long, knowing a surprise is coming but not sure what it is. At the end of the day, the baby is born.
Spend five minutes with the woman and, one way or another, she ends up talking about families. "I had a strong family," she says. "And I know a lot of people didn't. But even if you're in a crisis, even if family things break down, you can still bring the family up again."
The origin of that idea: her father always talked about the commercial where the elderly lady trips in her house and falls. "I've fallen and I can't get up," she says. "No," her father always said. "If you fall, you do get up."
It's fairly good advice for a woman who eventually decided to go to Hunter College, get a master's degree in urban affairs and work with homeless families every day. By the time Ms. David deals with her clients, they are angry, tired and full of despair. They have nowhere to go and, often, no one to believe in. Her approach is to make them see that, as she explains, "There but for the grace of God go I."
"I make a point of dealing with the families, speaking to them face to face," she says. " 'Do you know I have four kids?' I'll say. 'I know what kids are like.' I'm a mother talking to another mother. Having kids and seeing kids in the facility, you understand what a mother needs."
WHAT a homeless mother needs most is a little time to herself, Ms. David says. "You have to have something for yourself. It's not only about your kids' needs, it's about your needs, too. And that isn't selfish, it's healthy. You don't want all that bottled-up anger and frustration spilling out on your kids."
Her little time to herself is dancing alone in her living room each morning shortly after she climbs from bed at 5:30 a.m. 
This is before she sets out her children's clothing, puts breakfast on the table, calls work to check on the day's events, drives the children to school or day camp, heads from her home in Harlem to the Bronx, greets her staff, inspects the restrooms, talks to clients, answers e-mail messages, gets a wheelchair for one family, gets a car service for another, calms down a frantic mother, hurries back home to cook baked ziti for dinner, picks up the children again and spends a little time with her companion, Bernard, a Port Authority policeman who almost died on Sept. 11.
After that, she dances again, alone in the living room. No flats, no high heels. Just her bare feet.

HEADLINE: 3 Fed Bank Chiefs Hint That Another Rate Cut Isn't Needed 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 21 

 BODY:
The presidents of three Federal Reserve regional banks said today in separate remarks that interest rates were low enough to keep consumers spending and fuel the economy's rebound, suggesting that Fed officials did not think that another cut in interest rates was needed to prevent growth from faltering.
 "The road to recovery is turning out to be bumpy," Michael H. Moskow, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said in a speech to business leaders in Appleton, Wis. "The Fed cannot, and should not try to smooth out every bump. Monetary policy simply is not capable of doing so." 
 Consumer spending has underpinned the economic rebound, and business investment may start to pick up later this year, said Mr. Moskow and the presidents of two other Federal Reserve banks, Anthony M. Santomero of Philadelphia and Robert T. Parry of San Francisco. 
That view does not contradict the Fed's decision last week to keep the overnight bank lending rate at 1.75 percent and to declare that the economy faces a greater risk from weak growth than from inflation. But it runs contrary to the views of some who expect Fed policy makers to lower interest rates before the end of the year to ensure that the economy does not slide back into recession. 
Rates are "quite stimulative" at current levels and will bolster growth, Mr. Parry told the Chamber of Commerce in Emeryville, Calif.
One expert, David Wyss, chief economist at Standard & Poor's, said he thought that today's remarks were probably "orchestrated to reduce expectations of a rate cut." Central bankers lowered the overnight rate 11 times last year to its current level, and have kept it there since December.
"The Fed's current monetary policy stance is appropriately supportive of the recovery process," Mr. Santomero told business leaders in Reading, Pa. 
Mr. Santomero is a voting member this year of the Fed's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee. Mr. Moskow and Mr. Parry take part in the Fed's deliberations but do not vote. Policy makers next meet on rates on Sept. 24. 
"I expect consumer spending to continue growing," Mr. Santomero said, "and supporting recovery on the business side." 
Consumer spending increased at a 1.9 percent pace in the second quarter, down from 3.1 percent in the first quarter. 
But the Fed officials also noted that the recovery could not be sustained without capital investment by business -- something that would eventually lead to higher employment. 
Signs already point to a pickup in business spending, Mr. Parry said. 
Mr. Santomero said he expected such spending to increase "as we move toward the end of the year." But for now, he said, the economy is not growing fast enough to reduce unemployment. "We need to get to the point," he said, "where firms are consistently adding over 100,000 jobs a month in order to see real improvement in the labor market. We need more than that to reduce the unemployment rate."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Buyers Muscle the Market, Sending Nasdaq Above 1,400

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Buying resumed yesterday on Wall Street, sending share prices moderately higher after a bout of profit taking ran its course. Technology was the biggest winner of the session, giving the Nasdaq composite index its first close above 1,400 in six weeks. 
 "The market is a little stretched, so you're going to see some backing and filling," said Steven Goldman, chief market strategist with Weeden & Company in Greenwich, Conn. "Today, after pulling back, you're seeing no signs of exhaustion." 
 The Nasdaq closed up 32.66 points, or 2.4 percent, at 1,409.25. The close was the Nasdaq's best since July 5, when it stood at 1,448.36; it was last above 1,400 on July 8.
Other major gauges were also higher. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 85.16 points, or 1 percent, to 8,957.23, after falling 118 points on Tuesday. The Dow has rebounded more than 1,200 points since hitting a low of 7,702.34 on July 23.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index advanced 11.93 points, or 1.3 percent, to 949.36. 
Investors have been generally upbeat after two weeks of gains. The absence of major negative news this week has also helped stocks. Despite the Tuesday decline, the big indexes show net gains so far for the week.
But analysts say stocks are still vulnerable to profit taking, particularly when companies start issuing third-quarter profit warnings later this month and in early September.
"We had a recent run-up in the market that was impressive," said Alan Ackerman, executive vice president at Fahnestock & Company. "A sustainable advance may take time to develop."
Technology received a lift from Internet Security Systems, which rose 73 cents, to $18.15, after an upgrade from the investment firm Raymond James. 
Despite forecasting a third-quarter loss, the Newport Corporation, the chip equipment maker, rose 79 cents, to $19.04, after saying it would lay off 225 to 275 employees.
Technology bellwethers were also strong. Microsoft increased $1.24, to $52.28, and Intel advanced 59 cents, to $19.56. 
The market also owed part of its advance to specialty retailers that posted earnings that were better than expected. The Gymboree Corporation, a maker of children's clothes, rose $1.45, to $16.35, and Talbots, the women's apparel retailer, climbed 89 cents, to $33.20. 
On the downside, RadioShack fell $4.74, or 16.4 percent, to $24.21, after lowering its third-quarter earnings and sales outlook. 
Stocks for investment firms were weak after a downgrade by Salomon Smith Barney. Lehman Brothers dropped $2.20, to $58.98, and Bear Stearns fell 33 cents, to $65.79. --------------------

Treasury Prices Drop
By Bloomberg News
Treasury prices fell yesterday as the presidents of three Federal Reserve banks expressed optimism that an economic recovery would strengthen, damping speculation that the Fed would cut interest rates.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note increased to 4.20 percent from 4.15 percent on Tuesday. The price, which moves in the opposite direction, dropped 13/32 , to 101 13/32 .
The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond rose to 5.01 percent from 4.97 percent. Its price dropped 24/32 , to 105 15/32.

HEADLINE: A Global City Rebuilt 

BYLINE:  By Paul Spencer Byard; Paul Spencer Byard is a principal of Platt Byard Dovell White Architects and director of the historic preservation program at Columbia's Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation.

 BODY:
The effort to replace the World Trade Center is in a crisis of inspiration. One possible reason is that no one has yet embraced how those colossal buildings represented New York City's unique position of power in the world.
 In an effort to restore this symbolism, we might look to the United Nations and other institutions of global governance. The United Nations is a crucial local institution making real progress in the world under exemplary recent leadership. We should ask what we could build for it downtown as a focus for worldwide efforts against global inequality, AIDS, genocide -- issues New Yorkers know and care about. Two troubled agencies of postwar global economics, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, in fact were supposed to be in New York City, beyond the influence of Washington politics. We should invite them back from Washington -- warts, demonstrations, leadership and all -- and give them a home and put them to work in the context of a cosmopolitan city wired differently into the globe. 
 We might even think further ahead, to some larger forum or think tank intended to keep capitalism truly productive and responsible, like the nascent initiatives of the World Social Forum or the global justice movement. They, too, could find a home at ground zero.
Rebuilding downtown is not simply a matter of replicating nice old streets and putting up medium-sized office buildings. Rebuilding downtown is about rebuilding New York as a seat of useful power for action in the world. This is the power Alexander Hamilton got for us more than 200 years ago when he negotiated the deal that made New York the nation's -- and then the world's -- financial capital. This was what the huge public investment in the World Trade Center 40 years ago was trying to preserve for downtown. And this was one crucial reason the terrorists bombed the World Trade Center: to bring home to everyone the terrible menace of accelerating global inequality.
We have spent almost the entire 40 years since the construction of the World Trade Center trying to dismantle the public capacity to address social needs, cultivating instead our capacity to live strictly for ourselves. This is a position we can no longer afford: New York has a horrible hole in the ground, and we have the need and the will to address it. We also have some ideas that respond to our uniqueness.
These are just the crudest of starts, obviously, toward re-acknowledging New York's place in the world economic order and rebuilding its potential to lead it. But it's this size and range of thinking -- wider thinking for the old, global New York -- that might now give our planning the lift it needs. Here we could begin to find a worthy, driving program for the powerful architecture we long for. And here we could find a proper memorial for the World Trade Center.

HEADLINE: Data Show Growing Trend Toward Permanent Layoffs 

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Permanent layoffs surged from 1999 through 2001, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported yesterday in releasing the results of a survey that is the government's most comprehensive assessment of how frequently workers are dismissed from their jobs.
 The 9.9 million people who lost their jobs in that three-year period represented an unusually high 7.8 percent of the nation's work force. The economy moved from boom in 1999 to recession in 2001, and half of the layoffs came in that last hard year, when the unemployment rate suddenly shot up. 
 Compounding the damage from the surge in layoffs, employers cut back on hiring. More than 800,000 job openings disappeared from May of last year to May of this year, a decline of nearly 19 percent, the bureau reported last month. 
"You can have a high job displacement rate in a dynamic economy when there are lots of job openings for people to go to," said Lawrence Katz, a Harvard University labor economist. "But now there is a lot of displacement with a low level of job openings," and that is hardship.
Even in 1999 and 2000, which were years of strong growth and unemployment rates at 25-year lows, permanent layoffs were sufficiently frequent and widespread to suggest to many economists that the practice had become entrenched in the American workplace in the best as well as the worst of times.
"These numbers show a relatively high level of job displacement even when the unemployment rate was very low," said Ryan Helwig, the economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics who wrote the latest job displacement report. It is based on a survey every two years of 60,000 households.
The new report confirmed trends that have been developing for more than a decade. Permanent layoffs, also known as downsizing, no longer dip as sharply in the expansion periods between recessions. In addition, their constant presence has generated job insecurity, many economists say. That insecurity, in turn, has damped wage demands.
In fending off pressure to increase interest rates in the late 1990's, for example, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, cited job insecurity as a reason the falling unemployment rate would not produce the inflationary wage pressures characteristic of tight labor markets in the 1970's and 1980's. His resistance to rate increases, in turn, helped to sustain the expansion. The low rates encouraged borrowing to finance spending.
Among the 9.9 million people who said in the latest survey, conducted in January, that they had lost a job in the previous three years, 64.4 percent were working again at the time of the survey, in most cases full time. An additional 22 percent were unemployed and seeking work, while 14 percent had dropped out of the labor force.
The 64.4 percent re-employment rate was significantly below the rate in the three previous surveys. It matched, in fact, the difficulty in landing another job during the early 1990's recession, when the unemployment rate rose above 7 percent. It is 5.9 percent now, up from 4.3 percent early last year.
Those who managed to land full-time jobs after having been laid off from 1999 through 2001 did so at a sacrifice. Their median weekly wage in their new job was $571, down from $609 in the lost jobs.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics instituted the job displacement survey in the early 1980's in response to political pressure as downsizing surged. The survey initially focused on workers who had been laid off after holding a job for at least three years. The bureau still gives a lot of attention to these "long tenured" workers. In the most recent three years, four million lost their jobs, or 40 percent of the total.
That is down from 45 percent in the mid-1990's and 50 percent in the early 1990's. This shift has occurred as downsizing has spread from blue-collar workers in manufacturing to white-collar workers in every industry, and well up into management ranks, becoming "much more egalitarian," as Mr. Katz put it.
Reflecting the spreading practice, the displacement rate of 7.8 percent in the latest three-year period was up from 6.1 percent from 1997 through 1999. These were the peak boom years. By comparison, during the peak years of the 1980's expansion -- 1987 through 1989 -- the displacement rate dipped to 5.5 percent.
The latest surveys, however, may understate the frequency of permanent layoffs in recent years, some economists say. When members of the 60,000 households report having lost a job, they are then asked if the loss was because the factory or company where they had worked had closed or moved, or whether their job was abolished, or whether there was insufficient work. If the answer is yes to any of these alternatives, the job loss becomes a permanent layoff.
But over the years, permanent layoffs have increasingly come in other guises. Employers often press workers into accepting early retirement packages that sweeten pensions in exchange for leaving their jobs. They have turned much more to the use of contract workers and temporary workers who come and go as companies need them, but are not considered laid off until the firm that sponsors them -- a temporary help agency, for example -- stops sending them out to new assignments. 
"These could be problematic areas," Thomas Nardone, the chief of labor force statistics at the bureau, acknowledged. "If we tried to account for them, I don't know how that would affect the numbers."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
When the economy hits a turnaround, conspiracy theories abound.

BYLINE:  By Alan B. Krueger 

 BODY:
"PREDICTION is very difficult," Niels Bohr once remarked, "especially about the future." Lately, predicting the economy's recent past has proved to be difficult, too. Actually, determining last quarter's or last year's growth in gross domestic product has always been difficult and subject to error and revisions. 
 The daunting task of computing G.D.P -- the total value of economic output -- for an ever-evolving $10 trillion economy falls on the Bureau of Economic Analysis, a nonpartisan agency in the Commerce Department. The bureau bases its estimates on information from a diverse set of sources, not all of which are instantly available. Final tallies of corporate profits, for example, are not available for three years. 
 To produce timely information, the bureau announces an "advance" G.D.P. estimate within a month of the end of each quarter. Missing components are extrapolated from recent trends. As more complete information becomes available, the estimate is revised. Every year, usually in July, the bureau updates the data for the preceding three years.
Last month, as part of its regular cycle, the bureau announced eye-catching revisions. Most strikingly, the economy began to slow more than previously realized in 2000, and was shrinking in the first half of 2001. 
Had this been known sooner, policy could well have been different. For example, the back end of the $1.4 trillion tax cut would have been much harder to justify if it was apparent that a contraction was cutting into the budget surplus.
Why does the bureau periodically rewrite history? Why not wait until the final estimates are available? This is like asking why people look at a weather forecast: why not just wait to see if it rains before planning a picnic? 
The preliminary estimates are imprecise, but they give an indication of where the economy stands. No one would want to wait three years to find out if growth was slowing.
Besides, the bureau has a reasonably good track record, especially compared with its counterparts in other countries.
Economists judge the accuracy of initial estimates by whether future revisions can be predicted from currently available information and whether the revisions tend to be positive or negative. On this score, revisions are "efficient," meaning they are hard to predict and not too far from zero on average -- even though the average quarterly revision is plus or minus 1.4 percentage points on an annual basis. By comparison, real growth rates have ranged from -3 percent to +10 percent the last two decades.
A careful study by Jon Faust, John Rogers and Jonathan Wright, three economists at the Federal Reserve Board, found that revisions to G.D.P. growth in the United States were the smallest in the Group of Seven (Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States). In addition, the direction and magnitude of revisions are harder to predict from available information like stock returns and interest rates in the United States than elsewhere. They also find that in the United States revisions tend to be no different in an election year. 
This record is even more impressive in view of the fact that, on average, the delay from the end of a quarter to when G.D.P. is announced is twice as long in the rest of the G-7 as in the United States. 
Still, early estimates are generally noisier around turning points -- times when a recession ends or begins -- because the extrapolations no longer provide good approximations.
Consequently, revisions that encompass turning points regularly expose the bureau to sniping and unfounded accusations of partisanship. The columnist Robert Novak, for example, accused the bureau's career professionals of "incompetence" and suggested they cooked the books under pressure from the Clinton administration to make 2000 look better than it was. Rush Limbaugh accused the bureau of lying. And Martin Hutchinson of U.P.I. questioned whether the bureau and Alan Greenspan, "heavily influenced by his liberal Democrat wife,"the NBC News correspondent Andrea Mitchell, engineered the statistics to give the illusion of a productivity miracle.
If they were not taken seriously by some people and amplified in the news media, these attacks would be amusing. Instead, they damage the credibility of statistical agencies and erode morale among their employees.
Had the bureau really cooked the books, why would it bother to correct them? And why would it deliberately understate the contraction early in 2001 if it was part of a left-wing Mitchell-Greenspan conspiracy?
Most telling, recent revisions are not out of line with history, especially around turning points. From 1978 to 2000, two-thirds of eventual revisions were from -1.1 to +2 percentage points. Revisions to growth the last three years are statistically consistent with this range, though some components are somewhat more variable than usual. The average absolute revision in this period to date is 1.4 points, right on the long-term average.
In the early 1990's the errors were running in the opposite direction as the economy was recovering from recession. The agency was accused of overstating growth to make the first Bush administration look good.
Rather than respond to politically motivated critiques, the bureau has worked on a plan to reduce the size of revisions by improving measurement of services and software, which account for more than half of recent revisions. But it is disappointing that the White House has not jumped to the agency's defense. A statement of support by someone on the administration's economic team would help shore up morale and maintain confidence in economic data. 
While Monday-morning quarterbacking is popular sport, it is always difficult to predict revisions to G.D.P. Clearly the Bush administration misjudged how the economy performed in 2001. In March, Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill said, "It seems quite clear now that our economy never suffered a recession."
Prediction is indeed difficult, but it is predictable that anyone who makes too much of noisy preliminary data or alleges a conspiracy without any basis is apt to look silly when the final results are tallied.

HEADLINE: In Shift, Program Is Turning Tenants Into Owners 

BYLINE:  By JODI WILGOREN 

DATELINE: MILWAUKEE, Aug. 16 

 BODY:
Barbara Jean Robinson calls it her "miracle house."
 The three-bedroom, vinyl-sided Colonial is in a neighborhood of daytime drug deals and nightly gunshots. Ms. Robinson, 49, is afraid to sit in the yard because of the squatters in the abandoned house next door and the mangy tomcats. But her living room has five windows, where she has twined strands of plastic leaves as makeshift valances, just how she likes them. 
 After a lifetime living in public housing and using federal Section 8 rent assistance vouchers, Ms. Robinson, who lives off Supplemental Security Income because of a disability, bought the house in December through a new program allowing low-income families to use government subsidies for mortgages instead of rent.
"Sometimes I have to ask myself every day, 'Is this really my house?' " she said as she mixed a cake for her daughter's 17th birthday. "I always told the Lord, "If I ever get a home, can I have a lot of windows?' I kept praying for a brick house, but I began to pray different. I said, "God, give me what I need, not what I want.' "
Ms. Robinson is one of 13 Section 8 recipients in Milwaukee, and about 500 nationwide, who have become first-time homeowners through the Department of Housing and Urban Development initiative over the last year. Approved in the late 1990's but just taking off in recent months, the program has been embraced by the Bush administration as a path to its goal of adding 5.5 million black and Hispanic homeowners by 2010.
It is a huge shift for Section 8, which was begun in 1974 to disperse poor families from public housing projects and which is now the nation's largest and most expensive housing program, with 1.8 million recipients and a $14 billion annual price. The home ownership option, which requires financial counseling and caps subsidies at 15 years -- except for elderly and disabled recipients -- could make Section 8 a steppingstone to the middle class.
"This is part of the real American dream," said Michael Liu, the assistant secretary at HUD who oversees the program. "The statistics show, the anecdotes show, that home ownership is really the major rung toward moving upward to higher economics and higher education in the United States. Here they are building up wealth, they are building up equity for the next generation."
But while local and federal officials, and the new homeowners, consider the program a win-win, analysts and those on both sides of the low-income housing issue say it reflects misplaced priorities. They question whether Section 8 recipients are stable and responsible enough to handle the unpredictable costs of owning a house, and whether there are affordable houses in most markets. The government's efforts, they say, would be better directed at providing incentives to developers to build more low-cost units.
"A bona fide member of the community is not somebody who has a lawn, but somebody who earned that lawn," said Ron Utt, senior research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington. "We should be asking, 'Why is this person financially dependent? How can we make them independent?' as opposed to, 'How can we give them something other people work pretty damn hard to get?' " 
Ron Ippolito, executive director of the Florida Housing Coalition, an advocacy group, said his years in the field had taught him that, "I hate to say it, but some people are not meant to own a home." Most Section 8 recipients, Mr. Ippolito said, "don't have that disposable income if something goes wrong."
Susan J. Popkin of the left-leaning Urban Institute in Washington said her research showed that recipients of rent aid were often families with "multiple problems," including poor credit histories and bad health. "They are not in the position to own a home; many of them are having difficulty paying rent," Ms. Popkin said. "I can't imagine anything more than a small percentage of households would be ready for this."
Only 100 of the 2,500 eligible local housing authorities have signed onto the home ownership program. Federal officials said it has been most popular in small and mid-sized cities like Burlington, Vt., and Nashville, which have had 33 closings each. It has also caught on in Lakewood, N.J., and Syracuse, as well as in Midwestern cities like Columbus, Ohio; Madison, Wis.; St. Louis and Minneapolis.
Here in Milwaukee, along with the 13 closings since December, seven Section 8 recipients have been pre-approved for mortgages after completing home ownership classes. An additional 559 of the 5,000 local Section 8 recipients have applied. 
Section 8 assistance is limited to families with incomes of less than 80 percent of the local area median, and in Milwaukee that percentage equals $53,760. The local housing authority said that the average income of recipients here was $10,700, with three-quarters earning less than $15,000 a year. Nationally, to qualify for the home ownership option, recipients must be working and earn at least $10,300 a year, or 2,000 hours at minimum wage (unless they are disabled).
Genell Whitelaw, 45, a custodian at Marquette University who has been receiving Section 8 for six years, has looked at four houses since her application was approved two months ago and planned to look at three more on Saturday night after her shift. She wants a place that does not need much work in a clean, quiet neighborhood because she hopes to open a home-based day care center.
"Not that I don't like what the system is doing for me, but I don't want to stay up under the system," said Ms. Whitelaw, who will get $190 a month from the government toward her mortgage. 
Though disabled people like Ms. Robinson, who suffers from chronic lymphodema, which causes painful swelling, can qualify for other grants, those who are working must pay at least a third of their 3 percent down payment. Wendy Van Dyke, who moved into a three-bedroom ranch-style house in April with her two children, said she used her income-tax refund to put $3,000 down on the $80,000 house. Ms. Van Dyke, 34, a clerical worker for the county government who previously applied for bankruptcy protection, pays $381 a month; the Section 8 voucher covers $376.
The squat house is smaller than the apartment she had rented, but Ms. Van Dyke said her children, 12-year-old LaCree and 9-year-old Jared, seemed happier in the new house, playing in a gaggle of neighbors until Ms. Van Dyke called for them at dusk from the back door.
In June, Ms. Van Dyke had a housewarming party, where the pastor of her church blessed the house. The archway between the kitchen and the living room is still festooned with more than a dozen cards of new-home congratulations.
"I was thinking maybe I should take them down," she said. "Then I thought, no, I'm not ready yet."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL; 
Coolly, Fehr Plays His Hand

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
In his 19 years as head of the baseball players' union, Donald Fehr has been called a lot of things, among them the most powerful figure in professional sports, the smartest person in baseball and the nation's most successful labor leader.
 But many fans are so angry about the union's many strikes that they call him something else: Public Enemy No. 1. If that description bothers Fehr, he doesn't show it. 
 Still sounding like the litigator he once was, Fehr says he has one overriding concern: doing the best job possible for his clients, namely the 1,200 players on Major League Baseball rosters. He says that if he concludes that going on strike is the best strategy to get the best deal for his clients, then that is what he will recommend to the players on Aug. 30, the strike deadline, and his recommendation, considering his unbroken record of success, carries a lot of weight. 
As he locks horns with management's negotiators before the strike deadline, Fehr, 54, an intensely earnest, focused man, suggests that it would be wrong for him to worry too much about what the fans think, although he says he is mindful of fans' concerns.
"If I were representing you in a lawsuit," he said this week during a break in the talks, "and I said, 'The public is really against us, and whether you have a really good case or a really bad case, we're not going to make decisions on that basis, we're going to decide what to do by taking a public opinion poll.' If that's how I acted, you'd properly find another lawyer."
But the last thing the players want is to find another leader. The players are plenty pleased with Fehr (pronounced FEAR) because the average baseball salary has soared to $2.3 million a year from $289,000 since 1983, when he became executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Association.
"I see a man that is extremely committed to helping the players," said the player representative for the Kansas City Royals, pitcher Jason Grimsley. "This has been his whole life, his whole career. He represents us better than anyone could."
In his job far longer than most of the owners have had their teams, Fehr has led the players through the 2-day strike of 1985, the 32-day lockout of 1990 and the 232-day strike of 1994-95. In each battle, he has not made a major concession and has instead repeatedly gotten the owners to back off their demands for far-reaching changes that would cut player salaries.
"He's very bright," said Fay Vincent, the former baseball commissioner. "He's probably superior to most of the people he deals with on the management side. That's a terrific advantage. I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that the union really controls baseball."

A Tough Negotiator
Vincent and others, however, say Fehr has an intractable nature that works against smooth negotiating. "Fehr sees things in terms of the union's being on the side of good and the owners' being on the side of evil," Vincent said. "To a large extent I agree with him, but he turns that into a moral position, and that sometimes makes it hard to reach a deal on economic matters."
Richard Ravitch, who was the owners' chief labor negotiator before and during the 1994-95 strike, also said Fehr's brusque personality made it hard to get a settlement.
"He is not an easy person to talk to," Ravitch said. "I spent the first year trying to develop a relationship with him. He's not a particularly friendly person. He was totally not an empathetic person."
Ravitch acknowledged Fehr's successes at the bargaining table, but added: "Do I think what he accomplished has been in the best interests of baseball? No. I think baseball is hurting more and more because of the competitive imbalance."
Even some of Fehr's allies criticize him as having an icy, humorless personality and lacking public relations skills. He compensates with strikingly articulate, analytical off-the-cuff presentations that are neatly divided into parts and subparts.
This week Fehr has trained his sights on the owners' proposal for a steep luxury tax on teams with high payrolls, like the New York Yankees. This, he said, when coupled with large-scale revenue sharing, would be tantamount to a salary cap. The luxury tax, the union believes, would discourage high-payroll teams from making high bids for players, while revenue sharing distributes money from wealthier teams to poorer ones.
"The players have never been opposed to greater revenue sharing," Fehr said. "We are opposed, however, to greater revenue sharing, especially when coupled with a luxury tax, if it is done in a way so that its very purpose or necessary effect or both is not really to enhance competitive balance, but to lower owner costs" by reducing the amount they pay in player salaries.
Fehr refused to handicap the odds of the strike. "I'm not either optimistic or pessimistic," he said. "When you do this long enough, you understand this is not like a baseball game, where you can be real optimistic if it's 7-1 in the sixth inning."
Fehr, who makes $1 million a year, keeps in close touch with players and their agents, traveling more than 70 days over the past year to meet with the 30 teams. Although the players heap praise on him for his negotiating successes, Fehr insists that the players call the shots and that he is just a paid adviser. But it is hard to sort out where his highly informed advice ends and the players' independent judgment begins.
"I have a pretty good idea of what they think the right thing to do is," Fehr said. "And I have a pretty good idea of what I think the right thing to do is, and the object is to reach a consensus that the overwhelming proportion of players, if not all of them, will feel comfortable with.
"My job is to make sure we end up with a serious position and proposals that the players believe are in their best interest and that they are prepared to support. The reason why -- and I mean this literally, not figuratively -- is that it doesn't matter at all, not at all, what I say at the bargaining table or elsewhere. The owners' only concern is how they think the players will act on what is said at the bargaining table."
Some accuse Fehr of false modesty, saying he plays down his role. "There is only the facade of player leadership in the union," said Charles P. O'Connor, who was the owners' chief labor negotiator in the late 1980's. "It's a union run by lawyers."
Still, O'Connor said Fehr deserved credit for holding the union together. "He is not a natural labor leader," O'Connor said. "He is a trial lawyer leading a union. He doesn't have the same relationship that most labor leaders do, who got their boots dirty in the ranks."

Part Yoda, Part Gompers
That doesn't seem to bother players. Many of them view Fehr as part Yoda, part Samuel Gompers: someone who speaks wisdom and aggressively pursues their interests.
"I've never seen the sense of humor that he has, but I do think he's brilliant," Texas Rangers shortstop Alex Rodriguez said. "He gives guys an awesome amount of confidence because of his intelligence. He's very dedicated, and you always feel he's in control."
In an interview at the union's headquarters on East 49th Street in Manhattan, Fehr displayed a litigator's fierceness and focused intelligence. His gaze was like a hawk's, intimidating, as if trying to look through his interlocutor. But his dress was surprisingly informal: no tie, blue jeans with a hole in the back left pocket, and gray New Balance running shoes.
Fehr, who has a wife and four children, insisted that he did not want a profile written about him. "I have no interest in personal aggrandizement," he said. "If no one noticed me, that would be fine."
But Fehr's talents were noticed when he was a young litigator in Kansas City, and that led to his climbing the union's ladder. He was born in Indiana, but reared outside Kansas City in Prairie Village, Kan., where his father ran a restaurant equipment company and his mother was a real estate agent. The most cited episode of his childhood is that he read the whole World Book Encyclopedia before turning 13.
As a teenager, he was a strong student and debater, but not a star athlete. He played Little League, but his career ended, he once said, "the first time somebody sent me a curveball." He went to Indiana University, received his law degree from the University of Missouri and then clerked for a federal judge in Kansas City.
In 1976, Fehr, then just 28, represented the players' union when it asked a federal judge to uphold a landmark arbitration decision involving Andy Messersmith, a ruling that established free agency and overturned the century-old reserve clause that bound players to their teams. Fehr, who was working for a law firm that represented the steelworkers' union, won the case even though Major League Baseball had chosen to file suit in Kansas City, confident that it was the best city to find a conservative judge who would overturn the arbitrator.
Marvin Miller, the union's founder and executive director, was so impressed by Fehr that he hired him in 1977 to replace the union's departing general counsel. Miller said he hired Fehr because of his "legal ability and his ability to think on his feet."
Fehr learned at Miller's feet during the 50-day strike of 1981, and in 1983 he took the helm of a union that was already called the nation's most successful.
"Marvin planted the garden, and Don has just maintained that garden in perfect condition," O'Connor said.
At times, Miller and Fehr talk once a month, other times twice a week. "When things get hot, we talk," Miller said. Fehr said, "It would be pretty foolish of me not to avail myself of him."
In the past, Miller occasionally criticized Fehr for making minor concessions, but over all he praises him. "His biggest accomplishment has to be maintaining the solidarity of a group that is so much more prosperous than when we started way back then," Miller said.
Some former negotiators say Fehr, who is now in the job longer than Miller was, feels pressure never to grant a major concession, partly because he and Miller together have such a long winning streak. Fehr says there is no such pressure, noting that he has made pragmatic compromises in the past, like agreeing to limited revenue sharing in 1996 so as to address problems with competitive balance.
"I don't think there's any great big winning streak," he said. "Talk like that is used mostly in pep rallies."
Fehr has never been known for warm relations with the owners. That stems partly from three arbitration decisions that found the owners guilty of collusion by not bidding for free agents. In 1990, the owners agreed to pay the players $280 million as compensation.

A Student of History
So far this year, Fehr has steered clear of lambasting the owners, worried that it could hurt negotiations. In past years, he accused the owners of exaggerating their financial woes to buttress their case for more revenue sharing.
"If you go back in history, you can never find a decade where the owners said they were making money," Fehr said. "It never happened." He added that Bowie Kuhn, the former commissioner, "said that if free agency came in, the American League would go out of business and the National League would be reduced to six teams."
Instead, Fehr noted, since free agency began a quarter-century ago, Major League Baseball revenue has soared to $3.6 billion from $180 million. In his view, higher revenue has been the main force driving salaries upward. 
The union's success in besting management has helped push up salaries and ticket prices. As a result, many fans are fuming about not just labor strife, but huge salaries like Rodriguez's $25 million a year.
"Even if you can say Fehr has lost the battle with the fans," said Andrew Zimbalist, a Smith College professor and baseball author who once consulted for the union, "he seems to repeatedly win the battle with the owners, and that's what he seems to care about."

HEADLINE: Cuomo Is Saving His Firepower for End of Race, Advisers Say 

BYLINE:  By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD 

 BODY:
Andrew M. Cuomo may have projected a calm, polite demeanor in last Sunday's debate. He may have appeared with his 7-year-old daughter, Cara, yesterday for a campaign event, smiling and caressing her as he berated the powers that be in Albany.
 But, his advisers say, do not leap to conclusions about a kinder, gentler Andrew. He is, they say, going forward with a strategy that will reserve firepower until the final 10 days of the race, when he plans to unleash ads and tougher talk aimed at State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, his opponent in the Democratic gubernatorial primary, and Gov. George E. Pataki. 
 Senior campaign officials and advisers have increasingly begun talking about their endgame, seeking to counter perceptions among party insiders that Mr. Cuomo's opponent has a large lead with only a few weeks before the Sept. 10 primary.
It is important, analysts say, for the Cuomo camp to rebut the notion that he has fallen far behind, lest he lose voters and potential donors.
The Cuomo camp contends that voters will not pay attention to the race until the final week or 10 days before the primary. By then, they plan to broadcast a slew of ads questioning Mr. McCall's record, including what they consider his poor performance as president of the New York City school board.
They say thatdrawing attention to what they consider deficiencies in Mr. McCall's job performance is fair game.
Cuomo advisers are eager to counter any notion that Mr. Cuomo is hopelessly behind, fed in part by a Quinnipiac College poll released last week that surveyed people who said they were likely to vote in the primary and showed Mr. McCall with a 16-point lead. A number of private polls conducted by other candidates and consultants also show Mr. McCall leading, but by slimmer margins.
Mr. Cuomo's advisers say the Quinnipiac poll was conducted when many people were on vacation or were not paying attention to the race.
"Anybody who says the race is over is doing wishful thinking," said Mark Penn, Mr. Cuomo's pollster.
Cuomo supporters describe polling in Democratic gubernatorial primaries as notoriously off base, noting that Mayor Ed Koch was leading former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo by more than 20 points in some polls a few weeks before his defeat in the 1982 primary. "There are a lot of undecided people," said John Marino, a former state Democratic Party chairman who supports Mr. Cuomo. "The movement is just around Labor Day."
Mr. Cuomo and his advisers said they would continue to focus on some of their core issues, including corporate responsibility. Mr. Cuomo released an ad yesterday on that theme, with people speaking of losing money or jobs at corporations caught up in the recent wave of accounting scandals, that will be broadcast in upstate New York.
Political analysts say that it may be too soon to call the race but that Mr. Cuomo faces many obstacles, both in the primary and, if he prevails, in a contest against Mr. Pataki.
There are many voters inclined to dislike him, according to several polls, and despite the sluggish economy Mr. Pataki continues to enjoy high ratings.

HEADLINE: ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: THE OVERVIEW; 
EX-ENRON OFFICIAL ADMITS PAYMENTS TO FINANCE CHIEF

BYLINE:  By KURT EICHENWALD 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Aug. 21 

 BODY:
A former Enron finance executive told a federal judge here today that he had paid large kickbacks to the company's former chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, out of money he received for managing a partnership that was used to help the company hide debt and increase profits. 
 The admission by the executive, Michael J. Kopper, came as he pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering, crimes that arose from his dealings with partnerships that ultimately led to Enron's financial collapse. Mr. Kopper also settled a civil case brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission and agreed to turn over to the government $12 million that was obtained through criminal activity. 
 Mr. Kopper's plea bargain, which requires his cooperation with the investigation into Enron's collapse, was considered by prosecutors to be a big step forward in the inquiry. People involved in the case said Mr. Kopper had provided details of wrongdoing that exceeded his admissions in court, including important leads related to senior executives other than Mr. Fastow. 
The government acted rapidly on its recently obtained evidence, filing a request seeking the forfeiture of about $23 million in assets held by Mr. Fastow and some of his associates, people involved in the case said. That request has not yet been ruled on, but some details of the assets involved were described in the criminal charges, including millions of dollars held in bank accounts by Mr. Fastow, members of his family and former Enron executives. 
The deal with Mr. Kopper also provided a strong signal that prosecutors in the Enron investigation -- who have been criticized by some members of Congress for moving too slowly -- have instead been methodically building a case against former company officials by using a building-block strategy of turning lower-level executives against their superiors. News analysis, Page C1. 
"This is a substantial breakthrough in our investigation," said Leslie Caldwell, the head of the Justice Department's Enron task force, adding that Mr. Kopper's knowledge "will become our knowledge." 
But the deal was a transformation that played out at a deeply personal level as well, as Mr. Kopper publicly accepted that his future depended on abandoning his loyalty to his friend Mr. Fastow.
In calm and measured tones in the courtroom, Mr. Kopper softly described how he and his friend had worked assiduously over many years to use a series of off-the-books partnerships to defraud Enron of millions of dollars.
Some of the remaining employees at Enron reacted with outrage, executives said today, with many finally coming to believe that the company to which they had devoted their lives had been destroyed by the greed of a few insiders.
The statements by Mr. Kopper and information in the court documents seemed to upend the oft-repeated argument that the partnerships established by Enron were simply a valid strategy that had gone horribly awry. Rather, with Mr. Kopper's tales of kickbacks and secret deals, legal experts said, the entire strategy has lost its veneer of a business idea and taken on the air of little more than a financial fraud.
In effect, as described by the government, the partnership strategy at Enron was a series of lies within lies. Executives used it to hide the true state of the company's finances and holdings from Wall Street and from regulators, and then used it again to funnel vast amounts of money to themselves without the knowledge of shareholders. Based on Mr. Kopper's admissions, the managers of the partnerships -- which had to meet certain requirements of independence to be used as a valid business strategy -- were so closely linked in the lucrative scheme that the entities they ran were entwined with one another and with the company they were supposed to benefit. 
"The conspirators created an array of companies designed to disguise Enron's vulnerability to risk and losses, and to benefit the conspirators at the expense of Enron's shareholders," the deputy attorney general, Larry D. Thompson, said at a news conference in Washington. 
Outside the courtroom, David Howard, a lawyer for Mr. Kopper, read a statement on his behalf as his client stood silently beside him. "Michael has admitted that he misused his position at Enron to enrich himself and others," Mr. Howard said. "He apologizes to all whose lives have been affected by what he did." 
Gordon Andrew, a spokesman for Mr. Fastow, declined comment. Mr. Kopper, who is 37, was released pending sentencing on a $5 million bond. He faces a maximum sentence of 15 years on the two charges.
The two felonies to which Mr. Kopper pleaded guilty arose from transactions involving three Enron partnerships, known as RADR, Chewco and Southampton. The last two are generally well known; RADR, or risk adjusted discount rate, has been raised only tangentially in the past and had never been mentioned as possibly involving criminal violations. 
RADR was used, according to the charges, to allow Enron to sidestep energy regulations. In early 1997, Enron was about to lose certain government benefits it received for owning wind farms because of its purchase of a public utility. Rather than give up the benefits, according to the charges, several Enron executives, including Mr. Kopper and Mr. Fastow, devised a method of using RADR "to enrich themselves and enable Enron to retain secret control over the California wind farms." 
For the partnership to be used properly, Enron would have had to secure independent investors to buy at least 3 percent of RADR. But instead, according to the charges, Mr. Kopper and Mr. Fastow turned to friends, including Mr. Kopper's domestic partner and a friend of Mr. Fastow's wife, Lea.
Mr. Fastow advanced the money for the RADR investment to Mr. Kopper, who provided it to the friends who had been lined up. The friends then funneled distributions from the partnership back to Mr. Fastow through Mr. Kopper to repay the unsecured loan. In other words, Mr. Fastow was the group's only true investor, which obliterated Enron's ability to call RADR independent. 
Between 1997 and 2000, the partnership generated $2.7 million in distributions, and an additional gain of $1.8 million when Enron repurchased RADR. Two of the friends were then instructed to transfer portions of their proceeds to Enron insiders -- including Mr. Fastow and Mr. Kopper and their family members. 
Another partnership involved in the illegal actions was Chewco, which was established in 1997 to buy an outside investor's stake in another entity, Jedi. Mr. Kopper was named as the manager of Chewco. But again, the partnership did not meet the requirements for outside equity investors because the vast majority of the outside money came from loans guaranteed by Enron. 
Over three years, Mr. Kopper received $1.5 million in management fees from Chewco, portions of which he kicked back to Mr. Fastow. Those payments were made by check to members of Mr. Fastow's family, the charges say. At one point, Mr. Fastow arranged for Enron to pay Chewco $400,000 as a "nuisance fee" to amend a partnership agreement; more than $67,000 of that was kicked back to Mr. Fastow, the charges say. 
The last transaction involved the Southampton partnership. The scheme was complex, but effectively involved having Enron pay $30 million for an asset, and then turning over only $11 million to the asset's original owner. Mr. Fastow, Mr. Kopper and other participants then divided the remaining $19 million among themselves, the charges say. 
The Southampton transactions, as described in the charges, involved multiple layers of deceit in which both Enron and a bank, National Westminster, were lied to by their employees. The bank, which held an interest in an asset called Swap Sub, was persuaded by three of its bankers to sell it for $1 million to Southampton, which Mr. Kopper controlled. The bankers, who were secretly working with Mr. Kopper and Mr. Fastow, held an indirect ownership stake in Southampton. 
Within weeks, Mr. Fastow and Mr. Kopper persuaded Enron to pay $30 million to buy out Swap Sub. Of that, $10 million went to another bank that invested in the deal, and $20 million went to Southampton.

Kopper, a former executive at Enron, worked with Andrew S. Fastow, the company's former chief financial officer, to create entities whose ostensible purpose was to invest in Enron assets, but which really served to enrich the executives themselves and others. Here, according to the government, are the entities that were involved and how the schemes worked.

HEADLINE: New York Vacations for the Tourist-Weary 

BYLINE:  By ANDY NEWMAN 

 BODY:
At the Howard Beach subway station near Kennedy International Airport, budget travelers troop off the A train and roll their luggage grimly along the platform, steeling themselves for the gantlet ahead: the shuttle bus, the check-in lines, the gates, the waits, the endless cramped flight. 
 But why not leave the lemmings at the turnstile? Cross back over the tracks and head off into the real unknown. 
 Consider a vacation in the outer boroughs.
A journey to Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx or Staten Island is not such a radical idea. Until the advent of plane and car, most New Yorkers ventured no farther for their holidays than the bungalows of the Rockaways or the hotels of Coney Island. 
But in a been-there, done-that world where you're just as likely to run into your next-door neighbor atop Annapurna as at the corner deli, a foray to the city's borders offers a chance to see life as it is really lived. Although 80 percent of the city's population live in the outer boroughs, they have relatively few tourists. And as any traveler knows, it is tourists that really ruin a vacation.

QUEENS: Howard Beach, A Land of Contrasts
A 20-minute stroll from the Howard Beach subway station, through tidy streets of detached houses, brings you to Cross Bay Boulevard, a beachy thoroughfare lined with clam bars, nail salons and the only Starbucks in the New York area with a rooftop tanning deck.
Another 15 minutes' walk down the boulevard lies the Surfside 3 Motel. From most rooms, which go for $100 a night, the surf is tough to spot. But there is, behind a chain-link fence in the parking lot, a channel called Shellbank Basin lined on both sides with docks and pleasure craft.
While the Surfside, like most outer-borough motels, does a lot of its business providing what the hospitality industry calls "short stays," the sleaze factor hovers near zero. The rooms are clean and pleasantly furnished, and as long as you steer clear of Channel 34 on the room TV, condoms in the vending machine are the only visible sordor, and even they are tucked unobtrusively next to the vanilla wafers and Kit Kat bars. 
Now it is time for lunch. Gus, the concierge, suggests Prima Pasta, a nice place with green-and-white-clothed tables on the sidewalk, elegant service and decent food. You could be in Venice, except that in place of a canal, there are six lanes of heavy traffic roaring by less than 10 feet away. The squeals of Camaro tires are drowned out by the screeching of young children just inside the bright-red fence of a maximum-security Burger King play area next door. 
To most New Yorkers, Howard Beach, 16 years after the fact, still conjures images of a gang of white youths beating and chasing a black man to his death on the Belt Parkway.
There are no State Department advisories for domestic travel, and it was difficult for a white observer to take the racial temperature of the neighborhood. On one hand, black and Mexican faces are common along Cross Bay Boulevard. But the old part of Howard Beach, east of Shellbank Basin, is quite white, and an "Arabs out of America" sticker glares down from the back of a stop sign there.
Across Shellbank Basin is Frank M. Charles Memorial Park, a popular place to promenade. In the evening, dozens of power-walkers, mostly well-tanned women in full makeup and jewelry, circumambulate the half-mile track that rings the park. 
Beyond the walking track, a path leads down to Jamaica Bay. Tresses of deep green sea grass wave in the sloshing tide. A coconut, husk and all, rests on the sand, hinting at an impossibly long journey.
Farther down, a battered little sailboat, the Fair Lady, sits on the beach. In the dark recesses of the boat, a figure stirs, a movement of whiskers. It is William Rosenberg. He lives on the boat. He is shipwrecked.
The boat, Mr. Rosenberg says, is usually docked across the channel, behind the Amoco station. But the day before, he took it out and got caught in a gale that slammed him into the shore and broke off the Fair Lady's rudder.
Mr. Rosenberg has long white hair and a long white beard. He is remarkably fit for a man of 57. When the tide ebbs, he intends to dig the boat out and relaunch it. While he waits for the tide, he scoops stew from a saucepan onto a folded sheet of newspaper.
"I'm in the middle of feeding my hamsters," he explains.
There are 20 of them. They live in big plastic pretzel jars with mesh-covered air holes. "They're having a feast tonight," he says. "Beef stew, canned peas, peaches and sweet potatoes."
Mr. Rosenberg is shown the coconut. He says it floated over from the Rockaway side of the bay. "That comes from the Indian people," he says. "They offer it to their gods." This explains the profusion of carnations and other flowers floating in the surf.

Staten Island
Near Fort Wadsworth, A Place of Peace
Around 1840, a shipping magnate named Lewis Henry Meyer built a grand estate on 18 densely wooded acres of Staten Island near what is now the inactive Fort Wadsworth Naval Station. In addition to a mansion, a big barn and a tall brick water tower, it had a bear pit.
Now the property is home to the Mount Manresa Jesuit Retreat House, which says it is the only retreat house in New York City. For a suggested donation of $50 a day you can stay there, wander the hilly grounds and meditate on anything or, if you can manage it, nothing at all. A consultation with a priest is available if you wish.
The rooms in the collegiate-looking brick-and-sandstone dormitory are simple but comfortable, furnished with little more than a bed, a chair and a Bible. There is a cozy chapel. A dark corner of the hallway is guarded by a life-size statue of Pope Pius X. 
The food is wholesome, church-luncheon fare -- tuna salad, cold cuts, fruit, doughnuts, ice cream -- and retreatants may help themselves, day or night. 
The isolation of the retreat is not quite complete. The grounds, now whittled down to nine acres, are bordered on one side by the round-the-clock throom of the Staten Island Expressway and on two others by encroaching town houses, so close you could grab a hot dog off the grill on someone's back deck. The retreat itself is not always quiet either. Next month, it will be the temporary home of a team of Chinese acrobats.
Still, for a sanctuary a few hundred yards from the entrance to the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, it's pretty glorious. There are flower gardens everywhere, and a wood of tall trees slopes up to a meadow that looks out onto rooftops, and, beyond, the skyline of Lower Manhattan.
The bear pit is now occupied by a statue of the Sacred Heart, before which stands an altar filled with tributes to Sept. 11 victims.
In the meditation garden, a big oak tree was felled in 1999 by lightning. The Jesuits did not move it. It looks like a sign from above, a gentle reminder to heed the advice from Micah 6:8 carved on a stone there: "God asks only this: act justly, love tenderly, walk humbly with your God."

Brooklyn
Greenpoint Offers Boundless Bargains
If all that soul-searching has you yearning for the distraction of fellow travelers despite yourself, perhaps it's time to take a break and check into the Greenpoint, Brooklyn, Y.M.C.A. Where else in the city, or anywhere for that matter, can you get a bed and delicious breakfast for two at a resort that has an indoor pool, a sauna and a 24-hour gym, all for $85?
"It's fantastic," says a bearded Swedish statistician named Hans who is paying $10 less for a room with his daughter because it lacks an air conditioner. "We thought the price must be some kind of trick." 
It is no trick. In fact, if you neglect to book in advance on the hottest day of the summer and get stuck in a room with one twin bed and no air conditioner, the price is a mere $40. This is so cheap you can afford to head down to Dee and Dee Stores on Manhattan Avenue and pick up a Breeze'n Two-Speed Window Fan for $20.
All of Greenpoint, the city's only Polish-speaking neighborhood, abounds with such bargains.
At the Slodycze store half a block from the Y, a large bar of luscious Polish Wedel chocolate is 89 cents. An excellent haircut on Manhattan Avenue, the main drag, is $8, including eyebrow trim. At a restaurant called Pyza on Nassau Avenue, you can get a large refreshing bowl of pink, dilly borscht, a plate of carrot salad, a scoop of mashed potatoes topped with fried onions and parsley, and a tumbler of kompot, a Tang-like substance, for $3.25
Then there is the free breakfast.
And like everywhere else in New York, the waterfront is free if you can find it. Manhattan Avenue dead-ends in a tiny dock perched over Newtown Creek. At night, the still air echoes with far-off industrial sounds. If you are very lucky, around midnight, an immense barge loaded with crushed stone will puff by, and you will think of Gdansk.

The Bronx
At Co-op City, Poetry of Daily Life
Co-op City, the enclave of stark high-rises in the northeast Bronx that combines the charm of a Soviet apartment block with the pedestrian-friendly layout of a long-term parking lot, is one of those places about which outsiders like to say, "There is no there there." 
But of course there is there everywhere, and the 50,000 residents of Co-op City, which calls itself the World's Largest Cooperative Community, bond to their home like anyone else, as a day and a night there will demonstrate (you can stay at the comfortable, clean Econo-Lodge at the edge of the complex, a 10-minute walk from the Baychester Avenue stop on the 5 train). Co-op City residents worship in windowless churches in the basement community rooms of 30-story buildings. They sip coffee in sunken AstroTurfed parklets. They scan the bland headlines in the weekly Co-op City Times ("Garage 7 to close Monday: New parking plans to take effect in Section 5") and skip to the juicy columns inside, in which Co-op City's elected officials routinely trash one another. They play bingo, and when someone sneezes, everyone says "bless you." 
There are even a few tourists there. Down a dirt path behind an apartment building, through a hole cut in a fence, lies Co-op City's unlikely beauty spot, an abandoned pier that looks across the Hutchinson River at an island full of egrets and herons. People fish from it and a teenage boy named Ramon, up from the Dominican Republic visiting his mom, has discovered it. Near dusk, she comes down to fetch him. "Come on, say goodbye to your friends," she says. "You're going back to Santo Domingo tomorrow."
Back in Co-op City, in the Bagel Cafe in the Bay Plaza Shopping Center, no sooner does a traveler sit down to eat his bread pudding than a man in a "Total Electric" baseball cap strikes up a conversation.
The man, Steve, a 34-year-old unemployed stockbroker's assistant who has not been away from Co-op City for more than two weeks at a time since moving there as a toddler, explains the place's attraction.
"People who move out of here, even if they don't have family here anymore, they always come back," he says. "People curse this place at the top of their lungs, but they come back. That shows you that it has a special spirit. Maybe something you'd call a nostalgic sentiment."
Steve concedes that his attachment to Co-op City does not lie in the specifics.
"It's more an emotional comfort," he says. "Like it's home. Like when you go on vacation, it's good to go, but it's good to come home."

HEADLINE: HSBC Buying Fifth-Largest Bank in Mexico for $1.1 Billion 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH MALKIN 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Aug. 21 

 BODY:
HSBC Holdings said today that it had agreed to buy Mexico's fifth-largest banking group, Grupo Financiero Bital, for $1.14 billion, giving HSBC a strong presence in Latin America's healthiest economy.
 The purchase means that just one banking group, Grupo Financiero Banorte, the country's fourth largest, remains under government ownership. Since the government began to sell all the financial institutions it took over during the 1995 banking crisis here, Citigroup, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria and Banco Santander Central Hispano have bought Mexico's three biggest banks. 
 Analysts said the acquisition -- for $1.20 a share, a premium of 20 percent over Tuesday's closing price -- is a vote of confidence in Mexico at a time when its economy is barely recovering from recession and when global banks, including HSBC, have been hard hit in Argentina and are wary in Brazil. 
But HSBC argued that it views the Bital deal as part of a North American, not a Latin American strategy.
"It will enable us to become one of the few banks that can facilitate trade seamlessly among the three Nafta countries," said Alexander F. Flockhart, the HSBC executive who will become Bital's chief after the acquisition is completed. HSBC is the 10th-largest bank in the United States and the 7th largest in Canada.
Bital was the last Mexican bank that had yet to clean up its balance sheet as a result of the 1995 crisis, caused when the devaluation of the peso sent interest rates soaring to 100 percent and borrowers simply stopped paying on their debts. Bital still needs about $450 million to meet tightened Mexican capital-reserves regulations, according to Bital's current chief executive, Jaime Ruiz Sacristan. Mr. Flockhart declined to estimate how much money HSBC would need to inject into Bital. With a cost-income ratio above 70 percent, Bital compares poorly with HSBC's average of 52 to 55 percent.
In Bital, HSBC is acquiring a bank with six million depositors and 1,400 branches, which will be HSBC's second-largest network after its network in Britain. Although most of Bital's customers are small depositors, they may eventually become customers for an expanded range of loans that HSBC said it hoped to introduce. In addition, Mr. Flockhart said he expected to expand Bital's activities to encompass middle-market commercial banking, institutional banking and private banking.
Now that foreign banks are in almost complete control of the Mexican banking system, analysts said they expected that consumer lending could loosen up as the banks looked to increase income.
"Mexico is really going to see a lot more competition in the coming years," said Bruno Pereira, Latin America banking analyst for UBS Warburg in Rio de Janiero.
All that is needed to spur lending are new laws making it easier for lenders to collect collateral in a default, said Yolanda Courtines, Latin America banking analyst for J. P. Morgan Securities. Starting next year, she added, mortgage payments on mortgages will be tax deductible, which should stimulate demand.
In deciding to sell the bank outright, the controlling shareholders acknowledged that it was all but impossible for a national bank to survive on its own. "The shareholders realized that today, in a globalized world, where banking is increasingly in hands of global companies, competing is difficult and risky and it's better to leave the bank in the hands of experts," said Luis Berrondo, chairman of GF Bital and part of the group that controls 52 percent of the bank.
Banco Santander Central Hispano owns about 21 percent of Bital but is expected to sell its stake. The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of the year.

HEADLINE: In Brazil, Gol Succeeds in the No-Frills Path 

BYLINE:  By TONY SMITH 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, Aug. 21 

 BODY:
After a friendly preflight greeting in Portuguese, flight attendants for Gol, a domestic airline that hauls Brazilians across their vast country, announce: "Hi, folks! Welcome to Gol, the really youngest fleet in Brazil."
 The tropical imitation of a Southern drawl may be jarring. But for anyone who has ever flown Southwest Airlines, that "Hi folks!" is a sure sign of where Gol, Brazil's first budget airline, is coming from. 
 "Southwest was our main inspiration, but we made a benchmark from them, EasyJet, JetBlue and Ryanair," said Constantino de Oliveira Jr., 34, the chairman and chief executive of Gol.
Following the path of these American and Irish upstarts, which, through cheap pricing and smart routing, have managed to buck the post-Sept. 11 trend of fewer passengers and lower profits, Gol has grown into Brazil's third-largest airline in less than two years. Varig, the country's biggest airline, is facing its worst crisis in its 75-year history, and the No. 2, TAM Linhas Aereas, although financially healthier, is still cutting back on an ambitious expansion plan. 
Gol, which in Portuguese means "goal," as in soccer, is privately owned. It carried its five millionth passenger this month and is set to take delivery of four more Boeing 737-800's next month. That will give the airline a fleet of 19 planes, as its staff increases to 1,700 and its destinations to 23 cities. In the first half of this year, Gol was Brazil's most punctual airline and, with an average 76 percent occupancy rate in June, the most efficient, according to data from the country's Civil Aviation Department.
Despite market turmoil that has sent Brazil's currency and bond prices into a spin and has chief executives of several other airlines adopting crash positions, Mr. Oliveira -- known universally as Junior -- wants to have 18 percent of the domestic market and to break even by the end of the year. For 2001, its debut year, Gol reported a $2 million loss.
"Budget airlines are ideal for a developing country like Brazil -- we're talking a very price-sensitive market here," he said.
Few countries, even developed ones, can match Brazil's population, size and disposable income in terms of growth potential for a no-frills domestic airline.
Carlos Albano, an analyst at Unibanco, a major Brazilian bank, said Gol's lean structure, lack of debt and unusual sales pitch put it "in a privileged position."
"Although it's still too early to say whether it will survive long term, Gol has certainly been a success story so far," he added. "Revolution might be too strong a word, but Gol has definitely shaken up the market."
Before Gol, Brazilians relied on four major private airlines that were frequently run inefficiently in a highly regulated market that stifled true competition. With liberalization in the late 1990's, a flock of small charter airlines took to the air, but they were denied full status as scheduled airlines and mainly served tourist destinations on Brazil's northeastern coast.
Mr. Oliveira, who is a pilot and a 1992 South American Formula Three car racing champion, brings his own unpretentious style to work. Unlike most top Sao Paulo executives, he has no chauffeur and no armored car; he drives to his minimalist office at Gol's modest headquarters in Sao Paulo in his VW Golf.
Mr. Oliveira cut his business teeth managing Brazil's biggest bus transport empire, Grupo Aurea, founded by his father. He recalls as a teenager hearing his father dream out loud about his bus fleet sprouting wings and becoming an airline with prices so low that any Brazilian could afford to fly.
"It definitely helped me, coming from the bus business," he said. "The cost structures are very similar: your variables are fuel, vehicles, spare parts, ticketing, network."
He added with a wry smile, "In the bus transport business, you have to fight for every cent."
As Gol's first Boeings took off in January 2001, executives at Brazil's traditional airlines -- Varig, TAM, VASP and Transbrasil -- as well as many aviation analysts predicted that the newcomer would not stay aloft for long. Brazilian carriers must pay airport taxes almost double those in the United States, though most must deal with strong labor unions. Aircraft leasing and fuel costs are paid in dollars, even though tickets are sold in reais, a currency that has lost nearly a third of its value this year.
Critics derided Mr. Oliveira's contention that Gol would make ends meet by harnessing Brazil's boom in telecommunications, Internet and credit card use and by slashing costs through the elimination of hot meals and printed tickets.
Now, Gol's competitors are the ones in trouble. A bitter price war spurred by Gol's aggressive structure deeply cut revenues that were already under pressure from a drop in international air travel after the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States, making it harder for the traditional airlines to pay their huge debts, accrued over years of economic instability in Brazil.
Transbrasil is broke and has not flown for nine months. TAM has put international expansion plans on hold. Varig, once the jewel in the crown of Brazilian aviation and a partner of United Airlines and Lufthansa of Germany in the Star Alliance, is overwhelmed with $900 million debt and just named a new chief executive. VASP made a costly overextension into the international market and is only now recovering; Gol overtook it in passenger terms in March.
"Yes, times are hard, but for a business model like ours, they are much less hard than for our competitors," Mr. Oliveira said. "In times of crisis, people keep a much closer eye on their money."
Like the tail wagging the dog, Gol's tiny fleet forced the larger airlines' fares on competitive routes down by about 40 percent, though they are still generally higher than Gol's. Sometimes, flying Gol can be cheaper than buying a bus ticket. In its first year, 4 percent of the airline's 2.5 million passengers were first-time fliers, and this year Gol expects that figure to reach 9 percent.
In a country where roads are bad and distances huge and many people earn less than the supposed minimum guaranteed monthly wage of $65, "Gol is increasingly seen as a politically correct airline," said Tarcisio Gargioni, the vice president for marketing and services at the company. "We are helping a lot of simple people realize their dreams."
No-frills airlines might be commonplace in developed nations, but Gol's cheap but cheerful image has been a breath of fresh air in Brazil. And even though it has no business class or first class, more and more executives are flying Gol.
To cut costs, boarding passes are printed at the airport in exchange for a reservation code instead of printed tickets. Bookings are mainly made by telephone or on the Internet and paid for immediately by credit card or by check within three days, so Gol spends a fraction of the industry's 24 percent average on travel agents' commissions.
By substituting granola bars for what Mr. Oliveira disparagingly calls "those warmed-up omelets" served by traditional airlines, Gol's planes are loaded just once a day for as many as 14 trips. Instead of a separate cleaning crew, on-board employees, dressed in a uniform of T-shirts and slacks, tidy the cabin at each stop. "Nuts!," the book by Kevin and Jackie Freiberg about Southwest's founder, Herbert D. Kelleher, is required reading for flight attendant trainees.
All these efforts make a Gol plane's average time on the ground 20 minutes, 10 minutes less than competitors, Mr. Oliveira said.
Then, too, there is that fleet of sophisticated Boeings.
"Had we bought old planes, it would have left the company open to claims by competitors that we lacked safety and technology," Mr. Oliveira said. "So we opted for new planes, the most modern, the most fuel efficient. You have to pay higher leasing, but you save on fuel and maintenance, and your image with the public is untouchable."

Prime Minister Jean Chretien announced today that he would not seek a fourth term and would leave office in February 2004, rather than try to overcome an open revolt against his leadership in the governing Liberal Party.
 Mr. Chretien has been a dominant force in Canadian politics for a generation and prime minister for nine years, but recent polls have indicated that the electorate has grown tired of his often gruff and autocratic style despite several years of economic growth. 
 His decision came after months of bitter party infighting, in which a former finance minister, Paul Martin, was gathering momentum for a showdown at a party conference in February.
Many Liberal leaders say the delegates at the conference would have stopped short of endorsing Mr. Chretien and voted instead to conduct a leadership review, which most probably would have replaced Mr. Chretien, 68, with Mr. Martin, 63, as party leader and led to new elections.
"I will not run again," Mr. Chretien said in a hastily called news conference in Saguenay, Quebec, where Liberal members of Parliament are caucusing to discuss policy. He explained that his decision not to pursue a fourth term was the "best way to bring back unity, to end the fighting and to resume interrupted friendships."
Mr. Martin and Mr. Chretien are both pragmatic moderates, and a leadership change in the dominant party is not expected to change the country's direction in a fundamental way. But Mr. Chretien's decision is likely to guarantee his leadership to the end of his term, and give other leaders closer to him an opportunity to contest Mr. Martin for the post.
First elected to Parliament in 1963, Mr. Chretien was given the most difficult tasks by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau in the 1970's, including leadership of the campaign to keep Quebec from voting in a referendum for independence. He was the first French Canadian to serve as finance minister, and was a leading force in reforming federal policies toward indigenous peoples.
As prime minister, he improved the government's finances, which suffered from deep budget deficits in the early 1990's. He switched from being an opposition critic to free trade with the United States in the 1980's, to become as prime minister a strong supporter of firmer economic ties. But he has been criticized for failing to make needed reforms in the overburdened national health system.
In recent months, his government has been racked by conflict-of-interest scandals that showed several cabinet members took favors from corporations and handed out contracts to friends and companies that contributed to the Liberal Party.
Mr. Martin reacted to Mr. Chretien's announcement with praise for his longtime rival "as an outstanding prime minister." He added, "He is a man of whom I hold the greatest respect" and then refused to take questions from reporters.

HEADLINE: The Crash in Chechnya: Russia's Gaping Wound 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Aug. 21 

 BODY:
The catastrophic loss of a Russian military helicopter on Monday has exposed all that has gone wrong with Moscow's war in Chechnya and the potential political consequences of President Vladimir V. Putin's inability to end it.
 At its most basic, the crash near the main Russian military base in Chechnya shattered Russia's efforts to portray the situation as stable, if not normal, and resurrected lingering doubts about the strategy for winning a conflict that increasingly seems unwinable. 
 Chechnya is Russia's open wound, but it is like an illness that no one dares speak about. Despite the mounting losses, the accusations of atrocities by Russian forces and the reports of terrorism by separatist fighters, there has been little public or political debate in Russia about the war. The crash may make the war impossible to ignore. 
Although the United States and European countries have muted their criticism of Russian actions in Chechnya since Sept. 11, the conflict remains an obstacle to Mr. Putin's efforts to integrate Russia more closely with the West. It has undercut his efforts to stabilize the country's southern flank, to reform its military, to liberalize its society and to get on with the strengthening of its political and economic reforms. 
"By all means, the war is the obstacle to the development of Russia today," said Sergei N. Yushenkov, a member of the newly formed Liberal Russia party and a proponent of efforts to negotiate an end to the conflict.
The death toll in the crash, now 115, is by far the worse single loss of Russian lives in a three-year-old war that Mr. Putin's government long ago claimed to have won.
Two days after the crash there are still inconclusive and contradictory explanations for why the helicopter went down.
On Tuesday, senior officials sent to investigate announced "strong evidence" -- a discarded rocket launcher found nearby -- that Chechen rebels had brought it down. But today they acknowledged that that evidence was far from conclusive, saying it could be a month before the cause was known. Others questioned the sorry state of maintenance and the military incompetence that let a helicopter designed to carry 80 people take off with 147 on board.
Either explanation would be a damning indictment of the state of the war today, one that reflects poorly on the military and, by extension, Mr. Putin's supervision of the war effort.
If mechanical or planning errors were responsible, then the military proved itself unable to transport troops safely on a short 45-minute hop from its main staging base in North Ossetia. If rebel fighters did it, as they claimed, the military cannot protect even its heavily fortified headquarters at Khankala, just east of the Chechen capital, Grozny.
"The most horrible thing in this horrible tragedy is that the helicopter fell on a minefield," said Valentina D. Melnikova, a leader of the Union of Soldiers Mothers Committees, one of Russia's largest antiwar groups. "This means that Khankala's defense against the Chechens worked against the Russians." 
What the crash has done is thrust the war back into Russia's public consciousness, or at least into the headlines. Since Russian forces stormed Chechnya a second time in 1999, more than 4,000 soldiers and security officers have been killed, according to official counts, but the deaths have come in a slow trickle, not all at once.
Immediately after the crash, Mr. Putin dispatched the minister of defense, Sergei B. Ivanov, and the top prosecutor, Vladimir V. Ustinov, to oversee the inquiry and the recovery of the dead. Today he met with Russia's senior military commander, Gen. Anatoly Kvashnin, to discuss how to ensure the security of Russian forces moving in and out of Chechnya.
His flurry of activity seemed intended to avert the storm of criticism he faced when the nuclear-powered submarine Kursk sank in the Barents Sea two years ago, killing all 118 crew members. 
The question now is whether the crash will be enough to catalyze so-far fitful efforts to resolve the conflict. Mr. Putin, in a news conference in June, expressed regret for the notoriously violent sweeps through Chechnya by Russian security forces and pledged that work was under way for a new constitution and elections. 
In Switzerland earlier this month, there were informal contacts between a former secretary of Russia's security council, Ivan Rybkin, and representatives of Chechnya's main rebel group, led by Aslan Maskhadov. Many in Russia, including political figures, have suggested that negotiations, not more fighting, are the only way to settle Chechnya's centuries-old desire for independence.
Even the Communist leader, Gennadi A. Zyuganov, whose views are strongly nationalistic, said today that the second war in Chechnya was launched with no clear idea of how to win it. The result was a quagmire, he said; the answer is economic reform and the end to corruption and banditry in Chechnya.
"This is not just idiocy," he said in an interview on Ekho Moskvy, referring to Russia's strategy in Chechnya, "but criminal idiocy of the people who start a war and a fight without realizing what the outcome may be."
Mr. Putin, for all his political dominance, is still subject to the influences of doves who want to end the war and hawks who want to crush Chechen resistance. For now, Mr. Yushenko said, the hawks hold sway. There has also been no groundswell of public outrage over the crash, like there was when the Kursk sank. 
Ms. Melnikova said she doubted that the crash would galvanize pressure on Mr. Putin. "Our president is a K.G.B. colonel," she said, "and his views are a typical response to the system in which he was educated and raised. It is difficult to believe that the death of 115 people in a helicopter crash would influence his position to the war."

HEADLINE: Argentine Junta Felt Safe From the U.S. 

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 21 

 BODY:
Leaders of the military dictatorship that took control of Argentina in 1976 believed that the Ford administration supported their crackdown on leftist insurgents and would not penalize them for rights abuses, newly declassified State Department documents show. 
 The documents indicate that American Embassy officials in Buenos Aires frequently felt frustrated in their efforts to encourage the Argentine government to rein in military and paramilitary units that were systematically killing, torturing and kidnapping suspected leftists -- including several American citizens -- during the summer and fall of 1976. 
 Repeatedly, senior Argentine officials brushed aside concerns raised by embassy officials, saying that Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger and other top Ford administration officials supported their war against Communists and were not deeply worried about rights abuses, several documents show. 
After President Jimmy Carter took office in 1977, the State Department became much more aggressive in opposing human rights abuses. At the insistence of Congress, military and economic aid to Argentina was cut. And in Buenos Aires, the embassy became a collection center for information about victims of torture, murder and kidnapping. 
But though the message from Washington changed, many of the abuses continued, experts said. The military dictatorship was replaced by a civilian government in elections held in 1983.
In one cable to Mr. Kissinger, dated Oct. 14, 1976, Ambassador Robert Hill complained that the Argentine foreign minister, Cesar Augusto Guzzetti, returned from a visit to Washington feeling "ecstatic" about relations with the United States. 
"Guzzetti went to the U.S. fully expecting to hear some strong, firm, direct warning of his government's human rights practices," Mr. Hill continued. "Rather than that, he has returned in a state of jubilation, convinced that there is no real problem" with the United Statesover this issue. 
In another cable to Washington, dated Sept. 20, 1976, Mr. Hill wrote that Mr. Guzzetti said that Mr. Kissinger had expressed no concerns about rights abuses in a meeting in Santiago, Chile. Indeed, Mr. Guzzetti suggested that Mr. Kissinger supported what the Argentine government called its war on terrorism and was encouraging President Jorge Rafael Videla of Argentina to move swiftly in crushing the insurgency. 
"When he had seen Secy of State Kissinger in Santiago, the latter had said he hoped the Argentine govt. could get the terrorist problem under control as quickly as possible," Mr. Hill wrote. "Guzzetti said that he had reported this to President Videla and to the cabinet, and that their impression" had been that the United States' "overriding concern was not human rights" but rather that Argentina " 'get it over quickly.' " 
Mr. Kissinger did not return phone calls from a reporter seeking comment.
But William Rogers, who was under secretary of state for economic affairs in 1976, said in an interview tonight that Mr. Kissinger publicly and privately told Argentine officials that human rights abuses would not be tolerated. He said Mr. Guzzetti misunderstood Mr. Kissinger if he thought the Ford administration was acquiescing to abuses.
The cables were among 4,677 documents dating from 1975 to 1984 that were declassified and released by the State Department on Tuesday at the behest of rights groups, families of victims of the military crackdown and several governments that are considering prosecuting Argentine officials for abuses. 
The documents are expected to shed light on the repression of Argentine leftists in the late 1970's and aid in the prosecution of 31 Argentine military officers recently charged with rights abuses from that period. 
Scholars and rights advocates who have begun sifting through the trove say there are no detailed descriptions of Mr. Kissinger's meetings with Mr. Guzzetti. 
In his cables, Mr. Hill did not say he believed that Mr. Kissinger or other officials had meant to give a green light to abuses by the Argentine military. Indeed, he asserted in one letter that Mr. Guzzetti was "seeing only what he wanted to see" during a visit to Washington. 
"But the results," he added, "nevertheless are the same."
The dispatches, which were compiled by the National Security Archive at George Washington University, depict both conflicting messages from the Ford administration and efforts by the Argentine dictatorship to play off embassy officials against State Department officials. 
Mr. Hill also urged the State Department to write the Videla government to correct the Argentine president's "overly optimistic view" concerning Washington's opinion of the rights abuses. It is not clear whether such a letter was ever sent.

HEADLINE: For Black Politicians, 2 Races Suggest a Rise of New Tactics 

BYLINE:  By LYNETTE CLEMETSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 21 

 BODY:
The defeat of Representative Cynthia A. McKinney in a Democratic primary on Tuesday -- the second loss this summer by a prominent black House incumbent to a more moderate black challenger -- carries implications for black politicians, and perhaps others as well, that go far beyond any single Congressional district.
 Denise Majette, a former state judge who defeated Ms. McKinney in the primary in Georgia's Fourth District, in the suburbs of Atlanta, capitalized on the furor caused by Ms. McKinney's suggestion this year that President Bush might have known about the Sept. 11 attacks but did nothing so his supporters could make money in a war. 
 In the earlier race, political analysts said Artur Davis, who defeated Representative Earl F. Hilliard, an Alabama Democrat, in June, benefited from Mr. Hilliard's history of ethical lapses. 
Last summer, he was rebuked by the House Ethics Committee for converting campaign gifts to his own use.
Both incumbents drew even more attention -- and their challengers gained important political traction -- because they were regarded as unfriendly to Israel. This allowed their opponents to tap into an outpouring of financial contributions from Jewish Americans and other Israel supporters.
Ms. McKinney's opponents were galvanized by her vocal support for Palestinians and the campaign contributions she received from Arab-American donors, some of whom have been under investigation on suspicion of links to terrorism.
Many political experts said today that the victories of the two challengers showed that successful black candidates no longer had to rely solely on rhetoric and tactics of the civil rights era. 
"The black electorate is increasingly well-educated, more entrepreneurial, business-savvy and politically moderate," said Jarvis C. Stewart, a Washington lobbyist and major Democratic fund-raiser. "Many who were not raised in the era of the civil rights movement don't relate to or see the benefit in polarizing politics."
Still, it was the money from campaign contributors motivated by a single issue -- one not directly related to problems and concerns in the candidates' districts -- that allowed the challengers to get out their messages, a fact that has caused resentment from some black politicians. 
"I definitely have some feelings about any outside group exerting this kind of influence in a race, and I've been receiving angry calls from black voters all day, saying they should rally against Jewish candidates," said Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson, a Texas Democrat who is the chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus.
"To have non-African-Americans from around the country putting millions into a race to unseat one of our leaders for expressing her right of free speech is definitely a problem," Ms. Johnson said.
Ms. Majette, who graduated from Yale University and Duke law school, and Mr. Davis are among a group of rising black figures in Democratic politics -- including Representative Harold E. Ford Jr. of Tennessee and Ron Kirk, a former mayor of Dallas running for Senate in Texas -- who are pressing centrist views.
Ms. McKinney, a five-term incumbent, and her supporters expected negative reaction from Republicans and Jewish voters, but political strategists said they might have underestimated the negative effects her positions would have in the black community.
Ron Lester, a Democratic pollster who conducted a survey of voters after the Hilliard-Davis primary in Alabama, said that within that district, black support for Israel had increased markedly since Sept. 11.
Concerning Ms. McKinney, he said that she registered a job approval rating of 70 percent among her black constituents in a poll conducted in June, but that on Tuesday such approval was apparently not enough to override larger worries about her political allegiances.
"Black voters are as emotional about 9/11 as any other voters," Mr. Lester said. "They were happy with the way she served the district, but a certain segment of black voters were very wary of her remarks and the controversy surrounding her."
It did not help that prominent black figures, including Julian Bond, the chairman of the N.A.A.C.P., and former Mayor Maynard Jackson of Atlanta -- who had supported Ms. McKinney in the past -- distanced themselves from her this time.
"People in the black community still think of the comments she made after 9/11, and they are still a little apprehensive," said Alfreida Capers, 51, a DeKalb County resident who campaigned for Ms. McKinney.
"There were some in our community who saw Ms. Majette's advertisements on television and thought they reflected a young, Christian woman with a family who would be less boisterous," Ms. Capers added. "Some certainly thought our congresswoman was too boisterous and they carried that thought with them to the polls."
Ms. Majette garnered 58 percent of the vote on Tuesday to Ms. McKinney's 42 percent, and faces just token opposition in November.
Ms. Majette also outraised Ms. McKinney by nearly two to one, pulling in more than $1.1 million in campaign funds, much of which came from pro-Israel political action committees and individual donors outside of Georgia.
In June, pro-Israel groups funneled money into the race in rural Alabama to help Mr. Davis, a 34-year-old former assistant United States attorney, defeat Mr. Hilliard, a five-term incumbent who was linked to pro-Arab causes. Mr. Davis faces no Republican opposition in November.
"This shows that there is a price to pay for taking a position that is out of step with the views of most Americans," said Morris J. Amitay, founder of the Washington Political Action Committee, a pro-Israel group, and the former executive director of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, one of the country's most powerful pro-Israel lobbying groups.
Others, though, said that the influence of outside groups could depress black turnout.
"For Democrats to do well this year they need solid numbers of black votes," said David Bositis, senior political analyst for the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a Washington-based research group that looks at issues affecting African Americans.
"But if black voters perceive that elections in their districts are ultimately being decided by whites and powerful outside sources with money," Mr. Bositis said, "they may conclude their votes don't matter and decide not to vote at all."
James J. Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute in Washington, said he feared a return to the 1980's, when Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts, the Democratic presidential nominee in 1988, rejected his group's endorsement, and Mayor David Dinkins of New York refused to meet with him, concerned about angering Jewish constituents.
"This painting of Arab-American donors and political participants as being terrorists in disguise is a garish and grotesque caricature," Mr. Zogby said. "This is not about three or four donors, this is about widely targeted politics of exclusion that could end up in the disenfranchising of the entire Arab and Muslim American community."
Members of the Congressional Black Caucus, though many are disappointed at the loss of their colleague Ms. McKinney, said they would welcome Ms. Majette.
"If she comes here willing to work with us and is not skewed by the agenda of her supporters, of course we work with her," Representative Johnson said. "We all know we have to move past this."

CORRECTION-DATE: August 28, 2002

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Thursday about the Democratic primary defeat of Representative Cynthia A. McKinney of Georgia and its aftermath included a name incorrectly among those of black politicians distancing themselves from her. Julian Bond, chairman of the N.A.A.C.P., points out that as head of a nonpartisan organization he does not participate in electoral politics.

HEADLINE: McGreevey Calls Trade Center Land Swap Unlikely 

BYLINE:  By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
Gov. James E. McGreevey said yesterday that it was "relatively unlikely" that the land under Kennedy and La Guardia Airports would be swapped for the site of the World Trade Center.
 Such a proposal has been seen as a way to give New York City and State control over the rebuilding at ground zero. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey owns the trade center site and runs the airports. As governor of New Jersey, Mr. McGreevey essentially has veto power over the proposed land swap by the city and the Port Authority, which he and Gov. George E. Pataki of New York control. 
 "Ultimately, that is a proposal which clearly merits ongoing consideration," Mr. McGreevey said. 
"But yet, as of today, there's a significant difference in the allocated worth of the airports as against the present site" of the trade center, Mr. McGreevey said at a joint news conference with Gov. George E. Pataki.
The idea for the land swap was first proposed three weeks ago by advisers to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, and last night a spokesman for the mayor said City Hall officials were not discouraged by Mr. McGreevey's remarks.
When the concept was announced, it was quickly embraced by some officials as a means of giving New York City and New York State control over the process of rebuilding Lower Manhattan without worries about whether revenues from the commercial space on the trade center site would be enough to satisfy the financial needs of the Port Authority.
In exchange for its 16 acres in Lower Manhattan, the Port Authority would receive the 5,610 acres beneath Kennedy International Airport and La Guardia Airport that are owned by the city, and leased to Port Authority.
But since the broad outlines of a deal were first proposed, many said a simple swap would be out of sync with the realities of politics, budget projections and business. Mr. Bloomberg insists that the city retain some influence over how the two Queens airports are operated, and others at City Hall say the Port Authority must ante up cash, as well as land, to compensate the city for the income it would forgo in future airport lease payments.
It was unclear yesterday whether Governor McGreevey's reference to a "significant difference in the allocated worth" of land under the airports and at ground zero was based on negotiations already taking place. 
One official close to Mayor Bloomberg, who spoke on condition that he not be identified, said last night that Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development, had discussed the deal at City Hall two weeks ago with Joseph J. Seymour, the executive director of the Port Authority; that the two men had continued their talks in several telephone conversations; and that detailed financial questions are certain to have come up. 
"You never know, but what Governor McGreevey said today may mean he is negotiating in public," said the city official.
Mr. McGreevey's initial response to the swap proposal was favorable. He "is amenable to the idea," said Paul Aronsohn, a spokesman for Mr. McGreevey, on Aug. 5.
Edward Skyler, a spokesman for Mayor Bloomberg, said yesterday that officials at City Hall did not construe Mr. McGreevey's remarks as a serious obstacle to negotiations.
"He did say something about ongoing consideration," said Mr. Skyler, paraphrasing the New Jersey governor. "Our position is that we will have productive conversations, and take one step at a time."
Mr. Pataki, who was with Mr. McGreevey, also sought to frame the swap proposal in a positive light, but said it depended on City Hall's providing more detail on how the deal would be structured.
"We have yet to see a detailed proposal from the city," he said. "I know the city is working on that, and we're looking forward to getting it, and when we do we'll give it a thorough review."

George W.'s Worst Fear: A W-Shaped Recession

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 21 

 BODY:
When the economy entered an unmistakable slump last year, economists quickly began a lively and jargon-filled debate about whether a recovery would be U-shaped (mild and slow) or V-shaped (sharp and quick).
 But there was always a third possibility that would be especially painful for the White House: the W-shaped recession -- a double-dipped downturn. 
 The economics of it would be bad enough, but the perils of political parody would be even more nightmarish for President George W. Bush. The Dubya recession. The Dubya-dip downturn. 
It would be fresh meat for every late-night comedian, right on the eve of national elections in November that will decide which party controls Congress.
The Letterman-Leno-Jon Stewart potential for trouble was almost certainly on the minds of at least some White House staff members as they organized President Bush's feel-good economic forum last week. 
Though Mr. Bush paid solemn tribute to the anxieties and disruption that many voters are feeling, he and his top cabinet officers relentlessly drove home the message that things seemed to be getting better.
Is there a Dubya recession on the horizon? Probably not, in the view of most economic forecasters. But most also have a disturbing caveat for White House handicappers: the risks cannot be neglected.
If one is on the way, they add, there is not much that President Bush can do to stop it before the elections.
The United States has experienced only a few true W-shaped downturns in the last several decades. The most recent occurred from 1980 to 1982, when the economy was clawing back from a recession but was then hit hard by the relentless inflation-fighting policies of the Federal Reserve under Paul A. Volcker.
The situation today is almost the reverse. The Federal Reserve under Alan Greenspan is almost flooding the markets with money. Interest rates are at their lowest level in almost 40 years, and banks have channeled that cash into consumers' hands through low-cost home-equity loans and mortgages.
President Bush's tax cuts have nudged the economy as well, though many of those cuts will not take effect for several years.
"The risks have increased, but we are not in the double-dip camp," said William C. Dudley, chief United States economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company.
What worries economists as well as people in the Bush administration is that public confidence is shaky. After bouncing up at a very high annual rate of 5 percent in the first quarter, economic growth plunged back to 1.1 percent in the second three months of the year.
New corporate accounting scandals at Worldcom and other companies raised grave new doubts about much more widespread problems. The stock market dropped badly, erasing wealth and adding to anxiety. 
James Devine, a professor of economics at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, is among those who believe that a W-shaped recession is likely. He publicly raised the prospect of a "Dubya recession" last May.
"I haven't changed my mind," Professor Devine said, musing that he ought to stake out a copyright claim for a "Dubya Recession" in case it really does come to pass.
Mr. Devine contends that the American economy still faces what he said were the same "three bears" as before: high debt among businesses, high consumer debt and a very high external debt in the national balance of payments.
Perhaps surprisingly, Democrats running in tight races for Congress are generally not warning about a Dubya-dip. Instead, they are focusing on particular issues and votes that they contend expose the Republicans' vulnerabilities: tax breaks for the wealthy, privatizing Social Security and voting for the "fast-track" law that could lead to lower trade barriers against foreign imports. 
"What you don't want to do is capitalize on people's misery," said Jenny Backus, a spokeswoman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. "We are not counting on hard times, but if they are going to come, then it gives us an opportunity to use that in showing there is a difference in how Democrats and Republicans lead."
The late-night comedians have not yet played with the Dubya recession, but they are sharpening their scalpels. When President Bush held his economic forum in Waco, Tex., last week, Jay Leno remarked that Mr. Bush would do whatever it took to keep the economy strong -- "even if he must stay on vacation for three more months."

36 Hours Black Hills, S.D.

BYLINE:  By KARL CATES 

 BODY:
 AS western South Dakota rises gradually toward Wyoming, its seemingly endless expanse of wheat fields is broken abruptly by the Black Hills, a tangled maze of topographical features where Indians of the Great Plains battled Army troops in the 1870's. Today, grain-harvesting combines and razor-straight highways east of the Black Hills give way to a broken and wooded landscape laced with serpentine roads through pine forests and granite passes. There is more wildlife here than there is in some of the country's most famous national parks, but the area has somehow been spared the throngs of recreational vehicles and cars that choke roads in and around better-known places. The Black Hills cover a sizable corner of South Dakota, so putting some mileage on the odometer is part of the journey. This is not a trip for serious foodies, however: the local cuisine tends to be more chicken-fried steak than pan-seared scallops, so adjust your culinary expectations accordingly. KARL CATES 

Friday
7 p.m.

1. Familiar Faces
In Keystone, 23 miles south of Rapid City, Mount Rushmore National Memorial (off Highway 244; 605-574-2524; www.nps.gov/moru; $8 parking fee; open daily, 8 a.m. to 10 p.m.) looks just like it did when Cary Grant skittered across it in the 1959 movie "North by Northwest." What's new are the base facilities, vastly expanded in recent years. They include a new visitors' center, a museum and parking decks that make the attraction more accessible than it used to be. There's also a new hiking trail and added seating. The best way to put a fresh face on the place is to stay for the nightly lighting ceremony, which starts at 9 p.m. in the summertime and includes a short film on the four presidents carved in Mount Rushmore, a talk by a ranger and the playing of the national anthem.

Saturday
9 a.m.

2. High-Plains Warrior
The Powder House (24127 Highway 16A; 605-666-4646), a breakfast spot just north of Keystone with log cabin ambience, opens at 7 a.m. If you're closer to Custer, try the Wheels West 7th Cavalry Cafe three miles east of town (Highway 16A; 605-673-2570), a homey restaurant that serves breakfast all day. After breakfast, head for the Crazy Horse Memorial (605-673-4681; www.crazy horse.org; admission is $9 per adult or $19 per car; children under 6 get in free), 17 miles southwest of Mount Rushmore on Highway 16/385. Work on the sculpture, promoted as the world's largest, has been in progress since 1948 and has a long way to go before it's done. (Mount Rushmore took a mere 14 years to complete.) Even incomplete, the Crazy Horse Memorial has a forceful (and enormous) presence, with the striking visage of a warrior on horseback and the outline of an extended arm pointing across the vast lost lands of the Sioux. The sculpture, carved out of a mountain, will eventually stand 564 feet tall, and crews continue blasting and moving rock daily. Following the model that the sculptor Korczak Ziolkowski envisioned before his death in 1982, his family helps run a nonprofit foundation that keeps the work going. At the base of the memorial, the Indian Museum of North America is open daily.

11 a.m.
3. The Needles Highway

Few drives are as enjoyable as Highway 87 off Highway 16 just north of the Crazy Horse Memorial, twisting and turning through a series of switchbacks and hairpin curves as it winds through rugged country and dense forests. Strictly speaking, the Needles Highway doesn't begin until after the Sylvan Lake Resort, but the crooked seven-mile drive up to the lodge is straight out of a car commercial. In places, the road narrows abruptly to one lane as it crosses bridges. It also squeezes (barely) through tunnels blasted out of granite, and brushes up against the rock formations the Needles Highway is named for. Heed the oncoming traffic and keep your limbs in the car. Before starting down the Needles portion, it's not a bad idea to pull over and take a breather at the Sylvan Lake Resort.

Noon
4. The Pit Stop

The lodge at the Sylvan Lake Resort, at the intersection of Highways 87 and 89 (605-574-2561; www.custerresorts.com; open May to late September), seven miles above the junction with Highway 16, is an unprepossessing stone and timber hotel operated by Custer State Park. Its greatest claim to fame is its unobstructed view of Harney Peak, at 7,242 feet the highest point between the Rocky Mountains and the Swiss Alps, as the locals say. What the lodge lacks in glamour it makes up for in rusticity. Deer wander through the shady forest around the lodge, and a tangle of granite boulders and outcroppings make for an unusual walk. If it's a nice day, the patio of the Lakota Dining Room is the place for lunch. The food isn't fancy, but some of it is original: buffalo stew is $4.79 a bowl, the buffalo burger is $6.99, and brown-bag picnics are $6 to $8.

3 p.m.
5. Big Game

As animal sightings go, the 18-mile-long Wildlife Loop Road through Custer State Park (605-255-4515; www.custerstatepark.info; admission is $5 per person or $12 per car), a few miles via Highway 16A from the eastern end of the Needles Highway, is comparable to Yellowstone National Park. The road bisects a carefully nurtured game preserve of unfenced meadows that attract herds of buffalo and sprawling colonies of prairie dogs. Sightings of coyote, bighorn sheep and mountain goats are also common. In certain spots, droves of wild donkeys surround tourists, begging for handouts. Watch the teeth, and don't walk or stand behind the animals, as they are temperamental and capable of throwing a lethal kick.

5 p.m.
6. To the Tower

A left turn onto Highway 87 at the western exit of Wildlife Loop Road leads to a trail head in Wind Cave National Park, five miles south, that goes to the Rankin Ridge Lookout. The highway turnoff is marked, and it goes to a parking lot where the trail starts (two miles round trip). Signs warn that buffalo can be dangerous, though there aren't many in the immediate vicinity. The 30-minute hike is uphill, and mildly strenuous. It ends at a 70-foot-tall tower used until 1998 as a lookout station for forest fires. Today it serves mostly as a windblown vista for hikers, though visitors often encounter no one else. Bad weather can materialize quickly; out of respect for lightning, abandon the ridge when a storm arrives. The town of Hot Springs is 13 miles south.

Sunday
10 a.m.
7. Therapy for the Road-Weary

In Hot Springs, grab a quick breakfast at Dale's Family Restaurant (745 Battle Mountain Avenue; 605-745-3028), and then head to the Springs Bath House (146 North Garden Street; 888-817-1972; www.springs bathhouse.com; hours vary seasonally), a surprisingly elaborate indulgence for so small a town. The bathhouse, clean and well ordered, taps into the 102-degree waters that bubble up from underground. New Age music and aromatherapy are part of the deal. Packages are tailored to almost any request. Massages start at $40, and an all-day soak pass in the outdoor spring-fed pool costs $8. There's a long list of exotic amenities, like the Mediterranean sugar scrub ($45) and the seaweed body mask ($65). Call ahead for an appointment.

THE BASICS
Visiting the Black Hills
The town of Keystone, the locus of Black Hills tourism, is 16 miles southeast of Rapid City via Highway 16, off Interstate 90. Connecting flights on United and Northwest Airlines, from Denver and Minneapolis, serve the Rapid City Regional Airport. Keystone, just east of Mount Rushmore, is a tourist-geared strip with numerous fast-food restaurants and reasonably priced motels like the Econo Lodge (908 Madill Street; 877-424-6423; $90 to $139) and the Best Western Four Presidents Lodge (24075 Highway 16A; 605-666-4472; $89-$139). In Hot Springs, another town best suited for travelers, the Toal House Bed and Breakfast (801 Almond Street; 888-881-4633; $90 to $130) sits atop a cliff overlooking the historic district.

HEADLINE: HAVENS; 
Weekender Red Hook, N.Y.

BYLINE:  By NANCY Q. KEEFE 

 BODY:
BROADWAY at Market Street in Red Hook looks like a poster for Main Street, U.S.A. Actually it is on a poster -- framed and on display in Billie's Family Restaurant a few steps away. The poster announced a 1986 conference that dealt with historic preservation, and Red Hook seems to have taken the concept to heart. The village center with its red-brick storefronts, 90 miles up the Hudson Valley from New York, still has the feel of a Norman Rockwell painting. 
 Billie's is an old-time luncheonette, with counter stools and tables, and a kind of icon of the village. It has an outdoor cafe where people linger. At Broadway and Market, traditional-looking buildings on three corners accommodate small stores. A thoroughly modern-looking gas station sprawls across the fourth corner, but the balance seems about right -- Red Hook as three-quarters nostalgia and one-quarter 21st century. 
 Whatever the proportion, people want to be in Red Hook -- the villages of Red Hook and Tivoli and the hamlet of Annandale-on-Hudson are all part of the larger Town of Red Hook, total population 10,408. Patrick Flood, a sales associate at Prudential Serls Prime Properties, said demand for houses is high and half of the customers he deals with are looking for second homes. They are drawn to the Hudson Valley landscape with views of the river, the Catskills and a stretch of riverfront estates. 

Red and Green on the Hudson
According to the town's Web site, Red Hook got its name when early Dutch navigators charting the river came upon Cruger's Island -- actually a peninsula or "hoek" -- when it was turning red in autumn. Later visitors found the town's rich farmland and settled in.
Red Hook village has a variety of houses and stores, and some restaurants offer food cooked by graduates of the Culinary Institute of America, down the road in Hyde Park.
Scenic Hudson, a preservation group, bought development rights to about 16 percent of the town's farmland in 1998, ensuring a future with open vistas. But many farms have been divided, and finding country property to buy is not difficult. 
Neighbors can shop for produce and pick their own fruits and vegetables at Greig Farm, on Pitcher Lane west of Route 9, or sample wines at Alison Wines and Vineyards close by. Ric Lewit, who planted the vines and named the place for his wife, bought the land from the Greig family four years ago. Alison is one of four wineries on the Dutchess wine trail, the center of the Hudson Valley Wine Fest planned for Sept. 14 and 15.
Another side of Red Hook is its riverfront, cut off from much of the town by railroad tracks. At Tivoli, on the banks of the Hudson in the northwest corner of the town, you can cross the tracks to cast fishing lines or launch a kayak. 
More scenic and easier to get to is Poets' Walk, a 120-acre park just north of the Kingston-Rhinecliff Bridge on River Road. It has hiking trails, picnic places, vistas for landscape artists, and cross-country skiing. Montgomery Place on Annandale Road, built from 1802 to 1805, is one of several river estates open for tours and walks. 
Red Hook is also a college town. Bard College, in Annandale-on-Hudson, offers a summer music festival. A performing arts center under construction on the campus was designed by the architect Frank Gehry and incorporates his signature undulating curves in a stainless-steel roof. 
In Tivoli is the Kaatsbaan International Dance Center, where students and touring companies can stay for a few weeks or a season.

Buying In
Earlier this year, a small, 25-year-old fixer-upper on a side street off Broadway in Red Hook village went on the market for $200,000 and was bid up to $250,000 before it sold, said Kevin Bathrick, the owner of Mountain View Builders, who specializes in housing construction and watches the real estate market. Long-term residents have mixed feelings about the demand that is pushing prices up. Paul Fredricks of Apple Realty welcomes the business -- telecommuters, new permanent residents, weekenders -- but notes: "People of limited means can't afford to stay in the village. It's a kind of economic cleansing." 
Last week a house with a 14-by-28-foot living room and cathedral ceiling was available in Red Hook village for $199,000, and a three-bedroom town house with a deck overlooking the Red Hook golf course was listed at $259,000. In the country, a two-story house on two acres was $249,000.

Getting There
Red Hook is about about a two-hour drive from Manhattan by car. Take the Taconic Parkway to the Red Hook exit, Route 199 West. About four miles along, at a fork in the road, a huge metal dinner fork (the contribution of Stephen Schreiber, an art lover who lives nearby) sticks in the ground. Smile, bear right and go about three more miles. You have arrived when you see street signs with a bright red hook that looks like an upside-down question mark.

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW; 
Tombs, Pop Tarts And Parties

BYLINE:  By HOLLAND COTTER 

 BODY:
I LOVE this time of year in New England. Fall asters are dusting the roadsides, but everyone's still at the beach. Intimations of mortality meet the Endless Summer. Great. Art museums don't take vacations, which is also great because several in and around Boston are having their strongest exhibitions of the year so far.
 The Arthur M. Sackler Museum at Harvard University is one, with a fabulous display of ancient Chinese tomb sculpture. North of Boston at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Portland, Me., a survey of work by the maverick American artist William Pope.L has opened, despite a thumbs-down on funds from the uptight National Endowment for the Arts. In Boston itself, the Museum of Fine Arts is serving up a tasty smorgasbord of pre-to-post-Pop work, which isn't exactly breaking news but offers plenty of food for thought. 
 What, if anything, do the three exhibitions have in common? Each is about the overlap of art and life, matter and spirit, high and low culture. Together they touch on human experience from cradle to grave. And they ask us, in their very different ways, to ponder where we come from, where we are and where we're headed, which is sort of art's job. 
What if you believed -- possibly you do -- that death isn't the end of life as we know it, but instead an existential version of changing houses, a shift from this here-and-now to an identical but permanent one elsewhere? Who would you want to have with you in the big move? Close family and amusing friends, for sure, but in addition maybe your lawyer, your personal trainer, your pets, the enforcers and protectors you count on to take the practical snarls out of daily existence and the kinks out of your psyche?
The ancient Chinese envisioned the afterlife in such a way, and those who had wealth and power took every precaution to provide themselves with a stimulating, well-staffed eternal retirement. You can see their plans in operation at the Sackler in "From Court to Caravan: Chinese Tomb Sculptures From the Collection of Anthony M. Solomon," which includes 55 ceramic figures made for mortuary use.
Organized by Robert D. Mowry, the museum's curator of Chinese art, the exhibition is a winner: the size is right, the installation impeccable, the catalog by Virginia L. Bower a model of scholarly hunting and gathering. And thanks to Mr. Solomon, an economist, collector and sculptor now in his 90's, the material itself is superb.
Mr. Solomon started buying only in 1988, but he set his sights in a rewarding direction. He saw that the richly glazed tomb figures of the Tang dynasty (A.D. 618 to 906) were avidly sought after, so he focused on something else: ceramics colored with unfired pigment in a technique known as cold painting. To his eye, the absence of glazing allows the sculptural form to shine through, and he's right. The purse-lipped beauties, somber court officials and huffing-and-puffing Buddhist-style guardians that inhabit the Sackler these days have a wonderful physical warmth and immediacy.
They also cover a good stretch of history, about a millennium, much of which consisted of the so-called Period of Disunity, when numerous competing dynasties rose and fell. The objects from this time, in dynamic and still largely unfamiliar styles, are the revelations of the show.
Tomb figures probably originated as surrogates for human sacrifices in the deep, dark past. The earliest pieces on view date from the Han dynasty (206 B.C. to A.D. 220), when the notion of the grave as a house was well developed. House meant home, which in turn meant activity. So it's no surprise that while a demure attendant in the first gallery sets a mood of domestic decorum, two figures nearby seem to be in party mode.
One of them, a woman in a vermilion-trimmed robe, raises her hands to strike a drum; with her dotlike eyes and Little Lulu eyebrows, you know she's intent on making serious noise. The drum itself is perched on the head of the second figure, a curious being who is either a hybrid of man and bird or a prankish entertainer wearing a beaked mask.
The ambiguous play of real and fantastic is one of the chief attractions of Chinese funerary sculptures. Another is their expressive range, especially remarkable considering that the figures were produced in bulk from molds, then touched up by hand. The artisanal, mass-produced nature of such images, plus their association with death and its pollutions, long caused them to be held in low esteem in China itself. Until fairly recently, in fact, they weren't considered art in the Western sense.
But what an amazing, anything-can-happen universe they reveal: one of self-effacing servants and flamboyant deities, barnyard animals and magical beasts, deep-rooted traditions and multicultural exoticisms. The worldview represented is thoroughly elitist; even the "little people" depicted ranked fairly high on the scale of privilege. But all the tomb figures at the Sackler fulfill their appointed task: they have preserved "forever" a particular way of life, in reality long since past, and kept its beauties and its flaws, its consuming appetite and psychological denial, intact. ("From Court to Caravan" travels to the Asia Society in Manhattan this fall.)

Museum of Fine Arts
For another spectacular blurring of reality and fantasy, consider postwar American art, generous chunks of which are on view in "Jasper Johns to Jeff Koons: Four Decades of Art From the Broad Collection" at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.
Based in Los Angeles, Eli and Edythe Broad (pronounced BRODE) have been buying contemporary art for nearly 40 years, but they did their heaviest shopping in the 1980's. They favor painting or photography that looks like painting (notably, Cindy Sherman's). And figurative work is definitely their thing, which means that, once past three vintage Cy Twomblys, fans of abstraction may feel a bit deprived.
The exhibition organizers, Stephanie Barron and Lynn Zelevansky, curators at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, have on the whole avoided a one-entry-per-artist collection overview, and that was smart. The artists represented by one or two pieces -- Eric Fischl, Susan Rothenberg, David Salle -- don't look so hot, while those presented in depth really do.
A group of 10 beaming Roy Lichtenstein paintings, for example, dating from 1962 to 1990, light up a room. Witty and elegant, they distill a classic Pop sensibility but in rarefied, squeaky-clean form, free of the fast-food odors, slippery emotions and slicing moral ambivalence that characterize the movement more generally. For these qualities, you can look to Andy Warhol's smeary Marilyn and Elvis altarpieces, and to Ms. Sherman, who, despite her Conceptual credentials and the fact that she was barely in her teens in the 1960's, has always seemed Pop-ish to me. Platinum blond bombshells abound in her 1970's "Film Stills" series; in photographs from the 1990's, the human form is reduced to a puddle of horror-movie gunk, which bears a vague resemblance to school-lunch chili. The artist Robert Indiana once did paintings of the words "Eat" and "Die." They aren't in the show, but they catch the night side of Pop in a nutshell.
Occupying turf on either side of the core Pop sensibility are the two artists who open and close the exhibition, Jasper Johns and Jeff Koons. Both receive considerable attention, and they deserve it. Mr. Johns has spent a career creating visual enigmas of a passive-aggressive kind. Intensively wrought, his early paintings look good enough to eat, but they send out complicated, toxic vibes.
This is true of his "White Flag" (1960). Here a familiar political emblem is smothered in creamy strokes of white oil paint on newspaper, to toothsome effect. But it soon becomes evident that the image beneath the icing is oozing fluid around the edges and letting scraps of type, like secret messages, show through from underneath. Mr. John's white confection is, like Miss Havisham's wedding cake, the relic of a dead sweetness, an enbalmed past.
Mr. Koons's most recent art looks confectionary, too, but not in the same way. It's all frosty shapes and smiley colors, sugar and spice, nitrates and chemical dyes. A much-seen early sculpture, "Three-Ball 50/50 Tank" (1985), with its basketballs floating in a half-filled aquarium, feels curiously austere in this context, a reminder of what a lean, succinct formalist Mr. Koons can be.
But his 1986 "Rabbit," a stainless steel cast of an inflatable rubber bunny, fits right in. Its polished surface reflects the other Koons works in the gallery: a life-size, implicitly racist ceramic statue of Michael Jackson, a James Rosenquistian painting titled "Party Hat," and a colossal cast plastic version of a winsome kitty, which I take to be based on a refrigerator magnet.
For some reason it all jells. Mr. Koons's ideas, like Mr. Johns's, skip around constantly and never land in the same place twice. That's why mini-survey installations of their art, like those in Boston, appear to be group shows. But if Mr. Johns's eclectic painting feels like a fixated, weirdly erotic attempt to embalm a disintegrating psychic and cultural past, Mr. Koons's work comes across as a brash, extroverted salute to a non-biodegradable present in which consumption, pleasure and affectless sentimentality are embraced with an enthusiasm that feels at once infantile and pornographic.
In interviews, Mr. Koons has suggested that he really likes this present, this global capitalist nirvana, or maybe he likes the idea of now as a state of being. I only half-believe him, but that's just me. In any case, he's currently at midcareer, hard at work, and still unpredictable, which is good. Who knows? He may still produce the Exploding Plastic Inevitable that will give art in the 21st century a boot in the pants. I hope he does. I hope someone does. (Recent paintings by Mr. Koons are on view at the Guggenheim Museum in New York through Sept. 2.)

In Portland
Eating. Emptiness. Childhood. Pleasure. These, and their opposites, are the active ingredients in the art of another midcareer artist, William Pope.L, the subject of an unorthodox survey titled "eRacism" at the Institute of Contemporary Art, part of the Maine College of Art in Portland.
Mr. Pope.L -- this is the name his parents gave him, the combination of his father's last name and the first initial of his mother's maiden name, Lancaster -- has been an underground presence in the art world since the late 1970's. Now 47, he is known primarily as a performance artist but is active in various media, visual and literary. Several of them figure in a gutsy, stimulating exhibition that combines autobiography, political anger and absurdist humor in equal measure.
As to autobiography, Mr. Pope.L was born poor in Newark. His family, to whom he remains close, was hit hard by alcoholism and drug addiction. His mother was briefly jailed when he was in his teens. He did graduate work at Rutgers University, where he studied with the Fluxus artists Geoffrey Hendricks and Robert Watts. He teaches at Bates College in Lewiston, Me. Much of his output is about creating something substantial but complex and unpin-downable -- a life, a viable ego, an art -- out of having nothing or very little.
The resulting work is full of ideas but materially ephemeral. Several pieces in the exhibition are made from foods he ate as a child, cheap processed fillers spiked with preservatives to guarantee a long shelf life. Dozens of racist cartoons are drawn on a wall frieze of Pop Tarts. A mural of a sexually ambiguous figure giving birth is executed in peanut butter. A cagelike installation titled "Party Room," first done at the Project in Harlem last year, has walls made from bottles of Wild Irish Rose, a rot-gut street wine marketed with a ghetto clientele in mind. In this case, balanced on top of each bottle as if impaled, is a child's stuffed animal, tagged and numbered like a corpse in a morgue.
Issues of social class and race -- that biological myth turned into a cultural reality -- are central to Mr. Pope.L's art. They appear as repeated symbolic pairings of whiteness and blackness, of fullness and emptiness, dualities that he alternately teases and tears apart as if to demonstrate how arbitrary they are and how deeply entrenched.
His work with these concepts comes across with particular urgency and elan in his performances, which can be seen in documentary clips playing in the gallery. They're the highlight and core of the exhibition; they make everything else make sense. In one, Mr. Pope.L meditatively reads and then chews an issue of The Wall Street Journal, as if to digest its insider information. In another he tries to pass out money in front of a Manhattan bank, momentarily turning passers-by into panhandlers.
In a third, he crawls on his belly through the streets of the East Village in a business suit, viewing the world from the vantage point of the homeless, a self-punishing gesture he has performed many times in many places, most recently in the Whitney Biennial. In a few taped gallery appearances, he reveals himself to be both a deft stand-up comic and an actor and writer of withering power. The performance clips amount to around two hours of viewing time. I wouldn't have missed a minute.
Organized by Mark H. C. Bessire, director of the Institute of Contemporary Art; Stuart Horodner of the Portland Institute of Contemporary Art in Oregon; and Sara Kellner and Diane Barber of DiverseWorks Artspace in Houston, "eRacism" will appear at Artists Space in Manhattan in 2004. It comes with a splendid book published by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Press titled "William Pope.L: The Friendliest Black Artist in America." Even more than the show itself, it confirms this artist as an important, poetic and utterly uncategorizable contemporary voice.

Art Complex, Duxbury
For Boston visitors, I have two more exhibitions to recommend, the first of them at the Art Complex Museum in Duxbury, a small, privately financed institution in an old South Shore town not far from the sea. The museum was built in 1971 by Edith and Carl A. Weyerhaeuser to house their own collection, which embraced old master prints, Shaker furniture and Asian art.
The museum, now under the direction of Charles Weyerhaeuser, the founder's son, is reviewing and conserving portions of its holdings. Among those recently examined was a group of Indian miniature paintings and drawings, and they've been put on view this summer.
Organized by Alice R. M. Hyland, consulting curator, and Catherine Mayes, senior curator at the museum, the exhibition has fine things, including illuminated pages from a 15th-century Jain manuscript and 17th-century Rajasthani paintings. Best of all is an exceptionally beautiful 18th-century narrative from the hill kingdom of Guler, which depicts the blue-skinned baby Krishna at home with his family. Two astrologers are in the process of calculating the infant god's future; a herd of exquisitely painted cows stand outside the door, as if eagerly waiting to hear the news.
The museum has supplemented this display with contributions by five contemporary artists who either were born in India or have spent time there: Ambreen Butt, Sukanya Rahman, John La Vertu, Pamela Murphy and Pamela Singh. They're all of interest, with Ms. Singh's paintings of Tantric designs on enlarged photographs a standout. The joint shows are an inspired idea. Each is well done; the museum itself is a gem.

Gardner Museum
So, it hardly needs saying, is the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, which is offering a modest display of sculptural jewelry by the German-born Manfred Bischoff, a recent artist in residence. Mr. Bischoff based one of his tiny, abstract gold and coral forms on a fresco of Hercules by Piero della Francesca, a work the museum owns.
And the fact is, the reason to go to the Gardner is, as aways, the Gardner itself, a Venetian-style palazzo with its damask-walled rooms, its paintings by Piero, Titian, Rembrandt and Fra Angelo and its filtered light, all perfumed by the scent of flowers, which change with the seasons in the courtyard garden.
When Mrs. Gardner -- no Bostonian would dream of calling her Isabella -- died in 1924, she bequeathed the museum that had been her home to the city on the condition that it remain intact and unchanged, with no object taken from or added to the collection, and nothing shifted -- not a chair, not a vase -- within the rooms themselves.
Her wish has not always been scrupulously honored. Nearly a dozen years ago thieves made off with some of her finest paintings, including a priceless Vermeer. More recently a few works have been discreetly sent out on loan. But on the whole the museum, which celebrates its 100th anniversary in January, remains what it was meant to be: a celebration of period taste, patrician comfort, conspicuous consumption and -- the nobles of ancient China would understand this perfectly -- a monument to life without end.

HEADLINE: DRIVING; 
S.U.V. Haters Pitch a Curbside Battle

BYLINE:  By AARON DONOVAN 

 BODY:
WITH people crowding the sidewalks and music from clubs and cars in the air, it was the kind of summer night in Greenwich Village when energy seems to emanate from the pavement. Joseph Edmonds, in a dark baseball cap and a white polo shirt, might have been looking for the right nightclub. Instead, he was studying the rows of parked cars.
 Halfway down the block from a busy corner, he spotted one that towered above the others, its shiny gray paint reflecting light from the streetlamp overhead. "I'm going to get that Excursion down there," he told Renee Benson, a young woman who was scanning the curbsides with him. 
 "Please do," she replied.
He walked to the car and, from a stack in his hand, took out a card colored the bright orange of a New York City parking ticket and imprinted with the word "violation." He slipped it under the windshield wiper. 
The owner of the car was in for a bout of that stomach-dropping feeling that accompanies the discovery of a ticket. But Mr. Edmonds and Ms. Benson, friends in their 20's, are not with the Police Department. The card was a message from people who hate sport utility vehicles, and the "violation" was owning one.
"Did you get excited when you saw that ad for an S.U.V. in the remote wilderness?" the text on the fake ticket read. "Did you want to sue the manufacturer for false advertising when you started driving it to the shopping center instead?" It went on -- at some length -- to castigate S.U.V.'s for their gasoholic tendencies and S.U.V. drivers for buying them.
"Think about it!" the flier said. "Why do you need such a HUGE car? This is not a militarized zone!" It accused the driver of "polluting more than your fair share."
Challenging the owners of S.U.V.'s isn't new. In Manhattan, vigilantes have been putting crude fliers trumpeting accusations like "Your car is a killer" on S.U.V.'s for at least two years, and in Brooklyn, a magazine editor organized a protest in which a number of "No S.U.V. Parking" signs were placed on a street last December.
But the phenomenon appears to be growing in size and intensity. Mr. Edmonds and Ms. Benson were working with Earth on Empty, a group concerned about air pollution and global warming that has begun distributing professionally designed and mass-produced ticket look-alikes in a score of states.
Trying a different tactic, two women let the air out of the tires of S.U.V.'s parked at Johnson Ford, a dealership in Kingston, N.Y., last year. This month the were sentenced to 50 hours each of community service.
"There are many of us at the dealership who are environmentally aware," said Vincent Martello, the marketing manager of the Johnson Auto Group, which owns the dealership. "I just think that the strategy that they chose was not an effective one."
Some responses to anti-S.U.V. activism are less restrained. In Greenwich Village, Mr. Edmonds and Ms. Benson didn't wait around to see their victims' reactions, but it's a safe bet they were not warm ones. What the protesters see as activism looks to some on the receiving end like harassment.
"We get really, really nasty e-mails all the time," said John, a founder of Earth on Empty who monitors messages to the group's Web site, www.earthonempty .com. The Web address is printed plainly on the phony tickets.
John, who lives in Cambridge, Mass., would give only his first name because, he said, he has been receiving hostile phone calls from people who have somehow found out about his anti-S.U.V. work. But he did share a sampling of the e-mail messages. In just a dozen of them, S.U.V. proponents called Earth on Empty members tree-huggers, time-wasters, socialists, elitists, litterers, blue-collar workers, freedom-removers, leftists, losers, homosexuals, Democrats and filthy people. And those were the printable epithets.
John himself once met an S.U.V. owner face to face while he was ticketing. The owner and his girlfriend were inside, but not visible from a distance. The owner got out and chased John away from the car, shouting profanities. The group advises its helpers not to give out the tickets before 10 p.m. and not to confront drivers.
The sneak-and-strike policy may be prudent, but it leaves some of the S.U.V. owners incensed. "I don't want to say it's cowardly, but it's leaving something and running," said Darren Thayer, 29, whose Ford Explorer was ticketed in Cape Elizabeth, Me., on Aug. 3.
Christina Allen, 18, who was with her boyfriend when his '88 Jeep Cherokee was ticketed this month in a Wal-Mart parking lot in Eagan, Minn., said they both thought at first that the flier was a real parking ticket. "Once we figured out what it was," she said, "we were really mad."
The thrust of the Earth on Empty message is about fuel economy. But some of the ticketers have other concerns. Candice Manson, 23, another New York activist, hates being trapped behind outsize cars when she's on the road herself. "When you're stuck in traffic behind an S.U.V.," she said, "you don't know why you're stuck in traffic."
John, who runs the Earth on Empty Web site, says the group wants to stigmatize S.U.V. owners the way militant animal lovers have stigmatized women who wear fur coats.
In Greenwich Village, Ms. Benson and Mr. Edmonds cast their net widely; they ticketed a Toyota RAV4, a small S.U.V. that gets 22 to 31 miles per gallon. But Earth on Empty officially advises "Go for the monsters!"
It hands out a guide listing 14 of the "hugest S.U.V.'s": the Cadillac Escalade, GMC Denali, Land Rover Range Rover, Ford Excursion and Expedition, Toyota Land Cruiser and Sequoia, Lincoln Navigator, Mercedes M-Class, Dodge Durango, Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban, Mercury Mountaineer and Lexus LS 470.
In general, the ticketers are proudest when they snag the big fish. "I like the Excursions because they're so huge for no reason," Mr. Edmonds said. And when Ms. Manson spotted a stretch limousine made from a Navigator, she gave it two tickets.
The stretch may be hard to justify, but many drivers who send e-mail messages to Earth on Empty's Web site are quick to defend their S.U.V.'s.
"We are a family of six with three dogs, often driving eight," one wrote. "What else should we drive? Three cars?"
Another wrote, "We have a home in the country, and the dirt roads can be hard to drive on, especially in the winter and mud season."
One man told a sobering story. "You have no idea why I drive the vehicle I have," his message said. "Maybe, just maybe, it's because my wife and myself have lost a son in an accident and want my family to be safe. Try losing a child."
But in at least one case, an Earth on Empty flier brought about a conversion. Janice Gilmer, 50, a massage therapist from the Upper West Side, said that when she read the fake ticket left on her Nissan Pathfinder, she had a moment of epiphany.
"I never would have bought my S.U.V. if I had any idea about the pollution and the waste of gas and unnecessary size and strength of it," she said. "I've never put it in four-wheel-drive once."

HEADLINE: Claims Filed By Jobless Are Off a Bit 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 22 

 BODY:
The number of newly laid-off workers filing claims for unemployment benefits declined slightly last week, the Labor Department reported today, indicating there was a modest improvement in the job market. 
 New applications for jobless benefits, the department said, totaled 389,000 last week, down 2,000 from the previous week, when benefits posted a gain of 9,000. 
 The four-week moving average for claims, a measure intended to smooth out weekly fluctuations, rose by 5,750, to 388,250. But the figure remained below 400,000 for the 10th week, the longest such stretch since the recession began in March of last year. 
In another indication of a slowly improving labor market, the number of unemployed workers who are continuing to draw jobless benefits totaled 3.52 million for the week ended Aug. 10, a slight decrease from the previous week. The figure hit a high of 3.83 million in May. 
The weekly and monthly jobless reports have been closely watched by economists, who are trying to detect the course of the recovery, which so far has generated little job growth.
The unemployment rate for July remained at 5.9 percent, with 6,000 new jobs created during the month as businesses, suffering the effects of various corporate accounting scandals and the steep decline in the stock market, were reluctant to hire new workers. 
Many economists think the jobless rate will top 6 percent as the weak recovery continues to depress job growth. While most analysts think a double-dip recession is a remote possibility, they warn that the odds would increase if the recent accounting scandals and bankruptcies produce another big wave of layoffs. 
Many analysts have cut their growth forecasts for the second half of the year based on the drop in the stock market this summer. 
But most economists are still predicting that the gross domestic product, the total output of goods and services, will increase at an annual rate of 2.5 percent in the last six months of this year with even stronger growth in 2003.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS; 
Software Makers Give the Recent Rally Another Bounce

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks rose yesterday, with the Dow Jones industrial average piercing the 9,000 mark for the first time since early July, helped by expectations that Microsoft would benefit from more corporate technology spending.
 The market has shrugged off bad news in recent weeks, and traders said, its resilience has encouraged buying. 
 "The indexes are up between 15 and 20 percent in recent weeks; that's not uneventful," said Al Kugel, investment strategist at Stein Roe & Farnham. "It continues a sea change that took place two weeks ago." 
Concerns about corporate malfeasance have diminished, Mr. Kugel said, and buyers "think of themselves as bargain hunters, and every time the market is knocked down, they come in and lift it."
The Dow rose 96.41 points, or 1.08 percent, to 9,053.64. It has risen 20.19 percent from an intraday low of 7,532.66 on July 24, its lowest point so far in the bear market that began in early 2000.
The broad Standard & Poor's 500-stock index increased 13.34 points, or 1.41 percent, to 962.70, closing above the 950 level it had been testing for three days. The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index gained 13.70 points, or 0.97 percent, to 1,422.95. It was the Nasdaq's highest close since July 5.
Salomon Smith Barney raised its rating on Microsoft after a survey of technology buyers suggested that it would receive a lift from corporate spending. Microsoft rose 95 cents, to $53.23, or 1.8 percent. Among other software stocks that rose, Oracle gained 43 cents, or 4 percent, to $11.19, and Siebel Systems added 50 cents, or 5.3 percent, to $9.91.
Despite the rally from the July lows, Benjamin Pace, managing director of Deutsche Bank Private Banking, said that opinions were mixed about the strength of the economic rebound, and that the uncertainty could cap gains.
Still, investors largely shrugged off the latest economic data. The number of Americans seeking initial jobless benefits eased a slight 2,000 last week, the government said, and economists said that the overall number remained high enough to indicate that the labor market is struggling to recover.
Some investors questioned whether the recent rally would continue, given the worries over corporate America's profits and their quality.
"The rally over the last month was an oversold bounce," said Craig Cummins, a trader at Cantor Fitzgerald. "The oversold condition was caused by the accounting scandals and the questionable ethics of some board directors or C.E.O.'s, but it has already been priced in. Is this the beginning of the next 3,000-point move up on the Dow? No, I don't see it that way."
Martha Stewart was in the spotlight again yesterday after some investors, angry about accusations of corporate corruption and the drop in price of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia stock, sued Ms. Stewart and other company insiders. In the lawsuit, shareholders accuse the insiders of dumping stock ahead of news that Ms. Stewart was under investigation for her sale of ImClone Systems shares. Martha Stewart Living shares fell 32 cents, to $8.59.
Staples, the office supply chain, fell 95 cents, or 6 percent, to $15.07, after it said that it would acquire the European mail-order office-supply business of the French retailer Pinault-Printemps-Redoute for about $800 million.
Shares in the housewares retailer Williams-Sonoma fell after it cut its projections for the third quarter. The stock fell $1.65, or 6.1 percent, to $25.
In the bond market, Treasury prices dropped as investors dumped government debt for equities.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note increased to 4.31 percent from 4.20 percent on Wednesday. The price, which moves in the opposite direction, dropped 28/32, to 100 17/32.
The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond rose to 5.09 percent from 5.01 percent. Its price dropped 1 1/32, to 104 6/32.

A TV Preacher to Satisfy the Taste for Islam Lite

BYLINE:  By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, Aug. 20 

 BODY:
Abdullah Gymnastiar, this nation's most popular Islamic preacher, possesses the boyish good looks and eternal smile that send Indonesian women scrambling for invitations to join his television audience. Men come, too. 
 Everyone sits on mats on the studio floor, though the preacher is perched a little higher, on a cushion, dressed in a crisp white jacket and perfectly pressed sarong that play well to the cameras. 
 He is taping six back-to-back shows, which will reach into living rooms, beauty shops and sidewalk cafes in this hyperactive city of 13 million people, where he is best known. Unlike religious leaders who recite repetitious Koranic verses, Mr. Gymnastiar, 40 years old and known as Gym (with a hard G), offers chirpy practical advice. He is up front about the personal issues on the soap operas that his program competes with. 
"Should a woman have sex in the office?" asks one woman. Mixing English and Indonesian words for a flirtatious effect, he replies, "A good sexy woman doesn't show off to others, just to her husband."
For those who say Indonesians wear their religion lightly and are profoundly moderate in their practice of Islam, the emergence of Mr. Gymnastiar in the last several years is proof enough. 
He attracts overflowing crowds to the Istiqlal mosque in Jakarta, the largest in Southeast Asia. President Megawati Sukarnoputri, who runs the world's most populous Islamic country but whose Islamic credentials are sometimes questioned, has invited him to appear alongside her at big outdoor events. Earlier this month, the American Embassy included him in a small group of Islamic leaders -- all of them moderate, but most of them older -- to meet Secretary of State Colin L. Powell. 
In his sermons and television programs, Mr. Gymnastiar often uses the word adil, meaning fair. It is, he says, the essence of Islam. 
"In Christianity the significant word is love," he said. "But in Islam it is fair. Because if we are not fair, we hurt someone. If we make war, we have to be fair with our enemy."
He tried, he said, to get this concept across to Secretary Powell. Most important, he said in an interview afterward, he tried to explain why the United States is mistrusted in the Islamic world. 
"I said: 'You don't look fair. I feel so sad that America looks too powerful,' " Mr. Gymnastiar said he told the secretary. He then drove the point home, he said, with the Middle East: "Why is it that Israel takes Palestinian land, and why is that the U.S. always helps this?" 
At the same time, he said, he tried to reassure Secretary Powell: "I said we don't hate America. I just said America is unjust, unfair. If Bush has a fair ideal, every country is going to love America. But as Muslims we feel we are treated unjustly, unequally." 
Mr. Gymnastiar's appeal among Indonesia's young and the middle class appears to lie in a combination of his modernity, his background as the son of a soldier and his interest in business. In the country's precarious economic environment, where an unruly democracy is unfolding after three decades of dictatorship, his homilies inspire hope and confidence.
"Success is how we can improve ourselves all our life," he said during a taping. "Don't think success is only money, a beautiful wife and a good job -- but how we can improve ourselves to the end of our life." 
At his base in Bandung, a city in West Java, he charges $100 for three-day motivational seminars on how to succeed. A local supermarket, a radio station and a variety of home industries opened by his organization are supposed to illustrate to the participants how to do better in their own businesses. 
Always mindful of the reach of his television audience, Mr. Gymnastiar had a waterfall built in the backyard of his modest home there, so the cameras could film him for special segments in front of an attractive backdrop.
Every Monday he gathers his senior staff of eight men, all under 40, on his veranda to plan the week's commercial activities.
His latest venture is "Al Quran Selular," a telephone service that allows subscribers to call daily to listen to their favorite texts from the Koran, recited in his deep voice. For several years, he has run charter flights to Mecca. 
"I like his knowledge," said Imaniza, 38, a fashion designer of what she called Muslim clothes. She had listened to his tapes and read his books at home before coming to the seminars. "He's not extreme. I've learned about entrepreneurship and human resources from him." 
With the exception of constantly upbraiding Indonesian leaders for being corrupt, Mr. Gymnastiar keeps politics out of his sermons. But, recently, he expressed harsh sentiments about the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, at the Istiqlal mosque. Afterward, a close friend and financial backer, Palgunadi Selyawan, a retired auto executive, said he scolded his protege for letting go of his emotions. 
But Mr. Gymnastiar is not afraid to say he has yet to see enough proof that Osama bin Laden was responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks. "There has to be to be a visible trial," he said. 
In a measure of the suspicions about the United States in Indonesia, he said he was reluctant to accept an invitation to travel to the United States. He was scheduled to go to Los Angeles just before Sept. 11. But now, a visit could send the wrong signal. He said, "I don't want to appear as someone groveling." 
In short, he said, his followers would not approve.

HEADLINE: A New Refinancing Boom in Mortgages 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
Months after the end of one big mortgage-refinancing boom, another is under way -- three years or more earlier than many lenders had expected.
 And like the previous one, this boom is likely to accelerate a shift toward 15-year mortgages because many investors think they can make more money by sinking money into their own houses than into a weak stock market. 
 Though 30-year home loans regained their popularity earlier this year as interest rates fell, many baby boomers are again seeing in 15-year loans the promise of paying off their mortgages before retirement without significantly increasing their monthly payments.
"Forget the stock market -- the equity's going to be in my house," said Lawrence A. Teplin, a podiatrist from Danville, Calif., who is about to refinance his mortgage for the second time this year. "I'm going to retire in 10 years." Dr. Teplin said he wanted to pay off his mortgage quickly and he had little in the way of consumer debt. 
Low rates have returned in large part because of the fear of a double-dip recession, or at least a prolonged period of slow economic growth. Most forecasters do not expect the Federal Reserve to resume raising short-term interest rates for many months, and so long-term rates have slipped downward again.
Late last year, with mortgage rates falling quickly, homeowners rushed to refinance. By lowering their monthly payments, they took back about $100 billion in household income, which may help explain robust consumer spending amid a slowing economy and slumping stock market.
It may be too early to tell how much this round of refinancing could help the economy, because some of these loans have not yet been paid out on the closing of the property sale and thus do not appear in official statistics.
Many consumers chose to refinance their 30-year mortgages with 15-year loans because with lower interest rates, their monthly payments remained more or less the same but more of each payment went toward repaying the principal. At Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, one of the biggest such lenders, 15-year mortgages rose in January to 33 percent of monthly business from 15 percent last August.
"There are a lot of people who see that they can keep their payments rather the same, and pay off their house sooner," said Robert A. Van Order, chief international economist at Freddie Mac, a government-sponsored buyer of mortgages.
Even with this trend, 30-year mortgages retained their popularity. Though interest rates on 15-year mortgages initially dropped further during the refinancing boom because of their shorter terms, the popularity of longer loans rebounded somewhat when 30-year rates closed the gap.
"As interest rates have gone down, a lot of people have opted to stick with a 30-year mortgage from the money-management standpoint," said Donald R. Rector, first vice president of Countrywide Home Loans, a leading mortgage lender. The market also swung back toward 30-year loans in recent months, he said, because consumers looking to reduce higher-interest debts like car loans and payments on credit cards were seeking the lowest possible monthly mortgage payment.
As rates slowly creep down even further, however, shorter-term loans appear to be staging a comeback. Bradley W. Blackwell, a national sales manager at Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, said that the popularity of 15-year loans was again rising.
"We're taking a huge number of applications today that will fund in August and September," Mr. Blackwell said. "The refinancing boom really kicked in in July."
Some experts, hypothesizing that most consumers who would refinance had done so already, have doubted the potential of a second refinancing boom. Yet despite the unusual size of the first boom, the second could be even bigger. Interest rates are lower now than they were last year. In the week ended yesterday, according to Freddie Mac, the average rate on a 30-year mortgage nationwide was 6.27 percent; a year earlier, it was 6.91 percent.
"We are having stronger activity than what we saw last fall," Mr. Blackwell said. "I did not expect this kind of refinancing activity to happen for another three to five years, but here we are. This thing appears to be a bottomless well."
Consumers' quick reactions to dips in interest rates may stem, at least in part, from changes in the refinancing process itself, Mr. Van Order said. "It's gotten easier to refinance in the past five years," he said. "People are a little quicker on the trigger than they used to be."
Dr. Teplin, the podiatrist, said that applying for his latest refinancing required only a 20-minute telephone call to the mortgage specialists who had arranged another loan in March. Then, he was shifting from a 30-year mortgage at 7.5 percent to a 15-year loan at a rate of 6.5 percent. Now, he is seeking a 15-year mortgage at 5.75 percent.
With monthly payments lowered by about $140, Dr. Teplin said he expected to pay off his closing costs, which he said would run $2,500 to $3,000, in about a year and a half. By making extra payments on the principal, he hopes to have the house paid for in 9 or 10 years, just in time for retirement.
Other baby boomers are getting similar ideas, said Douglas G. Duncan, chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association of America. Many, he said, carried 30-year mortgages and used the money saved by lower payments to invest in stocks.
Now they may be thinking twice. Skeptical of returns in the stock market, Mr. Duncan said, they may be reconsidering the idea of quick repayment of their mortgages.
The sharp fall in stock prices until about a month ago has been the leading factor in the minds of many homeowners who are taking advantage of low interest rates to switch to 15-year mortgages. Ralph P. Sita Jr., a certified public accountant in Greenbelt, Md., is getting ready to trade a 6.63 percent rate on a 15-year mortgage, which he recently obtained through refinancing, for 5.75 percent. He said he would save about $115 a month.
"With the interest rates going down, and less opportunity to invest it in good things, the best thing to do is to reduce your costs," Mr. Sita said. He added that he had been advising his clients to follow his lead.
Though refinancing activity and the shift to 15-year loans spiked and dropped again quickly last winter, the current boom could last longer because of the low interest rates, lenders said. Both Mr. Blackwell and Mr. Van Order predicted that mortgage rates would not rise significantly for several months.
Yet even a slight change in mortgage rates could accelerate the refinancing trend -- or kill it, Mr. Rector said. "It's a finely balanced thing that could go either way," he said. "If we see a rise in the cost for long-term financing, then the same driver that was driving consumers could take them the other way."
If mortgage rates fall further, consumers might have few qualms about refinancing -- even for a third time. "It boils down to human nature," Mr. Sita said. "If you can get a better deal on something, you take it."

HEADLINE: Chinatown Gentrifies, and Evicts; 
Complaints of Safety Violations Now Coming From Landlords

BYLINE:  By YILU ZHAO 

 BODY:
It had to happen eventually. Chinatown already spills over into two neighborhoods moving from modest to mod: Little Italy and the Lower East Side. And it is just a cellphone's throw from TriBeCa and SoHo. Gentrification was bound to come to Chinatown.
 Now that it has arrived, the neighborhood is experiencing the usual side effects, including landlords trying to evict longtime tenants who pay very little rent in favor of deep-pocketed bond traders. 
 But this time there is a twist. It seems that many of the Chinatown apartments that tenants are clinging to are illegal subdivisions, minuscule single rooms divided by little more than wooden boards. So when the landlord comes to evict these tenants, he can do so by wielding the city's building codes. 
From 200 to 400 families have been evicted from Chinatown every year in recent years, legal aid lawyers and social workers say. Many have moved to Chinese enclaves in Brooklyn or Queens. Some families have become homeless.
To many immigrant families, there is not much choice: either a tiny and squalid living space or nothing. "These apartments cause us a lot of headache," said Rosie Huang, a housing advocate and a counselor at University Settlement, a social service agency that works on the Lower East Side and in Chinatown. "This is a fire problem, a health problem and a sanitary problem. But if the government is going to evict people strictly according to the fire codes and health regulations, one-third of Chinatown will be gone."
"In the short term, having a piece of roof over your head is better than having none," she added. "But in the long run, we need more low-income housing to solve the crisis." 
There is little dispute that illegal spaces are all over Chinatown. In some cases, said a number of social workers, some immigrant tenants profited from cutting their rent-controlled or rent-stabilized one- and two-bedroom apartments into smaller units, and illegally renting them out to other families. Others say that in the 1980's, as huge waves of immigrants poured out from China, some Chinatown landlords divided single-family apartments themselves. 
But no matter who did the dividing, these illegal living quarters mean that many families share one kitchen and bathroom. The spaces, often partitioned into warrens with thin wooden boards, could be firetraps.
Now the building owners are courting city agencies to come inspect those longtime hazards.
This is what is happening at one building on Rutgers Street. Zongbo Zhou and his wife, Caizhu Tan, live in one of those tiny spaces, with wooden boards for walls. Mr. Zhou, a gaunt 82-year-old, once taught Chinese in elementary schools in rural Guangdong, China, then butchered chickens in Chinatown's live poultry market before retiring.
For 14 years, the couple paid $300 a month rent on a squeezed 150-square-foot room, with a full-size bed, a small table, a cupboard and a couple of chairs. But now their landlord wants them out. 
They say that the wooden partitions were erected before they moved in. At the end of last year, the landlord, Bao Li, called in the Fire Department to inspect the building's second floor. When the Fire Department found a violation, he evicted every tenant: 18 immigrants from China. Since then, Mr. Li has started to modernize those apartments. And he has told all tenants on the other floors to move out immediately.
"Why wasn't the landlord interested in the fire hazards five years ago?" mumbled Mr. Zhou, who is almost toothless. And, although he admits there is a danger from fire, his biggest worry is being thrown out: "Living in the streets is a lot more dangerous than living here."
The Department of Buildings does not spot-check for fire hazards in buildings. Instead, it waits for complaints to be filed.
"If the conditions are unsafe," said Ilyse Fink, the head spokeswoman for the department, referring to the subdivisions, "then the landlord has done the correct thing."
"But shame on the landlord," she said, "if he has known about the hazards for years and is turning to us only now."
Bao Li, the landlord on Rutgers Street, has filed a complaint with the State Supreme Court, claiming that the tenants are squatters illegally occupying his building. The tenants say that they have always paid rent, and that Mr. Li has even given them receipts from time to time.
John Gorman, a lawyer hired by Asian Americans for Equality, an immigrant advocacy group, to represent the remaining tenants in Mr. Zhou's building, said he planned to file a countersuit against Mr. Li for knowingly letting his tenants live in illegally subdivided spaces and frequently failing to provide heat and hot water. He will also ask the court to compel the landlord to erect fire-resistant walls between the units to make them legal apartments.
The telephone number listed for the landlord, Bao Li, has been disconnected. His lawyer, Mark Friedlander, declined to comment, saying, "I do not like litigating cases in newspapers." 
There have been at least three cases since 1987 in which judges required the landlords to convert illegal subdivisions into legal units for the current tenant. So there is a chance of winning an eviction case in court, social workers say, but very few tenants decide to try. Many, usually recent immigrants, are too frightened by the tactics adopted by some landlords. 
"Sometimes, the landlords would just knock on the door and walk in and start taking pictures," said Hyun Lee, a director at Committee Against Anti-Asian Violence, which has helped tenants in eviction cases. "They would ask to see the tenants' passports and green cards and tell them, 'You are illegal, and I am going to report you to the I.N.S.' "
And often, said Ms. Lee, these immigrants work up to 12 hours a day for six or even seven days a week. They simply do not have the time and energy to battle their landlords. 
"It becomes, 'O.K., I don't want the trouble,' " Ms. Lee said. " 'Give me some time, and I will move out.' "
New rentals in Chinatown are commanding at least four times the rent of rent-controlled and rent-stabilized units, according to Community Board 2, which encompasses northern Chinatown. Rents on studio apartments are now as high as $1,600 a month.
And the average price of a condominium in the area has shot up by 28 percent since last year; two-bedroom apartments are sold for $700,000 to $900,000, according to the Corcoran Group.
Scott Durkin, the chief operating officer of Corcoran, said the market in Chinatown was strong and getting stronger. "All the hip bars in the East Village and on the Lower East Side are close by," he said. "People like the rawness of the community and the mix of different types of people." 
This is not lost on Chinatown's landlords. "Everyone who is a clever landlord would empty out the units, do expensive renovations and rent out at the market rate," said Arthur Strickler, the district manager of Community Board 2. 
The landlords say they are simply trying to do what all people in capitalist societies do: make some money.
"For the amount of money we put into these buildings, the return is not that great," said a landlord in his 20's who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "The construction cost has gone up. And we have to pay for insurance, heat, repairs, everything."
While other immigrant neighborhoods in New York have undergone sometimes painful change after the second and third generations have left the city for the suburbs, Chinese advocates argue that Chinatown still provides a vital entryway for thousands of new arrivals each year.
"We are afraid that the community will unravel," said Christopher Kui, executive director of Asian Americans for Equality. "We are afraid that Chinatown will become just another tourist attraction, losing its economic and cultural identity."
But others argue that the change could be good for Chinatown.
"Gentrification, for all the problem it creates, also brings improvement," said Frank Braconi, a professor at New York University's Real Estate Institute and the executive director of the Citizens Housing and Planning Council, a nonprofit organization. Dr. Braconi said that as more retailers arrive in a gentrifying neighborhood, better jobs become available and residents can afford the more expensive housing. "Evidently, low-income people also value and appreciate and want these changes," he said.
Right now, Mr. Zhou and his wife are finding that things are tight. Because they are now citizens, they receive $500 a month in Social Security benefits. They pay $300 rent and the remaining $200 has to buy prescriptions for his heart disease and put food on the table. So they scour the neighborhood for free meals provided by churches and centers for the elderly. 
Do they think about moving back to China?
"This is our home," said Mr. Zhou, shaking his head. "We are citizens, and we are not going back."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL; 
Progress Made on Revenue Sharing

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
The bell has rung signaling the start of the final week of talks before the players are poised to strike if they have no new labor agreement. One week from tonight lights will be out in parks from Florida to Seattle and Montreal to Anaheim, Calif., if negotiators fail to resolve their differences on solutions to baseball's economic problems.
 "We have plenty of time to resolve what needs to be resolved," Rob Manfred, the clubs' chief labor lawyer, said yesterday. There is indeed enough time if the two sides are willing to compromise on a luxury tax on payrolls and the amount of the clubs' local revenue to be shared. But the major question hovering is how far each side is willing to go to effect that critical compromise. 
 The two sides have moved tantalizingly close on the revenue-sharing issue, more so in their informal discussions than in actual proposals made. But they remain distant on the tax issue, and one cannot be settled without the other.
Possibly today, but more likely tomorrow or Sunday, the union will respond to the clubs' latest proposals on economic issues. Then the clubs' negotiators will have a better idea where they stand because the union, in informal talks, has apparently not indicated where it might be willing to go on tax rates and thresholds.
On the sharing of local revenue, the two sides are officially $33 million apart, the clubs at $268 million, the players at $235 million. Management negotiators reached their number with a new proposal Tuesday. But their proposal did not present any new information to the union; the union already knew, from informal discussions, where the clubs were willing to go.
As one negotiator said, the clubs made the proposal to try to keep the bargaining process moving.
In their informal discussions, one person familiar with them said, management negotiators have indicated they need between $252 million and $258 million to be transferred from the wealthiest clubs to the not-so-wealthy. An amount in that range, the person said, would enable the clubs to achieve the economic equivalent of the commissioner's blue-ribbon panel report, although structured differently.
Union officials apparently have not signaled if they are willing to go beyond $235 million. They might be amenable to such a move if the elements of the luxury tax are satisfactory to them, not that the tax itself will be satisfactory because they really do not want a tax at all.
Three elements of the tax plan are critical to an agreement: the tax rates, the payroll threshold over which the tax will take effect and the fourth year of a tax plan.
That fourth year could be the sleeper in the agreement, the element that scuttles a potential deal.
The clubs have proposed a four-year tax plan, the players a three-year formula. In their informal discussions, the two sides have told each other they are firm on the number of years the tax would be in effect.
In the agreement that expired last Nov. 7, the luxury tax was in effect in 1997, '98 and '99 but not in 2000 and 2001. The 2000 season was the last year covered in that agreement, but 2001 was an option year, which the union exercised.
In that agreement, payrolls over a threshold, which rose each year, were taxed at 35 percent each of the first two years and at 34 percent the third year. 
The union proposed a different tax structure this time, and the clubs adapted their proposal to that structure. This would be a recidivist tax under which a club would be taxed at a higher rate each time it exceeded the threshold.
The union does not want the tax to be levied in the last year of a new agreement, 2006. The clubs, however, say a recidivist tax would not work if there is no penalty for a fourth-time offender. 
The Yankees, to use the team with by far the highest payroll as an example, could be taxed the first three years and then have an even higher payroll in the fourth year than in any of those years but not have to pay a tax. That is a situation the clubs say cannot be allowed to exist.
Commenting on the tax issue yesterday, Manfred said, "Once we made a move into their structure, it's just about numbers." He was talking about rates and thresholds, but year No. 4 is no simple number.
The union has proposed rates of 15 percent for the first time, 25 percent for the second and 30 percent for the third. The clubs proposed 37.5 percent, 42.5 percent, 47.5 percent and 50 percent for the fourth time.
The union has proposed thresholds for their three-year plan of $130 million, $140 million and $150 million. The clubs have proposed a $102 million threshold for each year but have indicated in informal discussions that $110 million might be possible.
Negotiators continue to clean up noncore issues. In sessions yesterday, they completed the contract language on the new service rule. They also discussed such matters as scheduling, interleague play and the assignment of player contracts.

HEADLINE: Cuomo and Running Mate Hit McCall Where It Hurts 

BYLINE:  By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD 

 BODY:
Taking on H. Carl McCall on an issue Mr. McCall has sought to make his own, Andrew M. Cuomo and his running mate yesterday criticized him for what they called his failure to improve the academic performance of students while he was president of the New York City school board.
 In one of their few joint appearances on a substantive issue, Mr. Cuomo, the former federal housing secretary and a Democratic candidate in the Sept. 10 gubernatorial primary, and his choice for lieutenant governor, Charlie King, made their point outside Public School 97 in Lower Manhattan. But it was Mr. King who delivered some of the harshest words directed against Mr. McCall, the state comptroller and Mr. Cuomo's opponent. 
 "Why don't we look at the record of Carl McCall when he was the head of the school board," Mr. King said as Mr. Cuomo stood next to him in front of a throng of supporters, the largest number in several weeks for a campaign event.
"At that time," Mr. King continued, referring to Mr. McCall's term on the board from 1991 to 1993, "reading and math scores went down for New York City's children. Attendance, which is at one of its lowest points in our school system, went down. And the only thing that went up was the size of our children's classes."
By contrast, Mr. Cuomo was more restrained, not mentioning Mr. McCall by name. He said he agreed with Mr. King's assessments but, when asked if Mr. McCall had failed, replied that journalists and voters "will have to determine" the answer.
Mr. McCall's campaign disputed assertions that academic performance went down during his time on the board; in truth the academic performance of some students did go down, but some went up.
"Carl is very proud of his time at the Board of Education," said Steven Greenberg, Mr. McCall's spokesman.
The event, though, came as Mr. Cuomo's camp is seeking to boil down its campaign to a few core issues -- education and social problems downstate, economic troubles upstate -- while disputing the notion among pundits that Mr. McCall is running far ahead of Mr. Cuomo in the court of public opinion.
The Cuomo campaign raised questions this week about a widely quoted poll issued last week by Quinnipiac University that showed Mr. Cuomo trailing Mr. McCall among likely voters in the Democratic primary.
The poll was misleading, Mr. Cuomo's aides said, because it included in the final tally of McCall and Cuomo supporters some people who had yet to make up their minds but who said which way they were leaning.
If those people are counted as undecided, Mr. McCall, the state comptroller, still has a 13-point lead, but with 35 percent of the voters undecided. Such a large number of voters who have not made up their mind means the race is still a toss-up, said Mark Penn, Mr. Cuomo's chief pollster.
Maurice Carroll, the director of the Quinnipiac Poll, stood by his poll's published results, which showed Mr. McCall with a 16-point lead among likely voters and with 21 percent of respondents undecided. He said it was a common and defensible practice to include likely voters who are leaning toward one candidate or another as supporting that candidate in a final tally.
Mr. Cuomo yesterday urged reporters not to read too much into the polls, saying they are often inaccurate.
Lee Miringhoff, the polling director at Marist College and the president of the National Council on Public Polls, said it was not uncommon for pollsters to include "leaners" in final tallies of support as election approaches, when polling becomes more art than science. But he said they generally disclose that fact and did not characterize the numbers as solid. "If you put leaners into the calculation, that's soft support," he said. "The issue of disclosure is an important one."

HEADLINE: Shortage Ends As City Lures New Teachers 

BYLINE:  By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
After years of struggling to recruit enough certified teachers to fill even half of its classroom vacancies, New York City has attracted more than 8,000 qualified candidates for the fall, in effect ending what school officials called the most crippling teacher shortage in decades.
 Education officials attribute the striking increase in certified applicants to the floundering economy and to a recent contract agreement that raised entry-level teacher salaries to $39,000 from $31,910. In addition, an alternative form of certification that requires far less training has drawn several thousand people who might never have considered teaching otherwise. New York City has 80,000 teachers, of whom 16 percent were uncertified last year. 
 As of last week, the school system said, it had offered jobs to 8,300 certified teachers, meaning they have passed the requisite exams and education courses. (For permanent certification, teachers must get a master's degree by the end of their fifth year.) Harold O. Levy, who stepped down last week as schools chancellor, said then that he expected certified teachers to fill at least 90 percent of the vacancies in September. In contrast, only half the teachers hired in 2001 were certified; in other recent years, the number dipped as low as 40 percent. 
To fill the void, the school system had resorted to hiring thousands of uncertified teachers with little or no training, many of whom had repeatedly failed the state licensing exams. School officials used to refer to this last-minute hiring as the fogged-mirror test: if a mirror held to the applicant's mouth fogged, they joked, the applicant was clearly breathing and therefore met the basic qualification for teaching in New York.
The tide began to turn in 2000, when the State Board of Regents adopted a new policy requiring that all New York City teachers be certified by September 2003. As a first step, the policy -- enforced by court order -- barred the city from placing uncertified teachers in its 100 lowest-performing schools in 2000-01.
In response, Mr. Levy hastily created an alternative certification program that recruited career-changers and recent college graduates with no teaching experience, gave them a month of intensive education courses and assigned them to those lowest-performing schools.
As part of the program, approved by the state, the school system paid for these novice teachers to get master's degrees in education during their first few years on the job. The program, New York City Teaching Fellows, has expanded tenfold and will place 2,000 new recruits in city schools in September. They will join about 1,500 teaching fellows already in the system.
Altogether, about 2,500, or 30 percent, of the new certified teachers this fall will have alternative certification. In addition to the teaching fellows, they include nearly 200 recruits from Teach for America, the nonprofit group that places recent college graduates in troubled schools after a summer of training, and about 300 from other alternate-route programs.
Since these recruits have not spent nearly as much time learning how to teach as those with traditional certification -- many of whom took education courses in college and completed student-teaching stints -- some educators question whether they really count as qualified teachers. "It's a disingenuous claim," said Arthur Levine, the president of Teachers College at Columbia University. "New York has reclassified what it means to be a certified teacher, and what it means is we will still have large numbers of students this fall whose teachers are unprepared to teach them."
The question of what makes a qualified teacher is being hotly debated not just in New York but nationwide, as hundreds of thousands of teachers from the baby-boomer generation prepare to retire and districts scramble to ensure that they are not left short. Like New York, many school districts around the country, including Los Angeles, Atlanta and Washington, have started alternative certification programs, typically sending the participants into poor inner-city schools with high turnover rates.
President Bush's No Child Left Behind law calls for a "highly qualified" teacher in every classroom by 2006, and Rod Paige, the education secretary, has said that career-changers and others with alternative certification meet that definition.
In a recent report, Mr. Paige dismissed the pedagogical course work offered by schools of education -- like Teachers College -- as cumbersome and often ineffective.
"Many academically accomplished college graduates and midcareer professionals with strong subject-matter backgrounds are often dissuaded from entering teaching because the entry requirements are so rigid," the report said. "At the same time, too many individuals earn certification even though their own content knowledge is weak."
New teachers with alternative certification were in abundance yesterday during an induction ceremony for the school system's new recruits at the Madison Square Garden Theater, presided over by Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein. When a teachers' union official asked how many of the recruits present were New York City Teaching Fellows, hands shot up throughout the theater.
Claudine Gebhard, 27, who became a teaching fellow after several years in the fashion business, said she was not particularly concerned about her relative lack of preparation.
"They really hold your hand a lot in this program," said Ms. Gebhard, who will teach in East Harlem. "We'll have lots of support."
In contrast, Jeannette MacMillan, a new recruit who will teach in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, has traditional certification because she was a student-teacher and got a master's degree in education from Howard University. Ms. MacMillan, 24, said she was sure her years of training would prove invaluable. But like Ms. Gebhard, she said that her most important training was yet to come.
"I don't think anything can actually prepare you for working with your own class of kids," Ms. MacMillan said.
While the school system had so many certified applicants this year that it actually rejected 1,250, it has still not found enough who specialize in math, science, special education and bilingual education, all perennial shortage areas.
The system has hired about 280 uncertified teachers to fill those vacancies, said Margie Feinberg, a spokeswoman. Most of them -- along with a number of uncertified teachers already teaching those subjects -- are on track to be certified by next September, the state deadline. It remains unclear how many of the city's new certified teachers have worked in other school systems and how many will be teaching for the first time this fall.
The new teachers' contract significantly increased -- to nearly $61,000 from $43,370 -- the maximum yearly salary that certified teachers hired from other districts could initially earn and the school system hoped that would be an irresistible incentive. School officials could not provide figures this week, but Randi Weingarten, the teachers' union president, said it appeared that the number of new teachers with experience elsewhere was low.
Many new recruits still lacked a specific assignment as of yesterday -- a likely result of overhiring because the system never knows for sure how many vacancies it has until the first few weeks of school.
Much of the hiring was done last spring -- earlier than usual -- because school officials feared the salary increase would compel a flood of older teachers to retire over the summer. But in fact, the number who have retired as of this month -- about 3,000 -- was smaller than expected. New York is among a number of districts nationwide whose teacher shortages have abated, at least temporarily, in part because of the shaky economy. 
Diane Ravitch, the education historian, said she suspected that the salary increase was the main reason that New York had attracted so many certified teachers this year. The challenge now, she said, will be giving the new teachers the support they need to stay for the long term. 
In welcoming the new recruits at Madison Square Garden yesterday, Chancellor Klein -- who started his own job only three days earlier -- urged them to seek out veteran teachers for support. "There are allies there who you can enlist even though you will feel at times besieged and overwhelmed," he said. "My priority is to make it as good as it can possibly be for those of you who are in the classroom instructing the children."

HEADLINE: The Outrage Constraint 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The high pay of America's C.E.O.'s reflects intense competition among companies for the best managerial talent. Stock options and other typical forms of executive compensation are designed to provide incentives for performance. These incentives align the personal interests of managers with those of shareholders.
 Nothing in the preceding paragraph is true. That's the message of an extraordinary research paper circulated by the National Bureau of Economic Research, an economics think tank. The paper is must reading for anyone trying to understand what's really going on in our economy. 
 I first read this paper, "Executive compensation in America: Optimal contracting or extraction of rents?" by Lucian Bebchuk, Jesse Fried and David Walker (of Harvard, Berkeley and Boston University respectively), last December. It was largely due to their analysis that I concluded, early in the game, that Enron would be only the first of many scandals.
What they show is that the official theory of the corporation, in which the C.E.O. serves at the pleasure of a board that represents shareholder interests, is thoroughly misleading. In practice, modern C.E.O.'s set their own compensation, limited only by the "outrage constraint" -- outrage not on the part of the board, whose members depend on the C.E.O.'s good will for many of their perks, but on the part of outside groups that can make trouble. And the true purpose of many features of executive pay packages is not to provide incentives but to provide "camouflage" -- to let C.E.O.'s reward themselves lavishly while minimizing the associated outrage.
The most obvious case in point is stock options. There is a good argument for linking an executive's pay to his company's stock price, but a true incentive scheme would have features that one almost never sees in practice. For example, an executive's pay should depend on his company's stock price compared with a benchmark index composed of other, similar companies, so that what he gets reflects the job he is doing, not general market conditions.
In fact, however, a C.E.O. almost always receives stock options at the current market price -- end of story. If the stock price goes up, he cashes in. If it goes down, he receives new options at the lower price. There are, to be fair, quirks in the tax law that encourage this practice. But the main reason executives are paid this way is that it gives them an almost sure thing -- unless the stock falls steadily, sooner or later an executive who keeps getting options at the current price makes a lot of money -- yet does so in a way that camouflages the sweetness of the deal. The options grant often isn't even counted as a corporate expense, and the payoff, when it comes, can always be represented as a reward for achievement. 
Thanks to the growing skill of companies at camouflage, and also to a steady erosion of old inhibitions against apparent excess, the average pay of C.E.O.'s at major companies has skyrocketed. It was "only" 40 times that of an average worker a generation ago; it's 500 times as much today. That's a lot of money, but the direct expense is not the main problem. Instead, it's the fact that the tricks used to camouflage exorbitant pay give executives an enormous incentive to get the stock price up in time to cash in their options.
We're only beginning to see the extent to which that incentive distorts corporate behavior. We now know that some companies engaged in grandiose programs of acquisition and expansion that ended in grief -- but only after top executives had profited immensely. We also know that companies eager to meet or surpass analysts' expectations engaged in creative accounting on a grand scale: in each of the last few years of the bubble most big companies reported double-digit profit growth, yet national statistics show that true corporate profits were hardly growing at all. 
I'm not claiming that C.E.O.'s are conscious villains, twirling their mustaches and chortling over their evil doings. People are very good at rationalizing their actions -- even Jeff Skilling reportedly regards himself as a victim -- and the great majority of C.E.O.'s surely stayed within the letter of the law.
But the fact is that we have a corporate system that gives huge incentives for bad behavior. And I would be very surprised if Wednesday's plea by Enron's Michael Kopper is the beginning of the end; at best, it's the end of the beginning.

HEADLINE: More Aid Seen For Business Downtown 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH P. FRIED 

 BODY:
New York State and City are planning to increase financial aid to small businesses near the World Trade Center site that suffered financial losses stemming from the Sept. 11 attack, a government official knowledgeable about the plan said last night.
 The increase would come after months of criticism from business people in the area that the amounts available in the World Trade Center Business Recovery Grant Program were too small to provide meaningful aid to small businesses that were forced to remain closed the longest and suffered the biggest losses. 
 But the official denied that the planned increase was an admission that the state and city agencies that administer the program, which uses federal funds, had provided for inadequate grants when the program began in January. 
"We were dealing with an unprecedented situation," the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said of the initial planning for determining the amounts of the grants. "It's sensible to amend the plan based on subsequent events."
As of last Friday, $238 million of the $481 million available in the program had been approved for distribution. Critics had called this too small a proportion, given the need, and said it showed that the grant awards process should be loosened. 
Before yesterday, officials of the two agencies involved, the state's Empire State Development Corporation and the city's Economic Development Corporation, expressed confidence that the remaining amount would be distributed under the original rules as small businesses continued to apply for the aid, which has been available to businesses from 14th Street to the Battery. Applications can be submitted until Dec. 31.
The grant increase -- whose amount was still being determined yesterday -- would be available only to businesses immediately around the trade center site: between Chambers Street and Rector Street on the north and south, and from Broadway to the Hudson River.
Under the existing rules, a small business in that neighborhood can receive up 4 percent of its previous annual gross revenues -- or 10 days of losses based on a 250-day year -- up to a maximum of $300,000. Lesser amounts are available farther from the trade center site. Small businesses are defined as those with up to 500 employees.
More than 9,300 businesses in the overall area from 14th Street southward have applied for the grants and more than 8,500 have received the $238 million so far distributed. Figures were not available on how much of the totals involved businesses in the smaller area where the increase is planned.
Critics of the program have said that businesses in that area generally have had the greatest need, because they tended to be closed the longest -- some are still closed -- and to have the greatest building and inventory damage.
The official who told of the planned change said that businesses that have already received aid could apply for the difference between what they have been given and the new maxium.
He said he did not believe changes were being planned in another major program, which provides grants of up to $5,000 per employee to businesses with up to 200 workers that sign leases to remain in or move to the area south of Canal Street. Critics have said that program is too restrictive. Officials have said the restrictions are needed to ensure that the aid has significant impact on the area's recovery.

HEADLINE: State's Largest Charter School Faces a Critical Year 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: ROCHESTER, Aug. 20 

 BODY:
The academic year is off to a rocky start at the Charter School for Science and Technology, the state's largest charter school. Earlier this month it announced that it was dropping its 9th- and 10th-grade programs for this year, forcing 122 students to scurry to find other schools. The beginning of classes has been delayed by nine school days, to Sept. 4, to give teachers and administrators more time. The science tables have not been installed for laboratory work. The job of principal remains unfilled.
 The school and its management company, Edison Schools Inc., are trying to rebound from a year of disappointing test scores, classroom behavior problems and turnover of students and teachers. The school and Edison hope that by delaying the high school programs and sharpening curriculum, they can improve academic performance in kindergarten through eighth grade. 
 "There's no magic pill," said Lyn Bedell, president of the school's board of trustees, "but we remain absolutely convinced that the school can be a success."
A strong showing in Rochester is increasingly important to Edison, whose stock price has plummeted in recent months after a series of setbacks. Last week, officials in Georgia voted to end Edison contracts for two elementary schools in Macon. The Dallas school superintendent has said he wants to cancel his district's contract with Edison. In Philadelphia, the company received a contract to run only 20 city schools rather than the 45 it had hoped for. 
The Philadelphia experience has led Edison to redouble its efforts to run large charter schools like Rochester's, said John Chubb, Edison's chief education officer, who met with board members and teachers today to outline plans to improve achievement. "We're more than happy to do large clusters in urban areas," he said, "but the politics of that is very challenging."
Schools like Rochester's, with about 1,000 students, are large enough to provide economies of scale and, since they are independent, they have fewer political complications. The Rochester school is one of the largest in Edison's network, which this year will administer schools for about 84,000 children in 23 states.
The school, which is in an old industrial neighborhood, occupies six and a half floors of a former Bausch & Lomb lens factory up the street from the Genesee Brewery and across the Genesee River from the Eastman Kodak Company's headquarters. Edison financed renovation of the building and collects an annual management fee of about $1.1 million from the school.
Signaling Rochester's importance, H. Christopher Whittle, Edison's founder and chief executive, visited last week. Performance is critical this year, its third, since Edison makes the review of its five-year charter depend chiefly on a school's performance in its third year. 
"By your fourth year, you have to look like you've created a school that deserves to stay open," Mr. Chubb said. "You want to create a model school, not just a school that can hold onto its charter."
When it opened in fall 2000, the school promised a science and technology curriculum that would prepare students for jobs in the city's high-tech industries. Math scores have not been released, but only 16 percent of fourth graders and 6.7 percent of eighth graders met or exceeded state standards in English last school year, down from the previous year. 
Some parents have been delighted with the program, though. Marcus Robinson said his son's performance in math and English was much better at the charter school than the private school he had previously attended. Mr. Robinson, who is African-American, noted that charter schools could provide both educational choice and racial diversity, a combination rarely found in other public or private urban schools. 
Yet many people believe the school tried to do too much, too soon.
"It had a lot of start-up pains," said Suzanne Topping, who has transferred her son and daughter back to city schools. Inexperienced teachers often had difficulty maintaining order in the classroom, she said. 
State inspectors have noted behavior problems. The Charter Schools Institute, which monitors schools authorized by the State University of New York trustees, imposed a corrective action plan in 2001, calling for codes of conduct and staff training at the school. The state lifted the plan earlier this month, saying its conditions had been met.
Unruly behavior was one reason the school canceled its high school program this year. Many students transferring from city schools had academic and behavioral trouble, a problem that was more common in the higher grades. Having older students in the school would have exacerbated the problem, Ms. Bedell said.
"High school has been a challenge" for Edison and the charter school's administration and faculty, Ms. Bedell noted in an Aug. 1 letter to the state. "Behavior of the high school students has been disruptive to the learning environment of the entire school."
The school hopes to restore the 9th grade and start the 10th grade in fall 2003, and eventually to expand through 12th. Ms. Bedell and other supporters stress the importance of giving the school an opportunity to develop an identity and a stronger focus on science and technology.
Despite its high student turnover, the school has a waiting list. Its teachers remain optimistic, said Natasha Zuber, who moved from New York City to Rochester to be a science coordinator at the school. 
"We're taking some shots and some bumps along the way," she said, "but we're here to stay."

HEADLINE: Victims' Fund Announces First Awards 

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
Nearly a year after 3,300 people were killed or injured in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the federal government yesterday announced the first awards to compensate the relatives of victims, offering 25 families an average of $1.36 million, from a low of $300,000 to a high of $3 million.
 Kenneth R. Feinberg, the special master in charge of the Sept. 11 Victim Compensation Fund, disclosed few details about individual awards or demographics, citing concern for the families' privacy. But he did say that the first group represented a subset of the diverse universe of those who died, including policemen, firefighters and workers at the World Trade Center. 
 Most, if not all, of the 25 families filed early in the process because of personal or financial reasons, Mr. Feinberg said, and were therefore more inclined to accept his assumptions about the earning power of their relatives. 
Yet of the 25 awards announced yesterday, only nine families have so far accepted the amount disbursed. Twelve have not yet responded and four have requested hearings to appeal their cases in person before Mr. Feinberg, suggesting a level of surprise or disappointment that may deepen as more complicated cases are filed. The 25 families were first notified in late July, and given 120 days to respond.
Still, Mr. Feinberg said that the first awards represented a watershed for a fund without precedent that, in the end, is expected to pay families a total of $4 billion. 
"This is the starting point," he said in an interview. "I feel that the numbers we are announcing will hopefully encourage families and injured victims to accelerate their participation in the program."
When Congress created the fund in September as part of an airline bailout package, many officials praised it as a fast and straightforward alternative to litigation. To be eligible for the fund's anticipated average payment of about $1.5 million -- after various deductions have been made -- families have to waive their rights to sue anyone other than terrorists.
So far, very few have sued, though hundreds have taken steps toward possible legal action against the airlines and other entities. And very few people have formally applied to the fund, either. Many who have not applied have found the process complicated or have complained about the basic rules for calculating the awards.
Other families have simply not been ready to proceed. "People are grieving," Mr. Feinberg said.
Of the 662 families who have submitted documents indicating a willingness to apply to the fund, only about 100 have filed complete applications. The 25 families who have been offered awards belong to that group. Of the remaining 75, about two dozen are considered test cases touching on topics from mental anguish to extenuating economic circumstances that are designed to establish the boundaries for awards. Awards in those cases may be announced within the next two weeks, Mr. Feinberg said.
Those who accept Mr. Feinberg's conclusions will receive a check within 20 days. Those who do not may request a hearing. 
So far, only one family has acknowledged accepting an award. The family of a young man, a recent college graduate in his 20's who made almost $60,000 a year, was awarded $1.19 million in gross compensation. After deductions for benefits like life insurance and worker's compensation, the final award was $1.04 million -- a number that the man's family said was fair.
For all 25 families, the average amount of the deductions -- called collateral offsets -- was approximately $200,000, according to an individual who reviewed the claims. The median award after deductions, meanwhile, was $1.23 million, or $130,000 less than the average, suggesting that there were more people with modest incomes than with higher ones.
Initially, reaction to the first awards has been varied.
Larry S. Stewart, president of Trial Lawyers Care, a national consortium of 1,300 lawyers offering free legal services, said that the awards, while important, were not indicative of future awards.
"For the people who are standing on the sidelines, hopefully this will be a signal to them, not about the amount, that the process is under way and that it will work," Mr. Stewart said.
But Mr. Stewart, along with several relatives of victims, expressed disappointment with the lack of details.
Two weeks ago, Lynn M. Castrianno, who lost her brother, Leonard, a broker at Cantor Fitzgerald, suggested in a letter to Mr. Feinberg that he include detailed tables on injury claims, death claims, the victim's location, the estimated award based on Mr. Feinberg's preliminary calculations, and the actual award. But what she found yesterday was so vague, she said, that she "printed it off to make sure I wasn't missing something."
"It's good to have some information, but there's still an awful lot of questions that I have," said Ms. Castrianno, whose family has not yet applied. "Most people are going to look at it and say, 'What does it mean for me?' and looking at this information, most people aren't going to be able to make that decision."
The families of victims who were 35 or younger and made $50,000 or less, for instance, were offered $610,000 to $1.4 million, according to the fund's Web site, www.usdoj.gov/victimcompensation. And the highest award, $3 million, was offered to someone whose age group was not given who made between $200,000 and the $231,000-a-year unofficial cap that Mr. Feinberg has said he would use when calculating economic losses.
The lowest award that has been offered, $300,000, did not apply to the person making the smallest salary, but rather someone making $50,000 to $100,000. This suggests someone, perhaps a policeman, firefighter or rescue worker, who had more deductions in the form of pension, life insurance or other benefits.

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Asia: Hong Kong: Prices Falling 

BYLINE:  By Keith Bradsher (NYT) 

 BODY:
 Consumer prices were 3.4 percent lower in July than a year earlier, compared with a drop of 3.3 percent in the 12 months through June. The deflation rate had been running at 2.4 percent earlier this year. A consulting firm rated Hong Kong the world's most expensive city in which to live this summer, with everything from apartment rents to movie prices higher than in Manhattan. But a stagnant economy and growing competition from the rest of China are pushing down some costs.

 BODY:
 The economy grew 6.3 percent in the second quarter, from April 1 through June 30, compared with the second quarter of last year, keeping pace with forecasts of more than 6 percent growth for the year, the Bank of Korea said yesterday. 
The bank said, however, that the economy grew only 1.4 percent from the first quarter, a rate that was somewhat less than expected. The economy was powered by exports of motor vehicles and electronic items, including semiconductors, despite fears of the impact of the downturn in the United States economy on exports.

HEADLINE: U.S. Presses to Keep India-Pakistan Peace 

BYLINE:  By AMY WALDMAN 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, Aug. 22 

 BODY:
In early June, Deputy Secretary of State Richard L. Armitage flew to Pakistan and India -- nuclear-armed rivals on the brink of war -- and engineered a detente.
 From President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan, he extracted a promise to end raids into Indian territory. From the Indians, he elicited a willingness to wait and see if the promise was kept. 
 Two and a half months later, with Mr. Armitage once again en route to New Delhi and Islamabad, the detente has held, but it has also hardened into what Western diplomats describe as a stalemate. If tensions are lower than during Mr. Armitage's last visit to the region, expectations that he will manage another breakthrough are lower, too. 
In addition to a number of publicly announced de-escalation measures, like pulling naval vessels away from Pakistan's coast, India has taken quieter steps that reduce the immediacy of the war threat -- for instance, reinstating leave for the hundreds of thousands of troops massed along both the Line of Control in Kashmir and the international border between the countries. Indian officials, perhaps still stung by the economic effects of the American travel advisory imposed at the end of May and lifted last month, have been more cautious with war talk.
But the basic situation -- two nuclear-armed neighbors eyeball-to-eyeball -- has not changed. Col. Shutri Kant, a spokesman for the Indian Army, said troops regularly continued to exchange small arms fire (Pakistan always fires first, he said). He said there had been at least one artillery exchange this month.
Indian officials insist that infiltration by Pakistani-backed militants into the state of Jammu and Kashmir has declined but not stopped. India's position, reiterated repeatedly of late, is that it will not engage in a dialogue with Pakistan over the future of Kashmir, which is divided between the two countries and claimed by both, until cross-border terrorism stops.
In an interview with Agence France-Presse this week, General Musharraf denied that there was any remaining government-sponsored infiltration of militants into Indian-controlled Kashmir; he said he would take no further steps toward curbing cross-border terrorism until India reciprocated with a dialogue. "I'm not going to take 10 steps when India doesn't take one even," he said.
Each side accuses the other of trying to skew coming elections in Jammu and Kashmir, India's only Muslim-majority state.
Those elections will be a focus of Mr. Armitage's visit, as American officials have made clear that they see a free, fair vote in the state as crucial to at least some momentum toward peace talks. Rigged Kashmiri elections in the late 1980's helped prompt the armed uprising against India that began in 1989.
Just as Secretary of State Colin L. Powell did when he visited the region last month, Mr. Armitage will urge the Indian government to do whatever necessary to ensure a credible result that yields a more representative government in the state.
Indian officials, however, say they believe that Pakistan is planning to encourage violence by militants as a way to disrupt the election and suppress voter turnout, thereby delegitimizing the results. They say they want Mr. Armitage to press Mr. Musharraf not to interfere.
Last week Mr. Musharraf dismissed the elections as an Indian attempt to legitimize its "illegal occupation." India promptly accused Mr. Musharraf of plotting to sabotage the vote.
Michael Krepon, a South Asia expert at the Henry L. Stimson Center in Washington, said the Powell and Armitage visits were happening "because there is an assumption that if left to their own devices India and Pakistan are going to revert to the brink."
Mr. Armitage began his Asian trip today in Sri Lanka, where he visited the city of Jaffna, which for the first half of the 1990's was under the control of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, who have been waging a civil war for two decades.
He compared Sri Lanka to Vietnam, where he spent six years, and said it was time to resolve differences through peaceful means. "Enough is enough," he said.

HEADLINE: What Is America's Commitment to Iraq? 

BYLINE:  By James P. Rubin; James P. Rubin, a visiting professor at the London School of Economics, is host of a PBS program, "Wide Angle," and former assistant secretary of state in the Clinton administration.

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
The prospect of an American war against Iraq is generating growing opposition around the world. One way the administration could transform the debate is to lay out, in advance and in some detail, its vision for Iraq after Saddam Hussein. And to prove America's ability to implement such a vision, the administration must demonstrate a new resolve to secure and rebuild Afghanistan.
 Here in Europe, even those governments most sympathetic to the Bush administration's assessment of the Iraqi threat are deeply troubled by the lack of a post-invasion strategy. Meanwhile, the instability in Afghanistan does not give Europeans reason to believe that the administration has much staying power. 
 In the weeks before last fall's war against the Taliban and Al Qaeda, the United States and Europe were united in their goals for Afghanistan. Nation-building was back in vogue, although the specific term was usually avoided in Washington. A long-term commitment to peacekeeping troops, reconstruction assistance and humanitarian aid was intended to win the hearts and minds of the Muslim world and prevent Afghanistan from ever again becoming a terrorist base.
Now peacekeeping efforts have been stymied and are limited to a rather small force in Kabul. Despite the good intentions of Hamid Karzai's government, warlordism has come back to much of the country. Nearly everyone, with the important exception of Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, believes that a larger peacekeeping force would help prevent a return to chaos.
Humanitarian aid is being delivered, but the larger-than-expected return of refugees is straining available resources. And much of the help promised by governments around the world for economic and reconstruction aid (roads, schools, infrastructure projects) has been slow to arrive. The cumbersome procedures of international financial institutions and some governments are partly to blame and must be overcome. But the insecurity and continuing violence in Afghanistan are also serious obstacles to reconstruction.
More troops over a much wider area would be welcomed by most Afghans, who still see American and Western soldiers (including Turkish troops) as liberators, not occupiers. The glass is half-full in Afghanistan. The lives of Afghans have improved in terms of human rights, access to food and medicine, and security, but there is still a long way to go to fulfill the hopes created when the United States of America liberates a people from tyranny.
One of the most effective ways the Bush administration could obtain new support for its plans on Iraq would be a mid-course correction on Afghanistan. Western efforts in the Balkans, especially in Kosovo, have shown that strong peacekeeping forces do provide the physical security and psychological boost to enable countries shattered by war to recover.
The administration should stop telegraphing plans to invade Iraq and start developing and publicizing a concrete plan for a post-Saddam Iraq. Why should we wait until war is imminent to spell out for the Iraqi people and the world the benefits that will come from getting rid of Saddam Hussein? American officials could begin now to remind Iraqis of what America did for Germany, Japan, the Philippines and Eastern Europe when they moved from the category of enemy to that of friend.
Supporters of military action are probably right that post-Saddam Iraq will be relatively easy to stabilize. The Iraqi people are highly skilled, highly educated and secular. The prospect of Iraq breaking apart may well be exaggerated, and given Iraq's oil wealth there will be no need for nation-building on the scale required by Haiti, Somalia, Bosnia, Kosovo and Afghanistan.
But it remains crucial that the administration convince the Iraqi people and the world that America is prepared to help Iraq prosper far beyond any change in regime. That means identifying the administrative arrangements and principles we would like to see govern the country, promising substantial peacekeeping forces for many years if necessary, furnishing technical assistance to the new government and its security forces, and starting a reconstruction fund to rebuild a country debilitated by war and economic sanctions.
Announcing the essential elements of such an initiative in an address by the secretary of state and calling an international conference to structure a post-Saddam assistance program would dramatically change perceptions of American military action in Iraq -- and make it far more likely that we could not just win the war with Saddam Hussein but win peace and prosperity for the region. With luck, this approach might even provoke a change of regime from within.

HEADLINE: North Korea's Leader Whistle-Stops in Siberia 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: KHASAN, Russia, Aug. 22 

 BODY:
The end of the line for Russia's railway system, an iron road that extends 7,000 miles from the back door of Europe to the Sea of Japan, is here, at a lowered gate over a rusty railroad bridge that blocks access to the Korean peninsula. Just over the Tumen River, lost today in fog and rain, lies North Korea.
 Kim Jong Il, riding in his father's old armored railway car, plans to stop in this border town on Saturday on his way home from a meeting with Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president, in Vladivostok. Passing through the town on Tuesday on his way to the meeting with Mr. Putin, the North Korean leader was greeted by a coat of fresh pink paint and newly planted planted flowers at the "Kim Il Sung cottage," a wooden dacha built to host North Korea's founding father during the heyday of the Soviet alliance with Pyongyang. 
 With their respective railroad ministers in tow, the two leaders are scheduled to meet on Friday to hammer out a timetable for linking the Trans-Siberian Railroad with the booming industrial powerhouse that is South Korea.
"Everyone hopes they can come to a solution," Aleksandr V. Kulinich, Russia's regional railway manager, said at Khasan station, an echoing Soviet-era hall, where an optimist recently posted all signs in Korean and Russian. 
A rail route through North Korea would cut costs and shipping times in half for containers that now go by sea from South Korea to Europe. 
Russia's motives have changed as much as the landscape here. Bomb shelters built here half a century ago to protect Russian workers from American warplanes during the Korean War are now used to grow mushrooms. No longer motivated by the Communist solidarity of the cold war, Russia now is interested in cold cash. Half a million South Korean containers a year, a figure that has been forecast, could push the Trans-Siberian Railroad into the black.
"The road would mean prosperity for the town, new positions, social infrastructure," said Ivan V. Stepanov, mayor of Khasan, a town of 900 people, 20 percent fewer than five years ago. Underlining his words, a goat looked woefully over this economically depressed village from its perch on a rotting window sill of an abandoned government building.
In 1988, rail cargo between the Soviet Union and North Korea peaked at 5.5 million tons. The railway director estimated that today's level is about one-fifth that figure. 
Of the 2,000 North Koreans who came as rail passengers through here last year, almost all were going north to work in state-organized construction or logging, earning wages about half the level of what is paid to Russians. 
Last fall, Russia sent dozens of experts to North Korea to survey the railroad across the river and the possibilities of rebuilding it to conform to Russian gauge. Russia has already offered to pay as much as $125 million of the costs of renovating a line that has seen little major work since it was built over 60 years ago by Japanese colonial administrators. Next month, 30 North Korean students are to travel to Novosibirsk to attend a six-year program at a Russian railway college.
"The Russians checked 60 tunnels and found them all in poor condition, needing repairs," said Mr. Kulinich, who has visited North Korea several times. But aside from building a "friendship house" last fall to match the Kim Il Sung cottage here he has not seen the North Koreans do anything other than routine maintenance on their railroad.
Impatient with two years of promises from North Korea, South Korea offered last week to pay $25 million to buy sleepers and rails for North Korea for linking what is to be called the Trans-Korean Railway.
"It would be little harm for the South to spend that amount for this project," Jeong Se Hyun, South Korea's unification minister, said on South Korean state radio. The total bill for the project could reach as high as $3 billion.
The stumbling block appears to be North Korea's military. In a world where the two Koreas technically are still at war, North Korea seems loathe to lose what it regards as a major strategic advantage: bottling up South Korea on the southern end of the peninsula. 
Although one of Mr. Kim's titles is chairman of North Korea's National Defense Commission, his envoys to a meeting with with South Koreans last week would not commit the military to a date for talks on pushing the railroad through the demilitarized zone.

HEADLINE: British Aide Says Toppling Hussein Is Not a Goal for London 

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE KAPNER 

DATELINE: LONDON, Aug. 22 

 BODY:
Reinstating United Nations weapons inspectors not the removal of Saddam Hussein -- is the centerpiece of Britain's policy toward Iraq, Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said today. 
 The statement, made on the BBC radio program "Today," underscored the differences between the United States, which has made the removal of Mr. Hussein a top priority, and Britain, its closest ally in the campaign against terrorism. 
 Prime Minister Tony Blair is facing growing opposition to the use of military force in Iraq from within his own Labor Party as well as from the Conservative and Liberal opposition, and some cabinet members have called for an open debate on the issue. 
President Bush, who is also encountering some internal opposition to military action, has said the return of United Nations weapons inspectors to Iraq would be inadequate. Removing Mr. Hussein remains an important goal of American foreign policy, though Mr. Bush said on Wednesday that he was open to nonmilitary ways of achieving that.
Mr. Straw, in contrast, said today that the return of the weapons inspectors would be the best way of reducing the risk posed by Mr. Hussein and his presumed access to weapons of mass destruction, though he did not rule out removing the Iraqi leader by force if necessary.
"If my prayers were answered," Mr. Straw said, Mr. Hussein would be "removed by divine intervention" tomorrow. "But," he continued, removing him "is not an object of British foreign policy."
World leaders have increasingly voiced their resistance to an invasion of Iraq, and Mr. Straw's comments served as another setback to Mr. Bush's efforts to build a coalition to oust Mr. Hussein.
In Britain, the growing dissent comes ahead of an important Labor Party conference next month. Mr. Blair has already been accused of lacking resolve when it comes to standing up to the United States. A recent video by the rock singer George Michael for his single "Shoot the Dog" portrays Mr. Bush as a cowboy and Mr. Blair as his pet poodle.
Now Mr. Blair faces a potential revolt from within party ranks. Several Labor members of Parliament are planning an antiwar rally on the eve of the conference. Others are threatening to visit Baghdad and meet with Mr. Hussein, as George Galloway, another member of Parliament, did last month. 
Polls have showed that Britons remain divided over the matter. But over the course of the summer, support for an invasion has dwindled, analysts said. A recent poll in The Daily Telegraph suggested that only 19 percent of the people would support joining forces with the United States in military action against Iraq.
As in the United States, some of Britain's top military experts are sounding a cautious note. Sir Michael Quinlan, a former senior official at the Ministry of Defense, writing in The Financial Times, called an assault against Iraq an "unnecessary and precarious gamble, unless there emerges new evidence against Mr. Hussein altogether more compelling than any yet disclosed."
James P. Rubin, who served as assistant secretary of state in the Clinton administration and who is now a visiting professor at the London School of Economics, said Mr. Blair "has tried to avoid choosing between Europe and America on Iraq and a number of other issues. He is trying to bridge a very difficult gap between the Bush administration's focus on the regime change and the broader European focus on the weapons of mass destructions."

An article on Friday about remarks by Foreign Secretary Jack Straw on the British government's Iraq policy misattributed a statement about that policy. The assessment that removing Saddam Hussein is "not an object of British foreign policy" was made by a BBC interviewer, not by Mr. Straw.

HEADLINE: Allen R. Myerson, 47, a Times Business Editor and Writer 

BYLINE:  By ARI L. GOLDMAN 

 BODY:
Allen R. Myerson, an assistant business and financial editor of The New York Times and a former national correspondent for the paper, died yesterday. He was 47 and lived in Glen Ridge, N.J.
 Mr. Myerson fell from a parapet above the 15th floor of the newspaper's building, at 229 West 43rd Street, landing on the roof of an adjacent parking garage, said the police, whose preliminary finding was suicide. 
 At The Times, Mr. Myerson was in charge of Business Day's weekend operations, directing news coverage and editing business news that developed on Saturdays and Sundays.
Mr. Myerson joined The Times in 1989 as a copy editor. From 1993 to 1999 he was the paper's business correspondent in Dallas, traveling throughout the Southwest and writing about the oil and energy business, corporate takeovers and transportation.
He also wrote for other sections. In a 1998 Week in Review article, he compared the wealth of John D. Rockefeller with that of Bill Gates. He found that Mr. Gates was richer, because Rockefeller barely reached a billion dollars. Adjusting the figures for inflation, he found Mr. Gates still ahead -- $25.6 billion for Rockefeller, $46 billion for Mr. Gates. 
Mr. Myerson continued: "But who, then, has lived better? Judging from their homes, it's Rockefeller, though Mr. Gates has only begun to compete."
As an editor, he continued to write. His last major article, about the National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame in Fort Worth, appeared on June 2.
Mr. Myerson also edited a book, "The New Rules of Personal Investing: The Experts' Guide to Prospering in a Changing Economy" (Times Books, 2002).
Allen Reuben Myerson was born in Manhattan on April 13, 1955. He grew up in New Rochelle, N.Y., and graduated from Harvard, where he was an editor of The Independent, a weekly news magazine, and played trombone in the marching band.
Mr. Myerson spent three years at The Globe-Times in Bethlehem, Pa., then moved to The Lexington Herald, in Kentucky, and later to The Dallas Morning News. 
He was also a staff writer at Georgia Trend, a monthly business magazine.
He is survived by his wife, Carol Cropper Myerson; his mother, Natalie Myerson of New Rochelle; and two sisters, Jean Myerson of White Plains and Dr. Merle Myerson of Cooperstown, N.Y.

Bush Widens Exemptions On Foreign Steel Products
The Bush administration excluded more than 178 imported steel products from steep tariffs it imposed in the spring, chipping away at an effort to protect the ailing United States steel industry. The decision, which infuriated American producers, means that nearly one-quarter of all foreign imports are now free to enter the country under normal rules.
 The decision was the latest twist in President Bush's on-again, off-again commitment to free trade. Though administration officials justified their action on dry and technical grounds, it showed that the White House has been forced to backpedal on its protection efforts, in part because American companies say they cannot get specialty products except from overseas.

HEADLINE: Democrats Forecast Deficit Will Run Long and Deep 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 22 

 BODY:
Rather than a budget surplus of $1.6 trillion over the next 10 years, as government forecasters predicted as recently as March, a new analysis by the Senate Budget Committee forecasts huge deficits, especially if President Bush's ideas for further tax cuts become law.
 The committee, which is controlled by Democrats, estimated today that the federal budget deficit would reach $157 billion this year and climb to $180 billion in 2003. The 10-year surplus that both Congressional and Bush administration analysts had predicted this year would be nearly wiped out. 
 Democratic lawmakers plan to use the forecast to fight Republican proposals for deeper tax cuts.
Last month, the White House estimated that the deficit, $165 billion this year, would begin shrinking next year and that a surplus, of $53 billion, would return in 2005. 
Senate Democrats on the Budget Committee said their estimates were close to forecasts that would be released next week by the bipartisan Congressional Budget Office. They are also similar to predictions by some private economists.
The real battle is less about budget trends based on current law than on the impact of additional tax cuts that President Bush has advocated in recent weeks. These include turning temporary tax cuts passed last year into permanent changes. 
Mr. Bush and his senior advisers have also expressed interest in new tax measures, like increasing the amount of tax-deductible contributions people can make in retirement accounts and lowering or eliminating taxes on corporate dividends.
According to the Senate Budget Committee, the government would run deficits all the way to 2009 and end up with an accumulated deficit of $475 billion by the end of 2011. 
"There is simply no escaping the fact that the largest single factor causing the drop in the surplus over the 10 years is the tax cut," Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota and chairman of the Budget Committee, said today.
White House advisers insist that the economic growth stimulated by the tax cuts far outweighs the negative effect of somewhat higher deficits. 
They also contend that additional tax cuts may be a good idea if they rekindle investment.
"Risk premiums are up right now," Glenn Hubbard, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisors, said on Wednesday in an interview.
"We are asking, What changes would be good for investing and risk-taking?" Mr. Hubbard said. "The key is to focus on economic growth."

HEADLINE: Bush Defends Logging Initiative as a Better Means of Management Against Forest Fires 

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: RUCH, Ore., Aug. 22 

 BODY:
Stepping through the blackened cinders left by one of the worst forest fires in Oregon's history, President Bush asserted today that his proposal to allow more logging in national forests would prevent catastrophic blazes and lift local economies. 
 Mr. Bush denounced critics who described his plan as a giveaway for the timber industry. 
 "What the critics need to do is come and see firsthand the effect of bad forest policy," Mr. Bush said as he walked through a charred stand of Douglas fir and ponderosa pine on Squires Peak, trailed by a clutch of cameras and reporters. "That's what they need to come and see." 
"And by the way, there's nothing wrong with people being able to earn a living off of effective forest management," Mr. Bush continued. "There are a lot of people in this part of the state who can't find work."
Mr. Bush flew here this morning from his ranch in Texas for an evocative backdrop to press his proposal to allow more logging of national forestland. He said his plan would remove small trees that have contributed to one of the worst forest fire seasons in the nation's history.
Air Force One flew low and slowly over the Biscuit fire, which started on July 27 and quickly became the largest fire in the state's history at 471,000 acres, banking to starboard to give Mr. Bush a view. 
Once on the ground, Mr. Bush took his motorcade on a slow, winding drive on mountain roads to the top of the 3,200-foot mountain. He stepped out for a carefully arranged tour through the woods, stopping twice to strip a swatch of blackened bark off a Douglas fir, and listening as Ron Wenker, the Medford district manager for the Bureau of Land Management, described the devastation of this fire season.
"We're trying to bring a little common sense to forest policy," Mr. Bush said to two firefighters pouring dirt on a smoldering clump of ground.
Mr. Bush outlined several means intended to encourage the thinning of national forests by the timber industry. He said they would result in the needed removal of excess trees and brush at little cost to the government, while providing jobs to the timber industry.
Among the measures Mr. Bush and his aides pushed were restrictions on litigation that environmental groups have used here to try to slow such efforts to remove some trees.
"The procedural requirements of our environmental laws are not supposed to wreak environmental havoc, and that's what some of them are doing," said James L. Connaughton, the chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality.
The proposal was denounced today by Democratic Congressional leaders and the Sierra Club, as well as other environmental groups, which described it as a backdoor means to provide the timber industry access to national forestland.
The tour was arranged to place Mr. Bush in two contrasting environments, on each side of a dirt road here. The first was where there had been no thinning of the forest; the stand of trees there was destroyed. In a second setting, there had been some thinning of trees and removal of underbrush, and the damage of the fire was much more limited.
"It's pretty clear that this fire prevention strategy of our country has been short-sighted and we, frankly, haven't done a very good job," Mr. Bush said after his tour. He added, "We haven't had a strategy to clear the forest floor of built-up brush and densely packed trees that we have seen firsthand here and in other places around the country create the fuel, the kindling for extremely large fires, like those we're experiencing this year."
Mr. Bush took pains today to portray the proposal in environmental and economic terms, as he tried to balance the conflicting pressures that have settled around the issue. On the environment, he noted that these fires tended to destroy the oldest trees and habitats used by endangered species. "The hands-off policies that have contributed to this environmental crisis have been well intentioned, no question about that," he said. But, he added, "they're dangerous."
Mr. Bush also made it clear that he viewed the proposal as a way to help the local economy. "One of the goals is prevent fire, healthy forests," he said. "Another goal will be to provide jobs."
As is his custom, Mr. Bush mixed in a bit of campaigning by appearing at a fund-raiser this evening for Senator Gordon Smith, a Republican. 
Mr. Bush was greeted in Portland tonight by hundreds of protesters outside his hotel protesting his talk of an Iraq invasion and his environmental policies. It was one of the largest groups of demonstrators Mr. Bush has encountered since Sept. 11.

HEADLINE: North Korea Incurs U.S. Penalty For Missile Parts Sales to Yemen 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 22 

 BODY:
The Bush administration has imposed sanctions against North Korea after concluding that it sold Scud missile components to Yemen before President Bush took office, American officials said today. 
 The timing of the penalties is particularly sensitive given Washington's tenuous relations with North Korea and developments between North and South Korea. The decision to impose them, though largely symbolic, contrasts sharply with the more conciliatory approach recently adopted toward North Korea. 
 The missile components were sent by Changgwang Sinyong Corporation in North Korea, the marketing arm for Pyongyang's missile export program. The company has been a catalyst for earlier penalties, but in this case it is not their only target. 
The sanctions, which bar licenses and contracts for high-tech items, also apply to the North Korean government, under an amendment to the Arms Export Control Act sponsored by Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, on nonmarket economies. They apply to the North Korea's work on missile technology electronics, space systems or equipment and military aircraft.
The United States has no trade with North Korea in these areas, but an administration official said they were important nonetheless.
"We are making a statement to the world that North Korea engages in dangerous and illicit activity," an administration official said. "We are making it clear that if you are a friend of the United States or civil society these are characters you do not want to be associated with."
The move follows more positive signals concerning Washington's relations with North Korea. Last month, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell met with the North Korean foreign minister, Paek Nam Sun, on the sidelines of an Asian regional meeting. It was the highest-level contact with North Korea since President Bush took office. After the session American officials began to consider whether to send a senior State Department official to North Korea. 
On the Korean peninsula, North and South Korea held high-level meetings last week, putting Korean reconciliation back on track after a deadly naval skirmish in June.
A senior Japanese Foreign Ministry official is scheduled to begin talks with his North Korean counterpart this week in a move that may lead to a resumption of talks about the possible normalization of relations. 
Administration officials said that after determining that the North Koreans had shipped the missile components to Yemen, they had had no choice but to impose the sanctions.
But critics assert that the decision reflects the influence of hard-liners within the Bush administration who do not favor a warming of relations and expanded dialogue with North Korea. 
American officials say the shipment of Scud components to Yemen occurred during the Clinton administration. They also say the United States has raised its concerns with Yemen, which has indicated that it does not plan to buy any more missile technology from North Korea.
The sanctions are also stirring a broader debate about the administration's policy toward North Korea. 
President Bill Clinton had sought to negotiate an end to North Korea's missile exports and production. In October 2000, North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il, told Madeleine K. Albright, then the secretary of state, that his nation was prepared to end the export of missiles and missile technology for a price. 
But as the clock wound down on the Clinton administration, the two countries did not finish the deal. Important details, including verification measures, were never resolved. 
North Korea has maintained a moratorium on missile flight tests since 1999 but has continued to sell missiles and missile technology. 
Bush administration officials have portrayed this as a sign of North Korea's bad intentions. Mr. Bush has described North Korea as part of an "axis of evil." But some officials from the Clinton administration assert that the Bush administration has missed an opportunity to negotiate a halt to the missile exports.
"While the Bush administration sits on its hands, the North Koreans have continued to export," said Elisa D. Harris, a specialist on nonproliferation at the University of Maryland who served on the staff of the National Security Council under Mr. Clinton. "The administration appears to be doing very little to bring an end to this activity."
The administration has insisted it is willing to talk with North Korean officials anytime and anywhere. But officials say the discussions must address not only a ban on missile exports and production but also American concerns about North Korea's nuclear program and its million-man army, much of which is deployed close to the border with South Korea.
Administration officials say that such an expanded agenda is necessary to enhance security on the Korean peninsula and produce a relaxation of tensions. But critics say that the toughened demands have made it harder to conclude a deal curtailing the sale and production of missiles, a major worry for the United States and North Korea's neighbors.
"The Bush administration keeps putting new impediments in the way of negotiating a missile deal with the North," said Leon V. Sigal, director of the Northeast Asia Cooperative Security Project at the Social Science Research Council in New York. "Hard-liners seem to be running the show."
An American official acknowledged that the review of the shipment to Yemen had been under way for some time. He insisted that the delay in ordering the penalties did not reflect a policy debate within the administration and was not calculated to affect the broader policy toward North Korea. 
"It simply reflected the difficulty in assembling the necessary intelligence and making a judgment about it," this official said. 
But it is no secret that there have been deep divisions within the administration over policy toward North Korea. Secretary Powell has highlighted the United States' interest in engaging the North Koreans. Other officials, including John R. Bolton, an under secretary of state, have been deeply skeptical of North Korea's intentions. Mr. Bolton is scheduled to go to Japan and South Korea next week.
The North Koreans have recently been informed that the United States has decided on the penalities, American officials said. So far, they do not appear to have responded.
While the disclosure about Yemen is new, North Korea has stirred grave concern in recent years by selling missile technology to Iran and Pakistan. Several officials described the North Korean shipment to Yemen as a "one-time event." Yemeni officials could not be reached for comment.
Yemen has 18 Scud-B missiles, according to the Center for Nonproliferation Studies in Monterey, Calif. A small number were used in Yemen's civil war in 1994.

HEADLINE: BUSH SCALES BACK TARIFFS ON STEEL 

BYLINE:  By Edmund L. Andrews

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 22 

 BODY:
The Bush administration today excluded more than 178 imported steel products from steep tariffs it imposed in the spring, chipping away at an effort to protect the ailing United States steel industry.
 The decision, which infuriated American producers and was applauded by European governments, means that nearly one-quarter of all foreign imports are now free to enter the country under normal rules. 
 The action was the latest twist in President Bush's off-again-on-again commitment to free trade. Though administration officials justified their action on dry and technical grounds, it showed that the White House has been forced to backpedal on its protection efforts, for both domestic and international reasons. Domestically, companies that use steel were complaining that they could not obtain the specialty products they needed. Internationally, the administration had been fiercely attacked by almost all of its largest trading partners. 
But the retreat also reflected the president's struggle to balance political demands from electorally important steel-producing states like Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia with his international goal of opening world markets.
Republicans fighting to hold on to control of the House in the midterm elections in November may find that the exclusions have greatly endangered whatever political support Mr. Bush had built up in those states, but imposing the tariffs to begin with eroded his stance as a free-market advocate.
Mr. Bush carried Ohio and West Virginia in the 2000 election and would like to add Pennsylvania in his re-election bid in 2004. 
In March, Mr. Bush stunned leaders in Europe and Asia by imposing special "safeguard" tariffs of up to 30 percent on most steel imports. At the time, 31 United States steel companies were in bankruptcy proceedings and scores of others were running huge losses.
The European Union, Japan and other countries denounced the new barriers as a violation of international trade treaties and filed legal complaints at the World Trade Organization, which acts as an international court in such disputes. The European Union has also threatened to strike back with retaliatory tariffs on American products like orange juice and motorcycles.
Largely unnoticed, however, the Bush administration has been issuing hundreds of "exclusions" in recent months for particular categories of steel that are difficult or impossible to obtain from American suppliers.
Today's was the biggest and most controversial decision on exclusion, and it quickly provoked a chorus of protest from steel producers, union leaders and politicians from steel-producing states.
American steel companies had argued that 104 of the 178 steel products named today should not be excluded from the tariffs because they are being made -- or at least could be -- in the United States.
The products included a form of galvanized plate used by Chrysler and other automakers, wide-width plate used in high-pressure underground tanks and about 100,000 tons of large-diameter pipe.
All told, the administration has now waived the tariffs on 727 imported steel products. Of 13 million tons in annual steel imports, about 3.2 million tons are now exempt.
Steel executives reacted swiftly and angrily to today's decision.
"We are disappointed by a number of the exclusions announced today," said Thomas J. Usher, the chairman and chief executive of United States Steel in Pittsburgh. "Unfortunately, pressure by foreign governments for unjustified exclusions from the Section 201 remedy has been very strong," he added, referring to the law that covers "safeguard" measures to protect a domestic market from being flooded by imports.
John H. Walker, the chief executive of the Weirton Steel Corporation in West Virginia, said his company would not be hurt directly but would be affected as other American mills scrambled to make up for lost business by entering Weirton's market.
"We are very, very disappointed," Mr. Walker said in a statement. Weirton lost $217 million last year. Despite the tariffs, the company lost nearly $36 million in the three months ended in June.
Steel-state politicians echoed those criticisms.
"It is a major step toward undermining whatever good was coming from the tariffs," said Representative Ted Strickland, an Ohio Democrat whose district includes thousands of workers from Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel, which is in bankruptcy proceedings, and Weirton, which is just across the state line in West Virginia.
But for all the howls of protest from steel companies, today's action appeared to help defuse anger in the European Union, which is one of the United States' biggest trading partners and an ally in coming global trade talks intended to reduce barriers in areas like financial services, investment and telecommunications.
"This is a positive development, which of course we welcome," said a senior official at the European Commission in Brussels. Pascal Lamy, the commission's top trade negotiator, is expected to issue a statement on Friday that strongly implies he will not press for retaliatory measures until at least the time that the World Trade Organization issues a preliminary ruling next spring on whether the steel duties are legal.
Many trade experts, including a large number in the United States, have long argued that the March steel tariffs were an unfortunate capitulation to protectionist pressures. The administration argued that American steel makers were threatened by a flood of imports, even though it did not argue that the imports were being unfairly subsidized.
Rather, it argued that foreign imports were flooding into the United States at such a pace that the industry was threatened. International trade law does allow countries to impose safeguards in such cases. The American case was weak, though, because foreign imports had actually been declining over the last several years.
The real problem, both American and foreign steel executives agree, is that the old integrated American steel producers have huge costs that stem from pension obligations to older workers from the days before steel companies eliminated tens of thousands of jobs.
C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics, a research group in Washington, said President Bush's zigzag approach toward steel fitted into a long-term pattern of American political behavior. Mr. Bergsten argues that Mr. Bush capitulated to protectionism on American steel to generate enough support in Congress for enhanced authority to negotiate much broader free-trade agreements over the next several years.
After a long battle in Congress, Mr. Bush did in fact win passage of what is called Trade Promotion Authority -- by a razor-thin margin of just three votes in the House.
"It's one step backward for every two steps forward," said Mr. Bergsten, an outspoken supporter of lower trade barriers.
Not surprisingly, labor leaders in the steel industry see things differently. After cheering Mr. Bush for imposing the steel tariffs in March, they now accuse him of reversing himself.
"The tariffs adopted last March gave a ray of hope," said Leo Gerard, president of the United Steelworkers of America. "Now that goal is threatened. The administration cannot give with one hand while taking it away with another."

HEADLINE: Army Corps Reform 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I appreciate your recognition of efforts by the Army Corps of Engineers to reach out to critics ("Taming the Untouchable Corps," editorial, Aug. 19). 
 Because of the Army Corps's work, millions of homes and businesses are protected from floods; thousands of workers can depend on shipping jobs; and millions of Americans fish and boat on corps lakes. 
 In the past, America's economic growth depended on harnessing natural resources. Today, we can simultaneously address economic needs and maintain a healthy environment.
But there are no black-and-white answers. Moving people from floodplains lessens damage but destroys communities. The full consequences of man's actions must be assessed before we make decisions. That's why we're strengthening our planning capability. 
Local commanders are committed, as I am, to finding balanced solutions. We will certainly put new laws into effect, but fundamental changes in corps culture are already under way.

HEADLINE: Sorrow So Sweet: A Guilty Pleasure In Another's Woe 

BYLINE:  By WARREN ST. JOHN 

 BODY:
Kenneth Borovina, a 34-year-old carpenter from Dumont, N.J., has a lot to be stressed out about these days. His grandmother is in the assisted living wing of local nursing home, and her life savings have gone from $600,000 to $250,000 in the last year, decimated by the sagging stock market. But there's one thing that cheers him: news that yet another rogue chief executive is under investigation or, better still, arrest.
 "They're getting what they deserve," Mr. Borovina said. "That makes me feel great." 
 Mr. Borovina is indulging in what seems to be this summer's favorite guilty pleasure -- delighting in others' misfortune, or schadenfreude. Between Martha Stewart, Michael S. Ovitz, L. Dennis Kozlowski, Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling and Samuel D. Waksal, there's plenty of misfortune of various kinds to go around and, as it turns out, plenty of delight. 
"Right now the schadenfreude is flying high," said John Portmann, a professor of religion at the University of Virginia and the author of "When Bad Things Happen to Other People" (Routledge, 2000). "We Americans love putting people up on pedestals and we love taking them down."
While many are busy reveling in this ignoble sentiment, a far-flung group of scientists is looking at it with a clinical eye. Taking their cues from evolutionary biology and psychology, they are inducing schadenfreude under research conditions, measuring it and sizing it up in an effort to understand why people can't help feeling an emotion almost everyone agrees is repugnant.
"We want to know what drives the interest in disaster and misfortune,"' said Richard H. Smith, a professor of psychology at the University of Kentucky who has published two papers on the subject.
Philosophers through the ages have pondered the nature of schadenfreude. Schopenhauer wrote that its presence in a person's heart was a clear sign of evil. R. C. Trench, a 19th-century British archbishop, wrote that even having a word for such a damnable emotion was evidence of a culture's corruption. But scientists who study schadenfreude take a more charitable view. However contemptible schadenfreude may seem, they say, we are programmed to feel it. As Professor Smith said, "It's human nature." 
To explore just what provokes such feelings, Professor Smith invited two groups of undergraduates to evaluate what he said was a training video about getting into medical school. One group was shown a film in which an actor played an aspiring medical student who had a BMW, an attractive girlfriend and a wealthy family, and who boasted of being able to get straight A's by barely studying at all.
The other group was shown a tape of a young man of modest means, with no girlfriend or car, who studied himself bleary just to get B's.
Questionnaires, not surprisingly, indicated the students felt higher levels of envy toward the first applicant.
Professor Smith then showed his subjects an epilogue that revealed that neither student was going to medical school after all; they had both been arrested for stealing methamphetamines from a school lab. A second questionnaire measured how his subjects felt about the news. The fall of the wealthy, good-looking medical-school applicant inspired more glee than the fall of the other. 
Envy, Professor Smith said the test showed, was a "potent predictor of schadenfreude."
An Australian researcher, Norman Feather of Flinders University in Adelaide, takes a different view. He says the key is not envy, but resentment. He presented subjects with written descriptions of three imaginary students, one with average grades, one who made A's by studying and another who made A's despite slacking off.
Professor Feather said he found that both A students were envied, but that the A student who didn't have to study was resented as well. He then showed his subjects an epilogue that revealed all three students had done poorly on a test.
"We found that the more students were seen not to deserve their status, people were much happier about their fall from grace," Professor Feather said. He likened his laboratory test to the public reaction to the current corporate scandals. Disgraced executives at a company like Enron, he said, would be like that A student who didn't study. "If there were shoddy practices, then you resent them," he said. "You don't think they're deserving, and you feel schadenfreude." 
Professor Feather and other psychologists base their work on what is known as Social Comparison Theory. The field was conceived in the 1950's by a psychologist named Leon Festinger and is based on a rather simple premise: that humans evaluate themselves not so much by objective standards as by comparison with people around them. An old psychology-conference joke illustrates the point. Two men are walking in the woods when they come across a bear. The first man reaches into his knapsack and pulls out a pair of sneakers. "Why are you putting on sneakers?" the second man asks. "You can't outrun a bear."
"I don't have to outrun the bear," the first answers, "I just have to outrun you."
"Many people don't appreciate that when they come to conclusions about their own abilities -- whether they're a fast runner or not, whether they're smart or not, whether their opinions are the right opinions or not -- they use social comparisons as a basis for that judgment," Professor Smith said. "They look around."
When people around us falter, the theory goes, we often look better to ourselves. "You would expect an evolved psychology to welcome harm to its social competitors," said John Tooby, an evolutionary psychologist at the University of California at Santa Barbara.
Michelle K. Duffy, an assistant professor of management at the University of Kentucky Gatton College of Business and Economics, who has researched schadenfreude in the workplace, believes that part of the pleasure of watching rogue chief executives fall is the chance it gives people to feel morally superior. 
"It allows the average person to say, 'Aha, they didn't earn these things through their merits, they earned them through devious methods,' " Professor Duffy said. "Now we can say, 'It's not about my lack of competence, but because I wasn't willing to do the unethical things that they did.' "
Aaron Ben-Ze'ev, a philosophy professor at the University of Haifa, in Israel, and the organizer of a 1997 Pleasure in Other's Misfortune Conference at the university, said the people we envy most are those closest to us.
"You will envy more a colleague of yours who makes a thousand dollars more a year than you will a C.E.O. who makes a million dollars more than you," he said. "We also care about famous people. They are symbols to us." 
From the point of view of evolutionary psychologists, it's not so much that celebrities are symbols as that we think of them as our peers. Professor Tooby argues that our brains are hard-wired for the small social groups to which humans were limited since caveman days. The information age of the last 50 years -- an "eye-blink," in evolutionary terms, Professor Tooby said -- has complicated matters by making us feel close to, and sometimes competitive with, people we don't actually know.
"Part of our mind knows we've never met Martha Stewart, but another part thinks she's part of our small social world," Professor Tooby said. "You see them on TV. You think you know them."
"The glee against Martha Stewart," Professor Tooby said, "is because there's something slightly grating about the socially competitive way she goes about telling you how you should live." Her implicit message is, he said, "You might attain something above where you presently are but not above me."
"There's a certain eagerness to see an event in her life which lowers her status," he added.
When that event comes, say, in the form of a Congressional investigation into possible insider trading, the argument goes, people are prone to the same emotions they might experience if that overpaid colleague of theirs got into trouble with the boss.
Of course, not everyone feels schadenfreude at the same events or to the same degree. Research has shown that people with low self-esteem are more susceptible to schadenfreude than those whose self-regard is high. And while some may bask in this glee unapologetically, others might quickly feel ashamed of it, and successfully shut off their schadenfreude valves.
This research may actually prove useful to those fallen titans who find themselves on the receiving end of the emotion. "If the person who's getting pleasure from your misfortune doesn't understand why, then you may get some small satisfaction in telling them about their ignoble feelings," Professor Smith said.
And if his theory is correct, there may be another bright side to being the object of schadenfreude. "If you experience misfortune," he said, "at least they won't envy you anymore."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; 
Europeans May Hold Their Fire on U.S. Steel Tariffs

BYLINE:  By PAUL MELLER 

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Aug. 23 

 BODY:
European Union officials hinted today that the union might put off retaliating against United States steel tariffs until next year, signaling that Washington may have bought itself some time by greatly narrowing the scope of the disputed tariffs.
 The European Commission, the executive body of the union, said today that it welcomed a decision by the Bush administration, announced on Thursday, to exempt 178 more product categories from the protective tariffs it imposed in March, bringing the total number of exempted products to 727. 
 More than half the European steel exports to the United States originally covered by the tariffs, which will last three years and range from 8 percent to 30 percent, have now been exempted, the commission said.
Pascal Lamy, the European commissioner responsible for trade, urged today that the remaining tariffs be withdrawn "soonest, and in any event immediately after the decision of the panel condemning the U.S. measures." He referred to a World Trade Organization panel that is evaluating whether the United States tariffs are permissible under global trade rules. The panel, acting on complaints from the union and from other affected nations including Brazil and South Korea, is widely expected to reject the tariffs sometime next year. 
"The decision to exclude many E.U. products from the U.S. safeguard measures will help both E.U. exports and those many industries in the U.S. which need high-quality imports from Europe," Mr. Lamy said. "Let us hope that the next step will be action to restructure that part of the U.S. steel industry which has traditionally been behind the adoption of protectionist measures."
Government ministers of the union's 15 member nations are scheduled to decide next month whether to go through with short-term retaliatory tariffs they have threatened to impose on United States goods including textiles from the Carolinas and citrus fruit from Florida -- a list chosen for domestic political effect in the United States. The union has postponed the decision several times to allow Washington more time to address its concerns.
Officially, the union is still pursuing retaliation under the trade organization's rules. But trade experts took Mr. Lamy's remarks today as a hint that the union and the United States had reached a deal to avert rapid sanctions.
"It sounds like he is saying that they are not going to happen," said Richard Weiner, a trade specialist in the Brussels office of the Hogan & Hartson law firm. "It would be hard to imagine the ministers disagreeing with the trade commissioner." Though the remaining steel tariffs still hinder free trade, he said, the latest round of exemptions "have taken the sting out of them."
European steel producers take a dimmer view. The British-Dutch steel maker Corus urged the union to move ahead with measures against the United States. "We see no reason for the E.U. to change its stance," said Mike Hitchcock, a Corus spokesman. About 824,000 tons of Corus steel exports would have been affected by the original tariffs this year, Mr. Hitchcock said; exemptions announced since then gave relief for only 231,000 tons, or 28 percent. Mr. Hitchcock called the latest round of exemptions disappointing.
For Arcelor, the top European steel exporter to the United States, the latest round of exemptions gave relief for 70,000 tons a year, bringing the exempted total to about 23 percent of the one million tons originally affected. 
"Previous exclusions in recent months have been far from enough," said an Arcelor official in Luxembourg, where the company is based. "I imagine our official line would be unchanged after the latest offering from Washington." 
United States officials said these would be the last exemptions offered this year, though a new round will be considered between November and next March. "We will press our customers in the United States to push for further exclusions for our products the next time around," Mr. Hitchcock of Corus said. --------------------

Japan Applauds Exclusions
TOKYO, Aug. 23 (AP) -- Japanese officials applauded the decision by the United States to exclude more steel imports from protective tariffs, but they said Japan would continue to pursue its complaint against the tariffs at a World Trade Organization meeting next month.
The Japanese government had said that it would decide by the end of this month whether to retaliate over the steel tariffs, but trade ministry officials said today that the government would probably need more time to consult with Japanese steel makers first.
After the latest exemptions, only about one-third of the 2.2 million tons of annual Japanese steel exports to the United States are covered by the tariffs, trade ministry figures show.

HEADLINE: Making Way For the Big Ships; 
Recovered Since 9/11, The New York Harbor Is Awash in Cruise Liners

BYLINE:  By ELISSA GOOTMAN

 BODY:
New York's late sleepers will dream right through it. But this morning, as on most weekend days this month and next, four cruise ships are expected to dock within an hour of one another at piers along the Hudson River, depositing thousands of seafarers with sunburns, palm-tree-print shirts and rhinestone-encrusted flip-flops just off the West Side Highway.
 The city's cruise ship business, after being dealt a blow last Sept. 11, has rebounded. 
 Industry officials said the number of passengers traveling through the port this year is expected to edge above the number who sailed in or out of New York in 2000, and they are predicting that next year will be even stronger.
"Everybody was sweating bullets to think of what would happen this year," said Arthur J. Boyle, general manager of the passenger ship terminal, a concrete complex of bridges, buildings and piers off the Hudson River, from 46th to 54th Streets. "It came right back." 
These days, the terminal is a world away from the emergency command center it was converted into after Sept. 11. In fact, on the busiest days, it looks a bit like a mall on Christmas Eve.
"And my wife wonders why I don't do any Christmas shopping," Joe Farinacci, 59, a spry longshoreman from Staten Island, barked one recent morning as he maneuvered a cart loaded with suitcases through a crowd of more than 3,000 vacationers who had just disembarked from the Carnival Triumph. "I've got my own zoo here."
Or take last Sunday, when four ships docked from 7 a.m. to 8 a.m., depositing almost 5,000 passengers just in from Bermuda, Canada or, as in the case of Ronnie Italiano, 47, and 34 friends from Westchester County, from what is known as a cruise to nowhere, short trips with no ports of call.
Mr. Italiano said he had lost $1,000 in the casino of the ship, the Regal Empress, more than twice the cost of the two-day cruise. But that morning, he did not seem to mind. He was still giddy from the endless meals and the obsequious staff, he explained. 
Outside, Shaukat Jivanjee, 42, waited behind the wheel of one of the taxis lined up outside. "It's a gold mine," he said.
More than 90 percent of cruises leaving from New York go to New England, Canada, Bermuda, or simply out to sea, Mr. Boyle said. And roughly 75 percent of the people who take them, he estimated, live within a four-hour drive of the port.
Molly McPherson, a spokeswoman for the International Council of Cruise Lines, a trade group, agreed. "New York is primarily a drive-up market for cruises, as opposed to Florida, which most people fly to," she said. 
Sunday at the pier, Ellen Pufahl, 45, from Kings Park, N.Y., on Long Island, echoed a sentiment heard among many cruisers that day. 
"I don't like flying," she said, as she and her husband stood in a small crowd, guarding bags whose contents included the eight pairs of shoes she had packed for a seven-day cruise to Bermuda, not including the sparkling flip-flops she wore.
Even before Sept. 11, cruise operators said, they had begun to add departures at a variety of ports around the country, including Charleston, S.C., Philadelphia and New York. And if some potential passengers preferred to avoid a trip to the airport before Sept. 11, that desire has only crystallized since then, particularly in the Northeast.
"Instead of getting some of the people to the ships, we are now trying to bring some of the ships to the people," said Giora Israel, vice president for strategic planning for the Carnival Corporation, the country's largest cruise operator. "We see that the tri-state area represents a tremendous growth possibility for cruising."
Next spring, the 2,124-passenger Carnival Legend will offer regular eight-day cruises from New York to the Caribbean, and the 2,224-passenger Norwegian Dawn, Norwegian Cruise Line's newest, biggest ship, will also leave regularly from New York for the Bahamas and Florida.
For two cruise lines to place new ships in New York for Caribbean and Bahamas runs would have been unthinkable a year ago, said Mike Driscoll, editor of Cruise Week, a trade newsletter. "The reason they're doing this is because of the whole flying mess," he said. "Some people are afraid to fly, some just consider it too much of a hassle."
New York, to be sure, is still no Miami, the unchallenged cruise capital of the world, where more than three million passengers used the terminal last year. (Ports, including New York's, count travelers both arriving and departing, meaning that many of the passengers are counted twice.) In New York, virtually all cruises depart between mid-April and early November, while Miami is a year-round port whose high cruise season starts in early November and, this year, includes several days in which eight mega-ships, with more than 2,000 passengers each, are scheduled to dock.
Two years ago, New York had the country's fifth-largest port, in terms of cruise ship traffic. After Miami, the busiest were Port Canaveral, Fla., the closest port to Orlando and Disney World; Port Everglades, in Fort Lauderdale; and Los Angeles, according to the International Council of Cruise Lines. Last year, when ships were re-routed after Sept. 11, New York slipped into sixth place, with 165 cruises leaving the city carrying 465,000 passengers.
By the end of this year, P & O Ports North America, which runs the Hudson River terminal under an agreement with the city's Economic Development Corporation, expects that 230 cruises will have departed from New York, with passenger traffic at 630,000. That figure is slightly higher than two years ago, when 239 cruises left.
Next year, passenger traffic at the terminal is expected to exceed 750,000 people, Mr. Boyle estimated, thanks in part to the new ships. And in 2004, Cunard Line, also owned by Carnival, is expected to introduce the 2,620-passenger Queen Mary 2, which will be the world's largest ocean liner and will assume the trans-Atlantic route traveled by the Queen Elizabeth 2, from New York to Southampton, England.
To accommodate the growth, the cruise lines would like to see the passenger ship terminal refurbished and expanded. To bolster their case, the major cruise lines, together with P & O Ports, paid for a study projecting that by 2010, passenger traffic at the terminal will nearly double.
It is difficult to imagine a doubling in size of the amphibious circus for which Anthony Caputo, 47, the terminal manager, serves as ringmaster.
Mr. Caputo, who will soon succeed Mr. Boyle as general manager, easily walks 15 miles a day among the port's three usable piers as he quells spats between those caught in traffic and those directing it, and answers questions like "Where's the bus to Lumberton?"
Then there are the curve balls. These include the Norwegian Sea passenger who leapt from the dock into the Hudson to retrieve his fallen wallet, and the day the Police Department's Emerald Society Pipes and Drums band arrived, in full regalia, to perform at the wedding of a police chief's daughter aboard a Carnival ship. And then there was the woman who visited the port so often that the authorities suspected her of drug-running, a theory put to rest after she was spotted cavorting with a ship's cook.
Even on ordinary days, the eight or so hours between arriving and departing cruises are filled with luncheons for travel agents and on-board weddings, four of which took place Aug. 11 on the Nordic Empress. 
And as the last of the returnees wait outside for their rides home, a fresh batch of paler, more harried passengers filters in.
On Aug. 15, for example, a cluster of people wearing colorful plastic leis whispered and plotted in a corner of Pier 88, awaiting Kenneth and Judy Kneisel, who had been picked up from their Long Island home by a limousine for a surprise Canadian cruise to honor their retirement.
When the Kneisels arrived, there were hugs, laughs and gasps of disbelief. Then the Kneisels got in line to board the Carnival Triumph, along with 45 friends and relatives. Four members of the group had even flown up from Florida.

GRAPHIC: Photos: Along the Hudson River in Manhattan, the scene at the passenger ship terminal, which for a time was used as a command center after Sept. 11, now takes on a carnival feel on weekends, as thousands head to and return from places like Bermuda or Canada. Officials say that this year, the number of passengers traveling through the port, with its three working piers, is expected to edge above the number from 2000.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Wall Street Posts Gains For 5th Week

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday in light late summer trading but still posted their fifth consecutive weekly gain, broadening the market's recovery from its plunge to a five-year low in July.
 Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was about 400 million shares below the daily average for this year, and total volume for the week was the lowest since the four-day week after Memorial Day. 
 There was no significant new economic data released this week beyond the report that the Index of Leading Economic Indicators declined in July, so there was little for investors to consider.
But comments on Wednesday from three Federal Reserve officials may have undermined the hopes of some investors for a rate cut that would bolster both the economy and stocks. All three officials said that the Fed's benchmark short-term interest rate, which is now 1.75 percent, was low enough to keep the recovery going. 
"There were a lot of pent-up expectations for a Fed rate cut," said William E. Rhodes, chief investment strategist of Rhodes Analytics in Boston. And now, he said, those expectations may be disappointed.
Mr. Rhodes is still worried that valuations, or price-to-earnings ratios, in the overall market are still too high for this rally to go much further. In fact, the Dow Jones industrial average, which managed to climb above 9,000 for the first time in six weeks on Thursday, fell below that level again yesterday.
At the close, the Dow was off 180.68 points, or 2 percent, to 8,872.96, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 21.84 points, or 2.3 percent, to 940.86. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 42.33 points, or 3 percent, to 1,380.62. The Dow was still up 1.1 percent for the week; the S.& P. 500 was up 1.3 percent, and the Nasdaq was up 1.4 percent.
In the bond market, prices rose and yields, which move in the opposite direction, declined as some investors moved to bonds as stocks fell. The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note dropped to 4.24 percent from 4.31 percent on Thursday and 4.33 percent a week ago. The price rose 16/32, to 101 3/32. The yield on the 30-year bond fell to 5.02 percent from 5.09 percent. Its price rose 1 2/32, to 105 9/32.
Citigroup fell after AT&T said that it had received a subpoena from the New York attorney general in connection with an investigation of Jack Grubman, the former telecommunications analyst for Salomon Smith Barney, a unit of Citigroup. The investigation is looking into whether Mr. Grubman raised his stock rating on AT&T to help the investment bank obtain underwriting business from the company. Mr. Grubman resigned on Aug. 15.
Citigroup fell $1.18, or 3.4 percent, to $34.
AOL Time Warner was down sharply after a strong rally last week and another move higher through Thursday. The New York Times reported yesterday that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into AOL Time Warner's complex swap transactions with Qwest Communications International and WorldCom. AOL Time Warner, Qwest and WorldCom are all under separate investigations by the S.E.C.
AOL Time Warner finished down $1.31, or 9.3 percent, at $12.76.
General Motors fell $1.40, or 2.8 percent, to $47.92 after reports that a dealer said G.M. would end its no-interest loans after Sept. 3. The dealer, Russ Shelton of Rochester Hills, Mich., said new incentives would have interest rates of 1.9 percent for 36 months and 48 months and 2.9 percent for 60 months, according to Bloomberg News. The Ford Motor Company said last week that it would extend zero percent financing through Sept. 30, but its stock was still down 39 cents, or 3.2 percent, to $11.78.
The market was also led lower by declines in Microsoft, Intel, Philip Morris and Boeing. 
Tyson Foods and Pilgrim's Pride both jumped higher after the United States and Russia settled a dispute over chicken parts that had blocked American exports to the huge Russian market for six months. Tyson rose $1.38, or 13 percent, to $12.02, while Pilgrim's Pride finished up 59 cents, or 6.4 percent, at $9.86.
Citing health concerns with the processing of American chicken, Russia banned poultry imports from the United States from March 10 until April 15 and then stymied imports by canceling all trade permits. As a result, chicken exports to Russia fell 29 percent in the first six months of the year.
One sign of the fading hope for a Fed rate cut was the switch in forecasts yesterday by Deutsche Bank. Earlier this month, the bank said it expected the Fed to cut rates by half a percentage point at its September meeting of policy makers. But now the chances for that cut have fallen below 50 percent, it said.
"We now see the Fed as more likely to tough it out without a rate cut at the September meeting," Peter C. Hooper, the bank's chief United States economist, wrote in a note to clients. "The economic numbers have firmed a bit most recently, financial markets have rallied impressively, and the recent Fedspeak has suggested the Fed is less inclined than we had thought to be pre-emptive at this juncture."
But he said a rate cut later this year was still possible, although he acknowledged that "the odds are close and much depends on the consumer."

HEADLINE: A Comeback for Sports Fields 

 BODY:
At a time when an obesity epidemic has placed so many children at risk of disorders like heart disease and diabetes, cash-poor schools are unable to offer many places for exercise and games. Crowded urban districts in particular have been forced to convert gyms into classroom space while ceasing to maintain athletic fields. 
 Private-public partnerships can help, and an innovative not-for-profit organization in New York City called Take the Field provides a model. The organization, whose founders include experts in community development and sports, takes on the renovation of battered city fields, bypassing a school construction process that is notorious for cost overruns and delays. To underwrite these projects the city provides $3 for every dollar that Take the Field is able to raise privately. 
 Many of the city's public high school football and baseball fields have been unusable for decades, some as long as 50 years. Using its members' expertise, Take the Field has restored 20 school fields in about two years and is aiming for a total of 45 over the next two years. The fields are also made available to neighborhood athletic leagues and to people who wish to exercise. 
The group's longer-term plans include renovating four former armories around the city. These buildings' cavernous interior spaces will be converted to recreational and educational facilities. They will serve schools as well as private citizens, and each is projected to be used by as many as 100,000 people.

HEADLINE: Ferries to Manhattan From Queens to Resume 

BYLINE:  By TERRY PRISTIN

 BODY:
Ferry service from Long Island City in Queens to Manhattan, which was discontinued early last year for lack of customers, will resume Sept. 3, officials of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said yesterday. Passengers will ride free the first week.
 Every 15 minutes during rush hour, two high-speed ferries will travel between Hunters Point in Long Island City and Lower Manhattan, and a third ferry will make the trip from Long Island City to the pier at East 34th Street. At other times, the ferries will leave at half-hour intervals and make the two stops. 
 The ferries will be operated by New York Waterway, which recently bought two 97-passenger boats that can get from Hunters Point to Wall Street in eight minutes, said Arthur E. Imperatore Jr., the company president.
The trip to Midtown Manhattan is expected to take under five minutes. One-way fares will be $5 to Wall Street ($150 for a one-month pass) and $3 to Midtown ($80 for one month).
The Hunters Point ferry service will be subsidized for at least six months by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as part of its program to assist commuters whose travel patterns were disrupted by the Sept. 11 attack, said Brad Gair, the federal recovery officer for the World Trade Center.
Details of the subsidy have not yet been worked out, but Mr. Gair said the federal agency was expected to pay the operating costs of the ferry minus the revenue at the farebox.
Mr. Imperatore estimated that a minimum of 1,200 one-way trips daily would be required for the service to break even. He said that he expected to succeed in Long Island City this time because of the new high-speed boats and the addition of the downtown route to what was previously service only to Midtown.
"The market for Midtown is very different," Mr. Imperatore said. "I don't know that Midtown service even now will be successful. It's hard to compete with the subways."
To encourage commuters from Nassau and Suffolk Counties to use the ferry, the Long Island Rail Road has increased service to its Long Island City station at Borden Avenue and Second Street, said Brian P. Dolan, a railroad spokesman. Shuttle buses will transport passengers from the train station to the ferry landing. Shuttle transportation will also be provided to the Vernon Boulevard-Jackson Avenue subway station.
State and city officials said the ferry service would enhance efforts to attract more residential and commercial development to Long Island City. Since 1997, two residential towers with a total of 894 apartments have been built near the waterfront and thousands of additional units are planned.
City officials have said that one of their top economic-development priorities is to create a central business district in Long Island City that can compete for office space with New Jersey.
The new service also represents another boost for New York Waterway, which was awarded the Hunters Point contract in 1994 by the port authority. Since Sept. 11, ferry use in New York has doubled, with about 65,000 one-way trips a day, company officials said.
In a telephone interview yesterday, Gov. George E. Pataki had warm words for the Waterway chief. Mr. Imperatore and his family have contributed more than $8,500 this year to the governor's re-election campaign, according to statements filed with the New York Board of Elections.
"He's a very successful entrepreneur who has done a tremendous job of creating a new, exciting mass-transit alternative that's really catching on," Mr. Pataki said.

HEADLINE: Lawsuits Stall Plans for a Campus in a Cow Pasture 

BYLINE:  By NICK MADIGAN 

DATELINE: MERCED, Calif., Aug. 21 

 BODY:
A seven-year-old effort to begin construction on a new University of California campus in the cow pastures near this Central Valley town is floundering in a sea of lawsuits, most of them driven by a desire to protect an endangered one-inch-long crustacean, the fairy shrimp.
 Environmentalists are concerned because the $400 million project would devastate thousands of vernal pools that are home not only to the fairy shrimp but also to dozens of other endangered or threatened species. The pools -- pockets of water that form atop impermeable rock after rain showers -- also serve as temporary habitat to countless migratory birds. 
 As each month passes with no groundbreaking in sight, hopes among business owners and residents of Merced, a town of 65,000 that has been in the economic doldrums since the closing of nearby Castle Air Force Base seven years ago, continue to decline. Rows of storefronts on Main Street remain empty. 
"It was all supposed to be done a long time ago," Jackie Melander, co-owner of Steve's Bait Shack on Main Street, said of the groundbreaking. "People want to know what's going on." 
University officials announced early this year that ground would be broken in May. May came and went, and the new date was set for October. Now a court hearing on Oct. 1 could force yet another postponement.
Further, "there are still two or three years of science yet to do before we issue a permit" to build on that part of the proposed 910-acre campus where the vernal pools lie, said Jim Taylor, a spokesman for the Army Corps of Engineers, which oversees the process under terms of the Endangered Species Act.
To get the permit, university officials must agree to recreate many of the vernal pools destroyed in construction. Those officials got some good news this week when the Fish and Wildlife Service determined that as a result, development of the Merced campus, northeast of town, would not irrevocably harm endangered species in the long term. The agency's report is to be forwarded to the Corps of Engineers by early next week.
In the meantime, the university has begun some site preparation work on a 200-acre former golf course that it bought next to the wetlands; no approval was needed for that work, primarily because the land was developed long ago, its vernal pools already filled in.
The university plans to put the campus's first three buildings on the golf course site. Opponents are crying foul, saying that once those buildings have been completed, officials will feel extraordinarily pressured to allow the university to build on the wetlands.
Steve Burke, founder of Protect Our Water, one of three leading plaintiffs in the suit set for the Oct. 1 hearing, calls the pastures "a bad place to pick for a campus."
"What they're really asking for," Mr. Burke said of university officials, "is a new town with a campus. It would be smack dab in the middle of a largely untouched agricultural area. It's the closest thing to wilderness in the Central Valley, but they figured from the beginning that political might and pressure would carry the day."
The university remains unfazed.
"We're a public institution, so everybody gets to take a whack at us," said James E. Grant, a spokesman for the university, which reviewed 85 potential sites before settling on Merced as the home for the system's 10th campus. "Building anything this size in California is painful. You've got to be an eternal optimist."
The University of California has long wanted to build a campus in the Central Valley. The area is already served by three California State University campuses but is home to some 3.5 million people, a figure that is expected to jump to 10 million by 2020.
The last three campuses established by the University of California -- in Santa Cruz, Irvine and San Diego -- were built in the 1960's, before adoption of the California Environmental Quality Act or the federal Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act and Environmental Protection Act. Now, university officials acknowledge, it is much harder to get permission to build.
If the Merced project goes ahead, plans are for 25,000 students to occupy the campus's classrooms by the time it is completed, in about three decades. 
Residents' hopes that construction and subsequent enrollment will revive the flagging fortunes of businesses may be dashed if the project is held up much longer, as appears likely. Still, there are optimists.
"I think it's going to boom here," said Kortney Rogers, 29, manager of the Park Place Grille, who moved to Merced from Ventura in January to live with her fiance. "Two years ago, when I first started coming here, there was nothing -- no live entertainment, no outdoor seating in restaurants, nothing. Sometimes we'd go driving, but how many cows can you look at? 'Oh, look, honey. That one has a different spot!' " 
Other residents are conflicted. They want the campus for the business it will bring, but they do not want the town to change all that much. "I'd hate to see it lose its charm," Candi Whaley, a 21-year-old massage therapist, said while strolling downtown. "Eventually every town has to grow, but it would be nice for it to remain unique."

HEADLINE: Newark Approves Arena Financing Deal 

BYLINE:  By RONALD SMOTHERS

DATELINE: NEWARK, Aug. 23 

 BODY:
Newark's City Council tonight approved a tentative deal with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey that could help the city finance a proposed downtown sports arena without assistance from the State Legislature -- a hurdle that has blocked an arena for the last two years.
 The agreement, which also needs Port Authority approval, would be a partial settlement of a longstanding dispute over the rent the authority pays for Newark International Airport, which the city owns and the agency operates. 
 The City Council passed the measure in a 9-0 vote during an emergency meeting tonight.
The deal would immediately provide the city with $265 million. That could relieve both Newark and Gov. James E. McGreevey from seeking support for the project from the State Segislature, which has been unwilling on three occasions in the last two years to provide funds or create financing mechanisms for the arena plan. 
The proposed settlement would also formalize the strong local opposition to the proposal, announced this week, to rename the airport Liberty International Airport at Newark in honor of the victims of the attack on the World Trade Center. Mayor Sharpe James and others have said that such a change would minimize the city's identification with the airport.
The proposed new lease with the Port Authority would prohibit any change in the name other than Newark Liberty International Airport.
Peter Yerkes, a spokesman for the Port Authority, confirmed that lease negotiations with the city were continuing, but would not comment on discussions over the name change. City officials have said that according to terms of the current lease, such a change was solely a prerogative of the city.
Mayor James, emerging from daylong negotiations with the Council and with Port Authority and McGreevey administration officials, said that the advantages for the arena and economic development were not the most important features of the partial settlement of the dispute, which has been in the federal courts for several years. Its primary benefit, he said, would be to provide money to close a more than $50 million city budget gap and prevent increases in local property taxes and the layoff of 300 to 400 police officers and firefighters.
An additional $37 million would be set aside, he said, to offset the expected impact of a long-delayed revaluation of Newark properties. In all, the city would seek $100 million for these purposes, leaving $165 million available for what he called "economic development" projects that could include the arena.
But the mayor seemed intent on selling the deal to the City Council by emphasizing the help it would provide in closing the budget gap and preventing tax increases -- the Council's biggest concerns.
"The priority here is balancing the budget," Mayor James said. "We have attached no particular economic development project to the additional funding that this will provide."
Despite the Mayor's insistence on the primacy of budget balancing, officials familiar with the negotiations pointed out that the $165 million for economic development equaled the amount the McGreevey administration had proposed to borrow to aid development of the hoped-for $355 million arena for the New Jersey Nets and Devils.
Under that plan the YankeeNets, owners of the two teams, would provide $125 million, with the city and Essex County contributing $50 million. The remainder would be in loans from the teams and from the Port Authority.
In addition to the similarity between the state contribution to the arena and the settlement's economic development money, Mayor James, perhaps inadvertently, gave other clues to the money's eventual use.
In describing provisions of the agreement, which would allow the Port Authority to pay the economic development part of the settlement in installments, he noted that it would amount to $12.5 million a year for 35 years. That amount coincides with previous state estimates of the annual debt service they would have incurred from borrowing money to help build the arena.
If approved, the settlement would go a long way toward advancing the long-pending and much-criticized arena proposal, which had seemed on its last legs after it failed to win approval in a special legislative session in June. 
Despite support from Governor McGreevey, the plan foundered on antipathy among some in the Legislature toward the state's largest city and on concerns among Republicans and Democrats outside the Newark area that it would obligate state taxpayers should the project not support itself.
