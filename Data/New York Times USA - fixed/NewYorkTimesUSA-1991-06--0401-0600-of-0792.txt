HEADLINE: Democrats Meet To Plot Strategy For '92 Election

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL ,Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIDDLEBURG, Va., June 14

 BODY:
Several of the Democratic Party's most likely Presidential hopefuls retreated to an estate in the exclusive hunt country here today to begin plotting how they might wrest the White House from the Republicans in 1992.
Although the overnight meeting included 21 of the party's most reliable contributors, and although some promises were made, Democratic party officials said afterward that it was less a fund-raising event than a strategy meeting intended to give Democrats an "early start." 
 "It is clear to us that President Bush is very vulnerable in 1992, because this Administration has absolutely no domestic agenda," said the Democratic National Committee's chairman, Ronald H. Brown.
 
One Declared, Several Maybes
 The meeting, held at the home of Pamela Harriman, a Democratic fund-raiser and activist, about an hour west of Washington, drew the party's one declared candidate, Paul E. Tsongas, the former Massachusetts Senator, and a number of possible candidates for 1992 or 1996: Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas; Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey; Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas; Representative Thomas S. Foley of Washington, the Speaker of the House; Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader; Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa; Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska; George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Senate majority leader, and Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th of West Virginia.
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, Senator Al Gore of Tennessee, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia, all of whom are considered possible candidates, were invited to today's meeting but said they could not attend.
Mr. Brown and others emerged from the meeting to say that they had arrived at a "preliminary strategy" and that they had agreed that Democrats should put aside intraparty rivalries and focus on organizing for the general election rather than for the primaries. They declined to give details of their new post-primary strategy.
The party's last Presidential nominee, Michael S. Dukakis, the former Massachusetts Governor, suffered in 1988, several of those present said, because there was no organized effort in place to carry his candidacy out of the Atlanta convention.
"There was not in place a coordinated campaign strategy post-convention," said Steve Grossman, who was co-chairman of Mr. Dukakis's finance committee and is the co-chairman of the new fund-raising effort, called the Democrats' Victory Campaign '92. "You can't decide on a national strategy when the Republicans were planning Willie Horton, the Pledge of Allegiance and Boston Harbor 12 to 18 months before."
Party leaders have said they hope to at least match their 1988 fund raising but they would not disclose any goal that has been set. The Democrats raised about $50 million for the 1988 general election campaign, in addition to the $46.1 million provided by the Federal Government.
 
Looking at Opinion Polls
 The Democrats have also taken heart from recent public and private polls that show a significant disparity between the numbers of Americans who say they approve of President Bush's overall performance, especially on foreign policy, and those who say they are content with the nation's domestic health.
In a New York Times/CBS News Poll conducted last week, 75 percent of those surveyed said they approved of the way Mr. Bush was handling his job. But 57 percent said they thought the economy was fairly bad or very bad.
Mr. Clinton said party leaders hoped to seize on these perceived weaknesses in Mr. Bush's armor of popularity to regain the White House. He said they must capitalize on working people's concerns about health care, the economy and education.
"They're worried that their schools aren't very good and when they get out of them they won't be able to afford to send them to college," Mr. Clinton said.

HEADLINE: Pressed Lawmakers Report Sharp Declines in Speaking Fees

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 14

 BODY:
Under attack for their ties to special interests, members of the House and Senate reported significant declines in the speaking fees they accepted last year from corporations and other groups affected by legislation.
The annual disclosure reports made public today showed that in 1990, the last year that House members legally permitted themselves to take speaking fees, they collected a total of $5.6 million, a computer-aided analysis by The New York Times shows. That is a decline of close to $1 million, or nearly 13 percent, from the previous year. 
 Sixty-four senators accepted $2 million last year in payments for speaking engagements. That, too, was a dip from 1989, when senators took in more than $2.7 million, a drop of about 25 percent.
 
Increasing Sensitivity
 After years of escalating payments of speaking fees, the decline last year occurred in part because more members have become increasingly sensitive about ethical questions that could be raised and have refused the payments. Some who did take the fees were more careful about the number of appearances they made and what groups they appeared before.
The decline could also be due in part to the weakened economy last year, with organizations trimming appearance fees from their budgets.
"That's a substantial decline," said David B. Magleby, a professor at Brigham Young University who specializes in campaign finance. "A lot of members had grown accustomed to the fees. For it to have declined that much means that there must have been a sense that this was less and less acceptable. Everybody's a little squeamish."
In a largely symbolic vote, members of the Senate went on record last month to join the House and ban outside fees, predominantly for speaking and to a small degree for writing.
 
Fees and Donations
 In 1990 House members could keep up to $26,850 in speaking fees -- 30 percent of their Congressional salaries for the previous year -- and had to donate any amount received above that to charity, for which they can take a tax deduction. Senators could keep 27 percent of their annual pay, or $27,300 for most members. Some lawmakers donated the fees to charity even when they did not have to.
The documents also show that the most influential members were the most successful in supplementing their incomes with outside fees.
Senator Ernest F. Hollings, a South Carolina Democrat who is chairman of the Commerce Committee, led the Senate in speaking fees, taking in $82,200. He had to give away $55,212 to charity, and he did. Senator Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming, the Republican whip, ranked second, accepting $78,900 and giving $51,967 to charity.
Third was Bob Dole, the Senate Republican leader, who was paid $78,100 for 43 speeches and three newspaper articles and kept $30,400. George J. Mitchell, the Senate Democratic leader, accepted $40,000 for 20 speeches and gave $10,000 of it to charity. As leaders, Mr. Mitchell's and Mr. Dole's salaries are higher than those of other members and therefore their speaking fee limits were also higher.
 
Rostenkowski Far Ahead
 Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who heads the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, continued his tradition of drawing by far the most in speaking fees. He accepted $309,850 from 66 groups, and then gave $283,000 to charity.
Those paying Mr. Rostenkowski included the Harry Walker Agency, $12,000; Public Securities Association, $7,500; Health Insurance Association of America, $7,500; National Soft Drink Association, $7,500, and National Association of Broadcasters, $5,500.
A distant second was Representative Patricia Schroeder, a Colorado Democrat who is a leading spokeswoman on womens' issues and who considered running for President in 1988. She earned $157,696 in fees and donated $131,280 to charity. The House Speaker, Thomas S. Foley, took in $30,000, while Robert H. Michel, the House Republican leader, accepted $56,650 and donated $27,650.
When they pass speaking fees on to charity, members can generate good will in their districts through those donations.
"Most of it goes to charities in my district," Ms. Schroeder said of the fees she earned. "We have a Pat Schroeder scholarship for displaced homemakers at the University of Colorado. I give money to some of the universities and Planned Parenthood and child care and all sorts of things."
Senators this year receive an annual salary of $101,900, while representatives get $125,100.
 
Many Trips Accepted
 Beginning this year, House members got a pay rise in return for forsaking speaking fees, though they continue to accept expense-paid trips from interest groups. The 1990 disclosure reports were full of examples of members' accepting trips both to tropical vacation spots and to places where they could learn something.
Several members cited a charity golf tournament at the Greenbrier, a Virginia resort, while others reported that the German Marshall Plan Foundation had brought them to Germany for a week of "fact-finding."
The Aspen Institute, a private group that sponsored many lawmakers' trips, paid for a six-day trip for Representative Constance A. Morella, Republican of Maryland, to travel to Bermuda for a conference on Southern Africa. Shorter, less exotic trips were more common, like Dean Witter paying Representative Mike Synar, an Oklahoma Democrat, air fare from Washington to New York to give a speech.
Some members were particularly sensitive about their finances, to the point of reporting gifts under $100 that do not have to be disclosed. Representative Alex McMillan, a North Carolina Republican, attached a six-page list of gifts to his report, including four almond crescent cookies, a dozen heart-shaped sugar cookies and a banana valued at 25 cents from a group called "People Protecting Primates." Representative Jolene Unsoeld, a Washington Democrat, reported receiving a $5 surgical shirt from the Service Employees Union and $10 worth of pistachio nuts from the Paralyzed Veterans of America.
 
Special Effort by Riegle
 One senator who was especially forthcoming in his disclosure report was Donald W. Riegle Jr., a Michigan Democrat. Earlier this year, Mr. Riegle was given only a a mild sanction from the Senate Ethics Committee for his efforts to help Charles H. Keating Jr., a major contributor who operated a troubled savings and loan institution.
In his report, Mr. Riegle noted that it "provides specific detail beyond that required under Senate disclosure rules." The report also said that Mr. Riegle's "net worth figure includes items normally omitted by members." For example, the Senator listed the exact value of his home in McLean, Va. -- at $272,500 -- though he was only required to place its value in a general range.
Many more lawmakers chose not to take speaking fees last year. According to a tally by Common Cause, a group that lobbies for tightening ethics rules, 39 senators no longer accept the fees for personal use, an increase of eight over last year. The House disclosure forms made public today showed that 292 of the 435 members took speaking fees in 1990. But several more may have accepted fees; 21 members have been granted extensions on filing their disclosure reports.
Dozens of members said they received from General Motors free videotaped copies of the public television program, "The Civil War." But there were wide variations as to how much the videos were worth, with member estimates ranging from $120 to $395.

MOSBACHER ACCEPTED TRIPS
 WASHINGTON, June 14 (AP) -- Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher accepted plane trips to Europe and the Caribbean and a cruise on the Queen Elizabeth II from an investor, a business group and others last year, according to his financial disclosure statement released today.
Mr. Mosbacher and his wife, Georgette, sailed on the British luxury liner last October from New York to Tangiers, Morocco, and Southampton, England, the statement shows. The five-day trip, valued at $5,500, was paid for by the Young Presidents' Organization, a business group based in Irving, Tex.
Both Mosbachers spoke at seminars during the cruise, which was part of the group's university education program, said Elaine Vitt, spokeswoman for the group.
It is legal for Mr. Mosbacher and his wife to accept the trips, but some critics contend they should not.
"It is inappropriate for public officials to travel at the expense of private interests, and particularly private interests that have business before those officials," said David Eppler, a lawyer for the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen.

HEADLINE: Burned Out in Bergenfield

TEENAGE WASTELAND
Suburbia's Dead End Kids.
By Donna Gaines.
262 pp. New York: Pantheon Books. $23.  
 When four teen-agers committed collective suicide in the blue-collar suburb of Bergenfield, N.J., in March 1987, Donna Gaines responded with both sorrow and memory. Ms. Gaines, a sociologist and journalist who writes for The Village Voice, had worked as a "street counselor" for troubled adolescents on Long Island. And, more important, she had grown up amid drugs and anomie nearly 20 years earlier, and had seen friends wind up addicted, in detoxification centers or dead.
She brought her academic credentials and her human empathy to Bergenfield, less to unravel the reason four young people deliberately locked themselves inside a garage with their car running than to understand and illuminate the broader culture of the people she calls "burnouts." She sees in them a certain rebellious dignity, a disdain for the hypocrisy they perceive in school and family. Their allegiances belong only to one another and to the heavy metal bands, like Metallica, that articulate their despair.
It is Ms. Gaines's provocative thesis that in postindustrial America these working-class children are denied the real or metaphorical mobility that could liberate them from their limited lives. The wanderlust and social experiments of the 1960's, which the author credits with rescuing her from desperation, were no longer options once the guns-and-butter economy that undergirded them slid into recession. The boom of the 1980's saw a decline in meaningful and remunerative work for high school graduates, leaving little besides fast-food and gas station jobs. Drug abuse, alcoholism and even suicide, Ms. Gaines argues, are the symptoms of a larger cultural and economic disease.
"In the scheme of things," she writes, "average American kids who don't have rich or well-connected parents have had these choices: Play the game and try to get ahead. Do what your parents did -- work yourself to death at a menial job and find solace in beer, God, or family. Or take risks, cut deals, or break the law. The Reagan years made it hard for kids to 'put their noses to the grindstone' as their parents had. Like everyone, these people hoped for better lives. But they lived in an age of inflated expectations and diminishing returns. Big and fast money was everywhere, and ever out of reach. America now had an economy that worked sort of like a cocaine high -- propped up by hot air and big debt. The substance was absent. People's lives were like that too, and at times they were crashing hard."
There is wisdom and pathos in such words; in her way, Ms. Gaines is writing about the sons and daughters of the characters in Russell Banks and Raymond Carver's fiction. She wants to bring alive these children -- girls clinging to fantasies of happy marriage, boys dreaming of rock-and-roll stardom, all of them endlessly cruising Bergenfield's main street in search of some cathartic party.
The problem is that Ms. Gaines spends too much prose establishing her own burnout credentials and not enough letting her subjects tell their own stories. She misses no chance to show off her knowledge of rock-and-roll, taking the book's title, "Teenage Wasteland," from the chorus in the Who's anthem "Baba O'Reilly," and managing in the acknowledgments alone to drop the names of Lou Reed and Led Zeppelin. Countless times during the narrative she depicts herself trading heavy metal tapes with the Bergenfield boys and swapping makeup tips with their girlfriends. Yet when a boy awkwardly (and to my mind understandably) propositions her, she declares, "This move is really off the wall." His confusion about her motives says something larger about the confusion that hobbles this book and leaves its promise terribly unfulfilled: does Ms. Gaines want to understand Bergenfield's burnouts, or to be one of them?
Her inconsistent position extends to the prose itself. At times, Ms. Gaines writes with great common sense and a welcome contempt for child-development jargon. Her analysis of the special education system into which her subjects periodically disappear is particularly withering, while her respectful portraits of vocational education teachers and even military recruiters demonstrate an open mind at work. All too often, however, she describes Bergenfield and its teen-agers with a faux hip tone that strikes me as an unintentional kind of slumming. Consider one typical example: "A group of about seven teenagers are sitting around a truck in front of the 7-Eleven. Burnouts. I know from the pose, the clothes, the turf. Yep, in another age they'd be hitters or greasers or hippies or heads or freaks. On another coast -- they'd be stoners. Archenemies of jocks, dexters, rah-rahs, or socs for all eternity."
A powerful book dwells within this manuscript, and the tragedy is that neither Ms. Gaines nor her editor could extract it from the surrounding self-indulgence. In trying to make us care for these easily scorned youths, the author makes her presence and her actions so central to the text that at its end only she -- the outsider, the interloper -- emerges as an affecting three-dimensional character.

HEADLINE: Postings: Bigger Plans on Hold;
Range With a River View

 BODY:
Ten years ago, Arthur E. Imperatore bought a 350-acre strip of property along the New Jersey waterfront for $7.5 million from the liquidators of Penn Central holdings. At the time, he thought that his plans for Port Imperial, the new city he wants to build there, would be well beyond the blueprint stage by now, but the recession and other problems upset the timetable.
Undiscouraged, the onetime truck driver and now head of A-P-A Transport Corporation of North Bergen, has put a portion of his dormant riverfront land to use by opening the Port Imperial golf driving range and minature golf course. The property is in Weehawken, at the foot of the Palisades between Boulevard East and Pershing Road. 
 "I thought it would be a good conditional use of the property," said Mr. Imperatore, who still hopes to develop up to 1,200 units of housing and 9 million square feet of commercial space on his tract on the west bank of the Hudson. "Building the new range was a way of beautifying the property and at the same time gives golf enthusiasts a chance to polish their swings."
Open since May 25, the driving range and miniature course cover approximately 13 acres. The range has 45 tee stations -- 20 of which are enclosed for year-round use -- and the miniature course has 18 holes. The complex is open every day, with a bucket of 75 balls priced at $7, a bucket of 45 at $4, and no charge for the use of a golf club. Miniature golf is $5 for adults, $3.50 for children.
Plans call for a pro shop and snack bar to open later this summer. In addition to the golf range, Port Imperial also has a restaurant and 300-slip marina. Mr. Imperatore operates a ferry service between West 35th Street in Manhattan and Weehawken.

HEADLINE: Postings: Rehabilitation Struggle;
At Last, Open for Tenants

 BODY:
New York stories are often about small victories over long odds. Such a story had a happy ending in the Bronx last Tuesday when the Castle, a renovated 223-unit, seven-building complex of Tudor-style apartments at 1950 Andrews Avenue, opened for tenants after years of struggle over the management of the Federal housing rehabilitation grant that helped pay for the project.
The Castle was originally foreclosed by the city for nonpayment of taxes during the recession of the mid-70's. In the following years, a struggle dragged on between community groups and the Department of Housing Preservation and Development over ownership of the building. A group of housing activists claimed they held the mortgage on the property, while the city insisted that foreclosure was final, and picked Sydney Engel, of Lynbrook, L.I., for a gut rehabilitation. 
 The squabble delayed and almost derailed a $3.8 million rehabilitation grant under the Federal Housing Development Action Grant program the city had obtained. In the end the city won out, and lent Mr. Engel $12.7 million for the $20 million project, along with a $1.4 million grant.
In exchange for the subsidy, Mr. Engel agreed to reserve 20 percent of the apartments for low-income families, and the rest will be rented to families of moderate means.
Rents for the one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments range from $320 to $603 a month for low-income tenants, and from $536 to $736 for moderate-income families.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: Metrotech;
How Developers and City Hall Retain Big Tenants

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
TWO months ago, executives at Forest City Ratner Companies were getting nervous. Unaccustomed to big vacancies in their developments, they had a 23-story tower nearing completion at Metrotech Center in downtown Brooklyn with some 390,000 square feet yet to be leased.
"We were looking at 50,000- to 100,000-square-foot tenants," said Paul A. Travis, chief operating officer of Forest City Ratner, in Manhattan. "We thought eventually that we'd lease that space to several financial-service companies. The question was how long 'eventually' was going to be." 
 Meanwhile, not far away, executives at Bear, Stearns & Company, the financial concern, were contemplating a move of 1,500 employees from Manhattan to Jersey City or -- more likely -- Whippany, N.J., where the company owns a 55-acre site and already has data processing and other operations.
"The lease at 2 Broadway was up in three years," said James K. Lang, managing director of Bear Stearns, whose headquarters are in 245 Park Avenue, at 46th Street. "We knew that if we had to start re-educating people, now was the time to do it. The direction we were heading in was Whippany."
Then, early in May, Bruce Ratner, the president of Forest City Ratner, sent an 18- by-18-inch model of Metrotech Center to Alan C. Greenberg, chairman and chief executive of Bear Stearns.
"That was a very smart marketing move," said Sally B. Hernandez-Pinero, Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development.
Evidently.
One month later, the parties joined with Mayor David N. Dinkins at City Hall to announce that Bear Sterns would move 1,500 employees in its securities processing department -- not to New Jersey, but to 250,000 square feet in One Metrotech Center, on Jay Street, near Willoughby Street.
"It's great for Bear Stearns," Mr. Ratner said, "it's obviously super for the city, and I'm not complaining either."
The lease runs 12 years, with a 5-year option. Neither tenant nor landlord will discuss the rent. Known until recently as the BUG Building -- after its major tenant, Brooklyn Union Gas -- One Metrotech Center is to open in September. Bear Stearns will begin its move there in June 1992.
The fact that Forest City Ratner had the space in hand was critical. So was the swiftness with which the Dinkins administration put together discretionary tax benefits and energy savings. So too was the fact that 57 percent of the Bear Stearns workforce lived in Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island. And then there was Metrotech itself.
"By the time we move here next June," Mr. Lang said, "we believe the infrastructure is going to be a knockout. Whatever the preconceived notions are about downtown Brooklyn will disappear."
Metrotech is moving even more quickly than its developers had anticipated. Two Metrotech Center opened last year. The two buildings that compose the Chase Financial Services Center are well under construction. To the north, Polytechnic University, Forest City Ratner's partner in Metrotech, is completing its Center for Advanced Technology in Telecommunications and Dibner Library of Technology and Science.
All told, Metrotech now comprises 11 existing or prospective buildings on an irregular site bounded by Willoughby, Jay and Tillary Streets and Flatbush Avenue Extension. Several blocks away, at Fulton Street and Hudson Avenue, is another building that carries a Metrotech designation.
Mr. Ratner conceded that it was not unlike the tendency in Manhattan to spread a prestigious address around, such as 237 Park Avenue, which is actually on Lexington.
The size of Metrotech was a point Forest City Ratner wanted to make with the model it sent to Mr. Greenberg. "The message we were trying to get across," Mr. Travis said, "was that there is a whole complex here, not just a block of space."
Mr. Greenberg's initial reaction to the model, as Mr. Lang tells it, was, "Get this thing out of here." But the company invited Forest City Ratner to pursue its case. "When they came to our office," Mr. Lang recalled, "we said: 'Here's our spread sheet on Whippany. Meet these numbers or beat them.' "
A number of general incentives were already in place, among them:
*A 13-year exemption from real-estate taxes on the new building, after which taxes are phased in over 10 years. These savings are passed from developer to tenant.
*A 12-year elimination of the commercial rent tax, a direct benefit to the tenant.
*A 12-year corporate tax credit of $500 a year for every employee moved to Brooklyn.
But that was not yet enough.
"The only way we would go to Brooklyn -- because we figured that Brooklyn and Jersey City were roughly equal -- was if the city would do more," Mr. Lang said. James E. Cayne, president of Bear Stearns, met with the Deputy Mayor. As Mr. Lang told it, his message was: "We need relief at 245 Park or the Metrotech deal won't work. You're killing us with the real-estate taxes."
The company was startled by City Hall's quick response. "They were terrifically cooperative," Mr. Lang said. "The city bent over backward to give us some concessions."
"The challenge for us," Deputy Mayor Hernandez-Pinero said, "was to confront the attitude that said, 'Once you leave Manhattan, it doesn't matter where you go.' From our perspective, there is a world of difference between going to downtown Brooklyn and going to Whippany."
"The bulk of the benefits they're going to receive are as-of-right incentives, so we didn't do anything extraordinary," she said. "We've added a couple of discretionary items, neither of which has a direct impact on our operating budget."
One of these was an exemption on sales taxes for items with a useful life longer than a year, such as computers and communication equipment. The other was the provision of lower-cost New York Power Authority electricity to Bear Stearns headquarters.
Given the discretionary benefits, whose value Mr. Lang put at about $17 million, he said "the deal was better for the first 12 years in Brooklyn than in Whippany."
Whippany still had economic advantages in the longer run, but Bear Stearns was concerned about losing employees in a move almost 25 miles west of the city. This was particularly true since 30 percent of the workers live in Brooklyn.
"We felt a little trepidation about moving our people that far away," Mr. Lang said, although an earlier move of some 200 workers went smoothly. "We never put in the numbers on how much it would cost to replace employees, but theoretically, the farther you move out, the higher it gets."
Bear Stearns is vacating a total of 285,000 square feet in Manhattan -- 185,000 square feet in 2 Broadway, at Bowling Green; 65,000 at 866 First Avenue, between 48th and 49th Streets, and 35,000 at 245 Park Avenue.
If there is a big loser, it may be the Reichmann family of Toronto, whose Olympia & York concern owns 2 Broadway and 245 Park Avenue. "They tried very hard to effect a deal with us," Mr. Lang said. "They gave us a very favorable proposal, but over the long haul, the economics were far more favorable moving to Brooklyn." Through a spokesman, Olympia & York said it expects to re-lease the Bear Stearns space by 1994.

Resolving Disputes Over Work

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

 BODY:
ONE of the greatest fears of a homeowner about to have renovations done is a dispute with the contractor before the job is complete. There is a sense of vulnerability when walls are down, plumbing lines disrupted or windows removed.
 Fortunately, a greater acknowledgement of this problem by public officials and industry professionals is leading to speedier and more effective resolution programs. In addition, the recession is persuading more contractors to accept voluntary resolution methods that might have been spurned in the boom years of the 80's. "In these difficult times they need reconciliation," said Dave Rosehill, former chairman of the mediation committee of the New York-Long Island chapter of the National Asssociation of the Remodeling Industry. "They need to keep the good name that leads to referrals." 
 A contractor who would have refused a job because a homeowner insisted on an abitration or mediation clause in the contract now might be accept that clause because he is more anxious to get work.
 As a start, the homeowner should insist, before work begins, on some form of binding method of resolving disputes. "If something happens, you will be in a much stronger position," said William Barbera, a real estate lawyer in Pelham, N.Y.
 The clause could require the parties to submit their differences to the American Arbitration Association. This can usually result in a hearing within three weeks and a decision no longer than 30 days afterwards, said Robert Meade, vice president of program development for the association, which is based in New York City.
 Or the two sides could agree to resolve their differences through a more informal type of mediation. If so, the details should be spelled out before the job begins, say lawyers, because it can be difficult to reach agreement once a dispute has erupted.
The parties could agree to find another contractor or building consultant acceptable to both sides to review the situation and suggest a solution. Or they could agree to abide by the determination of an objective third party with suitable expertise. For example, Tauscher Cronacher, professional engineers in Rockville Centre, L.I., will provide what they call a "defects and deficiencies" report for about $400 -- a document also useful when facing arbitration or litigation. Some home inspectors do similar consulting work.
 Assuming, however, that the contract is silent regarding disputes -- or there was no contract at all -- the homeowner is still left with some options. In most instances, lawyers advise, legal action should be a last resort becaue fees can be high and there may be long delays in getting cases tried. "You may wait three years for a trial date if the amount is over $3,000," warned Mr. Barbera.
Instead, the homeowner should turn speedily to the contractor's professional association or the agency that issues his license -- if licensing is required in the area -- or both.
The likelihood of professional affiliation is increasing as more contractors join these groups to enhance their credibility. The National Remodelers Council, which began in 1962 as a division of the National Association of Home Builders, has doubled the number of local chapters, to over 100, in the last six years. Typically, members must comply with the findings of local mediation committees as a prerequisite to continued membership. Mr. Rosehill said that his chapter receives about two complaints a month.
Action is normally begun within two weeks of the receipt of a written complaint, "sooner if it's something serious like a leak," he said. He said he first makes a friendly fact-finding telephone call to each side and visits the site, if needed.
Last summer, a homeowner complained that repeated requests to the contractor about constant condensation on newly installed replacement windows got nowhere. Mr. Rosehill soon discovered that the contractor had placed the matter in the hands of his supplier without bothering to find out why the supplier had failed to notify the window manufacturer, who should have sent a representative.
 Mr. Rosehill made sure this was done. The representative soon discovered that the windows were neither faulty nor improperly installed. Rather, the homeowner had been running an air-conditioner at a setting so high that it had created condensation. A lower setting corrected the problem.
 Notifying the contractor's licensing office is equally powerful since the contractor could lose his right to continue in business if he fails to cooperate with an inquiry. The office can also be the source of information about possible reimbursement should there be no likelihood of the contractor's ever making good.
 Kenneth Rudnick, a hair stylist with a home in Huntington Station, L.I., found this out after contacting the Suffolk County Department of Consumer Affairs when his licensed contractor vanished, leaving an exterior renovation half done.
 Since it soon became apparent that the contractor would never return, Mr. Rudnick found himself eligible for $2,000 from a "restitution fund" established three years ago from licensing proceeds for just such a case. Although it was a year before he got the money, it has given him enough cash, he said, to pay someone else to finish the job.
Sixty-four other homeowners have been paid from the same fund, said Jane Devine, the Commissioner.
The idea of such a fund is now spreading to other counties and states, among them Maryland, Virginia and Hawaii.
 If an architect has been retained the homeowner should never confront the contractor directly. Rather, the architect should be used as the mediator, said John Alvarez, vice president of the Connecticut Society of Architects.
"It takes the emotional layer out of the argument and allows the architect to speak as one professional to another," he said.
 Mr. Alvarez told of a recent incident in which an homeower was angry with a contractor because the finish on a floor that had just been hand-stenciled by an artist had started to streak. The architect first researched the problem to see who was at fault and why. He found it was, indeed, the contractor, and he was able to pursuade him to redo the floor by showing him through a technical analysis why his initial attempt had gone awry.

A New Neighbor for the Maritime Center

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
RATTLED by the recession, two historic districts in South Norwalk are expected to draw strength from the restoration of a turn-of-the-century red-brick building next door to the debt-ridden Maritime Center on North Water Street.
But while city officials believe that converting the 22,000-square-foot structure into restaurants and shops is best for the area, several merchants and restaurateurs on the adjacent, one-block Washington Street Historic District are concerned about the competition. 
 "The project serves our goal of creating a human-scale, attractive environment," said Jack Burritt, director of the Norwalk Redevelopment Agency, which controls the area. "More shops and restaurants will bring about a critical mass that the specialized boutiques and bistros on Washington Street do not."
 With its blind, boarded-up facade at a right angle to the Maritime Center entrance, the city-owned building that formerly housed offices of the Hatch & Bailey Lumber Company has been an eyesore to the 460,000 people who in the last year patronized the center, with its shark tanks, IMAX Theater and boat-building and marine-life exhibits.
 Last month, Orb Management Ltd., a 20-year-old Manhattan company experienced in conversions, was designated by the Norwalk Common Council to redevelop the building with the help of the Manhattan architectural firm of Beyer Blinder Belle. Their proposal calls for two 5,000-square-foot indoor-outdoor restaurants, with the remaining space devoted to shops and offices.
 Orb is negotiating with the Redevelopment Agency on details of the $3 million project, which will eventually need approval by the Common Council and the city's planning and environmental agencies. An opening is anticipated in mid-1992.
 Because of its large financial commitment to the Maritime Center, which is in the Reed-Putnam Historic District, the city has taken a profound interest in the area. Since it opened in 1988, the center, converted from an old factory, has been unable to meet the payments on two bond issues of $23 million and $7 million, floated in 1986 and due in 2015 and 1996, respectively.
The city has been paying $3 million a year on the debt, to the consternation of Norwalk taxpayers, plus an additional $363,000 in 1990 toward operating expenses. Grants of $2.1 million from the state have also been applied to the debt.
 Last November, Peter Marnane became the center's new director, initiating features that included an automated dinosaur exhibit, concerts and lectures by celebrated naturalists.
Revenues have improved, and he said he is optimistic that "this will be the first year that we will be able to cover our operating costs of almost $6 million."
 With its excursion-boat dock and picturesque location at the mouth of the Norwalk River, the Maritime Center was expected to attract crowds that would spill over to the businesses around the corner on Washington Street.
"That has not happened," said William Elmore, proprietor of the Rialto restaurant. "We get very little traffic from the center. This started out trying to be a South Street Seaport, but the center wasn't received that well and until they make it less educational and more entertaining, people just walk through once and never come back."
 "There must be a better bonding between the city and the SoNo area," said Ralph Bloom, curator of the Norwalk Heritage Museum on East Avenue. "For example, there are no public rest rooms without paying $5 admission to the Maritime Center."
His museum was rejected by the city as a potential tenant for the Hatch & Bailey conversion.
 The Museum of Cartoon Art in Rye Brook, N.Y., also made an unsuccessful bid for tenancy, as did the Maritime Center itself. "The city was concerned about our poor financial record," Mr. Marnane explained. "Now Orb Management will make the money on food service and gift shops that we had hoped to make."
 Russell Cooper, head of the new SoNo Business Association and a third-generation store owner on Washington Street, believes that "negative opinions about the Hatch & Bailey proposal are coming from people whose businesses are in trouble anyway." Last year, he switched his 56-year-old tuxedo rental store to trendy children's wear.
"Business improved by 40 percent," Mr. Cooper recalled. "You have to stock what the customer wants."
WASHINGTON STREET was developed in the early 80's by the Collins Development Corporation of Stamford with Federal funds. Collins still owns most of the stores, and Arthur Collins, company president, said he is "very concerned."
"A greater variety of shops and restaurants will bring more people," he said.
 He has tried to stem a rising tide of vacancies by "forgiving" some of his tenants overdue rents, rather than reducing rents. Leases remain at around $15 a square foot, according to Dwight Collins, his son and a vice-president of the company.
 La Provence, Sweptaway, Donovan's, Pasta Nostra, and other popular restaurants are doing less business than a year ago, whether dinner prices for two are $40 or $20. Souvlaki, a Greek restaurant, will soon open in one of four vacant stores. There is a total of 30 retail spaces.
 Sassafras, a gift shop with a Victorian flavor, attracts a stream of browsers, and John Deorio, the owner, is worried about the Maritime Center's influence.
"They get a lot of schoolchildren, not the type of customer I need," he said. "They should have an aggressive schedule of entertainment to attract a 25-and-up age group with disposable income. To assume that more families flocking to the Maritime Center will make us fly is a fallacy."
 While the new project is a lightning rod for everyone's frustrations in the district, it is also the only one moving forward. Plans announced last year by Katz Realty for converting the old City Hall into a Maritime Inn on Main Street are moribund. A major mixed-use renovation to the Lock Building factory across the street from the center is "on the back burner," said Michael diScala, the developer. And the railroad station three blocks away, approved by the city for a $100 million, mixed-use redevelopment by the Starrett Company of Manhattan, is "not near the starting line," according to Richard Bassuk, company president.
 Susan Hewitt, a partner at Orb Management and project manager for the Norwalk undertaking, said: "Washington Street and the Maritime Center area need to regard themselves as part of the same economic unit. We want to collaborate with them to help bring that about."

HEADLINE: BROADWAY;
Great White Way Still Shimmers

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The Tony Awards held last Sunday highlighted one of New York's continuing success stories: Broadway is and has always been a beacon for actors, writers, producers, directors, musicians and dancers from all over the world. While in a given year any individual, including the Times critic Frank Rich, may judge the lights on Broadway to be "dimmer" or "brighter" ["The Great Dark Way: Slowly, the Lights Are Dimming on Broadway," June 2], it's well to remember that the marquees always shine more brilliantly here than anywhere else. 
 Broadway, Off Broadway and Off Off Broadway are not competitors, as Mr. Rich implies in skewering this year's crop of Tony nominees. Rather, they complement and reinforce one another, making the entire New York theater experience that much richer. Shows like "A Chorus Line," "Ain't Misbehavin' " and "Once on This Island," which moved from Off Broadway to Broadway, illustrate this interrelationship.
Theater is a dynamic industry that has a $1.5 billion impact on our local economy annually. More tourists come to New York to see plays and musicals than for any other single reason. And theater is part of why individuals, businesses and even industries choose to locate here permanently. The city's recognition of the history and magic of New York's theaters has led us to protect them by landmarking more than 40 playhouses and stages.
New York theater has had its ups and downs and is currently operating in the same tough financial climate that we are all experiencing. But our theater is a valuable treasure and a unique cultural and economic resource. We in the city administration believe applause and curtain calls are in order.

JURIED ART SHOW
 The Mamaroneck Artists Guild will open its 35th National Open Juried Exhibition on Friday at Westchester Community College in Valhalla. While the guild's new quarters at 2120 Boston Post Road have more exhibition space than the old gallery on Larchmont Avenue, there is still not enough room for the 248 works in the show. Paintings and sculpture in all media, fiber, jewelry and ceramics by artists from Florida to Alaska will be judged for 29 awards of $50 to $300.
 Two receptions are to be held, one from 6 to 9 P.M. Friday, the other from noon to 3 P.M. when the show closes on June 30. 
 The gallery director, Nan Walsh, said, "We are the oldest nonprofit art cooperative in the county, despite the claims of others." New members are juried into the 350-member organization each year by 17 judges. Out of 90 applicants 10 were accepted in 1990.
 Among the works on view in the Valhalla exhibition are "Cosmos," a photograph by Stan Lapa at $700; "Unfurled," a bronze by Ms. Walsh, at $5,000; "Wasn't Life Peaches and Cream?" a $3,000 collage by Marilyn Cohen; and "Dancer at Rest," a $15,000 bronze by Aaron Spiegelman. Prices start at $75. The show may be seen daily from noon to 5 P.M. Call 834-1117 for more information.
 
RECALLING TOSCANINI
 All you need to get into Tuesday's "Remembering Toscanini" program at Wave Hill in Riverdale is $1 and a few streaks of gray hair. The last of a series of events for the elderly, it will be conducted by Mortimer H. Frank, curator of the Toscanini collection at Wave Hill. "We don't proof people at the door," Mr. Frank said, "but people in their 20's probably would not feel comfortable."
 The program will survey the 17 years, from 1937 to 1954, when Toscanini conducted the NBC Symphony Orchestra. "His performance style, extraordinary talent, and his compulsiveness to push performers to limits that other conductors never dreamed of makes most of them pale in comparison," Mr. Frank said.
 He will show one complete video of a televised concert featuring Wagner's original overture to "Tannhauser" and play a recording of a rehearsal in which Toscanini shows his temper. For the final four years of the conductor's tenure at NBC the concerts were televised and recorded on kinescopes, an early and crude method of preserving picture and sound.
 "But," Mr. Frank said, "the technology was later developed to enhance the picture and transfer it to videotape, and by stripping away the sound track and replacing it with the superb sound transcriptions that were engineered at the time of the concerts, we now have excellent synchronized videos."
 The video and recording will be accompanied by Mr. Frank's commentary on various aspects of the conductor's life and work. The program begins at 1 P.M. For directions to Wave Hill or for more information call (212) 549-3200.
 
GAMES FOR FATHERS
 Father's Day at the Hammond Museum in North Salem will be celebrated today in the Great Hall with continuous games of cribbage, dominoes, chess and other board games. Visitors can come and go as they like, participating or kibitzing from 11 A.M. to 4 P.M.
 The Japanese Stroll Garden will be open for viewing and the Silk Tree Cafe will serve brunch from 11:30 A.M. to 2 P.M. for $17.50 a person. Admission to the museum is $2; children $1. For lunch reservations, call 669-8345; for directions or other information call 669-5033.
 
RIDING REFRESHER
 Adults who would like to polish their horseback riding skills can do so at the Pleasantville campus of Pace University. Two-hour sessions held Monday through Thursday evenings include handling the tack, grooming the horse and ring work with English saddles. The program ends Aug. 15.
 Riders must be able to walk, trot and canter and must sign up for a minimum of four sessions. Schedules will be tailored to meet individual needs on a weekly or daily basis and prices vary from $100 to $625, according to the number of sessions and complexity of workouts.
 Call 773-3788 for more information.
 
JAPANESE TRADE
 Don E. Newquist, commissioner of the United States International Trade Commission in Washington, will talk about "The Japanese Distribution System and Prospects for Improving U.S. Access" at a luncheon meeting of the World Trade Club of Westchester on Wednesday.
 The commission is an independent, bipartisan agency established by Congress to make determinations of injury and threats of injury to American industry by imports. It also analyzes trade data for Congress and the President as a basis for United States trade policy.
 Mr. Newquist will discuss features of the Japanese system that act as barriers to imports and a threat to economic growth in the United States posed by the closed Japanese markets.
A reception will begin at 11:45 followed by lunch at 12:15 at the Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza, 66 Hale Avenue in White Plains. Reservations at $40 may be made by calling 948-6444.
 
CELLO AND FOLK SONGS
 Eugene Friesen, a cellist with the Paul Winter Consort for eight years, has taken off on his own, incorporating poetry and scat-singing with his solo acoustic and electric cello. Accompanying him at the Towne Crier in Pawling on Friday at 9:30 P.M. will be Glen Velez, a percussionist and member of the Paul Winter Consort, and Phil Markowitz, a pianist. Admission will be $14.
 At 9:30 P.M. Saturday, the Towne Crier will present Tom Rush, a songwriter and folk singer who has made 15 albums and has filled Carnegie Hall, Symphony Hall in Boston and the Kennedy Center in Washington at recent concerts. Tickets are $17.50.
 The Towne Crier Cafe is at 66 Route 22. Call 855-1300 for reservations or more information.
 
GOLF TOURNAMENT
 Each year the Red Klein Golf Tournament is held in memory of Mr. Klein, a member for decades of the county's Recreation Department. Tee-off time for the more than 80 golfers who turn out for the event will be 7 A.M. Thursday at the Dunwoodie Golf Course in Yonkers.
 Two-man teams (it is an all-male tournament) must sign up in advance for the 18-hole competition. The entrance fee is $11, plus an $11 greens fee. Prizes worth $200 and $300 are contributed by the pro shop. For more information, call 428-0760 or 476-5151.

Exhibit Honors Blacks' Inventions

 BODY:
"The Real McCoy: African-American Invention and Innovation," an exhibition organized by the Anacostia Museum of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, begins a two-year tour in July, when it starts a three-month stay at the California Afro-American Museum in Los Angeles. The exhibition highlights early creative and scientific achievements by African-American inventors and enterpreneurs.
Artifacts, audiovisual presentations and copies of inventions show the major contributions to America's industrial and technological development. Among the inventions is the McCoy lubricator, which is a device to oil moving locomotives. The inventor, Elijah McCoy, the son of slaves who fled to Canada, put an end to the costly and time-consuming process of stopping a locomotive so it could be oiled. 
 Another inventor was Norbert Rillieux, whose commercial application of vacuum evaporation made the production of refined sugar economically feasible in this country. C. J. Walker, a washerwoman, became the first woman to be a self-made millionaire in America. In 1905, she successfully marketed a product for straightening the hair of black women, which eventually yielded her a business empire with a line of beauty products and cosmetology schools.
The exhibition will be in Los Angeles from July 15 to Oct. 27. Other cities the exhibition will visit include Kansas City, Mo.; Rochester; Fort Worth; Detroit; Tampa, Fla., and Chicago. The tour ends in Columbia, S.C., in July 1993.
Visitors to the exhibition can buy a catalogue of these and the other pioneering achievements of African-Americans. The book, "The Real McCoy: Invention and Innovation, 1619-1930" ($17.50, Smithsonian Institution Press, 1989), was written by the curator of the exhibit, Portia James, a historian at the Anacostia Museum.

HEADLINE: Campus Life: Chapman;
Plan to Require Campus Residency Angers Students

DATELINE: ORANGE, Calif.

 BODY:
Despite opposition from its student government and a protest demonstration by students last month, Chapman College will require its noncommuting undergraduates under age 21 to live in campus housing starting in the fall.
Ann Bolger, the director of residential life and acting vice provost of student life at the private college, said the policy would affect 250 students under 21 who lived in campus residence halls in the last academic year and some 300 incoming freshmen. They will be billed about $5,000 for room and board for the year. 
 Ms. Bolger added, however, that commuters who live with their parents or guardians will be exempt from the policy, and those undergraduates currently living off campus could continue to do so. Students wanting to avoid the new rules will have to plead their case by letter.
"We haven't determined these exemptions yet, but the students will at least need to demonstrate that living on campus won't benefit them as students," Ms. Bolger said.
 
Revenue Sought to Pay For Hall
 Chapman has had this residency policy for about eight years, but to coincide with the fall opening of a new residence hall, housing 300 students, college administrators decided that this was the time to start enforcing it.
"The original reason for having this policy was because the college wanted to become a residential campus," Ms. Bolger said, adding that the present administration still has this goal in mind.
"But now the college is also looking to secure a stable revenue" to pay for the new hall, which cost $6 million, Ms. Bolger said. She added that if the college did not force students to live on campus, many rooms would be empty.
"We are trying to put a stronger emphasis on campus life, and it would be better for students," she said. "Residence students persist longer, are retained in higher numbers and have higher-quality academic experiences."
 
'The Rooms Are Small'
 But some students, who say the cost of living on campus is already too high, are not so sure.
Todd A. Adams, a sophomore who organized a demonstration against the housing policy, said in an interview: "The rooms are small, the food is gross. It's really overpriced and I can't afford to live there again." He said the turnout of 50 people for the protest was high considering it was Chapman's week for final exams.
Mr. Adams, a political science and economics major from Tulsa, Okla., lived on campus last year and is obliged to do the same next year. "I have to look on down the road, so that if they say I have to pay, I'll find another school," he said.
V. Elise Bigelow, president of Associated Students, the student government, said, "Students find that their rights are being violated, and I haven't spoken to any students who are in favor of it." Because many student have reacted negatively to the residency policy, Ms. Bigelow said, Associated Students has taken a formal stand against the policy.
Ms. Bigelow, a senior political science major from Big Timber, Mont., said she was writing a proposal suggesting alternative means of keeping residence halls full without forcing students to live in them. She said she planned to deliver the proposal at the next meeting of the Chapman trustees, set for tomorrow.
Ms. Bigelow suggested that once the new residence hall was opened, Chapman could close one of its existing halls each year for renovation so that only one hall was closed at a time and all the available rooms on campus would be occupied.
"The existing halls are in poor shape in a lot of ways," Ms. Bigelow said.
But Ms. Bolger said, "I'd say they are in average condition for 20-year old buildings."

HEADLINE: Stamps

BYLINE: By Barth Healey

 BODY:
Stamp collectors pretend to be organized: they have catalogues listing when stamps were issued, complete with technical printing details and retail prices. They have albums with little squares to mount the stamps in.
They also have shoeboxes. Filling up the shoeboxes can be a lot more fun than mere obeisance to the orderliness imposed by others. 
 Every stamp show -- known to hobbyists as a bourse, a delightfully antique word -- offers the opportunity to fill another shoebox.
There has been a strong trend in recent years toward postal history -- envelopes with stamps and routing marks and the like that tell a stamp's story, where it has been and how it has been used. Once, almost all the items on dealers' tables were stamps; now there are very few dealers who do not offer postal history items as well.
A collector can survey postal history in any organized or disorganized way that appeals.
A personal favorite, and very economical, are whimsical place names found in cancellations. Envelopes and cards in this exceedingly ad hoc category can be had for a dollar or two. There is seldom any point to the purchases; they are just fun.
A few favorites at random are these:
A postcard sent during a vacation in the West in 1940, postmarked Lazy Day, Mont.
A letter sent to The Christian Herald in New York City from Saint Mary's, Pa., in 1901, an interesting link between cancel and addressee.
A 1946 letter from Vermont with a town name that matches the stereotype of the rugged New Englander: Adamant.
A postcard responding to a survey of music education in Arkansas, on which the printed stamp bears a flag cancel from Stamps, Ark. (Stamps, by the way, was the home of the writer Maya Angelou; she returned to Stamps as part of a 1982 documentary that is occasionally rerun on public television.)
Is there any logic here? No, but so what?
 Browsers are always welcome at stamp bourses. Here are some planned for today and next weekend. The shows in San Antonio today and Aurora, Colo., next weekend will offer special stamp exhibits as well.
TODAY: Sacramento, Calif., Stamp and Postcard Show, Holiday Inn, Interstate 80 and Madison Avenue.
Milford, Conn., "Third Sunday" Stamp and Coin Show, Knights of Columbus Hall, Bridgeport Avenue.
Grand Rapids, Mich., Stamp, Coin and Baseball Card Show, Rogers Plaza, 1110 28th Street.
San Antonio, Texpex '91, Municipal Auditorium, 100 Auditorium Circle.
Toronto, Stampex '91, Sheraton Center, 123 Queen Street West.
NEXT SATURDAY and SUNDAY: Anaheim, Calif., Stamp Expo '91, Grand Hotel, 1 Hotel Way, across from the entrance to Disneyland.
Aurora, Colo., Topex '91, Denver Radisson Southeast Hotel, 3200 Parker Road.
New York, Metropolitan Stamp Show, Days Inn, 440 West 57th Street in Manhattan.
Richmond, Central Virginia Stamp Bourse, Holiday Inn/Crossroads, 2000 Staples Mill Road.
Rhinelander, Wis., Northwoods Stamp and Coin Show, Nicolet College.
 
False Franking
 Two new coil stamps in the Transportation series will offer a bonanza to modern postal history fans interested in false franking. Such franking means that the value printed on a stamp does not, in fact, indicate accurately how much postage has been paid.
In the past, false franking has occurred when the Postal Service has allowed a bulk mailer to use up outdated stamps after rates changed. The difference between the old rate and the new rate is paid at the time of mailing, but there is often no marking on the envelope to indicate this.
Bulk mailers use a variety of postal rates, depending on the tax status of the mailer and the amount of pre-sorting done before mailing. Prior to the latest rate change on Feb. 3, there were at least 12 different rates.
Two stamps issued on May 25 in Secaucus, N.J., a brown 5-cent showing a canoe and a dark green 10-cent showing a tractor trailer, will now be used to cover most bulk mail rates.
The canoe stamp has the notation "Additional Nonprofit Postage Paid," and the tractor-trailer stamp has the words "Additional Presort Postage Paid." The phrases describe officially what had been the ad hoc decisions by individual postal officials.
The general public should also be pleased: printing fewer different stamps saves the Postal Service money and helps keep rates steady.

HEADLINE: ABOUT CARS;
Selling Paseo's Sizzle Between the Lines

BYLINE: By Marshall Schuon

 BODY:
THE big new thing in television advertising seems to be tongue-in-cheek subliminals. In other words, poking fun at the public's perception that advertising is getting the job done by attacking the subconscious.
There is, for instance, the double-talking big-star guy who leaves you with the uncomfortable knowledge that you have been at this viewer stuff long enough to understand even the fastest of ad-speak. 
 And then there are those (wild!) commercials for Toyota's (hot!) new Paseo. If you watched any part of the Chicago Bulls' prance through Magic's china shop, you will have seen the ads -- and you might well have seen them even if you gave Michael Jordan a pass.
The commercials for the new two-plus-two sporty coupe began with the basketball playoffs, but they are running all over the place, and they pretend to the practical while touting the tingle.
 The idea, according to a Toyota spokesman, is to go after the young-male market with a car that is sensible but exciting. The ads flash bikini images and the words "wild" and "hot" and "sexy," and all the while an announcer drones on about good basic transportation.
It might work, and Toyota is counting on 35,000 Paseo sales this year, and another 50,000 in 1992. But the proof will be in the car itself, not in what Madison Avenue says, no matter how it says it. The truth (boring and sotto voce) is that Paseo is a long way from loosely bound excitement.
The ads, in fact, may have Paseo's story exactly backward. With Toyota's latest entry, the fun actually is on the outside, and the sleek and brightly painted body wraps a core that is strictly econobox.
It is billed as a '92, so the company will have more than a year's production to brag about when it comes time to tally sales for the model year. But it also is a car that will have to fight some stiff competition in the form of the Geo Storm, Hyundai's Scoupe and Honda's CRX, all of which also have their charms.
A big part of Paseo's lure will be its palette of body colors, eight in all, and the tester was a gorgeous aqua, which Toyota calls turquoise pearl. The integrated bumpers were the same shade, and along with fared-in headlights, flush windows and close-fitting body panels, they contribute to a commendably low drag coefficient of .32.
That helps fuel efficiency, of course, and it makes the black and gray interior a quieter place. Seated behind the sport wheel with its three spokes, you survey a dash dominated by an 8,000-r.p.m. tach on the left and a 110-m.p.h. speedometer on the right.
Oddly, in a car so basic, there are surprises. Power steering is standard, as are remote latches for the trunk and fuel-filler door, and a pull-out tray offers dual cupholders. The aqua Paseo also had cruise control and air-conditioning, but you can't have power windows or central door locking or very many options at all. This is a car that is what it is.
The sideview mirrors have to be adjusted manually, as does the optional sunroof, which opens as a vent or can be removed and stowed in the trunk. Storage also must be found for the roof's opaque insert if you want the rays to penetrate the tinted glass.
Company literature makes a thing of "full-fabric" sport seats, but they too are relatively spartan and lacking in adjustment. They are also firm to the point of discomfort.
The Paseo has no airbag, which means Toyota had to find a way around the safety regulations, and the car was given passive shoulder belts, hooked to the door in the way that Volkswagen and Honda used to do it. These, though, are cumbersome, and you have to force your way under them and fight your way into the car.
There are a number of nice things to say, however. Storage is relatively good, with a big glove box and a couple of cubbyholes in the dash, which has a tray molded into its top. A console between the buckets contains the shifter and parking brake, and there is a fold-down rear seat that offers a sizable passthrough for long objects in the trunk.
Most cars as small as this also make the mere idea of rear seats a bad joke. In the Paseo, there is actual room back there, although passengers shouldn't be expected to smile if the trip is going to be more than a quick ride home.
And the word "quick" does have its place when you talk about the Paseo. Under the hood, the little 1.5-liter engine sports twin cams, four valves for each of its four cylinders, and fuel injection, and it puts out an even 100 horsepower.
That is quite sufficient in a car that barely nudges the needle of the scale above 2,000 pounds, and that comes equipped with a five-speed stick or an optional automatic that is electronically in tune with the engine. It might be said that Paseo walks away smartly.
It does that, too, with excellent economy, and mileage is rated at 28 city, and 34 highway. When you combine that with a base price (and a realistic one, since there are few options), of only $9,988, you have a car that delivers its own message. It doesn't need too many parentheses.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
Confusion Reigns in Tokyo

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
This has not been a good year for the Tokyo stock market. But it has probably been even worse for the forecasters, economists and analysts who attempt to predict the market's course.
Tokyo had been hit by a market crash early in 1990 and again by the Persian Gulf crisis later in the year. And it is still staggering, lagging way behind the recovery of markets in many other countries, including the United States. The Nikkei index of 225 leading shares, which closed on Friday at 25,093.89, needs to rally 23 percent to regain its level of 30,837.99 before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August and 55 percent to catch the record high of 38,915.87 that it reached on the last trading day of 1989. 
 As for the forecasters, they have been counting on a cut in interest rates to give the market a spark. This assumption is behind current forecasts that have the Nikkei 225 rising 8 percent to 20 percent, or roughly to 27,000 to 30,000, relatively soon.
Some analysts expected the interest rate cut in the first quarter of the year; some, in the second quarter. Well, it is already June, and interest rates have not been cut.
Many who have been predicting the cut will now be hoping for it in the third quarter. And some may delay the due date of the reduction in the official discount rate, which is now 6 percent, until the end of the year.
For investors, this leaves the outlook for the Japanese stock market quite murky -- and risky. One argument many analysts have been making for getting back into the market is to avoid the rush when interest rates are cut. If there is a stampede back into the market, a lot of the potential gains could be gone in a hurry. But how do you tell if and when that is going to happen?
The latest disappointment for forecasters came last week. The Bank of Japan's quarterly survey of companies, known as the Tankan, showed the economy slowing and business confidence declining. But the news was not bad enough. The report showed some capital investment strength, instead of the weakness that would presage a sharp decline in the economy.
Altogether, the report did not signal that a fast slowdown in the economy is around the corner -- the kind of economic slump that would trigger a cut in interest rates to cushion the fall.
And Yasushi Mieno, the canny head of the Bank of Japan, seemed once again to be purposefully vague about what it will take to satisfy him that inflation is low enough. Consumer inflation is at 3 percent and falling. Real estate prices, which are especially important to Mr. Mieno, are also declining. But, he indicated last week, he is now worried about the tightness in labor markets and the level of capacity utilization.
To add to the confusion, the rally in the dollar last week against the yen and other currencies makes any move to lower interest rates in Japan more difficult. Such a cut in rates would weaken the yen, swelling the huge Japanese import bill and adding inflationary pressure to the economy.
"Everyone has lost a good yardstick at this moment," said Yuichi Kohashi, executive vice president of Daiwa Securities America Inc., bemoaning the difficulty of divining what is likely to happen next. Daiwa had forecast an interest rate cut by the end of June and probably earlier.
Salomon Brothers is another of the many firms confounded by the Bank of Japan and the economic data. Salomon had predicted an interest rate cut in the first quarter, then shifted its predicted date to the third quarter, when Mr. Mieno in April signaled he was unlikely to act soon.
Last week's developments are "ammunition for the authorities to delay the official discount rate cut to late in the third quarter or even later," said Kermit L. Schoenholtz, a Salomon analyst in Tokyo.
For a stock-market rally to materialize, cuts in interest rates are almost certainly needed. The market, which analysts say is overvalued now, will not be moved much by other forces. While the Tankan data was not as downbeat as had been predicted, forecasters still expect the Japanese economy to slow sharply from the 5.6 percent growth, after adjustment for inflation, in the gross national product last year.
Some economists expect the G.N.P. figures to be released soon will show a torrid growth rate of 10 percent to 14 percent for the first three months of 1991. But then the slowdown will begin, they say, with the economy flat in the second quarter and declining in the second half of the year.
For the whole year, Salomon is below the consensus, with a prediction of around 2.5 percent. Daiwa, for now, is closer to the consensus, around 3.5 percent to 4 percent.
In addition, total corporate earnings look miserable. Salomon is expecting a small decline overall for the current fiscal year, which ends next March 31.
With Mr. Mieno playing hard to figure out and the rising dollar and weakening yen giving the Bank of Japan less maneuverability, timing the turnaround will be as frustrating as ever. Last week, lamented Mr. Kohashi, "there was no solution, just postponement."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
For This Quiz, The Answer Is More Confusion

BYLINE: By Diana B. Henriques

 BODY:
Take out your pencils for a multiple-choice test. The best and brightest forecasters at Wall Street's leading blue-chip firms think that:
a. The recession is over, the recovery will be tame and inflation will be low. 
 b. The recession is over, the rebound will be robust and inflation is a danger.
c. The recession is not over, and the timing and strength of the recovery are uncertain.
d. All of the above.
The correct answer, unfortunately, is "All of the above." And that may provide some explanation for the bond market's uneasy behavior and the uncertain signals it has been sending to the stock market, which jerked and jittered through the week and finally closed at 3,000.45, up 23.72 points for the week.
Indeed, the soothsaying disagreement is such that some analysts think investors are being charged a "confusion tax" -- a penalty that simply reflects the market's inability to figure out who's right. "It would be hard to quantify how much of the long Treasury bond yield is caused by uncertainty," said Josh Stiles, a bond analyst for I.D.E.A., a British research firm. "But it is very real."
Gilbert Benz, an economist with the Swiss Bank Corporation in New York, thinks the correct answer to the quiz is "b." But he agrees that traders may just be driven by indecision, "especially in a week like this."
That is, a week in which the Government reported Thursday that May wholesale prices were up an unexpectedly high 0.6 percent and that May retail sales were strong. That supported the "robust recovery" case. On Friday, the Government reported that May consumer prices rose a benign 0.3 percent, confounding the alarmists. The latter figure helped "confirm our low-inflation recovery forecast," reported Ed Yardeni, the chief economist for C. J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell, who votes for "a" in the quiz.
But Mr. Stiles points out that 65 percent of the professional traders polled by his firm on Friday think "c" is the right answer, and that the recession is not yet over. Moreover, many are fearful that the Federal Reserve will misread the economic evidence and move soon to tighten credit in response to unfounded inflation fears.
And Lawrence Kudlow, the chief economist for Bear, Stearns & Company, doesn't even agree that there is any disagreement. "Curiously, I see a very broad agreement," he said. "In the last 10 days, the consensus has shifted to expect a strong recovery. I just think they're wrong. My view is we're getting a recovery, but it will be substandard."
Mr. Benz brings the debate full circle by pointing out that professional forecasters "usually underestimate the economy's strength in the early stages of a rebound." Which is perilously close to that schoolroom baffler in which someone says, "Everything I say is a lie" and students have to wrestle with the logical consequences. One big difference: Billions in trading profits aren't riding on whether the students come up with the right answer.

HEADLINE: Sticky Problems in Bringing Films to Soviet Screens

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
In 1989, Ismail Merchant and James Ivory, the New York film producer and director whose company's credits include "A Room with a View" and "Mr. and Mrs. Bridge," made a deal to sell their films in the Soviet Union. Merchant Ivory Productions planned to license three movies to Paritet, a Moscow-based company. The deal was in rubles, which Merchant planned to use to make a film in the Soviet Union.
But Merchant Ivory's foray into the new market ended badly. Paritet sued Merchant for $26 million for the profits it said it lost because the first film, "Deceivers," was delivered late and incomplete and subsequent films were not delivered at all.
On May 19, the American Arbitration Association fined Merchant Ivory Productions 2.3 million rubles. Though it is neither in dollars, as Paritet had sought, nor anywhere near the 15 million rubles that Paritet used to arrive at $26 million, the fine is substantial. 
 In fact, depending on the rate the parties use to convert rubles to dollars, Merchant Ivory may end up paying a fine that far exceeds the top amount -- of several hundred thousand dollars -- that any American film company has earned distributing a film in Russia.
The Arbitration Association gave no explanation for its decision. But the case sheds light on the differences in moviegoing customs in the two countries and the potential for difficulties that film companies may have in a country that is struggling to transform itself into a market economy.
Historically, few United States companies have distributed their films in the Soviet Union. Indeed, in an action last week unrelated to the Merchant Ivory case, the Motion Picture Association of America, which represents this country's major film companies, announced that it would cease licensing films there or sending films to the Moscow Film Festival. The move was in protest of the absence of any Soviet law against film piracy, a chronic problem for American studios doing business in that country.
Another problem in doing business in the Soviet Union is that the banking system is new, hard currency is scarce and the ruble is volatile, with various rates of exchange for various transactions. Despite the arbitration association's decision, Paritet and Merchant Ivory may face a battle over the valuation of the ruble settlement. Charles Sutherland, whose consulting firm, Washington Film Associates, represented Paritet, claims that, using the new commercial rate of exchange to buy rubles, the figure is equivalent to $1.3 million. Mr. Sutherland maintains that rate is appropriate because the decision said that rubles must be obtained "by any legal means available."
 In a telephone interview, Mr. Merchant said his company is exploring several options for paying the damages. But he said he hoped to buy the rubles at a rate better than the commercial exchange, and thus pay no more than about $71,000. William Horner, of Horner & Isaacs, the law firm that represented Merchant Ivory, said the company could, for instance, buy rubles on the floor of the State Bank Currency Exchange or work out an arrangement with another company that might swap rubles for rights to some of Merchant Ivory's films. Mr. Sutherland maintains that "except for an auction, there is no legal method for buying rubles." But time is pressing; the settlement must be paid by June 19.
The squabbles between Paritet and Merchant Ivory started soon after their agreement was signed. Paritet claimed that Merchant Ivory was very late in delivering the prints of "Deceivers," that it sent the wrong kind of sound track and that one print was damaged. Merchant Ivory argued that it was not notified that one type of print, the internegative, was faulty until seven weeks after the shipment. "We would have sent new reels for damaged reels," Mr. Merchant said.
The dispute over the sound track is more peculiar. The wide variety of dialects in the Soviet Union makes it impossible to produce a single dubbed film. Mr. Sutherland argued that it is routine in international film agreements to get a special magnetic sound track rather than the optical sound track that Merchant Ivory sent. Paritet would have used the magnetic sound track to make separate audiocassettes for each region.
But Merchant Ivory argued that the contract did not require any sound track at all. It sent one, it said, as a courtesy. Merchant Ivory contends that Paritet had told it that, instead of providing dubbed films to each theater, it planned to use individuals who would simultaneously translate the film orally at the movie theatre. "If there had been dubbing, we would have had to approve the translation in any case," said Mr. Horner.
Even more central to the argument, Paritet complained that "Deceivers" arrived so late that it could not release it in the winter when movie attendance is highest. As a result, it said, it lost potential profits from three to five million tickets. It forecast additional lost revenues from the two films that did not arrive based on its projections of ticket sales of 8 million to 10 million apiece.
Attendance numbers in the Soviet Union have always been difficult for American companies to verify, according to the M.P.A.A.'s president, Jack Valenti. And Mr. Merchant said that Paritet's claim was unrealistic because the films were only modest hits in the United States and were unlikely to generate as much business in the Soviet Union. "Quartet," one of the films Paritet requested, sold about 400,000 tickets at the box office here, Mr. Merchant said.
But Mr. Sutherland countered that his client based the numbers on its previous experiences in distributing American films and that his figures are checked by Goskino, the Soviet film agency.
Many American companies have been reluctant to license films to the Soviets because the arrangements pay poorly. While United States companies typically receive a flat fee plus a percentage of box-office profits in major foreign markets, they seldom earn more than a flat fee in the Soviet Union, usually in the $150,000 range for a movie that might sell as many as 35 million tickets. As a result, the Motion Picture Association of America reported 1990 revenues of only $750,000 from the Soviet Union.
The association's decision on Tuesday to stop licensing films to the Soviet Union follows previous attempts to find a more viable way of doing business in the Soviet Union. Two years ago, in an effort to improve revenues, the M.P.A.A.'s Mr. Valenti struck an agreement with Goskino. The agreement would have allowed American companies to earn both a flat fee and a percentage of profits from ticket sales. The agreement was in rubles rather than dollars, but was still an improvement over prior terms, Mr. Valenti said.
However after the agreement was signed, Mr. Valenti recalled, a group of high-level Soviets came to the United States. "They had never heard about the deal," he said. 'They said they did not know anything about it."
Since then, some efforts have been made to strike deals, not just by small companies like Merchant Ivory but by the major studios as well. One step forward was taken last year when Michael Macclesfield, vice president for international sales of United International Pictures, signed an agreement to distribute MGM's "Gone With the Wind," for a hard-currency guarantee in dollars and a percentage of profits in rubles. Mr. Macclesfield said 8.5 million tickets have been sold, but was not specific about how much money the company had actually earned from the deal.
But that arrangement remains the exception. William Mechanic, head of the Walt Disney Company's international distribution business, reflected the caution of others: "The Russians have one of the highest attendances in the world, but I don't think anyone has any idea what the business is worth," he said. "Disney has not licensed to the Russians for the past three years."
Eventually companies will take more steps forward, but the progress is bound to be very slow.

COMPANIES
 
Can Apple and I.B.M. Find Common Ground?
 

For more than a month rumors were circulating in the wilds of Silicon Valley and in button-downed Armonk, N.Y., that Apple Computer Inc., and its arch rival, the International Business Machines Corporation, might talk about working together. The rumors said John Sculley, Apple's chairman, had the idea and broached it with I.B.M. Last week the rumors proved true. The companies sat toe-to-toe at I.B.M.'s headquarters in Armonk. Though details are still scant, it seems the meetings were about collaborating on work stations, powerful computers one step up from PC's. I.B.M. has a fast new chip, the RS/6000, it would like Apple to use. Apple is working on new software. Sounds like a nice fit. One possibility is that the companies might form a joint venture, with I.B.M. helping to defray Apple's development costs. If do they strike a deal, it would be a big blow to Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems and the other work station makers.
 
The Banks Win One
 
Want to add a little dazzle to that drab bank lobby? Put in an insurance desk. That was not possible until last week when the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit decided state-chartered banks could sell insurance if state law permitted it. The ruling came in response to a move by Citicorp to overturn a Federal Reserve Board decision last year ordering it to stop selling and underwriting insurance through the Family Guardian Life Insurance Company, one of Citicorp's Delaware subsidiaries. The ruling -- which will bring smiles and profits (it hopes) to Citicorp and the nation's other big banks that are looking for new businesses -- is likely to make the Fed and the insurance industry wince. For the Fed, the ruling questions its regulatory authority. For the insurance industry, the ruling means a powerful new rival.
 
Adland in an Uproar
 
It was not the advertising industry's finest hour. Last week at the Clio Awards dinner in New York, the industry's equivalent of the Academy Awards, 300 irate guests seated at tables simply walked on stage, took the awards and then walked out. They were furious because the banquet organizers did not show up. "If I hadn't been up for two Clios, I might have found it amusing," said Robert Waldner of J. Walter Thompson in New York. "I took home one award, but so did one out of every two people there." In the end, to help prevent a melee, waiters and waitresses handed out awards just like hors d'oeuvres. Another dinner is scheduled for next week.
 
Pickens's Miscalculation
 
Back in the 1988, T. Boone Pickens figured natural gas prices could only go higher. So the Mesa Limited Partnership, which he heads, borrowed $700 million and bought more reserves. Trouble was, gas prices never did rise. They stuck at about $1.25 per 1,000 cubic feet and Mesa was saddled with a total of $1.2 billion in debt. Last week, Mesa borrowed $616 million in long-term debt from a number of insurance companies and large institutions to pay off some short-term obligations. To get the money, Mr. Pickens had to pledge more than half of Mesa's natural gas reserves -- 1.2 trillion cubic feet. With the new loans, Mesa will be able to stretch out payments for up to 21 years. But trouble remains. According to Mr. Pickens, gas prices have to reach $2 per 1,000 cubic feet before the company can make a profit. They won't do that before 1993, he concedes. If prices don't recover, the gas could be auctioned off to pay back Mesa's creditors.
 
Cable Keeps Climbing
 
The price of basic cable television service keeps rising. Regulations by the Federal Communications Commission were supposed to prevent that. Last week, the F.C.C. adopted rules to give local governments more power to push back prices. But the rules contain a lot of loopholes: They only allow local governments to regulate "basic," service, loosely defined as the retransmission of broadcast channels. Because of this, cable operators have already begun moving some programs from basic service onto their premium, extra-cost channels. And because of the way the rules are written, most big cities will be exempt from local control. Consumer groups are dubious over whether the rules will bring down costs.
 
Lifting Auto Sales Gloom
 
The General Motors Corporation may have slimmed down, but it still has a lot of market muscle. Its sales increased by 17.8 percent in early June, compared to the 1990 period. That was enough to offset a 1 percent loss by the Ford Motor Company and pull the entire domestic industry up by 9.4 percent. "These numbers give greater confidence that sales may have bottomed," said Harvey Heinbach, of Merrill Lynch & Company in New York.
 
 In Brief
 
Like a lot of companies these days, the Unisys Corporation has too much debt -- $3.43 billion worth. So it agreed to sell its Timeplex Inc. computer networking subsidiary for $207 million to Ascom Holding of Switzerland.

 
 
THE ECONOMY

 
Inflation's Staying Power
 
Three years of sluggish monetary growth, lackluster gains in the gross national product and a recession should have had inflation licked. If only that were so. According to the Labor Department, the Producer Price Index, which measures wholesale inflation, was up 0.6 percent in May, the largest gain in seven months. Granted, most of the increases in the producer index came from higher energy prices -- they have since come down -- and a onetime increase in tobacco prices. But the underlying inflation rate has not come down. "I'm disappointed," said Mickey D. Levy, chief economist at CRT Government Securities in New York. "This is exactly the situation the Federal Reserve does not want to be in -- the beginning of a rebound with no improvement in inflation." A high inflation rate inhibits improvements in the housing market and "causes interest rates to go up," he said. These numbers are giving the bond markets the jitters.
 
A Slight S.& L. Upswing
 
No one doubts that the savings and loan industry is ailing. It has been plagued by massive failures that could cost taxpayers as much as $500 billion over the next 40 years. The institutions seized by the Government lost $726 million in the first quarter. But a part of the industry -- the thrifts that survived on their own -- showed surprisingly strength. They had profits of $626.8 million in the first quarter, according to the Office of Thrift Supervision -- the first profits in four years. Analysts said the profits came from the growing spread between what institutions pay depositors and what they charge for loans. Good for the institutions, tougher on the borrowers.

Consumers Back and in Demand
 
Finally, the consumer is starting to spend. According to the Commerce Department, retail sales were up a by 1.0 percent in May, a sizable jump for the month. And demand picked up for a broad range of goods. "We are definitely in a recovery," said Rosanne M. Cahn, an economist at First Boston Corporation.
 
A Fleeting Trade Surplus
 
For the first time since 1982, the United States posted a trade surplus. But don't uncork the (domestic) champagne just yet. Though the surplus was large -- $10.2 billion in the first quarter, according to the Commerce Department -- it was largely because of a one-time transfer of $22.7 billion from countries that helped pay for the Gulf War. It was also because of a recession-related slip in demand for imports. "Without those payments, the current account defict would still be about $70 billion this year. With the Gulf contributions, it will come down to about $20 billion," said William R. Cline, senior fellow at the Institute of International Economics in Washington. But more foreign payments are coming. Kuwait and Saudi Arabia pledged to help pay for New York's ticker tape parade.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL


That Winning Yeltsin Touch
 
Last week, Boris N. Yeltsin was elected president of Russia -- and this time he had opponents. Mr. Yeltsin, who renounced Communism a year ago, ran on an economic reform ticket with a long list of objectives. "The first priority is a new tax system. The second is privatization. The third is monetary reform," said Judy Shelton, senior research associate at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. But one objective could put Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev out of business: ending the Russian contributions which pay the Soviet central government's bills.

Bright Side to Business in Japan
 
Japan is a tough place to do business. But not as tough as some think. A survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan and A. T. Kearney, a management consulting firm, concluded that American companies doing business in Japan are often more profitable than their parents. Maybe so. But exporting to Japan remains tricky. This year Japan is expected to have a record worldwide trade surplus -- more than $70 billion.
 
Unified, Germany's in Deficit
 
Chalk it up to unification. West Germany, the world's largest exporter, had gone a decade without a trade deficit. But unified Germany reported a $790 million deficit for April, mainly a result of a 17 percent eastern German import surge. Economists think it will finish the year just breaking even, which, presumably, will make the United States look good. "Anything that takes away another country's trade surplus is good for American exports," said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics in New York.

Radisson Proposes Twin Hulls for the Queasy

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
Radisson Hotels International, the Minneapolis-based hotel chain, has decided to get into the $4.6 billion cruise business, and it is doing so in dramatic style. It has commissioned a 410-foot catamaran-like ship whose novel design is expected to reduce seasickness.
Diamond Cruise Ltd., a joint venture that includes Japanese, Finnish and American investors, began building the vessel, the world's largest twin-hull ship, in January in Finland. The ship will be managed by Radisson, a unit of the Carlson Companies, one of the largest private companies in the United States. 
 If the catamaran design indeed provides stability and minimizes seasickness, Radisson could tap into a market of people who have avoided cruises for fear of having an expensive vacation ruined by queasiness.
The twin-hull catamaran design has been around for centuries and is popular for sailboats. But commercial shipbuilders have been wary of the high expense of building a second hull and the technical uncertainties associated with building such a craft on a large scale. The longest existing catamaran is less than half the length of the proposed Radisson vessel.
There are currently only 17 commercial twin-hull vessels in operation, ferrying passengers on the rough seas off Japan and Hawaii and conducting oceanic research.
The new ship, the Radisson Diamond, is designed to carry up to 354 passengers. It is scheduled to be completed in May 1992 for about $125 million, 10 to 15 percent higher than the cost of a comparable single-hull ship. The plan is to charge $600 a day per person, putting Radisson in the top end of the cruise industry.
With the hotel business overbuilt, Radisson is attracted by the double-digit growth that the cruise industry enjoyed in the 1980's, when capacity surged at the same time the economy was prospering. The supply of new ships will continue to increase dramatically in the next few years, however, and there is some question whether demand will to keep pace.
Stability on choppy seas is the chief advantage of the Swath (small water-plane area twin-hull) design. The twin hulls allow shipbuilders to construct a much wider vessel, but one that has less contact with the water than a traditional ship.
"It allows so much less contact with the sea than a mono-hull vessel," said Robin Lindsey, vice president of cruise operations for the Radisson Diamond. "The smaller the water plane areas, the less effect the movement of the sea actually has on the movement of the vessel." The total water-plane area on the Radisson Diamond is less than half that of a single-hull vessel with the same passenger capacity.
The design cuts down on rolling, pitching and heaving, the movements of a vessel that cause seasickness.
"Stability was the starting point for this vessel," Mr. Lindsey said. He cited surveys that show fear of seasickness as one of the most common reasons given for not taking a cruise. Only about 5 percent of the United States population has ever gone on such a voyage.
But some industry professionals are skeptical that Radisson will be able to make an effective sales pitch by targeting vacationers with weak stomachs.
"I am not sure how you can go out and say, 'Take a cruise on our ship, and you will not get seasick,' " said Oivind Mathisen, editor of Cruise Industry News, a newsletter for cruise-industry executives.
W. Bruce Turner, an analyst with Raymond James & Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla., said, "If indeed there is a noticeable and discernible difference, maybe they can market that as a slight value-added dimension."
Radisson executives acknowledge the delicacy of the weak-stomach promotion. "I didn't find a very positive way to put a twist on it," said John Norlander, president of the Radisson Hotel Corporation, a sister company of Radisson International. As a result, the company will focus on the novel design and the luxury and spaciousness of the ship's appointments.
With a breadth of 105 feet, the vessel is as wide as traditional ships that are twice its 410-foot length. In addition to providing stability, this allows for large dining rooms, staterooms and common areas. "It gives you a totally different space configuration," said Mr. Mathisen. "In a sense, it is less like a traditional ship and more like a floating resort."
Because of the extensive space the Swath design provides, the industry has been toying with the new technology for a number of years. "Shipyards over the past 10 years have frequently presented their drawings for the ship of the future, and they have often had this twin-hull design," said Mr. Mathisen. Still, he said, mainly because of the high cost of building a new ship, executives have been slow to place orders.
In the ship industry, there is a fear of being the first one to try something, in case it does not work. Shipping experts say just because something works in a model tank does not mean it will work on the open seas.
Aside from the higher costs of building the Diamond, which stem primarily from the additional steel needed to construct the second hull, there are several other drawbacks to the design.
The Diamond is slow compared with other ocean liners, cruising at just over 12 knots, compared with the usual 17 or 18 knots. The ship has an engine in each hull. But the size of each hull is a constraint on the size of the engines, and the speed generated by the two smaller engines does not match that of a conventional ship with a single large engine. The slowness in turn restricts the ship's possible destinations. For instance, it would be impractical to schedule a round-the-world cruise on the Diamond. The ship will be based in Puerto Rico to allow quick access to the Caribbean islands, where it will do most of its cruising. Most cruise ships are based in Miami.
Another problem is that each hull has a deep draft, about 25 feet, making it impossible to dock in some ports. A single-hull 400-foot ship might draw as little as 15 feet. To compensate, the Radisson ship will have several water taxis to take passengers ashore at such harbors.
Intriguing new technology or not, Radisson will face stiff competition in the cruise industry, as a host of ships on which construction began three years ago start coming to market. "It could be a very difficult time, especially for a new operator entering the market," said Mr. Turner of Raymond James & Associates.

HEADLINE: All About/Car Recycling;
An Afterlife for Automobiles

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY

 BODY:
The entire building shakes and shudders as a 6,000-horsepower electric motor drives a rotary shredder that reduces whole automobiles to fist-sized recyclable pieces of metal scrap in about 30 seconds. The pieces fall onto a moving conveyor that passes under a magnetized drum, which lifts off the steel and iron. The drum leaves other metals, plastic and miscellaneous materials for hand sorting. The iron and steel chunks are stored in huge piles nearby until they are shipped to steel mills around the world to be made into new products.
This is recycling that works. As governments and industries struggle to establish recycling programs for newspapers, plastics and other household trash, the Prolerized Schiabo Neu Company, a privately held recycling company here, turned 300,000 old cars into high-grade iron ore last year. With scrap at about $90 a long ton, a typical car fetches about $100. For the shredder, costs vary widely depending upon location, the age of the equipment in use and the costs of disposing of what cannot be recycled. 
 According to the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries, a trade group in Washington, shredders like this processed nine million old automobiles last year and enough appliances, industrial materials and construction debris to provide steel makers with 58 million tons of scrap -- 43 percent of all the steel produced domestically. They also contributed 61 percent of all lead produced, mostly from old batteries. There are about 220 shredders in the United States.
Structural steel, which is bigger and thicker than the steel used in automobiles, must be flame cut by hand before it can be recycled in the nation's steel minimills.

 
 
The Shredders
A Way to Separate The Useful Metals
 Auto recycling has evolved over the decades. Starting in the 1930's, cars were often burned in the open to get rid of seats and other combustible materials. Concerns about air pollution put an end to open burning by the 1960's, so the cars were simply compressed into cubes and sent to steel mills.
As long as they were going into open hearth furnaces along with iron ore and limestone in the basic steel forming process, these "dirty bales" were acceptable, said Mr. Jay A. Zimmern, general manager of Prolerized Schiabo. But the rise of the minimill industry (so called because it does not have ore processing equipment present in fully integrated mills) in the 1970's, increased the quality requirements for scrap.
"You shred to get rid of impurities," Mr. Zimmern said. The impact of the shredder even cracks the paint off the outer panels of cars. Because only ferrous metals are attracted to the magnet, the resulting material is almost entirely iron and steel.
Shredding also permits efficient packing of the electric arc furnaces that are the heart of minimills. Material in small chunks fills the furnace more completely than large bales.
Prolerized Schiabo shreds more than cars, although they are the biggest single input. It also buys and chops up steel doors, desks, hot-water heaters and shelving. It will not take appliances with motors because some contain polychlorinated biphenyls that could render the company's entire inventory as hazardous waste under Environmental Protection Agency rules.
It also takes structural steel from old buildings and other structures, and flame cuts it into lengths that will fit in an electric furnace. "The West Side Highway came through here," Mr. Zimmern said.
Metals other than iron and steel are sorted by hand from a conveyor belt in a nearby building. An experienced eye can tell die-cast zinc from aluminum or stainless steel. Everything, even the mixed materials that are left after the identifiable materials are pulled out, is eventually sold.
 
The Minimills
Turning Scrap Back Into Steel
 The steel minimill industry, an increasingly important part of the worldwide steel business, relies entirely on recycled scrap for its raw material. The highly efficient minimills produce many grades of steel at less cost than mills that start with virgin ore. In the United States, minimills account for about 20 percent of total steel output.
"We solve a problem for society," Mr. Zimmern said of the shredders and minimills. Recycling cars and appliances removes unsightly waste that otherwise would take up scarce landfill space. Mr. Zimmern estimates the amount of scrap processed here last year would have used six million cubic yards in a landfill, compared with the 175,000 cubic yards of valueless material actually dumped.
Recycling iron and steel is environmentally beneficial because it reduces the amount of iron ore that has to be gouged from the earth's crust. And since it takes 74 percent less energy to make steel from scrap than it does from virgin ore, it means less air pollution from burning fuel.
Most of the scrap processed at this waterside facility is exported to Japan and Korea. So it is possible that an old Chevrolet or Buick going into Prolerized Schiabo's shredder would come back in a few months as part of a shiny new Toyota or Hyundai. Nationwide, 19 million tons of steel scrap were exported in 1989, the latest year for which figures are available.

 
 
The Dismantlers
Stripping Cars For Spare Parts
 Automobiles are recycled in stages. The first stop is usually at a dismantler, like Riverside Auto Parts in Avanel, N.J. Each car that comes in is evaluated, and useful parts are removed.
Since dismantlers are the source for used parts for amateur and professional mechanics, they have a good feel for what is in demand. "On some cars, we remove the glass and store it," said Robert Terefenko, the manager at Riverside Auto Parts. "We know it will sell." On other models, the glass is ignored and other parts removed.
Dismantlers have a good eye for value, said Michael A. Cerreta, an executive of the Schiavone-Bonomo Corporation, a scrap-metal dealer here and one of the owners of Prolerized Schiabo. "I may pay $50 or $60 for a car strictly on a weight basis," he said. "But Riverside may pay $200 because they know the hood could be worth as much as $700 as a crash part."
The dismantler is responsible for removing things like lead-acid batteries, which could be hazardous to workers if the acid leaked, and gas tanks, which can explode.
When all the useful or potentially contaminating materials have been removed, the auto hulk is put in a press and flattened. This is largely for transportation efficiency. A truck that could haul six full-size autos can take 18 when they are compressed.
But business is off somewhat these days, thanks to the national economic recession. "Scrap over all is down about 30 percent," Mr. Zimmern said. With fewer new-car sold, fewer cars are junked. But even with a slowdown, Prolerized Schiabo buys 1,000 cars a day to meet the need for recycled steel.
 
 
 
THAT'S A 385-POUND, 3-WEEK HAMMER
 
 
The heart of a large automobile shredder is a 50-ton rotor with 20 blades or hammers made of hard manganese steel. Large grapplers lift car hulks off flat-bed truck trailers and place them on a conveyor that carries them to the entrance of the 50-foot-high machine.
The car drops in the machine and the hammers smash and tear at the metal until the pieces are small enough to fall through holes in the bottom that measure 5 inches by 10 inches. According to the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries, small shredders start at about $1 million and a large one can cost well over $5 million. And because of the violence of the action inside the shredder, even the hardened steel hammers have a relatively short life.
Brand new, each 385-pound hammer looks like a bow tie, with holes in the middle where it can be mounted to the rotor. Each corner of the bow tie represents a working face of the hammer. As one face is worn down, it is turned to expose a new face. By the time a hammer's useful life is over, it resembles a figure eight, with all the corners worn round.
Officials of Prolerized Schiabo said the average useful life of a hammer is about three weeks. What is left is recycled to companies specializing in manganese steel.

PRIVATIZATION

BYLINE: By Richard M. Daley ;Richard M. Daley is Mayor of Chicago.

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
In whatever shape New York City survives this financial crisis, another siege is only a matter of time if there are no fundamental changes in how the city gets and spends its money. Most such structural reforms have been considered politically unthinkable -- until now. The Op-Ed page asked several specialists for ways that fiscal necessity could be the mother of municipal invention.
 We've introduced privatization in city government, and the innovation hasn't been nearly as distasteful as many predicted. In this union town, there were plenty of skeptics. But privatization has worked -- with bumps. 
 For example, city towing crews could not keep up with the abandoned cars, trucks and even buses that littered the streets. Since 1989, abandoned vehicles have been towed by neighborhood companies that quickly respond to complaints while paying $25 a vehicle, which is sold for scrap metal. A service that cost Chicago millions has netted more than $1.2 million over the last year. City crews now spend all their time on illegal parking downtown.
City street-paving crews were inspired to improve their performance beginning in 1990 when we hired private contractors to pave the wards adjacent to where they worked. Both sets of crews competed to see who could do the job faster and better.
But we learned that not all privatization would go smoothly when we privatized drug treatment and contracted janitorial services for several facilities. Instead of spending $1.5 million to rehabilitate our aging drug treatment center, in 1990 we contracted with two private nonprofit organizations that have run innovative substance-abuse programs for years. This allowed us to reassign center staff members to city health clinics at nights and on weekends. City employees, who had become accustomed to working 8 A.M. to 4:30 P.M., Monday through Friday, were outraged that their schedules were adjusted to serve the public better. Never mind that no jobs were lost and that we now serve 200 more clients a year at three centers instead of one, while saving $737,000 annually.
Organized labor cooperates fully. In 1990, when Chicago contracted for janitorial services at some facilities, unionized companies agreed to hire, at the same wages, all the low-seniority janitors who were released after other city jobs were found for the high-seniority janitors. In the first year, the city saved $900,000 on cleaning supplies. The union saved jobs for its members. But not all the workers were happy. Besides the working hours, which inconvenience the public, they like the city's generous benefits.
City government should stick to basic services it provides very well and buy others. It matters little to the tax-paying public, which expects good service, who renders it.

Small Change

BYLINE: By Anthony E. Shorris and Mark Elliott; Anthony E. Shorris was city Finance Commissioner. Mark Elliott was Deputy Budget Director.

 BODY:
In whatever shape New York City survives this financial crisis, another siege is only a matter of time if there are no fundamental changes in how the city gets and spends its money. Most such structural reforms have been considered politically unthinkable -- until now. The Op-Ed page asked several specialists for ways that fiscal necessity could be the mother of municipal invention.
Budgets aren't balanced with one or two good, big ideas, and even modest savings don't come easily. Still, small change can add up. For example, every Fire Department battalion chief doesn't need a driver; they cost $14 million a year. Most firemen spend less than 2 percent of their time fighting fires; imagine how many housing code inspections they could make. 
 Pretrial detainees wait, on average, 47 days in jail for their day in court. It was 41 days just 18 months ago. Returning to the old level would save $80 million annually that could be used to preserve drug programs for inmates.
Many sanitation workers spend fewer than three hours a day picking up garbage but are paid for eight. Changing that might save the recycling program, especially if one-man trucks were used.
The city fills out its paperwork correctly 90 percent of the time in the child welfare program, yet still faces the loss of up to $30 million in state sanctions for mistakes. Simplifying the standards would save enough money to preserve drug treatment programs for families.
The time isn't right for spending $40 million to implement the new charter. The purported improvements in democracy are not worth it.
Pharmacies' lobbyists have prevented the city from making bulk purchases of drugs and equipment. The savings from such purchases could save periled outpatient clinics.
How about cash incentives for city workers who collect child support payments from fathers who run out on their children? A 10 percent increase in collections would generate $7 million to use for programs for the homeless.
Are there dozens more ideas like these, perhaps better? Sure.

Albany on Holiday
After failing to pass a state budget until the ninth week of the new fiscal year -- costing local governments tens of millions of dollars in interest payments -- the New York State Senate acted swiftly last week to award its 1,600 staff members an extra paid holiday, at a cost of $175,000 to taxpayers, according to the State Comptroller's Office. 
 As a reward for arduous work during the protracted budget wrangling -- which produced a budget that cut spending but was still not balanced, said Gov. Mario M. Cuomo -- the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, ordered Senate offices closed last Monday and gave the staff a paid day off. The day was declared an official Senate holiday to commemorate the Persian Gulf war.
In another example of the confusion that beclouded the State Capitol during most of the budget fight, the Senate was under the mistaken impression that the Assembly had gone along with the gesture. But Assembly staff members who took the day off used up a vacation day or compensatory time.
Although the Comptroller put the cost of an extra holiday at $175,000, John McCardle, a spokesman for Mr. Marino, said the holiday might have saved money by closing offices, thus cutting down on the use of lights, telephones and equipment.
 
 Cutting vs. Saving

As a candidate for mayor of New York, David N. Dinkins portrayed himself as a responsible liberal, committed to the proposition that spending more for services for the poor would not only help people, but would save money too.
In a sort of trickle-up economic theory, he argued that expanding health programs, drug treatment and other preventive services could cut the city's budget by keeping more poor people out of hospitals, jails and foster care.
"It costs approximately $2,000 to keep a family together," he said during the campaign. "If it busts up and the kids are placed in foster care, it costs $10,000 to $12,000 per child. Aside from the human considerations, which are obvious, it costs less."
Now, after months of fiscal worries and budget-cutting, a coalition of the city's largest private social-service agencies is making exactly the same point as they lobby against cuts ordered by Mr. Dinkins in some of the same programs he championed during the campaign.
In a report released at a City Hall news conference last week, the coalition, the Human Services Council of New York, argued that, for example, a proposed $4.7 million cut in a program to help drug-addicted mothers could soon cost the city $8.9 million a year by forcing more children into foster care.
During the campaign, Mr. Dinkins also argued that by spending more, the city would bring in millions of dollars in matching state and Federal funds. The social-service agencies say that by cutting the drug program, Mr. Dinkins will be giving up $14.3 million in state and Federal aid.
"I think that both candidate Dinkins and Mayor Dinkins would acknowledge that now all of the figures show these cuts will have a dramatic impact on the city," said Megan McLaughlin, executive director of the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies and co-chairwoman of the coalition. "By cutting back services, it costs you more in the long run."
The Mayor's acting press secretary, Leland T. Jones, said that when the budget ax fell, Mr. Dinkins was forced to maintain spending on programs mandated by law, at the expense of others.
"We are very sympathetic to the Mayor's original intention when he took office," Mr. Jones said. "We are concerned that the gap between what he wanted to do and will be able to do is alarmingly wide."
 
 In the Pre-Turnpike Era

In its never-ending search for an identity beyond that of a rest stop between New York City and Philadelphia, the State of New Jersey has found a new symbol -- the 70-million-year-old Hadrosaurus foulkii, which is now the official state dinosaur.
At a bill-signing ceremony at the State House in Trenton on Thursday, Gov. Jim Florio said the Hadrosaurus and New Jersey were, "historically speaking, perfect together."
The bill-signing culminated a three- year lobbying campaign by students at the Strawbridge Elementary School in Westmont, near where a nearly complete skeleton of the dinosaur was unearthed in 1858. The species is named after its discoverer, William Parke Foulke, a scientist from the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences.
While legislators dallied over the measure, the students were promoted from the third to sixth grade.
Alas, the designation of Hadrosaurus may do little to raise the esteem of New Jersey in the eyes of its neighbors. The dinosaur is now in residence in Pennsylvania, at the Academy of Natural Sciences.
 
 Are We There Yet?
 A few hundred bookworms were gathered in the park across the street from City Hall on Thursday, protesting budget cuts that could force the closing of libraries, when Mayor Dinkins decided to join them.
But instead of walking the 100 yards or so from City Hall to the site of the protest at the far end of the well-tended park, Mr. Dinkins climbed into the back seat of his shiny black Cadillac and was chauffeured to the demonstration.
If Governor Cuomo on occasion walks from his World Trade Center office to meetings in lower Manhattan, why did Mr. Dinkins drive across the street -- especially at a time of deep budget-cutting?
Mr. Jones, the Mayor's acting press secretary, attributed the decision to time constraints and security, not mayoral flat-footedness. He said that with the rally about to end, the Mayor's bodyguards decided it would take too much time for Mr. Dinkins to make his way through the crowd to get to the podium.
"Even if the crowd was friendly, they thought this would be the best way," Mr. Jones said. After speaking, Mr. Dinkins waded into the crowd.
 
 On the Front Lines

Everybody loved the parade. The bands blared, the soldiers marched, the confetti flickered in the sunlight, and the politicians made a frontal assault on the reviewing stand.
New York City's ticker-tape parade for the Persian Gulf veterans brought out the politician in all the local politicians -- whatever their position on the war -- as they vied for a spot in the front ranks of the reviewing stand, in view of television cameras.
Mayor Dinkins, who said he opposed the war but supported the troops, stood front and center throughout. Representative Steven J. Solarz of Brooklyn, one of the chief Congressional hawks, was assigned a seat in the fourth row of the viewing stand near City Hall. But as the bands marched on, he appeared standing in the front row at Mr. Dinkins's right hand.
Borough President Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan, who had preferred economic sanctions to military action against Iraq, somehow made her way to the front of the platform to be photographed with Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the commander of the operation. Her official seat was in the fifth row.

HEADLINE: Former Satellites of Moscow Fault Western Aid for Soviets

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, June 15

 BODY:
Eastern European officials have angrily criticized Western economic aid to the Soviet Union, saying it has hurt their beleaguered economies by causing Moscow to reduce purchases from the former Soviet bloc.
In speeches in the last week, Hungarian, Polish and Czechoslovak officials have called on the West to structure any future aid to Moscow so it boosts, rather than undercuts, their nations' exports to the Soviet Union. 
 Eastern European officials complain, for instance, about Western farm credits to the Soviet Union, which often require Moscow to buy agricultural goods from the donor countries. Credits like these make it hard for Hungary and Poland to sell their farm goods to the Soviet Union, and increases economic pressure on countries that are already reeling from the disintegration of the Comecon trading bloc.
"What they give with one hand they destroy with the other in Central Europe," Bela Kadar, the Hungarian Minister of International Economic Relations, said this week at a conference in Geneva.
 
$1.5 Billion Farm Aid by U.S.
 Although Eastern European officials interviewed did not criticize the United States in particular, they faulted aid programs like the $1.5 billion farm aid credit to Moscow that the Bush Administration announced on Tuesday. Moscow is to use that money to buy American farm goods.
Eastern European officials say their countries are far too small and their budgets too stretched for them to put together huge credit packages like those made by the United States, Germany, Italy and other countries.
"This type of aid is diverting trade away from Eastern Europe, and not just in agriculture" said Laszlo Lang, director of the Central European Research Center, based in Budapest.
In recent days, Eastern European officials have stepped up their campaign about aid to Moscow because they are eager for the West to rethink its aid policies before the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, meets with the leaders of Group of Seven industrial countries in London in July.
Western officials say they do not plan to grant extensive aid to Mr. Gorbachev in London because Moscow has not yet shown a firm commitment to a market economy, but Eastern European officials say it is only a matter of time before the West steps up aid.
 
Triangular Aid Is Urged
 At a conference this week in Bardejov, Czechoslovakia, Prime Minster Jan Krzysztof Bielecki of Poland and Foreign Minister Jiri Dientsbier of Czechoslovakia urged the West to pursue a policy of triangular aid, in which a Western donor nation might, for instance, use its aid to buy Eastern European goods that would then be sold or given to the Soviet Union.
Mr. Bielecki said, "If the western credits for the Soviet Union were earmarked for the purchase of needed goods from Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland, this would provide us with the means for restructuring our state enterprises, which in former times sent 80 percent of their production to our eastern neighbor."
Some Eastern European officials say that as a condition for granting aid to Moscow, the Group of Seven should require the Soviet Union to pay what it owes on goods recently purchased from the former Soviet bloc. They would also like the West to require Moscow to honor supply contracts it has with Eastern Europe, especially regarding oil.
"What we're saying is aid to the Soviet Union could also help Central Europe," said Michael Cermak, a spokesman for Czechoslovakia's Foreign Minister. "It's in the West's interest to have stable democracies here instead of countries with serious economc and social problems."

On Some Plots, Sheep May Not Safely Graze

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ORWELL, Vt., June 14

 BODY:
The problem was how to mow the steep, rocky hillsides of two cemeteries in this farming town next to Lake Champlain. Noel Smith, the town manager, was certain he had a solution that was perfect for the 1990's: environmentally safe and at the same time economical. The answer, he thought, was sheep.
That was why he was pleasantly surprised last winter, when Jean Beck, a local sheep farmer, was the low bidder on the job of mowing two of Orwell's four cemeteries. 
 Ms. Beck said she and her flock of 20 Dorset sheep could do for about $250 what would cost up to $3,000 with mechanized mowers. Most of her cost would be in transporting the sheep and setting up the electric fence to contain them.
"I thought it would be an excellent way to keep the cemeteries open at a cheap price," Ms. Beck said.
But having provided for care of the dead, Orwell's three selectmen soon discovered that they had not reckoned with the wrath of the living. "These people have some strong concerns, some very real concerns, that we considered but didn't anticipate would be so strong," Mr. Smith said.
Tyson Allen registered one of those concerns. At a meeting of the Board of Selectmen on Tuesday, he said he has 11 relatives buried in the two graveyards and is certain they would not like to be tended by sheep.
"My Aunt Mabel is in there," Mr. Allen said. "If she had wanted to be buried in a sheep pasture, I'm sure she would have conveyed that to us."
Cecelia Barnes felt the same way, and she is a sheep owner. "It's the most horrible thing I ever heard of," she said. "It's disrespectful."
The first public rumblings of anger were heard in May. As May turned to June and the grass began to grow in earnest, so did the tensions in town.
Outsiders jumped into the debate. An editorial writer for The Rutland Herald wrote: "Since sheep were Vermont's chief agricultural product a century and a half ago, it is quite likely that some of those buried in Orwell's cemeteries back then would feel comfortable at the presence of such familiar animals."
The editorial went on: "The earliest depictions of Jesus show him as beardless youth with a sheep slung over his shoulders. There is no record that anybody has protested this portrayal as a desecration."
Finally, the selectmen added the sheep question to the agenda of Tuesday's regular meeting to bring the matter into the open. Lynn Allen, wife of Tyson Allen, set the tone for the confrontation when she presented the board with a petition "strongly opposed to the use of sheep as lawnmowers." It was signed by 136 of Orwell's 1,000 residents.
When Ms. Beck tried to explain that her sheep would be pastured at any one cemetery only for a couple of weeks at a time, Mrs. Allen sharply reminded her what sheep do after they eat.
After a heated half-hour debate, two selectmen split on the issue. Ron Huntley, the board chairman, cast the deciding vote -- against the sheep -- but only after having his say.
"Personally, I am 100 percent in favor of having those sheep in those cemeteries," said Mr. Huntley before bringing his gavel down on the unruly meeting. "They have never looked better. The problem is that people are threatening to turn the sheep loose or to shoot them."
Then he turned to a group of residents who had volunteered to mow and trim the cemeteries for the rest of the season at no cost to the town.
"I'm going to vote to remove the sheep," he warned them, "on condition that the people who have volunteered to maintain the cemetery do what they say they're going to do. If I see that those cemeteries aren't being kept up, those sheep will be right back where they were."
With that, most of the crowd moved into the misty night on the lawn of Town Hall, where they continued the debate in small groups.
Ms. Beck said she was upset that some local people had threatened to harm her sheep. When she discovered Monday night that the baling twine she used to tie the gate had been cut, that was the last straw.
"This is a whole new type of democracy we have in Orwell," she said angrily. "The minority rules here."
But Doris Wickman, a sheep supporter and member of the Orwell Historical Society, was relieved. " "We in Orwell don't like all this media publicity," she said. "We don't like the way this thing has split the town. I'm glad they did what they did."

President Mikhail S. Gorbachev today accelerated efforts to convince the Western world that this time, he really means it when he says the Soviet Union wants to move swiftly to a market economy, though on his own terms.
In an interview broadcast on Soviet television tonight, after leading a meeting of Soviet officials and scientists on privatization, he said he had accepted an invitation to address the leaders of seven industrialized democracies in London next month after their summit meeting July 15-17. 
 "Some say Gorbachev is going to London as a blackmailer, others say he's going as a supplicant," he said, playing down to his Soviet audience the idea that the Soviet Union would get large-scale Western aid only by giving in to Western demands. "All this is not serious, it's superficial and irresponsible. Nobody's going to to put anyone on his knees, nobody's going to dictate to anyone."
Jacques Attali, President of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, said after meeting with Mr. Gorbachev this morning that he thought the Soviet leader was "fully committed to a market economy." But Mr. Gorbachev, who faces strong resistance from Communist e hard-liners at home, is clearly eager to be seen here as speeding reforms for his own reasons, and not as a capitulation to the West.
 
$702 Million for Soviet Projects
 By the same token, some Western leaders are bending over backward to avoid putting Mr. Gorbachev into an uncomfortable position.
Mr. Attali said today that he would like to have the authority to invest more than the $702 million his bank now can apply to projects in the Soviet Union. He said Mr. Gorbachev had also accepted an invitation to talk with officials of the bank during his visit to London next month.
"They're going in the right direction, but there is a need to clarify a certain number of things: the relationship between the center and the republics, the stabilization of the money supply, taxes, and precise laws on privatization, separating the state from capital," Mr. Attali said at a news conference. "It can't be done overnight."
 
Pressure on Gorbachev
 Some of the answers might come if Mr. Gorbachev and Boris N. Yeltsin, the newly elected President of the Russian Republic, can agree on elements of a new seven-year plan to integrate the Soviet Union into the world economic system that was worked out by Soviet and American economists in Cambridge, Mass., earlier this week.
The main Soviet architect of the plan, Grigory A. Yavlinsky, an economist with ties to Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Yeltsin, will show it to Mr. Gorbachev at the beginning of the week, according to his associates here. The American version of the still largely secret plan will be presented to President Bush at about the same time, Mr. Yavlinsky told the Soviet newspaper Izvestia on Friday.
The election of Mr. Yeltsin, who supports radical economic change in the country's largest republic, will increase pressure on Mr. Gorbachev and his Government to agree to the new plan, Mr. Yeltsin's supporters say, but there are still questions here about how the authorities intend to proceed.
Mr. Attali seemed to hint after seeing Mr. Gorbachev in the Kremlin today that a currency revision that would replace or sharply devalue the ruble could be in the offing.
The ruble is now nearly worthless as a means of acquiring goods and services Russians want to buy. They pay 30 to 35 rubles apiece for United States dollars instead. Mr. Attali, reporting that he and Mr. Gorbachev had discussed the importance of achieving "internal convertibility" of the ruble as a first step in getting Soviet inflation under control, was asked what that term meant. Other Soviet officials have used it frequently as well.
"I can't comment," the French banker said. "It is a very sensitive matter."
But Valentin S. Pavlov, the Soviet Prime Minister, said in an interview with the Government newspaper Izvestia today that the withdrawal from circulation of 50- and 100-ruble notes last winter had not achieved its purpose of drastically reducing the stock of illicitly obtained money in circulation. The run on already scarce consumer goods has continued even after prices on bread and most other household products were raised last spring, leaving store shelves largely empty, he said.
"Instead of tens of billions of rubles," he said, "we got ten."
People and companies that could prove they had acquired the large notes by legal means were able to exchange them for smaller ones. The overall money supply, which has been growing as fast as the Government can print bills, remains too high, having grown 20 percent a year for the last two years.
"Exchanging the notes was not currency reform," Mr. Pavlov said.
What the Soviet Union needs before a market economy can even begin to get going here, even some Soviet Communist Party members agree, are three things: clarity in national and republic laws about the nature of private ownership of business or property, goods that people want to buy, and money that has the confidence of buyers and sellers. None of those conditions exists now, and from all accounts it will take years to put them all in place.
"If you could freely buy and sell and acquire property or land or businesses in rubles, then you could say they were 'internally convertible,' " said Alexander Papachristou of the American law firm White & Case, whose office has the somewhat unenviable job of advising would-be foreign investors in businesses here.
As it is, many Russians here in the capital prefer to use dollars or German marks, and Mr. Papachristou, who has studied the regulations that Mr. Gorbachev, Mr. Pavlov and the Soviet state bank have promulgated, supposedly to undergird the move to a market economy, finds much to be puzzled about.
"By Aug. 1," he said, "regulations promulgated by the state bank will make it necessary for every joint venture here to get a license to sell goods retail for foreign currency. These regulations affect all business activity in the country today, and are starkly at odds with the assertion made by Gorbachev and others that the country is moving toward a market economy and opening to foreign investors.
The regulations also heavily tax foreign-currency earnings of companies here and, in theory, bar foreign-owned joint ventures from paying their employees except with rubles they do not want, he said.
And the latest published version of a draft law on privatization and what the law calls "destatization" of state-run enterprises makes clear that the state will retain a considerable say in their affairs even after they are sold to private investors or stockholders, according to Mr. Papachristou.
 
People Tired of Promises
 "I haven't yet seen a plan that convinces me that they mean to go to privatization as we understand it," a Western diplomat said. "But my guess is that the political factors are now going to force Gorbachev to move in a more radical direction again. He must have gotten the point that the West is not going to move unless he does."
Mr. Pavlov told Izvestia, "People are tired not only of all kinds of shortages, but of promises to replace them with prosperity," acknowledging that Mr. Gorbachev had been talking about economic changes since 1986 with little to show for it. After rejecting one plan to move to a market economy in 400 days, last year he turned down another one to do it in 500 days.
The state budget deficit soared to more than 100 billion rubles, panicking consumers who snatched bread, clothing and meat off the shelves. In the first quarter of this year, the national income fell by 12 percent.
The Soviet leader and Mr. Yavlinsky have been playing down the amount of Western economic aid and grants that the Soviet Union would need to throw off the legacy of three quarters of a century of Communism and rejoin the developed world, probably because, if it ever happens, it would take hundreds of billions of dollars.
Izvestia asked Mr. Yavlinsky if his plan contained a specific figure.
"It does," he replied. "And what is it?" Izvestia said. "I won't say," Mr. Yavlinsky answered.

HEADLINE: Security Seen as a Dividend of Soviet Aid

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 15

 BODY:
As a debate simmers in Washington over what sort of economic aid the United States should extend to the Soviet Union if it adopts democratic, free-market reforms, the question inevitably arises: what is in it for the United States?
The answer from many of those who favor aid, including economists, members of Congress and Administration officials, is that the payoff for the United States -- if there is one -- will be primarily in political-security terms and not economic ones. 
 "For the United States, the case for Soviet aid is really a political call, not an economic one," said Robert D. Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International and former Assistant Secretary of State for Economic Affairs.
 
Buying a Tranquilizer
 "If you really want to get some economic bang for the 30 billion in bucks people are talking about, there would be a lot better way to spend it," Mr. Hormats said. "If the aid works, what you are buying is an economic tranquilizer designed to stabilize a potentially chaotic situation in the Soviet Union, in order to permit a transition to a free market and more democratic confederation of some sort."
To be sure, whether the Administration chooses to develop a Soviet economic rescue package will depend primarily on the seriousness of the Soviet Union's own rescue plans, or as President Bush said Friday: "The reforms have got to be detailed a bit more before blank checks are written, and even then it would be difficult. We're not rolling in cash."
But Mr. Hormats said the size of any aid program would also depend on "how desperate" the Administration believed the political situation in the Soviet Union to be, whether it was in the national security interests of the United States to try to stabilize it and whether that would be possible with any amount of money. Hopes for immediate benefits to the American economy will be secondary.
Indeed, Administration officials acknowledge that the key factor prompting President Bush this week to grant Mr. Gorbachev's request for $1.5 billion in additional credits to buy American food was a fear that food shortages in the Soviet Union, coupled with political turmoil, might lead the country to implode before any reform program could be instituted.
 
Possible Global Consequences
 Since the Soviet Union occupies one-sixth of the world's landmass, has 12,000 nuclear missiles, countless conventional weapons and some 50 nuclear reactors, a few billion dollars in credits is deemed a small price to pay for helping to prevent political and economic turmoil there, the consequences of which could be global, officials say.
"Spending American tax dollars to aid the Soviet economic transformation is the easiest proposition in the world to mock," said Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard University economist who has been working with Soviet economists on a five-year, $100 billion reform plan. "But those who want to stand by and see the Soviet Union collapse have an incredible lack of historical memory."
Americans are taking for granted the cooperation exhibited by the Soviet Union in recent years on a broad front including Eastern Europe and the Persian Gulf war, Mr. Sachs said.
"Do we really want to wait for a right-wing backlash in the Soviet Union, produced by a sense of failure, paranoia and anger about losing the cold war?" he added. "We will very much regret that. That is exactly the sort of sentiment that produced a man like Hitler after the First World War."
Not everyone, though, accepts this aid-to-prevent-nuclear-chaos argument.
"I think that it's somewhere between a new form of nuclear blackmail and gross exaggeration," Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, said in an interview on the Public Broadcasting System foreign affairs television series "American Interests." "The fact is that the Soviet military is in control of the nuclear weapons, they're primarily controlled by Russians in Russia and I don't think that it's a serious, very serious problem."
 
Some See Political Benefits
 Nevertheless, the potential benefits in American national security terms go beyond preventing nuclear chaos. Virtually all of the leading economists and lawmakers now advocating some American aid package do so on the condition that it not be paid out unless the Soviets take concrete steps to transform their economy from central control to a free market and their polity from a Communist system to a democratic one.
If such a transformation can be promoted, said Stanley Fischer, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist working with the Soviet Union, "you will end up with both a democratic and capitalist Soviet Union, and the fact is you find very few wars between democracies."
When Representative David R. Obey, the Wisconsin Democrat who is chairman of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on international operations, is asked by constituents why their tax dollars should go to help transform the Soviet economy, this political point is where he takes off from.
"We now have the opportunity to participate in the most fundamental change in a major society in the 20th century and to help shape that society in a way that will give us an opportunity to minimize our defense expenditures," Mr. Obey said. "We now spend $120 billion a year on military expenditures, which principally involve the defense of Western Europe from the Soviet Union.
"If we can promote democratic changes in the Soviet Union that will allow us to reduce that by only 10 percent a year, you could still save a lot more than the few billion that anyone up here is talking about for programs to promote Soviet reform. It makes sense financially, it makes sense economically and it makes sense in security terms. The most expensive thing would be to do nothing."
 
Effect on Eastern Europe
 Mr. Sachs argued that to think that an internal explosion in the Soviet Union would not have a spillover effect in Eastern Europe or the Muslim nations to the south would be "extremely naive." The Soviet Army remains in Germany and Poland, and its withdrawal from Eastern Europe could easily be derailed by internal turmoil.
Eastern European economies have already been badly hurt by the fact that the Soviet authorities have halted virtually all of the barter arrangements they had and are now insisting on being paid hard currency for Soviet oil exports. Because the Eastern Europeans are short of hard currency, they are having to look to the West for help in buying oil and have lost about 50 percent of their exports by no longer having access to many Soviet markets.
"So here we are pumping money into Eastern Europe to support reforms there, and it is being offset by the economic downturn in the Soviet Union," Mr. Sachs said. "And ask yourself: How many Western businessmen are going to want to invest in Eastern Europe if the Soviet Union is exploding next door? Imagine the refugee problems for Eastern Europe that would cause. You can't bottle up turmoil."
Finally, an orderly transition to democracy in the Soviet Government would, almost by definition, have to be accompanied by granting republics the right of self-determination, and that means the Baltic republics of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia would be much more likely to find a nonviolent path to independence, which has been a basic objective of American foreign policy.
On the purely economic side, the Soviet Union with its 290 million people and vast natural resources represents an enormously attractive potential market if its resources could be fully tapped through a free-market system. But there would be little direct benefit to the American economy, except for certain sectors like consumer product and food producers, oil and gas equipment manufacturers and machine tool makers. The most immediate beneficiaries would be the Europeans in general and the East Europeans in particular, given their historical trade links with the Soviet Union.

HEADLINE: Census Study Finds Drop in Homeownership

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 15

 BODY:
Many Americans, particularly minority members, young people and single people, are finding the prospect of owning their own homes more and more elusive as homeownership rates decline in the country, a Census Bureau study says.
The report found that 57 percent of all owners and renters could not afford to buy a median-priced house with a conventional, 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage. Thirty-six percent of current homeowners and 91 percent of renters did not qualify for such a property. 
 Even a modestly priced house is too expensive for 48 percent of the nation's households, according to the report, made public on Thursday. It said 15 percent could not afford to buy a home at even the lowest prices.
 
Findings Still Apply
 Findings of the study, which analyzed the income, debt levels and savings of 12,000 households surveyed in the spring of 1988, are still valid three years later, said Howard A. Savage, a Census Bureau statistician who wrote the report with Peter J. Fronczek,
Home prices in many markets have risen less rapidly or even declined and mortgage rates have fallen from between 10 percent and 10.5 percent in 1988 to 9.5 percent this spring. But with the onset of the recession, fewer lenders are offering mortgages with low down payments.
"This seems to be telling us that the step from renting to homeownership is a big step for a large number of households and perhaps a bigger step than was generally realized," said Mark Obrinsky, an economist with the Federal National Mortgage Association.
The study found sharp differences in the ability to buy a home by region, age, marital status and race or ethnic background.
For example, 77 percent of black families and 74 percent of Hispanic families could not buy a median-priced home, as against 43 percent of white buyers and 46 percent of non-Hispanic buyers.
Thirty-nine percent of married couples could not afford a median-priced house, as against 75 percent of all single people and 87 percent of single women with children.
Twenty-seven percent of families headed by people between 55 and 64 years old could not buy a home as against 94 percent of families headed by a person younger than 25.
By region, the proportion of households that could not afford a median-priced house were: the West, 63 percent; Northeast, 59 percent; South, 56 percent, and Midwest, 51 percent. The median prices were Northeast, $100,000; West, $95,000, and Midwest and South, $60,000.
A median-priced house is one that is more expensive than half the homes in a market and less expensive than half. A modestly priced house was defined as one that costs less than 75 percent of the homes in the market.
 
Lower Rates Had Little Effect
 Mr. Savage said the study's most surprising finding was that lower interest rates, which mean lower monthly mortgage payments, did almost nothing to improve renters' prospects of buying homes.
"It helps some, but it's not statistically significant," Mr. Savage said. "They just flat don't have the money. You can lower monthly payments, but if they don't have enough for a down payment then it's an irrelevant question."
The problem of declining homeownership rates is not new. After rising steadily, to 66 percent in 1980 from 55 percent in 1950, the rate edged down to 64 percent in 1990.

First Lady Urges Tolerance at Northeastern Graduation

 BODY:
Barbara Bush stressed the importance of tolerance in a speech to the graduating class of Northeastern University yesterday.
"Real tolerance is an ideal our country has strived for from its beginning," Mrs. Bush said to the 2,155 graduates of the Boston institution's nine undergraduate colleges. "America was founded as a haven for tolerance of people of all kinds. Certainly we've made progress, but we still have a long, long way to go." 
 Mrs. Bush was awarded an honorary doctor of public service degree at the school's 90th commencement.
Others recognized for achievement were Brig. Gen. Richard Neal, the Marine spokesman in the Persian Gulf war; Representative Nicholas Mavroules, Democrat of Massachusetts; Bernard Solomon, former executive vice president of the Bank of New England Corporation, and Norman Rosenblatt, dean of Northeastern University's College of Criminal Justice.
Also given honorary degrees were Harvey Krentzman, president of Advanced Management Associates; Bill White, president of the National League of Professional Baseball Clubs, and Robert Bateman, a Canadian artist.
 
Chicago University
 The art of the argument and what can be learned from debating was the last lesson for graduates at the University of Chicago's 99th commencement yesterday.
The convocation speaker, Wayne C. Booth, the school's George Pullman distinguished service professor emeritus, addressed 1,674 undergraduates and graduates in three ceremonies yesterday and Friday.
"One sign that any graduate has moved beyond training toward genuine education is exhibited in a kind of conversation, the kind in which both parties act not just as teachers but as learners," he said.
Honorary degrees were given to Robert C. Merton, a Harvard University economist; Jacques H. Dreze, the founder of the Center for Operations Research and Econometrics in Belgium; Gordon H. Bower, a psychologist at Stanford; Thomas R. Cech, a chemist at the University of Colorado; James A. Miller, an oncologist in Wisconsin, and Oliver Smithies, a pathologist in North Carolina.
 
 Bennington College
 Harvey Gantt, the Democratic candidate who ran unsuccessfully against Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, last fall, gave the commencement address on Friday at Bennington College in Bennington, Vt. It was the 56th annual commencement for the liberal arts college, and 130 bachelor's degrees were awarded. Mr. Gantt, an architect and businessman, is a former Mayor of Charlotte, N.C.

HEADLINE: William Lewis Dies; Economics Laureate And Adviser Was 76

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO

 BODY:
William Arthur Lewis, a Princeton University professor emeritus who was an adviser to several nations and won the Nobel Prize in economics in 1979, died yesterday at his home in Barbados. He was 76 years old.
Mr. Lewis was widely considered an authority on economic growth and political and social change in emerging nations. He shared the Nobel Prize with Theodore W. Schultz, a University of Chicago professor, for research into economic development "with particular consideration of the problems of developing countries." 
 In 1954, Mr. Lewis published what many economists considered one of the first academic works in this area, "The Theory of Economic Growth." He also wrote 11 other books and more than 80 monographs and articles.
Mr. Lewis was born on St. Lucia in 1915 and was educated at the University of London, where he earned his bachelor's degree in 1937 and a doctorate in 1940. He taught there until 1948 when he left for the University of Manchester. He was named vice-chancellor of the University of the West Indies in Kingston, Jamaica, in 1959.
He joined Princeton's faculty in 1963 and was named the James Madison Profesor of Political Economy. He taught undergraduate and graduate courses in economic development and modern economic history.
Mr. Lewis is survived by his wife, Gladys Jacobs Lewis of Barbados and Princeton, N.J.; two daughters, Elizabeth Lewis of Cranbury, N.J., and Barbara Lewis of Brooklyn, and four brothers, Stanley Lewis of Ghana, Earl Lewis of Trinidad, Allen Lewis, a former Governor-General of St. Lucia, and Victor Lewis of St. Lucia.
A state funeral is planned for June 22 on St. Lucia.

HEADLINE: The Nation;
Minority Leaders See A Clash of Hues In a Rainbow Coalition

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AS they have throughout the civil rights struggle, black and Hispanic leaders like to project an aura of solidarity -- at least in public. Yet, bubbling just beneath the surface are political and social tensions that threaten to undermine gains made by both.
Spokesmen for Hispanic groups say that blacks, with their political strength and with a sense that the term "civil rights" is synonymous with "black," have received a disproportionate share of jobs, power and media attention, often at the expense of Latins. 
 Among many blacks, the sentiment seems to be that Hispanic claims are Johnny-come-lately, largely coming on the heels of progress charted and achieved by blacks. The views of these blacks may be best summed up in the words of Clarence Mitchell, who was a lobbyist for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. He once told Hispanic leaders, "Blacks were dying for the right to vote when you people couldn't decide whether you were Caucasians."
The strain between the two largest minority groups is tinged with mutual distrust and tempered by mutual need. Both sides know that the political power of the rainbow coalition envisioned in recent Presidential election years cannot be fully harnessed without cooperation. Blacks realize that their numbers will soon be overshadowed by Hispanic population gains. Hispanic leaders are all too aware that the cultural diversity and large immigrant population within their own ranks has prevented the kind of unity that black politics has mustered and that they need.
The riot in the Mount Pleasant neighborhood of the nation's capital last month was only the latest manifestation of the racial tension. The disturbance, touched off when a black policewoman wounded a knife-wielding Salvadoran immigrant, was accompanied by charges from Hispanic leaders that the city's largely black political power structure ignores Hispanic needs.
Washington is not alone. Across the country, the two groups are vying for political power and competing for ever-shrinking funds for education, employment, health care and housing programs.
 
The Different Agendas
 For example, though Hispanic residents make up about 20 percent of Chicago's population, only 2.2 percent of the apartments managed by the Chicago Housing Authority have Hispanic tenants. By comparison, blacks lease 86.8 percent of the apartments, though they make up about 40 percent of the city's population.
 On the Federal level, blacks, who make up 12.1 percent of the population nationwide, hold 17.8 percent of the jobs in the civilian work force. But Hispanic Americans, who are roughly 9 percent of the population, hold only 5.1 percent. Hispanic leaders say this results in skewed enforcement of civil rights laws. They note that only 5 percent of the discrimination charges filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 1989 involved Hispanic complainants.
The two groups have also clashed over the redrawing of district lines for Federal and local offices in New York, Chicago, Houston and Los Angeles. Last year, a dispute over immigration law almost resulted in the walkout of Hispanic groups from the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, the main lobbying arm of the civil rights movement. Only last-minute pleading by Benjamin L. Hooks, executive director of the N.A.A.C.P., prevented the action. But Mr. Hooks plays down the notion that there is a problem. "People keep stirring up stuff that wasn't happening," he said.
Raul Yzaguirre, president of the National Council of La Raza, the largest Hispanic civil rights organization, and many others disagree. "It's not a question of potential problems," he said. "They're happening all over the country."
Indeed, last July a group of black and Hispanic scholars and political leaders met at Harvard University to privately air differences. "Hispanics believe that blacks embrace the rhetoric, but not the values promoted by the civil rights movement," Charles Kamasaki, vice president of the National Council of La Raza told the gathering.
To several blacks at the session such statements were an eerie echo of complaints they made years ago about white liberals. "I felt very sympathetic with the frustrations and aspirations that were voiced," said Christopher Edley Jr., a Harvard Law School professor who is black. "But it is also clear that many blacks will feel uncomfortable that a group which had been junior partners becomes co-equals, if not more."
Nevertheless, the subject is being addressed in more and more forums. At a meeting of the United States Conference of Mayors in San Diego this weekend, Mayor W. Wilson Goode of Philadelphia said that he and other big city mayors should help other minority groups gain political influence.
"It's very difficult to open the doors overnight," he said. But he added: "All of us need to do some soul-searching about how we use our offices for inclusion."
To some conservatives the stresses between the two groups are a logical result of civil rights laws that they say seek to enshrine a concept of proportional representation in employment and political power. "I think that the civil rights laws really now play into the hands of raw racial politics," said Clint Bolick, director of the Landmark Legal Center for Civil Rights, a conservative public policy organization.
Others assert that the laws have simply provided the opportunity to compete for power.
"The Irish and Italians battled it out in Boston and New York over who would dominate the police force and ward politics," said Professor Edley. "It had nothing to do with affirmative action. It's just a historical phenomenon of urban life that groups compete. I think it's a sign of political progress."

HEADLINE: The World;
Yeltsin's Gain in Clout Is Dramatic, But Gorbachev Still Has the Real Power

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
FOR all the excitement and familiar trap pings of the race the whirlwind campaign tours, multiple candidates, rich promises and even dirty tricks -- the presidential election in the Russian Federation last week was still not a presidential election in the Western sense.
 For one thing, it was not exactly clear what powers Boris N. Yeltsin had gained and what he could do with them. For another, it was still an election only in one constituent republic, even if this one happened to comprise three-fourths of the Soviet Union and half its people. 
 None of this took away from the importance of the election as a dramatic step in the fascinating process through which democracy is struggling to be born in the Soviet land. By giving 60 percent of their vote to Mr. Yeltsin despite a determined challenge from the Communists, Russian voters handed the champion of decentralization and democratization a potent mandate in his struggle against stubborn rear-guard actions from the "center." Perhaps more significant, they moved one step closer toward overcoming Russia's ancient tradition of government as a dispensation from on high.
But to appreciate what the election was, it is important first to understand what it was not.
The Russian presidency was conceived more as a political maneuver than as a democratic institution. Mr. Yeltsin proposed the office for much the same reason that Mikhail S. Gorbachev created an all-union presidency last fall, to give the chief executive some independence from a quarrelsome and ponderous parliament. The main difference was that Mr. Gorbachev had himself elected by the Supreme Soviet, while Mr. Yeltsin, confident of his popularity, went to the voters.
But in the improvisational and evolutionary game of Soviet politics, it is still not clear what powers and levers of national sovereignty Mr. Yeltsin won. Already as president of the Russian parliament he could issue decrees and had announced a program of radical economic change. Often, though, these steps were undone by the Kremlin.
So even with added clout from his new mandate and title, Mr. Yeltsin's authority is likely to remain ill-defined and incomplete until Russia and other constituent republics reach a satisfactory union agreement with Mr. Gorbachev and the center, clearly delineating constitutional responsibilities and powers.
Meanwhile, it is still Mr. Gorbachev who holds the ultimate reins over the military, the K.G.B. and most national assets. Significant as it was as a first for Russia, the election was not yet the national election that reformers, with Mr. Yeltsin at their head, have increasingly demanded of Mr. Gorbachev.
 Mr. Yeltsin's victory may have prompted President Bush to invite him to the White House, but it is still Mr. Gorbachev and the center who will have the last word on the "Grand Bargain" to exchange Western dollars for Soviet reforms, as proposed last week by an unofficial team of Soviet and American economic experts.
All this, however, is not to say that the Russian election was no more than an elaborate referendum. The very fact that the Communists fought Mr. Yeltsin so fiercely gave the voting national significance and imbued his victory with tangible political authority.
 Mr. Yeltsin had clearly demonstrated his popularity, had insulated himself from the wiles of the hostile Communist bloc in the Russian parliament, and had collected a new mandate for the contest with Mr. Gorbachev over the shape and identity of the evolving Soviet state.
 
A Truce
 That long struggle arrived at a truce in late April when both realized that Mr. Yeltsin's popularity neutralized Mr. Gorbachev's powers and vice versa. The feud showed that no economic reform, no matter how bold or well conceived, could take hold without political stability.
The truce, reached between Mr. Gorbachev and leaders of nine republics, opened the way to negotiating a new union treaty. Mr. Gorbachev seems to accept that in these talks the republics will be recognized as sovereign and will themselves determine what responsibilities to cede to the central government.
All through Soviet history, power has flowed only in one direction, from the Kremlin down through the ministries and party organizations, the K.G.B., the 15 constituent republics and on to the lowly citizen in whose name it was all done. Rights or privileges were bestowed from above -- and withdrawn at will.
Mr. Gorbachev's initial concept of perestroika was largely an enlightened variation on the theme: a new, more liberal dispensation from the center. But whenever his creation has tried to assert a life of its own, Mr. Gorbachev has acted in the paternalistic tradition he was reared in, trying to rein in his willful child.
 More than any other leader, Mr. Yeltsin has come to represent that enfant terrible. Armed with a keen political instinct and a populist touch, he has learned to harness the popular forces unleashed by perestroika to defy and challenge Mr. Gorbachev at every turn, steadily chipping at the center's powers.
The process has been frustrating and dangerous at times, and may yet have its twists and turns. But its effect has been the gradual reinvention of democracy in a land with pitifully little experience of it. Perhaps there is a lesson of history that many forgot in the early euphoria of perestroika -- that democratic institutions and traditions do not spring up full grown, but must grow organically from perceived needs and political struggle. Such was the Russian presidency. Conceived as a political maneuver, its consequences not really known, it still served as a significant step in the evolution of a new social contract.
It is unlikely that Mr. Gorbachev was too happy with the outcome, given his antipathy to Mr. Yeltsin. But as an astute politician, he may recognize that he too may have won. It was his truce with Mr. Yeltsin, more than anything else, that set off the events leading to his invitation to London, where the major industrial powers will meet next month.
In the longer term, the election appears likely to accelerate the drive toward a new union treaty and the first free election of a truly national leader in the Soviet Union. Should Mr. Gorbachev win that, he could end up with far more real authority than he now has, trying to hold together the rump of a discredited and rotten dictatorship.

Bridgeport Declares It Can't Go It Alone

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON

DATELINE: BRIDGEPORT, CONN.

 BODY:
BY resorting to bankruptcy court June 6, this city, located in one of the wealthiest counties in the nation, issued a declaration of dependence: Bridgeport's problems were no longer its alone, but also those of its suburban neighbors and the state.
Last week the city's aldermen furthered that declaration by raising property taxes much less than needed to balance its $319.4 million budget. If Bridgeport succeeds in filing for bankruptcy it intends to operate at a deficit, in defiance of the state financial review board that has supervised the city for the last three years. 
 The court will decide next month whether this community of 141,800, Connecticut's largest city, can claim protection under Chapter 9 of the Federal bankruptcy laws. In papers filed Wednesday, Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said the city lost its right to seek protection when it accepted the review board's authority in 1988 in return for help in selling bonds to cover a $60 million deficit.
One goal of Bridgeport's bankruptcy is to escape the review board's authority and its requirement of a balanced budget, which would mean either raising the property-tax rate, already the highest in the state, by 18 percent; or ending garbage collection and laying off police officers. The budget already eliminates street cleaning and other programs.
Another immediate goal is to use bankruptcy to renegotiate union contracts Bridgeport considers "onerous and economically burdensome," according to the bankruptcy papers. But many state and local officials say such a course was unnecessary. Some unions had already offered concessions, but Mayor Mary C. Moran could not, or did not want to, follow through.
"She's seen fit to have unions seen as those who are really bankrupting the city," said Cesar A. Batalla, a review board member and president of the city's Puerto Rican Coalition, a civil-rights group. "But they never ran the city."
Everyone agrees on the more distant goal of stabilizing the tax rate to stem the flight of businesses and the middle class, and being able to compete with suburban communities for new jobs. In particular Bridgeport sees its Long Island Sound waterfront as a site for more marinas, shops and middle-class housing, instead of the sewage plants, public housing projects and closed factories that dominate it now.
"We're hoping, as things develop, that the burden of taxes will shift from the residential to business, commercial and industrial," said Luca Cardozo, an administrative aide to the Mayor.
Such stabilization, however, would require Bridgeport and other cities to succeed where they failed in this spring's legislative session in Hartford: they must change how Connecticut, with its system of strong home rule, views cities and suburbs essentially as equals.
The cities want the state to stop mandating programs it fails to finance. They also want it to provide more tax relief and school aid and to move toward regional solutions to affordable housing and other problems that concentrate the poor in cities.
Those problems often result in a stark contrast between Bridgeport and its suburbs. Much of it is economic: in 1987, the last year for which census data are available, per capita income was $10,534 in Bridgeport, $20,954 in Fairfield and $18,712 in Trumbull. Connecticut's average was $16,094.
 
A Second Parachute, of a Sort
 The disparity in wealth carries over to property. Bridgeport's tax rolls, which haven't grown in two years, total $2.302 billion, less than the $2.34 billion in neighboring Fairfield, a suburb with only 53,400 residents. One result is Bridgeport's tax rate is twice as high.
Because Connecticut has no regional government, the area's homeless shelters, drug-treatment centers, public housing, hospitals and other services are almost all in Bridgeport, using the city's streets and sewers, fire and police, yet paying no taxes. The city has 22,800 residents on welfare, or 15 percent of the population.
On Thursday the financial review board ordered Bridgeport to balance its budget and threatened more legal action if it did not.
 Officials in New Haven, which is considered to be right behind Bridgeport in fiscal crisis, vow not to follow suit. New Haven has a stronger economic base, said its chief administrative officer, Douglas Rae, who is on leave from Yale, where he is a political science professor. New Haven often complains of Yale's nonprofit status, but Yale provides a solid employment base, he said. Its corporations pay a larger share of the taxes than in Bridgeport, where homeowners pay 70 percent.
New Haven is like a parachutist who has just pulled the string on his first parachute, Mr. Rae said. Bridgeport "pulled its first parachute and it didn't work," he said. "Now it's pulled its second."

HEADLINE: The World;
Displaced in the Gulf War: 5 Million Refugees

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER

 BODY:
IT took Iraqi soldiers less than four hours to cross the 80 miles of desert between Iraq and Kuwait City last Aug. 2. But that audacious move set off what is now regarded as one of history's largest, fastest and most widespread migrations. While the statistics are still being compiled, American officials and representatives of international relief organizations estimate that at least 5 million people from more than 30 countries have been temporarily or permanently displaced by the crisis in the Persian Gulf.
"A world on the move" was how one State Department refugee official characterized the migration. Another official, Princeton N. Lyman, Director of the State Department's Bureau for Refugee Programs, called the displacement, particularly the phase caused by Iraq's civil warfare this spring, "a human tragedy of tremendous proportions." And Court Robinson, a senior research analyst at the U.S. Committee for Refugees, a private, nonprofit group in Washington, said, "This was surely one of the largest migrations ever; I can't recall an instance in which so many people moved in so short a time." 
Until the last disastrous phase of the migration, there were no epidemics and few displacement-related deaths. "The people who fled Iraq and Kuwait for Jordan soon after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait were horribly confused and disoriented by their sudden plunge from middle-class status to instant poverty," said Philippe L. Boulle, director of the New York office of the United Nations Disaster Relief Organization. "But unlike migrants in Africa, they were physically strong enough to withstand a few days of poor conditions. As a result, virtually no one died."
The people who fled in March during the Iraqi civil war were less fortunate. The State Department says that at least 6,700 Iraqis, most of them Kurds, died in Turkish refugee camps near the border. In addition, the image remains of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis, again mostly Kurds, who did not reach those camps and were stranded on wintry mountain roads stretching 165 miles into harsh, remote terrain -- a "logistics nightmare," said Mr. Lyman. No one will ever know just how many of these terrified, desperate people, mired in a mixture of mud and excrement, died of hunger or exposure. Doctors Without Borders, the French group of volunteer doctors, estimated that at the peak of the crisis, 1,000 Kurds a day were dying.
The relatively low death rate throughout most of the crisis is attributed to a fast and well coordinated international relief effort. James N. Purcell Jr., director general of the Geneva-based International Organization for Migration, said his group airlifted more than 200,000 people to about a dozen countries with no loss of life. Countries throughout the world have contributed about $1.35 billion in emergency aid.
 
Economic Misery
 Though the death rate was low, the first-wave migrants have faced not only debts, but the loss of back wages, unemployment compensation and abandoned savings, says a report issued last month by the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, a privately funded human rights group. "They were often abused and discriminated against in the gulf," said Arthur C. Helton, of the Lawyers Committee. "But despite this, they've lost jobs they will never find at home" Their own countries, most of them poor, have also paid heavily in the loss of foreign exchange and remittances, slowing of economic growth, and the addition of burdens to school and social-service systems that have often strained them beyond capacity.
Officials in Bangladesh, for example, estimate that a million dependents relied on the incomes of about 110,000 Bangladeshis who worked in Kuwait and Iraq, and that these people and their country, one of the world's poorest, have lost at least $45 million in revenues; in addition, the Government spent $36 million to bring stranded workers home. Before the invasion of Kuwait, Pakistanis throughout the Middle East had been sending home between $1 billion and $2 billion a year, and about 15 percent of this had been coming from 160,000 workers in Kuwait and Iraq.
Officials break the migration into three phases that correspond roughly to before, during, and after the gulf war. During the first wave, from Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 until the American-led coalition attacked Iraq in January, more than 1.5 million people fled Iraq, Kuwait and other gulf countries. They included some 700,000 Egyptians, 380,000 Kuwaitis, 250,000 Palestinians or Jordanians and more than 350,000 Asians, most of them from India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Bangladesh and the Philippines. More than 700,000 of them left through Jordan, which initially was overwhelmed but within weeks organized an effective relief campaign.
In addition, about one million Yemenis fled back to Yemen from Saudi Arabia, which strongly encouraged their departure after the Yemeni Government criticized the Saudis for inviting American forces to defend them.
Having been unprepared for the first onslaught of dispossessed, relief organizations were determined to be ready for a second. In early January, they appealed for money to feed, house and transport up to 400,000 additional refugees in the event of war. Millions of dollars were raised to build mobile camps in Syria, Turkey, Iran and Jordan.
 
Surprises
 But from January to mid-March, only 65,000 people fled, about 35,000 of them Iraqis who went to Iran and 28,000 of them Asians or people from other Middle Eastern countries.
What few anticipated -- and hence, no one adequately prepared for -- was the third, most devastating wave of flight, triggered in late March by Iraq's civil war. "More than two million people got up and left their homes in less than six days," Mr. Robinson said.
In late March and early April, the United Nations estimated, 1.5 million Kurds abruptly left for Turkey and Iran. Most have returned, but not necessarily to their homes. The State Department estimates that of the 1.2 million Iraqis known to have fled to Iran -- all but 100,000 of them Kurds -- 500,000 are still in Iran and need help. In addition, Iran says 700,000 to 800,000 Shiite Muslims from Iraq have entered Iran or have sought refuge in marshes near the border, but this has not been independently confirmed.
While most of those displaced in the first wave reached their home countries within a month, people are still dribbling out of the region. Some 2,500 of the more than 16,000 Vietnamese who were working in Iraq showed up last week in a recently erected tent city in Syria. And Jordanian officials recently reported that thousands of cold and hungry people who had been stranded for days at a desert border camp between Iraq and Jordan had been ordered to return to Baghdad -- to obtain exit visas.

Cuomo Lobs 384 Balls Back to the Legislature

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

DATELINE: ALBANY

 BODY:
GOV. MARIO M. CUOMO'S veto of 384 items from the state budget last week led many politicians in Albany to one of two conclusions. Assemblyman William B. Hoyt, a Buffalo Democrat, said the Governor was trying to reassert himself as "the dominant muscular figure in Albany." Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester Democrat, saw the move less as a demonstration of power politics than as the latest volley in a grand "philosophical battle" over the role of state government.
Both interpretations ring true. 
 In striking $937 million in spending from the budget passed by the Legislature on June 4, Mr. Cuomo used an unusually bold maneuver to take control of the budget process he had abandoned a month earlier.
So rarely has Mr. Cuomo used the full force of his office and personality to box in the Legislature that lawmakers were actually stunned when the vetoes were announced on Monday, even though the press had been forecasting the Governor's decision for days.
Deep disagreement over how to spread the pain inflicted by a $6.5 billion budget gap caused the record 65-day delay in passing the $51.9 billion budget. Legislators, who are held accountable by voters for the level of state aid granted to local governments and organizations, agreed that the brunt of the cuts should fall on the state bureaucracy. Mr. Cuomo, who must answer to disgruntled state workers and users of state services, wanted local governments to shoulder an equal burden.
Outraged by the Legislature's cuts of more than $250 million from state agencies, Mr. Cuomo indiscriminately vetoed spending from the programs that legislators hold dearest, including $412 million in state aid to school districts and $145 million in revenue sharing for local governments.
Mr. Cuomo regularly takes credit for increasing the share of state spending that goes to local governments, to 65 percent in 1990 from 60 percent when he took office in 1983. But he made it clear with his vetoes that he could tolerate only so much damage to the state agencies, including the state police, Office of Mental Health and the Department of Transportation.
The legislative response to the vetoes, meanwhile, showed that the Republican-led Senate and the Democratic-led Assembly have forged an alliance to preserve state aid to municipalities.
 Assembly Speaker Mel Miller charged that Mr. Cuomo, who frequently blames the Federal Government for shifting the burden of taxation to the states, was guilty of shifting the same burden to local governments.
"We tried to avoid copying the Federal trend of shifting responsibilities to local governments without providing the resources to support those responsibilities," said Mr. Miller, a Brooklyn Democrat. "Unfortunately, the Governor has chosen a different course for state government to follow."
The Governor replied that the Legislature's argument about the proper role of government did not disguise the real intent of lawmakers -- to win the largest possible share of state aid for their constituents. Legislators from both parties, he said, had refused to reform their habits to reflect the economic reality of the times. The Senate Republicans, with their power base on Long Island, insisted on maintaining high levels of school aid. The Assembly Democrats, with their base in New York City, resisted cuts in Medicaid and welfare programs that would disproportionately harm the city, where most recipients live.
The Governor ridiculed the Legislature's priorities, particularly its decision to spend $60 million on pork-barrel "members items" -- including the promotion of the seafood industry and the building of sound barriers near busy highways -- at the same time it was cutting more than $250 million from vital state agencies.
 There was a broad speculation in Albany about why the Governor chose to veto virtually everything he could. Some were convinced that Mr. Cuomo sincerely believed that the Legislature had passed a budget that was $899 million out of balance. Others said, and the Governor essentially conceded as much, that Mr. Cuomo was using the vetoes to reopen negotiations with the Legislature to win back hundreds of millions of dollars that had been cut from his agencies.
Those who analyze every gubernatorial act for evidence of Presidential intent saw the vetoes as an attempt by Mr. Cuomo to shed an image of gubernatorial weakness and profligacy.
"I heard the people talking about treachery and disloyalty and complicated political motivations, running for President, moving to the right, all the schemes," Mr. Cuomo said. "I heard it all, and it's not pleasant to hear."
Whatever his motives, the Governor's strategy seemed to be working. He convinced the legislative leaders to delay considering an override of his vetoes until after the state completes a $3.9 billion borrowing on June 21.
And on Wednesday, the chance for an override in any event diminished greatly when the Assembly minority leader, Clarence D. Rappleyea Jr., announced that the Assembly Republicans would not provide needed votes.
The Legislature doesn't need to override the Governor to answer the challenge of his vetoes; it can simply pass new spending bills at any time. But the maneuvering did suggest that Mr. Cuomo would at least succeed in drawing the Legislature back to the negotiating table, where political victory will be measured by whose philosophy of government prevails and by who shows the most muscle.

HEADLINE: Revolving Accounts;
Are Banks Going Down the Same Path As S.& L.'s?

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AT a time when "savings and loan" has become synonymous with "bottomless pit," warnings last week that the nation's banking system faced worsening problems had an eerie familiarity.
Here was L. William Seidman, who heads both the savings and loan system's bailout and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, once again raising his estimate of the number of banks that are likely to fail and place additional strains on the Government-backed insurance fund that protects deposits. The "pessimistic scenario" that he called unlikely in January is now playing itself out, he said. As many as 440 banks may fail this year and in 1992, costing the insurance fund $23 billion and leaving it with a deficit of nearly $6 billion next year. 
 Parallels to the savings and loan crisis are already being drawn. Steadily worsening reports drip out on the condition of a Government-backed deposit insurance fund. Regulators concede they have not always moved promptly enough to shut down institutions, such as the Bank of New England, and contain their cost. And critics say that the Band-aid solutions being applied, in the form of Treasury borrowing, will do no more than postpone the inevitable bill to taxpayers until after Election Day 1992.
"We're in the grand denial phase, just like 1987 and 1988, when Congress and the Administration did nothing about savings and loans," said Walker Todd, a lawyer who is on leave from the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland to write a book about the Federal Reserve Board.
Between honest differences of opinion and the imperatives of politics, it is difficult to find a consensus on exactly how much trouble the banking system is in and what is likely to happen. Charles A. Bowsher, the Comptroller General, said last week that the industry would probably not be able to pay the Government back if the insurance fund had to borrow the $70 billion from the Treasury that the Bush Administration has said might be needed.
 
Most Make Money
 To be sure, most American banks are posting profits, but a major problem remains: too many of the biggest banks have made too many of the worst loans, resulting in huge losses and longterm weakness.
On Capitol Hill, where the House banking committee is to begin drafting legislation Wednesday to lend billions of dollars of taxpayer money to the battered deposit insurance fund, lawmakers are running scared.
No incumbent sees anything to gain politically by voting to put more public funds at risk, although everyone recognizes something has to be done to avoid further damage to the nation's financial system. Many members blame themselves as much as the regulators and the Reagan Administration for the savings and loan debacle -- Congress, after all, approved the industry's deregulation -- and they see the possibility of a repeat performance.
"It's hard to have any confidence in Congress," said Representative Jim Leach, Republican of Iowa. "Everyone is bracing themselves for more bad news. The membership in general looks at this with a jaundiced eye."
President Bush, who met separately last week with House and Senate leaders to jawbone on behalf of his legislation, is trying to use the plight of the insurance fund as the engine to pull a trainload of structural changes to the banking system.
 
Obfuscation?
 Mr. Bush's sweeping plan would free the industry of decades-old restrictions that prevent banks from expanding into new businesses and across state lines.
Some say that the Bush proposals obscure the real problem and would merely hide the industry's difficulties -- and the taxpayers' exposure -- until after the 1992 elections. They also maintain that allowing banks to go into new and riskier businesses would simply add to the industry's woes.
"The Administration is so caught up in its grandiose plans for bank restructuring that it is willing to gamble with the deposit insurance fund," said Henry B. Gonzalez, the Texas Democrat who heads the House banking committee. "At the moment, the Administration seems quite willing to rearrange the chairs on the deck of the Titanic while money and confidence flow out of the deposit insurance system."
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady has said that if Congress rejects the Administration's proposal, a taxpayer bailout will be necessary. But those opposed to the legislation say Mr. Brady is merely attempting to pressure Congress and to be in a position to blame Capitol Hill if the lawmakers reject the measure and a disaster follows.
Few are predicting that the banking industry's problems will cost the taxpayers as much as the $130 billion that the Administration says it needs to rescue savings and loans (the General Accounting Office estimates that over 40 years the total bailout cost could be as high as $500 billion). There is general agreement that a banking bailout could cost between $25 billion and $50 billion.
But the news last week from Mr. Seidman, the chairman of the F.D.I.C., was in some ways the worst since the agency was created during the Great Depression. While most of the nation's 12,900 banks are in good shape, the 1,028 teetering ones include some of the largest American banks ever to be in such shaky condition. Federal regulators refuse to identify troubled banks for fear of creating a panic, but financial analysts do so routinely, and those that are publicly traded are readily identifiable by their relatively low share prices.
Most are in the Northeast and Texas, but there are signs that California may be the next region to face a banking crisis.
The latest figures indicate that more than 6 percent of all construction and development loans in the West are delinquent, an early warning signal, according to Mr. Seidman, that the region could be in for harder times. In the Middle West, currently the healthiest region for banks, construction loan delinquencies are running at about half the California rate. The figures also show that among the nation's largest institutions, a whopping 16 percent of all construction and development loans have gone sour.
"You don't need thousands of banks to fail to face a crisis," said James R. Barth, a professor at Auburn University and formerly an economist at the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. "You could have relatively few big ones and the costs would be enormous. That's the difference from the s.& l.'s. Nobody can look at the bank insurance fund and say, 'By God, there are ample reserves to handle these large troubled banks.' This should be maddening to taxpayers."
What's more, regulators have begun to believe that even though the economy is pulling out of the recession, it is not carrying the sick banks with it. Their crisis rests with the commercial real estate markets, which experts say could take years to turn around, and may hardly be affected by a recovery that many economists predict will be sluggish.
 "Most banks are doing better," Mr. Seidman said last week. "But the troubled banks are not doing better. And clearly, the big problems are at the bigger banks."
By the F.D.I.C.'s reckoning, if Congress does nothing, the bank insurance fund, which only four years ago was $18.3 billion, will be in the red by almost $6 billion next year. What makes the report so unsettling is that the F.D.I.C.'s forecasts have been less reliable than the typical weather man, generally erring on the side of optimism.
Each new estimate over the last year has predicted a darker gathering storm, and the regulators themselves say the numbers are only their best guess, even though they are based on the most reliable information available from the banks themselves. Mr. Seidman once predicted a profit for the F.D.I.C. in 1991, meaning it would take in more in premiums than it paid out in claims. Now he says it could be a year of record losses.
"Their forecasts have been ostrich-like," said Robert Litan of the Brookings Institution.
Nor would it be particularly reassuring if the industry is able to repay the loans that will be taken from Treasury. The increase in bank premiums to pay off the borrowing will inevitably be passed on to the public in the form of higher fees and lower returns. The losses will also be felt by bank shareholders.
"You can't get the money to cover the losses out of thin air," said John G. Medlin Jr., chairman of the First Wachovia Corporation of Winston-Salem, N.C. "It will have to come from customers and from shareholders."
Ultimately, Mr. Medlin said, the industry's plight will not be resolved by Washington, but by the banks themselves.
"The basic problems of banks are risk management, not what the regulators or the members of Congress are doing," he said. "It's what the managers of the banks are doing, and they have to be more careful about who they are lending money to."

New York City's School Spending: New Math

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
THE New York City school system is often pictured as something of a high roller among the nation's school districts, but a series of recent reports suggests that it spends about as much on each student as other American cities, and is falling behind its own state's average. One major reason is that while New York State's contribution to the city schools has risen, the amount contributed by the city has dropped sharply -- from 24 percent of its tax-levy budget in 1982 to 16.87 percent in 1991.
These disparities were one reason board officials were pleased last week that Mayor David N. Dinkins named H. Carl McCall, a Citibank vice president who served six years as a state senator, to the seven-member board. Mr. Dinkins wants Mr. McCall to become the board's president, an uncertain prospect given the ambitions of the Bronx representative, Ninfa Segarra. 
 But whether Mr. McCall succeeds or not, his contacts and his experience as a consensus builder were widely regarded as long-needed weapons to protect the board's budget against the long knives of fiscally embattled state and city governments. City and state officials are weighing program cuts that would cost the school budget $505 million.
There is, to be sure, an unmeasurable amount of waste in an enterprise of 956,000 pupils, 122,000 workers, 32 school boards and an almost $7 billion budget. Periodic revelations have told of administrators using stationery money to buy themselves office furniture and of computers standing idle in closets.
There are no scholarly measures of how much gets frittered away. Moreover, the schools are troubled by a high, though improving dropout rate. A report last week said that when students are tracked until the age of 21, 29.4 percent drop out, and most students read and calculate below appropriate levels.
But a report by Robert Berne, associate dean of the Wagner School of Public Service at New York University, and Leanna Stiefel, an economics professor there, shows that even with its excesses, New York City spends only 91 percent as much per pupil as the state average, despite its greater burden of poor, handicapped and non-English-speaking students. Fifteen years ago, before the fiscal crisis of the mid-70's, it equaled the state average.
"A student who entered kindergarten in New York City in 1977 received less than three-quarters of the spending of a student in the rest of New York State over the course of the next 13 years," the report asserts.
New York City also did not look as reckless as its legend in a study last month of 10 cities by the accounting firm of Coopers & Lybrand. The study, conducted for a group of business executives advising the Mayor, found that Yonkers spends $8,598 for each of its pupils; Rochester $7,719; Syracuse, $6,754, and New York only $6,146. New York's per-student spending does exceed Philadelphia's at $5,704 and Los Angeles's at $4,675. But, Mr. Berne notes, this state is a more expensive place to do business.
The board spends so little in part because it receives comparatively meager financing from its parent city. Buffalo spends 46.85 percent of its tax-levy budget on schools and Baltimore 24.4 percent while New York City spends only 16.87 percent.
"It is difficult to make an argument that expenditures per pupil are high," Mr. Berne said. "Teacher salaries are below the state average, class size is above the state average and the city spends less on administration than other districts in the state.
 
Catholic Schools
 Even the perennial contrast between New York's schools and those run by the Roman Catholic Church may not be as glaring as commonly characterized.
The argument is often made that schools in the Archdiocese of New York, which includes not only Manhattan, the Bronx and Staten Island but also seven northern counties, spend a fourth as much per pupil -- $1,735 compared to $7,107 -- as public schools do. Yet, they have smaller classes and higher graduation rates.
School officials and scholars like Mr. Berne say that Catholic schools seem frugal partly because a hefty share of their costs is borne by the public system.
After a recent article in Time magazine replayed the differences, Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez wrote a letter arguing that the board's per-pupil costs were artificially inflated by the money it spends on Catholic schools. That includes funds for 30,000 daily lunches at 130 Catholic schools, for bus transportation for remedial reading and mathematics programs, all by acting as a conduit for Federal and state "pass through" funds.
 Nora Murphy, a spokesman for the archdiocesan schools, acknowledged that remedial, food and busing costs are not included in her schools' per-pupil average. But she argues that even if the archdiocese did count these costs there would still be a sharp discrepancy.
Scholars like Mr. Berne say that the contrast would still be tempered somewhat by understanding that roughly 20 percent of Catholic school teachers are nuns, priests and brothers paid stipends of about $15,000 and that lay teachers earn salaries ranging from $19,300 to $25,500. Public-school teachers, by comparison, start at $26,700 and earn as much as $52,750.
Public schools can't choose whom they educate. They must take all handicapped and troubled students, the most expensive because they require more teachers and counselors. New York spends $1.5 billion -- almost one quarter of its budget -- on 119,000 children classified as handicapped, though a majority may be lagging readers and behavior problems.

GRAPHIC: Graphs: "School spending as a proportion of city budgets" shows the percentage of New York City's budget allocated to elementary and secondary education as compared with other major cities in the state. "Methods of channeling funds to schools vary" shows the ways in which money for elementary and secondary education is raised in New York and how it compares with methods around the country.

Expensive Habits

BYLINE: BY PENELOPE GREEN

 BODY:
EVEN IF WE'RE IN THE THROES OF A RECESSION, THERE are still folks who may find it difficult to recede from habits ingrained during the last decade.
Not to worry, though. Those totems of conspicuous consumption -- cashmere, caviar, pearls, gold -- are now available in bottled form. For those who can no longer afford a $1,000 cashmere sweater set, there's always cashmere mascara, $13.50 from Christian Dior. If the gold market's got you down, Divinaura, a "beauty enhancer" from Guerlain, comes flecked with bits of gold at a mildly affordable $56 an ounce. Real gold, six milligrams of 24-karat gold in each bottle, enough to make a prospector sweat.
Here's how a few luxe-laced products match up with the pricey commodities from which they take their inspiration:
Guerlain Divinaura (remember, there are six milligrams of gold in there, a mini-lode that works nicely to make a knee or shoulder gleam): $56 for one ounce. One troy ounce of gold, roughly 31 grams, traded for $363 the other day. At $363 for 31 grams, six milligrams would set you back about 7 cents.
La Prairie Skin Caviar (O.K., it's not real caviar, just salmon-roe-sized beads of allantoin and other moisturizing elements. But still, "when the beads were submitted by our development team," says Aileen Rowland, chief operating officer of the company, "what did they look like? Caviar!"): $90 for two ounces. Beluga caviar at the Petrossian Boutique in Manhattan: $69.50 for one-sixteenth of an ounce.
Mascara Parfait from Christian Dior: Thickening Lash Care with Cashmere (real cashmere, and "it's great because no goats are killed," says Nancy Tessmer, advertising and public relations assistant at the company): $13.50. Short-sleeved cashmere T-shirt at Cashmere Cashmere in Manhattan: $275.
Hydra Perles Hydro-Protective Day Cream from Yves Saint Laurent (these aren't bona fide pearls, but "perfluorine pearls, silicone pearls and aqueous pearls"): $40 for one ounce. Thirty-inch single strands of cultured pearls at Mikimoto in Manhattan start at $1,500.
While I doubt that the cosmetics companies were thinking in these terms, the deployment of luxury goods as ingredients is a great gimmick -- one that conjures up all the ghosts of the 80's, but without any scary consequences. Still, if you're the sort that prefers to tough out tough times, perhaps the new men's cologne Recession (for "the man who used to have everything") is more the ticket. "The economy stinks," reads the legend on the package. "You shouldn't have to."

HEADLINE: A Persistent American Yearning

BYLINE: By James Reston; James Reston is the former executive editor and Washington columnist for The New York Times. This article is adapted from his memoir, "Deadline: Our Times and The New York Times," to be published in October by Random House.

 BODY:
THE LAST DECADE OF A CENTURY IS A TEMPTING TIME FOR PRESIDENTS, journalists, end-of-the-world preachers and other dreamers. Presidents in particular begin meditating on their place in history, and wondering how to make it look a little better than it was. George Washington made his famous farewell address in the last decade of the 18th century, and foresaw safety and prosperity for the new Republic in isolation from the quarrels of the world. In the last decade of the 19th century, President McKinley was not thinking of isolation (or of his sudden death soon to come), but was planning a new American empire and leading the country into the Spanish-American War. And at the beginning of the last decade of the 20th, George Herbert Walker Bush, the 41st President, was proclaiming the dawn of a "new world order," and starting it with a war against Iraq in the Middle East. 
 After studying the fortunetellers of the past, I admired their bravery more than their judgment. In the 1890's, the best of them were writing confidently about a future world of "inevitable progress." They were convinced that there was something in the nature of the universe, or maybe in the economics of supply and demand, or in the spread of knowledge and education that would surely lead to the Golden Age. By the time I arrived in Washington two world wars later, however, the pessimists had taken over, with books deploring "The Decline of the West" (Spengler), "The End of Our Time" (Berdyaev) and "The Fate of Homo Sapiens" (H. G. Wells).
All of their guesses were interesting, but most of them were wrong, for the world changed faster than they could change their minds. Some chalky genius, monkeying around in a laboratory or a garage, was always discovering how people could fly like birds, or send messages, pictures and even the music of Beethoven through space, or extract more food from the bounteous earth, or wipe out disease or go to the moon. These thinkers and tinkerers invented not only a better mousetrap but also a better mouse, named Mickey, who went into the movies and made children happy. They also developed new ways to kill more people, with atom bombs, but the human race just went on producing more children by the same delightful old-fashioned process anyway.
I admired the optimistic spirit behind President Bush's new world order, but I couldn't find much new in it other than his war in the Middle East. He vowed it would assure "for ourselves and for future generations" an Age of Peace, "where the rule of law, not the law of the jungle, governs the conduct of nations." I was all for George, but I thought this sounded very much like the pronouncements of other Presidents, particularly those of Woodrow Wilson, who thought not only that America could "change the world" but also that it had a moral duty to do so.
There was, I thought, something both wonderful and goofy about all this persistent American determination to reform the world. It reminded me of the little signs that used to hang in some of the service stores in Dayton, Ohio, when I was a boy. I forget the exact words, but they promised to do anything "possible" by tomorrow but conceded that the "impossible" might take a few days longer. This was the spirit that had conquered the American continent, survived the great economic depression of the 30's, helped restore Western Europe and Japan after World War II and survived the cold war with the Soviet Union for almost half a century.
But before you could say Saddam Hussein or even Yasir Arafat, President Bush had sent half a million Americans to the Middle East battlefield when Congress wasn't looking, and chased the Iraqis out of Kuwait in four days. It was a perfect American war: quick, flashy and all on television. More Americans were murdered at home during those four days than were killed in the war. President Bush called it, without undue modesty, the greatest military victory in the history of the Republic, and scarcely mentioned the 150,000 Iraqis who were slaughtered in the process.
Accordingly, I began to wonder about these wars to end war, and think that maybe old John Adams had a better idea. Adams said at the end of the 18th century that America should always try to help other nations in trouble, but he added that we should "go not abroad seeking monsters to destroy." In my years in the capital, however, we were finding monsters all over the world, not only big-league monsters in the Soviet Union and China but bush-league monsters in Korea, Vietnam, Cuba, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Panama, Iraq and various other places that didn't want our advice about freedom and democracy, or even know what the words meant.
No doubt the Iraq war served several useful purposes. It put future aggressors on notice that they could not assume American neutrality. It made clear that the United States regarded the oilfields of the Middle East as "vital" to its security and would not permit them to come under the control of any hostile power. It put an end to the self-doubts that had plagued the nation after its defeat in Vietnam, but this "Vietnam syndrome" was followed by a kind of "Iraq swagger" of boasting that Uncle Sam was No. 1 and would now at last redeem the optimistic visions of Woodrow Wilson and the other prophets of eternal peace.
My optimism didn't go quite that far. I thought the long nightmare of an atomic war was over for the foreseeable future, but I had more modest dreams. I didn't believe in new world orders that relied on fighting wars rather than deterring them, or in United Nations resolutions that "authorized" the United States to do most of the fighting. I believed in collective, not selective, security, and I thought we needed to ask ourselves some questions.
What areas were really "vital" to the security of the United States? Would our schools and slums be high on this list? When and how were we going to make the United States independent of Middle East oil and how? How could we have a new world order without cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union? When were these giants and the other industrial nations going to control or stop the shipment of advanced military weapons and materials for the production of nuclear, chemical and bacteriological explosives to the shaky gangster nations of the world? In short, where was the end-of-the-century threat to United States security anyway -- abroad or at home?
So every once in a while I mounted my old pulpit at The Times and suggested that the time had come, not for another new world order proclaimed, financed and policed by the United States and started with a war, but for a new American order beginning with a reappraisal of our commitments and resources and a reform of our priorities and decision-making procedures. I wasn't throwing off the disorder of the old world -- it made so much news! -- I just felt it could be improved with a little less fighting and a little more patience, common sense and diplomacy. I may have been wrong about this, but I didn't think it would hurt to review our commitments, keep them in line with our bank balances, pay our debts and prepare our children for the new problems of the coming century.
I thought I knew George Bush fairly well, but I didn't recognize his warrior pose. For years I had been longing for some Gentleman President to come along and set an example of calm thinking and honest talking, and I felt that George Bush was precisely that sort of man. The one I knew had promised "a kinder America" in "a gentler world," and I admired his record. His whole career seemed a preparation for the Presidency. He had more personal experience in Congress, business, military intelligence, war and diplomacy than any other President of my time. He was not an ideologue, having come out of the old Teddy Roosevelt-Col. Henry L. Stimson progressive nonpartisan tradition. I followed his career in the House of Representatives and at the United Nations. My wife, Sally, and I flew around with him during the 1980 Presidential campaign, when he was mocking Ronald Reagan's "voodoo" economics, and I felt sure he would bring a more pragmatic spirit to the White House.
In many ways, he did. On most things, he consulted the leaders of Congress. He abandoned his silly campaign promise of "no new taxes" (when he finally switched, he called the new taxes "revenue enhancement"). He tolerated dissent, and he held almost as many news conferences in his first year in the White House as Ronald Reagan did in the previous eight years. But something happened to him on his way to the White House. He campaigned like Richard Nixon and talked like Lyndon Johnson, saying publicly that Saddam Hussein was "worse than Hitler," and vowing publicly to "kick him in the ass." And when it was said that maybe he was a bit of a "wimp," he disproved it by wandering into two wars in his first two years in office.
He defied the principles of the United Nations when he went to war in Panama to get rid of a dictator named Noriega (again, the personal military approach to foreign policy), then relied on the United Nations principles when he went to war against Iraq, and defended the wars as moral contributions to good over evil.
More important, he talked about "the next American century," and said it was the purpose of the United States to insure the stability and security of the Middle East. "Among the nations of the world, only the United States of America has both the moral standing and the means to back it up," he said. "We are the only nation on this earth that could assemble the forces of peace."
The Republicans used to call this sort of thing "globaloney." Whatever it was, I thought it aroused excessive expectations that would be followed, as usual, by excessive disappointments. After all, most of the events that determined the history of this century -- the collapse of the old empires, the rise of Communism and Nazism, the Great Depression and the cold war -- were not foreseen. Nevertheless, President Bush presumed to talk confidently about his new world order for the next "American century."
There was no doubt that Saddam's brutal aggression deserved to be punished, but there were many places in the world where war might be morally justified but politically unwise. My fear was that this interventionist policy would eventually produce a negative reaction in the United States, weaken the Western alliance, revive the spirit of American isolationism and provoke racial tension among blacks, who made up a disproportionate percentage of the American ground forces.
His 100-hour ground war against Iraq, however, was highly popular. It was short and dramatic. The armed services demonstrated more military foresight and skill in waging the war than the civilian diplomats had shown in preventing it. And the American press decided that nothing short of an economic depression could keep President Bush from being re-elected in 1992.
I AVOIDED THIS GUESSING game, considering all my embarrassing predictions of the past. I thought George Bush was driving into a future he could not foresee, with one eye on the rear-view mirror and the other on the next election. He was, I believe, thinking like an old soldier about the foreign wars of the past, and not thinking much about the health of the nation, or even about the advice of his own doctors to give his fluttery heart a rest.
Before the Iraq war started, I wrote that saying "my President, right or wrong" was like saying "my driver, drunk or sober," but once the bombs started falling on Baghdad and Tel Aviv, the debate ended and the popularity of the President increased, as it did at the beginning of the Korean and Vietnam Wars. Accordingly, I worked on my own idea, not of a new world order, but of a new American order, which, in my imagination, would be planned in the last years of the 90's and put into operation with a fixed deadline of Jan. 1, 2000.
I found that, to my delight and to the despair of my younger friends, the older I got and the less information and energy I had, the more dogmatic I became. My wife greeted this with a melancholy sigh, but I went ahead anyway. The new American order of my imagination didn't contain anything that was not both reasonable and achievable. For example, it would have in place by the first day of the new century an energy program that didn't depend on the oil of the Middle East. I thought this was essential, even if we had to rely on the sun, the wind, atomic energy, taxes and horses. I didn't think this was ideal, but it seemed to me more realistic than counting on peace and sanity in the Middle East.
In my new American order, the world wouldn't be peopled by phantoms, and the objective would be to settle political disputes by negotiation, even with scoundrels, and not by proclaiming another "American century" with Uncle Sam as schoolmaster and chief of the world police. "Let George do it," I told myself, wasn't a policy but a line out of an old musical comedy, which I didn't think would be very popular when the bills came in.
By Deadline Jan. 1, 2000, under my dreamy scheme, both political parties would be in agreement (1) that the main threat to the nation's security came from within and not from abroad; (2) that a strong and modified defense force was essential, and (3) that even America's resources were limited, and should not be squandered on reluctant peoples who would rather fight than eat. I thought that clarity as well as charity begins at home, and therefore that we should cut our military guarantees to the essential minimum and reduce all moral posturing by Congressmen and columnists as much as possible under the First Amendment. (This would, of course, be denounced as the new isolationism, but I thought it was better to be denounced for avoiding unnecessary wars than for fighting them.)
Under my fantasy of a new American order, the two political parties would have an official smoke-filled room, preferably the old Supreme Court chamber in the Capitol, where candidates for the parties' nominations for the Presidency and Vice Presidency would be chosen by party leaders who knew something about character and ability to govern the country. The political parties would, before the election of 2004, I insisted, have abolished the present disgraceful system of campaign financing and arranged for at least six free television debates between the candidates (minus all reporters). They would not eliminate the state primary elections, but would retain the power to veto any turkey or quail proposed in these popularity contests.
On one wall of this smoke-filled room, there would be a portrait of Warren Gamaliel Harding to remind the pros not to make the same mistake again, and on another wall there would be a portrait of Teddy Roosevelt, preferably not on horseback, together with his favorite warning:
"The things that will destroy America are prosperity at any price, peace at any price, safety first instead of duty first, the love of soft living and the get-rich-quick theory of life. This country will not be a permanently good place for us to live unless it's a good place for all of us to live."
I had some other dandy, if not original, ideas: I thought it would help if Presidents and other leaders told the truth, and mentioned the word "sacrifice" once in a while. I didn't think we should amend the Constitution to conform to every popular whim of the day, or try to police the bedrooms of the American people. I thought it was unwise to corner dictators and other wild beasts, and since Presidents were not immortal, I favored Vice Presidents that were as reliable as a spare tire. I was for a longer school year because I was more interested in smart kids than "smart bombs," and I was for voluntary national service by young people to help in the overburdened, overexpensive hospitals, and for a national anthem that anybody could sing, drunk or sober.
Nobody listened to these fantasies, of course, but that's one of the nice things about being over 80: you don't care whether they listen, and even when they do, you can't quite hear what they say.

HEADLINE: More Young Single Men Hang Onto Apron Strings

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS

 BODY:
The rent is low and the utilities are free. There is hot food on the table and clean socks in the drawer. Mom nags a little and dad scowls a lot, but mostly they don't get in the way. And there's money left at the end of the month for the car payment.
Young, single men say these are the reasons they are living with their parents in record numbers, burrowing into the familial nest far more often than women of the same age and circumstance. 
 Facing tough economic times and marrying later, young people of both sexes have been living at home in growing numbers in recent years. But it is men, disproportionately, who are nesting with the folks, while women are more likely to live independently, alone or with roommates of either sex.
 
Nearly 1 of 3 at Home
 A recent Census Bureau survey of marital status and living arrangements shows men and women reacting very differently to the soft job market and soft marriage market. Among 25-to-34-year-olds, 32 percent of single men and 20 percent of single women were living with their parents last year.
There are few hard explanations for the wide disparity between men and women. Demographers speculate that men find living at home more attractive than women do because they are less skilled at setting up their own households, enjoy the pampering of their mothers and suffer virtually no loss of independence. Divorce rates are rising among parents, and mothers who would otherwise be living alone may value the protection and companionship of an adult son.
Until 1990, the Census Bureau did not specify marital status when tabulating those who lived at home in its annual survey of living arrangements. But demographers say they have every reason to believe the 1990 figures for single people are the highest ever.
And census figures for the total pool of young adults, married and single, show a dramatic shift in male behavior over the past two decades. In 1970, 9.5 percent of married and single men aged 25 to 34 lived with parents. By 1990 that was up to 15 percent. Among women, the two-decade rise was far more gradual, from 6.6 percent in 1970 to 8.1 percent last year.
 
Peter Pan, No Wendy
 The variation between men and women "suggests that the nest is a lot better feathered for the boys than the girls," said Frances Goldschieder, a professor of sociology at Brown University. Men are granted more freedom by their parents, Ms. Goldschieder and demographers say, and often get "a totally free ride" from their mothers on household chores.
The variation also suggests that "men need to be taken care of by women" and turn to their mothers in the absence of a wife, said Richard Hokenson, an economic demographer at the securities company Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. "It's a variation on the Peter Pan syndrome," Mr. Hokenson said. "You know, the Island of Lost Boys, the song 'I Won't Grow Up.' "
Among those at home with their parents are young men earning a good living, like Ed Mastoloni, a $35,000-a-year financial analyst for a New York City insurance company. Some are unemployed and others are barely getting by.
But rich or poor, they seem to enjoy the same comforts.
"I come and go as I please, and dinner's always ready when I get home," said Mr. Mastoloni, 25 years old, who lives in his family's sprawling home in Greenwich, Conn. Mr. Mastoloni says that he would be earning enough to move out if he had not recently bought an expensive jeep and a jet ski.
 
Pampering Doesn't Stop
 Jeff Seaman, a 27-year-old deputy sheriff in Cincinnati who makes $19,000 a year, also reaps the rewards of tender loving care and low overhead. "Everything's always done -- the laundry, the food -- and I don't have to worry about the cable getting shut off or the telephone," he said. "Where I used to live, there might be beer cans and pizza boxes stacked up for weeks. And I drive a Corvette, not a rusted-out Ford Escort."
The Seaman household also includes Jeff's 30-year-old brother, Doug, a health care aide who has custody of his two sons. Donna Seaman, a nurse, looks after them all, as well as her husband, Willis, who is a welder, and she muses about the ways women spoil men.
"I think us women have got to do something about these boys," Mrs. Seaman said. "It's all our own fault. All we do is wait on them."
The pampering takes many forms. Betty Sansing of San Rafael, Calif., gets up early to pack a lunch for her 32-year-old son, John, a sheet metal worker. Louise Specht of Aliquippa, Pa., does laundry for her 31-year-old son, Brian, an unemployed plumber, because she doesn't want him "puttering around with my washer." Judy Mastoloni, Ed's mother, irons her son's shirts for $1 each and takes his shoes to the shoemaker for nothing.
 
When Her Career Is Kids
 Most of the sons rave about how nice it is to live in a clean house. "Men are, you could say, lazy," Mr. Mastoloni said. "They know there's stuff to clean up, but they watch football instead. And how often does a guy get down on his hands and knees to scrub the bathtub?"
Mrs. Sansing, Mrs. Specht and Mrs. Mastoloni do not work outside the home, and demographic experts suggest that nonworking women are most likely to enjoy having their grown sons at home.
"If their career was kids, it's a justification of their choice of role," said Celinda Lake, vice president of Greenberg/Lake, a Washington polling organization.
Many fathers seem to object to the imposition on their wives more than their wives themselves do. One of them, a San Francisco garbageman, has two sons at home, aged 25 and 28. One was recently laid off as a house painter, and the other has a drug problem. Both take advantage of their mother, the man said.
"All they have to say is 'Mom, I need a six-pack, $20 and the keys to the car,' and she's off and running," he said.
 
In Return, Muscle, Maybe Rent
 When a son lives with a divorced mother, the divison of labor seems more equitable. Eva Farris, an employment counselor in Houston, shares her home with her 25-year-old son, Mike, an auto mechanic. He pays her $200 a month -- apparently the standard amount when rent is paid -- and also does her yard work and car repair.
"Plus I run off her boyfriends on occasion," Mr. Farris said.
Some demographers speculate that the increase in sons at home is related to the rising incidence of divorce. With no father in residence, these experts say, the tension between the parent and child of the same sex is missing and the mother enjoys the benefits of a man around the house. "Then it's a two-way relationship," said Martha Farnsworth Riche, the director of policy studies at the Population Reference Bureau in Washington.
Many young men said that low household costs enabled them to buy the "toys" that meant so much to them. The garbageman, who spoke on condition that he not be named, complained that his son recently bought "a Chevy muscle car instead of a four-cylinder Honda" and "now he's choking on the payments."
Mr. Hokenson, the economic demographer, spoke disapprovingly of "kids who would rather finance a better life style than pay housing expenses." But Ms. Lake notes that this generation of young adults is the first in history who will not do as well as their parents, which she describes as "a fundamental violation of the American dream."
One widely cited reason boys stay home more often than girls is that their parents grant them the freedom to stay out late and conduct sexual relationships. "With my girls, I didn't really sleep soundly till I knew they were in," said Mrs. Sansing. "With boys, it's different."
The rules vary from house to house. In the Blaustein home in Skokie, Ill., where 25-year-old twin sons are living after graduate school while they look for work, there are no clear rules but lots of leeway. "My parents go to bed without asking, 'Where is this girl staying?' so they're tacitly allowing it," said Jeremy Blaustein, who has a master's degree in Asian studies. "It would probably be different if I were a girl."
But dating poses a different sort of problem for these young men, several of whom said they were embarrassed to tell women that they lived with their parents. "It's not something I'm proud of," said Mr. Mastoloni. "When a girl asks, I shy away from it or lie."
 
Occasionally, Fathers Erupt
 Some of the fathers deal with their live-in sons with sullen silence and an occasional explosion. Herman Specht, the supervisor of a zinc smelter, is one of these, angry at his unemployed son, who came home when his marriage broke up.
"He can't keep a job and he can't keep a wife," Mr. Specht grumbled. "The only thing he can keep is his mother and father."
At that, Mrs. Specht said: "It doesn't bother me like it bothers him. I'm already cooking supper, so it's no big deal. My husband thinks back to what he was doing at that age. He doesn't understand that the economy today isn't what it was then."
The San Francisco garbageman said it infuriates him to come home "dead tired" from a midnight shift and find his sons lying around the house. If they can't find the $18 an hour construction jobs they want, he said, they should "wash dishes and deliver newspapers."
Several parents said they had strategies for ousting their sons if they didn't move in due time. Ms. Farris said she would gradually prepare Mike for the fact that it was time to leave the nest, then help him find an apartment, give him the money for first month's rent and security, and accompany him to sign the lease.
"If they can't do it themselves, you do it for them," she said.
The San Francisco garbageman has another idea. He intends to put up with his sons for until next year, when he turns 55 and is entitled to a one-time waiver of the capital gains tax if he sells his house.
"Kids today, they want to retire with you," he said. "But I've had it. We're going to move to a place that's too small for them."

A front-page chart last Sunday with an article about adults who live with their parents misstated a figure for 25-to-34-year-old women. According to a 1990 Census Bureau survey of living arrangements, 8.1 percent of all women in that age group live with parents, not 9.5 percent.

HEADLINE: Southwest Air's New Push West

BYLINE: By PETER C. T. ELSWORTH

DATELINE: DALLAS

 BODY:
The airline industry is only slowly emerging from one of its worst recessions ever, but Southwest Airlines has come through the storm almost intact and with its ambitions undiminished. One of the only leading airlines to report an operating profit last year, the Dallas-based carrier is expediting its push into California and using its tested recipe for growth: short flights, low fares, frequent service, moderate debt and the inspired lunacy of its chief executive, Herbert D. Kelleher.
Southwest has little choice but to look west because there is little room to expand in Texas, where it serves 10 airports, and in adjoining states. "They need a market to grow," said Jessica C. Tully, an analyst with Eppler, Guerin & Turner in Dallas. "Their main thing was Phoenix a few years ago. Now it's California." 
 In addition, the carrier is facing the possibility of future competition from a high-speed train on its bread-and-butter run between Dallas and Houston. Texas officials agreed to a plan earlier this month, but it is by no means certain that the project, which could cost as much as $7 billion, will ever be built.
"It's the only airline that appears to be making any money at the moment," said Paul Turk, an analyst at Avmark, an air-travel consulting company in Washington. Compared with other carriers, "it's a completely different beast, flying small planes over secondary routes."
Tomorrow, the carrier will raise the number of cities it serves in California to seven when it inaugurates flights from Sacramento, and it has already increased its service in California by about 30 percent this year. It has been flying into California since 1982 but is only now concentrating on the lucrative north-south market.
Analysts argue the carrier is already the leading intrastate carrier in certain key California markets despite the heavy competition from United Airlines, which dominates the key Los Angeles-San Francisco run.
"California is a natural extension, a perfect market for them and their No. 1 growth opportunity," said Glenn D. Engel, who follows the airline industry for Goldman Sachs.
"We are making money in California," said Mr. Kelleher as he strode around his office during a recent interview, gesturing with an ever-present cigarette. He noted the load factor, or percentage of seats filled, for the carrier's California operations was 61.6 percent in May, comfortably above the break-even level of 55 or 56 percent.
Still, Southwest is in for a prolonged struggle for passengers in California, analysts say. "The competition is very high, not so much because of money but because it's an important market to the big players, who regard it as a loss leader needed to feed frequent-flyer clients," Mr. Engel said. "It's important to be in a highly visible market."
Ms. Tully said, "There is too much capacity in California," adding, "Southwest will be victorious and make money but to really make money -- big profits -- someone else will have to cut back."
Mr. Kelleher said that although Southwest has no intention of stepping on United's toes by competing in the Los Angeles-San Francisco run, opting to concentrate on the alternative Burbank-Oakland route, he fully intends to make it the dominant short-haul carrier in the state.
"We are very well equipped to fight the war," Mr. Kelleher said, citing the company's strong balance sheet. According to Edward J. Starkman, airline analyst with PaineWebber, Southwest's debt-to-total-capital ratio was 32 percent at the end of the first quarter, compared with 45 percent for American and 36 percent for Delta, although United's was a lean 30 percent at the end of 1990.
USAIR Group, based in Arlington, Va., which acquired the West Coast carrier PSAir in 1987, has already cut back its service in California as part of a restructuring, the company says. "USAir has been pulling down a lot of former PSAir routes," said Mr. Kelleher. "For whatever reasons, they are doing it, and it's falling into our laps. On May 2 they ceased service to six cities, and we've had to move as fast as we can."
Mr. Starkman attributes USAir's move to Southwest's competitive edge. "That's 80 percent of the reasoning," he said. "Southwest's low fares are not promotional. These are the fares that will be there." USAir concedes that it is difficult to compete with Southwest's low ticket prices.
Southwest ranks 10th among United States carriers with about 3 percent of the domestic air travel market, according to Avmark. Now flying to 32 cities in 14 states, the carrier has built its fortunes on frequent, short-haul flights -- an ideal system for intrastate travel. "It's remarkable that with all the glitter of deregulation, Southwest has the most disciplined growth of all the entrants -- 10 to 20 percent a year," Mr. Engel said.
Within Texas, where it advertises itself as "the company plane," Southwest has regular service to 10 cities, including 83 daily flights between Dallas and Houston. It also flies to all the surrounding states, under a Federal law that limits nonstop flights from its home base, the Dallas municipal airport, Love Field, to the four states bordering Texas. The law, known as the Wright Amendment, was enacted in 1979 to allow Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport to become the region's long-haul airport. To fly beyond neighboring states from Love Field, Southwest must touch down somewhere en route.
Although Southwest fought the Wright Amendment, Mr. Kelleher concedes that it has made Love Field undesirable to other airlines and that he now has a monopoly there.
There have been moves to repeal the law, especially by Kansas politicians who claim that air service to Texas is more expensive than it need be, but Mr. Starkman believes such a move is unlikely and would have a minimal effect on Southwest.
"Southwest runs differently from everyone else," Mr. Engel said. All other leading carriers fly long-range passengers into hubs, load them onto one plane and fly them on. "The hub-and-spoke system is an efficient way to fill a plane but not an efficient way to use a plane," he said. "Southwest flies point to point, back and forth. It's a more efficient use of the plane, but it's harder to fill the plane."
But filling the plane is not as vital for Southwest because it cuts costs by flying short routes, which allows it to do without full meal service; by keeping the average turnaround time to an astonishing 15 minutes for most flights, thus keeping its planes in the air, earning money; and by using only Boeing 737's, which keeps maintenance and training costs to a minimum for the fleet of 114 planes.
In addition, the airline is known for its high productivity, which analysts attribute to a dedicated work force of about 9,000, inspired by Mr. Kelleher's antics and workaholic habits. More than half of the company's employees belong to national unions. "Southwest does not need as much revenues to make money because their costs are 50 percent less," Mr. Engel said. Southwest managed to keep its losses to a minimum in the recent downturn. While the industry lost about $4 billion last year when it was hit by a combination of the recession, skyrocketing fuel prices and a dropoff of demand as Americans opted to stay home during the crisis in the Middle East, Southwest reported a profit of $47.1 million.
In the first quarter of 1991, however, the company reported a loss of $8.2 million after a loss of $4.6 million in the fourth quarter last year. They were the first consecutive quarterly losses in the company's history.
"Compared to the others, I'm not too disappointed," Mr. Kelleher said. "$12.8 million is a small percentage of an industry loss of $3.3 billion" in the two most-recent quarters, he said, adding that he expects the company to be profitable in the second quarter, "but not as much as last year."
 
 
 
NOT JUST ANOTHER ELVIS IMPERSONATOR
 From the moment some 20 years ago when the idea for Southwest Airlines was first sketched on a restaurant napkin -- a triangle with three dots representing Dallas, Houston and San Antonio -- the personality of Herbert Kelleher has dominated the company.
For a chief executive of a billion dollar corporation, Mr. Kelleher is one of a kind. His antics have included dressing up as Elvis Presley and the Easter Bunny, delivering rap songs and serving as a flight attendant, ticket collector and baggage handler.
To publicize the carrier's new service in and out of Sacramento, for example, he sang a rap song accompanied by two people dressed as tomatoes and two as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
All this has earned the company not only a great deal of publicity but also staff loyalty so intense that Wall Street analysts cite high productivity as a key element in the company's success. The carrier hires only one person out of 10 who apply, and those who join the company are made to feel like part of a family. The halls of the company's new headquarters next to Love Field in Dallas are lined with thousands of photographs celebrating one Southwest party after another. Herb, as he is universally known, is usually at the center of the picture.
"There's no question that the glory of Southwest Airlines is its productivity," said Edward J. Starkman, airline analyst with PaineWebber. "The work force is dedicated to the company. They're Moonies basically. That's the way they operate."
Mr. Kelleher, who was raised in the Northeast, had no background experience to start an airline other than his training as a lawyer and his marriage into a San Antonio family.
The downside to the intensity of the 60-year-old Mr. Kelleher's involvement is the question of how the company would fare without him. It is not reassuring that he smokes five packs of cigarettes a day. "It's a concern, certainly, because there is no clear successor in line, but I don't want to overplay it," said Mr. Starkman. "This is a very strong company."

HEADLINE: Graduates Find Road to Jobs Longer and More Difficult

BYLINE: By LINDA SASLOW

 BODY:
LAST week, a month after graduating from Dowling College in Oakdale, James Kowalski of West Sayville began working, at a salary of almost $30,000 a year, as an associate programmer analyst for Spectrum Healthcare Solutions in Hauppauge.
Mr. Kowalski has a bachelor's degree, with a major in computer-information systems. As a participant in the Dowling cooperative-education program since his junior year, he was an intern at Spectrum, receiving $10 an hour for his part-time work. 
"I knew I wanted to stay on full time after I graduated," Mr. Kowalski said. "I took over as many tasks as I could to show the director that I was interested and motivated. If I hadn't had my foot in the door, I probably wouldn't have found a job and might not have been able to stay on Long Island."
Many of Mr. Kowalski's friends with business degrees have gone for job interviews that have not panned out, he said. As a result, they are now living at home with their parents, working part time, waiting and hoping.
Conversely, whereas a majority of college graduates a generation ago found entry-level jobs and took their own apartments, this year's graduates on the Island are more likely to be living at home with their families, expecting to wait as long as a year before finding jobs.
Because of the depressed job market, even then there may not be openings in certain fields.
Giancarlo Marchesi, who graduated this year from the Hofstra Business School, is, like Mr. Kowalski, another fortunate job candidate. At the end of the month, he will commute from his parents' home in Westbury to Citicorp in Melville, where he was hired as a management associate at a starting salary of $30,000.
Knowing how competitive the market is, Mr. Marchesi prepared carefully for each interview, he said, including extensive research about each company.
"I went through about seven interviews," he said. "It was pretty depressing and didn't look very promising. Of my friends who graduated with me, I'm one of the few who was lucky and got a job."
The mood among recent graduates is split, Mr. Marchesi said.
"Since the recession started last year, we were ready for this and knew how tough it would be," he said. "Half of my friends have become more aggressive in their job search, and the other half are resigned but optimistic. Within a year, they think they'll find jobs."
The job outlook for graduates is mixed. The consensus among university officials is that there are fewer companies recruiting on campuses and fewer jobs available. But, they say, there are still openings.
Traditionally, three months after receiving their degrees, 95 percent of C. W. Post graduates have found full-time positions, said the director of the Career Placement Center at the college, Mince Kohler. That may be a bit longer this year, she said, and candidates are more likely to take the first offer.
The average time for finding a job, most university officials say, is seven to eight months at salaries of about $25,000.
"This is a fragmented and selective labor market that is more difficult to navigate than in previous years," the regional Commissioner of Labor Statistics, Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, said. "It tests the capacity of adapting to a rapidly moving situation, and depends on what skills a candidate brings to the labor market and how flexible he is in adapting those skills to the market.
"Applicants may have to adjust their horizons. They may not get the exact job, in the exact field, at the pay or location that they had their hearts set on. We're talking about flexibility, but even in this difficult market, there still is hiring taking place."
Colleges do not conduct most follow-up surveys until at least six months after commencements. But a spokeswoman for the Long Island Association, Valerie Scibilia, said there was a general feeling that although there were some openings on the Island, an overwhelming number of people was applying for them.
The demand seems greater for higher-level positions, she said, adding that entry jobs may be slightly more available.
A majority of graduates are staying on the Island, said the director of career services at Adelphi University, Ann Robinson. Most graduates are living at home with their families, she added, working part time while continuing job searches.
 
Teaching Market Gloomy
 In teaching, which is suffering one of its worst markets on the Island in many years, candidates are more willing to relocate, Ms. Robinson said. The tightest markets are in the Northeast and Far West, she said.
Graduates willing to look for jobs throughout the country increase their chances 1,000-fold, said the career counselor at the State University at Stony Brook, Peter Burke.
"But kids from Long Island generally want to stay here," he said. "They even look at New York City as a foreign land. But after confronting reality, many slowly start to open up their horizons."
Among the fields cited as having few opportunities are banking, education and engineering.
Many of the fields have cycles, Mr. Burke said, adding:
"But there are no dead-end fields. A job search largely depends upon a candidate's motivation and perseverance. If someone wants something enough, he'll get it."
At Hofstra, there was a 10 percent increase this year of students using placement services, said the vice president of student services, Peter Fishbein.
 
Co-op Education Programs on Rise
 At some colleges, cooperative-education programs have grown. The programs combine academics and work.
The colleges having co-op programs include Dowling, Polytechnic University, the Long Island University campuses at C. W. Post and Southampton and Suffolk Community.
This year, 350 Post interns had pre-employment positions, the director of cooperative education, Marcy Smelkinson, said. She added that, after graduation, 45 to 80 percent stayed with the companies.
The interns' average salary is $7.10 an hour. Ms. Smelkinson said co-op students tended to find jobs faster and to earn more than graduates without experience.
 
Dowling Interns Average $7.50
 The average salary for a Dowling intern is $7.50 an hour, the program coordinator, Michael J. Mooney, said. For those staying with the companies, salaries after graduation are usually $2,000 to $3,000 higher than for applicants with no experience.
Of the 53 Dowling graduates in the co-op program, 30 have been accepted for permanent employment at the workplaces, Mr. Mooney said. More than 70 companies had agreements with 111 students.
Graduates in the health fields face especially good prospects, Mr. Ehrenhalt said. That industry, he added, is one of few expanding in the New York metropolitan region.
 
Opportunities in Nursing
 In nursing, starting salaries have risen, from about $25,000 to $35,000, Ms. Robinson said, adding that there were also openings in health-related careers like physical and rehabilitative therapy.
Computer work, particularly setting up systems with software, is a strong field, Ms. Kohler said. Another possible field is marine science, including biology, chemistry and environmental sciences, said the director of career development at L.I.U.-Southampaton, John McCrudden. "Environmental issues are a hotbed today," he said. "And there are considerable opportunities on all levels in environmental consulting firms, research facilities and state and local agencies."
Last year, 76 percent of the graduates from L.I.U.-Southampton found employment in six months, Mr. McCrudden said. But business graduates, he said, are finding it harder to obtain jobs.
At Five Towns College in Seaford, 60 percent of the graduates specialized in music, a profession that has shown slight growth, said the vice president of the college, Martin Cohen. "Entertainment is one area in which, even in a recession, people are still spending money," he said.
Students have found work repairing instruments, recording and other areas, Mr. Cohen said. The performing-arts market is holding nationally, he added, but is down regionally.
The mood is generally optimistic among the graduates, and it is an exciting time for them, said Mr. Fishbein.
"They read the papers and know that the economy is tough," he said. "But it just makes them a bit more determined and aggressive. Instead of interviewing with two or three companies, they may see four or five. And even the interviewing experience is an important one."
College graduates do not face the bleak prospects that high school drop-outs do, Mr. Ehrenhalt said. "These youngsters will get placed," he said. "If they approach the job market creatively and with flexibility, they'll do all right."

HEADLINE: NATIONAL NOTEBOOK: Mountain View, Calif.;
A Civic Center For a Revival

BYLINE: By MORRIS NEWMAN

 BODY:
A $44.5 MILLION civic center resembling an Italian piazza and part of an effort to bring business and office tenants to this city 30 miles south of San Francisco has opened.
The complex, which was completed in April, includes a 77,000-square-foot City Hall and a 46,000-square-foot community theater that arc around a 30,000-square-foot courtyard opening onto Castro Street, the main commercial strip. 
 At the center of the courtyard, a pair of slender octagonal buildings, one of them a seven-story entrance to City Hall, are intended to serve as an "urban gateway" connecting Castro Street and Pioneer Park to the west. An underground parking garage for 240 cars lies beneath the civic center.
The three-story bulk of the City Hall and theater complex, accented by the two taller structures, stands beside a 10-story concrete office building from the 1960's. The architect, William Turnbull of San Francisco, said that to overcome the incongruity in scale, he attempted to break the dominance of the high-rise by "putting public space at its feet."
The new civic center replaces a demolished city hall on the same site. The older building was undergoing earthquake reinforcement several years ago when workers discovered that it was structurally unsound. The design for the new complex was selected in 1986 after a competition.
Early versions of the plan presented the same buildings in simpler in form, but city officials asked for more ornate detailing and brighter colors. The final plan features salmon-colored walls and a gray-green tile roof. Mr. Turnbull, expressing some reservations about the outcome, said, "It's a little too post-mod for us."
The civic center is part of a far-reaching plan by local officials to revitalize the downtown. In recent years, this city of 67,000 people has been a bedroom community for the larger cities of Silicon Valley.
Now, it is actively promoting development, including downtown office and residential construction. Currently, $140 million worth of construction is either planned or under way, said Ken Alsman, the city's economic development director.
Redevelopment, however, has not come cheaply. The civic center ran about $15.5 million over its budget. The city also spent $12 million to redesign the traffic patterns on Castro Street.
City officials acknowledge that the redevelopment has strained the city's budget, but Mr. Alsman said the civic center was worth it. "My sense is, in the long run, this kind of presence in the community will be to its long-term financial benefit," he said.

HEADLINE: No Pain, No Gain -- or How New York Can Resolve This Crisis and Avert Another;
ALBANY-CITY SWAP

BYLINE: By Charles Brecher and Raymond D. Horton; Charles Brecher, who teaches at New York University, and Raymond D. Horton, who teaches at Columbia, are, respectively, research director and president of the Citizens Budget Commission.

 BODY:
In whatever shape New York City survives this financial crisis, another siege is only a matter of time if there are no fundamental changes in how the city gets and spends its money. Most such structural reforms have been considered politically unthinkable -- until now. The Op-Ed page asked several specialists for ways that fiscal necessity could be the mother of municipal invention.
The "two New Yorks" are headed for bankruptcy. Continuing their current policies would, in the next four years, produce cumulative deficits of $13 billion for the state and $16 billion for the city. 
 A partial "solution" only aggravates the problem. To reduce their deficits, state and city officials pursue beggar-thy-neighbor policies. To balance his budget, Gov. Mario Cuomo cut about $400 million in aid for New York City. Mayor David Dinkins, facing a $3.5 billion deficit, is seeking more state aid.
A better approach would reflect the common interests of the two New Yorks. One such change would rearrange the relationship between the state's taxing authority and major mandated costs shouldered by localities.
New York localities carry an unusually heavy load of public service financing, primarily because Albany requires them to contribute substantially to welfare and Medicaid programs. Of the 50 state governments, New York's requires the largest local contribution.
In 1990, the statewide cost of welfare and Medicaid exceeded $14.7 billion; about $5.2 billion was paid for by state taxes, about $3.3 billion by local taxes and the rest by the Federal Government.
State assumption of local welfare and Medicaid costs would pave the way for tax reforms beneficial to the state as well as to its localities. It would require the city to give up approximately $2.2 billion in local taxes committed to meeting welfare and Medicaid mandates. It would also permit the city to drop the two taxes identified as most harmful to the local economy -- the unincorporated-business tax and the commercial rent tax -- and still have substantial sums left for further tax cuts and closing short-run budget gaps.
This swap would be good for the state as well as the city. Nearly half of the state's revenues are derived from the New York City economy. By placing heavier tax burdens on localities like New York City, which has a large number of poor residents, state policy creates incentives for businesses to relocate to places that have fewer poor residents.
This swap would require new statewide taxes to pay for the state's added welfare and Medicaid responsibilities. The most sensible new source of state revenue would be higher personal income tax rates. The personal income tax is broad-based, progressive, federally deductible, and would yield large sums with small rate increases. The result would be a more efficient and equitable system of financing government across the state.

HEADLINE: The Executive Life;
An Upscale Gallic Grab for the American Wallet

BYLINE: By Nancy Marx Better

 BODY:
"It is a joy when you are able to tell the difference between a Chateau d'Yquem and an ordinary burgundy." So said Jean-Louis Dumas-Hermes, fifth-generation head of the Paris-based fashion house that bears his name. Mr. Dumas-Hermes was breakfasting at the Mayfair Regent in New York with two colleagues from the Comite Colbert, an association of France's leading luxury goods manufacturers, plus a few upscale providers of services.
Nattily attired in French-cuffed shirts and Hermes ties, the gentlemen were discussing American sartorial style. It is a subject with which Mr. Dumas-Hermes first became familiar some years ago, during a brief stint as an assistant buyer at Bloomingdale's. 
 "Today, we find that executives don't want to show off so much," Mr. Dumas-Hermes said. "They want to have a certain elegance. But they don't want to wear things that people can recognize from 20 yards away."
These are trying times for haberdashers like Hermes, makers of $95 ties, $2,000 attache cases and other business accessories with definite, but discreet, long-distance recognition factors. In a leaner America, visible status symbols are on the wane.
As one New Yorker, Alan Millstein, explained, "This fancy European merchandise appealed to parvenus." Now, added Mr. Millstein, a retail consultant, "the money is gone, and so are the customers. People are going back to basics."
Managers from the Comite Colbert's 70 member companies -- Chateau d'Yquem, the premiere sauternes producer, belongs, of course; ordinary red wine, whatever the provenance, does not make the cut -- convened in early June for their annual international summit. There was a black-tie gala at the Central Park Boathouse for advertising, marketing and publishing executives and a Champagne street festival celebrating "l'art de vivre," the art of living. The goal: to woo Americans, who represent 14 percent of the Comite Colbert's worldwide sales.
"It's important for successful people to appreciate fine quality," said Mr. Dumas-Hermes, speaking with the authority of one whose great-great-grandfather began the family business as a saddle maker in 1837. "It's what sets executives apart, the ability to discern." He added, "Of course, price is a concern. You can't sell a tie for $1,000."
While Mr. Dumas-Hermes admits the recession and the weak dollar have dampened American demand for top-of-the-line imported goods, he won't reveal specific statistics. (Neither will most of the other Comite Colbert companies; privately held, they need not and do not release financial information.) "Sure, it's a bit difficult to operate in this economy," he said. "It's a challenge, because we're under pressure to make things that are cheaper, to develop a mass-market attitude."
But the group intends to retain the standards set by Jean-Jacques Guerlain, the parfumeur, when he founded the Comite in 1954, borrowing the name of Jean Baptiste Colbert, a statesman and supporter of artisans in the court of Louis XIV. No member's products may be entirely machine-made or distributed in abundance. "We're not switching our strategy because Wall Street is up or down," Mr. Dumas-Hermes said.
The Comite has noted a shift in American tastes. "In the 1980's, Americans were impressed by the logo on a product," said Alain Boucheron, head of Boucheron jewelers, who will succeed Mr. Dumas-Hermes as chairman of the group next month. "Now they're impressed by craftsmanship."
Indeed, said Mr. Millstein, Americans have eschewed items with initials for some time. "They don't want to be seen carrying a briefcase with a logo stamped all over it. They want to whisper, not shout." (Yes, Louis Vuitton, Yves Saint Laurent and Chanel are Comite members, but all have aggressively protected the exclusivity of their images, rather than flaunting them like Gucci. The famed Hermes logo is artfully woven into the design, not imposed upon it.)
Mr. Boucheron believes executives are becoming more sophisticated. "It used to be that you had to buy something from a certain company, even if you didn't really like it, because it made you feel important," he said. "Today, you buy something because it gives you pleasure."
Still, Mr. Dumas-Hermes is waiting for Americans to develop a "signature," or personal style, like their European brethren."To be frank," he said, "I find there is an awful lot of uniformity in executive dress here. There are only a few things that make a difference, like the tie, the shirt, the shoes. These things should be in harmony with your character, to express who you are."
In an educational effort, the Comite Colbert recently launched an internship program for American students of management and design. This summer, a student from the Harvard Business School will work for Hermes, analyzing the company's international structure. A student from the Fashion Institute of Technology will help create accessories at Nina Ricci. A student from Columbia's Graduate School of Business will develop an international pricing strategy for Puiforcat, fine silver. A student from the Parsons School of Design will apprentice as a Baccarat candlestick maker. All will receive free passage on Air France (the Concorde) and free lodging at member hotels, which include the Plaza Athenee, Ritz and Crillon.
"We don't care if the students ultimately go into these businesses or not," said Christian Blanckaert, the group's president and a former director of the French Government's tourism office. "In fact, we wish they wouldn't. What we want is that 20 years from now, a handful of top executives in America will remember the summer they spent in France, and what they learned about l'art de vivre."

HEADLINE: Ethiopians in Israel Get Equal Treatment

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your June 6 report "200 Ethiopians Trapped in West Bank" implies that these immigrants from the 1984 airlift are being denied choices in housing and employment, being forced to hold menial jobs far from home. 
 Yes, Ethiopian immigrants to Israel in 1984 were sent to Kiryat Arba, as well as many other cities. Kiryat Arba is a small, residential town in the West Bank, which houses primarily Israelis, many of whom work in Israel proper. Their daily commute is a fact of life. Israel's economy allows people to pursue education and jobs as they wish.
The Ethiopians living in Kiryat Arba are in the same boat as the other Israelis. Although many of them hold menial jobs or are unemployed, others have become professionals who have had a positive impact on their communities and Israel as a whole. As they progress up the economic ladder, they can use their new resources to make life style changes as they see fit.
Is it a government's responsibility to move residents to more comfortable public housing or to encourage them to be part of the economic mainstream and enable them to move themselves?

HEADLINE: Big Order Expected By Airbus

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, June 16

 BODY:
Airbus Industrie plans to announce this week that the Federal Express Corporation, the express airfreight carrier, will order up to 75 new cargo planes from Airbus in a $6 billion deal, officials from the European aircraft consortium said.
The deal, which is set to be announced at the Paris Air Show in the next few days, will be one of Airbus's biggest successes in the American market, which has long been dominated by Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. The order will also be the consortium's largest ever for cargo aircraft. 
 In winning the Federal Express order, Airbus has bested an offer from the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which, along with the Boeing Company, has frequently complained that Airbus receives government subsidies that give it an unfair competitive advantage. The American market has been the biggest challenge for Airbus, which rejects the charges of unfair subsidies.
 
'Blow for McDonnell'
 "This is a real blow for McDonnell Douglas," an industry analyst said at the Paris show.
According to Airbus officials, Federal Express is placing firm orders for 25 A-300 wide-body twin-engine aircraft and is taking out options on 50 other A-300's. The Airbus A-300 won in a competition against McDonnell Douglas MD-11 cargo planes, the Airbus officials said.
The Airbus planes, which are scheduled to be delivered over 15 years beginning in 1993, will replace for the most part Federal Express's Boeing 727's and McDonnell Douglas DC-10's.
An Airbus official said that on many routes to and from Federal Express's hub in Memphis, a single A-300 could replace two Boeing 727's now serving the route. The Airbus official said: "This makes economic sense for Federal Express. They can use one aircraft with two pilots and two engines instead of two 727's with a total of six pilots and six engines."
Airbus officials said final papers for the deal were not yet signed, but they said Federal Express officials were coming to Paris this week for a news conference about the order.
The Federal Express order is by far the largest announced at this year's Paris Air Show, the world's largest air show. This year the show has a downbeat mood. Civil aircraft orders are down because of airline financial troubles resulting from a plunge in air traffic during the Persian Gulf crisis. Military aircraft orders are also down because of the end of the cold war and cuts in military budgets.
On Thursday, Boeing announced orders, totaling $2.74 billion, for 41 aircraft from four buyers: American Airlines, Delta Air Lines Inc., Lufthansa A.G., and GPA Group P.L.C., an Irish airplane leasing company.
Airbus, which delivered 165 aircraft last year, expects revenues of $7.4 billion this year, up from $4.7 billion in 1990.
Airbus's victory in the Federal Express order is just one of several ways in which Airbus has squared off against its American archrivals at the Paris show.
Jean Pierson, Airbus's managing director, said his company was talking to several airlines to see whether they would be interested in a 650-seat aircraft. With airports more congested than ever, Mr. Pierson suggested that airlines might be looking for aircraft even larger than Boeing's 747, whose typical layout holds around 400 passengers.
Airbus officials said they hoped such a plane would be ready in about 10 years, when a large number of 747's are expected to be retired from service.
At the show, Philip M. Condit, a Boeing executive vice president, said his company was also talking to airlines about developing a plane larger than the 747. He said Boeing would consider a stretched version of the 747, a double-deck version the whole length of the plane, or a completely new design.
Mr. Pierson also said Airbus was studying development of a 130-seat aircraft to compete against Boeing's 737-300. Airbus's commercial director boasted that the aircraft, which would be a shortened version of the 150-seat A-320, would capture more than 50 percent of the market against the 737-300's. Airbus officials said that if they decided to go ahead with this new aircraft, which would be called the A-319, it would cost about $400 million to develop, or one-tenth the cost of an all-new design.
Airbus's partners are Aerospatiale of France and Deutsche Airbus of Germany, each of which holds a 37.9 percent stake, British Aerospace P.L.C., which has a 20 percent share, and CASA of Spain, with 4.2 percent.

HEADLINE: Dirt Roads: Deep Ruts, High Cost, but Status

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NORTH SALEM, N.Y.

 BODY:
In the beginning, there were dirt roads. In spring, tires got stuck in the mud; in summer, a film of dirt dulled shiny cars. Then there were paved roads, an indisputable sign of progress. Right?
Wrong. Across northern Westchester County and in neighboring Putnam County, dirt road devotees argue that it is worthwhile to save a disappearing network of back roads that evoke the bucolic simplicity of another century. And these advocates -- often affluent commuters to Manhattan, horse farm owners and would-be naturalists -- hold their position even as some officials of financially strapped towns point out that dirt roads cost twice as much to maintain as paved roads do. 
 In the process, the dirt road has emerged not so much a symbol of sleepy-town life but of status.
 
Preserving Heritage
 "Years ago, you could tell who the most politically powerful person in town was because his road would be paved," said Ray Keating, a member of the zoning board of appeals here. "Now it's come full circle, and the most powerful live on the dirt roads."
Whenever there is a proposal to pave a stretch of dirt road, there is a skirmish.
In Putnam County, the passions turned litigious when a group of homeowners sued the town a year and a half ago to pre-empt a developer's plans to pave 300-year-old Indian Brook Road. The homeowners won in an out-of-court settlement. Earlier, another group, Dirt Roads of Philipstown, was less successful in preventing the town from paving a few stretches of dirt.
"It's a heritage that we have to preserve for our kids, because once they're paved, they're gone," said Jay M. Vitale, a carpenter who is president of the Indian Brook Road Conservation Association. "It's like wanting to bulldoze George Washington's home."
Here in North Salem, the horse capital of Westchester, an uproar followed a proposal by Mr. Keating to create special tax districts for homeowners on dirt roads so that the extra maintenance expenses would not burden denizens of blacktop. "Anytime you make a proposal like that," he said, "they accuse you of wanting to pave over the town."
 
Dirt Is Costly
 In some towns, officials are just as protective of dirt roads as residents.
A few weeks ago, for example, the post office in New Castle threatened to stop delivering mail along one badly rutted road until it was paved. But the pro-dirt town government reminded the postal service of its legal obligation to carry the mail, regardless of road conditions, and chose to fill the potholes instead.
The controversy over the value of dirt roads is not new, but there is a growing realization of their costliness.
Perhaps no one is as aware of that as highway superintendents. The roads have to be constantly scraped and leveled during the spring thaws by workers on overtime, and then calcium chloride must be used to control dust in summer. Stephen Waterbury, highway superintendent for the Town of Lewisboro, had to spend $25,000 on materials alone during a two-week period last winter.
 
'They Fit the Mold'
 "The dirt roads are a tremendous drain on manpower and resources, especially in a year when you take a $25,000 hit and you're losing $50,000 in state aid," said Mr. Waterbury, who estimated that it costs two to three times more to maintain Lewisboro's 14.5 miles of dirt roads than a similar length of blacktop.
"We have 20th-century traffic and part of an 18th-century highway system out there," he said. "Right now they look really nice. They've hardened up, and so they fit the mold of the little Currier and Ives road, but if you were here in February, you would have heard different."
Karen Iocavelli, a former member of the North Salem planning board and an ardent conservationist said, "Town boards are going to have to take a hard look at which roads should be saved, because there is no question that the cost of maintaining them is becoming prohibitive."
Many longtime residents do not understand how a little asphalt will destroy the semirural atmosphere. Others are simply tired of the inconveniences, from broken axles to towing bills.
 
'Piling On More Dirt'
 Josephine Hodge, a homemaker whose house fronts on a dirt road in Lewisboro, is ready to start a petition drive to have her road paved.
"When the ground is thawing, the road gets so soft that it's impassable," said Mrs. Hodge, who has lived there for 32 years. "The ruts get deep, and they keep piling on more dirt. Sometimes, I feel that our tax dollars are really going nowhere."
In Lewisboro, however, the master plan adopted in 1985 states that dirt roads represent the rural character the town wants to save. "The town philosophically has gone on the record that we would like to keep those roads as long as we can," said the Town Supervisor, Jo Ann Simon. "Yet I'm also aware of the problems they cause in terms of maintenance."
Some officials said that the recession and losses in state aid were making it hard for them to pave roads this year -- even where residents occasionally agreed on paving -- because the initial outlay approached $85,000 a mile for material alone.
"You have to put out a lot of money to leave things the way they are," said Mr. Waterbury of Lewisboro, "but at the same time, you don't have the money to make the big investment that would save money in the future."
Advocates of dirt roads argue that the roads are safer than paved roads because people are forced to drive more slowly. They also slow the pace of development. But more than anything, people seem to enjoy the poetry of dirt roads and the feeling of being transported back in time.
"We don't want to keep other people out," said Suzi Biederman, who lives on Jay Cox Road and who is a member of Dirt Roads of Philipstown. "We want to maintain what is here. That's why we moved here from New York City."
Some, however, question the commitment to rural life of dirt road aficionados. In North Salem, for instance, a homeowner's request to put a small goat breeding farm on 23 acres created a recent stir from residents concerned about odors and manure run-off. The request was rejected by the zoning board of appeals.
"You get this schizophrenic view," said Mr. Keating, who cast a dissenting vote. "People will use the issue of rural character, but they don't really mean rural so much as neat white fences. Rural is semichaotic with working farms that smell. Goats are not prestigious. They may be rural, but they are not prestigious."

HEADLINE: Brazil Seeks To Resolve Debt Impasse

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRASILIA, June 16

 BODY:
On the eve of a visit to the United States, Brazil's President and his new Economy Minister said in interviews here today that they planned to speed up talks with commercial banks over Brazil's $50 billion foreign debt.
"We have a sense of urgency," Marcilio Marques Moreira, the Economy Minister, said of the debt impasse which has moved little in the first 15 months of the Government here. "I hope that by the end of the year we might have it wrapped up." 
 Several hundred yards away, at the Planalto Palace, President Fernando Collor de Mello indicated that the new urgency comes from the top.
"I would have been very happy if this negotiation over our debt had been concluded last year," said the 41-year-old President. "No one is more desirous of a quick conclusion of debt-negotiation process than I am, than the Brazilian Government is."
 
Talks With Bankers
 On Monday, the President and the Economy Minister are to arrive in Washington for a four-day visit. In an indication of the trip's new emphasis on debt, a day in Los Angeles was dropped in favor of a day in New York -- Thursday -- to talk with bankers.
As a signal to the banks, Brazil's delegation will include a new debt negotiator, Pedro Malan, Brazil's representative to the Inter-American Development Bank. It was announced here on Thursday that Jorio Dauster, debt negotiator since last year, would be reassigned to Brussels.
Mr. Dauster was the last holdover from the economic team of Zelia Cardoso de Mello, who resigned one month ago as Economy Minister. Bankers had complained that Ms. Cardoso's approach on the debt was highly confrontational and yielded few results.
Indeed, when Mr. Collor meets with President Bush on Tuesday morning at the White House, the Brazilian will be unable to report much progress on the debt issue. The Senate here delayed until Tuesday a vote on an agreement to repay $8 billion in back interest.
 
Little Progress on Debt
 Approval is expected, but leftist opposition to resuming full payments on the debt remains high. Today, a Supreme Court Justice here rejected a petition by a coalition of five left-wing parties to suspend all debt-service payments until Congress establishes the "legitimacy" of the loans.
Despite these distractions, bankers and economists interviewed here and in Rio de Janeiro believe that the Government wants to move quickly in talks that are to begin in July over rescheduling principal and interest in Brazil's medium- and long-term debt.
"He want's a deal, I know it," the Rio de Janeiro representative of an American bank said of Mr. Moreira. Before becoming Economy Minister, Mr. Moreira served as Brazil's Ambassador to the United States and, before that, as a director for Unibanco, Brazil's fifth-largest private banking group.
At the United States Embassy here, an official said, "It's a real speed-up over what we were hearing from Zelia."
"In Washington, they are going to ask for as much U.S. Government help as possible," the official continued, recalling official United States Government backing for securities in Mexico's debt restructuring.
But this week, in a written interview with Brazil's newsweekly Veja, President Bush seemed to discourage seeking American Government aid.
Asked about official debt reductions extended recently to Poland and Egypt, Mr. Bush responded that Poland was "a unique operation" and Egypt had a "crucial role in regional stability."
"With a cautious economic policy, the Brazilian economy, which is diversified and resistant, can and will overcome the debt problem," Mr. Bush wrote.
Caution seems to be a byword for Mr. Moreira, a discreet diplomat, who spent much of his first month assuring business people that he would not impose any new radical shock programs. During the first year of Mr. Collor's Government, the economy shrank by 7 percent -- largely as a result of Mr. Cardoso's shock experiments.
As if to present a calming image, Mr. Moreira has been photographed walking on Sundays on Ipanema beach in Rio and dining during the week in Brasilia with captains of industry.
"Nobody is thinking about a new economic package right now, and we know there's a team open to discussions," Jose Mindlin, the president of a major metal-working company, recently told Gazeta Mercantil, Brazil's leading business newspaper. "This does away with part of the anxiety in the business community."
 
Modest Inflation Rate
 Next month, Mr. Moreira plans to ease Brazil fully out of price controls imposed last January by Ms. Cardoso. Helping him is a modest 7 percent monthly inflation rate for May and a predicted 9 percent rate for June.
In recent weeks, two free-market changes have been been introduced: the start of a privatization program with the listing of terms of sale for a state steel company, and the opening of Brazil's stock market to direct investment by overseas institutional investors.
In Mr. Moreira's first month as minister the index of Sao Paulo's stock exchange, a volatile bourse, doubled to 11,000. At the same time, the value of Brazil's foreign debt on the secondary market has reached a 15-month high -- 31 cents on the dollar.
 
Unfrozen Bank Accounts
 In late May, an attempted national strike fizzled. And with production improving in Sao Paulo's factories, most economists contend the nation is beginning to pull out of one of the deepest recessions in memory.
But looming in September is another legacy of Ms. Cardoso -- the scheduled unfreezing of bank accounts.
Francisco Gros, new president of the Central Bank here, estimates that half of the currency frozen in March 1990 has already leaked back into the economy. But, many economists predict a surge of inflation in September, when the first parcel of frozen money is released to its owners.

HEADLINE: Trump's Debt Revision Nearly Done

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. HYLTON

 BODY:
On the eve of an important regulatory hearing, the restructuring of Donald J. Trump's holdings is near completion and the developer has settled most of the major legal and financial issues facing his deeply indebted empire, Mr. Trump and some of his big bank lenders say.
The New Jersey Casino Control Commission meets this morning to review Mr. Trump's financial stability and whether he has been able to reorganize his bank debts. In April, the commission told the developer that he had to complete new loan agreements with his banks and bondholders by today's hearing or the gambling licenses for his three Atlantic City casinos might not be renewed. 
 Over the weekend, executives of the Trump Organization, the developer's main corporate vehicle, negotiated with the leading bondholders of the Trump Castle casino over a $41 million payment due today on $351.8 million of bonds. The Castle was the last of Mr. Trump's casinos to reach a major agreement with creditors.
People close to the talks said that the Castle bondholders agreed to a roughly outlined deal that would reduce the interest rate on the bonds to about 9.5 percent, from the original 13.75 percent, and would eliminate this year's interest payments. In exchange, the bondholders will get 50 percent ownership in the casino from Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump will retain the option to raise his stake to 75 percent depending on whether the casino's performance improves in the future.
Earlier, Mr. Trump had reached a settlement with some of the major holders of Resorts International bonds who were suing him for fraudulent conveyance in connection with his acquisition of the then unfinished Taj Mahal casino in 1988. The bondholders claimed that when Mr. Trump sold Resorts International to Merv Griffin in 1988, he fraudulently took millions of dollars out of the company.
Under the terms of the settlement, which the bondholders are expected to approve, Mr. Trump and one of his insurance companies will pay Resorts bondholders several million dollars to drop all claims of fraud.
Most of the big banks that lent Mr. Trump nearly $2 billion have signed a letter expressing confidence in his debt reorganization. The letter, along with the specific terms of the various loan agreements and payment reschedulings, will be presented at today's casino commission hearing.
In the letter, according to people involved in the bank negotiations, Mr. Trump's bankers express confidence that the restructuring of Mr. Trump's holdings will be completed in the near future and that this will lend some stability to his web of heavily indebted assets.
 
$70 Million in Cash
 In a letter sent to the casino commission last week, Stephen F. Bollenbach, chief financial officer of the Trump Organization, said the Trump casinos and "other properties" had in excess of $70 million in cash.
Last Friday, Mr. Trump made a $16.5 million interest payment on bonds issued by his Trump Plaza casino in Atlantic City. That payment was made one day before its due date.
As part of the restructuring plans with banks announced earlier, Mr. Trump will be released from his personal guarantee of hundreds of millions of dollars in loans. In exchange, he will give up ownership of the Trump Shuttle airline, all but a tiny percentage of his 50 percent interest in New York's Grand Hyatt Hotel, and his yacht, the Trump Princess.
The developer has also agreed to cede 20 percent of his Taj Mahal casino to bondholders in a restructuring that will put the Taj through what is known as a prepackaged bankruptcy. In such a deal, most creditors approve of a debt settlement before bankruptcy is filed. The actual bankruptcy filing then becomes a legal way of breaking original contracts and officially establishing new credit agreements.

HEADLINE: PART-TIME HIRINGS BRING DEEP CHANGE IN U.S. WORKPLACES

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN

 BODY:
In a slow but unmistakable erosion of the five-day, 40-hour week, more and more Americans are finding that the only work they can get is part time.
Throughout the economy, and particularly in retail businesses, companies are seeking to save money and gain flexibility by building their work forces around part-time workers, whose schedules can be lengthened, shortened or turned upside down each week to meet an employer's immediate needs. 
 And though many people choose part-time work, the sharpest increase in the labor force is among involuntary part-timers: those who want but cannot find jobs with regular hours and rewards.
While the nonagricultural work force grew 54 percent from 1970 to 1990, the number of involuntary part-timers jumped 121 percent, to 4.9 million, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which gets its figures through household surveys. The ranks of voluntary part-timers grew 69 percent.
 
Where Industry Flourished
 The proliferation of involuntary part-time work is most pronounced in recessions like the current one and in old, once heavily industrial regions like the Pittsburgh area.
Part-time status leaves people like Dorothy Watkins in poverty. Ms. Watkins, a 31-year-old, twice-divorced mother of two boys, lives with them in a trailer without a telephone in Wellsburg, W.Va. She cannot find a job there, she said, so she drives the 35 miles to a Giant Eagle supermarket in Pittsburgh. She usually works five days a week, from 4 to 10 P.M. -- all that management permits her, she said.
Ms. Watkins, who has been getting $4.25, the national minimum wage, is soon to get a 40-cent hourly raise, as a result of a new contract following a strike against Giant Eagle by the United Food and Commercial Workers union. But the $624 increase in her $6,630 annual income from the store and to the $100 a month in child support she receives from a former husband will not go very far.
 
Can Open Opportunities
 From her pay, she subtracts $80 a month for her lot in a trailer park and $65 a month for the loan on her car, plus medical expenses for herself, electricity for the trailer and gasoline and automobile insurance. That leaves her eligible for $150 a month in food stamps and Medicaid for the children, aid that she would gladly trade for the chance to work more. "I don't like going to the welfare," she said.
Not all part-time work is undesirable. For people with highly prized, highly paid skills, like accountants or computer programmers, part-time work is an appealing alternative. The growth of part-time jobs has also opened opportunities for people who want more money but have competing demands for their time, like children. And while few part-time workers get full benefits, many are covered by spouses' benefits.
Still, part-timers suffer many disadvantages. Often they do not know how many hours, or which shift, they will work in a given week until the previous Thursday or Friday. If they are laid off, they rarely get severance pay.
Federal law requires that employers make Social Security contributions for part-timers and that they grant the same retirement benefits they give full-timers to those who work 1,000 hours a year, or 20 hours a week. But it says nothing about full-time workers' biggest benefit: health insurance.
Soaring health-care costs are giving employers more incentive than ever to use part-timers. In a study of part-time work in March, the General Accounting Office, an investigative and auditing arm of Congress, reported that retail stores provided health insurance for 47 percent of their full-time workers but just 10 percent of part-timers.
 
The 1970's Set a Trend
 Without health insurance, workers must be ready to pay for their own health care unless they are poor enough to qualify for Medicaid, the Federal and state health program.
The accounting office study said 33 states denied unemployment benefits to part-time workers unless their earnings exceeded $2,000 a year. Of families headed by part-time workers, the study said, 21 percent have incomes below the poverty line, as against 5 percent of families headed by full-time workers.
Most of the increase in involuntary part-timers happened in the 1970's. After shooting up in the 1981-82 recession, the growth slowed in the rest of the 1980's, when people could easily find regular jobs. But in the first five months of this year, the bureau reported June 7, the involuntary part-time work force has averaged 5.7 million people, one million above the level of a year ago. The Government says there were about 105 million civilian nonagricultural workers over the age of 16 as of May.
Much of the growth in involuntary part-time workers took place in retail businesses.
 
How Statistics Can Mislead
 The Government statistics understate the place of part-time work in the economy, said Chris Tilly, an economist at the University of Lowell in Massachusetts. In a study of part-time work conducted for the Labor Department, he noted that the Government counts part-time workers, not part-time jobs. Some workers, for example, hold two or three involuntary part-time jobs. They are counted as full-timers, but in their pay, benefits and working conditions they are part-timers.
Giant Eagle, the only supermarket chain in Pittsburgh, is a believer in the part-time work force. Of its more than 6,000 employees, more than four-fifths fall into the category. It pays them a lower hourly rate than it pays full-time employees who do the same jobs, and it grants them fewer benefits.
For Giant Eagle and many other employers, part-time workers help achieve efficiency, hold down costs and serve customers better. If most customers show up between 4 and 10 P.M., why not have extra cashiers working those hours and only those hours?
"People now want you to be open 24 hours a day, seven days a week," said Joseph R. Faccenda, senior vice president at Giant Eagle. "You need a work force of full-timers to give you stability, but you need part-timers to give you flexibility."
 
Counted as 'Full Time'
 As far as the Government is concerned, Mary Rockymore is a full-time worker. The single mother of children ages 16, 11 and 8, she has been earning $5.25 an hour for 17 to 21 hours' work a week as a bakery clerk at Giant Eagle. She also earns $7 an hour working 27 to 30 hours as a gynecologist's secretary. Ms. Rockymore earns too much to qualify for public assistance, but her Giant Eagle health insurance covers only her. She gets none from the gynecologist, so she has to be resourceful in getting help for an asthmatic daughter.
"When she gets sick, I go to the hospital and explain that I have no health insurance, and they give her medicine samples," she said. Now and then, people in her neighborhood sell their food stamps to her, which is illegal. "If they have $50 worth, they might sell them for $25 or $30," she said.
Some retailers, including Giant Eagle, defy the dictionary by employing people who are part-timers in name only. Scores of Giant Eagle employees work well beyond the 35 hours a week that the Bureau of Labor Statistics considers the minimum for full-time work, but the company declares them part-timers, pays them a lower hourly rate than full-timers and provides them the same meager benefits that a 20-hour-a-week worker receives.
No law requires an employer to extend full-time benefits and pay rates to all who work more than 35 hours a week. But as part of the strike settlement, Giant Eagle made one concession: Part-timers who work an average of 40 hours a week for a year will be given health benefits not only for themselves, which has been the practice for such workers, but also for their families.
Robert Derberry, 59, works 53 hours a week cleaning the bakery at a Giant Eagle. Three years ago, as a machinist at a printing company, he earned $11.75 an hour, more than twice his pay now.
"They had real good benefits -- hospitalization, eye care, dental care, good retirement," he said. "Germany bought them out, and they took all the stuff to Germany."
Mr. Derberry works seven days a week: from 2 to 10 P.M. Monday through Saturday and from 2 to 7 P.M. on Sundays -- 53 hours. Like other part-timers who have been with the company more than a year, he has been getting health insurance for himself. But unlike full-timers, he does not receive insurance for his wife. He will qualify for benefits for her after he works 40 hours a week for a full year from the date of the new union contract.
How does Giant Eagle decide which 50-hour-a-week employees are full-timers and which are part-timers? Partly on the basis of seniority and ability.
In addition, Mr. Faccenda said, the company often offers full-time jobs on night shifts or at stores in undesirable locations if few part-timers can be found to take those jobs. But Mr. Derberry said he had never received such an offer.
 
Stability and Flexibility
 Around Pittsburgh, Giant Eagle has been an important factor in the growth of part-time work, much of it tied to the region's shift from manufacturing to service jobs in recent decades. Jobs in fast-growing stores, fast-food outlets, hospitals, health-care businesses and many other services, all big users of part-timers, displaced five-day, 40- hour manufacturing jobs.
Giant Eagle has proved a master of the odd-hour economy. Facing declining sales from competition at the start of the 1980's, it won sharp wage cuts from its unionized workers, then undertook a price-cutting campaign that drove out other chains, including A&P and Kroger.
Responding to appeals from the union that he do more for part-timers, Mr. Faccenda asked: "How long do you want to stay in business? You become uncompetitive. Your business goes down. People lose their jobs."
People like Ms. Watkins, the part-timer from West Virginia, should look elsewhere for work, he said. "Logically, if somebody has a family to raise, this job wasn't meant for them."
But for some people in Pittsburgh, like Emily and Tom Hickey, who were married in April, it is hard to find anything better. Mr. Hickey, 36, is an auto mechanic. His pay varies from $100 to $400 a week because he is paid by the job, not by the time he spends at it. He gets no benefits.
After five years in the meat department at a Giant Eagle, Ms. Hickey, 34, has health benefits only for herself. She works 40 to 48 hours a week for $5.90 an hour, a little over half what some full-timers get.
"The part-timers thought they should have given us more," Ms. Hickey said. "I did service meats. I did gourmet. I am now in seafood. I do all the work of a full-timer. I deserve to be a full-timer."

HEADLINE: U.S. Ban of Infected Travelers Attacked at World AIDS Conference

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FLORENCE, June 16

 BODY:
The United States Government came under sharp attack at the opening of the seventh international meeting on AIDS here today for its policy on restricting entry of travelers infected with the disease.
The critics, including scientists and health officials from around the world, also attacked the Bush Administration's last-minute decision to send only a couple hundred Federal scientists -- half the size of the original delegation -- to Italy for the six-day meeting. 
 In addresses to the 8,000 participants, European health officials vehemently criticized the Bush Administration policy of excluding from the United States foreigners infected with the AIDS virus. Organizers of the next international meeting, to be held next year in Boston, have said it may have to be canceled if the travel restrictions remain.
In a letter given to each participant, Harvard University, sponsor of the Boston meeting, said, "If this cancellation occurs, the resulting year's delay in progressagainst AIDS will be the responsibility of the government of the U.S."
Vasso Papandreou, the Commissioner for Health and Social Affairs of the European Communities in Brussels, said her organization had made a point of congratulating Italy for providing unhindered entry for people infected with the virus. including participants at the meeting. Mrs. Papandreou said she would write the Health and Human Services Secretary, Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, to express her organization's concern about the travel restriction.
In criticizing the reduction of the United States delegation to Florence, speakers cited the pressing need to answer scientific puzzles like how the AIDS virus spreads in the body to paralyze the immune system. The human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS, is known to be transmitted through sexual intercourse and blood, but scientists do not know what cells the virus first infects.
The Federal Government, which sent more than 700 scientists to last year's meeting in San Francisco, first held this year's delegation to 400 because of the cost of foreign travel. Last week, the Administration and Congress imposed new budget restrictions, causing the Public Health Service to halve its delegation.
Dr. William Roper, the head of the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, the Federal agency responsible for tracking the AIDS epidemic, was among those who canceled at the last minute.
 
Scurrying for Refunds
 Today, Federal officials were seen scurrying to negotiate for refunds of hotel-room deposits and the meeting's registration fee, which was as high as $700 a person. Organizers of the meeting said the fees were not refundable, and it was not immediately clear whether any money was saved.
Repeated attempts to reach the United States Public Health Service for comment were unsuccessful.
Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the head of National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease and the ranking Federal scientist here, said he was "disturbed we couldn't send many of our scientists here." Some, he said, paid their own way.
Dr. Giovanni Battista Rossi, the chairman of the AIDS meeting here, said the exchange of ideas among scientists was an important part of meetings like this and that participants would sorely miss the opportunity for discussion with the American scientists who could not attend.
An increasing number of scientists are questioning the value of large meetings like this one, which will cost $8.5 million. The AIDS meetings have been innovative in including patients with the disease to help learn about the social, political, economic and ethical aspects of AIDS. But in recent years, fewer major advances and research findings have been presented at such large meetings, with more scientists choosing to release their findings in professional journals.
Speakers at the opening session pleaded for a greater public response to the worldwide AIDS epidemic, particularly in developing countries.
Dr. Vulimiri Ramalingaswami of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi said Asia was "sitting on top of a volcano" with respect to AIDS.

HEADLINE: ESSAY;
The End of Union

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
On June 22, 1941 50 years ago this Saturday -- Hitler's "Operation Barbarossa" began: three million German troops invaded the Soviet Union. The "Great Patriotic War," as Communists like to call it, gave a temporary sense of nationhood to a far-flung collection of separate peoples who never were a nation.
Now, a half-century later, that imperial unity is dissolved, defeated not by any invader but by the failure of its overextended tyranny. The Soviet "union" is no more a union today than the British Empire is an empire. 
 June 1991 is the month that historians may choose as the end of the unnatural union. Mikhail Gorbachev, last of the unionists, began this epochal month with a Nobel speech throwing his empire on the mercy of the world, whining that it was "entitled to expect large-scale support" and threatening that "a new peaceful period in history will vanish" if his demands for money to maintain the old order are not met.
Following that death rattle of an expiring system, the Russian people, for the first time in their long history, went to the polls to choose a leader. The election of the anti-Communist Boris Yeltsin proclaims the Russian acceptance of the dissolution of the bonds of empire, and the devolution of power to the various republics.
The Soviet "union" is now a fiction, its facade maintained by old party apparatchiks and K.G.B. and Red Army bosses who know that with the end of the myth of homo sovieticus, "the new Soviet man," their power to do more than negotiate arms reductions will end.
The reality is Russia. The reality is eight other peoples who may be amenable to a loose association of sovereign states. The reality is three other republics and three Baltic nations that rightly consider themselves free and independent.
Is this breakup of the last imperial power good for the cause of freedom and conducive to peace? Not if you listen to our State Department status-quo enthusiasts, our Charles River Chicken Littles, our foreign policy establishment drawn up in vast, cumbrous array.
Their mantra is disintegration, as if the U.S.S.R. were still integrated or ought to be; they caution against dismemberment, as if Georgia and the Ukraine were arms of the Russian body; they warn of chaos, as if only the continuance of Moscow's old internal empire could avert anarchy.
If you buy their conclusion that the political realignment now on the march is headed not toward freedom but toward chaos, then you will find their policy makes sense: we should prop up the union, dole out money to encourage experiments with a market system and democracy, and thereby make certain that the nuclear missiles remain in responsible hands.
But what if that chaos assumption is wrong? What if the hard times and angry desire for great change now in crescendo are ameliorated by Western aid, and the Kremlin centralists are permitted to regain their authority? Once past the crisis, they can be depended upon to revert to type, and we will once again confront an expansionist superpower.
Chaos-mongers forget that the driving force for productive change is pervasive disgust with the way things are in a Communist union. The only way to improvement must be a leap into capitalism -- no more baby steps, no more hot air about phony reform and no more vain hope that Western governments will come to the rescue.
The notion that other governments can solve their problem gives the Kremlin unionists' game away. They will never understand that relief cannot come from infusions of other governments' capital. The only investment massive enough to help must come from private enterprise willing to take risk to make a profit.
That investment will come only when Russia and the other freed countries embrace private property, let the currency become convertible and make profit possible in an atmosphere of freedom.
The Russian people, by their vote last week, have shown they will follow a politician in this direction. In his meeting this week with President Yeltsin, President Bush should urge him on; he should not undercut this Russian's unprecedented mandate with warnings against disunion.
Breaking up is hard to do, but it is necessary and right; we should not make it harder by holding out false hopes of a union bailout.

HEADLINE: Editorial Notebook;
Wrong Track for Tribes

BYLINE: By RICHARD E. MOONEY

 BODY:
Connecticut is getting a casino, like it or not. Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan has approved the operation of a gambling hall on the Mashantucket Pequot Indian reservation near New London. Two governors tried to stop it, but the Pequots won in court.
Casino gambling now has another foothold, setting a precedent for still more. It may seem ugly to object just when Indians are getting a crack at this lucrative business. But the overriding issue is the spread of casino gambling; that the issue is raised by Indians is unfortunate happenstance. 
 Casino promoters didn't really need the Pequots' help. States are turning to gambling for "painless" revenue. Iowa now has riverboat gambling on the Mississippi. Four old Colorado mining towns are opening modern mock-ups of Wild West gambling dens. This may be painless for politicians who shy from raising taxes, but it is hardly a wholesome social standard.
While Native Americans have as much right as anyone to take the casino plunge, it's a sad fact that they are driven by economic distress. Some tribes have a sound base in manufacturing, but it's easier to open gaming halls than factories. Gambling also offers quick profit for little investment; the Pequots got financing from Malaysia after U.S. lenders turned them down.
Florida Seminoles started gambling as a business in the 1970's with high-stakes bingo. The state tried to crack down but lost in court, and the games quickly spread to other tribes. In 1987, the Supreme Court upheld the lower courts' essential point: If state law prohibits an activity, reservations must respect the prohibition. But they are not subject to regulation of activities the state permits.
Connecticut bans casinos but lets charities and other worthy causes sponsor casino-style Las Vegas Nights to raise money. Balking at the Pequots' casino plan, Connecticut argued that one-night games and a full-time gambling hall are distinguishable; the courts said they're not.
Still, casinos aren't bingo. They attract different crowds. Governors and state law enforcement authorities who resist casinos on reservations are rightly concerned with the unsavory elements that swarm to casinos; the Pequots share this concern and are cooperating with the state in planning for the casino's regulation. But authorities also fear that the establishment of an Indian casino creates pressure for casinos statewide.
Roughly 125 tribes operate some 150 gaming establishments now. Estimates of their annual gross run as high as $700 million. About half of these enterprises are for bingo; one high-tech Mega Bingo game links reservations in seven states by satellite and offers $500,000 jackpots. A third are card rooms, and most of the rest are things like off-track betting and video games.
Some tribes, particularly some large ones, don't want reservation gambling any more than Connecticut governors do. They don't like intrusive outsiders. A number have succeeded in mainstream businesses, largely through their own efforts. Blessed with natural resources, more than 30 tribes are in oil and gas. Others are in timber and mining.
The Mississippi Choctaws make parts for Ford. Several tribes have Pentagon contracts. And the Wisconsin Winnebagos are starting a pharmaceutical company to make generic and non-prescription drugs. The Winnebagos are using profits from bingo, a widely accepted game with none of the social risk that comes with casinos. The spread of casinos is unwelcome.

HEADLINE: A Screwy Subsidy for Drivers

 BODY:
Your employer can give you $15 worth of tax-free tokens, passes or fare cards each month for riding to work on public transportation. If it's more, you're taxed on the full amount, not just the part over $15. There is no such lid, however, when companies provide free parking for people who commute by car. That's a tax-exempt freebie, worth hundreds of dollars.
Sound screwy? It is. Heedless of fuel efficiency and the environment, the tax code favors driving to work. President Bush's energy message declared that something -- he didn't say what -- should be done about it. Administration officials lean toward a one-third increase in the modest mass-transit subsidy, plus an adjustment for inflation. 
 Meanwhile, the Internal Revenue Service is proceeding with the inflation adjustment, raising the $15 ceiling to $21. That would last only nine days in New York City, and less in some places.
The tax technocrats don't address the disparity between subsidies, nor would they change the rule on taxing the entire amount when it exceeds the tax-free limit. Only Congress can fix those things.
The theory behind the $15 exemption is that it's de minimis -- too small to fuss with. A dozen bills in Congress offer a more sensible ceiling; most say $60 or more. But the best idea comes from two Republicans, Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and Representative Jan Meyers of Kansas. They would equalize the transit and parking subsidies by canceling the exemption for parking unless employees were also offered an equivalent amount for travel by mass transit and car or van pools.
Tax purists oppose all such subsidies, but that's unrealistic. Employers aren't about to impose parking fees on their lots, and Congress won't make them do so. True, a fixed subsidy benefits employees unequally, depending on their tax bracket. But that's already the case with parking privileges, and it's a subject too prickly for Congress.
The current bias in favor of cars is both bad policy and unfair. It's time to strike a balance.

HEADLINE: Sir W. Arthur Lewis, 76, Is Dead; Winner of Nobel Economics Prize

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO

 BODY:
Sir W. Arthur Lewis, a Princeton University professor emeritus who was an adviser to several nations and won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science in 1979, died on Saturday at his home in Barbados. He was 76 years old.
Sir Arthur was considered a leading authority on economic growth and political and social change in emerging nations. He shared the economics prize with Theodore W. Schultz, a University of Chicago professor, for research into economic development "with particular consideration of the problems of developing countries." 
 In 1954, he published what many economists considered one of the first academic works in this area, "The Theory of Economic Growth." He also wrote 11 other books and more than 80 monographs and articles.
William Arthur Lewis was born on St. Lucia in 1915 and was educated at the University of London, where he earned his bachelor's degree in 1937 and a doctorate in 1940. He taught there until 1948, when he left for the University of Manchester. He was named vice chancellor of the University of the West Indies in Kingston, Jamaica, in 1959.
He joined Princeton's faculty in 1963 and was named the James Madison Profesor of Political Economy. He taught undergraduate and graduate courses in economic development and modern economic history.
Students praised Sir Arthur's courses for focusing on ideas rather than numbers. He retired in 1983.
He had been named an honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1962.
Sir Arthur is survived by his wife, Gladys Jacobs Lewis of Barbados and Princeton, N.J.; two daughters, Elizabeth Lewis of Cranbury, N.J., and Barbara Lewis of Brooklyn; and four brothers, Stanley Lewis of Ghana, Earl Lewis of Trinidad, Allen Lewis, a former Governor General of St. Lucia, and Victor Lewis of St. Lucia.
A state funeral is planned for Saturday on St. Lucia.

HEADLINE: William Ogdon, 89, On Editorial Board of New York Times

 BODY:
William D. Ogdon, a member of the editorial board of The New York Times from 1946 to 1966, died on Saturday at his home in Tarrytown, N.Y. He was 89 years old.
He died of a heart attack, his son, Thomas, said. 
Mr. Ogdon specialized in writing editorials on the political, economic and governmental issues of New York City and New York State. In his 35 years at the newspaper, he had also been a copy editor and later contributed articles to The Times Magazine and The Times Book Review.
On the eve of his retirement in 1955, the Citizens Budget Commission gave him a special award for "high public service." It cited "his well-informed editorial comments on all phases of municipal affairs over a period of many years and especially for his penetrating analyses of municipal finance" in 1965 that disclosed the significance of the city's efforts to gain new taxing authority from the State Legislature.
William Duley Ogdon was born in Hoopeston, Ill., and grew up in Toledo, Ohio. He earned a bachelor's degree at Transylvania College and did graduate studies at Yale. He was a reporter with The Toledo Times and a rewrite man and copy editor with The St. Louis Globe-Democrat.
He joined The New York Times in 1931, working successively as a copy editor, an editor in the Washington bureau and on the editorial page. In World War II he served in Navy intelligence and on the carrier Yorktown in the Pacific, rising to commander.
Surviving, besides his son, who lives in Manhattan, is his wife of 59 years, Juanita; a daughter, Judith Gardner of Lexington, Ky., five grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 18, 1991, Tuesday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an obituary yesterday about William D. Ogdon, a former editorial writer for The New York Times, misstated his retirement year. It was 1966, not 1955.

HEADLINE: U.S. Says Honda Skirted Customs Fees

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 16

 BODY:
After a yearlong audit, the United States Customs Service has concluded that Honda took improper advantage of the United States-Canada free-trade agreement to avoid paying millions of dollars in duties on cars imported into the United States from its Alliston, Ontario, plant.
 Under the agreement, which was intended to encourage the use of auto parts and labor from the United States and Canada, cars assembled in one of the two countries and shipped across the border are exempt from tariffs if at least half their content comes from either country. 
Although the American Honda Motor Company said it met that test, Customs Service auditors said the actual "North American content" of Honda Civics imported from the Ontario plant was 25 percent to 30 percent less than the amounts claimed by the company, a subsidiary of the Tokyo-based Honda Motor Company. The auditors made their conclusions in a confidential report, a copy of which was obtained by a reporter.
 Details of the Honda audit were obtained from Bush Administration officials and Congressional aides eager to see the free-trade pact with Canada vigorously enforced.
 The preliminary conclusions come as the United States and Canada are negotiating a similar pact with Mexico.
 Honda, which had not seen the report, disputed its conclusions when told of them. The company said it believed that its cars produced in Canada for sale in the United States were entitled to duty-free treatment.
 In a confidential memorandum to the Treasury Department reporting preliminary results of the audit, Customs Commissioner Carol B. Hallett said, "We have determined that Honda has failed to meet the requirements for free-tariff treatment" under the trade agreement.
 Accordingly, she said, the Customs Service intends to "begin action immediately to collect $20 million in duties for vehicles imported in 1989 and 1990."
 Before imposing additional duties, the Customs Service usually gives an importer 20 days to challenge the proposed action. Once the agency decides how much is due, the company normally must pay that amount before it can file a formal protest with the Customs Service.
 
'Rules of Origin' Dispute
 The auditors did not accuse Honda of fraud, but said the company had manipulated the free-trade agreement's "rules of origin," ignored "commercial realities" and misrepresented the company's costs in an effort to avoid tariffs.
 Valuation of merchandise for customs purposes is often a complex matter in today's global economy, in which parts and labor come from many countries. As a result, manufacturers may disagree with the Customs Service about how much of a product originates overseas and how much should be counted as American.
 Donald Harrison, a lawyer for Honda, said the company had cooperated with the audit and had given the Government several memorandums explaining its position.
 "This is not just a question of dollars and cents," said Mr. Harrison, a lawyer in the Washington office of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher. "It's a matter of pride for Honda, which has invested billions of dollars in its North American operations."
 Honda is the leading Japanese auto maker in the United States. Its sales here have more than doubled during the last decade, and its Accord model is the best-selling car in the country.
 
Could Be Embarrassing to Bush
 The Customs Service report is likely to be used by members of Congress who object to the proposed agreement with Mexico and have vowed to fight it on Capitol Hill. If it is perceived as revealing a circumvention of the Canada pact, the audit could be embarrassing to the White House, which is pushing hard for the Mexico pact.
 The United States' normal tariff on imported autos is 2.5 percent of a car's value. So if an auto maker qualifies for duty-free treatment, it can save $200 on an $8,000 car.
 To establish the level of North American content in the Honda Civics that it studied, Customs Service auditors traced the source of parts used to build the vehicles in Marysville, Ohio, and in Ontario. The cars made in Ohio are not subject to tariffs, but the auditors' findings tend to confirm the assertions of independent researchers that the American subsidiaries of Japanese auto makers import many parts for cars they build in the United States.
 Customs officials and other experts on the auto industry, like Sean P. McAlinden, an economist at the University of Michigan, said Hondas produced in Canada or the United States generally have a higher proportion of North American parts and labor than vehicles sold in this country by other Japanese auto makers like Toyota. So if the Hondas do not meet the test for duty-free treatment, they said, it is highly unlikely that other imports will.
 
Pricing 'Defies Explanation'
 In addition to questioning Honda's country-of-origin percentages, the Customs Service audit also said the company's pricing policy sometimes "defies explanation." The auditors said Honda offered cars for sale to consumers in the United States at less than the cost of manufacture, as computed by the Customs Service.
 The practice of selling below cost, known as dumping, is used by companies that are willing to sustain losses to increase their share of the market. It can harm domestic industries by undercutting their prices.
 Among the auditors' findings, as described in confidential Customs Service documents, were the following:
 *The manufacturing costs of Honda Civics, as computed by Customs auditors, often exceeded the values reported to the Customs Service when the vehicles entered the United States from Canada. Some vehicles deemed by Customs to cost $8,146 were listed, at entry, as having a value of $6,868 and were offered for sale to consumers with a sticker price of $6,635, or roughly $1,500 less than the cost of manufacture.
 *Honda is willing and able to "exercise control" over prices charged by Japanese or Japanese-controlled suppliers to which it is linked in a "web of cross-ownership." Some affiliated auto-parts suppliers "sell to Honda at a price below their cost of manufacture and continually operate at a loss."
 *"Rather than basing prices on market-force factors such as actual North American costs, profit or customer-supplier negotiations, Honda prices within North America are developed and fixed in accordance with the dictates of Honda Japan."
 In an interview, Michael H. Lane, the Deputy Commissioner of Customs, said the agency had not singled out Japanese companies for investigation. "The Customs Service is doing what it's supposed to do, is carrying out its statutory responsibilities," he said.
 For Honda Civics assembled in Canada, the company certified that $3,350 worth of materials came from North America, but the Customs Service said $1,085 of this amount represented "foreign costs." The agency concluded that at least 62 percent of the materials used to produce the autos -- $3,760 of a total $6,025 -- originated outside North America.
 Even when parts were not imported, they often came from companies affiliated with Honda, the audit report said. "Of approximately $775 of materials or parts for the engine assembled in Ohio," the report said, "only three parts ($9.06) and $42.69 of raw materials are sourced from U.S.-based companies that do not have an equity relationship with Honda."
 The engines are important because they account for a substantial portion of the materials Honda listed as originating in North America.
 Honda's lawyer, Mr. Harrison, said that in calculating the North American content of its cars, Honda was entitled to count not only the direct costs of production but also related costs for the purchasing department, information services and other activities essential to production.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
East Europe's Press Still Beckoning

BYLINE: By DEIRDRE CARMODY

 BODY:
More than a year after the start of a fierce bidding war among foreign publishers for newspapers and magazines in Eastern Europe, the involvement of American media companies there remains minimal.
 Except for Time Warner Inc., which has a partial interest in developing and operating cable systems in Hungary representing 250,000 subscribers and is looking into developing a pay-television movie service there, none of the big American newspaper or magazine publishers are competing for ownership of Eastern Europe's emerging free press. 
On the other hand, Robert Maxwell of Britain; Rupert Murdoch; Robert Hersant, who owns Le Figaro in France, and the Springer and Bertelsmann groups of Germany are staking claims.
 
Media Up for Grabs
 And there are plenty of claims waiting to be staked.
 "Whoever is willing to take something over gets to take it over," said Ruth Whitney, editor in chief of Glamour magazine. "Ownership occurs not by negotiation but by anyone who steps in and fills the void."
 But the difficulty, said Pat Miller, an editor at large for the American Society of Magazine Editors, is "nobody knows who owns what."
 Ms. Whitney and Ms. Miller were members of a group of United States magazine editors and publishers who recently returned from a 12-day trip to Vienna, Budapest, Prague, Berlin, Warsaw and Krakow, Poland, that was sponsored by the society and the Magazine Publishers of America. They said they were impressed by the vitality and inventiveness of journalists struggling to effect a transition from state control to independence.
 
Americans Are Better Trusted
 John Mack Carter, the editor in chief of Good Housekeeping and director of development at Hearst magazines, said the running thread in the talks with East European journalists was their wariness of foreign investment and desire to limit foreign ownership. But while many of them were uneasy about European entrepreneurs, they were more trusting of Americans, Mr. Carter found.
 "They are like heat-seeking missiles, coming after greenbacks and looking to the U.S.A.," he said.
 One American testing the waters in Eastern Europe is Edward T. Giller, a former broadcaster based in Altoona, Pa. He and two partners set up Pentor Communications International, an American company that has commitments in excess of $2 million in joint media ventures in Poland.
 
A Polish Women's Magazine
 A year ago, Mr. Giller and his partners became majority shareholders in a venture with members of the staff of Uroda, a women's magazine formerly published by Interpress, a state-owned media conglomerate. A monthly with a circulation of 200,000, it has articles on how to earn money and how women should not be afraid to be as smart as men, profiles of successful women and features on hair, clothes and decorating the office.
 Pentor is also involved in a venture with executives of The Warsaw Voice, a two-year-old weekly and the only English-language newspaper in Poland. Simultaneous delivery in the United States will begin in July when the 24-page tabloid, costing $3 an issue, will seek readers among executives interested in doing business in Poland.
 Other Pentor ventures in Poland include a desperately needed market research firm, the only publication offering television and radio listings and a television production company.
 Market research is virtually nonexistent in Poland. As a result, publishers rarely know who their readers are. As in many East European countries, magazine distribution is controlled by the state-owned postal service. Readers sign up and prepay for magazines at the post office, which, in turn, informs publishers how many copies it will distribute. There is none of the information on age, gender, income or interests of readers that is the mainstay of American advertising.
 Pentor is also working on a distribution system that would make it more profitable for kiosks to sell the company's newspapers and magazines. Pointing to a spirit worthy of United States marketing executives, Mr. Giller said his Polish partners had come up with the idea of buying a new car and giving it to the kiosk owner who sells the most copies of the television-listings magazine in June.
 "The Maxwells and Murdochs have not been well received," Mr. Giller said, "and the Germans are trying to get in. But we have made the Poles realize that our interests and theirs coincide, and they have been very responsive to us. But it's very much like the old West. There is no corporate structure; we make the rules as we go."
 
Cable Venture With Government
 Another American company involved in Poland is Chase Enterprises, a division of Chase Communications, based in Hartford. In a joint venture with the Polish Government, Chase has begun building a cable television service in Gdansk and plans eventually to operate in nine cities. Roger Freedman, president and chief executive of Chase International, said the company had invested "many millions of dollars" in the enterprise.
 Although the spirit of change continues to blow strongly, most publications in Eastern Europe are still state-owned. Some are now quasi-public, owned in part by government and in part by former employees. For instance, Heit Vilaggazdasag/HVG, a weekly economic and political magazine in Budapest that is loosely modeled after The Economist, is now one-quarter staff-owned. The remaining shares are owned by banks and the state commerce department. On the other hand, Mlady Svet, a weekly news magazine in Prague, has been taken over and is being run by 28 members of its staff.
 Other journalists now find themselves out of work. Some editors and reporters worked on newsletters and other house organs for state-owned companies that have closed. Fund for a Free Press
 As part of United States initiatives to help build democracy in Eastern Europe, $5 million has been set aside for the International Media Fund to help countries set up independent broadcasting and a free press.
 The fund is helping to set up American journalism centers in Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia, which will be financed in part by The New York Times Company Foundation Inc., Rutgers University and the University of Maryland.
 Marvin Stone, the fund's president, who is a former editor in chief of U.S. News & World Report and former deputy director of the United States Information Agency, said legislation was being introduced to further the freedom of broadcasting in several of these countries, although many countries prefer a European model like Britain's, under which some channels are run by the state and others by private enterprise.
 
Press Production Obstacles
 The main obstacles for the press, he said, were getting newsprint, which must be imported; finding printing plants and solving distribution problems.
 "National news agencies are still under the control of parliaments, and their directors are appointed by prime ministers," Mr. Stone said.
 In a typical example, Mr. Stone said that in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, the weekly news magazine, which is modeled after Time, had no idea how many magazines were sold every week by the postal service and that it suspected it was "being ripped off."
 "They are not told for 45 days how many were sold," he said, "and then it takes two months before they get the money. That's what an arrogant monopoly means."

CORRECTION-DATE: June 18, 1991, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
An article in the Media Business pages yesterday about foreign financing of Eastern European publications misstated the involvement of The New York Times Company Foundation. The foundation does not help finance the International Media Fund, which is affiliated with the United States Government. It does support the Independent Journalists Initiative, a privately financed group of volunteers from newspaper, television and radio organizations that conducts journalism workshops in Eastern Europe.

HEADLINE: William S. Fishman, 75, Is Dead; Philanthropist and Ex-Executive

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: MERION, Pa., June 17

 BODY:
William S. Fishman, a philanthropist who was co-founder and former chief executive of ARA Services, a service management company, died Saturday. He was 75 years old and lived in Merion.
The cause of death was not immediately available, said a funeral home spokesman. 
 Mr. Fishman co-founded ARA, which helped pioneer the automatic vending business, with Davre Davidson in 1959. He was chairman from 1977 to 1984, doubling the company's business to $3 billion a year as it expanded into food services and school buses. He was president of the company, now based in Philadelphia, from 1964 to 1976 and chief executive from 1975 to 1983.
After he moved to Philadelphia in 1961, Mr. Fishman became involved with the city's cultural, civic and educational programs.
In 1988 Mr. Fishman, who was Jewish, was asked by John Cardinal Krol to become the first chairman of Business Leadership Organized for Catholic Schools, an organization that finances many educational programs. In his tenure the group raised more than $45 million for Roman Catholic schools.
Mr. Fishman also helped establish the Museum of American Jewish History on Independence Mall.
Along with Mr. Davidson, he was honored by ARA in 1982 when the company established the Fishman-Davidson Center for the Study of the Service Sector at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.
Mr. Fishman was a fellow of Brandeis University and established a chair of economics there.
He twice served as president of the National Automatic Merchandising Association and as president of the Jewish Publication Society of America.
He was a director of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Franklin Institute and the Academy of Music.
He leaves his wife, Selma Demchick Ellis Fishman; three sons, Alan, Fred and David; a stepson, Joshua Ellis; a stepdaughter, Jill Feninger; two sisters, and four grandchildren.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS SCENE;
Stagnant Pay: A Delayed Impact

BYLINE: By Louis Uchitelle

 BODY:
THE incomes of most American households have failed to gain ground on inflation since 1973. That much-repeated economic statistic is now common wisdom. What's just now coming to light is the impact that so many years of stagnant incomes is finally having on the American psyche.
Broadly speaking, the old psychology of affluence -- the confidence that homeownership and high levels of consumer spending are birthrights -- is breaking down, demographers and pollsters say. Materialism endures; young Americans still value the good life. But they pick their purchases to simulate affluence, not achieve it. Thus, purchasing a BMW or an Armani suit might be out of reach, but not other stylish clothing or compact disk players or elegant food, and that is where the money goes. 
 "Consumers are learning to make lesser purchases and they are accepting the view that they cannot have it all," said Watts Wacker, executive vice president of Yankelovich Clancy Shulman, a market research company.
The fallout from stagnant incomes came up repeatedly last week at an annual conference in New York sponsored by American Demographics, an organization that explores attitudes and behavior to help companies market products. The impact is particularly noticeable in the under-30 generation, where stress and compromising personal goals are now commonplace, Mr. Wacker and others said.
The Roper Organization, for example, finds that the under-30 population increasingly wants to own homes and have children. But without the wherewithal, marriage and homeownership are postponed. Similarly, college students are more willing than the baby boomers were in the late 1970's to become involved in social causes. But despite their activism, young people more than ever seek jobs that pay well. The baby boomers at the same age had preferred work that interested them. "This is not greed, but simply a desire to deal with a cruel world and to seek a sense of self-sufficiency and security that earlier generations took for granted," said Bickley Townsend, a Roper vice president.
The stagnant income problem also shows up as pent-up demand that remains pent up. In the past, as the American economy came out of recessions and jobs multiplied, restoring incomes, people no longer postponed the purchase of cars and homes, and sales rose sharply. But in the recovery now apparently getting under way, car and home sales are muted, in part because even jobholders often find these major purchases unaffordable.
The Census Bureau reports that 71 percent of all families in which the chief breadwinner is 25 to 34 years old cannot afford median-priced homes in the areas where they live. The percentage rises to 94.1 for families where the chief earner is under 25. As for cars, the average new-car price is equal to 47 percent of the median annual income of American families, up from 35 percent in 1979.
The data on stagnant incomes, a trend not fully recognized by economists until the late 1980's, are now profuse. The Labor Department says the median family income of $30,000 to $35,000 in 1973 is still in that range, after adjustment for inflation. Only the wealthiest 20 percent of American families, those with incomes above $80,000, gained ground on inflation over the last 18 years.
Why wasn't the impact felt sooner? The booming 1980's helped mask the problem of stagnant incomes, in part because so many new jobs were created, although many were low-paying, and so many women went to work, postponing childbirth, says Frank Levy, a University of Maryland economist. Now the birth rate is rising sharply, as women in their late 20's and 30's finally have children. Incomes have to feed more mouths, and the economy is not generating as many new jobs.
That situation probably contributes to a startling statistic in a Yankelovich survey. Suddenly, there is a huge jump in the percentage of women who say they would quit their jobs or reduce their workload if they did not need the money. Some 80 percent of those surveyed gave this answer last year, compared with 39 percent in 1989, Mr. Wacker said.
Income also plays a major role in how much faith people have in government, says Brad Edmondson, editor in chief of American Demographics magazine. "People at the top of the income scale, households with $50,000 a year or more, still believe in solving problems through government," he said, "while people below that level turn more and more to group solutions."
Thus they form child care groups or neighborhood security patrols, volunteering their labor in lieu of payments. For the less affluent, "there is more bonding and celebration of community life," Mr. Edmondson said. "The question is whether these communities will be encompassing, or will tend to segregate groups from each other."

HEADLINE: Gulf Victory: An Energy Defeat?

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
While the allied victory in the Persian Gulf eliminated for now the threat to Western access to Mideast oil, there is widespread agreement in the oil industry that the United States' long-term energy security may have been set back.
The quick war brought oil prices back down near prewar levels, and those lower prices provide little incentive for energy conservation or new drilling in the United States. 
 "We're going to be more import-dependent than under a Saddam Hussein regime" in Kuwait, said Vahan Zanoyan, an analyst with the Petroleum Finance Company, a Washington consulting firm. If Saddam Hussein controlled Kuwait and bullied Saudi Arabia, Middle East experts say, production would be cut and the market price of oil would rise, which would eventually reduce imports by this country.
The Bush Administration has a different view of the war's effect. John J. Easton Jr., Assistant Secretary of Energy for international affairs and energy emergencies, said in an interview in Washington that the war had produced "a heightened awareness of the role energy plays" and had helped unite various Government agencies, including his department and the Departments of Transportation and the Interior, in the formulation of the National Energy Strategy.
That strategy includes drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and counting on provisions of the Clean Air Act to cut gasoline consumption, and would, under the most optimistic interpretation, stabilize the proportion of oil that is imported.
But energy experts say that because the war ended quickly, at relatively low cost to the United States, it did not produce a consensus on steps to reduce oil imports. In the absence of strong Government policy, what defines the pattern of energy production and use is price.
Oil prices are now close to prewar levels. From under $17 for a barrel of crude oil before Iraq began its saber-rattling last July, prices rose to more than $40 in October. Now oil is selling in New York for under $20 a barrel, in contracts for delivery next month. At the gasoline pump, prices have followed a similar trajectory. In the next few months, gasoline and oil prices are unlikely to move sharply in either direction.
One unintended consequence of the war was to centralize further the supply of oil. One-third of the oil produced by the 13 nations of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries now comes from a single source -- Saudi Arabia. Before Iraq invaded Kuwait last August, Saudi Arabia produced less than a quarter of OPEC's oil.
The war, in fact, propelled Saudi Arabia into becoming the world's second-largest oil producer, jumping ahead of the United States. With the likelihood of continued turmoil in the Soviet Union, Saudi Arabia may become the largest oil producer before too many years.
"What we had before was a special relationship with Saudi Arabia," said Daniel C. Yergin, the oil historian. "Now we have a more special relationship."
Saudi exports to the United States last year were about 1.2 million barrels a day, up from 1.1 million in 1989, according to Energy Listener Services, a company in New York that provides news and analysis to the oil industry. OPEC provided 60.9 percent of American imports in 1990, up from 57.8 percent in 1989, despite the unavailability of Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude oil in the second half of last year, it said.
 
'There's Nothing Secure'
 Ken Miller, an oil analyst at Purvin & Gertz, a Houston consulting firm, said, "We're obviously a little better off than we were with a guy armed to the teeth, like Saddam was." He added: "There's nothing secure over there. Any of those leaders can act up at any time."
Some experts say there are worse things than relying on the Saudis, who have argued for years on behalf of moderate prices, because the Saudi rulers appear persuaded that if prices get too high, customers turn to alternative fuels or invest in technology that will cut demand. In addition, the war created, for the first time, a substantial Saudi-American military alliance.
"It's hard to imagine right now the Saudis doing anything that would hurt the United States," said Howard S. Geller, the executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. But he said Saudi Arabia had internal strains and added, "I don't think anyone would want to bet that in five years or ten years we'll have the same situation."
 
Friend Lost in '79
 The oil shock of 1979, in which prices tripled, was set off by the collapse of the Shah of Iran, at the time the United States' closest and most powerful friend in the region, Mr. Geller pointed out.
But Mr. Zanoyan said that even if the war exposed strains within Saudi Arabia, the result could well be growing influence for young, Western-educated technocrats, a change that would not hurt oil production.
Since the Arab oil embargo of 1973, America's energy posture has grown more secure in some ways, more troublesome in others. The country is more secure because energy is now a smaller ingredient in the production of goods and services. The Department of Energy calculates that in 1990 producing $1 worth of goods and services required 39 percent less oil and gas than was needed in 1973. On the other hand, imports of crude oil and oil products are up by more than 16 percent. The reason is that domestic production has declined while total consumption in 1990 was roughly the same as in 1973.
 
Move Toward Efficiency Eases
 The trend toward greater energy efficiency in the United States seems to be ending, with most of the improvement having taken place before oil prices crashed in 1986. Last year, some analysts say, energy efficiency actually declined. Even though new equipment is generally more efficient than old equipment, new cars are growing less efficient. And there has been a revival of some industries, like steel, that are energy-intensive.
"We chose to attack an unfriendly oil-exporting country, instead of attacking energy waste," said Mr. Geller of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.
What would have been the impact on oil supplies if Saddam Hussein had held onto Kuwait?He might have used his control of its oil and the threat of his military might to push up world prices, and experts say the short-term impact on importing countries might have been severe.
But the longer-term effect would have been less so, they say, because imports would have gradually declined under the weight of higher prices, as was the case after the price shock of 1978-80.
"Over the longer term, it wouldn't have made a heck of a lot of difference," Dr. Gerry Angevine, the president of the Canadian Energy Research Institute, in Calgary, Alberta, said in a telephone interview.
The importance of Saudi Arabia's stability rises with American reliance on imports. The Department of Energy said net imports as a percentage of petroleum products sold in this country rose from 34.8 percent in 1973, the time of the Arab oil embargo, to 43.1 percent in 1979, the time of the second oil shock. With high prices, demand was depressed and domestic production stimulated, so by 1985 imports were down to 27.3 percent. But by last year, imports were back up to 41.9 percent.
 
Prices and Consumption
 Charles J. DiBona, president of the American Petroleum Institute, the industry's main trade association, predicted, "Unless we have a very sharp increase in prices, consumption will rise and U.S. production will continue a downward trend."
Crude oil production was more than 9 million barrels a day in 1973, but for the first quarter of this year it was less than 7.5 million. Demand in the first quarter was about 16.7 million but would rise sharply with an economic recovery, experts say.
The difference is made up by imports, which have have grown quickly. But since the world's spare capacity is in the Persian Gulf, reliance on the Middle East has grown even faster. Imports from Arab members of OPEC accounted for 13.2 percent of American supplies last year, compared with 5.3 percent in 1973.
Yet amid the euphoria of victory over Iraq, those numbers have generated little concern. In 1973, Congress was galvanized by the Arab oil embargo and approved construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, through which about one-fourth of American production now flows, Mr. DiBona said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Narrow Trading in Dollar As Reports Are Awaited

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar closed mixed in narrow trading yesterday as currency specialists awaited the trade and economic reports scheduled for later this week. Gold was higher.
On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold gained $1.10 an ounce, closing at $368.20. A late bid at the Republic National Bank in New York placed gold at $367.60 an ounce, up 85 cents from late on Friday. 
 With no significant economic developments, currency trading responded to technical factors, analysts said. A similar trend surpressed activity in the stock and bond markets.
 
'Just Waiting'
 "Everybody's just waiting," said Andrew Busch, a trader for Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago. "There will be somewhat of a wait-and-see until we get the trade number and the tan book," he added, referring to the Commerce Department's report on merchandise trade activity in April and the Federal Reserve's survey of economic activity, known as the "beige book." Both reports are scheduled for later this week.
Michael Schaufler, a senior trader for the Bank of Boston, said some traders and investors were nervous about the possibility that the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, might intervene to support the mark.
The dollar benefited from trades between German marks and British pounds, which sent the German currency lower. Political uncertainty in Britain undermined the pound, dealers said.
In London, the pound fell to $1.6258, from $1.6395 late on Friday. In New York, it cost $1.6265 to buy a pound, less expensive than the $1.6325 late on Friday.

HEADLINE: Kuwait Picks Airbus to Rebuild Fleet

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, June 17

 BODY:
Kuwait's national airline announced today that it had decided to rebuild its fleet by awarding orders to Airbus Industrie for 15 aircraft and by taking options on nine more Airbus planes, a deal that analysts said was worth almost $2 billion.
At a news conference at the Paris Air Show, Ahmed al-Mishari, chairman of the Kuwaiti Airways Corporation, also announced that his company would soon order three Boeing 747-400 aircraft. 
 In a separate announcement at the air show, the McDonnell Douglas Corporation disclosed plans to build a new 105-seat passenger aircraft that would be assembled in China.
 
G.E. Engine Award
 The Kuwaiti deal with Airbus would also award jet engine contracts to the General Electric Company and to CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric and Snecma, a French engine maker.
Mr. Mishari said, "We lost about two-thirds of our fleet during the Iraqi invasion, and lost most of our maintenance facilities, engine workshops -- the whole thing." Kuwaiti Airways officials said that during the war Iraqi forces stole 15 aircraft -- 8 Airbuses, 3 Boeing aircraft and 4 smaller executive jets.
Many Europeans feared after the Persian Gulf war that Kuwait would give Americans preference in rebuilding the country. The Europeans pointed out that they, too, had sent troops to fight for Kuwait, and since then, Kuwait has awarded many contracts to European concerns. Airbus shareholders are the British, French, German and Spanish aircraft makers.
The order announced today involved three Airbus A320 short-to-medium-range aircraft, which have 150 seats; five wide-body, medium-range A300-600R's with 260 seats; three 210-seat, medium-to-long-range A310-300's, and four long-range A340-200's, which have 260 seats.
Airbus has scheduled a news conference for Tuesday at which it is expected to announce that the Federal Express Corporation is awarding it 25 firm orders and 50 options for converted A300 cargo planes.
In the McDonnell Douglas development, the St. Louis-based company said it had signed memorandums of understanding for the new passenger aircraft, to be called the MD-95, with the China National Aero-Technology Import-Export Corporation and with the Pratt & Whitney division of the United Technologies Corporation. The new plane will replace McDonnell's DC-9's.
McDonnell Douglas has produced its MD-82 aircraft in China since the mid-1980's. Company officials said they had begun designing the MD-95, which would be company's smallest twinjet and they hoped it would start commercial service in 1994.
McDonnell Douglas officials said they had also signed a memorandum of understanding with Northwest Airlines for the airline to evaluate the new aircraft. Northwest has 142 DC-9's, giving it the world's largest fleet of such aircraft.
 
Common Features With DC-9
 The MD-95, which will complete with the Boeing Company's 737-300 aircraft, will have many common features with the DC-9. Company officials say they hope this will help airlines economize in maintenance, pilot training and replacement parts.
John Wolf, a McDonnell Douglas executive vice president, said his company hoped to reach final agreement with the Chinese late this year. McDonnell Douglas is moving an increasing amount of production to China with the goal of becoming one of the world's lowest-cost aircraft manufacturers.
Alto today, ITT Defense, a subsidiary of the ITT Corporation, announced that it was forming a 50-50 joint venture with Thomson-CSF, the French electronics group, to make radar systems for American airports.
The joint venture hopes to capture contracts that the Federal Aviation Administration plans to award to upgrade or replace up to 100 radar systems. In addition, the Department of Defense plans to award contracts to modernize or replace 60 systems. Each system will cost about $2.7 million, an ITT official said.

HEADLINE: Victorious Yeltsin Due in U.S. Today

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 17

 BODY:
Boris N. Yeltsin begins a three-day visit to Washington on Tuesday that confronts President Bush with basic questions about American attitudes toward the rapidly changing Soviet Union, which has been the focus of United States foreign policy for 45 years.
The root question is this: Can Washington find some way to support Mr. Yeltsin and rapid change without undermining President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and stability? Andrei Kozyrev, one of Mr. Yeltsin's close associates, suggested at a news conference last week that Mr. Yeltsin would tell Mr. Bush that Russia was ready to pursue both goals at once, "to achieve stability through broadening radical economic reforms." 
 Victor in the first popular election in Russia's 1,000-year-history, Mr. Yeltsin arrives here as the President of a Russian Republic that stretches across 11 time zones from the Baltic to the Pacific. It has a larger population than any other part of the Soviet Union and commands nine-tenths of its oil and more than three-quarters of its natural gas reserves.
Mr. Yeltsin is a non-Communist decentralizer, who wants to shift power and the taxing authority away from Moscow; Mr. Gorbachev is a Communist centralizer who wants to preserve Moscow's dominance. It is a debate not unlike that which split the United States in the last century.
 
Yeltsin in U.S. in 1989
 Mr. Yeltsin's previous visit to the United States, in September 1989, was marked by thinly disguised official indifference. He stopped at the White House, where he met with Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser, but not the President.
Until now Washington, and especially Mr. Bush, have felt that they must cling to Mr. Gorbachev, partly because they admire what he has done so far, partly because they saw nothing but a slide into the abyss without him. Now Mr. Yeltsin poses a genuine alternative -- one endorsed by the masses, as Mr. Gorbachev has not been, and one more committed, in word if not yet entirely convincingly in deed, to American ideas of democracy.
Officially, this week's visit is sponsored by Congressional leaders, and Mr. Yeltsin is to spend Wednesday largely on Capitol Hill.
But on Thursday he will be given the full treatment by the Administration, meeting with Mr. Bush in the Oval Office, with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher and with Vice President Dan Quayle.
Only Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d is missing from the list, and he is out of town, talking about the future of Europe in Berlin.
 
Reconciliation With Gorbachev?
 The White House seems to have concluded that Mr. Gorbachev's recent rapprochement with Mr. Yeltsin is real, not merely tactical. Mr. Bush will be looking for confirmation of that in the talks. Some in the Administration are skeptical, and a senior White House official said last week, "It will be tricky for the President, trying to give Yeltsin his blessing without undercutting Gorbachev's turn back toward reform."
"What we hope we can do," another Presidential aide said, "is give Yeltsin every indication of American approval, and at the same time encourage Gorbachev to tell the Soviet right-wingers, 'I've got to move on this reform agenda, or you'll get Yeltsin, which you'll like even less.' "
Another Government Soviet specialist, who like the others asked that he not be identified, said the United States could not "afford to put all its eggs in Gorbachev's basket, because Yeltsin might be the boss one day."
Mr. Bush talked briefly today on the subject of Soviet relations, telling reporters as he flew from Los Angeles to Grand Junction, Colo., that work on a strategic arms treaty was "96 percent complete." Agreement on such a treaty, the Administration has maintained, is a prerequisite for a summit meeting originally scheduled for late this month.
The President said he had received a "very important" letter from Mr. Gorbachev over the weekend on strategic arms-control issues. Although he described the remaining issues as "highly technical," he said, "The tone was good and the determination to reach an agreement was positive."
"I would say it's a narrowing of differences," Mr. Bush added. "But I do think that some of the differences that remain are fairly difficult."
 
Issue of Summit Meeting
 White House and State Department officials have said in recent days that a meeting between the two Presidents is unlikely late this month or even next month, after Mr. Bush's trip to London for the annual conference of the seven major industrialized nations and subsequent visits to Greece and Turkey. But the President insisted that he was still holding both periods open for a trip to Moscow should a breakthrough suddenly develop in the arms talks.
"I don't want to get hopes up," Mr. Bush said of the possibility of an early meeting, "but I really want to have it."
The President said nothing about the Yeltsin visit, which will include a full complement of appearances on American television and conversations with American journalists. While Mr. Yeltsin is far less well known to the general public than Mr. Gorbachev, and thus unlikely to stir the popular frenzy that has marked the Soviet leader's trips here, he is a magnetic figure with a populist flair who is sure to attract wide publicity in the United States.
In addition to his appointments with leaders in the Administration and in Congress, Mr. Yeltsin is to meet labor leaders, give a reception at the Soviet Embassy and visit the Lincoln Memorial. Late Thursday afternoon he will fly to New York.

HEADLINE: White House Hopes to Lift Sanctions

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 17

 BODY:
After the South African Parliament's repeal of the last legal pillar of apartheid, senior Bush Administration officials said today that they would move ahead with plans to lift a five-year-old set of economic sanctions against South Africa by the end of the summer.
Mr. Bush's efforts to lift the sanctions are almost certain to set off an effort in Congress to retain them by several lawmakers, who say that South Africa has not yet earned their repeal. 
 President Bush, the officials said, is confident that swift movement by President F. W. de Klerk to dismantle the legal apparatus of apartheid, the system of institutionalized racial separation, has largely defused American sentiment to continue to exert pressure on the South African Government. The law by which all South Africans are classified by race at birth, repealed by vote of the South African Parliament today, was the last of several eliminated in the last year that formed the legal basis of apartheid.
A senior Administration official said that the vote fulfilled four of the five conditions in the 1986 anti-apartheid law that would allow the President to lift sanctions. When the remaining condition, the release of all political prisoners is satisfied, possibly in a month's time, the official said, the United States will be morally obligated to lift the sanctions.
 
A Contract With Pretoria?
 "There is a strong feeling here that the law represents a contract," the official went on, "and when they fulfill the contract, we have to act accordingly."
But the Congressional Black Caucus and anti-apartheid lobbies are demanding that the sanctions be continued until a new constitution giving South African blacks the right to vote is in place, although that is not a condition of the 1986 act. Under the law, which was enacted over President Ronald Reagan's veto, Congess has 30 days to challenge a lifting of the sanctions, which have prohibited new investments and most trade with South Africa.
"We feel it's very important not to lift sanctions now until we're certain the situation in South Africa is irreversible," said Representative Edolphus Towns, Democrat of Brooklyn, who is the current chairman of the 28-member black caucus. Mr. Towns said that continued sanctions are needed to keep pressure on Pretoria.
 
Opposition in Congress
 Others legislators, such as Representative Howard Wolpe, Democrat of Michigan, chairman of the House subcommittee on Africa, have disputed the Administration's contention that four out of the five conditions in the 1986 law have been fulfilled.
Senator Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana, who was influential in enacting the original sanctions law, said such an approach would be unfair. He also likened the law to a contract and said that retaining sanctions until a new condition like full voting rights is met would be "like moving the goalposts."
Mr. Lugar said he was confident that President Bush would have enough votes to veto any initiative to restore sanctions because most Americans and both houses of Congress admire Mr. de Klerk's efforts and no longer believe sanctions are necessary.
President Bush is certain to use the visit to the White House later this week by Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi, to bolster his argument against maintaining the sanctions. Chief Buthelezi, the South African leader of the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party, has been feuding with the African National Congress headed by Nelson Mandela over the issue of sanctions, among other things.
 
City and State Measures
 Even if Federal Government sanctions are lifted, scores of state, city and county governments have imposed their own economic penalties, and these restrictions are not dependent on whatever is done in Washington. At least 90 cities, including New York, and eight states, have some form of legislation authorizing their officials to impose sanctions on companies that do business in South Africa.
In some ways, the local laws have been at least as effective as Federal law in discouraging companies from maintaining business ties with South Africa.
This spring, J. P. Morgan & Company, the investment banker, said it would no longer handle special securities representing stock in South African companies. Although the practice was not forbidden by the law, the company said the practice was "increasingly viewed in a negative light."
The 1986 act allowed companies that already had investments in South Africa to remain there and, according to the Washington-based Investor Responsibility Research Center, there are 104 American companies still doing business in South Africa. Allison Cooper of the center, said that since the act was passed in 1986, more than 200 companies have ended their ties to South Africa.
 
South African Envoy's Comments
 Harry Schwarz, the South African Ambassador to the United States, said today that he believed there was no longer a public demand in America to maintain sanctions against his Government.
Mr. Schwarz, a former South African opposition legislator who fought apartheid in Parliament, derided those Americans who he said "want to keep sanctions alive at any price."
He said the process of change is irreversible no matter what happens with sanctions but that their repeal is needed to help South Africa recover its economic vitality.
The condition under the 1986 law that is the focus of the most dispute is the release of all political prisoners. The South African Government, which has released about 1,000 political prisoners, maintains that it has fulfilled its obligation, but the African National Congress, its principal adversary, says there are still hundreds in jail who should be freed.
The two sides are negotiating over individual cases, and the State Department has ordered William Lacy Swing, the United States Ambassador to Pretoria, to report on the situation in a few weeks.
A senior State Department official said that many countries in Africa are privately eager for sanctions to be ended so they may trade openly with South Africa, the economic giant of the continent.
To that end, President de Klerk has traveled to 10 African countries and solicited their support. In Kenya earlier this month, he expressed hope that South Africa might be admitted to the Organization of African Unity. The continent-wide group recently said it would soon reconsider its stand on sanctions against South Africa.

HEADLINE: A Livable City? Newark. Yes, Newark.

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
This sounds like monologue material for Johnny or Dave or Arsenio: Newark, once a symbol of old-fashioned industrial might and later of urban unrest and disintegration, won an award yesterday in a competition to choose America's most livable cities.
Newark. Livable. Really. 
 The Unites States Conference of Mayors announced this at its annual meeting in San Diego, commending Newark for a "true renaissance." It noted that Newark was getting its first new theater in 50 years and had its first new shopping center in 20, along with hundreds of town houses for low- and moderate-income residents. This not the only prize to come Newark's way lately. Just last week, Newark was designated an All-America City by the National Civic League, and Newark has won a shelf of trophies for a recycling program that uses tires in making pavement for roads. The method Newark uses has attracted worldwide attention. A delegation from the Soviet Union spent a week in Newark studying it.
 
Still Serious Problems
 All this for a city that used to be laughed off in the same breath as Detroit, which like Newark was scarred by riots in the 1960's, or Cleveland, where the Mayor once set his hair on fire at a ribbon-cutting ceremony.
"There's an old saying -- when you face a mass of problems, if they don't kill you, you'll be better off," Mayor Sharpe James of Newark said last week. "We faced the riots, where most people's image even today is one of Newark burning and National Guard troops marching up and down the street."
Newark still has the serious problems of any big city: crime and the perception of crime, drugs and AIDS.
 Unemployment stood at 12.6 percent in February, the most recent month for which the Bureau of Labor Statistics has compiled figures. That was up from 10.2 percent in the same month of 1990, and well above the seasonally adjusted national rate. At the same time, Newark's popula tion has been shrinking. Estimated at 315,196 in 1988, the figure was down to 275,221 in the 1990 census.
In talking about Newark's recent success in getting new construction projects going, Mayor James uses the old real-estate cliche -- "location, location, location." Newark, though, is profiting from more than being in the right place at an opportune time; the Mayor might just as well say transportation, transportation, transportation.
Newark has the nation's fastest-growing airport and its largest port for container ships, along with a train station that serves as an anchor for many of the new buildings downtown. And Newark may well become one of the few cities in the nation whose airport is reachable by rail: the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is spending $350,000 to study linking a planned people-mover system at the airport to the Northeast Corridor rail lines.
 
'Beautiful Downtown Newark'
 "Newark is so much more accessible," said Pamela Goldstein, an aide to Mayor James. "I don't want to take a potshot at New York or anything, but it's much easier to get goods in and out of Newark."
Michael Zimmer, the associate dean of the Seton Hall University Law Center, remembers arriving in Newark in 1978 and deciding that "it was a pretty dispirited place."
"Then," he said, "it was pure irony when someone said 'beautiful downtown Newark.' If you fly around Newark now in a helicopter, you would see the coming together of a viable urban environment." Mr. Zimmer suggests a helicopter because he finds the traffic increasingly snarled in the downtown area where the law school's new home is scheduled to open this year.
The streets may get more clogged as new buildings open. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New Jersey plans to move 2,400 employees from a campus-like complex in suburban Florham Park to a Newark office tower. New Jersey Transit is expected to occupy an adjacent building. And the $200 million New Jersey Performing Arts Center is planned for the block behind Seton Hall's new law school.
 
Public and Private Investment
 Some urban experts say awards like the ones Newark has been winning lately may go to cities that pay as much attention to municipal marketing as to municipal development. But most agree that Newark has made progress.
"The secret to Newark is many years of public investment are now yielding a harvest," said Mitchell Moss of the Urban Research Center and New York University. Tax abatements and other government incentives are credited with making some new projects economically attractive. And a small number of downtown corporations -- among them Prudential Insurance, Public Service Electric and Gas, First Fidelity Bank and New Jersey Bell -- have put a large amount of money into building new buildings.
"Mayor James has been doing well, but it's like trying to push a boulder up a hill," said Norman J. Glickman, director of the Center for Urban Policy Research at Rutgers University in New Brunswick. "He's gotten halfway up the hill, but whether he'll get to the top remains to be seen."
Other planners are more skeptical of a Newark renaissance.
"It flies in the face of secular reality," said George Sternlieb, who founded the center Mr. Glickman now runs. "The secular reality is a city that still is essentially dependent upon welfare and on the flow of funds from the county, the state and the Feds." Newark used to have 20 percent of the job base of the entire state, he said, but now has no more than 5 or 6 percent.
Mr. James said he was not sweeping the city's problems under the rug. "We're talking about a window of opportunity," he said last week after winning the All-America City prize. "We have an award that says, 'Hey, Newark, we recognize where you were, we recognize your progress.' And that's what we accept this as -- not as an ending but a beginning to do more."
One thing that some residents say Newark must do to clinch the city's transformation is to reach beyond downtown, with its new elevated walkways connecting the buildings near Pennsylvania Station.
"People who come into Newark never set foot on Newark soil," said Mary Smith, the treasurer of New Community, a nonprofit group that built the new shopping center. "We need more things in the neighborhoods to benefit the neighborhoods."
And the livability award? In San Diego yesterday, Kay Scrimger of the Conference of Mayors said that Newark was chosen from among 117 cities "not for intrinsic livability but for purposeful actions in developing programs that promote livability." In other words, she said, the award goes to a mayor who has done something to make his city livable, not necessarily to one whose city already is. She said the prize was a black crystal sculpture, "like something out of 'Star Wars.' "
Newark clearly hopes it will get publicity from its recent awards -- and it probably won't get too much of the kind it does not need. Steve O'Donnell, the head writer on "Late Night With David Letterman," said that in nearly 10 years he could not remember putting a Newark joke on the air.
"We'll make a Cleveland Indians joke sometimes," said Mr. O'Donnell, who grew up in Cleveland, "but not Newark, maybe since we're playing to a nationwide audience. Newark may be more of a tristate-area joke than a nationwide joke."

HEADLINE: 6,000 New York City Workers Get Layoff Notices

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE

 BODY:
Gregory Vann, a Brooklyn sanitation worker with three children, had fretted for weeks over the possibility of losing his job. When he walked into a New York City sanitation garage yesterday morning, fellow workers told him he was "on the list," meaning that he was one of the thousands of city employees being laid off by the end of the month.
"I've got babies, man," Mr. Vann said to an unmarried colleague who was also told he was being laid off but said he was not overly concerned. "You never had a little kid come to you and say, 'I'm hungry.' " 
 The troubles facing Mr. Vann were played out in city agencies throughout New York yesterday as the first 6,000 city workers were informed that they would be laid off by June 29 to save money in a time of fiscal desperation.
Workers like Mr. Vann are caught in the middle as the city and the unions square off in an 11th-hour countdown to balance the budget, which now has a $3.5 billion gap for the fiscal year that starts on July 1. The city has threatened to go through with the layoffs if they do not get the concessions they seek from union leaders, who in turn assert that they must protect their members.
 By Thursday, a total of 7,969 city employees in 24 agencies and departments are to receive dismissal slips, said Denise Collins, a spokeswoman for the city's Personnel Department.
Although measures like employee attrition and early retirement could save some money and avert some layoffs, city officials said they were holding out for a package that included larger permanent savings like changes in work rules, staffing levels, vacation days or health benefits. Without the threat of layoffs, they say, the unions would have little incentive to make other concessions.
The widespread layoffs are part of Mayor David N. Dinkins's efforts to put pressure on the unions to come up with money-saving concessions to help close the budget gap.
Neither city officials nor union leaders have said precisely what the dollar value of the concessions under discussion was, or precisely what their favored means of achieving them would be. But hundreds of millions in savings are being sought.
Mr. Dinkins said at a news conference yesterday that he hoped some of the layoffs could still be averted through union concessions. "It is very possible we could reach an agreement before these people are off the payroll," he said.
Mr. Vann was one of the thousands of workers told a month ago that his job was in danger, but like many others he remained optimistic to the end. Yesterday was the beginning of the end as the bad news went out by office teletype, by letter or in a meeting with a supervisor.
 
Hardest-Hit Agencies
 Some of the agencies hit the hardest include the Sanitation Department, with 940 layoffs; the Human Resources Administration, with 2,416; the Parks Department, with 1,321, and the Health Department, with 1,380.
Yesterday's layoffs were the culmination of a process that started months ago when most city agencies received budget-cutting targets and began singling out job titles and programs for elimination. The unions were notified of the intentions and given an opportunity to review or challenge the decisions. About a month ago, union leaders told their members who had been targeted that they were "at risk." Civil Service employees also received a similar at-risk letter.
Most of the layoffs were done on the basis of seniority and the process is certain to be complicated with seniority disputes. Some workers are hoping to be rehired later or hired for another job or in another agency.
Mr. Vann, who is 36 years old and has been a sanitation worker for 11 months, found little consolation yesterday in the hope of being rehired. He said he was angry that while the city was using layoffs to save money, financial pressures would come other ways as people filed for unemployment and welfare benefits and as higher-paid workers with more seniority continued to collect paychecks. City officials estimate that the unemployment benefits alone for the laid-off workers will cost the city about $55 million a year.
"There is a guy who has been here for 35 years and he's putting his grand-kids through college," said Mr. Vann, his eyes moist behind brown aviator glasses. "College! My kid is graduating from kindergarten and I have to figure out a way to buy him some new shoes."
Mr. Vann said he only took home $330 a week, but it put food on the table in his home in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn. Now, with no marketable skills and no college degree, and with an estranged wife who is unemployed, all he has left are his pride and his wits to figure out his next move.
Ronald Princeton, a muscular 37-year-old with his hair tied back in a ponytail, drives a mechanical broom truck for the Sanitation Department. He gets up early for the 7 A.M.-to-3 P.M. shift, but yesterday he looked tired before the day had ended because he was being laid off after 20 months on the job.
"It's a hardship," Mr. Princeton said. "I have four children. My wife is unemployed. I take home $370 a week. "There is nothing I can do but look for another job and collect unemployment, if possible," said Mr. Princeton, who lives in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn. "It's going to be an uphill struggle -- that's all I can say. My family's going to take it hard."
Tom Cartelli, an unmarried mechanical broom operator from Staten Island, said he felt sorry for the married men. As of June 28, Mr. Cartelli will be out of a job too, but he is counting on his skills as an electrician to help him over the rough spots.
"I tell you, I'm not happy, but it's really sad for the guys with families," said Mr. Cartelli, who is 26 years old. "I've never been on unemployment in my life. I've never been in that line. I've never been in that building."
In a letter that will sooner or later find its way into the hands of all employees due to be laid off, the city says it will provide re-employment sessions to discuss unemployment insurance benefits, retraining, education and non-city employment opportunities.
Of the three men gathered in the Sanitation Department garage yesterday, only Mr. Cartelli said he could afford health insurance, at a cost of about $100 a month for single people and more than $300 for people with dependents.
"I can't even buy what I want in the grocery store," Mr. Vann said glumly.
The layoffs were cited by union leaders yesterday as they denounced the Mayor's doomsday budget that includes plans to close libraries and turn off street lights.
"The city administration is going to learn quickly that sanitation services, just like police and fire services, are essential to the health and well-being of our citizens," said Edward Ostrowski, president of the Uniformed Sanitationmen's Association. He called the layoffs "a human tragedy."
Stanley Hill, executive director of District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Muncipal Employees, whose members will account for the bulk of the layoffs, sent the Mayor a telegram urging him to bring union, business and state and city political leaders together to reach agreement on taxes and union contributions to balance the budget.
"We need leadership, your leadership," Mr. Hill told the Mayor. "Don't let midnight toll without a solution. The city can't afford it. My members can't afford it. I can't afford it and you can't afford it."

HEADLINE: U.N. Punishes Iraq Further for Kuwait Invasion

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, June 17

 BODY:
The Security Council tightened its sanctions against Iraq today by unanimously approving a detailed plan for denying Baghdad military supplies and declaring that it must pay for the destruction of its most dangerous weapons itself.
At the same time, the special commission set up by the Council to supervise the destruction of the weapons announced that it would send inspectors back to Iraq later this week to look for evidence that the Government of President Saddam Hussein is secretly trying to build nuclear warheads. 
 The commission's executive chairman, Rolf Ekeus of Sweden, ordered the new inspection after receiving information about Iraq's clandestine nuclear plans from an Iraqi scientist who recently defected to the United States.
Mr. Ekeus said the decision reflected new information as well as "further analysis" of material brought back from the inspection in May by experts from the commission and the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency, which is charged with removing all nuclear material usable in weapons from Iraq.
Under the arms embargo plan approved by the Security Council today, all countries must report to the Secretary General within 45 days the steps they have taken to insure their citizens and corporations do not supply Iraq with any military materiel, including technology and machinery that could be used for military purposes.
 
Liable for 'Full Costs'
 The Council committee set up to monitor the rest of the trade sanctions against Iraq will be responsible for overseeing the arms embargo and for ruling on disputed points.
The Council also unanimously declared that Iraq remained liable for the "full costs" of destroying its chemical and biological weapons, its ballistic missiles and its nuclear material usable in weapons. The Secretary General is to propose a plan for collecting this money, estimated in the hundreds of millions of dollars, from Iraq.
Iraq's acting representative, Samir K. K. al-Nima, told the Council that his Government refused to pay for destroying its weapons of mass destruction, but was willing to do the task itself under United Nations supervision.
Today's decisions mean that the institutional structure devised by the Security Council for punishing Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait is almost complete.
Later this week the Council is expected to define the duties of the special council it is creating in Geneva to assess compensation claims against Iraq and pay them from the country's future oil revenue once the Security Council allows Baghdad to resume selling oil on the world market.

Kuwait's 13th Death Sentence
 KUWAIT CITY, June 17 (AP) -- A 55-year-old Jordanian woman, Hamda Assad Younis, was sentenced to death today for collaboration with Iraq because during the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait she failed to close the girls' high school she ran and also edited material for an Iraqi-run newspaper. She is the 13th person sentenced to death by the special martial-law court trying those accused of collaboration.

HEADLINE: Members of U.S. Panel at Odds Over Health Insurance for Children

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 17

 BODY:
Dissent has boiled up inside a Federal commission investigating the condition of children in America, with Bush Administration officials and other Republicans assailing Democratic proposals to extend health insurance coverage to more than eight million uninsured children.
The Republican attack, which came in a dissenting chapter of a report to be issued next week, suggested that it would be almost impossible for Congress and the Administration to reach agreement soon on any comprehensive revision of the nation's health care system. 
 In the report, a copy of which was obtained today, a majority on the panel, the National Commission on Children, called for a sweeping new program of "universal health insurance for children and pregnant women." Under the proposal, employers would have to provide health insurance for employees and their children or pay a new tax to finance such coverage under a public program.
 
Dissent on Potential Cost
 In the dissenting chapter, 9 of the 34 members denounced the commission proposal, saying it would lead to "skyrocketing health costs and health care of poorer quality."
Moreover, the dissenters said in the report that the proposed new requirements meant that "low-wage workers -- the same ones most likely to lack health insurance -- would lose jobs or see their wages reduced." The Republicans estimate that 500,000 to 1.4 million workers could lose their jobs because employers might dismiss employees rather than finance added benefits. They said, "These families might consider a job to be more valuable than a Federal Government health plan."
In interviews today, Democrats on the commission, headed by Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th, rejected that argument as unconvincing.
And although commissioners had fundamental differences on health care, they agreed on many other issues, including education and strategies to combat poverty.
The commission proposal on health care is like one introduced June 5 by Senate Democrats including Mr. Rockefeller and George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader. The legislation goes beyond the commission proposal by guaranteeing health insurance protection for all adults as well as children.
The dissenters on the commission include Wade F. Horn, the Federal Commissioner for Children, Youth and Families; Gerald P. Regier, acting director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance at the Justice Department; Allan C. Carlson, president of the Rockford Institute, in Illinois; Kay C. James, a former Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services, and Nancy Risque Rohrbach, a former aide to President Ronald Reagan.
The attack on the Rockefeller commission proposal echoes criticism from two other influential Republicans. On Sunday, John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, defended President Bush's record on child welfare and health care and twitted the Democrats. "The Democrats would love to see a socialized structure in health care, and no agenda on health care is going to satisfy their commitment to socializing health care until it meets" that standard, Mr. Sununu said on the ABC News program "This Week."
 
Democrats Favor a Mix
 Democratic supporters of the Mitchell bill generally shun the concept of socialized medicine and say they want to preserve a mix of private and public health insurance.
But Bob Dole of Kansas, the Senate Republican leader, said the Mitchell-Rockefeller proposal would impose "a heavy tax on jobs" by adding to payroll costs and could lead to a Government monopoly on health care. In theory, he said, it would encourage more employers to offer health insurance to employees. But in practice, he warned, "many American companies may quickly grow frustrated and simply shed the burden by pressing the Government to take over completely."
The spirited response by Republicans suggests that Democrats are in for a fight if, as expected, they pummel Mr. Bush and other Republicans as lacking a domestic agenda in the 1992 Presidential campaign. Mr. Rockefeller and another commission member, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, are potential candidates for the Democratic Presidential nomination.
A confidential draft of the final Rockefeller commission report said the panel's proposals, taken together, would cost "$52 billion to $56 billion in new Federal funds in the first year," including $9 billion for health care. The biggest single item is a proposed Federal income tax credit of $1,000 for each child. The tax credit proposal, endorsed by commissioners from both parties, would cost $40 billion in the fiscal year 1993, the panel said.
 
Democrats on the Critics
 Commenting on the Republicans' chapter on health care, Senator Rockefeller said it had "not received the same careful independent factual and editorial review" as the rest of the report.
In a joint statement, two Democratic commissioners, Barbara B. Blum of New York and Ruth W. Massinga of Seattle, said the chapter was "based more on ideological conviction than on economic theory and solid empirical evidence."
The chapter emphasized "individual responsibility, rather than government programs" as the best solution to the nation's health problems. The dissenters suggested that "unwed parenthood" was a primary cause of infant mortality because single pregnant women and single mothers were less likely to seek the health care that they and their babies needed.
The statement by Mrs. Blum and Ms. Massinga said, "We are astounded by the causal link alleged between marital status and health conditions."

HEADLINE: Fast Start Replaces a Limp In Some Views of Recovery

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
The economic recovery that almost everyone thought would start with a crawl could begin with a dash instead, according to a growing minority of forecasters, including Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.
But a fast start -- which Fed officials now describe as a reasonable, albeit an unlikely, possibility -- would not presage a sustained boom. 
 Still, some Fed officials are struck by the fact that business made sharp cuts in production as sales slid. "Clearly we've had some substantial inventory hits during the recession and in the current quarter," said Wayne Angell, a governor of the Fed. "At some point in time, when you take away a huge negative number, that tends to give you a rather significant rebound."
More than a month ago, some Wall Sreet firms began raising their forecasts of how much the gross national product would grow in the last half of this year and the first half of 1992. The G.N.P. is the total value of goods and services sold.
"When we realized how deep a hole we'd dug ourselves into," said Bruce Steinberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch & Company, referring to inventory cutbacks, "we realized we'd be digging out faster."
Just as efforts by businesses to cut production when sales decline can snowball into a recession, attempts to keep shelves filled when sales start to revive can give the economy a powerful kick. As a matter of arithmetic, reducing inventories subtracts from G.N.P. growth while inventory building adds to growth. Even merely trimming at a slower rate gives the economy a lift.
"There's a legitimate concern that industry is in better shape in this recession than usual, just like services are in worse shape," said Stephen S. Strongin, associate research director at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. "With one part of the economy in better shape than usual and one part worse, it depends on which you emphasize whether you worry about too much versus too little growth."
Last week's rash of economic reports made the possibility that the economy might shift directly into high gear seem more plausible, though hardly certain. Businesses reported that inventories in April were unusually lean, amounting to 1.5 months worth of sales, compared with the typical 1.65 to 1.75 months. At the same time, retail sales jumped and car buying picked up a bit.
Lean supplies and a pickup in sales make it more likely that businesses will trim inventories less in coming months. "An inventory kick like that is enough to produce a surge of real income growth next fall and winter," said Art Rolnick, research director at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. "That is especially true if inflation comes down, too. "
As business pumps up production, there should be gains in hours worked, payrolls and, consequently, income. If inflation edges down for a while, as it almost always does in the first months of a recovery, purchasing power would rise, too.
A spurt at the start of the recovery does not imply a lasting boom. "An inventory rebound doesn't last for more than a few quarters," Mr. Rolnick said. In other recoveries, economists at the First Boston Corporation report, the swing from inventory reduction to accumulation typically adds a percentage point to G.N.P. growth during the recovery's first year and almost nothing after that.
Most of the forces that kept growth sluggish before the recession are still around, two examples being well-stocked consumers and a shrinking military industry.
 
A Slower Pace
 "You are likely to get the normal cyclical dynamics, but on top of a very slow trend, " said Richard Rippe, chief economist at Dean Witter. What is more, any speedy start now would be modest by the standards of past recoveries. At most, this rebound might start with a couple of quarters of 4 to 5 percent growth, not the high-single-digits pace registered immediately after some previous recessions.
Fed officials hasten to add that a bouncy recovery is not being forecast by the Fed, though Mr. Greenspan said two weeks ago that "the probability of a stronger-than-expected recovery is rising slightly."
Mr. Strongin of the Chicago Fed said: "This recession has a different structure going in, and the recovery has a different structure coming out. Charting its course is especially difficult."
One of the biggest differences is that alert companies started paring inventories when recession began. In most other recessions, inventories kept piling up for at least one quarter before business brought production into line with slower sales. In the long and deep 1974-75 recession, for example, inventories rose for a year before companies cut production.
At a forecasters' conference last September, Mr. Greenspan a former business prognosticator, argued that "economic forecasting is really the art of identifying tensions and understanding how they will be resolved over the short to intermediate term."
When the economy is changing direction, the tension between sales and stocks on shelves and in storerooms -- which no one except forecasters or managers ever think much about -- can provide clues to the future.

HEADLINE: Disgruntled India;
The Voters Make Clear Their Discontent, Giving No Party a Majority in Low Turnout

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, Tuesday, June 18

 BODY:
The political map of India has been redrawn in the turbulent election of 1991, geographically and demographically. Traditional voting patterns have been upset as fewer voters than ever cast ballots in what is the world's most populous democracy and also one of the poorest of nations.
"I do not think our electorate is very clear about what it wants," said Ashis Nandy, a political scientist at the Center for the Study of Developing Societies in Delhi. "But the lesson of this election is that any party that has been in power has paid for it."
 
Congress Fares Badly in North
 By early this morning, with 320 of the 511 contested Parliament seats decided, the Congress Party had won 168 and was projected to win 210 to 215, well shy of the 256 it would need to form a government without a coalition partner. The Bharatiya Janata Party, the surging Hindu nationalist party, had won 73 seats and was projected to win 120. In third place, the Janata Dal coalition, which stirred controversy in championing Government affirmative action for lower castes, had won 24 seats. The rest of the decided seats went to smaller parties. 
 Denied a clear majority, the century-old Congress Party, in the throes of choosing a new candidate for Prime Minister after the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi, has been evicted from its strongholds among the poor, the Muslims and the upper castes in the northern states, and is now all but totally reliant on the support of allies in the south.
The Janata Dal coalition, which came to power under Prime Minister V. P. Singh in 1989 on a burst of enthusiasm for clean government and a break from one-party, one-family rule under Congress, now retains a significant presence in only three states, the heavily populated and important states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar in the north and Orissa, a smaller state in the east.
Other politicians who had backed Mr. Singh as part of his National Front coalition, only to split with him over his program to aid the most disadvantaged, are battling to carve out constituencies that will enable them to survive. Much of the intellectual middle class, which had asserted itself through the front, was stunned and disappointed when Mr. Singh's promises of modernization turned out to include an expanded affirmative action program for the poorest and weakest castes.
This energized middle class, so vocal and aggressive in the previous election, is now hard to find within the vote totals being tallied.
The question is, where did they go?
A lot of them, their hopes dashed, opted out of political activity. With 53 percent of eligible voters casting ballots, the 1991 election had the lowest turnout of any modern Indian election, although even this was similar to the turnout for recent United States presidential elections.
"People like us do not vote," said Mr. Nandy, the political scientist. "Only the lower ranks still have faith in the electoral system."
But parties representing the most underprivileged Indians did not fare too well either. The Bahujan Samaj, appealing to outcastes to use their numerical superiority and seize political power, is teetering on extinction.
The Bharatiya Janata Party, the new force representing Hindu revivalism and upper caste privilege in a country that is more than 80 percent Hindu, has become the most dynamic national political organization, and in the process is positioning itself as the next hope for that significant part of the Indian middle class that is both Hindu and higher caste.
The party has captured the country's most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, the home base of the dynasty of Jawaharlal Nehru and the source of all but one of India's Prime Ministers.
 
Behind the Party's Success
 Mr. Nandy said that the success of the Hindu party had a lot to do with its effectiveness in packaging some of its least attractive appeals to religious chauvinism in the language of nationalism and equality, though equality is oftened defined as the phasing out of minority rights.
The party, however, also lost ground in states where it had been voted to power a scant year ago, raising questions about whether its success can be sustained.
The only exception to the "toss the rascals out" rule in this election seemed to be the support shown in the state of West Bengal for the Communist Party of India-Marxist, the larger of two Communist organizations. There, Chief Minister Jyoti Basu, in power for 14 years, obtained another term with a majority in the state assembly. The party was also leading in parliamentary contests.
The restless middle class has traditionally found other ways of gaining power, Mr. Nandy said, through control of news organizations and dominance of a vast Civil Service, among other methods. Many seem to feel that the overly centralized, openly corrupt political system only gets in the way of economic development.
A young clothing designer was bluntly direct. "Politicians are all jerks," he said. "There isn't any one of them competent to run this place. They are screwing up business."
 
Big Turnout of Women
 Mr. Nandy said that the failure of the Janata Dal was its inability to make its long-term development aims clear to the expanding middle class -- up to 150 million people out of more than 817 million -- whose traditional commitment has been to its own privileges in an overpopulated society where resources and jobs are scarce. Mr. Singh's affirmative action plan, which he calls essential to the social and economic growth of the nation, frightened and outraged many of them.
But politicians say that the poor performance of the Janata Dal coalition and the generally inconclusive verdict delivered by a skeptical electorate could also be explained by other factors without long-term implications.
Madhu Dandavate, Finance Minister in the Government of Prime Minister Singh and one of a lengthening list of former officials defeated in this election, said today in a television interview that in his Maharashtra constituency the turnout of women had been higher than of men. He said he believed that the women voted "from their hearts" for the party of the slain Mr. Gandhi.
A similar trend was observed in the southern state of Kerala, where a resilient Communist-led Government was wiped out in a Congress Party surge -- helped, apparently, by a large turnout of women and tacit help from the Bharatiya Janata Party, which knew it did not have much hope of penetrating the electorate on its own in a region remote from its northern power base.
Prannoy Roy, a political scientist and polling expert, said his data suggested that Congress benefited not so much from a "sympathy wave" after Mr. Gandhi's slaying as from a "re-energizing" of Congress supporters in response to the tragedy that had befallen the party.
 
Congress Seeking Allies
 Whether this modest resurgence of support for Congress is sustained, however, depends on the party's ability to choose the right prime ministerial candidate, the most effective coalition partner and the most vigorous program for dealing with an impending economic crisis in India.
Congress Party leaders have been phoning and meeting privately with officials of left-of-center parties as well as regional parties to gather the necessary majority in Parliament. A panel of two dozen Congress leaders is expected to name the party's parliamentary leader, and hence its choice for Prime Minister, in time for presentation to the party's legislators on Thursday.
After Mr. Gandhi's killing, the party leaders, seeking a sympathy vote and without a natural heir to the leadership, immediately turned to his widow, Sonia Gandhi, to ask her to take over. Mrs. Gandhi's rejection forced the party to turn at least temporarily to an ailing 70-year-old Brahmin, P. V. Narasimha Rao. Mr. Rao had faithfully served under Mr. Gandhi, who was Prime Minister from 1984 to 1989, and under his mother, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.

HEADLINE: Dow Drops 6.49, to 2,993.96; Trading Lags

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Stock prices moved narrowly yesterday in listless trading. With no significant news for traders to feed on, volume on the New York Stock Stock Exchange shrank to 134.2 million shares, from 169.3 million on Friday.
Because of the low volume, small losses among some blue-chip stocks were enough to trim the Dow Jones industrial average by 6.49 points, to 2,993.96. 
 "Aside from some profit taking after Friday's sharp advance, what we have is a stalemate because not enough people in the stock market believe interest rates have peaked," said Michael Metz, chief market strategist at Oppenheimer & Company. "We think last Friday's surge in bond prices was the turning point, but it apparently hasn't sunk in yet in the stock market."
 
Program Traders Sidelined
 In Mr. Metz's view, the relatively low amount of cash held by institutional investors is holding the stock market back. But it was the lack of liquidity, not cash, that kept the program traders on the sidelines. Birinyi Associates, which monitors program trading, found only one important buy and one sell program. The net result was to pare the Dow industrial averge by less than a point.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 2.16, to 380.13; the Big Board composite was off 0.96, at 208.38; the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.75, to 494.32, and the American Stock Exchange's market value index eased 0.23, to 367.13. There were 657 Big Board issues closing higher and 853 lower.
The fractional declines in blue-chip stocks that weighed down the Dow included a half-point dip in General Motors, to 43 3/4, and a 7/8 decline for I.B.M., to 99 1/2. G.M. was the second- most-active issue on the Big Board on a turnover of 1.65 million shares; I.B.M. was third with 1.63 million.
The most active was Computer Associates, which rose 1/2, to 10 7/8, on 2.3 million shares, much of which stemmed from 53 large blocks that changed hands.
 
Intel Up by 1 1/4, to 49 1/2
 As is often the case when the first-tier market is dull, secondary issues in the over-the-counter market drew investor attention. Intel, which was part of a generally weak semiconductor sector last week, stood out yesterday with a gain of 1 1/4, at 49 1/2.
Sun Microsystems lost 2 5/8, at 30 1/4, after a Goldman, Sachs analyst issued negative comments about the stock. But favorable comments about Novell Inc. by analysts at Smith Barney and Oppenheimer lifted the stock only temporarily.
After rising by 1 1/4, Novell closed up 3/4, at 50 3/4. Another well-regarded issue that gave up most of its gain was Costco Wholesale. After climbing well over two points on a sharp rise in earnings, it closed up by 3/4, at 42.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Ames Says Insolvency Is Almost Over

BYLINE: By ISADORE BARMASH

 BODY:
Ames Department Stores Inc., a leading discounter that filed for voluntary bankruptcy last year, told creditors yesterday that its fortunes had brightened sufficiently so that it could emerge from insolvency by the first half of 1992.
Ames said it expected to report a profit before taxes this year, compared with a loss for 1990. 
 Stephen L. Pistner, chairman and chief executive of Ames, said the company expected earnings before interest, taxes and expenses related to the bankruptcy filing to total $21.7 million this year, compared with 1990's loss of $317.2 million.
Speaking first to a creditor group and then at a news conference, Mr. Pistner said the 448-store company planned to improve sales by enhancing merchandise and increasing advertising at 124 urban "high impact" stores, those considered to have the highest sales potential. Ames also plans to place specialized departments like craft stores in 100 stores as well as create new jewelry and home furnishings departments.
 
Five-Year Plan
 The fiscal-year projections are part of a five-year plan the company said would be a framework for a reorganization plan that would be submitted to creditors.
Ames's five-year estimates call for profits before interest and taxes to rise to $129.1 million in the 1996 fiscal year, Mr. Pistner said. Current sales of $3.1 billion are expected to rise to $3.7 billion by that time, and profit margins are expected to grow seven-tenths of a percent, to 3.5 percent.
Mr. Pistner said that since Ames filed for bankruptcy protection in April 1990, the company had developed strategies to improve profitability, achieve consistent growth in comparable-store sales, reduce annual expense ratios and generate sufficient cash flow for investment in stores, support systems and operations.
But he also said Ames's sales from March through May were down slightly from the company's expectations, though same-store sales were higher. Because many Ames stores are in economically depressed New England, he said, the company had reduced its 1991 sales plan by $48 million because it did not expect the New England economy to turn around this year. Asked how Ames might be affected by the advance of Wal-Mart Stores Inc., based in Bentonville, Ark., into the North, he said: "We compete with 48 Wal-Marts now, and we've been able to blunt their openings. But we have figured a 15 percent downward effect in our five-year plan because of those expected new Wal-Marts."

HEADLINE: Kremlin Divided Over Economic Plan

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, June 17

 BODY:
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was reported today to have welcomed an unofficial plan by Soviet and American economists to integrate the country into the world market, while his Prime Minister dismissed it as a distraction.
Grigory A. Yavlinsky, the 39-year-old economist who brought the plan back from Harvard University over the weekend, presented it to Mr. Gorbachev today and found his reaction "fairly positive," he told the Soviet press agency, Tass. 
 Mr. Yavlinsky, who resigned as an adviser to Mr. Gorbachev last year, has no official connection to him any more, but remains on good terms with Mr. Gorbachev and Boris N. Yeltsin, the president of the Russian republic.
But Prime Minister Valentin S. Pavlov, telling the standing Soviet legislature about the Government's plans to try to halt the economic collapse, dismissed it as "a pretty piece of paper."
"I know a few gentlemen from Harvard University," he said. "They do not know our life. We can hardly expect them to explain everything to us." Mr. Pavlov was named by Mr. Gorbachev last winter to reassure those in the Communist Party who feared the consequences of too much change too fast.
The plan focuses in the short run on making the ruble convertible, privatizing small enterprises and getting the deficit under control.
Large-scale privatization of state enterprises, the establishment of financial and securities markets, and expansion of consumer goods and service would take place in later phases.
The plan was also presented to President Bush in Washington today, in advance of a seven-nation summit meeting of industrial democracies in London next month. The seven leaders will consider whether the West can help the Soviet transformation.
Mr. Gorbachev has accepted an invitation to address them after the summit meeting ends on July 17.
Soviet advocates of a shift toward a market economy say that Mr. Gorbachev was given a big push to move faster by the election last Wednesday of Mr. Yeltsin as President of the Russian Federation with 57.38 percent of the vote, on a platform of fundamental and rapid economic change.
Mr. Pavlov's remarks today were, therefore, not expected to have much effect on Mr. Gorbachev's views.
But several conservative Soviet legislators also criticized the Yavlinsky plan.
Viktor G. Kucherenko, chairman of the Parliament's committee on budget and finance, said it represented unwanted interference in the country's internal affairs.
"Russia has always attracted foreigners, but foreigners worked for our country and not the country for foreigners, as it is turning out now," he said.
In a 70-minute speech to the legislature, Mr. Pavlov said the Government would be seeking direct private foreign investment, instead of Western credits or loans, as it moves toward a market economy, at whatever speed.

HEADLINE: Experts Debate if AIDS Epidemic Has at Last Crested in U.S.

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA

 BODY:
IS the AIDS epidemic in the United States reaching its peak? Although only a few experts are willing to say it has, quite a number believe the question is at least worth discussing.
Ten years after the first cases were recognized, the disease is still untamed and has yet to do its worst in the rest of the world. But in the United States, it could be possible in the foreseeable future to declare the deadly tide on the ebb. 
 At the least, the estimate of the number of Americans infected with the AIDS virus keeps getting less gloomy. Two times in the past five years, the Centers for Disease Control has lowered its estimates, from 1.5 million infected Americans in 1986, to 1.3 million in 1987 to one million in 1988.
The Federal agency has stood pat on its one million figure, but its statisticians concede that the number of AIDS cases actually reported has been falling short of their predictions, meaning that they may have to adjust the numbers downward yet again. In contrast, AIDS cases are rising sharply in many developing countries, participants at an international conference in Florence, Italy, were told yesterday. [Page C3.]
In this country, it is still uncertain whether there is an independent AIDS epidemic among heterosexuals. Although the AIDS virus spreads heterosexually and the total of heterosexual AIDS cases is rising steadily, such cases still appear linked to the infected pool of intravenous drug abusers, meaning the epidemic has not yet taken on a life of its own among heterosexuals who do not use drugs. Some leading researchers say they seriously question whether such a heterosexual epidemic will ever flare in this country.
Some experts insist that the AIDS epidemic has peaked in the United States -- that this is as bad as it is going to get, at least in this country. By peaking, they mean that the number of newly diagnosed cases per year has reached its highest point, even though the cumulative total will continue to grow for some time. The epidemic would be better described in terms of the number of new infections per year, since these precede onset of the disease by up to 10 years, but for lack of information on infection patterns the number of cases is the only usable index.
Many who are uncertain whether the peak has yet arrived nonetheless agree with Sir David Cox, a statistician at Oxford University in England, who said, "It is fair to say that, on the whole, the predictions have been rather on the gloomy side, but things haven't worked out quite as badly."
Like everything else that touches on AIDS, the questions of where the epidemic is going and how fast it is moving are intensely debated.
No one discounts the cruel nature of the epidemic or the pain and devastation left by the virus as it brings a lingering death to people in the prime of life. And no one dismisses the truly horrifying surge in the number of cases over the decade. In 1981, 189 cases of AIDS were reported to the Centers for Disease Control. In 1990, 43,339 cases were reported. The question, however, is what is coming next.
AIDS is among the most difficult diseases researchers have ever tried to model. Researchers do not know how many people are infected with the virus but not yet ill, how likely infected people are to infect others or how treatments that may delay the onset of AIDS might have put a lag into the statistics. All these factors increase the uncertainty in the models.
Another complication is that the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta changed its list of conditions that mark a diagnosis of AIDS in 1988, adding dementia and a wasting syndrome to the list of conditions that already included disorders like Kaposi's sarcoma and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. This created a bulge in the number of AIDS cases, but the bulge had nothing to do with a true increase in the incidence of the disease.
At the centers, the agency's own epidemiologists and statisticians say they are uncertain whether the epidemic has reached a plateau.
Dr. Meade Morgan, chief of the centers' statistics branch, said he expected the epidemic would peak at different times in different groups. He said it was hard to say the worst had happened until things started getting better. "It is too early to say there has been a plateau in any population," he said. "Until the numbers actually peak and then begin to decline, there is no way of knowing."
But others say the peaks have already occurred, at least in some groups. Dr. Alexander Langmuir, a retired scientist who was chief epidemiologist at the disease control agency from 1949 to 1970, said the epidemic had passed its peak among homosexual men and was starting to peak in intravenous drug users. Dr. Langmuir said his conclusions were based on intensive study of reports from the disease agency on the numbers of AIDS cases. "My belief is that the AIDS epidemic in the U.S. has crested," he said.
Dr. Joel Hay, a health economist at Stanford University, agreed. Dr. Hay has drawn up a mathematical simulation of the epidemic, using the same method as the disease centers and the agency's own data. Dr. Hay works backward from the number of cases diagnosed in each period to the number of people who must earlier have been infected.
 
Uncertainty Over Estimates
 "Our calculations say that basically all the infections occurred prior to 1986," he said, meaning that in the early years of the epidemic, the virus spread rapidly in populations like gay men and intravenous drug users so that most people were exposed and many infected. Now, with so many people at high risk already infected and with many who are not infected taking precautions to avoid infections, fewer and fewer infections are occurring. "We think there are fewer than 30,000 new infections a year now and there could be as few as 10,000 new infections a year," he said.
Dr. Morgan said that estimates of the number of new infections were fraught with uncertainty but that, if pressed, he would say that there were 40,000 to 80,000 new infections a year in this country.
Dr. Hay calculates that 500,000 to 800,000 Americans are now infected with the AIDS virus. This is considerably lower than the 1988 estimate of the disease centers that a million Americans are infected.
Dr. Morgan, the chief of statistics at the disease centers, agreed that the figure of one million might be too high. Based on that figure, he said, he would expect more cases of AIDS than are being reported.
"The cases that we're seeing reported are falling at the lower end of what we predicted," Dr. Morgan said. In contrast, he said, just a few years ago, when the number of cases reported was increasing rapidly, the Centers for Disease Control was right on target in its estimates of how many cases would be reported each year. That leaves the statisticians with two alternatives.
Either the pool of infected people is being overestimated, Dr. Morgansaid, or new treatments like the drug AZT have had a large effect in prolonging the time between infection and the onset of AIDS, postponing the time when AIDS is diagnosed.
Dr. Morgan added that it was hard to estimate how many fewer people might be infected, if the treatment hypothesis proved incorrect. "It depends which model you're looking at," he said. But he said that it might be more like 700,000 than one million, which is a number that accords with Dr. Hay's estimate.
Dr. Morgan and his colleagues are now trying to incorporate in their models the effects of drugs that postpone the onset of AIDS and deaths from Pneumocystis pneumonia. If early treatment indeed accounts for the lower-than-expected number of AIDS cases, then there will be a surge in reported cases in the next year or so when those in whom disease was postponed become ill.
From the beginning of the AIDS epidemic, the public has been terrified that it could break out of the known risk groups and take on a life of its own. But some say it is looking increasingly less likely that that will happen.
Dr. Hay noted that he had seen no evidence that the AIDS virus had broken free from the gay and drug-using communities. Dr. Dennis Bregman, a statistician and epidemiologist at the University of Southern California, agreed.
"The disease is hard to transmit," he said. "You don't get it from casual contact." He said that most cases among heterosexuals could be attributed to other known risk factors like intravenous drug use or hemophilia. "You look at it and say, where is the heterosexual epidemic?"
Dr. Harold Jaffe, deputy director for science at the AIDS division of the disease centers, added that heterosexual transmission was more difficult than people expected. The virus spreads easily among intravenous drug users, crack addicts and their sexual partners, he said, but apparently not outside those groups. Among drug users, he stated, other factors, like genital ulcers and number of sexual partners, seem to make it more likely that the AIDS virus will take hold.
"In that sort of environment, we can have effective heterosexual transmission," he said. But it seems to be much less efficient in the rest of the heterosexual population, he added.
"Five or six years ago, people suggested that this will happen to the housewife in Cedar Rapids," he said.
But the statistics show "that is not the case," he added.

Quick Profits Unlikely For New Franchises

BYLINE: By Richard Sandomir

 BODY:
When the owners of the new Miami and Denver baseball franchises begin money talks with TV stations and regional sports cable channels in the coming weeks and months, they will not be entirely in the catbird seat.
Yes, there is plenty of euphoria in the two cities whose efforts paid off in their selection as the newest National League teams (pending the approval of major league owners). But euphoria is one of the worst moods in which to negotiate. 
 Besides, there is an advertising recession nationwide, and a particularly battered economy in Denver thanks to stumbles by the banking and real-estate industries. Those who run Denver and Miami's TV stations and regional sports channels are unlikely to spend as they would have in the profligate 80's. And remember that the new franchises will not share in the last year of baseball's $1.4 billion national TV contract when they begin play in 1993.
But there are three compelling reasons why more TV and cable money will be spent on the more densely populated Miami market (the 16th largest) than the Denver market (No. 19).
*There is heavy competition from at least two Miami independent TV stations, including, WSVN and WBFS (broadcaster of 25 Miami Heat games), compared with one extremely powerful independent, KWGN, in Denver.
*The presence of two arch-competitive Miami sports cable channels, SportsChannel Florida (owner of the rights to Heat games) and the Sunshine Network (which airs Orlando Magic games), but just one, Prime Network, in Denver.
*The Hispanic population, which is half of Miami's Dade County population, is served by the highly rated WLTV, owned by the Univision network, and WSCV, a smaller station owned by the other major Hispanic network, Telemundo.
Negotiations between the Miami franchise and sports-only channels will create tensions. Sunshine is larger than SportsChannel Florida (3 million subscribers to 1.1 million), but both are aggressive parts of huge cable outfits. Sunshine is part of the Prime Sports Network; SportsChannel Florida is owned by Cablevision Systems and NBC. Although both corporate parents have engaged in merger talks, the absence of an agreement allows both to bid.
"You have to look at the best interests of the team," said Ed Frazier, president of Prime Sports. "You want to build fan loyalty quicker, and since Miami will be the only team in Florida, it will want maximum distribution."
For Miami, the media rights could add up to $10 million.
 Denver is a different tale, where media rights may only earn the franchise $5 million. What distinguishes the mountainous Mile High City from flat, humid Miami is a location -- hundreds of miles from any other major league city -- that would give it de facto domination over virgin territory. The ownership envisions a TV sphere far beyond Denver, a network of TV affiliates expanding into Wyoming, Montana, Nebraska and New Mexico.
That's fine, but most of outer-Denver is sparsely populated, and rights fees from TV stations in distant cities won't be stunning. Said Mark Wyche, a vice president of Bortz & Co., a media consulting firm: "The largest portion of their revenues will come from the Denver area. I wouldn't be concerned with running a network through Wyoming and Montana."
Potential bidders for Denver baseball on TV and cable aren't frothing over the prospect of acquiring the rights to a sure loser of a team.
"This city has gone berserk over getting the team, but then there's reality," said John Suder, general manager of KWGN. "We've lived through six years of a recession. A deal is viable. But if they come in and try to get a lot of their $95 million expansion fee back in TV rights, it won't be easy."
 
Yanks' Ratings Drop Slightly
 Whatever new spirit may be infusing the youthful New York Yankees hasn't caught on with local TV viewers. Through 23 games on WPIX-TV, the average Nielsen rating is down a tad from last season, from 4.7 to 4.6. One rating point in the New York market represents 70,437 households. The season's shining moment was the June 11 rating of 7.6 for a road game against the Minnesota Twins, which beat a 6.2 for a Mets-Braves game. Through 28 broadcasts on WWOR-TV, the Mets average rating is up to 7.4 from last year's 6.3 at the same time, but that average has eroded steadily since May 7 when it hit 8.4.

HEADLINE: Disarming the Soviets, With Aid

 BODY:
There's a big reason for the West to think hard about giving economic assistance to the Soviet Union: Moscow's military spending. Even as the Soviets seek billions in aid, they maintain the largest army in the world, devote an extravagant share of their shrinking gross national product to defense and continue to modernize nuclear forces. That's why Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and others would condition aid on deep cuts.
But that might well do more harm than good. Most likely, it would undercut pressures inside the Soviet Union that are already forcing military cutbacks and would strengthen the hand of hard-liners who oppose East-West cooperation. 
 Moscow's defense budget is of less concern than its military power. Spending is actually slowing. But the Soviet Union has considerable military potential and a nuclear arsenal that could demolish the U.S. The task is to assure that these capabilities pose no threat. That requires the ultimate conversion -- turning the Soviet Union into a satisfied power, perhaps like France, whose nuclear arms seem utterly unthreatening.
Aid, and the economic engagement that accompanies it, could do just that. They would demonstrate good will when the Soviet people need it most. And they could spur Moscow to spend more on the better things in life and less on arms.
Even now, internal pressures are sapping Soviet military strength. Moscow still has all its tanks, but the treaty on conventional forces in Europe obliges it to spend money dismantling at least 7,500 of them. Draft calls go unanswered, not only in a few independence-minded republics but elsewhere. Last fall, 22 percent of those called up did not report for duty. A divided officer corps and troops who can't be counted on to obey orders leave the Red Army in no shape to menace its neighbors in the foreseeable future.
True, Moscow's nuclear modernization continues. But it's building fewer bombers and missiles than U.S. intelligence anticipated, and the pending strategic arms treaty will oblige it to cut what it has by a third. The reason Moscow is adding to its small strategic bomber force is that the treaty, at U.S. insistence, makes it advantageous to do so by discounting warheads on bombers.
The Soviets' new SS-25 missile could actually make the nuclear balance less precarious. With its single nuclear warhead, it poses less of a threat than multi-warhead missiles. And because its mobility makes it capable of surviving, Moscow need not launch it at the first signs of attack.
Tying economic aid to deeper cuts could easily slow the process. Moscow's military-industrial complex will see such demands as blackmail, and stiffen its resistance to economic reform. It would accuse Mikhail Gorbachev of selling out to the West and weakening the Soviet Union.
Better to leave the condition implicit and let the economic transformation of the Soviet Union force a reduction in defense spending, as it inevitably must. This is surely a calculated risk; yet Americans can count on those Soviets who appreciate two political facts of life. One is that a reforming Soviet Union can't afford to allocate as much to defense. The second is that a Soviet Union that fails to reform -- and fails also to make measurable cuts in military spending -- cannot indefinitely count on Western assistance.

HEADLINE: Newark Priest Wins a 'Genius' Award

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN TELTSCH

 BODY:
Msgr. William J. Linder is a parish priest with a mission to find creative ways of securing affordable housing, health care and better schools for people in one of Newark's poorest neighborhoods. His income: $10,000 a year.
Monsignor Linder was named yesterday as one of 31 winners of fellowships from Chicago's MacArthur Foundation. For this, he will receive $330,000 over the next five years. 
 "My first reaction was 'MacArthur what?' " said the 55-year-old pastor of St. Rose of Lima Church. Later, when he was told that the fellowships were given to gifted people and were sometimes called the "genius prizes," he cheerfully replied: "Now we're in trouble. I guess the cycle stops here."
Monsignor Linder, who earned a doctorate in sociology from Fordham University in 1988, said he intends to use his award money to visit poor neighborhoods in other cities in search of ideas to improve job opportunities for Newark's largely black and Hispanic residents.
 
A Model for Revitalization
 The New Community Corporation, which he founded in 1968, is regarded as a model for neighborhood revitalization. The corporation was established in Newark's Central Ward in an area that was virtually burned out in the riots of July 1967.
Among the corporation's accomplishments are 8 housing developments with 2,400 apartments, including a $4 million transitional housing project for homeless families. The project, called Harmony House, was created with government and private financing.
The corporation also established an alternative school, five day care centers, a shelter for battered women and part ownership in a Pathmark supermarket -- enterprises that helped create 1,150 jobs.
For now, finding more jobs for young people is a leading preoccupation, Monsignor Linder said, and that translates into attracting new business to the neighborhood. He said he was particularly pleased about the corporation's successful renovation of a deteriorating Gothic church that was turned into St. Joseph's Plaza, a complex that includes a medical clinic, a sandwich shop, a spa and a restaurant.
 
31 Winners This Year
 The MacArthur Fellowships were awarded this year to 9 women and 22 men, and the winners will receive from $150,000 to $375,000. Since the awards were established 10 years ago by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, more than $105 million has been invested in the program.
Winners must be recommended by a panel of 100 anonymous nominators and reviewed by a 12-member selection committee and the foundation's board members.

Greenhouse Gamblers

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
IF the experts don't really know how fast the atmosphere is warming or what the consequences of warming could be, what should Washington do to slow it down? To the Environmental Defense Fund, the answer seems obvious: Buy some insurance against catastrophe, and buy it as cheaply as possible.
The defense fund wants electric utilities to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases at least to the extent that their new plants are adding them. And it wants Uncle Sam to keep the cost down by creating a market for greenhouse gas "offsets," allowing a utility in, say, Virginia or Texas to meet its obligation by paying to plant trees in Costa Rica or to trap methane from garbage dumps in Ohio. 
 The plan is bound to receive a mixed reception in the White House. President Bush's economists championed a similar market-based plan for coping with acid rain, which is the centerpiece of last year's amendments to the Clean Air Act. But Administration skeptics, notably John Sununu, have yet to concede that anyone should be asked to spend money to solve an environmental problem that may never materialize.
Commercial power plants emitting 100,000 tons of carbon annually are by no means the only important sources of greenhouse gases. But they are prime targets for reformers because their emissions are relatively easy to monitor, and their pollution-control costs can be passed on to a broad base of customers.
The bill introduced yesterday by two Democratic Congressmen, Jim Cooper of Tennessee and Mike Synar of Oklahoma, would require utilities to save a ton of carbon (or its equivalent in other greenhouse gases) for every additional ton they pump into the air. Renovated plants would have to meet the same requirement after 1995. Plants might meet the standard by switching from coal to natural gas, which produces more watts per pound of carbon emitted, or by encouraging consumers to conserve energy. But the architects of the plan hope and expect utilities to go farther afield.
Dan Dudek, an Environmental Defense Fund economist, thinks offsets could be harvested at very low cost from dozens of sources. For example, huge amounts of methane, a far more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, are currently vented from coal mines. And most of the chlorofluorocarbon gases, the most destructive of all greenhouse chemicals, are now lost when refrigerators and air-conditioners are scrapped.
Utilities might not wish to collect waste gases from mines or abandoned appliances. But they certainly could pay others to do the collecting. And if there were an active market for offsets, they could simply buy as many tons as they needed, the way General Mills buys wheat on the commodity exchanges.
The oldest objection to markets for pollution offsets -- that sinners should not be permitted to buy indulgences -- no longer carries much weight among economically sophisticated environmentalists. But other qualms are not so easily dismissed.
One is cost. Almost everyone agrees that offsets represent the cheapest and least intrusive way to buy insurance against greenhouse warming. But there is wide disagreement over how cheap the insurance would be.
Drawing on a report published last month by the National Academy of Sciences, Mr. Dudek estimates that utilities could meet the bill's requirements through the year 2005 at a cost of $10 billion to $20 billion. Bush Administration economists fear the academy is too optimistic. They doubt, for example, that higher-mileage cars would pay for themselves in savings at the pump.
But the most fundamental objection is the most imponderable: How much should be spent on a greenhouse solution before it is certain there is a greenhouse problem? The White House is in no mood to purchase a $10 billion o $20 billion insurance policy on the strength of current science. It is holding out for a far more cautious "no regrets" policy, curbing greenhouse gases only to the extent that the limits can be justified on other grounds. The prime target: chlorofluorocarbons, which are also the chief culprits in thinning the atmosphere's protective layer of ozone.
President Bush surely has the muscle to block legislation this year. But with Europe pressing for a greenhouse fix, and big business afraid to be caught on the politically incorrect side of the debate, delay is becoming less tenable.
Sooner or later -- probably sooner -- Washington is likely to leap into the unknown. When it does, an offsets plan is going to look better to the free marketers in the White House than heavy taxes on carbon emissions or the direct regulation of polluters.

HEADLINE: Summer School Cuts Create Private Boom

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3d

 BODY:
These are boom times at the New York Military Academy.
Despite the recession and the $2,200 cost for six weeks of private summer school, the academy in Cornwall-on-Hudson expects to enroll 150 students this year, up from about 80 students in the past several years. 
 Much of the growth is a result of budget cutbacks that have forced public schools to reduce or eliminate summer school. One Long Island mother, for example, recently called the academy to enroll her son in two courses that he failed this year. He was unable to take the classes at his public school because budget cutbacks had led it to reduce its summer school offerings.
"She was frantic," recalled Peter Wicker, director of admissions for the academy, which is 62 miles north of New York City. "Public schools are helping us out tremendously."
 
A Nationwide Trend
 At private summer schools and education camps elsewhere -- from Rhode Island to Ohio to California -- enrollment is also booming, because of widespread cutbacks in public summer school programs.
The Milwaukee school system, facing a $33 million deficit in the 1991-92 school year, eliminated transportation to schools and cut back to four weeks from six weeks on academic enrichment and music classes. As a result, school officials say they expect 3,000 fewer students will be able to attend summer school this year from last year's enrollment of 25,000.
In another Wisconsin system, Stevens Point, officials eliminated summer school. Last year, 2,600 students, or about 40 percent of the 7,400 total enrollment, attended the system's free summer programs.
Rather than cutting summer programs, some school systems have started charging for them. In Chicago, enrichment and remedial courses now cost $75 a credit. Even so, "because of our smaller summer program, some are turning to other options like private schools in larger numbers this year," said Joseph Ruiz, an administrator in the office of school operations.
There are other facors behind the growth of private summer programs. Parents are increasingly concerned about the quality of public schools and want to supplement their children's public education with academic courses and learning skills in a small classroom setting that they feel the public schools cannot match.
 
Rise in Private Programs
 The parental worries, combined with the demise this year in many places of public summer school, have prompted 312 private schools and camps to offer education programs this summer, a 55 percent increase since 1986, when 201 private summer education programs were offered, according to Peterson's Guides, which publishes a national directory of private summer schools and camps for children and teen-agers.
"While it is true that public schools are cutting back summer schools, it's also true that parents' perception of the quality of education at public schools is down," said Bill Cole, a spokesman for Peterson's Guides. "Parents are turning to private schools."
Private schools and camps have seized on the interest through aggressive marketing. Small class sizes, remedial and enrichment courses, recreation, culture and weekend trips are all offered -- and cost as much as $5,000 for six weeks.
The private summer schools and camps have also made themselves increasingly attractive by reaching agreements with state education departments, which evaluate curriculums and certify private programs, allowing students to transfer their private school or camp credits to their public institution.
 
Impact on Minorities
 For many, the shift toward private summer schools and camps is distressing. The cutbacks in public summer school have eliminated or severely reduced options for the less affluent, who are often members of minority groups who live in the inner cities.
Others see the push toward private summer school alternatives as an extension of school choice, the hotly-debated approach favored by the Bush Administration to allow parents to choose their childrens' schools, either public or private. The theory is that underperforming public schools will improve because of the pressure of losing students, and therefore funding. But critics say poor and minority students would be left behind in the worst schools because affluent families would seize the opportunity under choice programs to put their children in private schools.
"What you are seeing in the summer school phenomenon is a reflection of the whole issue of school choice," said Henrietta Schwartz, dean of the school of education at San Francisco State University. She said private schools were positioning themselves to take advantage of vouchers that could become available if President Bush's proposed choice plan was enacted.
In the meantime, private summer schools and camps are prospering this year, and they owe much of their success to financially troubled public schools.
In Cincinnati, for instance, a dire fiscal climate forced the school district to cancel all summer classes this year, except those for pupils in kindergarten through third grade and for high school seniors who need credits to graduate this year. Last year, the school system's summer program, which offers both remedial and enrichment courses, served 5,200 students, or about 5 percent of the school system's total enrollment, many of them poor, inner-city youths. This summer, the system expects to enroll about half that many students.
 
Painful Cuts in Cincinnati
 "We admitted from the very beginning that these cuts were very painful," said John Burner, a spokesman for the Cincinnati school system.
But as Cincinnati canceled the bulk of its summer school offerings, Purcell Marian School found itself reaping the benefits. The private Roman Catholic school offers only a remedial program, at $95 a course, but despite its limited offerings and the expense, attendance at the there is expected to swell to 500 students this summer, from 380 last year.
"We've had so many walk-ins," said Jan Rich, principal of the summer program at the Catholic school. "I suspect we'll have to close our registration period early because we will be full."
Some parents whose public school systems have retained some semblance of summer school despite budget cuts have turned to private summer schooling anyway.
Take Boye Barrie, who recently completed fourth grade in the Deer Park, L.I., school system. Stanley Diamond, who is the child's guardian, wanted his 11-year-old charge to attend summer school but ruled out the local public school program because of its limited course offerings and the lack of organized activities.
Mr. Diamond selected the New York Military Academy, where Boye will take English and other courses while also participating in horseback riding and rafting.
"I wanted him to get a combination of academics and activities," Mr. Diamond said. "It's a much better environment."
Other parents, while supporting public schools, concede that private alternatives offer more advanced and specialized training than public schools can provide. In Fort Collins, Colo., David Neenan, disturbed by the quality of public education, two years ago sent three of his four daugters to a private summer education camp, where they polished their writing skills, and learned to think critically and how to study better.
"I wanted to make sure that all those competencies were taught," said Mr. Neenan, who has spent 12 years on the local school board. "The tide in public education has gone out and I don't know that it's coming back."

Dollar Stages an Advance On Greenspan's Comments

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar advanced yesterday after Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said the economy is likely to bottom out during the current quarter.
Gold prices closed higher, edging up in New York after posting larger gains overseas. 
 Gold was up 10 cents, to $368.30 an ounce, on the Commodity Exchange in New York. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $367.75, up 15 cents.
Mr. Greenspan told the House Ways and Means Committee that economic figures "over the last several weeks strongly suggested that the bottom is somewhere in the second quarter," which ends June 30.
The Fed chairman added that there were no signs yet that the economy had begun to grow again.
Analysts said that traders who favor the dollar were heartened by Mr. Greenspan's statements because an end to the economic downturn might lead to higher interest rates. Higher rates tend to support the dollar by increasing foreign demand for American investments.
Robert Ryan, corporate foreign exchange manager with the Bank of New York, said the dollar was also aided by expectations of a narrow merchandise trade deficit for April. The Commerce Department is to announce its trade figures today.
"The market figures it's going to be a deficit of $4 billion to $4.5 billion," Mr. Ryan said.
He said the dollar appeared to be on an upward trend. He noted that there had been no intervention by central banks to bring the dollar down.
"It's stacking up for the dollar to go higher and higher," he said.
The British pound, which has been weak recently, continued its slide against the dollar. Sterling fell to $1.6100 in New York from late Monday's $1.6265. In earlier London trading, the pound fell to $1.6120, from $1.6258 late Monday.
The dollar rose to 141.08 Japanese yen in New York from 140.70. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar closed at 141.06 yen, up 0.13 yen, and in London, it was quoted at 140.85 yen.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday, included: 1.81635 German marks, up from 1.7955; 1.5645 Swiss francs, up from 1.5435; 6.1725 French francs, up from 6.0975; 1,351.00 Italian lire, up from 1,337.00, and 1.14225 Canadian dollars, up from 1.14175.
In London, gold rose to a late bid of $370, from $367.75 late Monday. In Zurich, it rose to a closing bid of $370.25 from $366.75. The Hong Kong market was closed yesterday.
Silver picked up 1.2 cents to close at $4.448 an ounce on the Commodity Exchange in New York.

HEADLINE: Little Change For C.D.'s, Bank Funds

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields on certificates of deposit and money market accounts were down slightly to unchanged for the week ended yesterday.
According to The Bank Rate Monitor, an interest rate publication based in North Palm Beach, Fla., the latest rate trend shows the downturn in bank yields easing as the ratio between banks that are raising yields and those that are lowering yields begins to narrow. 
 At the Treasury Department's weekly auction held on Monday, average discount rates moved up for the third consecutive week to their highest since late April.
 
Rise of a Basis Point
 The rise in rates at the auctions over the last few weeks offers some hope to depositors, since the bill auctions often indicate what many banks may eventually pay on money market accounts and certificates of deposit. The three-month bill rose a basis point, to 5.61 percent, with the six-month bill increasing by a similar amount, to 5.79 percent. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.
Acknowledging that savings rates are down to four-year lows, Robert K. Heady, publisher of The Bank Rate Monitor, noted that banks were scrambling to keep depositors in this low-yield environment by adding new wrinkles to existing products or promoting products that appear to earn higher yields.
The largest yield changes in New York area banks this week were reported at Astoria Federal Savings, which added 11 basis points to its money market account, to yield 5.75 percent, and the Bank of New York, which reduced its money market account by 11 basis points, to 5.44 percent. Connecticut Bank and Trust posted the largest change for a three-month certificiate of deposit, by lowering the yield 21 basis points, to 5.74 percent. For a six-month certificate, Howard Savings Bank, based in Newark, and Connecticut Bank and Trust both lowered the yield by 10 basis points, to 6.30 percent and 5.85 percent, respectively; Anchor Savings Bank, based in Hewlett, L.I., raised the yield 10 basis points, to 5.9 percent.
Among commercial banks, the average money market account remained unchanged at 5.15 percent. A three-month certificate fell 2 basis points, to 5.5 percent, while a six-month maturity held at 5.67 percent.
Depositors at savings institutions saw the average yield on a money market account remain unchanged at 5.57 percent. A three-month certificate fell 3 basis points, to 5.8 percent, while a six-month maturity remained unchanged at 6.02 percent.
By comparison, at 20 large banks outside the New York market, the average money market yield fell by a basis point, to 5.25 percent, with no change in the average yield of a six-month certificate, at 5.74 percent.

HEADLINE: Treasury Criticizes Plan to Limit Bank Insurance

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 18

 BODY:
The Administration today sharply criticized a last-minute proposal that would limit Federal deposit insurance to banks that are restricted to traditional banking activities and deny it for riskier ventures.
The proposal, drafted by Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat, is being considered just as the House Banking Committee is scheduled to begin its final consideration of the Treasury Department's proposed changes in banking laws, the most sweeping overhaul of the banking system since the 1930's. 
 The Schumer proposal is intended to reduce losses on deposit insurance by placing risky banking activities outside the protection of the insurance fund.
Only a "core" bank would be eligible for deposit insurance and the bank would be restricted to the types of loans that are least likely to go into default -- for instance, consumer and small-business loans. Riskier activities, like commercial lending, would be permitted only in separately capitalized subsidiaries not protected by deposit insurance.
Jerome H. Powell, an Assistant Treasury Secretary, said before the banking committee that the measure could "create or aggravate future credit crunches and otherwise disrupt routine commercial lending activites."
Mr. Powell said the proposal represented a fundamental change that would "launch our financial system into uncharted waters." He said the measure could reduce the international competitiveness of banks and produce regional credit shortages. There are sufficient safeguards in the Treasury banking measure under consideration to limit taxpayer exposure to losses from bank failures, he said.
Mr. Powell estimated that $1.5 trillion would be driven from the banking system under the Schumer proposal, reducing the availability of credit to an array of borrowers. He also strongly objected to proposed caps on the interest rates that "core" banks would pay depositors. And he said restrictions in the Schumer proposal that would sharply curtail the amount of loans a bank could make to one borrower were far too severe.
"This is a large-scale experiment and there may be something in it," Mr. Powell said. "But we have no confidence."
The Schumer proposal, which will be introduced as an amendment to the proposal on banking change now working its way through Congress, is seen as a possible compromise for a House Banking Committee that wants to reduce restrictive banking regulations, a House Commerce Committee concerned about reducing historic divisions between banking and commerce and the Treasury Department's package of proposals to modernize banking.
L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, said that while the Schumer proposal was a sensible approach, he objected to controls on interest rates that would restrict the core banks to offering depositors no more than 105 percent of the rate paid on Treasury securities. "The history of price controls is the history of failure," Mr. Seidman said.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Networks Having Trouble Peddling Fall's Prime Time

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
USUALLY at this time of the year, the broadcast television networks are merrily ringing up hefty price increases on the commercials they sell for the coming fall season's prime-time programs. But now the bells sound as if they are tolling, not ringing.
As the annual advance sales process -- known to the advertising, marketing and media communities as the up-front market -- continues, earlier expectations that prices would fall are proving true. The reason that ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC are cutting prices in the up-front market is the slack demand for commercial time from marketers that are reducing or postponing ad spending in response to the recession. 
 And since advertisers are instructing their agencies to trim up-front purchases of time for the 1991-92 season, the networks find themselves in the unusual position of needing to cut rates to make sales.
The combination of reduced prices and decreased demand is making it more difficult than usual to estimate how much business the networks will book by the time the up-front market ends next month. Agency media executives who have been participating in up-front negotiations -- a ritual that many describe as a bazaar crossed with a chess match and a bullfight -- are placing their estimates within a range of $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion, compared with $4.3 billion in last year's up-front market for the 1990-91 season. If the market does conclude at the lower end of that range, it would be about equal to the up-front market for the 1989-90 season.
The up-front participants are also estimating that the networks are cutting prices by 8 percent to 12 percent from what they charged during the 1990-91 up-front market.
"It is a soft economy, so it is a soft network marketplace," said Jon Mandel, senior vice president and director of national broadcast at Grey Advertising in New York. "How long that continues is, frankly, anybody's guess, but right now there are deals to be had."
The price reductions and soft demand have put an end to the networks' annual attempts to create a "jump on the bandwagon" mentality among advertisers during the up-front market, said Gene DeWitt, president of DeWitt Media Inc., a New York media management company that buys commercials for clients including Reebok International and American Family Publishers. "No one's buying that act this year," Mr. DeWitt said.
It used to be "that he who buys early buys best," said Jerome Dominus, senior vice president and director of national television and programming for J. Walter Thompson U.S.A. in New York. "Now, there's a fire sale," said Mr. Dominus, who formerly was on the other side of the table during the up-front market as the head of network sales at CBS.
As often occurs in the up-front market, the networks are pursuing varying strategies, according to participants. They describe CBS and NBC as "trying to sell everything they can up front," as Mr. DeWitt put it, because they are less bullish on prospects for the recession to end anytime soon and would rather book the revenue now than later.

HEADLINE: About New York

BYLINE: By Douglas Martin

 BODY:
A late summer afternoon is oozing into a sultry evening, and people on 45th Avenue between 21st and 23rd Streets in Long Island City are performing their nightly ballet. Some scurry home from work, some bounce balls, some chat with neighbors, some walk dogs. All are living city lives in the truest sense.
It was Jane Jacobs, the writer who changed the way many Americans think about their cities, who most persuasively preached the importance of sidewalks. In her 1961 book, "The Death and Life of Great American Cities," she called them "active participants in the drama of civilization versus barbarism in cities." 
That isn't a novel thought to Margaret Freeborn, who has been sitting nightly on the same stoop on this lushly shaded Queens street for 46 years, always with her current dog. The current one is a poodle named Whitey. "My best pal," Mrs. Freeborn calls him.
She has long owned her home and two rooming houses on 45th Avenue and has made many pals on the street, as well as acquaintances she would never dream of allowing in her knickknack-cluttered row house. She chain-smokes unfiltered Chesterfields, jokes sardonically, guards her age like a gem and goes the extra mile for fellow humans. She has paid burial expenses for some tenants.
Since her husband, John, died in November, she is alone more. But she is seldom lonely: there is that parade forever passing her stoop.
Danny, a Cuban man carrying a quart of beer and a bag of platanos, stops to complain about the price of cigars. An unemployed man with a pregnant wife sinks to his knees to ask for money, and gets a $10 "loan" as well as a warning not to spend it on gin. A dancer in "Miss Saigon" stops to talk about the Broadway show. A man with AIDS sits silently for few minutes. A red-haired woman in a very short skirt drops a breezy hello. Everyone greets Whitey by name.
A few years of this, one gets to know things about people. The man with a cane shuffling into a house across the street abandoned a wife and five children, leaving them on welfare. That woman is a drug addict; this man won a bowling tournament back when there was a neighborhood alley; that taciturn man survived the Holocaust.
And one gets to know people, some fundamentally. Eddie, who is retarded, was disconsolate when his mother died. Then Mrs. Freeborn told him that his mother was in heaven, and for a long time he kept looking up with a big smile.
Sitting on a sidewalk gives one a sense of time's passage. When first settled in the early 17th century, this whole area of Long Island City -- Hunters Point -- was a ledge of rocks in the East River. Then came the Long Island Rail Road, and residents became accustomed to seeing Theodore Roosevelt change trains on his way to Sagamore Hill. The coming of the Queensboro Bridge in 1909 and elevated trains soon thereafter made the area a handy enclave for Broadway types.
This show-business past still sparkles in Mrs. Freeborn's memory. Next door lived Lottie Burnell, an old-time movie actress. It was at her house that Mrs. Freeborn met Tallulah Bankhead and Pat O'Brien. Rin-Tin-Tin's almost forgotten son, Rinty, was buried in her backyard.
So much has changed. Gone are two drugstores, a barber shop with an old-fashioned revolving pole, St. John's Hospital and what Mrs. Freeborn calls "little neighborhood bars for the little neighborhood guys." What has thrust up in their place is the glass tower of the new Citicorp building, which looms over the northern end of the street like a misplaced rocket ship.
In her magical backyard -- where she raises roses and has assembled scores of flamingos, squirrels and other lawn ornaments, and is now nursing an injured pigeon -- Mrs. Freeborn keeps the crucifix that once crowned St. John's Hospital.
"I found it in a garbage can," she said. "Wasn't that a disgrace?"
She remembers being a platinum blonde, meeting Jackie Gleason at the old Club 18, enjoying trips to Atlantic City before gambling ruined the place and bringing up two sons, Frankie and Willie. Both are now grandfathers.
Not an hour goes by without her hearing her husband's last words: "Happy birthday, Marge."
This wise woman of the clear blue eyes remembers all her hundreds of tenants. There was one known as Wolf Man, whom she felt sorry for and gave a free room. There was the Japanese man who took such haunting photos. There was Jimmy, who was deaf and could not speak. "I had him talking," she said.
In the late sun on a New York City stoop, thoughts can jumble a bit. But one seems inescapable. When there were more rooming houses like Mrs. Freeborn's -- and more people sat on stoops -- the world was a better place.

HEADLINE: Camden Fights Sewer Tax as Bill From Unwanted Guest

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAMDEN, N.J., June 14

 BODY:
On a warm day the stench from a sewage-treatment plant hangs like a foul blanket over the modest row houses and abandoned factories here by the Delaware River.
Driven by both the smell and their own sense of powerlessness, nearly one of every three property owners in Camden is refusing to pay an annual $275 sewer assessment, prompting threats of liens and foreclosures. 
 The State Assembly has approved a bill that allows Camden to negotiate for more favored treatment on fees with the sewer authority that serves the county. The legislation raises anew the question of whether the state's affluent areas use poorer cities as a dumping ground for projects they need but do not want nearby: landfills, prisons, incinerators.
 
Fee Adjustment Demanded
 Leaders of the revolt against the sewer assessment are demanding that it be eliminated or reduced citywide, not just because of complaints about the plant's odor, but also because the city collects no property taxes from the 44 acres of waterfront property where the plant stands.
Few residents in South Camden have air-conditioning, and they say the treatment plant is a particularly noxious neighbor in the summer.
"Some days some of the children get sick and throw up, and I have to call their parents to come and get them," said Viola Vukich, who for 22 years has been the secretary at the Sacred Heart School, a few hundred yards from the treatment plant.
Some 7,500 property owners have refused to pay the sewer assessment, which comes to $68.50 every quarter. As a result, the Camden County Municipal Utilities Authority has threatened to foreclose on delinquent property owners.
 
'We Were All Getting Sick'
 "I haven't paid any of the assessments," said 71-year-old Carmella Labato, who has lived her entire life across the street from the Sacred Heart Roman Catholic Church and School, one of the centers of protest over the treatment plant and other community issues. "They keep sending me bills, and I don't pay them. I want to stay here, but it's hard to even pay my taxes."
"Two, three years ago the odor got so intense we were all getting sick. They say we have to pay for the smell. I won't."
Camden has been home to the sewage-treatment plant for decades. Two years ago the plant expanded and began treating not just Camden's sewage, but that of every other community in the county, 37 in all: more than 50 millions gallons of sewage a day.
On June 10 the State Assembly approved a bill that would allow Camden to negotiate an adjustment in rates with the independent sewer authority that runs the plant, the Camden County Municipal Utilities Authority. Later this month the measure is expected to go before the State Senate, where it faces a fight from suburban opponents who fear their own assessments could go up if Camden's are cut.
August Longo, the Mayor of Haddon Heights and a strong voice in the Camden County Mayor's Association, which is dominated by suburban communities, said most suburban mayors asked, "Why should we pay for all of Camden?"
Three years ago the mayor's association sued and blocked a $2 million payment to Camden by the Camden County Board of Chosen Freeholders to reduce or eliminate the sewage fees that city residents paid. The payment was to be an interim measure until a permanent adjustment in fees could be worked out. The state was to put up another $2 million, but the action of the mayor's association also made that moot.
To the Rev. Michael Doyle, pastor of Sacred Heart, it is a clash between haves and have-nots.
"Camden is the weak chicken in the coop, economically and politically, and everything that is undesirable ends up being dumped on it," he said, standing in the parking lot of the church, which sits between the sewage-treatment plant and the 340-foot tower of another county plant, a giant trash incinerator.
"We'd love to be merely between a rock and a hard place. That would be something of a blessing."
Father Doyle is part of a citywide coalition of 23 churches called Camden Churches Organized for People, which is leading the sewer protest. The church itself is exempt from the sewer assessment, but the school, largely attended by black and Hispanic children from the neighborhood, is assessed $275 for every 30 children in its enrollment of 230. It owes the sewer authority more than $10,000. Father Doyle refuses to pay.
Others, fearful of losing their homes, have yielded.
"We didn't pay it for a year, but we got nervous and started paying it," said Eleanor Bogdan, who has lived in the South Camden neighborhood for 30 years with her husband, a retired welder. "I wish I could bottle the air and take it to the legislators so they would know what we live with."

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Wang Joins I.B.M. in a Marketing Alliance

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
Wang Laboratories, the struggling computer maker, appeared to move toward ending its role as a hardware manufacturer yesterday when it sought shelter in an unusual marketing alliance with its archrival, I.B.M.
As part of a deal in which Wang will sell I.B.M. personal computers, work stations and minicomputers, the International Business Machines Corporation agreed to invest up to $100 million in Wang. The Lowell, Mass., company has been among I.B.M.'s biggest rivals for the largest corporate accounts. 
 The arrangement will almost certainly lead Wang, which now makes minicomputers and personal computers, to withdraw as a computer maker and try to survive as a software developer and I.B.M. computer reseller, several analysts said.
But Richard W. Miller, Wang's chairman, said the company planned to continue to support its existing proprietary line of VS minicomputers and that it had not yet decided whether to stop making its own personal computers.
"This is good news for Wang customers and Wang Laboratories," Mr. Miller said, adding that the new relationship with I.B.M. would free the company to concentrate on its strongest areas. "There are certain segments of the industry that Wang can not afford to spend money on in the future," he said.
Industry analysts said the alliance would probably lead to deep cutbacks at Wang.
"Wang will have little use for any manufacturing in the future," said Casey Stern, an analyst at Starr Securities. He said the company could save as much as $300 million to $400 million a year. That could translate into staff cuts of as many as 6,000 to 8,000 employees or up to half the work force.
Other analysts said that the strategy was tremendously risky.
"I worry that there will be a significant gap between the fall-off of Wang's minicomputer sales and the increase in their software business," said George Colony, an analyst at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. "I think they've traded off short-term revenue for a nice long-term strategy."
The alliance of Wang and I.B.M. is further evidence of a long-term consolidation that has been transforming the computer business for a decade. Many computer companies that had traditionally based their business on proprietary software and hardware product lines have been failing with the advent of powerful desktop computers and the shift toward open systems.
Mr. Stern of Starr Securities said Wang had been forced into a partnership with I.B.M. because it was unable to manage the transition from its traditional minicomputer base to a new business based on networks of personal computers and work stations. He said revenues had been shrinking by about 15 to 20 percent quarterly.
I.B.M. will provide initial financing of $25 million to Wang in the form of debt convertible into Wang class B common shares, representing about 3 to 4 percent of the company's class B shares outstanding. I.B.M. officials said they would also provide up to an additional $75 million in the next two and a half years.
Wang will market both I.B.M.'s RS/ 6000 work station line and its PS/2 personal computers under the Wang label. Wang will sell I.B.M.'s AS/400 minicomputer under the I.B.M. label.
 
'No Hidden Agenda'
 A number of analysts suggested that the alliance was a first step toward I.B.M.'s acquisition of Wang -- a possibility officials at both companies strongly denied.
"I.B.M.'s commitment is long-term, but this is not a merger, takeover or buyout," said Terry Lautenbach, an I.B.M. senior vice president. "There is no hidden agenda here."
But Mr. Stern said Wang had technologies -- like electronic imaging systems -- and market strength that I.B.M. might find beneficial. He said he would not rule out a deeper financial relationship.
"I.B.M. needed to figure out a way to buy Wang without getting bad press," Mr. Stern said.
Several of Wang's big customers were pleased with the alliance. "Wang has a large and loyal customer base," said a corporate manager at a large chemical company. "Wang salesmen have been fighting I.B.M. in their accounts. The integration of their products might be good for us."
In its efforts to increase its revenue in the face of industry consolidation, I.B.M., based in Armonk, N.Y., has tried to increase the number of arrangements allowing other companies to resell its computer systems and parts like disk drives.

HEADLINE: Again, Grim Shelters House a Rising Number of Families

BYLINE: By THOMAS MORGAN

 BODY:
New York City's emergency shelter system for families is growing more crowded again, and advocates say conditions are harsher than ever.
Despite hopeful signs early last summer that the Dinkins administration might do what the Koch administration had never accomplished -- move all families out of welfare hotels and other emergency shelters and into permanent housing -- the trend now is in the other direction. 
 Last week, after months of steady increase, there were 4,566 families in the city's temporary shelter system, compared with 3,364 a year ago. At its peak in 1987 the system -- which is separate from the shelters intended for single adults -- was home to 5,200 families. The families are given emergency housing in welfare hotels, large barracks-style shelters and smaller shelters with private rooms.
Many of those entering the system these days must wait until the early morning hours for a ride to a shelter, only to have to return to a welfare office a few hours later to start the process over for the next night.
 
Barracks-Style Shelters
 The long waits are only part of the ordeal. Because the city is short of suitable accommodations, pregnant women and mothers with babies -- who are supposed to get private rooms -- are frequently being sent to large shelters where there have been outbreaks of contagious diseases, including measles. In the large barracks-style shelters, many spend days without sheets, towels, pillows or cribs.
On a recent night, a city office in Brooklyn where homeless families come to be placed in shelters was crowded with more than a dozen families, among them Kristy Morales and her 4-month-old daughter, Stephanie, who had come in at 5 P.M.
By midnight, Mrs. Morales was near tears, rocking her daughter, whispering over and over: "I'm sorry, I'm so sorry." She was not taken to a shelter to put her baby to sleep until 4 A.M.A small part of the increase in families seeking shelter, experts say, is due to the city's troubled economy which has left more families homeless.
But the bulk of the backup in the system is due to a decrease in the number of apartments the city is making available to homeless families -- the result of an early Dinkins administration initiative that seems to have backfired.
When Mayor David N. Dinkins took office, he stepped up efforts begun by the Koch administration to decrease the number of families in shelters by giving them permanent housing. The effort was spurred by the threat of a cutoff in Federal funds for long-term stays in decrepit welfare hotels.
The new effort meant some homeless families got their own apartments in three months. That success, officials say, prompted many families who had been living in overcrowded conditions -- often doubled-up with relatives or friends -- to flood into the system in hopes of getting apartments.
The Dinkins administration responded by taking 1,000 apartments originally intended for the homeless and setting them aside for families that were not homeless yet, but were living doubled-up with others.
 
Battle in the Courts
 The loss of those apartments has in turn caused a bottleneck in the emergency shelter system, officials admit. Advocates say it has also overwhelmed the city's administrative abilities.
Last month, lawyers for the Legal Aid Society filed a contempt motion in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, accusing Mayor Dinkins, Barbara J. Sabol, the city's Human Resources Administrator, and other welfare officials of failing to meet court orders mandating minimum housing standards for homeless families.
"One of the most disgraceful things about what is happening nightly," said Steven Banks, who heads the society's Homeless Family Rights Project, "is that the city seems to have given up all pretense of complying with basic court orders, let alone meeting the basic needs of families suffering greatly because of the city's indifference."
In court papers, the Homeless Family Rights Project said that from September 1990 to May of this year, at least 691 families with pregnant women or newborn infants were placed in barracks shelters in violation of the city's own policy. A hearing on the group's motion is scheduled for July 23.
City officials say they will argue that they have done their best and would like to do more. But they say the city's fiscal crisis and limited funds to develop housing and other programs restrict what can be done.
 
Noise and Frustration
 In the crowded placement office in Brooklyn where Mrs. Morales and Stephanie waited last week, an occasional name was called over the loudspeaker, breaking the din of wailing babies and arguments between frustrated mothers and welfare officials.
A guard sitting at one end of the waiting room shouted at children and adults milling about to move aside so he could see the television better. From his desk, the guard shouted other instructions to mothers across the room.
A caseworker who reeked of alcohol by 10 P.M. forgot whose name he had called on his list and made endless trips to ask mothers about details he had already gathered. One mother, frustrated that her children were playing on the floor amid debris from a dinner snack, grabbed a broom to sweep the floor while a janitor, whose job it was to clean the waiting room, watched her from across the room.
The two cribs for babies in a corner of the waiting room were constantly occupied, sometimes with two babies in each. Several mothers said they refused to use the cribs because others used them as changing tables. By midnight, the sheets were soiled. One mother used a piece of plastic to cover her baby sleeping in one crib.
 
'It's Tough Times'
 City welfare officials have said repeatedly that they are doing their best to cope with a bad situation. Larry Schatt, director of the city's Family Emergency Assistance Program, said that welfare hotels have been improved and that more than 1,000 temporary apartments and private rooms have been provided to homeless families since November.
He also said workers try to place families in emergency shelters as quickly as possible. "We have real good people in our system who are seeing people at their worst, working at night when everyone is tired and irritable," Mr. Schatt said. "The rewards are not huge. It's tough times."
He said yesterday that the city had adopted new procedures this week to shorten the time families spend waiting at night to get emergency shelter.
 
'Like I'm a Bad Mother'
 At the Brooklyn Emergency Assistance Unit last week, Mrs. Morales kept rocking baby Stephanie, with her Windex-blue eyes, whispering to her over and over, smoking cigarettes and watching the ordeals around her.
"Sometimes the caseworkers make me feel so bad, like I'm a bad mother, when I've never done drugs and I'm just having hard times right now," Mrs. Morales said.
She said she came to New York City from Syracuse last year to help take care of her husband's ill sister. When she arrived, she discovered she was pregnant and she stayed, renting rooms wherever she could. After giving birth to Stephanie, she began receiving welfare. Recently, after conjugal visits with her husband, who is in prison upstate for auto theft, she discovered she was pregnant again.
When her turn came up, one of the caseworkers asked Mrs. Morales through the window to sign a waiver so she could be placed in a barracks-style shelter without a crib for the baby -- which she did, apparently without understanding her rights or the city's legal obligations. The caseworker did not tell her that it was against court orders for the city to present such waivers, or that he had violated city policy on the matter. He also tried to talk her out of applying for shelter at all, and asked whether she had another place to sleep, Mrs. Morales said.
 
No Blankets
 "I'm from Syracuse -- I've never been through anything like this," she said later, when a Legal Aid monitor at the shelter told her she had a right to a crib and a private room because she was pregnant and had an infant.
By midnight Mrs. Morales learned she would be sent to the Bushwick Shelter at 1675 Broadway in Brooklyn for an overnight placement in a private room. Nearly two dozen families who had been told where they would be sent were still in the office; none of them left on the city's vans and buses before 2 A.M. Mrs. Morales arrived at the shelter at 4 A.M., and was placed in a room -- a former office -- without blankets, pillows, towels or diapers. She got a bed, a crib and four sheets.
Mrs. Morales got up at 7:30 to return to the office to talk to a caseworker about shelter for the next night. Instead, she was brought to the hospital, where she suffered a miscarriage later that day. A friend is taking care of Stephanie.

The nation's senior banking regulator will call for $80 billion to keep the costly savings and loan bailout going into next year and will also seek an overhaul of the way the rescue is managed.
The proposals are to be delivered to a Congressional committee on Thursday by L. William Seidman, chairman of both the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which insures bank deposits, and the Resolution Trust Corporation, which is overseeing the savings and loan bailout. Mr. Seidman is facing mounting criticism, both for the costs of the savings rescue and for the increasing problems at the banks. 
 A draft of Mr. Seidman's testimony, which he sent today to the Treasury Department and described to officials and lawmakers on Capitol Hill, was obtained from a person outside the deposit insurance corporation.
 
Seeking the Offensive
 Mr. Seidman's testimony is a clear attempt to take the political offensive by suggesting change. The Administration took the unusual step last year of trying publicly to force Mr. Seidman, an independent regulator, from office. Since then, it has turned to him as it has tried to dissociate itself from blame in the growing savings and loan and bank crises.
Mr. Seidman's proposal could reopen the rift. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, who is expected to ask Congress for at least $50 billion for the bailout next week, favors the present structure.
The core of Mr. Seidman's proposal is to limit sharply the deposit corporation's control over the Resolution Trust Corporation by creating a separate board for it, giving the deposit corporation only a third of the votes.
When Congress and the White House set up the trust corporation two years ago, day-to-day control was given to the deposit corporation board because of its experience in handling failed banks.
 
Delays and Second-Guessing
 But many critics and executives who have dealt with the trust corporation say bureaucratic delays and second-guessing by the deposit corporation have been at the root of Resolution Trust's problems.
Last week, the General Accounting Office said that while the trust corporation had made significant progress in setting up a system to dispose of the billions of dollars in land, securities and other assets that the Government has seized from collapsed savings and loan associations, the agency was in such disarray that auditors were unable to provide a measure of the ultimate costs of the bailout.
As a supervisor of failed banks, the deposit corporation is also facing its worst year since its creation during the Depression, with as many as 440 banks expected to fail in the next 18 months, up from an earlier estimate of 340.
Mr. Seidman, in giving the latest estimate last week, heightened fears that the fund that protects depositors might soon be forced to rely upon taxpayer assistance. On Wednesday, the House Banking Committee is scheduled to begin considering an Administration proposal that the deposit corporation borrow $70 billion. The Bush Administration insists the banks would repay the amount, $25 billion of which would come from the Treasury, over the next 10 years.
Criticism of the savings bailout is also strong outside of Washington. Last Thursday the top state bank regulator from Arizona added his voice to the chorus of complaints about the trust corporation.
The assessment by William H. Rivoir 3d, Arizona's superintendent of banks, is significant because his state ranks second only to Texas in the amount of real estate in Government hands from failed savings associations. Arizona now accounts for about $1.7 billion, or 9.6 percent of the total real estate held by the trust corporation.
"The situation is so bad that I do not exaggerate when I say that the R.T.C.'s operations here are illegal, immoral, wasteful and downright stupid," Mr. Rivoir said in a report to a regional advisory panel of officials and private-sector executives from six Southwestern states.
"Even worse, the problem lies at the very core of the R.T.C., and it will take a complete overhaul of the system to rectify it," he said.
 
A Litany of Problems
 Mr. Rivoir, a Republican appointed two and a half years ago by a Democratic governor, described a litany of bureaucratic problems, including instances in which asset managers had no understanding of the local markets, low quality appraisals making sales impossible and lawyers hired by the trust corporation who did not look at costs or consequences.
"This situation is serious," Mr. Rivoir said. "It is destroying our local real estate market, it is shrinking our property tax base, it is hindering the bonding ability of local jurisdictions, and more to the point, it is causing the R.T.C. to accomplish exactly the opposite of its stated goals, which are to manage the acquisition of assets from failed savings and loans and to dispose of those assets with the highest possible net recovery for the Government and the taxpayer."
Mr. Seidman declined comment today on Mr. Rivoir's assessment. On Wednesday, a Senate banking subcommittee will hear from private-sector critics and defenders of the trust corporation.
Although a single board runs both the deposit corporation and Resolution Trust, the savings and loan bailout is also supervised by an Oversight Board whose nucleus consists of Treasury Secretary Brady, the Housing and Urban Development Secretary, Jack F. Kemp, and Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve.
 
New 9-Member Board
 Mr. Seidman's proposal would eliminate the deposit corporation as manager of the trust corporation by merging the Oversight Board and the board of Resolution Trust into a new nine-member board.
"The time has clearly passed when operational control over the R.T.C. by the F.D.I.C. board is necessary," Mr. Seidman said in the draft of his testimony. "The current structure is functioning, and the corporation is up and running. However, any system that embraces two boards creates possible confusion with regard to accountability and can make the day-to-day operations more time-consuming. More importantly, some of the circumstances that guided Congress in establishing the operating framework have changed."
Under his proposal, the President would appoint the trust corporation's chief executive. The current director, David Cooke, is a career deposit insurance official appointed to Resolution Trust by Mr. Seidman.
Mr. Seidman's plan also calls for a three-person executive committee to be formed with the chief executive, an official from the deposit insurance board and a representative of the Treasury. The committee would act on behalf of the board in emergenices or in other situations when authority is delegated.
 
Out of the Nest
 Elaborating on his testimony in an interview this afternoon, Mr. Seidman said the proposal was intended to "streamline the structure," adding, "The R.T.C. has grown up now, so it's time to kick it out of the nest,"
Mr. Seidman also said that Resolution Trust had spent $113 billion since it was created nearly two years ago, and that it expected to recover $58 billion by selling assets from failed savings associations.
Last year Mr. Brady estimated that the bailout might cost as much as $130 billion from the start of the rescue effort in 1989. The Administration stands by that estimate. In terms of present values, Mr. Seidman said that $130 billion in 1989 translates to roughly $160 billion today.

HEADLINE: 7 Industrial Nations Plan Meeting On Soviet Aid and Rise of Dollar

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
The Finance Ministers and central bank presidents of the Group of Seven industrial democracies are hastily trying to arrange a meeting for this weekend, perhaps in New York, to discuss aid to the Soviet Union and what to do about the sharply rising American dollar.
A Treasury Department spokeswoman said yesterday afternoon that "active discussions" concerning such a meeting were under way, but that a final decision had not been made. The issue was not whether to hold the meeting -- that has already been decided, by all accounts -- but whether the session can be scheduled on short notice. 
 "They don't want to go to the economic summit without having some idea of what they are going to tell the Soviet Union about aid," said Stanley Fischer, former chief economist at the World Bank. Government officials offered a similar explanation, although none wanted to be quoted by name.
 
A Preparatory Meeting
 He referred to the meeting July 15 to 17 in London of the leaders of the Group of Seven: Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States. The Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, is to meet with these chiefs on the final day at the conclusion of their gathering.
To prepare for the summit, the Finance Ministers of these same countries would gather this weekend, probably in New York but perhaps London, along with each nation's central bank president. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, would represent the United States.
The Soviet aid issue is essentially the need to reach agreement on a set of conditions that the Soviet Union would have to fulfill to qualify for aid, whether it is the $20 billion a year that a group of Harvard and Soviet economists have proposed, among them Mr. Fischer, or a lesser amount.
"You have to agree on certain basic steps that the Soviets must take, like enacting a treaty of confederation and a satisfactory agreement on economic union," Mr. Fischer said.
 
The Rising Dollar
 The meeting would also prepare the way for summit discussions of another major issue: how to coordinate economic policies now that the United States recession is apparently coming to an end. The immediate issue is the dollar, now rising sharply against the German mark and the Japanese yen.
"Maybe they'll try for an agreement on a ceiling for the dollar's value," said David Smick, a Washington economic consultant.
A connected issue is how to adjust interest rates in each country to accommodate an American economy that might be coming out of recession. Lower interest rates in the United States would be one way to weaken the dollar, by making investments in dollar-denominated securities less attractive. But the Federal Reserve is not likely to reduce rates at a moment when the recession might be ending.

HEADLINE: Yeltsin Comes to U.S. With Aura and New Power

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, June 18

 BODY:
Boris N. Yeltsin left for the United States today as the Soviet man of the hour, adorned with the mantle of the first popularly elected Russian President and champion of a rapid transition to private enterprise.
His trip, and especially the invitation to the White House, was a notable achievement for a politician who was dumped from the Soviet Communist Party Politburo by Mikhail S. Gorbachev three years earlier and snubbed by Washington two years ago. 
 Now, outside the party, Mr. Yeltsin stands almost as Mr. Gorbachev's political equal, a man both the Kremlin and the West have to reckon with.
"Russia is becoming very independent, in foreign policy as well," he declared as he prepared to board a flight that arrived in Washington hours later. "So the best thing is to hold a dialogue with both Gorbachev and Yeltsin, not only with one figure in mind."
 
A Lure to Foreign Capital
 Mr. Yeltsin said he was not going "with outstretched hands to ask for credits." He promised, over time, to create conditions in Russia that would have foreigners rushing over "with great willingness."
His mission in the United States was "to have a dialogue with politicians, to look, to study how to organize executive power, to create contacts with the White House," and to meet politicians and businessmen.
Although the trip follows Mr. Yeltsin's electoral triumph last week, it was planned some time ago when he accepted an invitation from Senate leaders for a four-day visit to Washington and New York. An invitation from President Bush to meet with him at the White House on Thursday, however, was the direct result of his victory.
But if Mr. Yeltsin's rise sometimes leads Western analysts to view him as a potential alternative for Mr. Gorbachev, his talk of "both Gorbachev and Yeltsin" was a reminder that he had fought the Soviet Government not to seize it, but to bring it to heel.
He has sought to wrest enough power from the Kremlin, the Communist Party and the military-industrial complex to enable the 15 Soviet republics to enact radical reforms and to shape a new union, in which they would delegate authority over defense, transportation and energy to Mr. Gorbachev's central Government.
His victory at the polls last week, Mr. Yeltsin said at the airport, marked three major achievements. One was the first free election of a President in Russian history, he said. The second was the triumph of democratic forces all across the Russian republic, by far the largest of the 15. "The third," he said, "is that executive power has been turned from bottom to top. The election strengthened this power."
While Mr. Yeltsin's powers remain somewhat vague and ill-defined, it was a measure of his success that as he flew off, negotiators from nine republics sent the draft of a new union treaty to their capitals for discussion, and a radical new plan for economic cooperation with the West was getting serious attention in the Kremlin.
Even more telling, perhaps, was that Mr. Yeltsin left with a public blessing from Mr. Gorbachev. The Soviet President declared through his spokesman that he had discussed the trip with Mr. Yeltsin and considered it "very useful" and a "positive process that significantly broadens the foreign policy activities of the Soviet Union."
Those were startling words from a man whose resignation Mr. Yeltsin had demanded, and who so disliked Mr. Yeltsin that he had sent 50,000 troops into Moscow streets only three months ago to try to block a pro-Yeltsin rally.
Now the two are acting in grudging concert -- not friends perhaps, but at least conscious of a mutual dependence.
 
Why Gorbachev Needs Yeltsin
 Mr. Gorbachev, preparing to go to London next month to seek help from skeptical Western leaders, was aware that he might not have been invited without the truce with Mr. Yeltsin.
Mr. Yeltsin, for his part, seemed to recognize that for all his popularity and political skill, he could not acquire enough of the levers of power to put his policies into practice single-handed. Sixty percent of the Russian republic's industry, for example, is associated with the military and so is controlled by the Kremlin.
The months of bitter feuding between the two men ended when Mr. Gorbachev joined Mr. Yeltsin and the leaders of eight other Soviet republics on April 23 to hammer out a truce in which Mr. Gorbachev acknowledged sovereign powers of the republics and they agreed to help restore economic order.
In an interview with Izvestia last month, Mr. Yeltsin cited that meeting as a victory for the democracy and workers' movements, which had answered Mr. Gorbachev's shift to the right with quickening protests.
By the time of the truce, Mr. Yeltsin said, "I think the President understood that he has to lean on his left shoulder, even if from the center, that this is how he can move forward."
From the very start, Mr. Yeltsin seemed to catch the popular imagination. In the style of Lyndon B. Johnson or Helmut Kohl, he is a rough-hewn, home-grown professional politician with a disarming earthiness and a keen sense of the streets.
While the dissident Andrei D. Sakharov achieved the status of a prophet, Mr. Yeltsin entered the popular imagination as someone many could identify with -- a Communist who conceded that he had been wrong, a man with human weaknesses, a worker who learned from life and experience and rarely made the same mistake twice.
He has been consistent, however, in badgering Mr. Gorbachev and the Communists to move faster.
"You have to see the main thing," he said to Izvestia. "Partial reforms, gradual implemented reforms -- this will destroy us. The people won't put up with this.
"When they say that it's logical to stretch reforms over years, this is not for us," he added. "That's for a society where a tolerable level of life has been achieved and where people can wait. We have such a critical situation, plus such a massive bureaucratic system, that you have to finish with them not gradually, but radically."
His demands came to include a rapid transition to a market economy and the sale of state enterprises, the right to own and farm private land, and the ouster of Communist organizations from all enterprises and bureaucracies. He championed republican sovereignty, the institution of democracy at all levels of society, and the restoration of national heritages.
It was Mr. Yeltsin's instinct and luck to be at the forefront of shifts in the fortunes of perestroika, the program of economic and political restructuring. He accused the conservatives of half-hearted reform just as the first euphoria over perestroika began to fade. He was ousted from the Politburo as Mr. Gorbachev began to lose some of his glitter.
He called for radical reform and decentralization when the momentum of change waned, he quit the Communist Party last summer at a time it was coming to be identified with the forces of reaction, and he became chairman of the Russian Parliament as republics rebelled against the Kremlin.
Thus, by the time Mr. Gorbachev shifted to the right last fall, Mr. Yeltsin stood as a beacon for the many forces that opposed the central Government.
The liberal intellectuals and economists who had argued for a rapid transition -- including Grigory Yavlinsky, the economist who has been developing a new model of Soviet-Western cooperation -- found a haven with Mr. Yeltsin. Russian patriots flocked to the leader who argued for a restoration of Russia's sovereignty. And anti-Communists cheered for the man who demanded an end to all Communist meddling.
Mr. Yeltsin, though, never forgot the people who worked for the vast apparatus in which he had worked for 20 years as a party official. He sought to attract workers in the military-industrial complex and liberal Communists, taking an Afghanistan hero who led a faction of reformist Communists as his running mate.

HEADLINE: Petrochemical Disasters Raise Alarm in Industry

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHARLESTON, S. C., June 18

 BODY:
The blast that killed six workers at a chemical plant here on Monday was the latest in a streak of fires, explosions and poison-gas leaks at refineries and chemical plants around the nation.
Since October 1987, when a leak of hydrogen fluoride gas at a Marathon Oil refinery forced the evacuation of thousands in Texas City, Tex., the American petrochemical industry has endured one of the deadliest periods in its history, one that has baffled Government experts and alarmed company executives. The 12 worst explosions have killed 79 people, injured 933 and caused roughly $2 billion in damage. 
 In the most recent big blast before the one here Monday at the Albright & Wilson Americas plant, an explosion May 1 at the Angus Chemical Company in Sterlington, La., killed 8 workers, injured 128 workers and residents, wrecked businesses and ruined so many homes that 23 families are still living in motels.
The explosion at Albright & Wilson Americas, a subsidiary of Tenneco, occurred as workers were mixing chemicals to make a flame retardant used in textiles. Twenty-one employees and two firefighters were injured.
 
Are There Any Links?
 Oil and chemical industry executives acknowledge the recent increase in serious accidents, but they say they do not know if there is a common link. A petroleum trade group has begun a study to determine if there is a thread.
But independent safety experts and industry unions point to several trends that they say have made plants and refineries more dangerous: a growing dependence on the use of outside contractors, slipping safety standards, improper and inadequate training, flaws in engineering and design, old and deteriorating equipment, and a more aggressive drive for profits.
Gordon Strickland, assistant vice president of the Chemical Manufacturers Association, the industry's policy group in Washington, said that safety and training are improving. He denied that any of these factors were causing the rash of problems.
"The accidents that have occurred, it seems, all have different causes," he said. "The consequence is that one cannot nail it down to design or maintenance or whatever. And I don't believe that safety is anything but a first-line interest and concern in our industry."
 
The Death Rate Doubles
 An independent research group in Chicago, the National Safe Workplace Institute, said that the fatality rate from 1971, when the Occupational Safety and Health Administration was established, until the early 1980's was less than 10 a year. Over the past four years, the rate has been has been more than double that.
In 1987, according to the institute, the number of deaths and injuries in the petrochemical industry began to rise steadily. In 1989, an explosion at the Phillips Petroleum plastics plant in Pasadena, Tex., killed 23 workers. A year later, 17 workers were killed at an ARCO Chemical Company plant in Channelview, Tex. In the first six months of this year, 23 workers have died in five accidents.
The safety group based its estimate on news articles and interviews with business executives, labor groups, and Government officials.
On Monday, in the Charleston accident, 6 workers were killed and 23 injured when a chemical reactor apparently exploded without warning. Investigators from the company and the State Labor Department have not determined the cause of the explosion.
But some aspects of the explosion described today by the plant's general manager and several workers were reminiscent of previous accidents: It occurred soon after a week-long shutdown; many of the workers killed or injured were contract workers, not plant employees, and new controls were being installed.
At this stage in the investigation there is no way to know if any of these factors contributed to the accident. And there is not a Federal agency that compiles statistics and investigates every accident the way the National Transportation Safety Board does, for example, with air crashes.
Although amendments to the Clean Air Act signed into law in 1990 established a Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board, the White House has yet to appoint any members or provide funds.
The White House, in a statement, said it has not acted because of concerns over the structure of the board, how its activities will be coordinated with the Environmental Protection Agency and OSHA, and whether it will function as an independent group or under the jurisdiction of the President.
But Mr. Strickland of the chemical manufacturers group said there should be no delay: "Congress intended for the board to be established rapidly, and the events we see today suggest it should be expedited as quickly as possible."
OSHA now conducts investigations at accident sites, but its findings are often kept secret, pending the outcome of court cases involving penalties or, in rare cases, criminal charges.
 
'We Live in Toxic City'
 In the cities and towns that are host to the nation's 2,300 refineries and chemical processing plants, more and more workers and residents are asking whether the disasters are a coincidence, or an urgent signal.
"We live in toxic city, and it is very scary," said Bebe Lising, 39, a resident of Texas City and chairwoman of the Galveston-area chapter of the Sierra Club. "People have been kept so in the dark, and a lot of jobs are dependent on the industry. Our local health department is understaffed, and the plants monitor themselves."
Labor Department reviews show that the rate of injuries in refining and chemical plants is half the national rate for all manufacturing industries and has been declining. But the statistics do not take into account deaths and injuries suffered by employees of engineering and construction companies that work under contract.
Contract workers, whose numbers are rising in chemical and refining plants, are generally paid less and perform more dangerous duties than full-time workers. Mistakes by these workers have been linked to many of the most serious accidents, including a disaster in October 1989 at the Phillips Petroleum plant near Houston that killed 23 workers and injured 232 people.
A study commissioned by OSHA determined last year that contract workers had much higher turnover rates than regular employees, received far less training and were much less aware of safety procedures in the event of an accident. The study, by the John Grey Institute of Lamar University in Texas, found that contract laborers were "routinely instructed to run in the event of an emergency," leaving regular employees to fight fires and shut down pumps and pipelines.
OSHA, a unit of the Department of Labor, is proposing a rule to require companies to give more training to contract workers. The American Petroleum Institute, the oil industry's principal trade group, has urged the Department of Labor to change its practices and report injury and accident statistics for all employees plant by plant.
Six months ago, the Petroleum Institute also started a study to see if any of the accidents had common characteristics. The study may be completed before the end of the year.
"There is great attention given to safety," said Charles Thomas Sawyer, vice president of industry affairs at the Petroleum Institute. "Is there a common reason for all of these accidents? I don't know the answer to that right now."
Last year, Congress directed OSHA and the E.P.A. to require companies to conduct studies of the potential castastrophic hazards of their plants and to submit plans for preventing accidents.
OSHA has almost finished its regulations. The E.P.A. has until 1993 to finish its regulations, which are aimed at modernizing equipment and improving manufacturing. Next month, the E.P.A. is scheduled to meet with state officials from New Jersey and California, the first states to establish rules for preventing chemical disasters.
The operating weaknesses in the petrochemical industry, say independent experts, may be the result of the aggressive cost cutting prompted by the corporate takeovers and mergers of the 1980's. To protect themselves from takeovers, or to finance the mergers, oil and chemical companies greatly increased production even as they cut costs and staff.
 
Job Totals Are Slashed
 More than 40,000 jobs have been cut in the refinery industry since 1982, according to the Petroleum Institute, leaving about 115,000 refinery workers. About 30,000 hourly jobs were lost in the chemical industry, according to the Oil, Chemical, and Atomic Workers International Union. Phillips Petroleum employed 30,000 people before it came under attack by T. Boone Pickens in the mid-1980's. By October 1989, when its chemical complex near Houston exploded, it employed 22,000.
"No sector of the economy was affected more by the raiders than the oil and chemical industry," said Joseph A. Kinney, director of the National Safe Workplace Institute. "Workers are paying for it with their blood."
Industry executives say cutting costs has not affected safety. But OSHA is studying operations at 25 plants across the Gulf Coast, the East and the Midwest to determine whether that is so.

HEADLINE: Notaries Certify That Inflation Has Arrived

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 18

 BODY:
The 30-year wait is over. Alfred E. Piombino and the 244,383 men and women represented by the New York State Association of Notaries Public -- of which he is president -- are finally getting some justice.
Since 1961, the state's notaries public have been allowed to charge no more than 25 cents every time they certify a deed, deposition, affidavit, contract or complaint. That is the lowest fee, along with those in Iowa and Massachusetts, of any state in the nation. 
 "It's an insult," said Mr. Piombino. "It's an injustice." But now, it is about to become history.
Under a measure passed by state lawmakers (many of whom are notaries public) and signed into law recently by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo (also a notary public), notaries can soon begin charging $2.
That is not exactly a huge amount and many notaries, including Mr. Cuomo, say they intend to keep right on with their present practice of not charging anything at all. That partly explains why legislation increasing the fees never seems to have become a burning issue here.
Still, to Mr. Piombino and many other notaries who have been crusading for the bill, its passage at least indicates a renewed measure of esteem for the notary's calling.
 
'A Bit More Dignity'
 "There's a respect factor involved here," said Mr. Piombino, a notary law consultant by profession. "Suppose right now you bring me a document and I say to you, 'That will be a quarter,' it sounds kind of absurd. To say, 'Two dollars,' that has a bit more dignity to it."
The state's notary fees have always seemed immune from inflation. Prior to 1961, the last time the Legislature raised the top price of a notary's seal was in 1907, when notaries were allowed to earn 6 cents for swearing a witness and 12 cents for taking an affidavit. For certain more complex duties, the notary could make a quarter, a respectable sum in those days.
With the latest jump in notary fees, even those who plan to continue notarizing without charge, as a matter of public service, seem to appreciate the new law.
 
Matter of Convenience
 "Our personal policy is that to charge a quarter is so ridiculous that we don't charge anything," said Richard Clark, the manager of the Tebbutt Funeral Home in Albany. "So now it's two dollars, we still won't charge anything. But at least it sounds like a more reasonable fee."
For many notaries like Mr. Clark, who said he hopes that "people will remember we did something nice for them some day," the chief attraction to being a notary seems to be that the service can draw customers into their place of business. Many pharmacists, as well as a few barbers and newsstand dealers, are notaries, for instance.
And for lawyers and bankers, who routinely deal with documents like mortgages and deeds that require notarization, being able to provide the notary stamp is a matter of convenience.
Still, the potential for making money is not inconsiderable, particularly with the eight-fold increase in fees that goes into effect July 24.
There are millions and millions of documents notarized in New York and around the nation each year, but nobody is able to keep an exact count.
"Some notaries notarize several times a day," said Eugene E. Hines, the executive director of the American Society of Notaries, a Washington group that represents the country's 4 million notaries public.
 
Exam Required
 "But a lot only do it once every two or three months," he continued. "I would guess the average for all notaries is probably about once a week, but that's only a wild guess."
The requirements -- and the fees -- for becoming a notary public vary considerably from state to state. One of the things that irks Mr. Piombino and other New York notaries is that even as New York has the lowest allowable fees, it has some of the strictest standards.
It is one of only a handful of states, for instance, that require aspiring notaries to take a written examination. And it charges $30 for a two-year term of office, while most other states charge less than that for longer terms.
Other states place far less rigorous standards on their notaries. An official with the National Notary Association, the other principal group representing notaries, said last year that "in some states, if somebody puts a mirror in front of your mouth and it fogs up, you can become a notary."
In Michigan, where the main requirement is a written application and state residency, more than 100 state prisoners became notaries last year. ("Mainly for the prestige," said Mr. Hines at the American Society of Notaries. "There isn't much to notarize in prison.")
While there are virtually no full-time notaries anywhere, the job does seem to carry a higher degree of prestige in other states than in New York, Mr. Piombino said. For instance, he pointed out, three states -- Maine, Florida and South Carolina -- allow their notaries to perform marriages.
And even with the new law here authorizing the $2 fees, New York's notaries still trail well behind many of their brethren elsewhere in what they can charge for their services. California and Texas both allow notaries to collect $5 fees, and Florida recently passed a law allowing $10 charges. Some states, including Maine and Vermont, put no limit at all on what notaries can charge.

HEADLINE: BIG INSURER OFFERS POLICIES TO COVER MEDICAL SCREENING

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 18

 BODY:
In a departure from longstanding practice in the health insurance industry, which has emphasized the treatment and cure of disease without paying for much preventive care, Blue Cross and Blue Shield offered today to provide insurance for periodic tests to detect medical problems in people with no symptoms of an ailment.
The Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association issued guidelines for a lifetime schedule of medical tests to detect adult diseases, including cancer and heart disease, and said it would offer coverage for these services. The United States Public Health Service expressed support for the guidelines, giving insurers an additional incentive to adopt them. 
 Other private insurers have expressed a willingness to cover preventive services and are expected to use the guidelines.
 
An Economic Investment
 The screening tests would add to overall national spending on health care at a time when the soaring costs of medicine have prompted a flurry of proposals in Congress for fundamental change in the nation's health-care system. But the concern about cost usually focuses on exotic high-technology procedures, not on simple screening tests, and Blue Cross officials described the coverage of preventive care as an investment that would yield economic gains, including higher productivity for workers.
The new coverage is envisioned as an optional addition to existing policies. Blue Cross said it could cover the costs of insurance for preventive and screening services by charging additional premiums of about $90 a year for a family and $36 a year for an individual.
 
Growing Public Demand
 The guidelines come in response to a nationwide consensus of health policy experts that insurers should cover more preventive services. That idea is backed not only by the Public Health Service but by the 70,000-member American College of Physicians. The college developed the guidelines over several years in cooperation with the Blue Cross and Blue Shield system, which is the nation's largest private health insurer, covering 73 million Americans.
Health economists suggested that Blue Cross was also motivated by a sense of enlightened self-interest, because there appears to be a growing demand among employers and consumers for insurance to cover screening and preventive care, including health education and counseling to stop smoking.
The screening schedule specifies who should be tested when for high blood pressure, heart disease, cholesterol, diabetes, thyroid problems, osteoporosis and cancers of the breast, colon, cervix and lung.
Equally important, the guidelines say certain techniques, like exercise stress testing and tests for thyroid disease, are not recommended as routine screening procedures for people with no symptoms.
Dr. Paul F. Griner, chairman of the board of regents of the American College of Physicians, said that screening -- the search for specific health problems in a person who has no known signs or symptoms -- "has enormous medical value in finding disease early, when it can be treated most successfully and most economically."
In the last year, many private insurers have quietly cut back coverage of small groups of beneficiaries on which they say they have lost money. But Pam Kelch, a spokeswoman for Blue Cross and Blue Shield, said the medical tests included in the new benefits package would not be used to screen out people found to have costly diseases or a high risk of developing such illneses.
Bernard R. Tresnowski, president of Blue Cross and Blue Shield, said the group's 73 local plans around the country could offer coverage of the recommended screening tests for "a nominal amount," about $7.50 a month for a family whose insurance coverage now typically costs $200 to $300 a month. The Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans often charge a standard premium for family coverage, regardless of the number in the family.
Dr. David M. Eddy, professor of health policy management at Duke University, who edited the guidelines, estimated that national spending on health care would increase by $2 billion to $3 billion a year if all adults complied with the screening recommendations.
 
'Improved Productivity'
 But Dr. Griner said the extra spending would result in "improved productivity of employees, greater longevity and improved quality of life" for millions of people. Americans spend more than $660 billion a year on health care, and the amount has doubled in the last eight years.
The guidelines are not rigid standards, but doctors who ignore them could expose themselves to an increased risk of lawsuits for failure to detect cancer or other diseases.
Dr. Griner, who is also the chief executive officer of Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester, said that 80 percent of the women who should be getting routine mammography were not.
To detect breast cancer, the guidelines say that women 40 years old and over should receive an annual examination of the breasts by a doctor or a specially trained nurse. In addition, the guidelines recommend annual mammography for women 40 and older who have a personal history of breast cancer or have a sister or mother with the disease. For women with no such history or risk, the guidelines call for annual mammograms starting at age 50.
Under the model benefit package for preventive services, Blue Cross would not pay for routine physical examinations, but would cover many procedures commonly performed in such examinations.
 
Health Official Hails Plan
 The 73 independent nonprofit Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans will be strongly encouraged but not required to offer the additional coverage to groups of subscribers, who would also have the option of taking it. The plans operate 89 health maintenance organizations providing care for 4.6 million people. Routine exams and screening tests are already included in the services of such prepaid group plans. The new coverage is being offered to people who receive health care through traditional fee-for-service arrangements.
Joel E. Miller, director of professional services for the Health Insurance Association of America, which represents more than 300 commercial insurers, said some of them were beginning to offer similar benefits. But he said: "Major employers call the shots. They decide what benefits to include in their health insurance packages. There needs to be a marketing and education campaign to convince employers that these benefits should be included."
Medicare, the Federal health insurance program for the elderly, is slowly adding coverage for a few selected screening tests, like mammograms. Medicaid, the Federal-state program for poor people, already covers screening for many children and coverage of other services generally depends on state decisions.
Dr. J. Michael McGinnis, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services, hailed today's announcement by Blue Cross and the College of Physicians. "Historically, lack of financing has been a barrier to the delivery of clinical preventive services," he said. "A recent survey of insurance coverage for preventive services revealed that overall only 41 percent of insured adults were covered for preventive exams, and only 69 percent of preventive diagnostic tests were covered by these insurance policies."
The guidelines address these diseases, among others:
*Cervical cancer. A Pap smear is recommended every three years, beginning at the age of 20, for women who have an average risk of cervical cancer, and every one to two years for women at high risk.
*Colon-rectal cancer. Annual screening for blood in the stool is recommended for people 50 and older. Examination of the colon with a fiberoptic tube known as a sigmoidoscope is recommended every three to five years for people 50 and older.
*Coronary artery disease. Cholesterol tests are recommended at least once in early adulthood and then at intervals of about five years.
*High blood pressure. Screening is recommended every one or two years for adults with blood pressure below 140/85. People with higher blood pressure should be checked annually.
Dr. McGinnis said that the development of a model package of benefits by Blue Cross was a significant step, but only a beginning.

HEADLINE: Construction Of Homes Up 0.1% in May

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 18

 BODY:
Construction of new homes and apartments inched up by a tenth of a percent in May, the Commerce Department said today in a report that supported forecasts by analysts of a slower-than-normal housing recovery.
"We're not expecting an increase in housing starts at the torrid pace of past recoveries," said Richard Peach, an economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association. 
 David F. Seiders, chief economist with the National Association of Home Builders, concurred, saying, "We're moving along at a subpar recovery pace."
 
Comments by Greenspan
 Release of the home-building figures coincided with comments by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve's chairman, who testified before the House Ways and Means Committee, where he said the United States economy appeared to have bottomed out but showed no signs of recovering from the recession.
The Commerce Department said housing starts totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 982,000, up from a revised 981,000 in April and 907,000 in March.
But despite the sluggish pace, the increase was the first back-to-back advance since June and July 1989 and the third gain since starts plunged to 847,000 units in January.
 
Lowest Since January 1982
 The January level was the lowest since an 843,000 rate in January 1982, in the midst of the previous recession. Analysts said it represented the bottom of the current housing downturn.
The 8.2 percent gain in April was even stronger than the 6.2 percent originally reported. But the 8.6 percent decline in March was not as steep as the 9.2 percent first reported.
But the May activity was concentrated in single-family construction. New construction of single-family homes rose 3.1 percent, to an 832,000 annual rate, after a 8.8 percent jump a month earlier, the Commerce Department said.
Multifamily starts, on the other hand, fell 13.8 percent, to a 150,000 rate. Starts of buildings with five units or more plunged 16.3 percent, to a 118,000 level, the lowest since record-keeping began in 1963.
 
Fourth Consecutive Rise
 Applications for building permits rose 7.2 percent, to a 979,000 annual rate. It was the fourth consecutive monthly increase in permits and the longest string since a similar stretch from April through July 1983 following the previous recession.
The rise in starts has also been accompanied by an increase in new-home sales since January. Inventories of unsold homes fell to a 7.4-month supply in April from a 9.3-month backlog in January.
Starts soared 17.7 percent in the Northeast after falling 7.7 percent in April. They were up 14 percent in the West, where new construction rose 33.7 percent the previous month. However, starts fell 8.8 percent in the Midwest, wiping out a 5.3 percent April gain. And they tumbled 7.6 percent in the South, where they rose 1.8 percent a month earlier.

HEADLINE: U.S. Is Said to Offer to Back Israel With Veto in U.N.

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER

 BODY:
The Bush Administration has assured Israel that the United States would veto any United Nations Security Council resolution affecting the Middle Eastern peace process as long as peace talks were under way, people close to efforts to convene such talks say.
The proposal is aimed at breaking the deadlock over efforts to convene an international peace conference on the Middle East. It was made in a letter to the Israeli Prime Minister, Yitzhak Shamir, which was given to the Israeli Foreign Minister, David Levy. 
 Mr. Levy has just completed a five-day trip to the United States during which he met with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and leaders of American Jewish organizations.
A senior Administration official said the "bottom line" was that Mr. Baker would not take Israel's objections to an international conference as a definitive "no" to American-led efforts to settle the Arab-Israeli conflict by convening such a conference.
According to published reports, Mr. Shamir has ruled out a United Nations role in the peace talks. He has also insisted on Israel's right to veto proposed members of a Jordanian-Palestinian negotiating team. The latest American proposal is intended to help overcome Israel's unwillingness to permit even a symbolic role at any peace talks by the United Nations, which Israel views as hostile to its interests.
In a meeting on Thursday with leaders of prominent American Jewish organizations, Mr. Baker gave a detailed presentation of the status of his discussions with Israel and the Arab countries. Participants said he told them the Administration was awaiting a reply from Syria to a letter from President Bush asking it for concessions. But officials said Saudi Arabia and Egypt had assured the Administration that the Syrian President, Hafez al-Assad, was willing "to be flexible" if Israel would take part in peace talks.
Dennis Ross, a senior aide to Mr. Baker, was quoted by one participant as having told the gathering that considerable progress had been made in efforts to convene a conference. Specifically, he was said to have cited an agreement by Saudi Arabia to meet directly with Israel in multilateral talks about issues affecting the region -- environment, water resources, arms control and economic development.
Henry Siegman, executive director of the American Jewish Congress, who attended the meeting, said Prince Bandar bin Sultan, Saudi Arabia's representative at the United Nations, had assured him that if a peace process got under way, Saudi Arabia would participate directly in multilateral talks about such problems of regional concern as shipping and pollution.
 
Role for P.L.O. Ruled Out
 Participants in the meeting with Mr. Baker said all parties to efforts to convene a peace conference had agreed that the Palestine Liberation Organization would not be present directly or indirectly at the talks and that the United States would not consult with it directly or indirectly. All sides were also said to have agreed that Palestinian members of a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation could not be connected to the P.L.O., that they would not raise anything other than interim arrangements for the occupied territories and that they must be willing to agree to live in peace with Israel and to renounce war and terrorism.
The American proposal calls for a three-stage conference: first, a ceremonial opening session attended directly by Israel and its Arab neighbors and indirectly by Saudi Arabia and the other Persian Gulf states through a representative of a gulf defense and assistance group; a second phase, following almost immediately, of bilateral talks between Israel and its neighbors to discuss borders and peace, and a third stage, consisting of a multilateral conference on regional problems attended directly by Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia and Israel.

HEADLINE: Filipinos, Assessing Cost, Begin Volcano Cleanup

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANILA, June 18

 BODY:
Cities and villages across thousands of square miles of the Philippines began today to dig out from a thick blanket of volcanic ash released in a week of eruptions by Mount Pinatubo.
The nearly 300,000 residents of Olongapo, a city adjoining the United States Navy base at Subic Bay, continued to be plagued by food and water shortages resulting from the eruptions, and there were reports of looting. 
 In Manila, 50 miles southeast of the volcano, swirling clouds of the talc-like ash filled the air. Volcanic ash was reported to have fallen as far away as Singapore, 1,500 miles to the southwest.
The death toll from the eruption rose today to at least 140, as more bodies were discovered. But the volcano remained relatively quiet, with a few minor earth tremors and a small eruption that dumped more ash on Clark Air Base, 10 miles east of the crater.
Street vendors made quick money today by offering cloth surgical masks -- about 10 pesos, or 35 cents, each -- to Manila residents who preferred not to breathe the fine powder that was coating their cars and houses.
Farmers arriving at Manila evacuation centers from Zambales province, west of Mount Pinatubo, said their crops were buried under as much as three feet of ash and volcanic rock.
"There is nothing left," said Leonardo Mercado, 47 years old, who has a small farm near the city of Castillejos. "It is all ash and sand now. The roof of my house collapsed from all the ash."
 
Long Trek to Safety
 Mr. Mercado said that he and his family walked nearly 15 miles through ankle-deep ash to the city of Olongapo, where they boarded an evacuation bus to Manila.
At Subic Bay, officials said it could be two months or more before full electricity and water services were restored to the sprawling naval base. "From all the ash, it looks like a moonscape up here," said Lieut. Comdr. Kevin Mukri, a spokesman at the American-leased naval base.
Rescue workers said the momentous task of cleaning away the volcanic deposits had begun in earnest today in several communities on the main island of Luzon.
"People were just too stunned at first to think about a cleanup," said Frances Magdara, a rescue worker in the city of Angeles, next to Clark. "Now people are accepting what has happened. They can begin to put their lives together."
Philippine officials and Western diplomats said the cost of damage wrought by Mount Pinatubo would total hundreds of millions of dollars. The director of the National Economic and Development Authority, Cayetano Paderanga, said in an interview that the principal damage had been to crops. However, agriculture in the volcano region is only about 4 percent of the nation's total output.
Western diplomats said they believed that the chief economic harm might be a lessening of confidence by potential foreign investors.
"It's one more thing telling an investor to be wary," a diplomat said. "There are so many other problems with the Philippine economy. The volcano is just one more problem among many."
Reuters reported today that the main water supply in Olangapo had run out or was contaminated by ash, and residents were breaking pipes to drain off what little water remained.

HEADLINE: Learning in the Real World of a Boston School

BYLINE: By MARY B. W. TABOR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOWELL, Mass., June 13

 BODY:
After testimony and deliberation by a jury of his peers, Miguel Rivera stood tugging at his T-shirt, intently awaiting a verdict.
"Your honor, the jury finds the defendant, Miguel Rivera, guilty as charged," the jury foreman told the judge as she pushed aside her ponytail. Miguel glanced at his 12-year-old lawyer, Mark Lynch, with a look of dismay. 
 His offense: Choking another second grader on the playground. His defense: The boy called him a bad name. His sentence: A small fine and two days without recess.
Here at the Clement G. McDonough City Magnet School in Lowell, Mass., the cradle of this country's Industrial Revolution, students are taking part in a small revolution in education.
City Magnet, the nation's first school intended as a microcosm of society, not only has its own court system, but also a representative government and a market economy. Students work as judges, lawyers, editors, bankers and entrepreneurs; they pay rent on their desks and taxes on their salaries. They also buy and sell goods using paper currency called "mogans," named for a former Lowell superintendent, Patrick Mogan.
 
Work Is Made Relevant
 While they teach basic subjects like mathematics, literature and history using traditional texts, teachers also strive to make the work relevant. Adding and subtracting are used to balance bank statements. Instead of book reports, students write book reviews for the school newspaper. While programming computers, students learn lessons in geology.
In a 70-minute activity period at the end of the day, students either do assigned jobs or take part in running businesses or serving in the elected legislature.
"We have regular classes, but they are modeled to mirror outside society," Sue Ellen Hogan, the school's principal, said in a recent interview. "The activity period is to give them hands-on reinforcement."
Students in kindergarten through second grade receive a small salary in mogans for doing their homework and being good school citizens. Beginning in the third grade they are also given jobs and paid bigger salaries.
"Even if kids make it through high school, many of them don't come out with the kind of survival skills they need to make it in the outside world," said Theresa Roach, who teaches government and oversees the court at City Magnet. "This school gives them those skills."
 
Helped Desegregate Schools
 Opened in 1981 in response to a court order to desegregate, City Magnet is based on the ideas of George Richmond, a former Brooklyn public school teacher who first tried the concept and then wrote a book about it, "The Micro-Society School: A Real World in Miniature" (Harper & Row, 1974).
City Magnet has helped desegregate the schools in this working-class city, where 42 percent of the school's 330 students are from minority groups. More than half of the students are poor enough to qualify for free lunches.
Now in its 10th year, the school is also proving a model for educational change and success. Although many parents were initially skeptical, they have seen students' grades and attendance levels rise. There are fewer discipline problems. And, according to school officials, the number of parents waiting to get their children into the program is now the highest of any of the 28 schools in Lowell.
"You're lucky because your school is different," Lee A. Iacocca, chairman and chief executive officer of the Chrysler Corporation, told the eighth-graders at their graduation exercise Thursday night. "It has taught you more than just how to read and write and count. It has taught you about the real world, about the things you have to do in the real world, about how you have to accept responsibility, how you have to work together, and how to discover what you're good at and what you like to do."
Mr. Iacocca invited himself to the commencement after seeing a Public Broadcasting Service television documentary, sponsored by Chrysler, that featured the school.
City Magnet has served as a prototype for an elementary micro-society school in Yonkers, and several other communities are considering the concept.
At the Eugenio Hastos de Maria Micro-Society School, also known as Public School 19, in Yonkers, the program has brought major improvements. In 1987, when the micro-society school was first introduced, only one in four pupils was reading at grade level. Last year, tests showed that half the school's pupils were reading at grade level.
 
Changing School Makeup
 When the program was introduced, more than 90 percent of the pupils were Hispanic or black pupils; this fall, one-third will be white children whose families requested the micro-society magnet school.
"We think this is going to be one of our best elementary schools," said Donald M. Batista, the Yonkers superintendent. "We think micro-society is an extremely effective way to teach our youngsters, especially because we have so many children from other countries. This program helps them learn how to function in a strange society."
The Yonkers program, which is bilingual, also includes regular school visits from local officials and parents, who serve as role models for the students, Dr. Batista said.
Some students say they get tired of the micro-society activities after a few years and that students who are shy do not always fare well. But most teachers and students in Yonkers and in Lowell give the program high marks. It helps the students understand difficult concepts and builds confidence as well, they say.
"When I teach about the Great Depression, I talk to my students about how a depression would happen in their micro-society," Mrs. Roach said. "It's too hard a concept for their little minds to understand otherwise. But when I talk to them about it in micro, all of the little lights go on. They totally see it."
 
'You Learn About Everything'
 Amy Carrington, 13 years old, an 'A' student who left parochial school three years ago to come to City Magnet, agreed. "At my other school, it was really boring because they'd just give you a book," she said. "Here, you learn about everything."
What does she know now that her friends at other schools don't? "They know how to add and multiply and stuff," she said. "But I also know how to handle a bank book and a checkbook. I know how to fill out a tax form. They know how to write essays and reports. I also know how to write newspaper articles, from hard news to editorials.
 
Missing Link in High School
 "My dad works at a high-tech place, and he doesn't know half the stuff I know about newspapers and laws and computers," she added.
But an uncomfortable challenge for Amy may come next year when she enters Lowell High School. The transition from a micro-society school to normal teaching programs can be "very, very difficult," said Dr. Hogan, the City Magnet principal, not because the students cannot do traditional schoolwork but because they miss the attention, independence and responsibility they had in the micro-society school.
George Tsapatsaris, the Lowell schools superintendent, is trying to start a micro-society component at the high school. But Mr. Tsapatsaris must also watch the budget. The micro-society program, because of the requisite teacher preparation and supplies, costs about $50,000 a year more than is allotted by city and state budgets, Mr. Tsapatsaris said.
To date, Federal grants have made up for most of City Magnet's overrun, but the poor local economy has already forced the city to cut the school's supplies budget by 20 percent for next year.
"Even without the extra money, we would try to make this program work," the superintendent said. "The express purpose of this program has been to help all school kids succeed, and we believe the micro-society is doing that."

HEADLINE: SOVIET AID PLANS OUTLINED BY BAKER

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BERLIN, June 18

 BODY:
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d outlined a series of proposals today under which the United States and its allies could begin to help the Soviet Union out of its economic morass without the infusion of vast amounts of cash.
Although Mr. Baker did not explicitly rule out the large-scale cash aid sought by Moscow, his remarks suggested that the Administration would lobby with its Western allies not to rush into cash aid programs. 
 He included such proposals as support for Soviet associate membership in the International Monetary Fund, a program for encouraging American oil exploration in the Soviet Union and assistance in food distribution there. Mr. Baker's outline was part of a speech on European policy that he gave at the Aspen Institute in Berlin.
The question of how to help the Soviet Union has become acute because President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has been invited to meet with the leaders of the Group of Seven industrial democracies in London next month after their annual meeting is over. The allies are trying to come up with a consensus on dealing with Mr. Gorbachev.
The Secretary urged the peoples of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to join the "Atlantic Community," which used to be thought of as embracing just the United States, Canada and Western Europe. But to do so, Mr. Baker argued, the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe must first adopt systems of democratic pluralism and market economics.
He said that the United States "has a special role to play in supporting the process of change in the Soviet Union."
"As the Soviets demonstrate the will to help themselves, then we can and should join them, step by step," Mr. Baker said. "I hope President Gorbachev now brings forward a new effort at serious market reform. The door to the Euro-Atlantic community is open. But only the Soviets can decide to step over the threshold."
The notion of step-by-step assistance has become the byword of the Bush Administration when discussing economic aid to Moscow. It is in contrast to the notion of a "grand bargain" in which the West would commit a vast sum of money in return for, and to help cushion, specific Soviet economic and democratic reforms.
Last weekend, Grigory A. Yavlinsky, an independent Soviet economist who has been working with a group of Harvard University economists, presented a "grand bargain" plan to the Bush Administration and Mr. Gorbachev. Mr. Gorbachev was reported to have shown some interest in the plan, but Administration officials have not demonstrated much enthusiasm.
 
Alternative to 'Grand Bargain'
 The Administration, apparently feeling that if it does not like the grand bargain it had better come up with an alternative approach, began hinting a few weeks ago that it was developing a package of step-by-step "supportive measures" for the Soviet reform effort, but did not spell them out.
While saying today that the "complete package is for our President to announce," Mr. Baker nevertheless listed the key elements of what would be Washington's first steps in response to serious steps by the Soviets toward market reforms.
The ideas have all been proposed individually but are now being tied together in a package that is likely to be presented to Mr. Gorbachev.
"As we have pointed out in recent weeks," said Mr. Baker, "elements could include a special association with the I.M.F. and the World Bank to help design and implement serious economic reforms; a public-private project to resolve impediments to private investment in energy development, which can earn hard currency and provide an example of a successful sector operating with property and contract rights; a mutual effort to invigorate the food distribution sector to produce improvements for consumers soon through the establishment of market incentives."
He added that Washington was ready to support the conversion of Soviet defense industries to consumer and other nonmilitary production, would provide technical advice to promote education in market principles and practices and would advance more open trade -- an apparent reference to the impending decision to grant Moscow preferential trade benefits. Mr. Baker also listed in the package the $1.5 billion in additional credits to purchase American grain that President Bush granted the Soviet Union last week.
The rationale underlying virtually all of the Administration's proposals is that the Soviet Union is rich in natural resources and the educational development of its people, and that if it can establish the proper market incentives and inducements to foreign investment it will not need infusions of other governments' cash.
Mr. Baker argued that institutions like NATO, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and the European Community had to be used to help the eastern nations make the transition from Communism to democracy, so they would not fall prey to the sort of ethnic and nationalist fragmentation now racking Yugoslavia.
Mr. Baker did not offer much in the way of concrete new proposals. Rather, he attempted to show how many existing programs of NATO, the conference and the community could be used to extend democratic, free-market and federalist principles to the East.
 
Nationalism vs. Interdependence
 A way has to be found, Mr. Baker said, to balance the increasing demands of individuals in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to express their long-suppressed ethnic and national identities and the demands of an increasingly economically interdependent world, which requires integration with multinational and suprana tional economic institutions.
The 12-nation European Community, said Mr. Baker, has to continue removing economic barriers to Eastern European exports and expand its association agreements with Eastern European nations. As for the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Secretary proposed that it establish new agencies to promote market economics and private business among its membership, which includes all of Europe except Albania. He also suggested that the conference might develop a peacekeeping force to help defuse ethnic, national and border disputes when requested.

HEADLINE: Yeltsin Arrives in Washington With Conciliatory Words About Gorbachev

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 18

 BODY:
Fresh from his impressive victory as the first popularly elected president of the Russian republic, Boris N. Yeltsin arrived here today and sounded a conciliatory note about his political rival, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
Speaking at a hot and crowded reception at the Soviet Embassy tonight, Mr. Yeltsin said that "the fact that the people of Russia have had an opportunity to elect directly and for the first time ever by popular vote a President is first of all due to the initiative of the pro-democracy movement launched by President Gorbachev in 1985." 
 "Many men and women indeed doubted that our people were ready for that kind of change," he said.
Rejecting any idea that he or his country were supplicants for Western aid, Mr. Yeltsin said the first question he was asked when he arrived in Washington this afternoon, at the start of his four-day visit to Washington and New York, was, "How much money, Mr. President, are you going to beg?"
 
'We Have Not Come Here to Beg'
 "We have not come here to beg, we have not come here hat in hand," he said, speaking Russian that was translated by an interpreter. "We have come here to tell you the truth about the Russia of today."
His comments seemed to be a subtle effort to distinguish himself from Mr. Gorbachev, who has called for Western economic assistance to help the Soviet Union make the transition from Communism to a more Western-style economy.
Mr. Yeltsin, who has attracted a wide following in the Soviet Union, was clearly trying to capture some of the same positive attention here that Mr. Gorbachev has generated on his visits.
No sooner had he arrived at Andrews Air Force Base than he broke away from his security contingent to shake hands with spectators, in the sort of spontaneous pressing-the-flesh that has won Mr. Gorbachev so many admirers in America.
 
Mingling With the Crowd
 At the embassy tonight, Mr. Yeltsin quickly dispensed with formal protocol, abandoning the new Soviet Ambassador, Viktor G. Komplektov, in the receiving line, so he could move into the throngs and mingle more informally. Mr. Komplektov, for his part, had not relinquished his living quarters to Mr. Yeltsin in the gilt-laced downtown embassy, as the Soviet Ambassador has done during visits by Mr. Gorbachev. Mr. Yeltsin is staying at the Madison, a luxurious Washington hotel favored by foreign dignitaries.
Mr. Yeltsin wants to erase the bad memory left by his last visit to the United States in September 1989, when some reporters depicted him as indulging in a long drinking and shopping spree here, accounts that were reprinted in the Communist Party newspaper, Pravda. Pravda apologized to Mr. Yeltsin after encountering a storm of protest from readers and after several witnesses disputed many details in the unattractive profile, which first appeared in an Italian newspaper.
In contrast with his last visit to Washington, Mr. Yeltsin was somber and judicious in the delivery of his remarks, although an occasional flash of his customary puckishness came through.
Although the embassy was stocked with caviar in the heyday of Communism, there was none in sight tonight. The American and Soviet guests had to settle for cucumber and ham hors d'oeuvres and warm vodka.
 
New Envoy to Moscow
 The guests included President Bush's choice to be the new ambassador to Moscow, Robert S. Strauss, and his wife, Helen.
Mr. Strauss was greeted by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Jack Kemp, who laughingly told the ambassador-designate that "Gorby will have a hard time getting a word in edgewise with you in Moscow." Mr. Kemp, who was a quarterback for the Buffalo Bills before becoming a Republican Congressman, also advised Mr. Strauss to import professional football to Moscow.
Mr. Strauss said he has been so busy getting briefings from the State Department that he had postponed his Russian lessons until he gets to the Soviet Union.
 
'Stronger and Stable Interaction'
 Even though his visit is officially billed as private, Mr. Yeltsin had insisted on landing at the military air base used by the President and other Administration officials, as well as important foreign visitors, as a sign that the United States regards him with the proper degree of respect.
When he arrived at Andrews after the 11-hour flight from Moscow, Mr. Yeltsin said that he hoped his visit would "launch a direct dialogue between Russia and the United States in the interests of stronger and stable interaction between the U.S.S.R. and the United States."
He was met by the Senate Republican Leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, and the Senate Majority Leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine, who are acting as his hosts while he is in Washington.
Senator Dole told Mr. Yeltsin that his meetings with President Bush and top legislators "demonstrate the new reality of the Soviet Union and the Russian republic, a reality that we are perhaps a bit belatedly coming to accept."
The highest ranking Administration official who came to the airport was Curt Kamman, a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State in the Bureau of European Affairs.
The Bush Administration is engaged in a delicate choreography this week. Officials do not want to give Mr. Yeltsin too much attention, because that could annoy and undercut President Gorbachev. Yet they do not want to offend the proud and popular Russian politician, especially now that it seems that he is destined to be a potent force in the future of the Soviet Union.
 
Yeltsin 'Led the Way'
 "We want to convey the idea that we must deal with the central Government of the Soviet Union," said a senior White House official. "But we also want to encourage pluralism and convey that it is important for the Soviet Union to have elections and for Yeltsin to have led the way."
At his briefing today, the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, stressed that he does not want Mr. Yeltsin's reception to be seen as a challenge to Mr. Gorbachev's leadership.
"President Bush has met with the presidents of the other republics, as well as the Baltic states, and we certainly are anxious to meet with President Yeltsin as well," Mr. Fitzwater said, adding that "our relationship has been with the central Government of the Soviet Union for the last 40-some years, and that's the way it will remain. So there will be no change in that relationship."
State Department officials said that, when Mr. Bush meets with Mr. Yeltsin on Thursday for an hour, he will want to hear his plans for economic liberalization. "The President will want to know to what extent he's constrained by the central Government and to what extent he thinks he can move forward with these ambitious economic plans he's got," said a State Department official involved with the trip.
Mr. Yelstin said tonight on the ABC News program "Nightline" that he does not like Mr. Gorbachev very much because the Soviet President has shown "inconsistency, half-hearted decisions" and a tendency to change positions under pressure.
Since April, when Mr. Gorbachev, Mr. Yeltsin and leaders of eight other republics agreed to reorganize the union, President Gorbachev has been "more stable" and has kept his word, Mr. Yeltsin said through an interpreter.
Mr. Yeltsin was scheduled to appear on the NBC News program "Today" Wednesday morning, before spending a day on Capitol Hill meeting with leading lawmakers.

HEADLINE: Stocks Plunge in Tokyo

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: TOKYO, Wednesday, June 19

 BODY:
Prices fell sharply on the Tokyo Stock Exchange today on higher interest rates and the dollar's continued strength.
The Nikkei average of 225 issues plunged 688.72 points, or 2.79 percent, to close at 23,996.75. On Tuesday, the index fell 257.62 points. 
 Stock traders said there was a pessimistic mood in the market bacause of the dollar's strength and higher interest rates. Higher bond rates tend to indicate traders do not expect a fall in the prime lending rate soon.
Traders said the possibility of lower interest rates was eroded further by Tuesday's Japanese gross national product report, which showed continuing strenth in the economy. The Bank of Japan has been keeping interest rates high to cool the economy and stem inflation.
Brokers said there was selling by investment trusts and some index selling.
A drop in the Dow Jones industrial average, which lost 7.15 points on Tuesday, and heavy sell orders for September futures also helped push down the market.
"Today was a futures-led decline," said Chip Mesics, an equity salesman at Kidder Peabody International.
The dollar was trading at 140.90 yen by late this morning, down 0.16 yen from Tuesday's close. It opened at 141.08 yen.
Currency dealers said the dollar's higher opening followed its overnight advance in New York after remarks by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, that the American economy has hit bottom.

Maggie Joins Norman
Until a few months ago, Marvin Josephson, who owns the International Creative Management agency, had the most exclusive coterie of clients in town. It consisted of just two people: Barbara Walters and Henry Kissinger. But the list has now doubled in size. 
 The first addition was Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, whose proposed book is the object of hotly contested bidding that has reached the $5 million range. The houses still in the game are HarperCollins, Bantam, William Morrow, Alfred A. Knopf and Random House. (Persistent rumors that Disney Publishing is also in the running, with half an eye on developing beaming "Schwarzies" for the theme parks, are unfounded.)
The second newcomer to Mr. Josephson's private client list is Margaret Thatcher. The agent, who founded I.C.M. in 1955, said that he signed an agreement yesterday to represent the former British Prime Minister worldwide and would be offering her memoirs to publishing houses in the next few days.
Asked whether he expected the Iron Lady or the four-star Bear to fetch more money, Mr. Josephson, reached on vacation in Aspen, Colo., said, "I never discuss the money my clients get." Mrs. Thatcher is also expected to command a seven-figure sum.
Several American publishing houses -- including Bantam Doubleday Dell, HarperCollins and Random House Inc. -- now have British arms, and Mr. Josephson said these would be natural places for Mrs. Thatcher to publish her as yet untitled memoirs.
Both Mrs. Thatcher and General Schwarzkopf were pursued by several agents who made pilgrimages to London and Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Mr. Josephson, who is 64 years old, joined the trek to Europe and the Middle East. "I've been surprised by how competitive my juices still are," he said.
 
Disney Plays Hardball
 Although it did not enter the Schwarzkopf race, Disney Publishing, whose adult trade book arm is called Hyperion, has been making a big splash in its first year of activity. It has been bidding aggressively for both fiction and particularly non-fiction books, offering unusual incentives like 17.5 percent, rather than the traditional 15 percent, royalties on some deals.
For example, Robert Miller, the publisher, said it bid $500,000 for two books by Donna Tartt, a first novelist; $500,000 for the memoirs of Peter Arnett, the veteran journalist who was CNN 's man in Baghdad during the Persian Gulf war, $575,000 for "The Force" a nonfiction book by David Dorsey about the driven Xerox sales team in Cleveland.
All of these books went elsewhere in the end: Ms. Tartt's first novel went to Alfred A. Knopf for over $400,000; Mr. Arnett's was bought by Simon & Schuster for more than $600,000, and Mr. Dorsey's book went to Random House for the same price as Disney offered.
Do these failures suggest that the Disney name has an air of frivolity that tends to put serious writers off? Mr. Miller said that it was the Hyperion name that went on books and that he did not feel Disney's image was a problem. On the contrary, he suggested that authors were attracted by the security and stability that comes with being backed by the Walt Disney Company. "That works to our advantage," he said.
Still, he conceded that on "The Force," which was sold to Random House, the fact that Disney was new to adult trade publishing probably was a decisive factor. "When it comes to choosing between us and an editor like Joseph Fox at Random House," he said, "I feel that it will take us time to compete with that kind of prestige. But it is not a problem in many cases."
Among the books Disney has bought in highly competitive auctions is the next work by Dan Raviv and Yossi Melman, whose "Every Spy a Prince," a study of the Israeli secret service, was a best seller. The new book, "Friends in Deed," is a study of relations between the United States and Israel, and will be published in 1993.
Hyperion's fall list, its first, consists of nine books. Among them are "The Art of Mickey Mouse," "The Doors: The Complete Illustrated Lyrics," edited by Danny Sugarman, and a first novel called "The Cooter Farm," by Matthew Jones.
 
Fewer in Frankfurt
 Disney's impact has been that much greater because the largesse of publishing houses has dwindled somewhat this year because of the recession. In a reflection of this, major houses are cutting back on the traditionally very large delegations they dispatch to the Frankfurt Book Fair.
For many years, the Frankfurt fair, usually held in October, has been regarded as essential by any editor who wanted to wangle a trip to Germany. But the fact is that faxes have made international business very easy to conduct without leaving home.
This year, Bantam Doubleday Dell, which is owned by Bertelsmann , , the German publishing giant, is cutting its bandwagon by half, to about 15 people, said its president, Jack Hoeft. HarperCollins is cutting back to 25 people from 30, said Robert L. Biewen, a company vice president. And Alberto Vitale, the chief executive of Random House Inc., said the company was reducing its party by about 25 percent. He declined to say how many people were sent last year.
"Frankfurt had degenerated into a pilgrimage that was obligatory for all publishers," he said. "We should get back to the notion that it is fundamentally a rights fair."
At Frankfurt, in theory, international rights sales are made. But it also amounts to the publishing schmooze par excellence.

HEADLINE: Met Opera Is a Force in Recordings Again

BYLINE: By ALLAN KOZINN

 BODY:
After a hiatus of more than three decades, the Metropolitan Opera is not only recording regularly again, but it is also at the center of a battle between two rival record companies, Deutsche Grammophon and Sony Classical, with others waiting in the wings. 
 The reasons for the labels' new activity here are partly economic, with currency fluctuations and changes in union rules helping to make the Met more competitive with foreign orchestras. Spokesmen for the companies say, however, that the main attractions are James Levine and the Met orchestra itself, which under his direction has come to be regarded in recent years as one of the best in the world.
For the last month, the Met's musicians have been camped out at Manhattan Center on West 34th Street, in a ballroom that has been converted into a recording studio. Along with a parade of singers including, at different times, Luciano Pavarotti, Placido Domingo, Jessye Norman, Aprile Millo and Cheryl Studer, they have been recording bits and pieces of music, some only a few minutes long, some lasting half an hour.
Over the next few months, these bits will be stitched together into four operas: Verdi's "Traviata" and Wagner's "Parsifal," for Deutsche Grammophon, and Verdi's "Luisa Miller" and "Il Trovatore," for Sony. The sessions also yielded the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra's first symphonic recording, a collection of Wagner overtures for Deutsche Grammophon.
 
A Record Here and There
 Until 1987, when Deutsche Grammophon began recording the Met's "Ring" cycle, the orchestra's visits to the studio were infrequent. The company made some records in the 1950's, and recorded an isolated "Carmen" in the early 1970's and the soundtrack to Franco Zeffirelli's "Traviata" film in 1983.
Because of the high rates set by the American Federation of Musicians, recording opera in the United States was at the time prohibitively expensive for most record companies. Typically, recordings were made in Europe with combinations that might include, for instance, a London orchestra, an American conductor and an international cast of singers.
 In the mid-1980's, the musicians' union approved a contract that allowed opera orchestras to record at rates about 20 percent lower than standard symphonic rates. Even with the new rates, says Olympia Gineri, Sony's head of production, it can cost as much as $900,000 to record a four-act opera in the United States, about 30 percent more than comparable projects in Europe. But both Sony and Deutsche Grammophon wanted to record with Mr. Levine, and New York was where Mr. Levine wanted to work.
"When you record an opera in London," the conductor said recently, "you have an excellent orchestra, but one that doesn't know the piece. You rehearse the 15 minutes you are going to record, and then you record it. After a while, I thought: This is the reason we have so many anonymous sounding recordings. However good the orchestra is, it's not the same as recording with an orchestra that you play opera with every day. So I decided that I was not going to record that way anymore, and I waited for a time when I could apply what I was doing in the opera house to what I wanted to record."
 
The Met Helps With the Costs
 The Met also offered some financial incentives at first. When Deutsche Grammophon recorded the Met's "Ring" cycle, the opera company contributed about 20 percent of the session costs. It also contributed to the cost of recording Mozart's "Nozze di Figaro" last year. But Joseph Volpe, the Met's general director, said that for the rest of its recordings, the Met has picked up only a few incidental expenses.
Miss Gineri of Sony said in a recent telephone interview that she doubted that her company could afford to record the Met indefinitely without subsidies. This year, in fact, Sony postponed its planned recording of the Met's "Flying Dutchman" because the sessions did not fit into the company's budget.
There is not much sympathy for Sony's budget problems at Deutsche Grammophon, which had an exclusive contract with the Met until Sony came along and persuaded the company to renegotiate its deals.
Sony struck up its relationship with the Met in 1989, and inaugurated it with a recently released "Aida" featuring Mr. Domingo and Miss Millo. For some at Deutsche Grammophon, Sony's signing of the Met was calculated and predatory. Sony's president is Gunther Breest, who until 1988 was head of Deutsche Grammophon. When he joined Sony, Mr. Breest moved the label's headquarters to Hamburg, where Deutsche Grammophon is based, and lured both Vladimir Horowitz and the Herbert von Karajan video archive away from his former label.
Miss Gineri bristles at the assertion that the Met is part of this rivalry. "Who would spend so much money just to hurt another company?" she asked. But Aman Pedersen, head of Deutsche Grammophon's artists and repertory department, said that Deutsche Grammophon had been shocked at first by Sony's move into what had been its territory.
 
'But Things Change'
 "We did feel a rivalry at the start," Mr. Pedersen said. "But things change in the record business. After many years of not recording much opera, CBS -- now Sony -- is doing some serious work again, and we have to accommodate ourselves to that. It also has to do with singers. Some singers are associated with us, and some are associated with Sony. If you look at it that way, it is really not so surprising."
Besides the Deutsche Grammophon and Sony recordings, the Met has recorded Schoenberg's "Erwartung" for Philips , and is discussing recordings with London Records .
But Mr. Levine said: "I'm very anxious that the quantity does not get out of hand. What I would like to see in the future is two or three carefully chosen operas, as well as whatever symphonic repertory we feel we ought to record."
The casts of the recordings are idealized, in the sense that an operagoer is unlikely to run into the same combinations of singers in a single night at the Met. The "Parsifal" recording, for example, features Mr. Domingo and Miss Norman, the Parsifal and Kundry from last season's production. But the recording's Gurnemanz (Kurt Moll) and Amfortas (James Morris) have not yet sung those roles at the Met, though they are scheduled to do so next season. The "Traviata" recording, similarly, features Miss Studer, who has not yet sung Violetta in the house, and Mr. Pavarotti, who has not sung Alfredo at the Met in recent seasons.
 
The Pieces of the Puzzle
 "The casts represent, in various combinations, people who sing a lot at the Met, either in those roles or in others, or singers who are part of the Met ensemble," the conductor said. "You choose singers for a recording, or for television, because you think they will give you the best result in that medium."
At the Met's sessions, as at opera recording sessions everywhere, pieces of an opera are recorded out of sequence, with several takes of each section. Between takes, Mr. Levine tells the performers what changes in detail he wants, and he repeats sections until he either gets what he is looking for, or senses that the performers are losing their freshness. Putting the pieces in order comes later.
"No, I have never found it disorienting to record an opera out of sequence," Mr. Levine said after a "Traviata" session that began with the Act II duet between Violetta and Germont, and ended with the Act I Prelude. "In fact, you can turn to your advantage the fact that you are not recording the work as a straight-through performance.
"Let's say you're recording the third act of 'Walkure.' Wotan has a scene with the Valkyries, and with Brunnhilde and the Valkyries. Then the Valkyries go away, and he has a scene with Brunnhilde, ending with his big Abschied, or farewell. Every Wotan will tell you: unless he is having a magical day, to sing with full vehemence, anger, pressure and intensity during the first half of the act jeopardizes whether the sound will be as glowing and beautiful as it must be at the end.
"So when you record it, you record the first part of the act one day and the end at another session. The result is that he doesn't have to pace himself through one long take, and can give you his best in both. And that's important, because you are not seeing him. On a recording, it must all be there in the sound."

Where to Find Ware
Many cities have well-stocked stores for well-priced cooking equipment. But where such shops are not conveniently situated, there are new mail-order sources for equipment at a discount. 
 Commercial Culinary , based in Alexandria, Va., is a new venture run by Dave Constantine, who also has another catalogue, Spectacular Sauces. It offers cookware, knives and appliances like food processors, ice-cream makers and espresso makers. Prices run 20 percent to 40 percent below standard list. For example, the heavy duty KSM5 Kitchenaid mixer is $289.95 and the hand mixer $54.95. The Gaggia ice-cream maker is $379.95. Shipping is extra. For more information, call (800) 999-4949.
Also of interest to cooks is European Home Products , a company with a retail shop at 236 East Avenue, Norwalk, Conn., that specializes in replacement parts for appliances made by Cuisinarts, Robot-Coupe and Kitchenaid. The company even has an inventory of blades, bowls and the like for older models, some of which are no longer being made.
Accessories for these appliances are available, as are new appliances, at a discount, many of them at prices comparable to Commercial Culinary's. The company also has replacement carafes for many brands of electric coffee makers. Orders can be placed by calling (800) 225-0760 or, in Connecticut, (203) 866-9683.
 
Ice Cream's Still Cool
It's no surprise that ice cream is the most popular frozen dessert in this country. In a nationwide telephone survey conducted last summer by Dr. Robert O. Herrmann, professor of agricultural economics at Pennsylvania State University in University Park, 53 percent of 1,200 respondents said they had eaten ice cream in the previous four weeks, but 30 percent said that in the preceding year, they ate less ice cream than in the year before that.
Forty-four percent said they had eaten frozen yogurt in the preceding four weeks; 40 percent reported an increase in their consumption of frozen yogurt over the last year, and 38 percent said they had switched from ice cream to frozen yogurt.
The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. Dr. Herrmann plans a follow-up survey this summer.
 
Real and Hand-Packed
Rich, old-fashioned milk, heavy cream and now, ice cream, are the specialties of Glensfoot Farm in Cherry Valley, N.Y., a farm that dates to the 18th century. A few retail shops in Manhattan carry its products. The cream is not ultrapasteurized, which gives it a fresh rather than slightly cooked taste. It whips up splendidly and can be reduced easily to thicken a sauce.
The hand-packed ice cream is not as dense as some popular premium ice creams and has a smooth creaminess typical of an old-fashioned farmhouse confection. The flavors are clean, without the extra richness found in a custard-based French ice cream.
The ice cream comes in a lush vanilla, bittersweet chocolate, mellow coffee, fragrant strawberry and rich pralines and cream.
The addition of vegetable gums like guar and carageenan, to keep the texture smooth and improve shelf life, differentiate these ice creams from what one might lick off the dasher of a home ice-cream machine.
The heavy cream is $1.75 a half pint and the ice cream is $3.25 a pint at Balducci's, 424 Avenue of the Americas (Ninth Street), $1.89 for the cream and $3.98 for the ice cream at Dean & DeLuca, 560 Broadway (Prince Street), and $1.65 for the cream and $3.49 for the ice cream at Grace's Marketplace, 1237 Third Avenue (71st Street). Jefferson Market, 455 Avenue of the Americas (10th Street) offers the cream for $1.49 a half pint.
 
For Miss Liberty
"Star-Spangled Cooking" (1987), about American regional food, and "A Taste of Liberty" (1985), a survey of ethnic food in America, are two illustrated cookbooks published by Stewart Tabori & Chang . They were produced by Chateau Ste. Michelle, a winery in Washington State, as a project to raise money to support the restoration of the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. The books, which also promote the winery, are now being sold there and are available by mail.
Now, Chateau Ste. Michelle has announced that it is contributing $10 of the price of every book sold to the American Red Cross.
The books are $24.95 each plus $2.50 for shipping, or $44.95 plus $4 for shipping for both. The offer continues through the end of the year.
Orders can be placed by sending checks or credit card information to Chateau Ste. Michelle Winery, Commemorative Cookbooks Center, Department P, 1 Stimson Lane, Woodinville, Wash., 98072.
 
BIG-CITY STRAWBERRIES
IN farm country, strawberry festivals belong to early summer. But there will be a big-city version next Wednesday, complete with shortcake, at the City Bakery, 22 East 17th Street, from 6:30 to 9 P.M.
Fresh strawberries, strawberry desserts and even a strawberry soup made from produce sold at the Union Square Greenmarket nearby will be served with Hudson Valley wines. It's a benefit for Farm Hands City Hands, a nonprofit organization that seeks to preserve farms and foster understanding between urban and rural interests.
Tickets to the strawberry festival are $20 and are on sale at the City Bakery, at the Breezy Hill Orchards stand in the Greenmarket today and Saturday, and at Foodwork, 34 Downing Street (Seventh Avenue South). They will also be sold at the door.
For information, call (212) 255-1780.

HEADLINE: Help Families Choose, Everywhere

 BODY:
Thirty years ago, barely a tenth of the people in developing countries used some kind of birth control. Today more than half do -- in large part because of America's pioneering efforts to help people choose the size of their families. That choice is important not only for individuals but for countries, some of which are so devastated and deforested they cannot feed and house their own.
Seven years ago, at the 1984 World Population Conference in Mexico City, the United States trashed its position as a wise world leader on this issue. It announced it would try to end financial aid to any agency that so much as mentioned abortion. The Agency for International Development, aided and abetted by Congress, then withdrew financing from the United Nations Fund for Population Activities and the International Planned Parenthood Federation. 
 That Congress can put such strictures on its financing is supported by a recent Supreme Court decision. Whether it should, however, is a matter of conscience -- and evidence is mounting that Congressional consciences are troubled.
Last week, for instance, the House Appropriations Committee approved a foreign aid bill that would overturn the ban on American support for United Nations population planning programs. The bill would increase population planning funds by 20 percent (up to $300 million), but earmarks $20 million for the U.N. program. Furthermore, the full House now backs language authorizing the $20 million, and on a roll call vote narrowly supported reversing the Mexico City policy.
A comparable initiative is under way in the Senate, where proposed legislation contains a proposal from Senator Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas to reverse the Mexico City policy. Last week the bill survived an assault by Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, by a vote of 13 to 6.
For years, Americans could be genuinely proud of this country's commitment to international family planning. Congress, if it continues down the present path, seems willing to restore the basis for that pride. And so, by overturning the Mexico City policy, could President Bush.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Asserts the Recession May Be at an End, or Nearly So

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 18

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said today that the recession might already have ended but that no measurable expansion of the nation's economy had yet begun.
"Clearly we have data which are subject to revision and are likely to be revised one way or the other," Mr. Greenspan told the House Ways and Means Committee. "But it's very difficult to get around the data of the last several weeks, which are strongly suggestive that the bottom is somewhere in the second quarter." 
 The financial markets interpreted Mr. Greenspan's statement as an indication that the Federal Reserve is unlikely to reduce interest rates even though inflation seems well under control, and stock and bond prices fell slightly today.
Mr. Greenspan's remarks were the first in which the nation's principal economic policy maker has said publicly that the recession might be over. A similar consensus has emerged among private economists in the last two weeks.
In his testimony, Mr. Greenspan made these other comments about the economy:
*Banks continue to be reluctant to lend, and credit is still tight.
*The commercial real estate market remains in a slump and is not likely to recover as quickly as the rest of the economy does.
*Foreign trade barriers do not significantly depress American exports, while United States trade barriers cost American consumers tens of billions of dollars a year.
 
Optimism About Inflation
 In response to a question from Representative Thomas J. Downey, Democrat of Long Island, Mr. Greenspan said he was "confident that we can come out of this with a recovery without concurrently reigniting inflationary forces, which inevitably, within a reasonably short period, create the next recession."
But he added that "we don't yet see any measurable upward thrust" in the nation's output of goods and services. And in response to further questions, Mr. Greenspan refused to say how long a recovery might last or how strong it might be.
In testimony two weeks ago, however, Mr. Greenspan said the recovery might be stronger than expected.
At a separate hearing by the Senate Finance Committee on the nomination of David W. Mullins Jr. to become vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, Mr. Mullins said the economy had touched bottom in the last month or so, or was about to do so. Edward Kelley, a Federal Reserve governor, told the Senate Banking Committee last week that the economy appeared to have bottomed out.
Congressional pressure for lower rates notwithstanding, Mr. Mullins said, "it's not apparent that there is room" for the central bank to ease monetary policy soon without raising fears of inflation that could drive up rates on longer-term bonds. An increase in interest rates on long-term bonds might defeat the purpose of stimulating the economy by easing monetary policy, Mr. Mullins said.
By pumping more money into the nation's banking system, the Federal Reserve can drive down short-term rates, making it cheaper for stores to hold large inventories and for consumers to take out home equity loans.
But such a move tends to drive up long-term rates, as lenders become concerned that inflation will seriously devalue the money they are to be repaid. Long-term rates tend to affect purchases of homes and other large investments.
Mr. Mullins said any gain to the economy from driving down short-term rates now would probably be offset by the loss from higher long-term rates.
Mr. Greenspan said banks continue to be cautious in their lending practices, as they try to build up capital in case many of their nonperforming loans must be written off entirely. As a result, he said, "We are still in the grips of a credit crunch."
Many of the banking industry's problem loans have financed commercial real estate. Mr. Greenspan said this sector of the economy would "lag quite considerably" in its recovery from the recession.
"It shows very few signs that I can see that it is in the process of stabilizing; there's some, but not a great deal," he said. "But surely there is no evidence at this point which suggests that it is improving or about to."
But an upturn in the number of Americans employed is likely a few months after a rebound in the nation's total output of goods and services, Mr. Greenspan said.
Few questions to Mr. Greenspan from members of the House Ways and Means Committee dealt with the original subject of the hearing, the competitiveness of the United States in international markets.
In his opening remarks, Mr. Greenspan strongly endorsed the Administration's position of eliminating trade barriers and holding down Government intervention in the market. There have been plausible estimates that "the unilateral removal of quantitative restrictions on imports of textiles, apparel and various agricultural products would result in net gains to U.S. consumers amounting to tens of billions of dollars," he said.
"Moreover," he added, "the complete removal of existing foreign restrictions on U.S. exports probably would reduce our trade deficit by only modest amounts."
Mr. Greenspan said the Federal Government should not provide subsidies to specific industries even if they appear especially likely to succeed. If the industries have genuinely good prospects, then the private sector will finance them, he said.
But the chairman of the Federal Reserve has no legal authority over these issues, and many in Congress already have firm views about them.

HEADLINE: Noted Japanese Retailer Plans Ritz Tower Store

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
Mitsukoshi, Japan's oldest and one of its more prestigious department stores, plans to open its doors in the spring of 1993 in the Ritz Tower Hotel at 57th Street and Park Avenue, in one of the world's most fashionable retail districts.
To succeed in the heart of New York's highly competitive but financially beleaguered retail market, Mitsukoshi officials said, the store will have to emphasize Japanese retail principles, which are based on the premise that customers should shop in an entertaining and enlightening atmosphere. 
 On the the top floor of the store's four levels, for example, will be a gallery where the company plans to stage poetry readings, art shows and musical and dramatic events.
The 40,000-square-foot store, organized around an atrium, will offer a mix of designer and private-label clothing, unusual gifts and Japanese arts and crafts.
Mitsukoshi said it would tailor its merchandise to appeal to the same customers that shop at Saks Fifth Avenue, Henri Bendel and Galeries Lafayette. Plans call for a basement stocked with fresh and prepared foods ranging from the most ordinary vegetables to delicacies like Japanese Kobe beef.
"The time the customer spends in Mitsukoshi is very important, so we will have a full range of services, products and entertainment to keep her occupied," said Tomio Tambe, president of Mitsukoshi U.S.A. "The idea," he said, "is to enjoy the surroundings and the experience."
Mitsukoshi has stores in London, Paris and Rome, among other cities, and 14 stores in Japan, where its distinctive logo is regarded as a sign of good taste and quality, said John Wheeler, vice president of the Japan Society, a New York group that promotes Japanese culture in America.
The company also has a small shop selling Japanese arts and crafts at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla.
Company officials conceded that the New York retail climate was difficult, particularly for lavish stores aimed at an affluent clientele. But they said the opportunity to own commercial space in the Ritz Tower, the 1925 landmark building designed by Emery Roth, was too good to pass up. They also said they expected the economy to recover by the time the store opened.
Japanese retailers have had difficulty operating in the American market in the past because they have tried to imitate American stores' products and services instead of distinguishing themselves, said Elizabeth Miller Kummerfeld of Kummerfeld Associates, a management and venture-capital consulting firm in New York.
 
'They Have Deep Pockets'
 "I would say it's going to be tough going for them, but Mitsukoshi is among the most prestigious department stores in Japan," Ms. Kummerfeld said. "They have deep pockets and a long-term perspective on business."
Ms. Kummerfeld, who has advised other Japanese companies entering the American market, said Mitsukoshi would have to invest heavily in advertising to establish its name and bring in merchandise that would distinguish it from competitors.
Although customers will not be required to exchange their shoes for cotton socks, a practice that lasted well into the 20th century in Japanese stores, the company intends to bring many of its other Japanese customs to its Manhattan store. Customers will be greeted at the entrances to the store by bowing sales clerks, and consultants will be on hand to offer opinions and suggestions and guide shoppers to various parts of the store.
The company says it will contain many of its costs by selling items made in factories it owns or supervises. Mitsukoshi supervisers, for example, work in the Chinese factories that make embroidered blouses Mitsukoshi sells in its stores. "There are no middlemen," Mr. Tambe said. "We control the costs and the quality."
 
Came to New York 15 Years Ago
 Mitsukoshi opened an office in New York in 1976 and soon began operating a Japanese restaurant and a boutique that sold clothes made by the Japanese designer Matsuda. Both businesses are in a 10,000-square-foot space that it formerly leased from the Ritz Tower.
Mitsukoshi has now bought that space and an additional 30,000 square feet for $17.25 million. The boutique and restaurant have been closed while the company completes renovations.
In the fiscal year that ended Feb. 28, 1990, the last year for which financial statistics are available, the company had sales of $5.6 billion and a profit margin of less than 1 percent, which is slender by American standards. The stock trades on the Tokyo Exchange.
 
A 318-Year History
 Among the reasons Mr. Tambe gave for his confidence in the store's success was the company's 318-year-old history. Its predecessor was Echigo-ya (pronounced EE-chi-GO-ya), a dry-goods store founded in what is now Tokyo in 1673 by Takatoshi Mitsui.
Profits from Echigo-ya contributed to the the Mitsui family fortune and the vast Mitsui empire in Japan.The retail stores that were descendants of Echigo-ya adopted the name Mitsukoshi Ltd. in 1928.
"We've been in this business since 1673," Mr. Tambe said. "We move very slowly, but we make sure everything is workable."

HEADLINE: Volcano's Ash Dismays Filipinos and Americans

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OLONGAPO, the Philippines, June 19

 BODY:
On both sides of the heavy steel gate that separates this city from Subic Bay Naval Station, the sprawling American naval base, there was a shared sense of hopelessness today.
Five days after Mount Pinatubo covered much of this coastal region with layer upon layer of volcanic ash and sand, which has been turned into a quagmire by the constant rains, the situation had only worsened. 
 There was only intermittent electricity today, little running water and a sense of concern about the future.
There is talk by officials here and in Washington that the cleanup costs from the volcano, 35 miles northwest of Subic, may be so great and the future of the base so precarious that the United States may have to make some hard decisions on whether to keep Subic and the American-run Clark Air Base. The joint lease on the bases runs out in September, and talks had been suspended because the Filipinos had rejected an American offer as too low. Now, many Filipinos wish the lease had been signed.
 
'How Will We Make Money?'
 Here, in Olongapo, a typical city that depends on a military base to survive, many Filipinos strolling past the honky-tonk saloons along Magsaysay Drive this afternoon said the closing of Subic Bay would be an economic calamity.
"Maybe the Americans won't come back because of the volcano," said a 21-year-old e bar hostess, who gave her name only as Miki. "The Americans always talk about how they might have to leave Subic and go home forever."
"But how will we make money if they go?" she said.
Because of the volcano the bar was virtually empty of customers.
 
A Yearlong Cleanup
 "In some ways, life might be good -- better -- without the Americans," she continued. "But how will we survive?"
Frankie Dana, a 27-year-old T-shirt salesman born in Olongapo, was hawking shirts stenciled with the words, "I Survived Mount Pinatubo."
"My only buyers are Americans," he said, frantically trying to cover the shirts with a plastic sheet to protect them from a rainy season downpour. "Americans are all we have."
The cleanup of Subic base, one of the largest American military installations outside the United States and a cornerstone of American security policy in Asia since World War II, will take months, if not a year or more, officials at the base say.
Thick layers of ash emitted by Mount Pinatubo cover virtually every inch of the 100,000-acre installation.
Soaked by rain, the ash, which has the appearance of caked, dirty snow and the consistency of wet charcoal, is jamming electrical generators and has contaminated much of the fresh water supply in Olongapo and at Subic. Scores of buildings at the naval base have collapsed from the ash's weight.
"We got some running water today," said Petty Officer Jerry Moore, a base spokesman. "We were glad to see it, even if it's only for drinking. We still don't smell very good."
Although volcano scientists say the major eruptions of Mount Pinatubo appear to be over, the Defense Department is pressing forward with the evacuation of nearly 20,000 Americans from the Philippines, including the families of all military and civilian workers at Subic and Clark.
 
Families Shipping Out
 Hundreds of the families waited in line this afternoon outside a bowling alley at Subic that was serving as an evacuation center.
"I absolutely understand why the Navy is doing this, but it's still been tears all round for my family," said Petty Officer First Class Patrick Dunn, 34, of Kansas City, Mo., who had come to the evacuation center to see his Filipino wife, Eva, and their three children depart.
"You can't keep families here when there are no showers and no electricity," he said. "I've never seen anything like this. This ash is everywhere and I don't know how you clean it up."
Anne Comer, the wife of a Navy lieutenant assigned to Subic, held tight to 1-year-old Kathryn, the youngest of her five children.
 
Clouds of Volcanic Ash
 "We're supposed to be shipping out tonight and I have to leave my husband behind," said Mrs. Comer, 39, who looked weary from five days of ash storms and earthquakes brought on by the volcano.
"Basically I've had no sleep since this began," she said. "The stress level is very, very high for everyone."
Air traffic has been shut down throughout the central Philippines for several days out of fear that the swirling clouds of volcanic ash might cause jet engines to stall.
The international and domestic airports in Manila, about 65 miles southeast of Subic Bay, have been closed to most flights for five days.
That has required the Defense Department to evacuate the Americans by sea, aboard warships that have been put on a shuttle run this week between Subic and the Philippine city of Cebu, about 300 miles south of the base, where the international airport has not been affected by the ash.
A city that grew up out of the Subic base to service the United States Navy and to entertain generations of American sailors, Olongapo and its 300,000 residents are nothing if not resilient.
Several of the city's best-known places, with names like "The Body Shop" and "Love Disco" were shut down or destroyed by the volcano.
But others have struggled to remain open despite the loss of electrical power and the six-foot-high mounds of volcanic ash and sand clogging the street.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Closes Mostly Lower In Advance of London Talks

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar ended broadly lower yesterday, pushed down by technical factors, economic concerns and fears that world leaders might try to stem the currency's recent rally.
Gold was slightly higher in New York after falling overseas. 
 Dollar sales continued on speculation that this Sunday's meeting in London of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations might result in a concerted effort to keep the value of the dollar down.
In the past, the group has used central bank interventions and interest rates to try to influence the dollar's movement. Some dealers said the Group of Seven officials were unlikely to reach an accord, but investors were not prepared to run that risk.
"We saw a lot of people taking profit on long positions. A few of the longer-term currency funds seemed to be sellers of the dollar," said Bob Morrissey, senior currency trader for the Bank of Boston.
 
Trade Report
 Traders read a mixed message into a Commerce Department report that the United States merchandise trade deficit swelled to $4.78 billion in April, reversing a two-month decline that had put it at the lowest level in eight years.
Some traders said the deficit's widening had hurt the dollar, despite exports totaling $35.56 billion, a 4.5 percent increase from March.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.6325, from $1.6120 late on Tuesday. Sterling also strengthened in New York, rising to $1.6363, from late Tuesday's $1.6103.
Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.04 yen to close at 141.10 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted at a lower rate of 140.03 yen. In New York, the dollar closed at 140.05 yen, down from late Tuesday's 141.08.
Other late dollar rates in New York yesterday, compared with late Tuesday, included: 1.7895 German marks, down from 1.8164; 1.5385 Swiss francs, down from 1.5645; 6.0870 French francs, down from 6.1725; 1,334.00 Italian lire, down from 1,351.00, and 1.14325 Canadian dollars, up from 1.14225.
Gold edged up in New York trading, gaining 30 cents an ounce on the Commodity Exchange to close at $368.60. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $368.15 an ounce, up 40 cents from late on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: FEUD UNDERMINING BRITISH TORY UNITY

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, June 19

 BODY:
Since succeeding Margaret Thatcher as Prime Minister in November, John Major has been trying to defuse the two issues that had split Britain's ruling Conservative Party and forced Mrs. Thatcher out of office: a highly unpopular new household tax and Britain's position in the debate on moving the European Community toward political and economic integration.
Mr. Major solved the first issue in April by moving to replace Mrs. Thatcher's tax with a property tax. He thought he was well on the way to resolving the European issue until this week, when the two Conservative Prime Ministers who preceded him, Mrs. Thatcher and Edward Heath, spoke their piece. 
 In speeches in the United States on Monday and Tuesday, Mrs. Thatcher delivered a stinging attack on any attempts to carry European integration beyond the single market that the community envisions by the end of 1992. She argued that a federal Europe would not only deprive Britain of national sovereignty and undermine democracy, but might also bring trade wars, imperil Britain's military alliance with the United States and threaten world peace.
Mrs. Thatcher also said that she regretted Britain's linkup with the exchange-rate mechanism of the European Monetary System, which ties the value of the pound to those of other major European currencies, especially the German mark.
 
Heath Takes Aim at Thatcher
 If those speeches were not enough to make Mr. Major groan, Mr. Heath assailed Mrs. Thatcher's views in television interviews Tuesday night. Mrs. Thatcher ousted Mr. Heath as party leader in 1975, two years after he took Britain into the community as Prime Minister, and Britons are aware that no love is lost between them.
Mr. Heath said Mrs. Thatcher's two speeches were "full of falsehoods -- in ordinary English, lies," and he called her "ignorant" for not realizing that "we have a European culture as well as individual national aspects." Responding to Mrs. Thatcher's description of proponents of a federal Europe as "little Europeans," he said: "The little mind is her own -- minute."
Unlike Mrs. Thatcher, Mr. Major has tried to take a constructive role in talks with other community members on closer economic and political union. He is desperate to forge a compromise on Europe among Conservatives so he can present a united front to British voters. The law requires the Government to call a general election within a year.

HEADLINE: GORBACHEV'S LOT: THE ENEMY WITHIN

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, June 19

 BODY:
As President Mikhail S. Gorbachev seeks to build new bridges to the West and to the Soviet Union's assertive republics, a rebellion is shaping from a new direction: his Prime Minister.
At the current session of the Soviet Parliament this week, the Prime Minister, Valentin S. Pavlov, surprised legislators by requesting extensive new powers and acknowledging that he had not discussed the matter in advance with Mr. Gorbachev. 
 Mr. Pavlov made the request on Monday after casting aspersions on an unofficial plan devised by a liberal economist, Grigory A. Yavlinsky, and a group of Harvard professors to integrate Soviet economic reforms with Western aid. The Prime Minister dismissed the plan as "a pretty piece of paper."
Mr. Pavlov insisted that the powers he was seeking would not release the Government from the President's and Parliament's supervision, but would "increase its mobility and effectiveness." Specifically, he asked that Parliament give his Government the authority for the rest of this year to enact laws and take temporary action on economic and social issues.
Mr. Gorbachev was not at the session, but his Vice President, Gennadi I. Yanayev, quickly declared that the President did not see any political challenge.
 
Showdown Deferred
 Still, it was evident that a rift had developed between the conservative Prime Minister, a career bureaucrat whom Mr. Gorbachev put in charge of the Government in January, and the Soviet President.
Mr. Gorbachev's allies managed to sidetrack Mr. Pavlov's proposal until Friday, sending it to a committee.
But it prompted some startled comments in the press, including this one in Izvestia: "A situation has taken shape that is simply unprecedented for our country. For the first time in the history of the Soviet Union, the head of the Government not only expressed disagreement with some policies of the head of state, officially, from the parliamentary tribunal, but -- circumventing the head of state, the President -- tried to take some of the President's powers."
Mr. Pavlov and other Communist hard-liners have felt themselves increasingly sidelined since Mr. Gorbachev struck a political truce with Boris N. Yeltsin and leaders of eight other Soviet republics on April 23.
That truce has led to negotiations on a new union treaty with sharply reduced powers for the Kremlin. Mr. Gorbachev has also opened a new dialogue with the West, and has supported the initiative by Mr. Yavlinsky, the primary architect of the 500-day program of radical economic reform that Mr. Gorbachev rejected last fall.
Mr. Pavlov seems especially miffed at having been sidelined in the Gorbachev initiative to the West. In his appearance before Parliament on Monday, he spoke of the initiative in dismissive and scornful terms.
 
A True Disbeliever
 "I can say only one thing: If suddenly, for some reason, the Americans agree to freely help us, I will apologize and confess that I was deeply wrong," he said. "But I do not believe in this, neither as a professional nor as a normal person."
Hard-liners in Parliament adopted Mr. Pavlov's tone, unleashing a round of bitter attacks on Mr. Gorbachev.
Yevgeny Kogan, a leader of the Soyuz group, who has called for Mr. Gorbachev's ouster, declared in an interview that the President's negotiations on a new union treaty and his dealings with the West were "a plot by the country's top bureaucrats against the people's power."
But newspapers and legislators advocating democracy rose up against Mr. Pavlov. Sergei Ryabchenko, a reformist legislator, told the press agency Tass that the requested powers would allow the Prime Minister "to function without the President."
"As a result," he said, "the President would remain in a vacuum while the Cabinet would turn into a new center of political and econmic power."
 
Conjunction of Hard-Liners
 Contributing to the rebellious mood were reportedly alarmist reports on the state of the nation by the hard-line chiefs of the K.G.B., the military and the Interior Ministry. The Parliament session was closed to the press for their appearances, but subsequent comments by lawmakers suggested a dissatisfaction with the new direction of Mr. Gorbachev.
The challenge was not likely to pose an immediate problem for Mr. Gorbachev, who has sidetracked previous attacks from hard-liners with relative ease. But the combined power of his critics was sufficient to give him pause.
Events of recent months, including ill-conceived monetary reforms that Mr. Pavlov introduced and the violent confrontations in Lithuania and Latvia, have demonstrated the capacity of the hard-liners to wreak havoc.
Mr. Gorbachev's position toward them has not yet become clear. After rejecting the 500-day economic plan last fall, he moved toward the political right, prompting Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze to resign in December, warning against an incipient dictatorship.
But after the violence in the Baltic republics, a loss of favor in the West and intensifying chaos at home, Mr. Gorbachev struck a truce with democracy advocates and apparently began edging away from the hard-liners. So far, though, he has stopped short of fully restoring his ties to former liberal aides, or of breaking with the hard-liners.

HEADLINE: Gallic Dart Distresses British Men

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, June 19

 BODY:
The weather in London and Paris has been awful for weeks, but the summer silly season has thankfully arrived on schedule, this time adding a tiff over the relative virility of English and French men to the old perennial of cross-Channel squabbling.
The first shot was fired by Edith Cresson, the first woman to become Prime Minister of France, who was quoted on Sunday as having said that 25 percent of Englishmen -- as well as Americans and Germans -- are homosexual and that, in contrast to Frenchmen, "Anglo-Saxon men are not interested in women." 
 The interview, published in The Observer of London under the headline, "France's femme fatale," was in fact four years old and Mrs. Cresson says she cannot remember giving it. But while Americans and Germans ignored it, England's brave men do not take Gallic taunts lightly -- even when coming from a woman.
A Conservative member of Parliament, Tony Marlow, suggested that the 57-year-old Prime Minister had only herself to blame if "the last time she was in London she did not get enough admiring glances." And he suggested a motion: "This House does not fancy elderly Frenchwomen."
The popular daily The Sun said it was "a bit rich" for English manhood to be questioned by the leader of a country "where men carry handbags and kiss each other on the cheek in public." The Daily Telegraph said it prefered not to ask how Mrs. Cresson had come up with her statistics.
 
newspaper Cartoon
 In The Evening Standard, a cartoon by Jak has an aide to Mrs. Cresson announcing the arrival of the British Ambassador with "a very strong complaint." Wearing an Ascot hat and a flowery dress, His Excellency can be seen waving a newspaper with the headline, "One in Four Brits are Gay."
In France, though, Mrs. Cresson's interview stirred amusement but no criticism. After all, Swinging Edith -- as Le Canard Enchaine nicknamed her -- was only saying what most French have always felt about many Englishmen. "Too many years in all-male boarding schools," one Frenchwoman explained.
The fuss is nonetheless doubly embarrassing for the Prime Minister because it has coincided with a wave of complaints from Japan that she has gone overboard in her criticism of Japan's export policies. With Japanese far-rightists organizing protests outside France's embassy in Tokyo, the latest remark attributed to her is that the Japanese are too busy plotting against the American and European economies to be able to sleep at night.
With the English, at least, she has felt a need to defend herself, noting on Tuesday that it was not "fair play" to publish an old interview and that she loves England, speaks English and enjoys visiting London. But she added: "Englishmen are surely more reserved toward women than Frenchmen but, in the end, each country has its own traditions and culture."
In reality, what grabbed the headlines in her interview in The Observer was her response to the suggestion that in Anglo-Saxon countries men prefer the company of other men. "Yes," she said, "but the majority of these men are homosexual -- perhaps not the majority -- but in the U.S.A. there are already 25 percent of them and in England and Germany it is much the same."
Yet, in a sense, the thrust of her remarks was different -- that Anglo-Saxon men fail to appreciate women because there is something culturally or biologically wrong with them.
 "I remember from strolling about in London that men in the streets don't look at you," she said. "When you do this in Paris, men look at you."
She went on: "Anglo-Saxons are not interested in women as women. For a woman arriving in an Anglo-Saxon country, it is astonishing. She says to herself, 'What is the matter?' It is a problem of education and I consider it something of a weakness. A man who isn't interested in women is in some way a little maimed."
More disturbing to Englishmen is that some Englishwomen agree. "In an English street, you might as well have a paper bag over your head for all the notice any man takes of you," wrote Lesley Garner in The Daily Telegraph, adding that Mrs. Cresson had given a "hurtful, shocking and uncomfortably accurate view" of British men.
In The Daily Mirror, the columnist Marje was gentler with the menfolk, but added: "Keep your heads up, lads, and take a keener and closer look at the passing talent. Somehow we've got to keep on breeding good, strong silent Britons -- and it can't be done without your cooperation."

HEADLINE: Survey by the Fed Sees Modest Recovery Signs

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 19

 BODY:
The economy has begun showing modest signs of recovery, although weaknesses remain in some regions and in some industries, the Federal Reserve said today.
"Economic conditions appear to be improving modestly in much of the nation," it said in a summary of its latest survey of the economy's state. 
 The White House agreed. "We are coming out of the recession," the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said.
And Michael J. Boskin, the White House's chief economic adviser, told Congress that the economy would resume growing during the second half of the year at an annual rate of up to 3 percent.
 
Inflation Seems in Check
 The Fed survey found retail sales up moderately in some of the central bank's 12 districts, with manufacturing gaining strength in some of the regions and home sales continuing to recover.
At the same time, the survey reported that inflation appeared to be in check, with prices "generally steady to up slightly at both the wholesale and retail levels."
But it noted a downside, saying that "stable oil prices and low natural gas prices are keeping oil drilling in check."
The survey, compiled from information supplied by the Fed banks earlier this month, was prepared for top Fed officials to use at their meeting July 2 and 3 to map interest-rate policy. The Fed's district banks get their information by questioning business people in their areas. There has been no noticeable change in interest-rate policy since the central bank lowered two key interest rates on April 30 as a stimulus "in light of continued weakness in economic activity."
 
No Changes Indicated
 The Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, and a Fed governor, David W. Mullins Jr., indicated on Tuesday that no change was imminent as policy makers were waiting to see what direction the economy took.
While Mr. Greenspan said the economy appeared to have bottomed out "somewhere in the second quarter," he added, "We see no measurable upward thrust," a view that appeared somewhat at odds with the findings of the Fed's "beige book."
The Fed has been hesitant to nudge interest rates down further out of fear the move could stimulate the economy too much and inflame inflation.
Nevertheless, the White House spokesman, Mr. Fitzwater, appeared to urge the Fed to ease monetary policy more when he expressed concern over the pace of economic growth.
"We are interested in maintaining a good pace of growth as we come out of it so that we can achieve a very strong plateau of growth in the years ahead," he said.
Mr. Boskin told the House Ways and Means Committee that the Administration was continuing to forecast growth in the second half at a yearly rate of 2 percent to 3 percent.
The rebound, he suggested, "will be rather modest" because the recession itself has been shallow.
First-year growth after previous post-World War II recoveries has averaged about 6 percent.
In its survey, the Fed found retail sales varying according to district. Some described gains as slight or moderate, while others reported lackluster activity.
"While there are no reports of substantial improvement, the overall situation is somewhat brighter" than it was during a previous survey in early spring, the report said. "Manufacturing activity seems to be improving over all, but several districts report slower export growth."
 
Increased Construction
 The continuing improvement in home sales is being translated into increased construction activity in some areas, it added.
But it said bank lending remained weak in the eight districts reporting on financial developments, despite a pickup in demand for home mortgage loans. Much of the mortgage activity related to refinancing rather than new purchases.
Demand for business and consumer loans was weak in most regions.
The report also noted that extreme weather conditions in several districts had hampered spring planting and were expected to pare production. Depending on the district, the crops affected included wheat, corn, soybeans, cotton, peanuts, rice and grain sorghum.

HEADLINE: Trade Gap Widened In April

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 19

 BODY:
The nation's deficit in merchandise trade widened to $4.8 billion in April as both exports and imports posted sizable and somewhat unexpected increases, the Commerce Department reported today.
Although trade figures are relatively poor gauges of overall economic conditions, partly because they are reported later than most other indicators, analysts said today's results were consistent with the increasingly popular view that the economy has begun to pull out of recession. 
 "It augurs well," said Nancy Sidhu, an economist at Security Pacific National Bank. "It gives me a little more confidence" that exports will help drive the recovery and that demand for imports has rebounded following the Persian Gulf war.
 
Reversal in the Trend
 The moderate widening followed two months of sharp narrowing that had reduced the deficit to just over $4 billion, the lowest since mid-1983 and less than half the level a year earlier.
Robert A. Mosbacher, the Commerce Secretary, issued a statement that foreign sales reached a record $35.6 billion in April and that for the first four months of the year had run at a pace 7 percent above comparable 1990 levels.
"Continued improvement in our export performance," he asserted, "will add impetus to the economic recovery in the months ahead." The April advance was $1.6 billion, or 4.5 percent higher than in March.
But some economists, including Harald B. Malmgren, a Washington consultant specializing in trade issues, expressed concern that exports had not been even more robust.
 
Improvement Slows Down
 "The rate of improvement of exports is slowing down," Mr. Malmgren said, contending this important engine of economic recovery as envisioned by the Bush Administration "already looks like it's running out of fuel" because of a slowdown in other countries and a rising dollar.
Imports rose an even sharper $2.2 billion, or 5.9 percent, but at $40.3 billion remained nearly 10 percent below the October 1990 peak. Recession significantly curbed demand for imported tools.
Economists also took encouragement from the broad-based nature of the export gain, which came at a time that the economies of several of the nation's main trade partners are slowing or are already mired in recession.
Exports of capital goods rose $900 million in April; automotive vehicles, parts and engines, $500 million; industrial supplies and materials, $300 million.
"There's stil a demand for U.S. products," said Bruce Steinberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch.
Declines of about $100 million were posted for exports of foods, feeds and beverages and other merchandise, with consumer goods about unchanged.
Among imports, industrial supplies and materials rose $900 million; capital goods and consumer goods each rose $500 million; foods, feeds and beverages rose $300 million, and automotive goods rose $100 million.
The nation's oil bill, meanwhile, climbed moderately to $4 billion, a level equal to 83 percent of the trade deficit. Higher volumes more than offset a 75-cent-a-barrel decline in the cost of crude.
The American trade deficit with Japan narrowed to $3.3 billion from $3.6 billion, the shrinkage equal to reduced imports of Japanese motor vehicles, the Commerce Department report also showed.
 
Wider Deficit With China
 But the deficit grew with China, a country with which the Bush Administration seeks to renew most-favored-nation trade status over the objection of many in Congress. The complaints involve Chinese labor practices as well as political repression.
The amount by which United Status purchases of Chinese goods exceeded American sales to China was $670 million, up from $500 million in March. So far this year the deficit totals $2.9 billion, compared with $2.5 billion in the first four months of 1990.
The American surplus with Western Europe shrank to $2.1 billion from $3.2 billion, and the surplus with the Soviet Union eased to $250 million from $385 million. The deficit with Canada eased about $100 million but the deficit with the newly indistrialized countries of the Far East nearly tripled to $765 million.
 
Advanced Technology Products
 In advanced-technology products, the surplus narrowed $300 million, to $3.4 billion, as exports fell off more than imports.
Before adjustment for weather and other seasonal factors, the overall April deficit was $3.7 billion, compared with $1.9 billion in March. When seasonally adjusted but with dollar values held constant, the April deficit widened to $4.3 billion from $3.3 billion.
By still another gauge, the seasonally adjusted current-dollar deficit when calculated on a three-month moving average improved for the fifth straight time at $4.8 billion, half the November peak.

Headquarters Change For General Dynamics

 BODY:
The General Dynamics Corporation said yesterday that it would shift its headquarters from St. Louis to the Washington area, a move that is likely to cost St. Louis more prestige than dollars.
The company, the nation's second-largest military contractor, said the decision made sense in light of the heightened competition among contractors as the Pentagon cuts costs. While no specific location has been determined, the company said it was considering sites in suburban Virginia and Maryland. 
 "With the end of the cold war and increasing pressure on the Federal budget, the defense industry of the future will be characterized by reduced Government spending and increased competition," said William A. Anders, the chairman. "Consequently, we believe that the company can operate more effectively by having our headquarters and our leadership closer to our principal customers and policy makers."
The change comes amid considerable strife for General Dynamics and for the miltary industry.
Last year, General Dynamics lost $578 million, or $13.86 a share, on revenues of $10.2 billion after taking a $700 million charge on the A-12 Avenger attack plane, which was canceled by the Navy.
The move, to be completed by the fall, will affect a small number of the company's 90,000 employees. About 275 people work in the St. Louis headquarters, with only 115 to be transferred. Thirty people will stay in St. Louis, General Dynamics said, and the rest are being encouraged to remain during the transition.
The McDonnell Douglas Corporation, the nation's largest military contractor, is also based in St. Louis but is unlikely to follow General Dynamics. McDonnell Douglas has its main manufacturing operations in St. Louis.
Analysts said they were not surprised by General Dynamics' plans. "Their motives are to be nearer Congress and the Pentagon, where most of their business comes from," said George Shapiro, an analyst with Salomon Brothers in New York. "There's really no reason for them to be in St. Louis."
Don Kling, a spokesman for the Missouri Economic Development Department, said that while he would not like to see General Dynamics leave, the economic loss to St. Louis would be negligible.

DATELINE: TRENTON, June 19

 BODY:
The New Jersey Senate is set to take up legislation on Thursday that would sharply alter the way the state makes laws by allowing citizens to enact or repeal laws through initiative and referendum, a concept with strong grass-roots support in this legislative election year.
Initiative and referendum, "I & R" in statehouse shorthand, has developed into a major political issue in the wake of anger over Gov. Jim Florio's $2.8 billion tax increase last year. Both Democrats and Republicans have introduced bills that would allow the Constitution to be amended to allow citizen legislation. 
 Assemblyman Robert D. Franks, the state Republican chairman and sponsor of one of the bills, said the issue was "the cornerstone of our efforts" in the legislative elections in November, in which all 80 seats in the Assembly and all 40 in the Senate will be on the ballot, which occurs only once every 10 years.
The issue drew important support when the Senate majority leader, Daniel J. Dalton, a powerful Democrat, introduced his own bill.
 
Calling for Action
 "It's time for those who say they support I & R to back up their words with action," he said in discussing the bill to be debated on Thursday. Legislation would have to be passed by late July for the matter to be put on the November ballot.
The Senate President, John A. Lynch, is not a co-sponsor of the bill but he said he could support the idea of initiative and referendum if it could be enacted in a way that would not "be disruptive to the state's government and to its economy."
In the past, the debate has largely split along party lines, with Republicans supporting the citizen lawmaking and Democrats opposed. But Mr. Lynch, regarded as second only to the Governor in legislative power in Trenton, said, "I & R is not a partisan issue and has proponents and opponents on both sides."
Governor Florio is on record as opposing initiative and referendum as "contrary to the principle of representative government," but does not have the authority to veto legislation that amends the Constitution.
 
First Proposed in 1976
 Both inititiative and referendum are forms of popular vote to pass or repeal legislation. Broadly speaking, an initiative proposes a new law and a referendum repeals or upholds an existing one.
Initiative and referendum is not a new issue in the state. The Republican Party has included it in its platform for over a decade, and measures establishing citizen lawmaking have passed one house or the other in the Legislature, but never both, three times since it was first proposed in 1976.
Past efforts have foundered for several reasons:
*Business and industry generally fear that voters would shift taxes from personal-income taxes and property taxes to increased taxes on businesses and corporations. The New Jersey Chamber of Commerce is among those opposed.
*South Jersey legislators fear that the more populous north could dominate legislation, keeping plums like new roads and parks for itself and shifting burdens like prisons and incinerators southward. All the bills before the Legislature include provisions aimed at avoiding such imbalances. They include banning any initiative dealing with the placement of trash incinerators and giving small counties equal weight with large ones in offering initiatives.
*Wary legislators and officials fear that their ability to impose taxes or raise fees could be blocked by citizens with legislative power. Proponents point out that citizens in California and Massachusetts voted just last fall to impose taxes on themselves.
*Even those who support the idea in principle, like Senator Lynch, are wary of "a smorgasbord on the ballot" generated by special interests with the money to pay agencies to gather signatures, which occurs regularly in California, the most active state for citizen lawmaking. New Jersey's proposals would require far more signatures to put an issue on the ballot and would forbid hiring agents to gather signatures. The Dalton bill would require 15 percent of the electorate for an initiative and 10 for a referendum; California requires only 5 percent for either.
 
Citizen Lawwmaking in the West
 Last year, California had 28 propositions on the ballot, only six of which were approved.
The concept of government through initiative and referendum has a long history in the West. Eighteen of the 26 states that allow citizen lawmaking are west of the Mississippi River.
East of the Mississippi, only Arkansas, the District of Columbia, Florida, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan and Ohio empower citizens to inititate statewide legislation, according to the Free Congress Foundation, a Washington public-policy study group that monitors inititative and referendum in the states.
Some states allow direct initiative, others indirect. Direct proposals go directly onto the ballot; indirect proposals must first go to the state legislature for action. If the legislature does not approve the legislation offered in the petition, it then goes on the ballot in the next election.
 
Simple Majority Required
 Once an issue is on the ballot, it is generally accepted or rejected by a simple majority of voters in the case of action that falls short of amending the constitution, like, for example, a measure to ban smoking in government buildings. In some states, constitutional amendment requires a higher percentage of the votes.
The Dalton bill, considered the most likely to go to a vote by the Democratic-controlled legislature, as well as the Republican alternative, provide for indirect methods of passing or repealing legislation.
That means that once a proposal is endorsed by a petition with the required number of signatures it would then go to the Legislature for consideration before being offered to the people in a popular vote. The Dalton bill would require the signatures of 15 percent of registered voters, with approval required in every one of the state's 21 counties to avoid dominance by populous counties.
If the Legislature fails to pass the proposal -- a cut in taxes, for example -- within a certain period, the measure then would go on the next statewide ballot, and if approved by a majority, it would become law.
A major sticking point in the law offered by Senator Dalton is that it gives the Legislature a full year to consider a proposal before it goes on the ballot. The Republican alternative provides only six months.
Phyllis Elston, a lobbyist for Hands Across New Jersey, a statewide tax protest group and a major supporter of initiative and referendum, said that a yearlong wait would be unnacceptable.
"We might prefer no law at all to that," she said.

Prices Rise on Short-Term Issues

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Falling stock prices in the United States and Japan helped to push up prices of short-term Treasury securities yesterday, as investors bailed out of equities and sought a haven in highly liquid Treasury issues.
But the drop in equities did not provide much of a lift for bond prices. 
 "People can't buy enough of issues with maturities of five years or less," one government bond trader said. "And a lot of that may be due to what has been going on in the stock market."
A big drop in Tokyo stocks, with the Nikkei index falling by 2.75 percent overnight, provided an early spur for Treasury prices. The decline in the Dow Jones industrial average, which fell just over 1 percent, provided further incentive to move into Treasuries.
 
Federal Reserve Report
 Traders said release of a report from the Federal Reserve Board's regional banks had little impact.
The report, known as the "beige book," showed that economic conditions across the country improved somewhat in the six-week period ended June 10. At the same time, the report said that most commercial banks remained reluctant to make new loans.
People might have expected the beige book "to be a bit more bearish," the trader said. "But the fact that there was mention of continued credit problems helped offset that."
Michael J. Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc., said the report "was more upbeat than I thought it would be." He added: "It is pretty clear the banks were seeing signs of recovery. Retail sales rose, manufacturing activity picked up and housing demand continued to strengthen."
On the negative side, the report said that despite a pickup in demand for home mortgages, bank lending "continues to be weak."
 
Mortgage Financing Demand
 Indeed, most of the increase in demand for mortgage financing stemmed from homeowners seeking to refinance existing mortgages rather than those looking to buy a home. Business and consumer loan demand is weak, the report said.
Corporations may be eschewing bank borrowing, but new debt issuance by highly rated companies remains strong. Yesterday eight investment-grade borrowers offered investors more than $1 billion in new debt securities.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 95 29/32, up 3/32, to yield 8.50 percent, down from 8.51 percent late Tuesday.
"The failure of bonds to benefit from the bad news on the equity front reflects investor skepticism of claims that the upcoming recovery will be mild enough to allow inflation to engage in an extended decline," said John G. Lonski, senior economist at Moody's Investors Service.
Such concerns were not visible in the secondary markets for Treasury notes and bills.
By late in the day, the 7 5/8 percent five-year notes were offered at a price of 98 14/32, up 1/32, to yield 8.17 percent. And the 6 3/4 percent two-year notes were offered at 99 3/4, up 1/8 point, to yield 6.88 percent.
The Treasury announced yesterday that on Tuesday it will sell $12.5 billion worth of new two-year securities, to be followed on Wednesday with an auction of $9.25 billion worth of new five-year notes.
Following the announcement the two-year notes were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 6.96 percent. The five-year notes were offered in when-issued trading at a price to yield 7.94 percent.
The decline in equity prices helped to push down rates on short-term Treasury bills.
By late in the day, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 5.55 percent, down five basis points, or five one-hundreths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates dipped by four basis points, to a late offered rate of 5.74 percent. One-year bill rates also fell by four basis points, to a late offered rate of 5.94 percent.
Among the investment-grade companies that priced new issues yesterday was the Dayton Hudson Corporation, which sold $100 million worth of 30-year bonds through an underwriting syndicate led by Goldman, Sachs & Company.
The 9.70 percent bonds, which mature June 15, 2021, were priced at $100, or par, 1.18 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds at the time of pricing.
The securities are rated A-3 by Moody's Investors Service and A by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
The First Boston Corporation acted as lead manager for an offering of $250 million worth of 10-year securities for Houston Industries, parent company of Houston Power and Light.
The 9 3/8 percent notes were priced at $99.574, to yield 9.44 percent, 1.10 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing.
The securities are rated Baa-2 by Moody's and BBB by Standard & Poor's.
The focus of activity in the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds centered around Columbia Gas System Inc., a leading supplier of natural gas to utilities in the Northeast.
Columbia's surprise announcement yesterday that it was suspending dividend payments and might seek bankruptcy court protection caused traders to push down sharply prices on Columbia's outstanding debt issues.
For example, bids on a 9 percent issue due to mature in 1993 plummeted by more than 12 points, pushing yields on the securities above 16.50 percent. But traders said that few securities actually changed hands.
Commercial paper traders said that the market for the company's short-term obligations vanished after the announcement. Columbia has about $715 million in total short-term debt, of which some $180 million is commercial paper.
"When the news came over, we all looked at each other and said there is no way that stuff is going to trade," one commercial paper trader said.
Away from Columbia, corporate bond traders said that prices of most issues rose by 1/8 point to 1/4 point.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds, traders said that prices of most widely quoted issues were unchanged on the day.

HEADLINE: Borrowing for F.D.I.C. Backed by House Panel

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 19

 BODY:
The House Banking Committee today took the first step down the road to another costly taxpayer bailout. As the first part of broader banking legislation, it completed a measure that will allow the fund that protects depositors in the nation's banks to borrow more heavily from the Treasury.
The loan, of up to $25 billion on top of the $5 billion in taxpayer dollars now available to the fund, is intended to be repaid by the banking industry over the next decade. But neither the lawmakers nor the White House are sure the banks will regain enough strength over the next few years to pay it back. 
 A vote by the committee on the banking legislation is still more than a week away, but no opposition to the borrowing provision was raised today, another sign of the emerging consensus in Congress that a taxpayer loan is the best approach.
 
Fund Eroding Steadily
 The fund protects deposits of up to $100,000 and has been financed by annual bank contributions. It has been steadily deteriorating from the growing number of large and small bank failures. By some accounts, it is already nearing insolvency. While the vast majority of the nation's 12,900 banks remain profitable, a growing number of large institutions are beset by troubled loans.
The extension of the fund's borrowing authority has been attached to a proposal by the Bush Administration that would radically alter the banking landscape. It would permit banks to enter new businesses like securities and insurance, open branches more freely across state lines and be owned by industrial companies.
The lawmakers, feeling pressure from voters who are already being asked to pay for the highly unpopular savings and loan bailout, began today's drafting session in a somber mood, clearly concerned about the prospect of a repeat performance.
 
Impact on Economy
 There was also a strong recognition by the lawmakers that the action by the committee and Congress would have consequences that would be felt by the economy long into the future.
"This is one of the most important days in the history of the banking committee," said Representative Chalmers P. Wylie, Republican of Ohio, the committee's ranking minority member.
Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, the Texas Democrat who heads the committee, said: "What we must do is undertake not only to resuscitate the deposit insurance system, but to set about the task of creating a structure that enables banks to survive and prosper in this new and dangerous world of high technology, integrated world markets and extreme competition. This is not an easy task."
The insurance fund now has the authority to borrow up to $5 billion from the Treasury as well as nine times the fund's net worth for "working capital" that theoretically is to be repaid through the sale of assets of failed banks.
 
Relying on Borrowings
 Officials from the insurance corporation have said they have begun relying upon Treasury borrowings since the $2.5 billion failure of the Bank of New England in January.
The White House had sought an increase in borrowing authority of $70 billion: $25 billion to cover bank losses and $45 billion to be used as working capital.
The legislation before the banking committee does not specify the amount that could be borrowed for working capital, but bases it instead on a formula that it not exceed the total of the fund's cash, 90 percent of the market value of its assets from collapsed banks and the $30 billion credit line for losses.
While there is strong support in the House and the Senate for the borrowing provision, the other elements of the Bush Administration's proposal face considerable obstacles.
 
Package Draws Criticism
 Indeed, the package as a whole has already drawn opposition from Representative John D. Dingell, the Michigan Democrat who is chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, which will consider it after the banking committee has completed its work.
The package was also criticized today by Senator Donald W. Riegle, the Michigan Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. In a speech on the Senate floor, Mr. Riegle raised objections to expanding the power of banks to enter new businesses.
Mr. Riegle also said that it might already be too late for Congress to avoid a taxpayer bailout of banks.
"Any suggestion that the adoption of the Administration's broad bill will provide an immediate cure for the banking industry or rebuild the bank insurance fund is highly misleading and inaccurate," said Mr. Riegle, referring to the repeated assertions by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady that a bailout could be averted if the Administration's legislation was adopted. "Legislation cannot turn water into wine and no legislation -- not my bill, not the Administration's bill, not anybody's -- can restore value to assets the marketplace has now written down to much lower levels."
 
Other House Moves
 In other action today, the House Banking Committee approved by voice vote a measure sponsored by Representative John W. Cox, Democrat of Illinois, that would give the deposit insurance corporation the authority to borrow money from banks instead of the Treasury. The measure was denounced as "smoke and mirrors" by Mr. Gonzalez because it would be more expensive for the F.D.I.C. to borrow from the industry than from the Government.
By a vote of 28 to 23, the committee also approved a measure sponsored by Representative Richard E. Neal, Democrat of Massachusetts, requiring banks to disclose to regulators the amount of commercial loans made to small businesses, minority businesses and small farms. Mr. Neal said the measure was intended to assist regulators and lawmakers in keeping track of such loans, but opponents of the measure said it was intended to have Congress manage banks by encouraging them to make more such loans.

HEADLINE: Bush to Lift South Africa Sanctions Soon

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 19

 BODY:
Anticipating a strong challenge in Congress, the Administration intends to certify in the next few weeks that South Africa has met the legal requirements for the lifting of American economic sanctions and then hopes to end the restrictions by mid-July, officials said today.
The officials described President Bush as eager to lift the curbs against Pretoria, which he has often called ineffective, as soon as possible. 
 The 1986 law that imposed the restrictions set five conditions for lifting them and the Bush Administration's position is that South Africa has now met four of the conditions with the repeal Monday of the law that classified South Africans by race. That leaves a final condition, the release of South African political prisoners.
Despite their interest in ending the sanctions, the President and his aides are wrestling with the domestic politics of the move, expecting strong Congressional opposition. They are also grappling with the delicate diplomacy of dealing with the African National Congress, which maintains that there are still many political prisoners.
Administration officials said the United States wants to make its own accounting of prisoners and is determined not to be bound by the congress's accounting. "We have to make our own decision and can't be influenced by what other groups want us to do," a senior official said.
 
Crucial Meeting of South Africans
 But the officials said the Administration has concluded that it cannot move to lift the sanctions against South Africa until after a meeting of the African National Congress scheduled early next month.
By then, officials said, Washington hopes to have accounted for all the jailed South Africans that fall into the American definition of political prisoners. Officials also hope that by then, they will see the results of consultations between the African National Congress and the South African Government on the prisoner issue.
"The key is the A.N.C. meeting," one official said. "We don't want to lift the sanctions with some conditions attached to them, or have the A.N.C. bash us for it after their meeting if their figures on political prisoners don't agree with ours.
"The idea is to talk to everyone about it and get our ducks lined up in advance. By the time the A.N.C. meeting ends, we should have our own work done and be in a position to lift the sanctions if all goes well."
Mr. Bush seemed sure to get an endorsement for ending the restrictions on trade and other commerce when he meets Thursday with Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi, the South African leader of the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party, who has been urging the lifting of sanctions.
Chief Buthelezi said today that the sanctions have contributed to poverty and violence among South African blacks. "This is the time to lift them," he said in an interview on "The MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour," adding, "The devastation they have caused is far too much. I don't think it was the aim of the United States to punish our people."
 
Lobbying in Washington
 But the President is already facing opposition from lawmakers, including the Congressional Black Caucus and anti-apartheid lobbying groups, who are arguing that sanctions should be left in place until a new South African constitution is in place giving blacks the right to vote. Should Mr. Bush lift the sanctions as anticipated, Congress would have 30 days under the 1986 law to overturn his decision.
The constitutional right to vote was not one of the five conditions for lifting the sanctions written into the 1986 law. The Bush Administration's position is that with the repeal on Monday of the last major anti-apartheid law, the Population Registration Act, South Africa has met four of those conditions and that all that remains is the freeing of political prisoners.
The dispute over South African political prisoners centers on those who do not fall easily into the American definition of prisoners of conscience, ones who were convicted of crimes against people or property that they say were connected with their political activity. Estimates on the number of such prisoners range from 100 to 600.

HEADLINE: Kohl Says West Has a Duty to Step Up Aid to Former East Bloc

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BERLIN, June 19

 BODY:
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany said today that "all Western countries" had a responsibility to provide greater economic aid to the Soviet Union and the former Communist countries of Eastern Europe to help them make the transition to free markets. But it is unclear whether Bonn is willing to go much beyond the money it has already committed to the Soviet Union and the former East Germany.
Addressing a group of foreign ministers from the United States, Canada and Europe who are taking part for the first time in a post-cold war session of the 35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, Mr. Kohl said of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union: "Additional assistance is needed to bolster the necessary transformation in the reformist countries, and I would emphasize that this assistance must come from all Western countries. It will be help toward self-help. We know that this is a worthwhile investment in peace and stability."
 
Germany's Own Burden
 The Germans are already committed to giving about $31 billion in grants and credits to the Soviet Union, in part because of Moscow's assent to the unification of Germany. But Bonn, faced with mounting costs in eastern Germany, has recently appeared wary of further large-scale aid programs. 
 Mr. Kohl's appeal is part of the diplomatic maneuvering that has begun among the Group of Seven major industrialized democracies in advance of their meeting next month in London with the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
The United States, Canada, Japan, Germany, France, Italy and Britain are trying to reach a consensus on what if anything to offer the Soviet leader, provided that he agrees to move ahead with free-market and democratic reforms.
It was announced today that the Finance Ministers from the seven countries would meet in London on Sunday, in part to coordinate their positions. New York had been considered a possible site of the meeting.
 
U.S. Shows No Enthusiasm
 Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, in a speech to the Aspen Institute in Berlin on Tuesday, outlined some primarily technical aid programs that the Bush Administration is prepared to offer Mr. Gorbachev if he starts down the path toward "serious" economic change. But the United States, unlike Germany, is markedly unenthusiastic about any vast financial aid to the Soviet Union.
The Bush Administration argues that technical assistance to help the Soviet Union tap its own substantial resources through market incentives is preferable to cash aid, which it has no intention of providing right now.
Many Democrats in Congress are arguing that if the reform process in the Soviet Union is to be stable, Moscow will need the same sort of financial safety net that the West provided Poland -- and that this would mean a commitment of cash.
German officials say they have no intention of dictating what contribution the United States or other countries should make to Soviet change. But Chancellor Kohl and Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher have privately been urging the Bush Administration to be as generous as possible, provided that Mr. Gorbachev reciprocates with genuine reform.
 
Prospect of Refugees
 The Germans say they are motivated by concern that any economic or political chaos in the Soviet Union could become a pressing problem for them, given the prospect of thousands of refugees spilling westward.
German officials view Mr. Gorbachev as an exceptional figure who was prepared to take the politically risky steps that ultimately paved the way for German unification. Bonn feels it is indebted to him and has an interest in preserving his position in power.
Of the $31 billion that the Germans have already committed to Moscow, roughly $8.5 billion has gone toward removing the Soviet Army from East Germany by providing housing and other aid for Soviet soldiers returning home by the end of 1994. The rest involves loans, grants and credits.
 
Challenge in Eastern Germany
 German officials argue that they have already given as much as they can afford to, since they are also spending billions of dollars on bringing the former East Germany up to Western economic standards. They would like to see other Western allies making similar commitments to Moscow in aid, grants, or technical assistance.
"We in Germany know from our own experience that the transition from a centralized command economy to democracy, rule of law and social market economy is long and difficult," Mr. Kohl said, referring to the unemployment and low productivity in the former East German states.
"The huge challenge we are facing in the new federal states foreshadows the problems that the nations of Central and Eastern Europe, including the Soviet Union, will have to cope with," he said. "Their transition to democracy and a market economy demands courage, patience and a strong predisposition for change -- not the least on the part of the people."
The main effort will have to come from the East European nations and Soviet Union, Mr. Kohl said, "but it is in the interest of all C.S.C.E. members that the reforming countries achieve success and that another gulf does not emerge in Europe -- this time through economic disparity."
 
Invitation to Albania
 At the meeting today of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the foreign minsters of the United States, Canada and Europe invited Albania to join the organization after its new Government promised to honor the principles of democracy, human rights and market economics.
Albania's Foreign Minister, Muhamet Kapllani, took his seat at the conference table after declaring that his Government accepted the 1974 Helsinki Final Act, which set minimum standards for human rights in Europe. The Albanians were required to include members of the country's political opposition in their official delegation. Mr. Baker is to visit Albania on Friday.
Albania became the 35th European state to join the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, which produced the Helsinki accords. The organization is becoming an increasingly important mechanism for bringing together the newly emerging democracies of Eastern Europe with those of Western Europe and North America.

Costs of 'Grand Bargain'
 WASHINGTON, June 19 (Special to The New York Times) -- A Harvard economics professor told a Senate panel today that a proposed $120 billion Western aid package for the Soviet economy would cost the Federal Government as little as $3 billion a year for five years.
After testifying before the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs, the professor, Jeffrey Sachs, said in an interview that other countries and lending agencies like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank could be counted on to provide the rest of the money for the aid package.
Mr. Sachs is a prominent member of the group of Soviet and American economists who drafted the so-called "grand bargain," a proposal to link vast Western aid to broad reforms of the Soviet economy. He is the first member of the group to offer detailed figures on how the costs of the plan would be covered. He emphasized that he was providing his own estimates and that the group had not reached an agreement on who should pay.
Mr. Sachs said that Japan could be expected to contribute $2 billion to $3 billion a year if 24 Western industrialized countries all agreed to give aid. If only a few large countries took part in a large aid program, Japan might be asked to give $3 billion to $5 billion annually, he said.
Virtually all of the aid outlined in the "grand bargain" would come in addition to economic assistance previously pledged by governments and multilateral agencies.

HEADLINE: Saga of Milken's 'Dream' (Don't Hunt for Warts)

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, June 19

 BODY:
Michael R. Milken is in jail. Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. is in bankruptcy. The "junk bond" market is in disarray.
But to a loyal former aide to Mr. Milken, and to companies like Safeway Stores, MCI Communications and dozens of others that were financed by junk bonds issued through Drexel, the benefits of the high-yield, high-risk securities and the financial genius of Mr. Milken live on. 
 That, at least, is the theme of a new book and a series of flashy dioramas on Drexel-backed companies that are scheduled to be unveiled Thursday night in Los Angeles at what could be the largest gathering of former junk-bond clients since Drexel's last "Predator's Ball" in 1989.
 
Propaganda or 'Clarion Call'?
 Developed over the last several years, in large part with Mr. Milken's own money, the project could be viewed either as an audacious piece of pro-Milken propaganda or, as the book's dust jacket puts it, an "evocative and clarion call of affirmation" for the values of entrepreneurship and the American business spirit.
The book, "Portraits of the American Dream," was researched and written largely by freelance writers and public relations executives hired by Mr. Milken to help burnish his image prior to his guilty plea on securities-law violations last year. Its development was overseen by Lorraine C. Spurge, a former executive of Drexel's junk-bond department in Beverly Hills, Calif., who has long been close to Mr. Milken and who dedicated the book to him.
"He had the vision, energy and courage to open a closed system so entrepreneurs -- regardless of race, creed or color -- with ability and a dream to go into business could test themselvesin the marketplace," the book's dedication says of Mr. Milken, who is currently serving a 10-year prison term. "He understood that the most important form of capital is human capital."
The dedication concludes, "In factories, offices, homes and communities across the nation, the strength of his vision endures."
The book's 400 pages and plentiful illustrations profile 146 companies financed through Mr. Milken's junk-bond department during the last decade. The book, which also includes essays by the actor Jimmy Stewart and Peter Ueberroth, the former baseball commissioner, extols the role of those companies in creating new jobs and fueling the nation's economic growth.
Somehow, no room was left in the book to mention workers who lost their jobs after Drexel-financed takeovers, the savings institutions and insurance companies damaged by heavy purchases of junk bonds or the default of many Drexel issues.
As the book's dust jacket puts it, " 'Portraits of the American Dream' is no apologia."
 
Excuse for a Reunion
 It is, however, an excuse for the reunion of former Drexel clients. The reception, to benefit Junior Achievement of Southern California, is to have as its co-host Peter A. Magowan, the chairman of Safeway, which went private several years ago with the help of Drexel's junk bonds. A press release said the event would be attended by chief executives and employees of the 146 companies profiled in the book. But it was unclear which companies would actually show up.
The companies profiled in the book include MCI, which is headed by William G. McGowan; Time Warner Inc., headed by Steven J. Ross, and NL Industries, headed by Harold C. Simmons, the corporate raider.
To Ms. Spurge, the book is a long-awaited chance to tell the positive side of what Mr. Milken and Drexel accomplished and to celebrate the drive and hard work behind the growth of American businesses.
"For five years, we didn't talk," Ms. Spurge said, referring to Mr. Milken and his closest associates. "Now it's time for us to talk and to talk about going forward."
But one of the book's writers, Mary G. Gotschall, described the book in more cynical terms.
"One of the things we tried to do in the book was to highlight the instances in which junk bonds had benefited minority- and women-owned companies," Ms. Gotschall wrote in the January issue of Regardies magazine, a Washington business publication. "It was true that you could find a handful of minorities and women who'd prospered thanks to junk bonds, as had many other worthy companies, big and small.
"But the larger story that we carefully omitted from the book -- and that was evident as we sifted through the pages of research on the various companies we were profiling -- was that many of the bonds were going sour," wrote Ms. Gotschall, a former employee of Robinson, Lake, Lerer & Montgomery, a public relations firm that represents Mr. Milken.
Another subject to be avoided, Ms. Gotschall wrote, was "the number of junk bonds that were controlled by a relative handful of corporate titans, and how the bonds had helped them to concentrate their power."
 
Milken Gets a Copy
 Ms. Spurge said she had sent a copy of the book to Mr. Milken at the Federal Correctional Facility in Pleasanton, Calif. "He's satisfied because I'm satisfied," she said of his response.
She said she and Mr. Milken had paid most of the costs of the book, including $1.2 million to print 10,000 copies. Ms. Spurge set up Knowledge Exchange Inc. in Drexel's old offices in Beverly Hills to sell the book to the companies profiled and to anyone else interested.
In this financial transaction, Mr. Milken's former clients will get a better deal than the public: $75 a copy, at least initially, but $100 for anyone without connections to the financier.
Ms. Spurge said 30 percent of the proceeds would go to Junior Achievement, a group that promotes interest in business among teen-agers. The book will not be available in stores.

Bank South Chief Quits

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: ATLANTA, June 19

 BODY:
The chairman and chief executive of the Bank South Corporation resigned today, two months after shareholders complained about the bank's losses.
After the resignation of Robert P. Guyton, Bank South's directors named John C. Wilson as interim chief executive pending selection of a permanent successor. 
 Mr. Wilson is president and chief executive of the Multimart Corporation, an Atlanta-based international marketing company. He is the former chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.
Bank South also appointed Lynn H. Johnston acting chairman. Mr. Johnston is also chairman and chief executive of the Life Insurance Company of Georgia.
The bank's executives said Mr. Guyton offered his resignation early today because he was ready to move on, not because of heat the bank has taken over its recent performance.
Last year, Bank South lost $2.4 million, and its fourth-quarter net income totaled $8.4 million, down 43 percent from a year earlier. In April, Bank South reported a net income of $5.6 million for the first quarter, compared with a net of $11.5 million a year ago.
"I believe we have passed through our hard times," Mr. Guyton said in a statement. "The economy appears to be moving out of the recession and that should allow Bank South to make continued progress at a faster pace."

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, June 19

 BODY:
The Fibreboard Corporation said today that it had appointed an interim president and chief executive and an interim chairman to replace Lawrence C. Hart, who resigned from the positions on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: WNET, Citing Aid Loss, Plans to Cut Staff And Broadcast Hours

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER

 BODY:
WNET, the largest public television station serving New York, announced the biggest budget cuts in its history yesterday, caused in part, station executives said, by what it called a devastating reduction in the allocation for the station in the proposed New York State budget.
Among the actions planned to save about $11 million, the station plans to dismiss 69 employees, eliminate 9 positions at the senior vice president level and to go dark for 12 hours each weekend. 
 None of the programs the station produces for national distribution on the Public Broadcasting Service, including "Great Performances" and "Nature," will be affected, station executives said, because they are financed by outside sources. But the executives said some future projects that might have been backed by discretionary funds may not go forward. WNET produces about 30 percent of the national Public Broadcasting Service programs.
 
Hard Times Ahead
 Bruce Christiansen, the president of PBS, said that other public television stations, including those in Boston and Los Angeles, were facing similar financial problems but that the situation in New York "is not an indicator of a national trend for public television."
"We're in a down cycle right now in regards to some of the stations with state funding," he said. "But we've been in these cycles before. They reflect the tightness of the economy in these states."
William F. Baker, the president of WNET, Channel 13, said the cuts at the station were a reflection of the difficult economic circumstances facing both the country and the area. Public and corporate contributions have been flat for two years, he said, while the costs of operating the station have continued to rise.
On top of these problems, the budget presented by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo proposed a 50 percent reduction in the allocation to the station, to just under $5 million for the station's new fiscal year from $9.8 million, a change that begins today.
George Miles, the chief operating office of Channel 13, said that the station had been working for nine months on a budget-reduction plan and that the news of the cut in the state allocation "hit us like a blow to the chest." "Some of the 69 people we are letting go surely would not have been laid off if we hadn't lost the state money," he said.
 
Station 'Not Optimistic'
 Though the cut in the state allocation was not yet official, Mr. Miles said the station was "not optimistic" that any of Channel 13's money would be restored. He cited an effort by the state legislature to restore $2 million in the budget it sent back to the Governor, which Mr. Cuomo cut again in a line-item veto.
"Devastating is the real word for the effect of the state cut," Mr. Baker said. "Governor Cuomo is in the same spot we're in. We understand that. I'm not going to pick on Mr. Cuomo. We need him as a friend."
Mr. Baker said the budget duress had compelled the station's executives to "completely rethink how a nonprofit organization should operate." Among the decisions was that educational programs would receive the highest priority and that local programming would still be produced in some form.
So the station will continue to produce educational programs for use in area high schools and will run many of these in the hours from midnight to 6 A.M., when teachers record them for later use in the classroom. But all the programming Channel 13 has been carrying from midnight to 6 A.M. on Saturday and Sunday nights will be eliminated.
Channel 13 currently broadcasts two half-hour local programs a day, "Thirteen Live," and "Live Wire." Mr. Baker said the station would preserve some local production though it would probably consolidate the two shows into one.
Reorganizing the staff was the only way to save a significant amount of money, Mr. Baker said. Executive salaries, which averaged from $80,000 to $100,000 a year, were the most logical target for the cuts, he said.
In the new structure, four vice presidents, who were formerly senior vice presidents, will take on additional duties, while three other senior vice presidents will be dismissed. The other two senior vice presidents may be offered other positions, Mr. Baker said. None of those dismissed were identified yesterday.
The station will also cut back its program guide from a monthly to a quarterly publication to save on postage.
The budget-cutting decisions were made yesterday morning after a meeting of the station's board of directors. The news was kept from employees for much of the day. Mr. Baker said: "The shock is rolling down the halls. Nobody expected it to be this deep."
Overall, Mr. Baker said the station would have to get by with less supervision. "But we don't want the quality of our programming to slip," he said. "I know we're taking a lot of risks, but what choice did we have? We are not going to allow this station to go into the red."

HEADLINE: If It Gallops or Waltzes, License It!

BYLINE: By RANDALL ROTHENBERG

 BODY:
Some 5,000 people jammed into the New York Hilton Tuesday to chase turtles. The task was harder than it sounds.
The species involved was Teenage Mutant Ninja, whose likenesses have helped sell more than $1 billion worth of clothing, toys and movie tickets in the last five years. Their would-be emulators included the owners of cartoon characters, sports teams and thousands of other properties, all hoping to lease their names or logos to the consumer-product manufacturers who were also prowling the Hilton's halls. 
 All of them wanted a part of the nearly $67 billion market for licensed goods.
Some of those attending the 11th annual International Licensing and Merchandising Conference and Exposition, which runs through today, were nearly flattened by a galloping bunch of Bart Simpson balloons. Others stopped to watch the Dancin' Grannies, an elderly aerobics troupe from Arizona that wants to put its mark on food, vitamins and action wear for the senior set, as they pranced to a recording of "Boogie-Woogie Bugle Boy of Company B." At another booth, Kilroy (of "was here" fame) peered from T-shirts and underwear.
In all, 161 exhibitors, a third more than last year, set up 356 booths to hawk their properties-for-hire. Their unabashed hucksterism belied the desultory state of the American economy and underscored many manufacturers' and retailers' belief that planting a character on a carton or clothing can provide a hedge against recession.
"In a recession, you're trying to buy some awareness, and licenses give you awareness for not a lot of added cost," said James R. Black, a vice president at Kenner Products, a Cincinnati-based toy company.
According to surveys of manufacturers and retailers by The Licensing Letter, an industry publication, $66.6 billion worth of licensed goods were sold at retail last year, nearly a fivefold increase over the $13.6 billion sold in 1981. Licensees typically pay licensors -- the owners of properties or their agents -- royalties of 5 to 10 percent of a product line's wholesale cost, said Murray Altchuler, the executive director of the International Licensing Industry Merchandisers' Association.
Some licensors and licensees have done fabulously. Major League Baseball Properties and N.F.L. Properties each sell in excess of $1 billion worth of merchandise annually, Mr. Altchuler said.
But it was the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, socially conscious reptiles that started as a countercultural comic-book creation in 1983 and last year sold $500 million worth of toys alone, that played on the hopes of those at the conference.
"The Turtle wave is about to break, and we're trying to capitalize on it," said Kenneth Freda, the director of licensing and promotion for TTC Animation Licensing, who said his Brooklyn company had invested close to $1 million developing the Toysters, who he described as "eight characters who defend the rights of toys to make kids happy."
 
Green Is the Color
 The Turtles' environmental activism generated the most competition. Green characters -- in color and in concern -- abounded. Among the new creatures being offered for license were the Toxic Crusaders, described as "environmentally informed and hideously deformed," on buttons being passed out by their creators, Troma Inc., the New York producer of "B" movies.
Earth Air Water Wear, a Tennessee company, was promoting the Frogballs, which Kim Osborne, one of their creators, said were "tree frogs in Brazil who were burned out of their homes" by developers and decided to go on "the international volleyball circuit to tell people about the environment."
Ms. Osborne punctuated her story by pulling an enormous live frog from a makeshift pond in her booth. Upon questioning, she conceded that it was not a Brazilian tree frog, but a bullfrog from Sacramento, Calif.
 
Novelty vs. Nostalgia
 Some at the show said the drive for novelty was misplaced, and maintained that the recession was pushing marketers to the tried-and-true names of yesteryear, like Bullwinkle J. Moose and Rocket J. Squirrel.
'We see the hot properties taking a rest and the classics getting stronger," said Don Ratner, the president of Natural Kids Foods, a Westlake, Calif., maker of juice boxes. Parents in their 30's and 40's fondly remember these characters, he explained, and they are being introduced to a new generation of children via cable-television reruns.
Larry Tetenbaum said he had invested more than $500,000 in his leap of faith into yesteryear. His company, Allegiance Advantage Inc. in New York, was hawking "Saints G'Lore," saints of the Roman Catholic Church redesigned in contemporary fashion for use on greeting cards, clothing and other products.
To prove the marketability of these "ordinary people who did extraordinary things," Mr. Tetenbaum pulled out charts projecting the population growth of grandparents and other groups he considers his primary targets.
In the end, though, he said market research was beside the point when it came to saints. "I believe in them," Mr. Tetenbaum proclaimed.

HEADLINE: Cost of AIDS Care in U.S. Is Seen at $5.8 Billion in '91

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FLORENCE, June 19

 BODY:
An estimated $5.8 billion will be spent this year in the United States to treat people infected with the AIDS virus, including those with the disease, a Federal health economist told an international meeting on AIDS here today. The figure is expected to rise to $10.4 billion in 1994.
While costs of treating people with AIDS have been estimated in other analyses, the new study is the first to assess the economic effect of treating both those with AIDS and those who are infected but lack symptoms, the economist, Fred J. Hellinger, said. 
 The estimated annual cost of treating a person with AIDS is $32,000 and the lifetime cost is $85,333, said Dr. Hellinger, who works for the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research in the Department of Health and Human Services. Other studies have put the lifetime costs at $40,000 to $75,000.
 
One Million With AIDS Virus
 The estimated annual cost of treating a person infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, which causes AIDS, is $5,150. About one million people in the United States are infected with the virus.
The $5.8 billion figure represents about 0.86 percent of the $671 billion spent on health care in the United States, Dr. Hellinger said.
Previous estimates have understated the costs of medical care because they were limited to AIDS, he said. But, he added, the costs have significantly increased since people with AIDS are living longer because of the introduction of new treatments. Such therapies are being used by 25 percent of the people infected with the AIDS virus but without symptoms.
Dr. Hellinger said that Medicaid, the Federal-state health insurance program for the poor, paid 40 percent of the costs of caring for people with the virus and that private health insurers paid 40 percent. The remaining 20 percent of the cost, representing the uninsured, is often borne by hospitals that care for AIDS patients.
Dr. Hellinger said he could offer no comparative figures for other diseases. The National Cancer Institute estimates that about $35.3 billion was spent on treating all people with cancer last year in the United States. About $20,000 is spent treating a person with lung cancer over a lifetime and about $59,000 is spent treating a person with breast cancer over a lifetime.
The American Heart Association estimates that $101.3 billion was spent on treating all people with cardiovascular diseases in the United States last year. Of that, $44.5 billion was spent treating heart disease patients alone.
In his analysis, Dr. Hellinger drew on data from many studies of the costs of care for HIV in medical centers in several cities from 1984 to 1990. He said his figures could rise, depending on the use of several new costly drugs like erythropoietin for HIV.
In another report, scientists from Boston said findings from their laboratory experiments might explain how HIV begins to infect the body after sexual intercourse and might open new avenues of research toward a vaccine for AIDS. The AIDS virus is known to be transmitted in blood and through sexual intercourse. Although the route of access through blood is easily understood, scientists have been puzzled about how HIV invades the body through the genital or anal areas.
Some experts believe HIV can enter only directly through blood, like from rough sex. Others believe that the virus can enter directly through genital contact similar to the way the microbes that cause gonorrhea and syphilis do. While the mechanism for the gonorrhea and syphilis microbes is not completely known, scientists have found that certain structural components of the bacterium that causes gonorrhea allows it to attach to cells on the mucous membranes of the genital areas.
The Boston scientists found that, in laboratory experiments, a certain type of cell on the surface of mucous membranes that cover the skin in areas like the vagina, anus and urethra is sensitive to infection by very small amounts of HIV. After the cell is infected, it becomes a nonstop factory for HIV, producing large amounts of the virus without being killed. The cell is a form of white blood cell known as a dendritic cell and lives for many years.
The scientists from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute speculated that for unknown reasons the dendritic cell may serve as a privileged site for replication of HIV, out of range of certain immune defenses and even drugs.

Group May Shun U.S. AIDS Parley
 FLORENCE, June 19 (AP) -- A group of scientists today threatened to withdraw sponsorship of next year's international meeting on AIDS, to be held in Boston, unless the United States lifted its ban on entry by people infected with the AIDS virus. The group, the International AIDS Society, made up of leading researchers on the disease, is a major sponsor of the annual conference.

HEADLINE: Natural Gas Issues Lead Retreat in Stock Market

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
The stock market was battered yesterday, largely because of the poor performance of natural gas company issues.
With volume on the New York Stock Exchange a relatively low 159.7 million shares or slightly above Tuesday's 156.3 million, the few big losers weighed down all the popular indexes. In all, 414 Big Board issues advanced and 1,156 declined. 
By far the largest price drop was posted by Columbia Gas System, which announced it was omitting a dividend payment and was considering bankruptcy. Columbia Gas rallied late in the session and closed down 13 3/4, at 20 3/4. It was the most active Big Board issue, on a turnover of 4.4 million shares.
 
Dow Utility Average Falls
 Columbia's woes depressed other natural gas stocks. Consolidated Natural Gas fell 1 3/4, to 39 1/2; Panhandle Eastern, 1 1/8, to 11 1/4; Transco Energy, 1, to 32 3/8. The combined losses caused the Dow Jones utility average, which is usually linked to interest rate trends, to drop by 9.87, to 197.25, its lowest level since October.
The Dow industrial average fell 31.31, to 2,955.50; the Standard & Poor's index of 500 shares lost 3.50, at 375.09; the Big Board's composite index declined 1.85, to 205.78; the Nasdaq composite dropped 6.23, to 485.36; the American Stock Exchange's Market Value Index fell 2.67, to 364.73.
"The market was a bit shaky on overnight weakness in Tokyo stocks and subsequent follow-through selling in London and concern about this Friday's 'triple witching hour' when the news about Columbia Gas hit the screens," said William M. LeFevre, senior vice president for market strategy at Tucker Anthony Inc.
 
An Exaggerated Effect
 "While the relatively light volume in a weak market was a somewhat positive, it caused a handful of issues to have an exaggerated effect on the averages," Mr. LeFevre said. "For example, only three of the 15 stocks in the Dow utility average are natural gas companies, but we can see what clout the three -- Columbia, Consolidated and Panhandle -- had on the Dow utility average."
The triple witching hour occurs on the third Friday each June, September, December and March. That is the expiration date for the current S.& P. 500 futures, options on these futures and options on individual stocks. In the past such expiration days have caused severe price volatility in a few hours.
Yesterday, Standard & Poor's introduced a new index, based on 400 stocks with middle-range capitalization. The index moved between 124.95 and 123.34 and closed at 123.54.
In any event, the program traders who use these futures and options as prime operating tools were not much in evidence yesterday. According to Birinyi Associates, there was only one major buy program and two sell programs during the session. The programs lasted for a total of 39 minutes, and their net effect was to reduce the Dow industrial average by 5.15 points.
 
Semiconductor Stocks Decline
 While natural gas stocks dominated market news, the semiconductor sector continued to be buffeted. International Rectifier, for one, plunged 5 5/8, to 16 1/2, and was the Big Board's third-most-active issue, on a turnover of 2.3 million shares. Another weak issue in this group was Intel, which fell a further point, to 47 1/2, in over-the-counter trading .
Also weighing on the market was an increasing number of brokerage houses that are paring their estimates of corporate earnings for 1991 and next year.
Estimates of lower earnings were blamed for Procter & Gamble's falling 2 3/8, to 81, on a volume of 1.5 million shares, which placed it seventh on the Big Board list of 10 most active issues. The same factor caused Pepsico, the second most active, on 3.5 million shares, to slip 1/2, to 29 7/8.

HEADLINE: Hero in His Own Time, Yeltsin Delights Capital

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 19

 BODY:
He no longer has to come in the back door of the White House and beg to see the President. Instead of the 10 Senators he met in the fall of 1989, hundreds of members of Congress waited in line today to shake hands with the newly elected President of Russia and shower him with such gifts as a cowboy hat, a leather belt reading "Boris," and a Senator's spy novel in which he is a character.
And when Boris N. Yeltsin dropped by the Lincoln Memorial this afternoon, history teachers conducting class trips to the nation's capital gave their students an impromptu lesson about the latest Soviet star, who was known around Washington today simply by his first name. 
 "They can't pronounce his last name, so they just call him 'Boris,' " explained Linda Hudson, a 44-year-old history teacher shepherding a group of eighth and ninth graders from Dallastown Middle School in York County, Pa. "But that works out fine, because they watch 'Rocky and Bullwinkle' on cable television at home, so it's an easy mental association with Boris Badenov."
A mental association with the small, dark, oily Russian cartoon spy may not exactly be what the tall, silver-haired Russian leader had in mind for his post-victory tour of the United States, but a little name recognition is always welcome.
There was another interesting mental association in Mr. Yeltsin's choice of the Lincoln Memorial. The first popularly elected President of Russia clearly wanted to bask in the glow of American democracy, as he stood amid a throng of photographers at the base of Abraham Lincoln's feet. But it was Mr. Lincoln, after all, who pointed out the dangers of rending the fabric of a nation to resolve disputes among rivals, when he warned at the Republican state convention in 1858 that "a house divided against itself cannot stand."
As leader of the largest of the Soviet Union's restive republics, Mr. Yeltsin is the embodiment of the centrifugal forces that are threatening to rupture his country.
 
Limits of Support
 In a speech tonight at a Kennedy Center banquet in his honor, Mr Yeltsin set forth the limits of his support for President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
"While Gorbachev stands for reform, while Gorbachev stands for democratic change, while Gorbachev stands for the independence of the republics, Yeltsin stands for Gorbachev," the newly elected president said through a translator.
Earlier in the day at the Lincoln Memorial, John Stewart, 13, sat on the steps aiming his camera in the air. "Do we get extra credit if we get a picture of Boris?" the youngster asked his teacher, Ms. Hudson.
"No," she replied. "You only get extra credit if you know who he is."
Mr. Yeltsin had a mission as he made his rounds today and prepared to meet with President Bush in the Oval Office on Thursday: He wanted to reverse the bad impression left from his last visit, when some of the Washington and international press accounts, which were found later to be greatly exaggerated, painted him as an inebriated and free-spending buffoon. And he wanted to ply some populist one-upsmanship on his rival, Mr. Gorbachev. "He's going to work the crowd like Gorby," the Soviet Embassy press aide, Ivan Rumyantsev, confided in photographers before the Lincoln Memorial drop-by.
 
At the Lincoln Memorial
 After a morning meeting with lawmakers on Capitol Hill, Mr. Yeltsin swept up the steps of the Lincoln Memorial with only a handful of security agents from his country and from the State Department to run interference with several hundred tourists and photographers.
Although he speaks no English, he impressed the crowd with his warm and energetic presence, using an inventive range of hand motions and facial movements to convey pleasure at the crowd's excited reception.
He raised one hand. He raised two hands. He wiggled five fingers. He gave a thumbs-up. He raised a clenched fist. He put his hand on his heart. He raised his eyebrows dramatically. He held up several small girls, judiciously dividing his hugs between blondes and brunettes.
All the twitching and wiggling and grinning seemed to work.
"The stuff with the children, that was good," said Jean Olko, 50, a media-savvy waitress from Garfield, N.J. "He's extending himself to the people."
Mr. Yeltsin also made a hit on Capitol Hill, where he urged legislators to form closer ties between the United States and the Russian Republic and where he once again sounded a conciliatory note toward Mr. Gorbachev.
On the ABC News program "Nightline" on Tuesday night, Mr. Yeltsin had switched his tone about Mr. Gorbachev from soothing to tart, complaining that the Soviet leader makes "halfhearted decisions" and waffles "first to the right, then to the left."
"To a large extent, I don't like him," Mr. Yeltsin said. "He's inconsistent. He has strength for a period of time, and then under pressure from other forces, he may change his decision. That isn't a good thing."
But in meetings with American legislators today, Mr. Yelstin tried to accent the positive, saying that he and Mr. Gorbachev were trying to work together and that Mr. Gorbachev was committed to reform.
In his speech tonight, Mr. Yeltsin cautioned the United States as it considers how much economic aid it is willing to give mr. Gorbachev. He said: "Do not finance the bureaucracy, either central or Russian. Invest in what people do for themselves."
In his earlier meetings with members of Congress, Mr. Yeltsin said that relaxing trade barriers would be welcome. He suggested that the lawmakers earmark any help for parts of the Soviet Union that are moving toward democracy, such as his republic, since any aid to "an unreformed Communist system," as he put it, would not help democracy advance.
"I think he was no doubt chastened by the experience of his first visit and he was bouyed by his recent overwhelming victory," said Senator William S. Cohen, Republican of Maine. "It has transformed his image so that he doesn't need to go through back doors anymore. Now he's emerging as a very important personality."
Senator Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas, presented Mr. Yeltsin with a white cowboy hat and a hand tooled leather belt with "Boris" carved in the back. "The Soviets love all that cowboy stuff," said a Dole aide.
But perhaps the most ingenious gift came from Mr. Cohen, the Maine Senator who is a novelist and the author of a new spy thriller, "One-Eyed Kings," featuring Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Gorbachev as characters.
Mr. Cohen explained the plot briefly to Mr. Yeltsin, explaining that Mr. Gorbachev is overthrown, because of his inconsistency and waffling to the right and left, and that Mr. Yeltsin dies of a K.G.B.-induced heart attack while giving a speech.
When Mr. Yeltsin's interpreter got to the part about his demise, the Russian leader shook his head and waved his hand impatiently.
"Science fiction," he said, in Russian.

HEADLINE: Churches Are Caught in Economy's Grip

BYLINE: By PETER STEINFELS

 BODY:
Many of the nation's major Christian denominations have something in common with the Federal Government, the banking industry and the City of New York: trouble balancing their books.
Although churchgoers are putting more money than ever into the collection plates, many church leaders are staring at deficits. The Roman Catholic bishops are cutting spending, the Evangelical Lutheran Church has begun layoffs, and the Episcopal Church has instituted a hiring freeze.
 
Expenses and Inflation Cited
 These and other national church groups are reducing spending on everything from campus ministries and overseas missions to church publications and work with the aged. Expenses and inflation have outstripped the growth in giving, and local congregations are increasingly reluctant to send money to the higher levels of their churches. 
 Each religious group has its special problems, and denominations differ greatly in how they collect money and what proportion is spent through national offices. But leaders from different churches list similar causes for their financial woes.
Like industry, churches have been hurt by skyrocketing premiums for medical care plans and other insurance. Like local and state governments, they have taken on new responsibilities for the poor or homeless. Like the Federal Government, they confront grass-roots distrust of national bureaucracies.
Church leaders said that most denominations had experienced cycles of tight budgets before, but an unusual number are now facing cutbacks at the same time.
Last week, America's 300 Roman Catholic bishops held their regular spring meeting. The meeting was not open, and the delicate topic requiring secrecy was not doctrine but dollars.
Catholic dioceses across the country, many of them burdened by parishes or schools that are no longer self-supporting, have indicated an unwillingness to increase the amount they contribute to the $34 million operating budget of the national bishops' conference. So the bishops planned to cut spending for 1993 by 3 percent from current levels.
 
Rethinking Church's Mission
 For the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the nation's fourth largest denomination, the moment of truth has already arrived. Hit with deficits at the national level for three years in a row and expecting another one this year, the 5.3-million-member denomination began laying off staff members in May and cutting programs. Church leaders said they would slice $5.2 million from a budget of $84 million through the end of the year.
Last month, the Episcopal News Service reported, "A financial crisis is sending a shudder through all levels of the Episcopal Church and forcing some serious rethinking of the church's mission in today's world." The church recently cut its national budget by 5 percent and has frozen hiring and salaries for 1991. A proposed 1992 budget would cut spending for programs and increase it only for relief efforts overseas.
Also operating under a hiring freeze are the national agencies of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), a denomination with 2.9 million members. The agencies have 20 percent fewer staff members to do the same volume of work they did 10 years ago, and further reductions through attrition are planned.
The denomination has avoided dipping into reserves only by spending less than it had initially budgeted in the last two years. But adhering to current plans would exhaust all the denomination's reserves by 1994 and cripple the church's ability to meet cash flow problems, officials said.
 
Parallels in Jewish Groups
 Even the Southern Baptist Convention, with 14.9 million members and still growing, has seen a decline in the Cooperative Program, which finances most denominational activities. In the early 1980's it was growing at about 8 to 13 percent a year, but in recent years the growth has been less than the rate of inflation.
Parallel trends are apparent in Jewish groups. Fund raising is up, especially for special needs, including the resettlement of Ethiopian and Soviet Jews in Israel. But many synagogues and agencies are facing deficits.
"Synagogues are feeling the pinch even as they try to expand their services," said Rabbi Myron Fenster, president of the New York Board of Rabbis. "Jews are still generous, but selectively generous."
Fred L. Hofheinz, program director for Religion at the Lilly Endowment in Indianapolis, said the financing of American religion has become "a matter of widespread concern" and an important area for research. "We hear one denominational executive after another saying that money is tight and more giving is designated for particular programs rather than general funds," he said. "The patterns are clearly changing."
 
A Majority of Donations
 Church officials are not faulting the generosity of their followers. Only among Catholics is there a question of a decline in giving. In most denominations, contributions have outpaced inflation and managed to offset losses in membership.
About two of every three dollars in charitable donations in the United States were found to go to religious congregations in a 1990 study by the Gallup Organization and Independent Sector, a Washington organization that studies and promotes philanthropy and volunteerism.
An earlier study by the same groups concluded that more than 40 percent of these congregational funds went to support activities beyond religious services and education, primarily general education, health care, international assistance and social welfare.
But if giving has grown, spendin and pressure to retain funds locally have grown even more.
 
Insurance 'Eating Us Alive'
 Health insurance is a major villain. It is "eating us alive," Robert W. Stevens, a church official from Seattle, told the United Methodist Church's Board of Pensions last March.
Mr. Stevens, the chairman of a study group proposing a new churchwide health-care plan, said this week that some of the church's 72 regional conferences faced annual increases of 10 to 40 percent in their insurance premiums while trying to live within no-growth or low-growth budgets. The total cost of premiums for Methodist clergy members and lay employees is estimated at $100 to $125 million a year, and it has been rising at an average of 25 percent a year since 1987.
Unlike many businesses that have faced similar problems with health insurance premiums, churches are reluctant to trim benefits or push costs back on their clergy members and employees through larger deductibles or shared payments. This reluctance stems partly from the major role that clergy members have in church decisions and partly, church officials say, from the sense that clergy members are insufficiently paid.
Another growing burden cited by church officials is the cost of maintaining older churches. Lutheran leaders say that upkeep is now getting costly on a particularly large number of churches built in the two decades after World War II.
Both local congregations and national church agencies have also steadily taken on new responsibilities. Among the new offices, for example, established by the Catholic bishops' conference since 1970 are ones dealing with migration, women in society and the church, Hispanic affairs, science and human values, marriage and family life, black Catholics, farm laborers and evangelization.
In addition, local churches have often taken the lead in providing community services for which government financing have been increasingly difficult to obtain. Congregations have started soup kitchens and shelters for the homeless as well as day care centers, AIDS ministries, drug addiction programs and anti-crime patrols. All this adds to the pressure to keep money locally. The Rev. Joan Campbell, General Secretary of the National Council of Churches, said that a congregation's desire to hold onto money is "not primarily a lack of trust in national offices as much as the satisfaction in seeing the work you're doing."
But many church leaders do not discount distrust as a factor. S. David Stoner, a national officer of the Presbyterian Church, said the churches are influenced by the same attitude that fuels anti-government feeling. "We seem to have an ethos that says I don't trust what I cannot control," he said.
 
More Gifts for Specific Programs
 One result of this distrust is an increase in contributions earmarked for specific programs, a practice that reduces flexibility in national budgets. By designating funds for evangelism programs, for example, conservative congregations have expressed dissatisfaction with national church agencies that advocate liberal causes .
But some Southern Baptist churches have also designated the use of their funds to protest policies by the Southern Baptist Convention's conservative leadership, and moderates in the denomination recently established an alternative fund for steering donations to programs that do not exclude their point of view.
Catholics are one group of churchgoers whose internal differences may be reducing contributions at the parish level as well as nationally. Accurate figures are impossible to obtain, because the 188 Catholic dioceses and archdioceses are financially independent and vary greatly in sharing or making their financial data public.
But in 1987 the Rev. Andrew M. Greeley analyzed polling data about giving. He concluded that while Catholics and Protestants had given the same proportions of their income to their churches in the early 1960's, by the mid-1980's Catholics were contributing only half the amount Protestants were, or 1.1 percent as against 2.2 percent.
Father Greeley, a sociologist of religion who is now a visiting professor at the University of Chicago, matched survey findings on giving and on Catholic opinions. He concluded that half of the decline, which he said had now pushed giving below 1 percent of income, could be attributed to dissatisfaction with church authority, the official condemnation of birth control and church teachings on sex generally.
Comparisons between Catholic and Protestant giving are complicated by many factors, including variations in polling results. Despite those factors limiting Father Greeley's view, "nobody has successfully contested it," said Dean Hoge, a sociologist at Catholic University of America, who is starting a study of religious giving.

HEADLINE: Why India's Unity Matters

 BODY:
Pity India. Not since independence in 1947 has so much conflict beset this huge democracy. A violent election, interrupted by the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi, has left it without a majority party or a visible leader. Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs are mired in quarrels; regions clamor for self-rule, and everyone complains about corruption, the economy and an ossified bureaucracy. The title of V. S. Naipaul's recent book captures the mood -- "India: A Million Mutinies Now."
All this obviously matters to Indians. It should also worry Americans. If chaos triumphs in India, the tremors won't be contained. Indian disunion would be a calamity for human rights. It would fragment markets and accelerate a regional arms race fed by new rivalries. 
 These are reasons enough for New Delhi's politicians to end their quarrels. That won't be easy. Enfeebled by its long dependence on a family dynasty, the Congress Party has no obvious leadership choice. Its dilemma is sharpened by the turbulent rise of a Hindu nationalist party, which placed second in the voting. Unless the Congress Party musters support from other centrists, India's secular tradition is at risk.
Whoever becomes Prime Minister will need to be tutor and taskmaster, surgeon and healer. Growth has slackened, inflation is climbing and just servicing foreign debts consumes 30 percent of export earnings. Opening up an overregulated economy can help. So can a reduction in an ever-rising arms budget. But the paramount task will be to keep India intact. New Delhi has oscillated from appeasement to repression, but to no avail, as communal riots and separatist insurgencies whirl out of control.
History suggests a terrible cost if India dissolves. Tens of millions were uprooted and hundreds of thousands killed when Britain agreed in 1947 to the creation of Pakistan as a separate Muslim state. Partition bolstered the claims of other disgruntled minorities; Pakistan's eastern half seceded in 1971 to become Bangladesh.
If Sikh separatists prevail in Punjab, or if Tamils gain independence, the clamor would spread. Indian states are not ethnically or religiously homogeneous. Disunion means certain upheaval and probable communal massacres.
In times past, awareness of this peril has helped sustain India's secular democracy. Describing India's "million mutinies," Mr. Naipaul also finds a stubborn devotion to democracy among the poor and illiterate. The Indian union, he concludes, has been greater than the sum of its parts: "And -- strange irony -- the mutinies were not to be wished away. They were part of the beginning of a new way for millions, part of India's growth, part of its restoration."
As an anxious world watches, the soundness of his generous vision is now being tested.

HEADLINE: Cameras in Court Benefit the News Media, Not the Public

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"The Public's Right to Public Justice" (editorial, May 31) overstates the case for audio-visual coverage of court proceedings. You refer to "overwhelming evidence that cameras in courtroom are a boon to justice," and yet there is no such evidence. Like the report by the United Court System, you overlook testimony by experienced trial lawyers about the disruption in the courtroom and dangers to the fair administration of justice presented by cameras. 
 Notably absent in your editorial is concern for the pain and suffering caused to a victim of a crime by having that proceeding televised without his or her consent and the risk that witnesses in a criminal case will either conform their testimony to previously televised testimony or refuse to provide evidence at all.
The courtroom may be orderly, but the trial judge can do little to protect witnesses from pressure outside court that may drive them from the witness stand and make them inaccessible to accused citizens who are otherwise unable to establish their innocence. It is wrong to criticize legislators who address concerns about these problems by insisting on protection for victims and accused citizens, like requiring their consent. I have spoken with many state senators and members of the Assembly about this issue, and not one had the "gripes about the news media" that you postulate.
I doubt that allowing cameras in the courtroom has done anything to educate the public, but I doubt more seriously that the news media have attempted to educate the public. Many media witnesses have candidly acknowledged that public education is not their goal. You do not acknowledge the economic interest the media have in being able to bring cameras into the courtroom.
It is not citizens who wish to be educated or civics teachers who are pressing for this legislation. It is the commercial news organizations, which are not nearly so concerned about victims' rights or citizens' rights as our legislators are. The biggest thing going in support of continuation of audio-visual coverage in the courtroom is the fear of legislators that they will be made to pay a price by the news media if they oppose such coverage.

HEADLINE: Not an Extinct Species: Fast Taxi Meters

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
New York City taxi inspectors recently discovered something under the dashboard of a taxicab that caused them great concern: the driver had spliced his radio microphone into his meter so that whenever he pressed the "talk" button on the microphone, an electrical pulse caused the meter to click off extra miles.
Despite the Taxi and Limousine Commission's efforts in recent years to crack down on such practices, there is increasing evidence that fast meters remain plentiful. 
 The radio microphone hook-up was one of the more sophisticated schemes that taxi officials found in recent months.
"It was an ingenious setup that has caused us to start looking more carefully," said Louis C. Calcagno, who directs the taxi commission's safety and emissions division, which inspects meters. The use of fast meters, some taxi drivers and meter shop owners said, has increased because of a weak regional economy in which there are fewer fares.
"You have some drivers out there who have no scruples and will find any way they can to tamper with these meters to earn a few extra bucks, especially when times are hard," said Robert R. Russnak, president of the New York Independent Taximeter Shop Association. While no one knows for sure how many cabbies are using fast meters, taxi officials have several indications that the number is substantial.
One indicator is meter testing at the commission's vehicle inspection center in Woodside, Queens, prompted by passenger complaints.
 
Dramatic Rise in Cheating
 From July 1, 1990, to May 31, 1991, the meters on 341 cabs were tested, the commission's statistics show, and 42 percent were found to be running fast. In the previous year, 366 cabs were tested, and 10 percent were fast.
The increase is so great that commission officials feared the statistics might be wrong.
 Typically, the commission says, fast meters overcharge passengers about 25 cents a mile. Thus a five-mile ride without waiting time, a trip that should cost $8.75, would cost $10 with a fast meter.
The rule of thumb for passengers is that a properly set meter should click off 25 cents every four short blocks.
The taxi meter is connected to the vehicle's transmission and determines how far the vehicle has traveled. The most common way to make the meter run faster is to "zap" it, or connect it to something that transmits an electrical pulse, like the directional signal. But some drivers alter the pinion gear attached to the transmission or manipulate tire pressure or size.
Taxi commission officials said that in recent weeks they had uncovered a significant number of fast meters in spot checks of cabs on city streets.
In one such test on a major thoroughfare in Manhattan on Tuesday, inspectors pulled over Koffi Tsogbe, a 41-year-old cabby from the Bronx, and instructed him to drive down a one-mile test run. The stretch should cost exactly $2.75, because the taxi meter is reset to count only the distance traveled and not waiting time. The commission allows drivers 75 feet of leeway.
 
18 of 43 Fail the Test
 About 250 feet before the end of the one-mile stretch, Mr. Tsobge's meter registered $3. Andres La Salle, an inspector, gave him a summons that requires the meter to be recalibrated before the taxi can go back into service.
Mr. Tsogbe, who has driven a cab for 14 years, complained bitterly that the cab and its meter had been leased.
"This is very unfair," he said. "It's not my fault."
Of 43 taxis so tested in the last week, officials said, 18 failed the meter test.
When a rider complains to the commission that a driver has overcharged by using a fast meter, the agency instructs the driver to go to its center in Queens to have the meter tested. But not all fast meters have been tampered with. Many run fast, commission officials said, because drivers fail to have them recalibrated after repairs or mechanical changes to the vehicle. A new transmission or new tires, for example, may cause the sensitive electronic meters to overcharge.
Technicians at Midtown Taximeter Sales and Service in Manhattan said that of the 100 taxi meters they put through a one-mile test each year, about 20 failed because drivers had tampered with them. "In the past you didn't have as many drivers deliberately cheating people, but it seems to be getting worse," said a technician who spoke on the condition that he remain anonymous.
Taxi commission regulations require drivers to have their meters calibrated and sealed by a licensed taxi meter shop at least once a year. The meter shop performs two tests.
In one, called a bench test, the meter is removed from the taxi and connected to a device that transmits electrical pulses to determine if the meter is registering correctly.
The second test is conducted with the meter inside the taxi. The cabby drives down a one-mile stretch, and the tester observes if the meter is charging the correct amount.
Drivers who fail to have their meters recalibrated after mechanical changes to the cab or who have been found tampering with meters are subject to fines of $25 to $300 and possible suspension or revocation of their hack licenses and medallions.
Fidel F. DelValle, whom Mayor David N. Dinkins has nominated as chairman of the taxi commission, said passengers who believed they had been overcharged because of a fast meter should ask the driver for a receipt and then file a complaint with the commission.
Although some cabbies complain that random meter testing is unfair, Salvatore Saporta, who has been driving a taxi for 22 years, isn't one.
"I like this very much," he said after passing a meter test on Tuesday. "People always complain that we try to rip them off. This test will insure that we are all accurate."

 CORRECTION:
A picture caption on Thursday about a New York City crackdown on fast taxicab meters misidentified the inspector shown. He was Andres La Salle.

GRAPHIC: Photo: The Taxi and Limousine Commission is cracking down on the use of fast meters in taxicabs. Louis C. Calcagno, right, director of the division that conducts inspections, checked the meter of a cab driven by Koffi Tsogbe. A test showed that it was fast. (William E. Sauro/The New York Times) (pg. D1)
 
Chart: 'Being Taken'
 
A properly set taxi meter should click off 25 cents every four short blocks or one avenue block. This is after the drop fee of $1.50 and does not include the extra 25 for every 75 seconds of waiting time and the 50 charge for night fares.
 
Passengers who believe they have been overcharged because the meter was fast should ask the driver for the receipt. The receipt shows the taxi medallion number, the charge and, in some cases, the miles traveled.
 
Complaints should be called in to the Taxi and Limousine Commission at 212-221-TAXI (221-8294). The commission requires drivers who have a complaint filed against them to bring their taxi meters to the Woodside inspection center for testing. (pg. B6)

HEADLINE: The Last Domino

BYLINE: By Sali Berisha; Sali Berisha is chairman of the Democratic Party of
Albania.

DATELINE: TIRANA, Albania

 BODY:
Tomorrow, Secretary of State James Baker will make the first visit by an American Secretary of State to Albania. His arrival will mark one more step in my country's march toward freedom. To continue that march, to consolidate democracy and join the economic community, we need help from the West.
 For Albanians, the U.S. has always been synonymous with freedom and democracy. President Woodrow Wilson kept our neighbors from partitioning our country after World War I. Mr. Baker's visit makes us hopeful. 
Forty-seven years of Communist rule have made us the poorest country in Europe. We are desperate for humanitarian aid -- food and medicine -- as well as technological and economic assistance. Albania needs American business to invest in developing highways, textile industries and oil exploration.
 Albania overthrew the most perverse and militant communist regime in Eastern Europe. In December, students took to the streets and forced the Albanian Communist Party to relinquish its 47-year monopoly on power by holding multi-party elections. Intellectuals and professionals immediately formed the Democratic Party and other opposition groups.
 Though foreigners, rarely allowed in Albania under Communist rule, weren't able to observe this historic event, they were present in March to view the elections.
 The Democratic Party emerged as the main alternative to the Communists. We one-third of the seats in the People's Assembly. Most of our support came from the cities where residents, after four months of activism, were no longer afraid of the Government.
 The Communists won two-thirds of the vote, mostly from the countryside. Foreign observers misinterpreted the results. The rural vote was based largely on fears that are no longer realistic: the Democrats' victory showed the peasants that it was possible to act against the Communists and survive.
 This proved true two months later when 350,000 workers went on strike, demanding higher wages and greater freedom. The support the workers received from the villagers, including food, enabled them to hold out and force the Communists to relinquish power and form a new coalition.
 On June 12, a transition Government with representatives from all political parties was installed. It is expected to preside until new elections are held next year. In recognition of these steps, Albania was admitted to the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe at the foreign ministers' meeting in Berlin this week.
 For students, intellectuals, working people and peasants, socialism is dead in our country as elsewhere, and we are disposing of its remains. Building a democracy won't be easy. Aside from our grave economic problems, we are concerned about the abuse of the human rights of the Albanians in Kosovo, Yugoslavia. A great threat to peace in the Balkans is posed by Slobodan Milosevic, the president of the Yugoslav republic of Serbia.
 Still, with the advice and friendship of the United States, I am certain that Albania will soon make its own contributions to the world.

In Promised Land, Jobs Don't Match the Dream

BYLINE: By SABRA CHARTRAND, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BAT YAM, Israel

 BODY:
All over the wide boulevards of this seaside suburb of Tel Aviv, middle-aged Jews apathetically push trash-can carts, brooms and dust pans. Slowly, these street cleaners collect leaves, cigarette butts and other litter.
The work pays about $350 a month. Many doing the work now are recent immigrants from the Soviet Union who held more prestigious jobs there. They say they were scientists, doctors, engineers and the like and are taking jobs like street cleaning in desperation because of the shortage of jobs matching their skills. 
 First-generation immigrants in many countries, including the United States, are often forced to lower their job status and standard of living. But in Israel's case, the problem is particularly acute because there has been an unexpected surge of immigrants at a time when the Government is doing little to invigorate the country's stagnant economy.
Now, news of the scale of underemployment reaching Jews still in the Soviet Union has apparently prompted thousands to delay their move to Israel. Last December, more than 35,000 Soviet Jews immigrated here. But in May, just 16,048 Soviet Jews arrived, hardly more than came in April. Even so, these numbers are astronomical compared with several years ago when fewer than 1,000 Jews left the Soviet Union in a year.
 
'So Tired I Can't Study'
 "I didn't anticipate this," said Maya Stirota, a 53-year-old metallurgist who left Odessa in January. Leaning on her broom on a busy downtown street, she fought unsuccessfully to hold back tears. "I expected we'd have a chance to learn the language, so I could work at an interesting job. But with this cleaning I'm so tired I can't study."
"I was the head of my department," she added, wiping her eyes. Traces of her former life were evident in the blue eyeshadow, pink lipstick and gold and opal earrings she wore to sweep trash. "I had a challenging job, and I never thought I would wind up like this."
Employment for new Soviet Jewish immigrants was until recently considered a secondary crisis. The big problem was housing. But now officials of the Israeli Government, the Jewish Agency, which coordinates immigration, and Soviet Jewish immigrant groups say the housing problem is slowly dissipating. This is in part because new apartments are being built more quickly and because of the vast decrease in Soviet Jewish immigration.
"Employment is the unmitigated disaster," said Deborah Lipson, an official with the Soviet Jewish Zionist Forum, a group headed by Natan Sharansky, the former Soviet dissident. "This is the overriding, overwhelming, sole problem now."
Some Soviet Jews, particularly those who arrived early in the immigration wave, have found jobs in their professions. But now, even those who have finished Hebrew-language studies, passed Government licensing exams or taken retraining courses have increasing difficulty finding jobs. There are simply too many engineers, doctors and scientists to find work in Israel's stagnant economy.
The employment crunch could reactivate the housing crisis, since many immigrants cannot afford their apartments. High rents have already forced some Soviet Jews onto the streets.
Twenty-six families have been living in tents in the northern town of Carmiel for several weeks. After their first year in Israel, they ran out of the 12-month living subsidy the Government gives Soviet immigrants. Because they are either jobless or doing menial work, they could not afford to pay the increasingly steep rents demanded on the open housing market.
"More and more people are finishing their absorption stipend and not finding work," Ms. Lipson said. "They have to live off small unemployment benefits or are getting menial jobs."
"Anybody who doesn't have a Soviet cleaning woman is paying too much," she added wryly.
 
Many Jobs, Little Pay
 One such cleaner is Natalie Shpilko, a 40-year-old mathematics professor from Kiev. She rattled off her jobs as she waited in line for lunch at a subsidized cafeteria opened recently for impoverished immigrants in Ramat Gan, a Tel Aviv suburb.
"I clean apartments, I tutor a child, I do some work for a telephone survey company, and sometimes I baby-sit," Mrs. Shpilko said. "Altogether I earn between 1,000 and 1,500 shekels in a good month," she said. That equals $417 to $625. "But I know a lot of people who can't find work," she added. "I'm lucky."
Everyone agrees that Soviet Jewish immigrants will accept menial jobs as a temporary means to an end. But more and more the immigrants and their grass-roots organizations say such work may be all Soviet Jews have to look forward to.
"There is an atmosphere of concern that the future here is no better than the future in the Soviet Union was," Ms. Lipson said. "So some people are leaving, some are not coming, and those already here are disillusioned and depressed."
She blamed the Israeli Government for not "taking economic action, initiating job projects, creating incentives for widespread foreign investment." But she also emphasized that "the task is overwhelming and the burden is unbelievable.
"The United States, for example, largely limits immigrants to the best, the healthiest, to those who can work," she said. "Israel takes everyone."
It is likely the United States would also struggle if faced with millions of new immigrants in the space of a few years, but that does not stop some Soviet Jews here from wishing they had gone to America instead. Talking of her efforts to go to the United States from Odessa, Mrs. Stirota was so overwhelmed by tears that she could not speak for a few minutes.
"Three months after we came here, we heard we had been approved for visas to the U.S.," she said finally. "Now we have no money. The only thing a Russian woman can do here is sweep streets and clean apartments."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Yen Gains Against Dollar; Gold Closes Slightly Lower

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar retreated sharply against the Japanese yen and ended mixed against other currencies yesterday amid confusion over this weekend's meeting of leading industrial nations. Gold was slightly lower after rising overseas.
In New York, the dollar closed at 138.22 yen, down from 140.05 yen late on Wednesday. Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar fell to 139.20 yen, from 141.10 yen at Wednesday's close. In London, the dollar fell to 138.60 yen. 
 Dealers have been selling dollars recently on speculation that Sunday's meeting in London of the Groupof Seven leading industrial nations will result in efforts to stem the dollar's powerful rally this year.
That speculation was counteracted, however, early in the New York session when the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, indicated that the meeting was unlikely to set a coordinated currency policy.
Helmut Schlesinger, who will succeed Karl Otto Pohl as the head of the Bundesbank, also said he saw no reason to raise German interest rates.
"This left the market in a somewhat confused state. No clear direction has emerged," said David Jaques, a corporate dealer with Barclays Bank in New York.
Market participants said the dollar's sharp fall against the yen in New York was a carry-over from the overnight drop in overseas trading.
With traders focusing on the Group of Seven meeting, the market seemed to ignore negative economic news that might ordinarily have pushed down the dollar, dealers said. The Labor Department reported the number of Americans filing new unemployment claims surged in early June, raising fresh doubts about whether the recession is ending.
The dollar strengthened slightly against the British pound. In London, sterling fell to $1.6310, from $1.6325 late on Wednesday. In New York, the pound bought $1.6355, slightly less than late Wednesday's $1.6363.
Other late dollar rates in New York yesterday, compared with late Wednesday's rates, included: 1.7915 German marks, up from 1.7895; 1.5355 Swiss francs, down from 1.5385; 6.0925 French francs, up from 6.0870; 1,334.00 Italian lire, unchanged, and 1.1415 Canadian dollars, down from 1.14325.
Gold slipped on the Commodity Exchange in New York, falling 60 cents an ounce from late Wednesday's $368. The Republic National Bank later quoted a price of $368, which was off 15 cents from the bank's late Wednesday bid.
In London, gold edged up to a late bid of $367.75 an ounce, from a $367.25 bid late on Wednesday. In Zurich, gold rose to a closing bid of $368, up from $366.90 late on Wednesday. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose 67 cents to close at $368.29.

HEADLINE: Selling Planes That Won the War

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, June 20

 BODY:
President Bush and President Francois Mitterrand of France have recently called for limiting arms exports, but their message has clearly not sunk in at the Paris Air Show, the world's largest showplace for fighter-bombers, attack helicopters and air-to-air missiles.
Since the 10-day show opened on June 13, dozens of combat aircraft have been parked on the tarmac at Le Bourget Airport, including an oversized Soviet MIG-31, a British Tornado GR, a French Mirage 2000 and a stubby Yugoslav G-4 Super Galeb bomber. But the aircraft drawing the most attention among the 400,000 expected visitors is Lockheed's F-117A Stealth fighter, whose pinpoint bombing wreaked so much damage on Iraq during the Persian Gulf war. 
 Though hurt by the industry's downturn, this year's show has become a celebration of the victory of the anti-Iraq coalition. It is certainly not a sober setting for arms merchants to reflect on problems stemming from weapons sales to renegade third-world leaders like President Saddam Hussein of Iraq. The United States Department of Defense, eager to crow about its air superiority in the gulf war and bolster exports for the nation's troubled arms makers, has assembled the largest armada of American aircraft seen at the show in years.
There are Grumman EA-6B Prowlers for electronic warfare, McDonnell-Douglas F-15E fighter-bombers, Boeing Chinook helicopters and General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcons. A battery of Patriot missiles stands in front of the American pavilion, and husky soldiers give out literature about the "combat-proven air-defense system of the free world."
Standing alongside the 15 or so American aircraft are other American troops, many wearing sand-colored desert camouflage outfits during the frequent drizzle this week. "It's great being here," said Lieut. Bill Siegler, 26 years old, a navigator for a Navy F-14. "People who don't speak English come up and say to me, 'Good job, Desert Storm.' "
Lingering excitement about the victory in the gulf has saved the show and its 1,000 or more participants from absolute gloom. The show's two areas, commercial and military, have both fallen on hard times. The recession and the airlines' loss of traffic during the gulf crisis caused a sharp drop in orders for commercial aircraft. On the military side, the end of the cold war and cuts in military spending are making life difficult.
Serge Dassault, chairman of the show and also of Dassault Aviation, has acknowledged that his company, France's largest producer of warplanes, expects revenues to slide to about $2.5 billion this year, from $2.8 billion last year.
While President Mitterrand opened the show, Dassault's new fighter-bomber, the Rafale, serenaded him with dives, rolls, loops and climbs that the American contingent saw as the most impressive of any aircraft at the show.
 
Americans Mostly Grounded
 The airfield, six miles north of Paris, was where Charles Lindbergh landed after his pioneering trans-Atlantic flight in 1927.
Many visitors are disappointed that for all the American combat aircraft on the tarmac, hardly any participate in the daring daily flight displays. The Pentagon paid to fly the aircraft to Le Bourget, but industry executives say they have been asked to pay for any demonstrations. The companies balked because of the costs of fuel and insurance against crashes onto bystanders. Two years ago, a Soviet MIG-29 crashed at the show.
The Department of Defense has said there is no need to participate in the flight demonstrations because the aircraft had shown their capabilities in the gulf war. A popular joke here is, "The most interesting airplane flying in the show is the Stealth, but no one can see it."
Lockheed held a news conference about the Stealth's capabilities, even though Lockheed officials say their only authorized buyer right now is the Pentagon. "I'm here to highlight the capabilities of the Lockheed Corporation," said Jack Gordon, a Lockheed executive who worked on the Stealth. "Our advanced tactical fighter may be available for export one day."
 
Congressmen Stay Home
 Americans are practicing austerity in other ways. Before huge budget deficits and the flap over the use of military and corporate aircraft by John Sununu, the White House chief of staff, up to 100 Congressmen came to the Paris show, where pate and Bordeaux wines abound. Just two Congressmen attended this year, an American official said.
Many American companies, hit by the recession, have also reduced their presence, believing that few additional sales turn up to justify the high cost of participating, often more than $2 million. "I don't know if we sell any more aircraft here, but it's part of the marketing equation so you do it," one American executive said.
Some of Europe's largest aircraft makers have no such ambivalence. At its airport chalet, Dassault, the show's host, has greeted more than 50 defense ministers and armed forces commanders from around the world.
Dassault executives doubt that American and French proposals on arms proliferation will harm the industry, since these restrictions would primarily limit nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, not conventional warplanes.
The French contend that the American makers, despite President Bush's proposals, are seeking to cash in on their gulf war successes by pushing exports more than ever. "The Americans are applying sales pressure everywhere, including in markets we long considered our own," said Charles Edelstenne, a senior vice president of Dassault.
Deutsche Aerospace, a subsidiary of Daimler-Benz A.G., also looms large here. It has rented a gleaming white chalet the size of a Boeing 747, with a dozen bulletproof Mercedes automobiles parked in front like a pack of metallic bulldogs. Now that Daimler-Benz has bought much of Germany's aircraft industry, the Germans palpably want to show that they are again a power in aerospace.
Deutsche Aerospace is the main force behind a German-French-Italian consortium to build an 80-to-130 seat aircraft; the Germans would also be the main shareholder. The aircraft could compete with a proposed 130-seat Airbus jetliner, and Airbus executives fear that Deutsche Aerospace, which is also a large Airbus shareholder, will block the Airbus project in favor of the other consortium's.

HEADLINE: Sanitation Workers Begin Slowdown

BYLINE: By ALLAN R. GOLD

 BODY:
Sanitation Department employees, angry over layoff notices sent to nearly 450 of their colleagues, began a work slowdown yesterday, delaying garbage collection across the city.
It was not clear how long the slowdown would continue. Sanitation Department officials said they might be forced to assign workers on overtime to complete the work of disposal. 
 With talks with municipal unions on averting thousands of layoffs stalled, the job action is the latest problem to confront the Dinkins administration in its budget crisis. Up to 20,000 city workers may be laid off in the next year, but sanitation workers are the only uniformed, unionized employees who face layoffs, a situation they view as a slap in the face.
The slowdown was "well-organized and citywide," said Anne Canty, a department spokeswoman. Some garbage was left on the street, she said; she gave no estimate of how much. The biggest impact of the slowdown, she said, is that the department is being forced to redeploy workers to get its disposal job completed.
 
Union Order Denied
 Ms. Canty said the department was trying to determine if those engaged in the slowdown were violating work rules and subject to discipline. A spokesman for the Uniformed Sanitationmen's Association, Jim Grossman, said that the union had not authorized a job action but that the workers were so angry about the forthcoming layoffs that wildcat actions were possible.
About 200 shop stewards gathered Wednesday night in a "raucous" meeting at union headquarters near the South Street Seaport in Manhattan, he said, observing, "The guys were very, very upset."
Sanitation workers staged a three-day wildcat strike in July 1975 after nearly 3,000 union members were laid off in the city's last financial crisis.
Last April Mayor David N. Dinkins proposed laying off more than 20,000 city workers, including 447 sanitation workers, as part of deep cuts in city services to close a $3.5 billion gap in his $29 billion budget.
At the same time the Dinkins administration began negotiations with the state, the City Council and municipal unions in an effort to avert the worst of the cuts. But the negotiations have made little progress, and city workers have become increasingly disillusioned, especially after the administration began distributing layoff notices at the end of last week.
The Council, vowing to approve no more than $300 million of the $776 million in property taxes that the Mayor wants, is drafting $500 million more in cuts to make up the difference. That would be on top of the $1.5 billion in cuts that Mr. Dinkins has proposed.
On Wednesday night negotiators for the city met for six hours with representatives of the two unions representing nonuniformed employees -- the Teamsters and District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees -- to find savings to avert some layoffs. Afterward both sides said they remained far from any agreement.
Sanitation union officials say one major obstacle is their need for assurances that any sacrifices they agree to will be shared by all city workers, including firefighters and police officers, who have been exempted from layoffs.
Besides the uniformed sanitation layoffs, the department also expects to furlough 250 civilian employees.
 
A Backup of Garbage
 There are now about 6,800 members of the Uniformed Sanitationmen's Association. The union has been working without a contract since its three-year agreement ended last June 30.
Unless the City Council restores funds to the department's budget, fewer workers will be needed because the city's recycling program will be suspended and street cleaning drastically reduced.
By noon yesterday it had become evident a slowdown was under way, Ms. Canty said.
Under normal conditions, after workers finish their collection routes, they have time remaining in their shifts to dump the garbage at a marine transfer station. From there, the garbage is taken by barge to the Fresh Kills landfill in Staten Island.
In the slowdown, Ms. Canty said, some trucks returned to their garages filled with garbage at the end of the 6 A.M.-to-2 P.M. shift. Workers in the next shift had to be re-assigned from regular chores, like garbage collection or street cleaning, to take filled trucks to the transfer stations to be emptied.
The last significant job slowdowns among sanitation workers occurred between 1981 and 1983, when the city and the union were negotiating a reduction in the number of workers on collection trucks from three to two. Both management and union officials agree that the change has saved the city millions of dollars.
 
A Feeling of Betrayal
 Having agreed to those productivity measures, the union members are incensed that they alone among the uniformed services are being asked to absorb layoffs, Mr. Grossman said.
"There's a sense among our sanitationmen that the city has betrayed them," he said.
In current talks with the union, the Sanitation Department has been trying to obtain new productivity savings. The department asserts that in many neighborhoods where residents are recycling newspapers, bottles and cans, the garbage collection crews are picking up as much as 20 percent less tonnage.
Department officials want to extend the collection routes so the crews pick up the amount they had been doing before recycling began. This could save tens of millions of dollars by reducing the number of trucks needed for collection, the department says.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
I.B.M. Sees A Gloomy 2d Quarter

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
I.B.M. told Wall Street analysts yesterday that its earnings for the second quarter were likely to fall below expectations and hinted that new cost-cutting moves could soon lead to further special charges.
The International Business Machines Corporation, based in Armonk, N.Y., also broadened its explanation of why it is ailing as it struggles to return to earlier levels of profitability and dominance of the industry. 
 In April, when it reported gloomy first-quarter results, I.B.M. officials insisted that the company was sound even as it went through changes but that it was being plagued by a dismal economy.
 
Conference Call With Analysts
 But in a 90-minute conference call with financial analysts yesterday morning, the analysts said, I.B.M. cited additional factors dragging earnings down: pricing pressures from competitors and uncertainties surrounding the introductions of new products.
The stock fell, but far less than the $12.75 tumble it took on March 19, when the company warned analysts of its earlier difficulties. I.B.M. shares lost $1.75 yesterday, to $99.25. With 4.1 million shares traded, it had the second-highest number of shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
The company said that while analysts' earnings projections for the quarter had ranged from 50 cents to a $1.10 a share, the actual numbers would be far lower. And while the company said it did not expect a loss, it could not rule one out.
 
Cuts in Earnings Estimates
 A number of analysts cut their earnings expectations for the year, and several said that 1991 earnings of $5 and $7.50 a share were more reasonable than estimates above $10 that many analysts had several months ago.
"In the past they said the problems were all the economy, but I never bought that," said Stephen Cohen, a financial analyst at the Soundview Financial Group.
Company officials said yesterday that they now saw some hints of a turnaround in the economy and expected recovery in the third quarter and modest qrowth in the fourth. But they also said great economic uncertainties remained.
During the call the company said that of its various markets, Asia was likely to be weakest during the quarter, followed by the United States. Europe remained the strongest region, but it had also weakened.
Despite the gloomy forecasts, a number of analysts saw some favorable signs for the future. Mr. Cohen said he was pleased with I.B.M.'s cost-cutting progress. He said the company had indicated that it planned to increase its dividend.
Other analysts said there were a number of signs that indicated I.B.M. was growing more nimble and aggressive in the market place.
"They are moving very quickly in a number of areas," said Daniel Mandresh of Merrill Lynch. "Their talks with Apple and the Wang relationship happened with lightning speed."
This will be the second consecutive quarter that I.B.M. has disappointed Wall Street analysts. For the first quarter, the company's operating earnings plunged 48.7 percent, from $1.04 billion to $532 million, and revenues fell by 4.5 percent, from $14.2 billion to $13.7 billion.
For the last quarter, the company had reported double-digit revenue declines in a number of its product lines, including both mainframe and personal computers.
 
Effect of Product Introductions
 During the conference call I.B.M. said it was feeling the effects of new product introductions in all of its major hardware categories. In areas like its mainframe computer line, short pauses in purchasing can have a devastating impact on revenues in a particular quarter.
The company has recently introduced new models in the mid-range of its PS/2 personal computer family and its AS/400 minicomputer line and is currently preparing to introduce high-end mainframe computers later this year.
"Customers tend to pause and defer purchasing decisions while these transitions are occurring," said Robert Wilson, an I.B.M. spokesman.
In addition, I.B.M. said that more employees than expected were departing under a special incentive plan to encourage workers to leave the company.
Originally, I.B.M. had said that it hoped 10,000 employees would take advantage of the most recent plan, but yesterday it said it expected several thousand workers to take advantage of the program and depart by the middle of the year. Analysts said they expected an additional 2,000 to 4,000 employees to take advantage of the incentive plan, which is named the Voluntary Transition Plan.
Employees have until the end of July to tell the company whether they wish to leave under the plan.
In addition to those who are choosing to leave voluntarily, I.B.M. has reduced its employment this year by another 4,000 by spinning off its Kentucky-based typewriter and keyboard division as Lexmark International Inc.

HEADLINE: Probation and Therapy Help Some Drug Users

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif., June 20

 BODY:
Combining the therapeutic principles of addiction programs and the incentive contracts popular in the juvenile court, a judge here is using the engine of the criminal justice system to prod adult offenders into drug treatment.
The experiment, conducted by Judge Jeffrey T. Tauber of Oakland Municipal Court, has attracted the attention of criminal justice and drug abuse experts, who say it is the first serious effort to get adults charged with drug possession out of the courts and prisons and into rehabilitation. 
 Since the early 1970's, when courts became clogged with marijuana cases, many states have "diverted" certain drug possession cases by allowing defendants to choose a period of supervised probation rather than entering a plea and standing trial. A defendant in a diversion program can avoid a criminal record if there are no subsequent arrests.
 
Critics on the Programs
 Criminal justice experts say that standard diversion programs are usually worthless. They are haphazardly supervised and rarely include adequate drug treatment, and a high percentage of participants disappear or are rearrested.
By contrast, the early results of Judge Tauber's experiment, which began in January, are good.
"Diversion in most places means neglect," said Peter W. Greenwood, a senior researcher in criminal justice at the Rand Corporation, the research concern. "Here they're actually doing something with the cases."
The program in Oakland is built on the four pillars that experts say are the foundation of behavioral change: the speedy processing of cases, contracts with clear rewards and punishments, group therapy sessions and frequent contact with an authority -- in this instance, Judge Tauber -- who dispenses praise and blame like a stern, but attentive father.
"It is very unusual for the stodgy justice system to respond in a psychologically sound way," said Douglas Anglin, the director of the Drug Abuse Research Group at the University of California at Los Angeles.
For participants, the point of Judge Tauber's diversion regime is not merely staying out of trouble. These defendants are expected to participate in a variety of drug education and counseling groups, which simulate the sort of out-patient treatment commonly used for alcoholism and addiction to crack. They also take urine tests at regular intervals to verify that they have been abstinent.
 
Initial Resistance
 The program depends in large measure on the Alameda County Probation Department. At first, several probation officers said, they resented trading familiar tasks like writing reports for new ones like running group counseling sessions and having their discretion eroded. But they quickly found their new roles more satisfying than the old ones and the results inspiring.
"Before I didn't feel I was getting anything out of it or helping anybody either," said a probation officer, Patricia Blades Oneto. "I really like it now. Judge Tauber has made us real partners with the court for the first time."
Judge Tauber has gathered data tracking the first 100 diversion defendants this year and comparing them with the first 100 last year. California law permits diversion for people with no felony convictions in the previous five years and no prior drug convictions. Judge Tauber estimated that one in five drug cases in Oakland, or about 1,200 a year, fall into this category.
The comparison showed that arrests on new offenses have dropped 48 percent, to 36 from 69. If that recidivism rate remains constant, 1,100 arrests a year would be avoided.
Each arrest costs at least $300, according to the Oakland Police Department. The elimination of those arrests, not counting subsequent court and prison costs, would save $330,000, which is about how much the judge's program costs.
Early data also show a sharp reduction in missed court appearances. Among the first 100 defendants, attendance at a diversion hearing, the session in which a participant is assigned to the program, has been perfect, while one-third of the defendants last year did not show up. The dropout rate between arraignment and the granting of diversion -- the time period when defendants are most likely to disappear -- has fallen by 77 percent, largely because the wait has been cut, to the day after arraignment from the previous one of four months. Later in the program, the dropout rate has fallen 40 percent.
 
Rewards for Performance
 It is impossible to predict how the defendants will fare as their supervision continues, or when they are no longer being monitored. The incentive contracts reward good performance in a variety of ways, including a reduction in the term of supervision, which presumably motivates defendants to behave in order to get out sooner.
Judge Tauber, who began his legal career as an environmental lawyer, developed an interest in drug cases after switching to criminal practice. After joining the bench, he requested an assignment that nobody else wanted: handling the drug cases.
"This is the most central problem facing our cities and our judicial system today," he said.
In the courts and corridors here, a sad cast of men and women slump in their chairs, nodding and sniffling from the effects of drugs. Many clutch Bibles or carry squirming children. They are arrested and re-arrested, appearing again and again before the same judges and probation officers.
To try to stop this revolving door, Judge Tauber consulted drug abuse experts, who taught him the tenets of their trade, first among them that a crisis in a drug abuser's life, like an arrest, presents the best opportunity for successful intervention.
In the old system, defendants' assignment to the diversion program would wait while investigators from the probation department wrote long and largely pointless reports. That paperwork has been eliminated.
 
Terms of Contracts
 On entering the program, the defendants sign a contract under which points are assigned to the completion of certain tasks, like attending drug education classes. For those who earn enough points, there is a substantial reduction in the two-year term of supervision and the $220 fee that the state has always required of people in the diversion program.
The orientation, and most other contacts with probation officers, are conducted in groups, a break from common practice. This makes possible frequent supervision with fewer officers, which is economical. Judge Tauber said his motive was to make the program more therapeutic, mimicking successful anti-addiction programs like Alcoholics Anonymous and Smokenders.
Probation officers were trained to run the groups by addiction experts, who say this is one way to reach more people at a time when outpatient and residential facilities are often full.
The contracts take into account the likelihood of relapse among drug abusers and provide for a second chance. Those who do not earn enough points are permitted to repeat each stage of the program once. Those who are thrown out because they fail to earn enough points are allowed one reinstatement. A positive finding on a urine test means fewer points but not automatic dismissal.
 
Some Are Excluded
 This week, during a review of cases, Judge Tauber was by turns strict and lenient. Several defendants who did not show up in court were tossed out of the program and bench warrants were issued for their arrests.
One man, who recently learned he had AIDS, had earned only 2 of 14 points in the initial phase of the program. Judge Tauber put him into custody for failure to follow the regime, then released him several hours later, reinstating him and offering encouragement.
The judge reduced the term and fee for a man who had not attended community counseling, one of the requirements, but who otherwise performed well. The man explained he was uncomfortable talking to a group of strangers. Judge Tauber instructed the man's probation officer, Frank Tapia, to find a counseling situation where that would not be necessary.
The judge's direct contact with defendants is the main predictor for success, many criminal justice and addiction experts said.
"The genius of the operation is the level of judicial involvement," Mr. Zimring said. The law professor added that if such programs were widely used in California, they could reduce the state prison population by 5,000 to 10,000 inmates. The population quadrupled in the last decade, to 101,000.
Dr. Alex Stalcup, a former probation officer and a physician who is advising Judge Tauber, said that personalizing the judicial system would make all the difference.
"This intervention is human," he said. "They have to encounter Jeff, respond to him, say something, do something. This is a very new definition of diversion and word is getting out on the street."

HEADLINE: U.S.-Backed Shift in Policy Is Rejected at World Bank

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 20

 BODY:
The executive board of the World Bank today rejected an agreement made by the bank's management to provide greater private-sector support in developing countries in exchange for United States backing of an increase in the capital of the bank's private-sector lending arm.
Bank and Administration officials said only a handful of the bank's 22 board members endorsed the pact between the United States Treasury and Barber B. Conable Jr., the bank's president, who is a former Republican Congressman. No consensus was reached, and no vote was taken at the tense and somber meeting, the officials said. 
 The board's action was a defeat, both for the Bush Administration, which is pushing multilateral institutions to be less committed to the public sector in the developing world, and for the bank, which is running low on money to lend to third world businesses.
At the meeting, directors representing a wide range of countries -- from poor to rich and spanning the political spectrum -- criticized the bank's willingness to change its policies under United States pressure, an official said.
A World Bank official who insisted on anonymity said that the aggressive American insistence on new policies toward the private sector in the third world had antagonized the executive board.
An Administration official agreed that the policy changes were the sticking point. "There were a lot of fears, a lot of concerns," he said.
One common theme was that the bank might be forsaking its goal of alleviating poverty in the developing world to help third world businessmen, said an Administration official. No meeting was scheduled to break the impasse.
"I think everybody's going to sleep on it," the official said.
The World Bank issued no comment on the board meeting, and canceled a news conference by Mr. Conable that was scheduled for Friday morning.
The bank is seeking a $1.3 billion increase in the capital of the International Finance Corporation, which lends to businesses in the developing world. The corporation has already been slowing its growth of new lending, from more than 20 percent a year in the late 1980's to 4 percent in the fiscal year ending on June 30.
The United States has contributed a quarter of the international corporation's capital and 17 percent of the World Bank's capital, and has a proportionate vote on the 22-member boards of each body, which are separate but identical. Yesterday's session was technically a simultaneous meeting of both boards.

HEADLINE: New Claims By Jobless Rise Sharply

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 20

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing new unemployment claims surged in early June, the Government reported today.
The jobless claims number, which rose 47,000 for the first week of June to cancel out a decrease of nearly that amount the week before, added to conflicting evidence of late about the health of the nation's economy, analysts said. 
 "It's not good news," said Jack Albertine, who heads an economic forecasting firm in Washington. "It may indicate that the economy has not bottomed, or that a recovery had begun and then got short-circuited."
 
'Confusion Reigns'
 Other recent economic data have shown rebounds in factory orders, retail sales and hiring practices. Two weeks ago, the Government said the unemployment rate rose to 6.9 percent, while a separate survey showed businesses adding on more workers.
"It's another sign that confusion reigns relative to the start of this recovery," Mr. Albertine said.
Comparing this recession with past recessions, Allen Sinai, chief economist at the Boston Company, said: "It was much easier with earlier episodes, when we came barreling out, firing on all pistons with explosive jobs growth. That's not happening this time."
Many analysts expect this recovery to be weak and anemic, with various sectors of the economy slow to turn around.
 
Report for Week Ending June 8
 The Labor Department said that for the week ended June 8, there were 448,000 Americans filing first-time claims for unemployment benefits, an increase of 47,000 from the previous week.
In May, jobless claims had fallen for four straight weeks, something that had not happened since 1982, when the United States economy was pulling out of the last recession.
Another sign of weakness seen in today's report was that the number of people actually receiving unemployment benefits during the week ending June 1 rose as well, increasing by 136,000, to 3.6 million.
That figure pushed the percentage of the labor force receiving unemployment aid to 3.4 percent, up from 3.3 percent, meaning that about half of the nation's jobless are receiving benefits.

HEADLINE: California Inches Toward Closing Big Budget Gap

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif., June 20

 BODY:
 With the state wracked by recession and grappling with the largest budget deficit ever faced by a state, the California Assembly passed a $55-billion spending plan today, only 11 days before the new fiscal year begins.
The budget action came after one of the most extraordinary sessions in the Legislature's history. Liberal Democrats pleaded with conservative Republicans to back their own party's Governor, Pete Wilson, and accept his package of cuts in welfare grants and the largest tax increase in state history. 
 The state Senate passed the budget package on Saturday, but until today Mr. Wilson, a moderate, had been unable to persuade enough members of his own party in the Assembly to go along with the compromise he had worked out with Democrats.
 
The Gap: $14.3 Billion
 But the budget battle is by no means over. The Assembly has yet to pass most of the $7 billion in tax increases and cuts in welfare-grant formulas needed to balance the budget as required by law. The unfinished legislation leaves the state facing a $14.3 billion gap between spending and expected revenue.
Still, today's action was considered a major breakthrough in a process that could well influence the future of Governor Wilson, who has been widely mentioned in Washington as a possible Presidential contender.
The Governor had spent most of the week twisting the arms of Republicans in the Assembly, who have fiercely resisted any new taxes without steep cuts in spending and sweeping "structural" changes in state government to prevent spending from consistenly outpacing revenue.
Finally today, nine Republicans broke ranks with their conservative leadership and joined 45 Democrats to provide 54 votes, the bare minimum for the two-thirds margin required to pass budget measures in the 80-member Assembly. There were 23 votes against the package.
The vote came after an impassioned plea for Mr. Wilson's budget from one of his sharpest critics, Speaker Willie L. Brown Jr. of San Francisco, a liberal Democrat. Mr. Brown said there was much in the budget he disliked, but he warned that the state faced a collapse of essential services if the compromise was not passed.
"This is a Pete Wilson budget," he said. "But I am happy to see a demonstration of clear responsibility in this chamber. It is a product of the Democratic process."
In a dig at conservative Republicans from Orange County who opposed the budget compromise, the Texas-born Mr. Brown, a black man who was the son of a railroad porter, said it was essential to the needs of Orange County residents, "who would not want me in their district after sundown."
 
Conservatives' Pleas
 Conservative Republicans issued equally impassioned pleas against the budget.
Assemblyman Patrick Nolan of Glendale, near Los Angeles, said that the state had suffered through 20 years of the "failed policies of socialism" and that he refused to vote for billions in tax increases that would be "pulled out of the productive sector to just maintain the status quo that we all know has failed our people."
But other Republicans, like Tricia R. Hunter of Bonita, near San Diego, said she would vote for the budget on Mr. Wilson's promise to veto it if the Democrats did not agree to various reforms.
Under the compromise reached with the Democrats, the Wilson plan would do the following:
*Increase the state sales tax by 1.25 cents on the dollar and broaden the tax to include newspapers, candy and snacks, bottled water and ship and aircraft fuel. This would raise the sales tax to 8.25 percent in many major cities, costing the average Californian $130 more a year and raising about $4 billion a year.
*Cut grants to Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the major component of the welfare system, by 4.4 percent, a reduction of $31 from the current $694 monthly allotment to a mother with two children. It would also eliminate the automatic cost-of-living increases to such grants, at a saving of $440 million to $455 million.
*Increase taxes from 4 cents to 20 cents a gallon on beer, from 1 cent to 20 cents a gallon on wine and place higher rates on various types of liquor, raising $200 million.
*Freeze salaries of 218,000 state workers.
A spokesman for Mr. Wilson, William Livingstone, said that many in the Assembly had voted "courageously" and that while the process was not over, there was "clearly some momentum."

HEADLINE: Bush Meets and Commends Yeltsin But Cites Support for Gorbachev

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 20

 BODY:
President Bush gave Boris N. Yeltsin a brief pat on the back today for pushing "democratic values and free market principles," but emphasized his own support for the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
"We have been heartened and encouraged by President Yeltsin's commitment to democratic values and free market principles, and we look forward to working with him," Mr. Bush said in a Rose Garden appearance with the newly elected President of Russia before their meeting in the Oval Office. "But at the same time -- I want to be very clear about this -- the United States will continue to maintain the closest possible official relationship with the Soviet Government of President Gorbachev." 
 Mr. Yeltsin had urged Congress on Wednesday to direct help for the Soviet Union to individuals who are moving toward democracy, rather than to "an unreformed Communist system," as he put it.
And today at a National Press Club luncheon, Mr. Yeltsin indicated that the United States would be wise not to wager all its diplomatic chips on Mr. Gorbachev, since, he said, Mr. Gorbachev alone cannot save the Soviet Union. "There is no one, there is no way for one man to preserve the Soviet Union," he said.
But Mr. Bush politely rejected these ideas today, saying his Administration would continue to deal with the central Government of Mr. Gorbachev.
The White House had been fretting over how to strike the proper balance of encouraging Mr. Yeltsin's rush toward democracy without undermining or offending Mr. Gorbachev.
Unlike the last time he was here, in the fall of 1989, this time Mr. Yelsin did not have to come in the back door and bargain for a few minutes of Mr. Bush's time during a meeting with one of his aides. Mr. Yeltsin's resounding victory in the Russian elections has made him impossible for the Administration to keep at arm's length.
Mr. Bush met with Mr. Yeltsin for an hour and 40 minutes in the Oval Office and posed for the cameras in the Rose Garden. But the President, who is a strong believer in supporting the global club of leaders, spent most of his time in their joint appearance praising Mr. Gorbachev.
"He knows," Mr. Bush said of Mr. Yeltsin, "that I have great respect for President Gorbachev, as I do for him, and we have an excellent relationship. And our ability to work together has produced, I think, enormous benefits for both of our countries and it's served the cause of world peace and stability in the world.
"So let's not forget that it was President Gorbachev's courageous policies of glasnost and perestroika that were the pivotal factors enabling us to end the cold war and make Europe whole and free."
Administration officials said this week that they hoped that Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Gorbachev would work together, so any support of Mr. Yeltsin's more dramatic reforms would not be perceived as a threat to Mr. Gorbachev.
But Mr. Yeltsin seemed to want to have it both ways this week on his four-day visit to Washington and New York. He wanted to say, as he did today at the National Press Club, that he has "a balanced working relationship" with Mr. Gorbachev. "It has not been an even relationship," he conceded. "But there has been no rivalry, and certainly no personal hostility. It was, and sometimes still is, a matter of diverging positions."
But the Russian leader is also a skillful politician, and he wanted to cast himself as a man possessed of a bolder, surer vision about how to save the Soviet Union than Mr. Gorbachev has.
 
A Promise to Gorbachev
 When a reporter at the press club asked him whether he would not be urging moderation, too, if he were "in Gorbachev's shoes," Mr. Yeltsin responded: "I shall never step into Gorbachev's shoes. I have promised him that."
He continued, more seriously: "I shall never be an advocate of slow, half-hearted change because this is a mortal danger to our country. If we go along that path, the system will take a revenge on us. It will never let us achieve democracy."
Mr. Yeltsin has been saying this week that he would like all Soviet foreign aid, including money for Cuba, to end, and that he would like large cuts in military spending.
Asked about that today, as he stood beside the smiling Mr. Yeltsin, Mr. Bush said that the Soviets must decide on their own internal policies, but that "they know that we've had our differences on Cuba,and it wouldn't hurt my feelings a bit if they cut off all foreign aid to Cuba."
Mr. Bush's national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, said he thought that Mr. Yeltsin was a different man from the one who met with him in 1989 and lectured the President on the problems of his country.
He said the meeting today had been friendly and "a good opportunity for the two to get really acquainted."
He said the two Presidents had talked largely about Mr. Yeltsin's agenda for democratic change and economic reform and how the United States might assist it.
The possible American initiatives Mr. Scowcroft cited -- training Russians in Western business practices, advising on such problems as food storage and transportation -- were bland in comparison with the much larger aid packages being discussed with Mr. Gorbachev.
Mr. Yeltsin also met with Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher and a group of American business executives to sell the Soviet Union as a good investment, as he will do on Friday when he meets with business leaders in New York. He arrived in New York this evening.
In Washington, Mr. Yeltsin also went to the Pentagon to talk to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney. Mr. Yeltsin told Mr. Cheney that he favored the Kremlin's keeping control of the armed forces but wanted the Russian republic to get control of the defense industries, the Pentagon spokesman, Pete Williams, said.
Mr. Cheney "didn't express any reaction" to Mr. Yeltsin's argument, Mr. Williams said.
Mr. Bush had breakfast with former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain and told reporters he was "picking her brains" about his meeting with Mr. Yeltsin.
"Democracy has come to the Soviet Union," Mrs. Thatcher said, as she left the White House. "It now has to be backed up by full economic reform, with everyone pulling together."

HEADLINE: BERLIN TO REGAIN FULL CAPITAL ROLE

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BONN, June 20

 BODY:
The German Parliament voted by a narrow margin today to move the seat of federal Government 350 miles eastward, from Bonn to Berlin, the country's historic capital.
The vote, taken after nearly 12 hours of vigorous and often bitter debate, was 337 for Berlin and 320 for Bonn, a small city on the Rhine that became West Germany's temporary capital in 1949 pending eventual reunification with East Germany. Over the years, Bonn increasingly took on the look of a permanent capital as its bureaucracy grew and hopes for unification faded. 
 But after the sudden collapse of East Germany's hard-line Communist Government in 1989 and the unification of Germany last October, the question of whether to move the seat of power became a major issue, even though the treaty joining the two Germanys had officially restored Berlin's status as the capital.
Given the huge expenses involved in shifting the seat of Government, the resolution approved today gives German leaders 12 years to make Berlin a fully functioning center of power. Care was also taken not to unduly upset those who campaigned to keep the Government in Bonn.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who favored Berlin, said he was satisfied with the result. But he was clearly anxious not to antagonize Bonn's supporters.
"This is not a ground for celebration," he said on television. "Celebration would mean there were losers and winners and that would be the wrong feeling at this moment."
"This was the correct decision," he added. "For me, this decision is of great importance for the future of Germany."
 
Signal to Easterners
 The vote in the federal assembly was viewed as a signal of support for people living in the former East Germany, many of whom had campaigned on behalf of Berlin. The transfer of Germany's seat of power to the eastern city is expected to bring heavy investment to the region, which is suffering from unemployment and other effects of entering a free-market economy. The decision also symbolizes Germany's ties to the countries of Eastern Europe.
The timetable for the move to Berlin will be mapped out in a series of new laws. Finance Minister Theo Waigel, who voted in favor of keeping the central Government in Bonn, said that parts of the federal power structure would remain here.
"Not everything that is in Bonn must go to Berlin," he said. "I can tell you that in my budget projections through 1995, I don't have any money allotted for this."
Mr. Kohl and Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said after the vote that they did not know how quickly they would move to Berlin.
Foreign embassies will also have to be transferred. The United States and many other nations have held onto buildings that were accredited to the the former East German Government when it had its capital in East Berlin.
The United States is expected to build a new embassy on land near the Brandenburg Gate that was the site of the pre-World War II embassy. The old building was destroyed during the war.
 
No Winner, Mayor Says
 Tonight, Mayor Eberhard Diepgen of Berlin interrupted a television interviewer who introduced him as "the day's big winner."
"I don't feel like a winner, and the city of Berlin did not score a victory," Mr. Diepgen said. "What happened was that the Parliament made an important political decision."
Mr. Diepgen, Chancellor Kohl and several other officials said that some lawmakers appeared to have changed their minds on the issue as late as today.
Before the decision, both sides rejected efforts to reach a compromise.
"The Bonn people are going to ask themselves if they might not have been better off going for a compromise," said Heiner Geissler, a lawmaker who had proposed a two-city capital. Several legislators said that Bonn would need special aid to cope with the economic shock.
"We can't just leave ruins here," said Rita Sussmuth, the president of Parliament.
The vote, which was conducted openly, cut across ideological and geographic lines. Leaders of the major parties and lawmakers from eastern and western Germany spoke on both sides of the issue.
Twelve of the 16 German state governments urged that Parliament choose Berlin. Among them were all five of the states that made up the former East Germany.
Chancellor Kohl attended part of the debate, and spoke briefly. He reiterated his support for Berlin, but said he hoped the debate would not become a source of future discord.
"However the vote comes out, I hope we all understand that it should not affect our duty to help the country grow together," he said.
The treaty under which Germany was united last October designated Berlin as the capital, but did not specify where the Prime Minister and other ministers would work.
"Since we have said that Berlin is the capital, it stands to reason that the Parliament and the Government should be there," said Klaus Reichenbach, one of the first lawmakers to speak in favor of Berlin. Civil but often passionate, it was the most vigorous debate to date in the new Parliament.
 
A Study in Contrasts
 The two cities represent the poles of German society. Bonn is a traditional sleepy Rhine city, eclipsed to a large extent by nearby Cologne and Frankfurt. Berlin is a sophisticated metropolis that was for generations one of Europe's most attractive cities, rivaling London and Paris as a center of creativity.
Once the seat of the Prussian kings, Berlin became the capital of the German empire when Otto von Bismarck unified the country in 1871.
Lawmakers who favored Berlin pointed to the commitment made by West Germany's founders in 1949 to return the capital there.
"The credibility of this Parliament is at stake," said Gabriele Iwersen of the Free Democratic Party said. "It was always understood that when Germany became free and united, Berlin would be the capital."
Lawmakers who favored Bonn argued that it was already a smoothly functioning capital; that to move it would cost an enormous amount of money, and that Berlin's history made it a dangerous choice.
"With the name of Bonn, we associate the longest period of peace enjoyed by any German state," said Labor Minister Norbert Blum.
"Bonn will lose a great deal if it loses the Bundestag," or federal assembly, "and the Government," he said. "Berlin, on the other hand, would win only problems: housing, rent, traffic and environmental problems."
Among those who spoke for Berlin were several former leaders of the non-Communist Government that briefly ruled East Germany in 1989.
"To me, the fact that we are even discussing this question here today is a scandal," the former East German Foreign Minister, Marcus Meckel, said. "We are only asking you to do what you said for so many years you wanted to do."
"A vote for Bonn would be seen as a betrayal by many people in the east who worked and fought for unity," Mr. Meckel said.

HEADLINE: Dinkins to Crack Down on Guns in Public Housing

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins announced yesterday that the city would mount a major campaign to evict public housing tenants who own guns illegally. In a dramatic reflection of his theme, his speech in a Brooklyn housing project was interrupted by the noise of nearby gunfire.
The plan, modeled on programs under which hundreds of drug dealers have been evicted, would be the most sweeping effort of its kind in the nation, although a similar effort has been mounted in Chicago. But civil liberties advocates in New York immediately challenged the constitutionality of evicting people merely for possessing guns illegally. 
 No one was injured when a string of shots rang out across the Cypress Hills Houses project in the East New York section, but some in the crowd of 150 listening to Mr. Dinkins ducked and others started to run.
After a moment of shouts and confusion, the Mayor calmed the jittery crowd, telling them to let the police handle the situation. He then finished his 25-minute speech and stayed to shake hands with residents of the drug-embattled project.
"The irony of it," the Mayor said later. "Here I am talking about gun control and I'm hearing gunshots."
Hearing shots and ducking for cover, people in the audience said later, is a familiar activity in the Cypress Hills Houses, where a 4-year-old was hit in the leg by a stray bullet early Monday.
"To the Mayor, the gunshots probably came as a surprise," said Timothy Luis, who is 40 years old. "To those of us who live here and raise our children out here, the shots were nothing out of the ordinary."
In the last six months, 72 people have been killed and 470 have been wounded by gunfire in public housing projects in New York City, housing officials said.
The program the Mayor announced includes a number of initiatives to rid the projects of people who own guns illegally. The plan would start eviction procedures against tenants who have been arrested on weapons charges, would speed criminal prosecution of the cases and would offer cash bounties to people who tip off the police about residents who keep weapons.
It also calls for the deployment of 63 officers on overtime wages to patrol nine of the most dangerous projects every day between midnight and 4 A.M.
 
'Why Should I Harbor Criminals?'
 "People are living in terror and many are living captive to the inner rooms of their apartments," said Laura D. Blackburne, the chairwoman of the Housing Authority. "It infuriates me because it is not necessary. I have 200,000 good families on my waiting list who want to get into public housing, so why should I harbor criminals?"
Ms. Blackburne and the plan's proponents say they are certain of their legal right to evict people for possessing illegal guns, but civil libertarians say such a blanket rule may run afoul of constitutional guarantees to due process under the 14th Amendment.
"We have serious problems with it because it's another attempt at a shortcut," Norman Siegel, director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said. "What they would have to show in our opinion would be activity that interferes with other tenants and their rights."
Ms. Blackburne and Federal housing officials disagree, saying the state housing authority law and Federal regulations give the authority the right to evict "undesirable" tenants.
"We believe that we have as much right to require occupancy standards as any other landlords," Ms. Blackburne said. "The possession of illegal firearms is a crime and we have no responsibility to house criminals. If we can evict people for keeping unauthorized dogs in their apartments, then we can evict people who keep guns in their apartment."
Ms. Blackburne said the authority would also require all tenants to sign an amendment to their leases specifying that illegal gun possession and drug-related activity are causes for eviction. In addition, the authority will set up a hot line number -- (212) GUNSEND -- for residents to provide information about illegal gun possession to the police on an anonymous basis.
The authority has been successful in ousting residents accused of drug dealing. In addition to using the normal eviction procedure, which can take up to three years, housing officials said, the authority, along with District Attorneys and Federal prosecutors, has also used a state statute, the Bawdy House Law, that allows the evictions of tenants who use their apartments for "illegal or immoral activities," and Federal forfeiture laws to cancel the leases of drug-dealing tenants.
In 1990, the authority evicted 492 families and individuals for drug dealing. None of the evictions have been successfully challenged, officials said.
In Chicago, lawyers for the city's Housing Authority said they had not met any serious legal challenges to evictions for gun possession, although the National Rifle Association has threatened to take the issue before a judge.
There was no evidence that the shots that interrupted Mr. Dinkins's speech were intended for the Mayor, said Vincent Pizzo, the Chief of Detectives for the housing police. He said the shooting was caused by an argument between two groups of young men in front of a Cypress Hills building at 700 Euclid Avenue, which is about a block and a half from where the Mayor was speaking.
A 22-year-old man who lived in that building was arrested last night and charged with firing the shots. The suspect, Ivan McLoughlin, who is unemployed, was charged with reckless endangerment and criminal possession of a weapon.
Mr. Pizzo said the two groups were apparently arguing over drugs or turf. He said the gun had not been recovered.
The Mayor had received an anonymous death threat earlier in the day, but the police discounted it and said there was no connection to the shots.

HEADLINE: Plan to Raise Foreign Cash For Airlines

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, June 20

 BODY:
The Bush Administration will seek legislation to allow foreigners to own up to 49 percent of the voting stock of United States airlines, Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner said today. The proposal is intended to attract foreign capital to shore up the troubled American industry.
In January, Mr. Skinner decided to allow foreign carriers to buy up to 49 percent of the equity of American airlines, but a 25 percent limit remained on voting rights. He said today that the change had proved insufficient to attract as much foreign capital as the airlines need. 
 In a speech to the American Chamber of Congress chapter in Britain today, and at a news conference afterward, he also called for the European Community to begin talks with Washington about an agreement that would replace bilateral aviation treaties between the United States and the 12 individual community members. Mr. Skinner said the Administration, which is negotiating with Canada about opening up domestic markets to each other's airlines, wants an agreement that would deregulate and create much more competition and service in the trans-Atlantic market.
Discussing the need for capital, he pointed out that the downturn in airline traffic caused by the Persian Gulf war and the recession had left several carriers in a precarious financial position. Eastern, Continental, Pan American and Midway have filed for bankruptcy protection from their creditors, and Trans World Airlines is also weak.
He also said that United States airlines needed foreign investment to pay for the large number of new aircraft they had ordered. "U.S. passenger carriers have firm orders for over $47 billion in new aircraft between 1991 and 1995," he said. "Yet a major U.S. financial institution estimates that an additional $11 billion will be required to cover those costs beyond lease financing and returns from operating cash flow."
Mr. Skinner said he had chosen the 49 percent figure because he doubted Congress would agree to allow foreigners to control an American carrier. One issue is national security: During the Persian Gulf crisis, for instance, the Government called on American carriers for help in transporting troops and equipment.
 
Welcomed by Foreign Airlines
 British Airways and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines today welcomed the Administration's decision to seek the change in the law, but said they would be more excited once Congress passed such a law.
Mr. Skinner said he hoped to obtain the change in the foreign-ownership law this year. But he said he was firmly opposed to re-regulation. The Bush Administration is concerned that some in Congress, like Representative James Oberstar, a Minnesota Democrat who is chairman of the House aviation subcommittee, want some re-regulation and might make this the price for allowing an increase in foreign voting rights.
Several European carriers have already bought minority stakes in United States carriers. KLM owns 10.5 percent of the voting rights and 20 percent of the equity of Northwest Airlines. Scandinavian Airlines System owns 18.4 percent of the voting rights and 16.8 percent of the equity of Continental, and an S.A.S. spokesman said the company did not plan to increase that stake. And Swissair and Singapore Airlines each has a stake of about 5 percent in Delta Air Lines, which has a similar stake in them.
British Airways has been eager to buy a controlling interest in a United States carrier that might feed it international passengers. Airline industry analysts speculate that British Airways may be interested in USAir, which has lagged in expanding into the North Atlantic market. A deal that would have given British Airways a sizable stake in United Airlines fell through in 1989.
Mr. Skinner noted that a big obstacle to starting talks on an "open skies" agreement with the European Community was that the community is in the midst of a deregulation process aimed at turning the 12-nation market into a single market with much more competition.
British Airways, Western Europe's largest carrier, has been lobbying for Britain and the community not to negotiate new deals with the United States until European deregulation is completed. Then, it argues, the community would be in a stronger bargaining position.

HEADLINE: At Home Abroad;
Britain And Europe

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

DATELINE: OXFORD, England

 BODY:
Imagine Rip Van Winkle awakening after decades and finding the politicians of his country arguing exactly the same issue as when he went to sleep. That is what he would find in Britain today: the same old arguments, long since threadbare, about Britain's place in a uniting Europe.
Here are the same old fears of wily Continentals and Brussels bureaucrats, the same obsession with "sovereignty." And the same delusion that Britain can go it alone. 
 To find those attitudes still is to confront a painful truth about Britain. The political culture of this country has atrophied. The vision and daring that once put the mark of Britain on the world has shrunk. Mentally, it is a small island.
Forty years ago, when the European Community was formed, Britain stayed out. It was a disastrous decision; the British economy fell further and further behind the Community's. In time Britain sought to enter, and eventually got in. But it has been a grudging member, repeatedly resisting efforts toward greater economic and political unification.
This week the E.C. foreign ministers discussed a draft of a revised Community treaty. The preamble spoke of "a process leading gradually to a Union with a federal goal." This anodyne sentence set the British Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, off like a rocket. Britain could never accept the word "federal," he protested.
Much of the popular British press also reacted with expostulations. Even The Times charged Jacques Delors, the president of the European Commission, with twisting "the federalist screw."
As a matter of dictionary meaning the reaction was preposterous. The word "federal" signifies a political system in which much power is retained by constituent states, as in the United States. But the reaction was a question not of logic but of emotion -- instinctively anti-European emotion.
Then in waded Margaret Thatcher. In a speech in New York, the former Prime Minister condemned the Community's plans to move toward a common monetary policy and a single currency. Britain's Parliament had managed its economic affairs for 700 years, she said, "and most of us think" that that system "should be kept for the next 700."
The speech showed Mrs. Thatcher's true beliefs, concealed to a degree in office. She detests the whole idea of the Community, seeing it as an infringement on British sovereignty. What she wants instead is an Atlantic free trade area including the United States -- and inevitably dominated by it -- with no common economic or political institutions.
Mrs. Thatcher's views have little or nothing to do with reality. For example, she objects to the idea of a single European central bank, arguing that it would end Britain's right to make its own monetary policy. But in fact today the German Bundesbank makes the decisions that matter, and Britain has less input into its workings than it would with a European bank.
The blindness of Mrs. Thatcher, and her detachment from reality, were bad enough. Even worse was the reaction of her successor as Prime Minister, John Major. He fudged and fumbled, as if he were afraid to say anything very definite.
In the last 40 years Britain has had just one Prime Minister who really understood that the country's destiny lay in a uniting Europe. That was Edward Heath, who negotiated Britain's entry into the Community. He denounced Mrs. Thatcher's speech this week, angrily and rightly, but he did not get much support from other politicians.
What is so sad about all this is that the British people and their leaders are missing the chance to take part in a great enterprise. The shaping of a new Europe, slow as it has been and must be, is in truth a political drama of a high order.
Think what America would be like if our Constitutional Convention 200 years ago had been dominated by little minds like most of today's British leaders. The delegates would have been intent on protecting their little state sovereignties, and there would be no United States.
The European Community does not have to end up as a United States of Europe. But it must develop a constitutional faith of its own, a federalism of ancient cultures. Britain of all member states should be playing a full part in the shaping of that future. Alas, there is no sign that it will.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Learning With Yeltsin

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The last time Boris Yeltsin was in Washington he had advice for the United States about how to deal with the Soviet Union. It is lucky we did not listen to him -- lucky for us, for the Soviet people and particularly lucky for Boris Yeltsin.
Mr. Yeltsin then was the leader of the opposition to Mikhail Gorbachev within the Communist Party. In the U.S., he criticized Mr. Gorbachev and said that within a year the Soviet Union might fall into the abyss. 
 So, he said, hurry up and give the Soviet Union loans, credits, technology, build a million apartments for us -- take the heat off and maybe we won't fall in. He sketched out his own goals if he ever had the chance to change the Soviet economy: 10 to 15 percent privately owned, 85 to 90 percent state-owned or collective.
At that time, way back in September 1989, the United States declined the urgent advice of Mr. Yeltsin and of the collection of Soviet and American experts who also were telling Washington to jump in with large-scale aid to save Mr. Gorbachev, or positively rue the day.
Listening to Mr. Yeltsin now, I keep wondering what would have happened if the U.S. had accepted his advice to prop up the then-existing Soviet structure. Certainly the present chance for total change would have disappeared for years. And it is reasonable to suppose that a freshly strengthened Communist machine would have forbidden such nonsense as the free election that has just made Mr. Yeltsin president of the Russian republic.
Now he is giving different and more sensible advice. He is finished with Communism and with Socialism -- none of this about just 10 to 15 percent private. He tells Washington not to give aid either to the Kremlin or Russian bureaucracies. The right way, he says, is through private investment in private enterprise.
The lesson is that Mr. Yeltsin was wrong in 1989 when he urged the U.S. to intervene in Soviet history by massive aid that would have kept the remnant Soviet system alive longer. He has gone a long way since then.
But whole faculties full of American and Soviet economic experts are still telling us it is Gorbachev or disaster, so quick with the billions.
No, the time for help is when we can be sure that aid does not go to saving a system the Soviet people despise -- or into the mattresses of Communist apparatchiks suddenly converted to capitalism.
The Soviet people deserve more than economic change. Free markets yes, but that may take years. The U.S. and all other Western countries are still working on it themselves.
Soviet political freedom -- the right to vote, think, write, believe -- can come quickly and is important beyond Soviet boundaries. Democracies do not go to war with each other.
For Soviet citizens who fought the Communist system while Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Yeltsin were part of it, the litmus test is the K.G.B. Neither have fully committed themselves; the K.G.B. is still too powerful.
After five years in power, Mr. Gorbachev liberated most political prisoners. But the chief of the K.G.B. is very close to him -- ever closer.
In Washington, Mr. Yeltsin says the K.G.B. is a monster. He says he intends to reduce its size, and on Russian soil will be its boss. He says he hopes that one day its job will be limited to fighting crime and protecting human rights.
The millions of Russians who have been sent to K.G.B. political prisons by K.G.B. judges may be sourly amused by the idea of the K.G.B. turning into the Russian branch of the International League for Human Rights. They want no new boss for the K.G.B. and no K.G.B. -- just an accounting of its crimes.
 But Mr. Yeltsin has something essential that Mr. Gorbachev dares not reach out for -- the support of the Russian people, in open election, for himself and the democratic road.
Mr. Yeltsin quit the Communist party on July 12, 1990. It makes me a little queasy for the U.S. to embrace a longtime Communist leader with the enthusiasm that we should save for Communism's victims. But he was elected freely and fairly and he represents hopes for more of the same in the Soviet Union.
So he deserves a clap on the back, and that fine Stetson cowboy hat that Senator Bob Dole gave him. When Mr. Yeltsin visits again and tells us that he has wiped out the K.G.B., we will give him the horse.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Generally Higher and Gold Moderately Lower

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was mostly higher in quiet trading yesterday as the foreign exchange markets awaited the outcome of a weekend meeting of Group of Seven monetary officials. Gold prices fell moderately. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold fell $2.10 an ounce, closing at $365.90. The Republic National Bank later quoted gold at $365.50, off $2.50.
The dollar has soared about 20 percent in recent months on optimism about an economic turnaround in the United States. The improving economy raises the prospects of higher interest rates, which support the dollar by increasing foreign demand for United States investments. 
 Analysts said traders were unwilling to make commitments before Sunday's meeting in London. Finance ministers from the seven nations -- the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- were gathering to discuss the dollar's recent rise and what to do about it.
 
Skepticism Over Group's Stand

Earl I. Johnson, a vice president with Harris Trust and Company in Chicago, said the market was skeptical about the group's ability to agree on a strong stand on the dollar.
"The market will take it as a free license to buy dollars" on Monday if nothing concrete emerges from the meeting, Mr. Johnson said.
Overseas dealers said they expected a communique from the group that would be sufficiently ambiguous to leave the market guessing and remove any incentive to buy the dollar heavily.
The British pound slumped against the dollar, falling to $1.6260 in New York, from $1.6355 late Thursday. In earlier London trading, the pound was unchanged, at $1.6310.
The dollar rose to 138.90 Japanese yen in New York, from 138.22. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar fell 0.05 yen, to a closing 139.05 yen, and in London it was quoted at a lower rate of 138.85 yen.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's prices, included: 1.8015 German marks, up from 1.7915; 1.54785 Swiss francs, up from 1.5355; 6.1225 French francs, up from 6.0925; 1,341.25 Italian lire, up from 1,334.00, and 1.14325 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1415.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday's, included: 1.7990 German marks, up from 1.7953; 1.5460 Swiss francs, up from 1.5375; 6.1115 French francs, up from 6.1055; 2.0265 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0220; 1,338.25 Italian lire, down from 1,338.50, and 1.1428 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1413.
In London, gold fell to a late bid price of $366.80 an ounce, from $367.75 late Thursday. In Zurich, the metal fell to a closing bid of $366.50, from $368.
Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 20 cents an ounce to close at $368.09.
Silver slipped 7.1 cents an ounce on the Commodity Exchange to close at $4.374. In London, silver rose to a late bid price of $4.45 from Thursday's $4.43.

HEADLINE: What Next? The Macaroni Knows

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
Spotting the recession's end is not that hard. Just forget the index of leading economic indicators. Ignore consumer confidence. And don't even give a passing thought to the stock market. Ponder, instead, macaroni and cheese. Kraft General Foods does.
Like ancient Roman priests peering at bird entrails, executives at the nation's largest food company contemplate the vagaries of creamy carbohydrates for clues to the economy. 
 When the country feels flush, Kraft executives say, people buy fancy foods, like caviar or arugula. But when the going gets tough, the tough get macaroni and cheese -- cozy, filling, and, above all, the right price at an average of 54 cents for a 7 1/4-ounce package.
 
Not Scientific but . . .
 If oddball indicators like macaroni and cheese often lack the scientific validity of true indicators, like the Commerce Department's index of leading economic indicators, they somehow seem to make more sense.
When motor-oil sales slump, for example, the makers of motor oil conclude that recession-spooked drivers are skimping on their cars. When sales of cats pick up, pet retailers say people want an animal that does not eat as much as a dog. And apparel makers think that when sales of cheap sweatshirts heat up, it means, well, nobody really knows what that one means.
At Kraft General Foods, executives swear by the macaroni and cheese index. The economy turned down last July, and sure enough, sales of macaroni and cheese turned up. That month, Americans bought the equivalent of more than 53 million boxes of macaroni and cheese of all brands, compared with 50 million in July a year earlier.
Macaroni and cheese is "a classic recession food," said Michael A. Miles, the former chairman of Kraft General Foods who will soon become chairman of the Philip Morris Companies, which owns Kraft.
And at the moment, the macaroni and cheese index is showing some hopeful signs. This year, Kraft expects Americans to buy nearly 748 million boxes of macaroni and cheese, or about 3 boxes each, up 2.9 percent from 1990. That modest gain would be considered a good economic sign, because it would be a reversion to the growth rate of the 1980's, after the 3.4 percent spurt in 1990 at the start of the recession.
Coincidence? Well, yes, maybe. The reason hordes of economists do not feed, so to speak, data on macaroni and cheese into their computers is simple. Sales of the food may signify nothing, no matter how closely they track the gross national product. And even in tough times, people still like their little indulgences, like a fine silk blouse or a dish of rich super-premium ice cream.
In the $5 trillion American economy, there are many events that only seem to be related to other events. Gumming up the economic forecasting game are what James H. Stock, an economics professor at the University of California at Berkeley, calls "spurious co-movements" -- trends that only seem important.
"Technically speaking," Mr. Stock said, "you want something that is not only plausible but is also a stable statistic relating to economic activity over many recessions."
Mr. Stock is a researcher at the National Bureau of Economic Research who is trying to refine the Government's index of leading indicators. His staff has combed hundreds of statistics, looking for good indicators to add to the index. In addition to problems with spotty or otherwise inadequate data, they are bedeviled by real-world changes that invalidate the prospective indicators.
"Let's take drafting paper for architects," Mr. Stock said. "The higher the sales, the more blueprints for buildings, the more buildings get built, the better the economy, right? But sales dropped, not because of economic activity but because architects now use computer-aided design. So the stability of the relationship breaks down over time."
Then there is the motor-oil index, which is sluggish. Valvoline Inc., a leading maker of motor oil, estimates that the sales of motor oil will rise only 1 percent this year, to 593 million gallons, about the same rate as that of 1990 and half the usual rate of increase. "In a recession, people re-examine their motor-oil-changing behavior," said Larry K. Solomon, Valvoline's manager of market analysis.
 
 Pets as an Indicator

Maybe people are staying home and feeding their new cat. The cat index is up. Retail sales of cats in pet stores shot up 66 percent last year, to $25.6 million, according to Pet Supplies Marketing magazine. Sales may be rising because cats are generally cheaper to buy ($20 for a kitten, $100 for a puppy) and cost less to feed (a few ounces of food a day for a cat compared with a pound or more for a dog). On the other hand, sales rose steadily throughout the 1980's, when the economy was expanding.
And on the third hand, the popularity of cats may have nothing to do with the economy. "The cat is a loner, and can pretty much fend for himself for the day," said Hugh E. Bishop, editor of Pet Supplies Marketing. "You've got to socialize with a dog, sometimes a lot."

HEADLINE: Japan's Socialist Party Leader Quits

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 21

 BODY:
The leader of the Socialist opposition, the best-known woman in Japanese politics, said today that she would resign to take responsibility for the party's recent electoral defeats.
The resignation of the politician, Takako Doi, after five years as the leader of the Japan Socialist Party marks the end of a failed revolution in postwar Japanese politics. 
 Her party's tremendous success in the summer of 1989, in the aftermath of an unpopular new sales tax and a huge corruption scandal that engulfed the governing Liberal Democratic Party, led many to predict that Miss Doi could become the first woman to be Japan's prime minister.
But the party quickly floundered amid factional bickering. Most of the disputes centered on whether the party should abandon its more radical platforms -- particularly its insistence that Japan cancel its 30-year-old security treaty with the United States and dismantle its military -- in favor of positions that would attract more mainstream voters.
 
'Time for New Faces'
 Miss Doi, who is 62 years old, referred to that debate in a brief news conference today, saying she wanted to "pave the way for the reform of the party."
"It's time for new faces," she said, looking drawn but somewhat relieved.
While her successor has not yet been officially named, the nearly certain choice is Makoto Tanabe, a senior deputy chairman of the party and the leader of its most conservative faction.
Among party members, Mr. Tanabe has often been charged with working too closely with some leaders of the Liberal Democrats. But his selection would probably quiet speculation that the Socialists will split into two parties.
Mr. Tanabe also lacks Miss Doi's greatest asset: her instant recognizability in a political world that is almost entirely dominated by elderly men.
 
A Forceful Style
 In campaign stops around the country, Miss Doi was known for her forceful, no-nonsense speaking style. It was a style particularly suited for politics here in the summer of 1989, after the Recruit stock and influence-peddling scandal had led to arrests and resignations. Miss Doi capitalized on the anger at the governing party and on the unpopularity of the 3 percent consumption tax.
In that election, the Liberal Democrats lost control of the upper house of Parliament for the first time in 35 years. The Socialists, hoping to build on Miss Doi's popularity among women, started what became known as the "Madonna strategy," fielding large numbers of women for local and national posts.
But after initial success, the strategy quickly faltered. Powerful business groups counterattacked, asserting that the Socialists lacked any vision for the nation and held fast to a platform that threatened economic prosperity. As the Recruit scandal faded, that argument drew many disaffected Liberal Democrats back into the fold.
In elections for the more powerful lower house of Parliament in February, the governing party did much better than expected, losing only 20 of the 293 seats it held before the Recruit scandal. While the Socialists did better than at any other time in recent memory -- winning 26 percent of the seats, up from 16 percent -- most of those gains came at the expense of smaller opposition parties.
Then in local elections in April, the Socialists failed to make any gains at all, even though the Liberal Democrats were badly divided.
 
Party Mishandling Charged
 "A great deal of Doi-bashing has gone on," said Masao Kunihiro, a close adviser to Miss Doi. "But the Socialist Party also handled some things in a miserable, lucrative way. The party thought that it won in 1989 by virtue of its own merits. The real reason was that the L.D.P. committed so many blunders."
Miss Doi herself never seemed in control of the party. A former professor of constitutional law, she is not a member of any of the party's major factions, and was chosen by party elders who badly needed a fresh face to regenerate the party, which has not headed a government since 1948.
The party also struggled with how to tone down its Marxist-Leninist dogma. The left and right wings of the party have spent the last year arguing vociferously over whether to abandon fundamental positions.
In the end, compromises were reached that resolved some issues and sowed even further confusion on others. For instance, drafts of the party's new platform recognize Japan's right to defend itself, but insist that the Self-Defense Forces, as the military here is called, are unconstitutional in their present form. It still condemns the security treaty with the United States, but in more muted terms. It drops some of its objections to building new nuclear power plants, where previously it had opposed all such development.

HEADLINE: I.B.M. Link With Lotus Is Expected

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
I.B.M. and the Lotus Development Corporation plan to announce an alliance based on Lotus software designed to permit groups of office workers to share electronic information and to work on common projects using personal computers.
Analysts and several industry executives said that under an agreement scheduled to be announced at an I.B.M. news conference Monday in New York, the International Business Machines Corporation would agree to use an innovative Lotus program called Notes in its OfficeVision desktop software. 
 The analysts said the Lotus-I.B.M. deal was a good indication of how new software and computer technologies were rapidly changing business alliances and reshaping the computer business.
 
 New Style of Computing

Notes represents a new style of computing, referred to variously as network or interpersonal computing, that is the fastest-growing sector of the computer industry. With Notes, computer users can confer on their individual computers, adding comments and reading those of other participants. Corporations are beginning to link thousands of desktop machines, and as a result they are searching for software that harnesses the power of these networks.
I.B.M. confirmed that the company planned a significant software announcement on Monday, but it refused to divulge details.
The agreement is expected to provide a vital lift for both companies. I.B.M.'s OfficeVision, software that performs a variety of basic office applications, has so far had only a lackluster reception from corporate and business users. Lotus, on the other hand, has been searching for an effective way to market its Notes program, which analysts said required more support from systems departments than other personal-computer programs.
 
 'Marriage Made in Heaven'

"This is a marriage made in heaven," said Stuart Woodring, an industry analyst at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. He added that by using the Lotus software, I.B.M. would also receive a much-needed lift in the effort to market its OS/2 operating system.
The OS/2 program, which is intended to replace MS-DOS so that personal computers can use more memory and therefore run more powerful programs than DOS allowed, was originally introduced jointly by the Microsoft Corporation and I.B.M. in 1987. Few users made the shift, however, largely because of the high cost needed to adopt the program and the lack of advanced applications to run with it.
The new Lotus-I.B.M. strategic relationship is also a further indication of the growing separation between I.B.M. and Microsoft. The two had jointly dominated the direction of the personal computer industry until they separated their software development strategies last year. Microsoft is now at work on its own version of OS/2, called OS/2 3.0, which will run with the its program Windows. Windows controls a personal computer with the aid of a mouse pointing device.
 
 I.B.M. Effort to Get Partners

Since publicly breaking with Microsoft last September, I.B.M. has been seeking out a variety of business partners to help it develop an advanced-software strategy.
Most recently I.B.M. was reported to have entered into discussions with Apple Computer Inc., possibly to help develop an advanced operating system to run on future personal computers.
By contrast, Microsoft officials in Redmond, Wash., have recently begun to express dismay that many companies in the industry appear to be ganging up on it. In a memo written to his senior executives last month and recently reported by a number of newspapers, Microsoft's chairman, William H. Gates, wrote: "Our nightmare -- I.B.M. 'attacking' us in systems software; Novell 'defeating' us in networking and more agile, lower-cost structure, and customer-oriented-applications competitors getting their Windows act together -- is not a scenario, but a reality."
 
 Importance of Lotus Alliance
 Analysts said the Lotus alliance was an important one for I.B.M. because it would give the Armonk, N.Y., computer maker access to software designed for the fast-growing network computing market, which is rapidly providing an alternative to traditional mainframe and minicomputer-based office systems.
"It puts I.B.M. a little ahead of the curve," said Stewart Alsop, publisher of the personal computer industry newsletter PC Letter. He added that it was another indication that I.B.M. was beginning to respond decisively to industry trends like downsizing and network computing.
"It's another reflection of the fear and loathing at I.B.M.," he said. "They're so scared now that they are starting to do the right thing."

HEADLINE: Seidman Asks for Hiring of a 'Strong' Bailout Chief

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 21

 BODY:
L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, proposed today that a "strong" chief executive be hired to oversee the nation's savings and loan bailout and repeated his view that an additional $80 billion would be needed to keep the bailout going.
As part of a proposed restructuring of the Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency in charge of the bailout, Mr. Seidman presented two alternatives that would reduce the role of the F.D.I.C. in the trust agency's operations and would structure it more like a corporation. 
 Speaking before the Senate Banking Committee, Mr. Seidman also denied that he was ousting David C. Cooke, the trust agency's current executive director. "No one has removed or agreed to remove Mr. Cooke in his current position," Mr. Seidman said.
The New York Times reported today that according to Administration officials, Mr. Seidman had decided to replace Mr. Cooke as a way to mollify Congress and win support for further trust agency funds. The agency is facing rising criticism over internal disarray and the rising cost of the bailout.
Mr. Seidman told The Times on Thursday that he had proposed a new position to manage the bailout and doubted that Mr. Cooke would want the job. Mr. Seidman added that Mr. Cooke, a 24-year career F.D.I.C. official, was "committed" to stay in his job only until Mr. Seidman's departure, which is expected in October.
But today Mr. Seidman sought to play down his earlier statements. In response to a question from the committee's chairman, Donald W. Riegle Jr., Democrat of Michigan, as to whether Mr. Cooke was being offered as a "human sacrifice," Mr. Seidman said, "I am not offering up any bodies for sacrifice."
And he praised Mr. Cooke, who was his choice to head the new agency, which was created by Congress in 1989 and has, so far, inherited some $318 billion in assets from failed savings and loan institutions.
"David Cooke has done an outstanding job under very, very trying circumstances," Mr. Seidman said. "He has put a new agency of the Government in operation."
And, he said, Mr. Cooke should not be blamed for any shortcomings of the agency. "If anyone is to blame, it's me," he added. "David is working under my direction."
Mr. Seidman said he would not be in a position to select a new chief executive should his proposal be enacted. And he acknowledged, in questioning after the hearing, that Treasury officials had "indicated they have some concerns about the management" of the trust agency.
For his part, Mr. Cooke, who sat behind Mr. Seidman at today's hearing, expressed "shock" at reports of his departure. At the same time, however, he made a distinction between the chief executive position being proposed by Mr. Siedman and his role at the trust agency, which he said was far more akin to being a chief operating officer who oversees the day-to-day operations of a large organization. "I'm not looking for the C.E.O.'s job," Mr. Cooke said. "My plans don't go beyond my job."
 
 'Will Continue to Serve'
 The trust agency said today that Mr. Cooke "will continue to serve" in his present position.
Under Mr. Seidman's proposal, the trust agency would be restructured to eliminate the role of the F.D.I.C. as manager of the agency. He offered two options -- one that provided for more independence by the trust agency and another, drafted apparently to meet objections from the Treasury Department, that would retain the trust agency oversight board, which would have been eliminated in Mr. Seidman's initial proposal.
"From the beginning, it was thought that the F.D.I.C. involvement should be temporary," Mr. Seidman said. "We've reached the point when the R.T.C. can operate without having the F.D.I.C. as general manager." F.D.I.C. involvement was deemed necessary at the beginning because of the insurance corporation's long history in closing failed financial institutions and selling their assets -- the same task faced by the trust agency.
 
'Normal Authority' Asked
 Mr. Seidman told the lawmakers that he felt the chief executive of this restructured organization should have the "normal authority and power and clear lines of authority" that is found in corporations. He added that the structure of the trust agency, which suffers from overlapping boards and confusing lines of authority "is not used anywhere else."
He said a "national search" should be undertaken to find the new chief executive, and that candidates should be sought from the private sector as well as within the trust agency and other Government agencies.
The pressure for making changes at the top levels of the trust agency has taken on increased urgency since it will soon be coming before Congress to ask for additional funds to continue the savings industry bailout.
Senator Riegle linked the agency's proposed management changes and its need for additional funds. "Unless there is an improvement in the general ability of the operation to function efficiently within an efficient structure, the support is not going to be there for the next funding leg," he said.
Mr. Seidman repeated an earlier estimate that $80 billion more would be needed to finance the bailout. The Administration is expected to ask Congress next week for at least $50 billion more for the bailout.
At the same time, Mr. Seidman repeated a higher set of estimates for the bailout's total costs, reflecting inflation and a decline in real estate values -- which comes to about $135 billion to $150 billion, depending on the number of savings and loan institutions that fail.
But that number does not reflect the total cost of the savings and loan crisis, which could reach $235 billion to $240 billion. That higher amount was arrived at, Mr. Seidman said, by including $66 billion to finance deals completed by regulators in 1988, before the trust agency was created, and $12 billion to $15 billion to refinance the savings and loan industry insurance fund.

HEADLINE: Budget Deficit a Factor as Bond Prices Fall

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices fell yesterday, while most shorter maturities posted modest declines. Dealers attributed the weaker bond prices more to the absence of buyers than any significant selling pressure.
What kept many buyers away, they said, was the record Federal budget deficit of $53.35 billion for May, the relatively large amount of short and intermediate Treasury debt scheduled for sale next week, and the usual caution that precedes a meeting of the Group of Seven nations. 
 While the budget deficit was only slightly higher than the previous record of $53.32 billion of March 1990, it followed a surplus of $30.13 billion reported for last April. The meeting of the seven major industrialized nations tomorrow is expected to ask for measures to reduce the value of the dollar. If so, it would make Treasury debt and other dollar-denominated investments less attractive.
"Also depressing the Treasury market is the relatively large amount of short- and intermediate-term notes on dealer shelves, which reduces the amount of cash available to take up the two- and five-year notes to be auctioned next week," said Andrew J. Schnydrig, Treasury securities trader at the New York branch of Bank Julius Baer of Zurich.
On Tuesday, $12.5 billion of two-year notes will be sold, followed on Wednesday by $9.25 billion of five-year notes. The notes traded on a when-issued basis to yield 6.96 percent and 7.94 percent, respectively.
In addition to the note auctions and a total of $20 billion in the regular Monday sales of three- and six-month bills, the Treasury will offer $12.5 billion of one-year bills on Thursday.
Mr. Schnydrig said that in view of the large inventories of unsold two- and five-year notes from last month's auctions, "the tendency of some market participants is to sell the short end and buy the longer maturities." He added, "But unless the Federal Reserve moves to ease interest rates soon, the reverse course may be the most practical."
In late trading, the Treasury's bellwether long bonds, the 8 1/8 percent issue maturing in May 2021, were offered at 95 28/32, down 15/32 on the day, which caused the yield to climb to 8.50 percent, from 8.46 the day before and 8.45 a week ago. The long notes, the 8's of May 2001, lost 8/32, at 97 31/32, for a yield of 8.30 percent.

 WIDER 8-MONTH GAP
 WASHINGTON, June 21 (AP) -- The Government posted a record $53.35 billion deficit in May, wiping out a surplus in April and surpassing the previous monthly high set 14 months ago, the Treasury said today.
The May imbalance increased the gap for the first eight months of the 1991 fiscal year to $175 billion, up from $151.49 billion in the corresponding period last year.

HEADLINE: GORBACHEV TO MIX PLANS ON ECONOMY OF LEFT AND RIGHT

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, June 21

 BODY:
Confronted with competing economic plans from left and right, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said today that he was preparing to combine them to present to the leaders of seven major industrial nations next month.
His decision not to support in its entirety the radical plan worked out by a liberal economist, Grigory A. Yavlinsky, in collaboration with Harvard economists and instead to seek to merge it with a somewhat more conservative "anti-crisis" reform favored by Prime Minister Valentin S. Pavlov, underscored Mr. Gorbachev's continuing efforts to keep a centrist policy, in the face of competing pulls and tugs. 
 Mr. Yavlinsky said at a news conference later that his program and that of Mr. Pavlov were not compatible. This is a view shared by President Boris N. Yeltsin of the Russian republic, who is now campaigning for reform on a trip to the United States, and by most Western economists as well.
 
Stormy Session of Parliament
 Mr. Gorbachev commented on the programs during a stormy session of the Soviet Parliament at which he fired an unusually fiery broadside at his hard-line critics and stopped the deputies from granting sweeping new powers requested by Mr. Pavlov.
Even though all the evidence during the week was of a fight between Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Pavlov, Mr. Gorbachev insisted that this was not so.
"There is no conflict between the President and the Prime Minister in principle, nor in human or organizational terms," Mr. Gorbachev said. He attributed the widespread reports to the contrary to "hysteria" fanned by his far-right foes.
 
Middle Ground Is Elusive
 Though the day's conflict was with the conservatives, who have not concealed their dissatisfaction over the President's truce with republican leaders and his initiatives to the West, Mr. Gorbachev suggested that he was still struggling to find that increasingly elusive middle ground between impatient reformers on the left and resentful conservatives on the right.
Mr. Gorbachev said his program would include elements of the Yavlinsky and Pavlov plans, plus suggestions from the International Monetary Fund and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
"It will be the program of the President with which I will go to London," Mr. Gorbachev said, referring to the July meeting with the leaders of seven industrialized powers. "There are no contradictions between the 'anti-crisis program' and the blueprints brought by Yavlinsky. Those who want to pass off the first as misconception and the second as brilliant foresight mislead society and provoke misunderstandings and clashes."
He denied that he was repeating the mistake he made last fall when he tried to combine the "500-Day" program of radical economic reforms -- to which Mr. Yavlinsky was a major contributor -- and the Government's considerably less dramatic reforms.
"A premature baby was born then in the form of the 'Main Guidelines,' " he acknowledged. But he insisted that there was no parallel, saying: "We had to cover this stage. Society was ill-prepared, no answers were available, we had to find the common mainstream of movement. We are now reaching a stage when direct action will be taken."
The latest challenge to Mr. Gorbachev took shape Monday, when Mr. Pavlov unexpectedly asked Parliament to give him additional powers independent of the President's. Under the arrangement in force since last fall, the Prime Minister and Cabinet answer directly to the President, who has broad powers to govern by decree.
 
Hard-Liners Watch Grimly
 Mr. Pavlov's request was caught up by the far-right "Soyuz" block and found support among the hard-line security leaders, Vladimir A. Kryuchkov of the K.G.B., Interior Minister Boris K. Pugo and Defense Minister Dimitri T. Yazov. All three sat together in a corner of the Supreme Soviet chamber today grimly watching the proceedings.
At the session, Mr. Gorbachev came out swinging. He turned on leaders of the Soyuz faction, accusing them of constantly seeking confrontation "for their narrow-minded purposes." He accused the co-chairmen of the bloc, Col. Viktor Alksnis and Yuri Blokhin, of "demagogic" efforts to trip him and his policies at every turn.
"You can take my statement as evidence that democracy is still in force, and nobody will usurp that democracy to achieve their own ends," Mr. Gorbachev declared to loud applause from liberal ranks in the Supreme Soviet. Those comments echoed to some extent the resignation speech last year by Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, who warned of the threat of a dictatorship from the right facing Mr. Gorbachev.
In the voting, Mr. Pavlov's request for additional powers was easily defeated in a procedural vote, and Parliament voted instead to request the President to study the proposal, insuring that it would die.
 
Pavlov Denies Conflict
 Mr. Pavlov, who sat through the debate grimly buried in paperwork, rose briefly to deny any conflict with the President and to declare his full agreement with the positions set out by Mr. Gorbachev.
Only one day earlier, however, he had repeated in a radio interview that he believed too many powers were concentrated in the President, saying, "I'm sorry, but one person can't substitute for the entire Government."
Mr. Gorbachev also emotionally defended his request for Western aid and his negotiations with leaders of nine republics on a new Union Treaty, both of which have been anathema to the right-wing.
"We need cooperation with the republics," Mr. Gorbachev said. "Those who say we should ignore the republics and other social-political forces have not understood what has happened recently."
He was especially forceful in defending his foreign policies, which lately have been focused on attracting new foreign assistance. "As long as I'm in office, I'll follow this foreign policy," he said. "We need it abroad, and we need it at home."
 
Defending the Center
 The right-wing challenge to Mr. Gorbachev was played out against the well-publicized American visit by Mr. Yeltsin, confirmed as the leader of liberal forces in his strong victory in the Russian federation's presidential elections last week.
The contrast underscored the task Mr. Gorbachev faces in defending his crumbling center against the increasingly antagonistic forces of left and right. After introducing "perestroika" in alliance with liberal reformers, Mr. Gorbachev shifted to the right last fall after losing faith in the radical reforms proposed by his liberal advisers, including Mr. Yavlinsky.
But after reaching a political stalemate and watching the economy deteriorate to dangerous levels, Mr. Gorbachev struck a truce with Mr. Yeltsin and eight other republican leaders in April. Since then, he has led intensive negotiations for a new union treaty in which the Kremlin would cede substantial authority to the republics, and has shown renewed interest in Mr. Yavlinsky's ideas.

HEADLINE: Scientists Encouraged By Two AIDS Vaccines

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FLORENCE, June 21

 BODY:
Scientists today reported surprisingly encouraging results from tests in the United States of a combination of two experimental AIDS vaccines in a small number of uninfected human volunteers.
The combination yielded the best immune responses recorded in vaccine experiments to date, the seventh international AIDS meeting was told, increasing hopes that a vaccine might be developed by the turn of the century. 
 As the meeting ended, the urgent need for a vaccine and improved treatment for AIDS was underscored by the head of the World Health Organization, Dr. Hiroshi Nakajima, who told the nearly 10,000 participants that AIDS had become "a public health threat of unprecedented magnitude."
 
Worldwide Epidemic
 The size of the worldwide epidemic and the impending social and economic consequences, particularly in Africa, "are truly awesome," Dr. Nakajima said. International and local partnerships "are vital if we are to prevail over a pandemic that threatens the stability, the socioeconomic development, and the very survival of whole communities and countries," he said.
The World Health Organization in Geneva, a co-sponsor of the AIDS meeting here, has estimated that 10 million adults and children have been infected and that the number will reach 40 million by the year 2000.
The vaccine findings were reported by Dr. Barney S. Graham of Vanderbilt University in Nashville, who said that the two AIDS vaccines were given months apart.
Ten healthy volunteers at low risk for AIDS and who had never been vaccinated against smallpox received the vaccines in the study carried out at Vanderbilt and four other medical schools in programs sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
 
Genetically Engineered Vaccine
 The first vaccine was made by genetic engineering techniques. The gene for a protein on the outer coat of the AIDS virus known as gp160 was put into live vaccinia virus, which was once used to vaccinate against smallpox. The vaccine was made by Bristol Myers-Squibb and used vaccinia virus.
Most recipients developed only weak immune responses, although they usually lasted for more than a year, Dr. Graham said. The immune responses were a measure of the antibodies developed reacting to the vaccine.
Dr. Graham credited experiments carried out by researchers at the University of Washington in Seattle for his team's decision to use a second vaccine as a booster dose.
The booster is a subunit vaccine of purified gp160 made by MicroGeneSys Inc. The volunteers were given the booster from 11 to 27 months after the first vaccine.
After receiving the vaccine with the booster dose, the volunteers showed strong enough immune responses to gp160 to be in the range that would be expected for an effective vaccine, Dr. Graham said.
Further research is needed before larger trials are undertaken.
The international AIDS meetings customarily close with a welcoming speech from the chairman of the next meeting. But the next chairman, Dr. Max Essex of Harvard, said he was "not hopeful" the meeting would be held in Boston as planned.
"There will be no conference in Boston unless all American travel and immigration restrictions against HIV-infected people are lifted by August 3," Dr. Essex said. The human immunodefiency virus, or HIV, causes AIDS.
The International AIDS Society, which chooses the sites for the meetings, the World Health Organization and the National Commission on AIDS have said they would support the Boston meeting if travel restrictions alone were lifted.
But the Gay Men's Health Crisis and Act-Up, an advocacy group for people with AIDS, have said their members would disrupt and shut down any conference that takes place if the immigration restrictions were not lifted as well, Dr. Essex said.
Dr. Giovanni Battista Rossi, the chairman of the meeting here, said the organizers were sending Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, a summary of the latest findings that "confirm the unanimously held opinion regarding the negligible nature of" the risk of transmitting the AIDS virus from infected travelers.
Dr. Paul Volberding, the president of the International AIDS Society, which is based in Germany, said the society would withdraw its endorsement of the meeting if the ban was not lifted by Aug. 3. The Bush Administration has said it would decide by then whether to lift the ban. He said the society would not endorse any other site as a substitute, but gave no explanation.

HEADLINE: VICTORIOUS REBEL SEES ERITREA VOTE

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ASMARA, Ethiopia, June 20

 BODY:
With a modest show of war weaponry and a parade of guerrillas at an outdoor stadium, the leader of Eritrea addressed the people today for the first time since his rebel group defeated the last Ethiopian Army outpost in the region four weeks ago.
Dressed in civilian clothes instead of the khaki garb of his fighters, Isaias Afewerki, the 46-year-old secretary general of the Eritrean People's Liberation Front, told the crowd that he would seek to legalize last month's military victory through a United Nations-sponsored referendum on independence from Ethiopia. He said the referendum, a basic goal of the Eritrean Front's separatist campaign, would take place within two years. 
 The vote, which is expected to favor independence by a wide margin, was expected earlier. But Mr. Isaias, flanked by Sudanese officials and a sole member of the new administration in Addis Ababa, said time was needed for the transition to independence. He also said it was necessary to promote stability in Ethioipa. The separation of Eritrea is strongly resisted in some influential sectors of Ethiopian society and could threaten the interim Government struggling to establish control in Addis Ababa.
Mr. Isaias has often said a stable Ethiopia is vital to the success of an independent Eritrean state. With its 600 miles of Red Sea coastline, an independent Eritrea would make Ethiopia a landlocked country.
In the last two years, Mr. Isaias has successfully courted American officials, and last month the United States endorsed Eritrean self-determination for the first time. The Eritreans claim that Eritrea, an Italian colony from the 1880's until World War II, was wrongly given to Emperor Haile Selassie in 1952. At first the region was part of a federated Ethiopia, but when Ethiopia annexed the region outright in 1962, the rebellion started. After 1977, it developed into a full-scale guerrilla war with the Soviet-backed Marxist Government of Mengistu Haile Mariam.
 
To Attend Ethiopia Conference
 To foster good relations with Addis Ababa, Mr. Isaias said he would attend a conference in Ethiopia on July 1 to form a provisional government there. The convening of the conference was part of the agreement with American officials in London last month, when the United States gave its blessing to the new administration of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front, a group based in neighboring Tigre province. The Tigreans entered a loose alliance with the Eritrean Front in the battle against the Mengistu Government.
The United States said economic aid for Ethiopia was contingent on including all Ethiopian ethnic groups in a provisional government and asked Mr. Isaias to attend the conference.
The Eritrean Front is not expected to join the provisional Government in Addis Ababa, but Mr. Isaias said in an interview this week that he also had no intention of announcing a formal provisional government in Eritrea until after the referendum.
"The E.P.L.F. is the government of the day," he said. "We are saying take it or leave it."
Mr. Isaias said that he was keeping his title of secretary general and that departments of the Eritrean Front would be reorganized a bit and function as national institutions, but would not be named ministries.
Asmara and the rest of Eritrea remain cut off with no working public international telephone or telex lines.

Where Interstate Means A War Along the Border

BYLINE: By DON TERRY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DAVENPORT, Iowa, June 18

 BODY:
To George Malito, Interstate 80 is not just a highway; it is an asphalt-covered conveyor belt bringing customers to the service station he operates here.
So when he heard about an attempt by Illinois to renumber part of the highway and thereby reroute some of the interstate's traffic through the Land of Lincoln, Mr. Malito was irate. 
 He wrote his Congressman and called every nearby hotel and restaurant he could think of to warn them about the threat coming from the other side of the Mississippi.
"What Illinois wants to do is to steal business from Iowa," he said the other day. "They just want to get some of our money."
For more than a year, Interstate 80 has been the source of a tug-of-war between Iowa and Illinois, a battle that even reached the United States Senate last week as members wrestled with provisions of the $123 billion Federal transportation bill.
At issue is a nondescript line of the east-west highway that cuts across the middle of Iowa, rolls past mile after mile of farmland and fast food signs as it approaches what is known as the Quad Cities, Davenport and Bettendorf in Iowa and Rock Island and Moline in Illinois. It then dips into Illinois and continues almost all the way to Chicago.
Interstate 280 is a short length of highway that quickly ducks below Rock Island and Moline before connecting again with I-80, which carries the bulk of the area's traffic.
Citing safety issues, Illinois proposes that I-280 be changed to I-80. A 30-mile stretch of I-80 in Iowa from about Davenport, east to the Mississippi River, would become I-74.
The effect would indeed be to rer oute more traffic through Illinois and, Mr. Malito and the Davenport Chamber of Commerce fear, away from Iowa businesses.
But Illinois officials say highway safety and the chance to save taxpayers $35 million in highway reconstruction -- not economic gain -- are the main reasons for the proposal.
The current problem, they say, is the winding and confusing convergence of interstates 80, 280 and 74 about 10 miles inside the Illinois border. The interchange has been the site of dozens of accidents and must be reconstructed at a cost of $35 million if the interstates are not renumbered and the traffic rerouted to avoid several sharp turnoffs, Illinois officials say.
Ken Schloemer, the chairman of the Illinois Quad Cities Chamber of Commerce coordinating committee, said, "We don't want to spend that tax money, when all we have to do is change the signs and save millions and millions of dollars."
But Ruth Shuck, the manager of a Davenport hotel, said she did not come all the way here from Memphis, Tenn., just to get thrown out of work. "For the life of me," she said, "I don't know why Illinois wants to meddle in Iowa's affairs."
But Mr. Schloemer contended: "We're not meddling in Iowa's affairs. The interchange is in Illinois and it's dangerous."
A spokesman for the Illinois Department of Transportation, Richard Adorjan, said some work on the interchange would have to be done no matter what happens to the road signs. But if the interstate is renumbered, he said, only about $2.5 million will have to be spent on improvements.
Iowans are not buying it. And right now, Iowa holds all the cards.
Under Federal rules, highway numbers affecting more than one state can only be changed when all affected states agree. So far, Iowa has said: "No. No. No."
Undaunted, Illinois tried an end run last week when one of its Senators, Alan J. Dixon, called for a measure that would have empowered the Secretary of Transportation to form a panel to decide the issue. The Senate also said no.
But Illinois may still have a plan or two just around the next bend.
"We're not discussing our plans," said Mr. Schloemer. "We're proceeding with other alternatives. You might say, Illinois has a history of not giving up easily. A great example of that is the Chicago Bulls."
The other day as the sun was setting over Davenport, weary travelers from West Virgina and Nebraska and other states filled the lobby of the Davenport Motel 6. The desk clerk, Kenny Sederstrom, said area businesses would not be the only ones to suffer if the highway is renumbered.
"I think," he said, "that changing the numbers would create one hell of a lot of problems for Rand McNally.'

HEADLINE: Health Jobs Defy Recession in New York

BYLINE: By RICHARD LEVINE

 BODY:
New York's health-care industry is one of the few areas of growth in the city's faltering economy, providing thousands of new jobs, especially for immigrants and members of minorities.
But the growth has provided little stimulus to the economy over all, and the health-care jobs often offer workers only a tenuous economic foothold. 
 Pausing the other day as her colleagues marched to protest the lack of a new labor contract, Alta Gracia, a home health-care worker from Brooklyn, measured her progress in the decade since she arrived from the Dominican Republic.
 
Rapid Growth in Jobs
 She likes her job, most recently caring for an elderly woman who has diabetes and is confined to a wheelchair. She does not like the pay, about $11,000 a year. But any day now, Ms. Gracia, a single parent, will learn whether she has passed a state exam and can take the next step, into nursing and toward the middle class.
With an increase of 10,000 jobs in 1990 alone, New York City now has more than a quarter of a million private health-care jobs, a 33 percent rise from 1980. One of every 12 private jobs in the city is in health care, which has become New York's second-largest private industry after business services.
The proliferation of jobs at New York hospitals and clinics and the rapid growth of home care have partially offset the huge job losses the city has suffered in other areas in the last few years. The growth, coinciding with a surge in immigration to the city, has also recast traditional patterns of ethnic succession. There are home health-care workers from the Caribbean and South and Central America, and nurses from the Philippines and Ireland. Respiratory, X-ray and other technicians have arrived from India, Bangladesh and the Soviet Union.
Labor shortages still exist in many technical fields, and despite a basic union contract under which the most experienced nurses can earn $60,000 or more a year, they are still in demand.
But some economists and public-health experts regard the surge in health-care jobs warily.
Private hospitals are under increasing cost pressures and have already trimmed a few thousand jobs from their payrolls, and this week the city's Health and Hospital Corporation sent out 2,700 layoff notices covering virtually every type of position except nurses.
And far from strengthening New York City's position in research or advanced medicine -- and drawing new money to the city -- much of the health-care boom is seen by experts as the city's attempt to cope with drug abuse, AIDS, a rising birth rate and an aging population. These costly efforts are increasing the strain on city and state budgets and absorbing health-insurance premiums of residents and businesses.
"This employment is really a double-edged sword," said Kenneth E. Thorpe, associate professor at the University of North Carolina School of Public Health. "It's true it's a growth area, but if it wasn't a growth area, all that money wouldn't have to be spent, or could be spent on something else."
Although overshadowed by Wall Street and business and professional services, the city's health-care industry accounted for 60,000 new jobs in the 1980's, one in four created during that prosperous decade, according to the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. The number of workers at the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation, who are counted separately as public employees, reached 45,000, a gain of about a 25 percent, during the same time.
The number of private home-care workers -- narrowly defined by the labor statistics bureau as people who provide limited medical care under a doctor's supervision -- soared in the 1980's, to about 17,000 from 2,400. However, the hospital workers' union puts the total of home-care workers far higher, at about 70,000.
Jobs at drug, alcohol and other rehabilitation and outpatient clinics rose to 10,000 from 8,500. Jobs at homes for the aged and the handicapped and other residential-care centers rose to 18,000 from 10,000. Jobs in drug manufacturing, counted separately by Federal officials, increased to 8,800 from 8,300 in New York City between 1979 and 1987, a trend even more pronounced in New Jersey, where many large drug makers are located.
In recent years, said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, "health care has played a predominate role in whatever growth there has been in New York City's service industry."
But a report in October by the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York found that in 1988 and 1989, the increase in the number of physicians, laboratory technicians and other highly skilled professionals -- which was 6 percent nationally and 4 percent in New York State -- was just 1.7 percent in New York City.
"It appears that employment has been growing very rapidly in health care, but the most rapid growth is in the lower end," said Rae D. Rosen, the organization's vice president and senior economist.
"If that's where your growth is coming from, you won't get the multiplier effect," she added, referring to the progression in which salaries are spent and transformed into other salaries that are spent again, increasing their impact throughout the economy.
Because lower-paying jobs in health care and social services, which are largely health related, are increasing while new jobs in more lucrative fields such as law, accounting and engineering are growing scarcer, the result is a downward shift in New York's service economy. In the last three years, there have been 50,000 new service jobs created in the city, 80 percent of which were in health care, education or social services.
And despite the job growth, the city has been slipping in the share of grants and research money it attracts. Twenty years ago, the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York has reported, New York City captured 10 percent of the research funds from the National Institutes of Health, nearly a third more than second-place Boston. By 1987, Boston had moved ahead of New York.
Nonetheless, Dennis Rivera, president of Local 1199 of the Drug, Hospital and Health Care Employees Union -- which has grown to 100,000 members, from 65,000 in 1973 -- noted that hospitals are among the largest employers in some boroughs and are a source of stability in some of the city's poorest neighborhoods.
The union negotiated a contract for registered nurses in 1989 that has increased pay and improved recruiting, easing workloads and schedules.
Carol Johnson, a registered nurse in the medical-surgical department at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan, said she was considering leaving nursing a few years ago. Now, she said, "working conditions have tremendously improved."
A union-management training program has helped thousands of health-care workers, including dieticians, maintenance and clerical workers and nurses' aides, move into jobs as nurses, therapists and pharmacists, advancing their careers and helping to fill shortages in the industry.
But salaries for home-care workers are typically $9,000 to $11,000, and the workers have been without a contract for almost a year. Even with a better contract, advancement will be difficult for these workers, many of whom speak limited English and have little training. Should Ms. Gracia, who was a practical nurse in the Dominican Republic, make the transition in New York, she would be an exception, union officials say.

HEADLINE: Yeltsin Gives His Regards To Wall Street (Soberly)

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

 BODY:
On his last day in America, Boris N. Yeltsin addressed the issue of hooliganism head-on.
Although he indulged a bit too much in Jack Daniel's and jackanapery on his last visit to the United States in 1989, leaving an impression of rowdiness, the new President of the Russian republic defended both his maturity and morality before an audience of students and guests at New York University yesterday. 
 "At the National Press Club in Washington, they mentioned that I sometimes spoke about myself as a mischievous person, something of a hooligan," he said in Russian, acknowledging that his remarks might be "quite unexpected or surprising."
"They should have gone a bit further and pointed out that, of course, when one is young, when you're a student, that's normal," he said. "You would not expect much more of that in me now."
Mr. Yeltsin, who clearly seemed sensitive about the issue of his image in America, also recounted a reporter's question about his morality. "They also asked me about my moral perspective," he said, "and what I said to that is that I've been married for 35 years and I've spent these 35 years with my wife and no one else."
Mr. Yeltsin had said at the Press Club event in Washington on Thursday that although he did not "have a real faith in God" and "although a lot of people have poured a great deal of slime on me, I still think of myself as a morally pure person."
Yesterday, he followed that up with praise of the Gospels, saying they were the "foundation of human morality."
Mr. Yeltsin is an impulsive and sentient politician, and at home that is part of his great appeal to the voters who gave him a resounding victory last week as the first popularly elected President of Russia.
 
Correcting Past Impressions
 But, on his four-day trip to Washington and New York, he wanted to convey a brisk, sober and businesslike demeanor, as a way of correcting any exaggerated impressions of his freewheeling style.
With symbols and substance, he wanted to show the skeptics -- including Mr. Bush and his advisers, who considered Mr. Yeltsin's behavior on his last trip petulant and dogmatic -- that he had grown into his role as a major force in Soviet politics.
Mr. Bush and his national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, came away more impressed with Mr. Yeltsin this time around.
Although Mr. Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle elaborately praised President Mikhail S. Gorbachev as a way of making it clear that his is the primary relationship on which they will focus, the President did put in a good word for Mr. Yeltsin when he talked to Mr. Gorbachev on the phone yesterday.
When Mr. Gorbachev called, Mr. Bush urged him to work with Mr. Yeltsin on political and economic reforms. In a 40-minute conversation, Mr. Bush also underscored the need to conclude a treaty reducing long-range nuclear weapons to pave the way for a United States-Soviet summit meeting this summer.
With the New York University students, Mr. Yeltsin struck an avuncular tone, telling them that "the college years are the most wonderful time in our lives, the feeling that your entire life is still ahead of you."
"Most important is the feeling of creativity, the freedom from prejudice or mental stereotypes, and the quest for the new," he said.
Outside the university's Vanderbilt Hall, where Mr. Yeltsin spoke, a group of demonstrators held signs that read, "Yeltsin: Wall Street Tool" and "Bush, Wall Street and Yeltsin Aim: Destroy Socialism, Bring In Capitalism, Poverty and Racism."
Mr. Yeltsin, who appeared buoyant about the reception he has gotten in America, was not deterred in his celebration of capitalism. He went on to spend the afternoon in New York meeting with Federal Reserve Bank leaders and business executives, trying to build confidence in investment possibilities in the Soviet Union.
At the university, he spoke of a vision in which most of the Northern Hemisphere would be led by similar political and economic principles.
"For the first time in our meeting with President Bush," he said of his hour-and-40-minute Oval Office talk with Mr. Bush on Thursday, "we have reached an understanding that, from now on, the United States will maintain direct contacts not only with the single Government of the Soviet Union" but also with the republics.
Administration officials said Mr. Yeltsin seemed to be overdramatizing the "understanding." They said the Administration has been reaching out to the individual Soviet republics for the last six months.
Also, Administration officials said the United States Embassy in Moscow has been expanding its contacts with the individual republics to follow the development in economic and political reform.
Before going to lunch at The New York Times, and then on to Wall Street, Mr. Yeltsin made a brief stop in the garment district to show that he had not lost interest in the fate of the working class.
He stopped at 530 Seventh Avenue and toured the offices of "Party Formals," the makers of the evening gowns that were worn by contestants in the 1991 Miss America contest.
Wearing an International Ladies Garment Workers Union hat, Mr. Yeltsin flipped through the pink satin strapless dresses, the jeweled jackets and the plaid sequined gowns.
Trying out a sewing machine while visiting with a dozen women who make patterns for $8 an hour, Mr. Yeltsin eyed a $500 sequined jacket and asked, "Is this for actors?"
No, he was told, it was not a costume, but a jacket that a typical woman might wear on an evening out.
Afterward, Mr. Yeltsin went to Wall Street for two meetings and dinner with officials of the Federal Reserve Board of New York and various corporate officials. Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, flew in from Washington to attend the meetings and dinner.
The sessions drew such prominent financiers as Robert E. Rubin, co-chairman of the Goldman Sachs investment house. The visit was viewed primarily as a chance to discuss a number of issues that might affect American investment in the Soviet Union.
"Mr. Yeltsin is focusing more on direct investment than aid and that's why he seems interested in meeting American executives," said Robert D. Hormats, a vice president of Goldman Sachs.

HEADLINE: Thomas I. Emerson, 83, Scholar Who Molded Civil Liberties Law

BYLINE: By GLENN FOWLER

 BODY:
Thomas I. Emerson, a legal theorist who was a major architect of civil liberties laws, died on Wednesday at the Yale Health Services Center in New Haven. He was 83 years old and lived North Haven, Conn.
He died of complications from a stroke, said Martha Matzke, a spokeswoman for Yale. 
 Professor Emerson, who taught at the Yale Law School for three decades, was a scholar whose career involved him in many of the great societal and political issues of the century.
As a young lawyer in 1931, fresh out of Yale, he served on the defense team that successfully appealed the convictions of the "Scottsboro boys," nine black Alabama teen-agers sentenced to death after they were convicted of raping two white women. The case came to be regarded as the beginning of the civil rights era.
 
Foreshadowed Roe v. Wade
 In 1965, Professor Emerson successfully argued Griswold v. Connecticut before the United States Supreme Court, which overturned a state law banning the sale of contraceptives. The ruling established a right to privacy and foreshadowed the Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion.
Professor Emerson was born in Passaic, N.J., and was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Yale before going on to its law school and becoming editor in chief of The Yale Law Journal.
He went to Washington with President Roosevelt's New Deal in 1933 and worked in the National Recovery Administration, on the National Labor Relations Board, on the Social Security Board and in the Attorney General's office.
In World War II he was deputy administrator for enforcement of the Office of Price Administration, general counsel for the Office of Economic Stabilization and general counsel of the Office of War Mobilization and Reconversion.
 
Honored for Civil Liberties Work
 He was named a professor of law at Yale in 1946 and in 1955 became the Lines Professor of Law. He retired in 1976. He was the author of several books, notably "The System of Freedom of Expression," published in 1970. It was regarded as a major treatise on free speech.
Professor Emerson was president of the National Lawyers Guild in 1950 and 1951 and was the first recipient of the American Civil Liberties Union Medal of Liberty for his lifetime service in defense of civil liberties.
He is survived by his wife, the former Ruth Calvin; a daughter, Joan, of San Francisco; two sons, Robert, of Los Angeles, and Dr. Luther Emerson 3d of Brattleboro, Vt., and three brothers, Luther Jr., of Demarest, N.J., James, of Lyons, Colo., and Paul, of Somerville, N.J.

HEADLINE: BAKER URGES END TO YUGOSLAV RIFT

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, June 21

 BODY:
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d made a highly unusual attempt today to persuade the feuding leaders of Yugoslavia's six republics not to let their country break up into separate states, but said his appeal got nowhere and that Yugoslavia could be headed for "disintegration."
Mr. Baker was visiting Yugoslavia for the first time, and was not expected to make much headway in defusing a welter of old nationalist feuds. Nonetheless, he sounded something of an international alarm.
 
Fear of Broad Consequences
 After individual meetings with the leaders of the six republics, Mr. Baker said he had heard nothing to reduce his fears that this nation could break up in violence, fomenting the kind of instability in the Balkan region that helped touch off World War I. 
 "We came to Yugoslavia because of our concern about the crisis and about the dangers of a disintegration of this country," Mr. Baker said. "Instability and breakup of Yugoslavia, we think, could have some very tragic consequences, not only here but more broadly in Europe. We are obviously not alone in having these concerns."
Mr. Baker continued: "The concerns that we came to Yugoslavia with have not been allayed by the meetings we had today. We think that the situation is very serious. We worry frankly about history repeating itself. Frankly, we don't want to see that and I don't think anyone in the international community wants to see that."
He told the Presidents of the republics of Slovenia and Croatia, who are planning to announce some form of independence in the next few days, that the United States and its European allies would not recognize them if they were to unilaterally break away from Yugoslavia and that they should not expect any economic assistance.
 
Withholding U.S. Recognition
 Mr. Baker told the President of Serbia, Yugoslavia's biggest and most populous republic and the one least willing to countenance any breakup of the 72-year-old country, that he should consider granting limited autonomy to republics within a looser federation in an effort to satisfy the different Yugoslav ethnic groups.
Speaking of the pending announcement of Slovenia's independence, which could come as early as next week, Mr. Baker said, "It would not be the policy of the United States to recognize that declaration because we want to see this problem solved through negotiations and through dialogue."
He said that while the United States wanted to see Yugoslavia's territorial integrity preserved, it would welcome any federal restructuring accepted by the republics.
American diplomats here said that since all the republics contain large minorities of people who identify culturally and linguistically with other republics, some form of federal arrangement would be preferable to separation.
"Everyone is interested in finding a way through dialogue to craft a new basis for unity of Yugoslavia and to find a way to see the devolution of additional authority and responsibility and sovereignty to the republics of Yugoslavia," Mr. Baker said.
President Ante Markovic, who is trying to hold his country together, met with Mr. Baker immediately after the Secretary arrived. After their meeting, Mr. Markovic made a speech to Parliament, warning that the federal army would "take measures" to prevent unilateral action by any republic to change the borders of Yugoslavia.
 
Republics Ignore Appeals
 The Secretary spent the afternoon holding separate 30-minute sessions with the Presidents of the six republics. But they ignored Mr. Baker's appeals, just as they have those from the Soviet Union and the European Community.
When the President of Slovenia, Milan Kucan, seated next to Mr. Baker, was asked what he wanted to hear from the Secretary of State, he answered, "That all the nations of Yugoslavia may live as they wish."
How would Slovenia like to live? he was asked.
"The same way as other European nations," he answered. "As an independent nation which, out of its own will, has ties with other nations."
On the other end of the issue, the Serbian President, Slobodan Milosevic, told Mr. Baker that his republic was not interested in seeing the federal Government of Yugoslavia cede any serious powers to the republics.
 
'Limit to Our Flexibility'
 "Our policy is to preserve the integrity of our country in order to realize democratic changes within the country, but not to liquidate the country as a state," Mr. Milosevic said. "Flexibility has some limits."
The Federal Government must have "some minimal function without which Yugoslavia cannot be a country," he said. "It means defense, foreign affairs, human-rights protection, national rights protection and one market with one central bank."
The independent Yugoslav daily newspaper Borba said on Thursday that Mr. Baker "is arriving too late." Logical argument simply will not work at this stage, when ethnic and nationalist passions suppressed by 45 years of Communist rule are exploding to the surface, the paper said.
The republics are split three ways on the question of devolution. Slovenia and Croatia, the two most Westernized republics with the highest per-capita wealth, want to move ahead quickly with independence, but say they are prepared to take part in some loose federation with the other Yugoslav republics. Slovenia has already set up its own border posts and is planning to issue its own currency.
The largest republic, Serbia, which has traditionally dominated Yugoslav politics, and Montenegro, the smallest, want to preserve the status quo. Bosnia and Macedonia, republics created by the Communists after World War II, are pushing a compromise plan under which republics would be given partial sovereignty but the central Government would retain federal functions.
Mr. Baker flies on Saturday to Albania, which is emerging from decades of isolation and Communist dictatorship. A new coalition Government took over in Tirana this month.

HEADLINE: The Yeltsin Touch

 BODY:
On his visit to America this week, Boris Yeltsin has shown himself to be, in the very best sense of the word, a pol -- something to hearten Americans watching soberly as the Soviet people cross the great political and economic divide.
The Russian republic's president-elect talked easily with professional politicians, journalists and others, warmly complimenting the American system. He demonstrated wit, tenacity and a comfortable willingness to defer to his advisers on detail. He showed that he knows how to deal deftly with symbols, when he donned a cowboy hat and posed for photographers. 
 And, with one sentence, he demonstrated how to stand by President Mikhail Gorbachev even while reaffirming his own authority in the Russian republic: "While Gorbachev stands for reform, while Gorbachev stands for democratic change, while Gorbachev stands for the independence of the republics, Yeltsin stands for Gorbachev."
To Americans who worry that the new Soviet politics is all posturing and sloganeering without much democratic give-and-take between leaders and constituents, Mr. Yeltsin's performance is a revelation. The Soviet Union is going to need a lot more such political dexterity to emerge transformed from its current travail.
The challenges that the Soviet people confront would test the most skillful and dedicated of politicians. Lincoln had to bind up the wounds of secession. F.D.R. had to lead Americans out of the deprivation and despair of the Great Depression. Churchill and de Gaulle had to preside over the dissolution of empire. Today's Soviet leaders confront all these problems and more: They have to cope with the collapse of an entire political and economic system.
For generations, politics in the Soviet Union meant Byzantine maneuvering and public manipulation. The popular cynicism and distrust left behind makes leadership now even harder. Competitive elections are essential to allay the distrust, and renew the political elite. Otherwise an entrenched old guard will block economic and political reform.
That danger was apparent this week when Mr. Gorbachev, responding to the Communist Party's rout in Russia's election, showed signs of accelerating the move to markets. A sizable group of old-guard deputies in the Supreme Soviet tried to stymie him by enhancing the authority of Government ministries at his expense, but Mr. Gorbachev fended off a vote on the power grab with a scathing counterattack.
Soviet government won't work without the masterful inside politics practiced by Mikhail Gorbachev. But for the Government to build trust with the Soviet people requires a popular political touch like that demonstrated by Boris Yeltsin. The Soviet Union will need both sources of strength to survive the strain of difficult decisions still to come.

HEADLINE: How Banks Can Help Children

BYLINE: By Jill M. Considine and Linda Tarr-Whelan; Jill M. Considine, managing director of American Express Bank, was State Superintendent of Banks. Linda Tarr-Whelan is president of the Center for Policy Alternatives.

 BODY:
Bringing up children is a responsibility shared by parents and the community. Still, while 90,000 children under 3 years of age need day care in New York City, only 6,100 licensed slots are available. And local and state government certainly cannot afford to foot all the capital costs of building and starting new child-care centers.
But no one should give up hope. One solution is to find financing partners. Banks are more than a resource. They have expertise in investing in child care and they also have incentive. In New York, local banks are required by Federal and state Community Reinvestment Acts to meet the credit needs of all segments of their communities. Nationally, the Federal law has encouraged banks to commit more than $7.5 billion in loans to poor communities. 
 Last fall, with help from the Center for Policy Alternatives, the New York Banking Department and Department of Economic Development invited bankers to explore ways to invest in child care. Banks were asked to identify the risks, including cash flow restrictions and profitability, and then to cooperate with government and community groups to reduce those risks. As they have done so successfully for low- and moderate-income housing, banks can form lending consortiums and work with intermediaries to lessen risks on individual loans and spread the costs associated with nontraditional lending.
In New York, the Wyoming County Bank has already invested in a day-care center in Attica. Based on that success, the bank and the state Urban Development Corporation have each committed $132,000 in Batavia to build and equip a center that will serve some 44 children.
In New York City, two nonprofit groups, the Local Initiatives Support Corporation and Child Care Inc., are working on day-care projects that will rely heavily on bank financing.
New York State, a leader in child-care and economic development programs, provides management assistance, loan guarantees, direct loans and equity grants. Even so, its efforts can't keep up with the demand for child care. The programs can have a much greater impact if private money is also invested.
To encourage additional financing, the New York Banking Department notified its state-chartered institutions that it will consider child-care lending in its assessment of bank performance under the Community Reinvestment Act. Banks are given ratings from "substantial noncompliance" to "outstanding," based on efforts to meet the credit needs of their communities. We hope this clear sign promotes investment in child care and other emerging social needs, and we urge Federal regulators and other states to follow New York's example.
Financing child-care services offers banks the chance to serve their communities with safe and profitable loans. It also offers less affluent entrepreneurs in cities and rural areas the funds to start small businesses, which provide jobs. But the chief beneficiaries would be working parents and single mothers who badly need safe, affordable places to leave their children.

HEADLINE: A Small Town in the Grand Style

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES; WILLIAM GRIMES is an editor of The New York Times Magazine.

 BODY:
LIKE all great ideas, the Midwest is deceptively simple -- plain, plausible and, ultimately, elusive. Geographically, it's hard to pin down, a vast, amorphous territory somewhere west of the Alleghenies, east of the Rockies, south of Canada and north of the South. As a metaphor, it's ambiguous. Tradition assigns the Midwest a glorious role: the Heartland, Middle America (repository for all the core values), the Nation's Breadbasket. But for those who see it as nothing more than the endless expanse that makes LAX to JFK a six-hour proposition, it's America with the points of difference shaved smooth, sort of like Johnny Carson's Nebraska non-accent.
We need an Institute of Midwestern Studies to sort these matters out. In the meantime, the rule of thumb is this: drive inland, and after a while the scenery flattens out, the people get friendlier and funnier, and Paul Harvey dominates the radio. Behold the Midwest, where the doughnut and pie reign supreme. 
 It is a land of small towns. Other regions have them, but the Midwest perfected the form, laid down the rules for the kind of place that Americans shed tears over every Christmas when "It's a Wonderful Life" comes on. Needless to say, the 20th century has brought blight. Pull off the Interstate, and the road into Centerville, U.S.A., administers a pistol-whipping to the senses. Out the side window, a nightmare unfolds: Jiffy Lube, Mr. Tire, Tae Kwan Do Academy, Great Wall of China Cantonese/American Restaurant, Noble Roman Pizza, Jay-Bee's Video/Tanning Salon. By comparison, the aging Dairy Queen at the edge of town acquires a certain dignity.
On the other side of the Welcome to Centerville sign ("A City on the Move"), things take a sharp turn for the better. Improbably large houses appear, plopped down on expansive lawns. Home to the local gentry, surely. Serious-looking trees arch over neat residential streets -- streets lined with more of those whopping houses and park-size lawns. A flash of insight: ordinary people live in those houses.
Everywhere, there's a lot of room. And everything looks solid. The courthouse, the post office, the library. The streets are laid out on a grid. Their names tend to be State, Walnut, Lincoln and Monroe. Main Street is a no-nonsense affair, a stern rebuke to the suspect values of the commercial strip leading into town. It has a hardware store, a drugstore, a department store, a gift shop and a couple of cafes, strong on the basics. The local manner is affable but not fulsome; the sense of humor is rooted in a keen sense of the absurd, as though settling this far from an ocean amounts to a huge, richly enjoyable joke. Welcome to Centerville. Sinclair Lewis hated it. Today, it's looking pretty good.
Consider Marshall, Mich., population 6,900 -- "Town of Hospitality." Not all that many people do. In the south-central part of the state, about midway between Detroit and Chicago, it plays its strongest card on billboards along I-94: "Home of Schuler's Restaurant." This is a modest pitch, for the traveler who pulls off the highway gets a bonus: a gem of a town that one architectural historian has called "a textbook of 19th-century and early 20th-century American small-town architecture." This month, the Department of the Interior will designate a large chunk of Marshall, including about 800 structures, a National Historic Landmark District.
On its best blocks, Marshall makes the Midwest seem like the sweetest place on earth. The wide streets are lined with heroic tulip, maple and pine trees, home to svelte-looking black squirrels. Plush stretches of green turf release a pleasant lawny fragrance, and seem to soak up sound like soft acoustic tiles, turning the mean snarl of the lawn mower into a somnolent drone. Overhead, suspiciously on cue, birds twitter, warble and chirp.
Marshall is defined by its houses. Set well back from the sidewalk, with plenty of elbow room on either side, they evoke a freer, ampler way of life, when families were large, when front porches could accommodate multitudes and interiors offered the mysteries of nooks and crannies. Architecturally, Marshall cast its net wide. Its houses have towers, gables, gothic windows, front, side and rear porches, widow's walks, campaniles, dentellation, bargeboards, tracery, lacy woodwork trim, porticoes, columns, additions, subtractions and God knows what else.
The writer John Bellairs found that his hometown worked perfectly as a setting for his teen mysteries. "Even the ordinary white-frame houses had things that made them seem different -- a stained-glass window or a bouquet of iron flowers on top of a cupola," the narrator marveled in "The House With a Clock in Its Walls." "And so many of the houses seemed to be hiding secrets."
The white-frame houses are dwindling in number. Marshall's homeowners have returned to the rich, extroverted palette of the 19th century, correcting the historical mistake of a century ago, when America decided to imitate New England and paint its houses chalk white. Marshall houses are cream-colored with chocolate trim, canary yellow with black shutters. They're blue-gray and royal blue, teal and white, pink and red. Pleasing in itself, color causes the architectural details to pop out in sharp relief. According to John J. Collins, former head of the Marshall Historical Society, a visiting town official from Biloxi, Miss., recently requested a copy of Marshall's color ordinance. "I told her, we don't have one," he said. "All we have is good taste and peer pressure."
Peer pressure opens a handful of houses for public view every September, when Marshall holds its annual historic house tour, a festival of snooping that draws some 10,000 visitors. The tour began innocently enough in the 1950's, when women members of a local church began throwing open their kitchens, newly stocked with postwar wonder appliances, for inspection and socializing. Before long, the kitchen tour had evolved into a wildly popular house tour, which the Marshall Historical Society took over in 1967.
More than half of Marshall's buildings date from the 19th century, most of them from 1850 to 1870. The architectural styles neatly coincide with the town's three economic eras. A sprinkling of Greek Revival buildings, grandiose classical blockbusters with columned porticoes, reflect the heady days when Marshall expected to be named the capital of Michigan. A fickle legislature decreed otherwise. In 1847 Marshall, the fifth-largest town in the state, lost out to Lansing, which had only eight registered voters at the time. The area of town known as Capitol Hill serves as a reminder of dashed hopes, most visibly the "Governor's Mansion" at 612 South Marshall Avenue, a noble effort that faces the intended site for the state house, now a fairground.
A SECOND era of splendor began with the arrival of the Michigan Central Railroad in 1844. A 30-year building boom ensued, leaving the town with a legacy of Italianate and Gothic Revival homes. One of the most impressive is 603 North Kalamazoo Avenue. Built in 1869, it is a stately red-brick Italianate pile surrounded by towering Norwegian spruces and miniature gardens. Its most famous resident was the writer William Wallace Cook, who, under various pseudonyms, and with the aid of a story-generating system he called Plotto, cranked out dime novels featuring Buffalo Bill, Deadeye Dick, Frank Merriwether and Nick Carter.
A worthy rival to the Cook house is the J. Cronin Jr. house at 407 North Madison Street, the inspiration for John Bellairs's house with a clock in its walls. An upbeat version of the Addams Family residence, it's an idiosyncratic white-brick Italian villa, built in 1873, with a 60-foot mansard roof tower and an observatory.
Plump and prosperous, Marshall suffered a blow when the Michigan Central decided to move its yards to nearby Jackson in 1874. With its largest employer gone, Marsall showed old-fashioned enterprise and developed into a center for the manufacture of patent medicines, a lucrative industry that died after the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act in 1906. The era lives on in Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets (now made near Chicago), and a handful of houses in the grab-bag Queen Anne style -- Victorian confections with tall, narrow windows, steeply pitched roofs, and a generous assortment of peaks and turrets and towers.
The most famous building in Marshall reflects no style known to man. It is the Honolulu House, at 107 North Kalamazoo Avenue, a tropical fantasy painted in ivory, red and three shades of green -- the architectural equivalent of a four-rum cocktail served in a coconut. Now a museum, the house was built in 1860 for Abner Pratt, a former United States consul to the Sandwich Islands. To re-create a bit of the South Pacific right in Marshall, Mr. Pratt ordered up a grand two-story wood-faced structure with an enormous raised veranda and a pagoda-topped central tower. Inside, an ornate free-standing staircase of imported teak, ebony and mahogany rises to the central tower, and murals depicting tropical plants and animals decorate some of the walls and ceilings. The Honolulu House makes a purely American statement. Unself-conscious and exuberant, it's the product of money and whim.
The Honolulu House, and much of the rest of historic Marshall, owes its survival to a benevolent bully named Harold C. Brooks, the town's richest, and therefore leading, citizen. The family fortune, based on rupture appliances ("Brooks Supports the World -- And Will Never Let It Down"), left Mr. Brooks time and money enough to rearrange the town to his liking.
BEGINNING in the early 1920's, he would buy up fine old houses languishing on the market and simply hold them until a buyer came along. He maintained the trees in the town's parks. When Mr. Brooks got wind of outsiders offering to buy old walnut trees, he would approach their owners and offer the same money to keep the trees in place. He didn't care for the post office, so he paid to have it torn down and rebuilt his way. In 1930, he endowed the town's traffic circle with a marble Grecian fountain, a reproduction of the Temple of Love at Versailles -- minus the nude Aphrodite. Mr. Brooks knew where to draw the line.
The statueless fountain has a commanding view of Marshall's main street, Michigan Avenue, a broad thoroughfare with two hardware stores, the grand Brooks post office, several dentists' offices, Darling and Daughter variety store, several antiques and gift shops, a Rexall drug store, the Brooks rupture-appliance business (now a mail-order operation) and the American Museum of Magic. The museum is a private operation run by Bob Lund, a lifelong collector of magic memorabilia, who maintains a library of about 12,000 volumes. The museum is a mandatory visit for the magicians who in August converge on Colon, about a 40-minute drive to the southwest, hometown of the renowned Harry Blackstone and headquarters of Abbott's Magic Company, the country's main producer of commercial magic supplies.
Marshall's main street also offers three cafes that make convenient stops -- Ken's, the Dugout and the Coffee Pot, where my wife and I achieved a lunch bill of $4.06 for a superior meatloaf sandwich, a cheeseburger, competition-worthy French fries and two iced teas.
The serious eating inevitably takes place at the famous Schuler's, a family-run enterprise for four generations. The menu sticks to basic American fare with an inspired digression here and there, and one oddball offering: New Zealand orange roughy, a fish that's probably less surprised to find itself broiled on a plate than it is to be in Marshall, Mich. In truth, despite the Lake Superior whitefish, meat is king at Schuler's: roast rib eye of pork with ginger root glaze and onion marmalade; Indiana duckling with a merlot cherry glaze, and the splurge entree, roast prime rib of beef, slowly roasted on rock salt. Seconds of prime rib are on the house. The wine list, in addition to a reasonable spread of California and French wines, offers six Michigan wines (mostly white, surprisingly good), from vineyards that begin about 75 miles to the west.
Here in the nation's midriff, a calorically ambitious meal still counts for something. The region was built on wheat and meat, cattle and corn, so it's a kind of treason to ask for ascoop of cottage cheese on lettuce. Besides, the frank and friendly invitation to stop in Marshall and dine at Schuler's reflects an earthy sense of priorities. Eat first, look at the houses later.
Marshall looks in the mirror and likes what it sees. It is an amiably self-promoting kind of place, keen on historical markers (44 in all) and lists of firsts, bests and biggests. The ever-vigilant historical society prints not only a 103-house "Walking Tour of Historic Marshall" pamphlet (free at the Chamber of Commerce or the National House Inn), but also a detailed guide to the town cemetery and a self-propelled tour of notable trees.
This small-town pride is a genteel descendant of the boosterism that Sinclair Lewis savaged in "Main Street" and "Babbitt." The brash marketing reflected the profound insecurity of citizens who had left the civilized East and, in a desperate roll of the dice, gambled on greatness. In virtually every case, they settled for something better. When Marshall lost the race for state capital, it began life in earnest. The dream faded, but the town flourished. And there are hundreds more like it all over the Midwest.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
Summer Hotel Deals: Good Buys Abound

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE

 BODY:
THE recession's toll on the travel industry is producing something that you might not believe possible: a brand-name New York hotel room in the range of $100 before taxes. Across the country, too, big-city hotels are posting offers -- $49, $69, $89 -- in line with motel prices.
Low occupancy rates for the year to the end of April -- 57.5 percent against the industry's general break-even point of 65 percent -- mean "it's going to be a long summer" for the industry, in the words of Mark Lomano, of Smith Travel Research of Gallatin, Tenn. But the empty rooms mean travelers can get a really good buy if they focus on the trends. If your vacation plans are still amendable, consider these facts. 
 First, with some phone checking, you can probably stay in a good hotel, complete with health club, restaurants and all sorts of extras, in a popular tourist city with attractions at your doorstep, for something near the price you might pay for a motel outside the city.
Mr. Lomano said that the highest-priced hotels were not doing so badly, but that hotels in the next rank, Hyatt, Marriott, Sheraton and the like, were badly hurt by the sharp decline in leisure travel. These, no surprise, are the chains advertising big discounts.
Second, resorts are hurting. If you want to try a resort you once thought out of reach, call about weekday reservations, when business is normally slower.
Conversely, for a hotel with big convention business, you should ask about weekend rates, when conventioneers have seized briefcases and fled, probably to a resort. Be sure to ask the hotel what constitutes a weekend: Friday and Saturday nights, yes, and sometimes Thursday or Sunday or both.
Third, Mr. Lomano does not believe that even the big discounts advertised now will bring business back to desired levels, so there are probably deeper cuts coming. This means that if you make a reservation, keep an eye on what the competition is doing and call back to ask for a bigger room or a lower rate.
 
The Major Chains
 Here are some hotel offers in the category where good deals are likely to be found. Each of the chains says that a member hotel joining in a program must set aside 10 percent of its rooms for sale at these special prices. This means you are more likely to get the advertised rate the earlier you make a reservation. Certain dates may be exempted.
About 90 Hyatts of the 110 in the United States and Canada are offering rates of $69, $89 and $109 for a room, depending on the city, for each night of a stay that includes a Friday or a Saturday night, or just for a Friday or Saturday night. The special rates, in effect until Sept. 2, apply to the hotels in the chain and two of its resorts, the Scottsdale Hyatt Regency, where the rate is $109, and the Grand Champions in Indian Wells, Calif., where the rate is $89. At both Hyatts in Denver, for another example, the rate is $69 and at the Grand Hyatt in New York City, $109. None of these rates include taxes, which should be asked about in all cases. In New York, they are high: 8.25 percent sales tax, 6 percent city occupancy tax, 5 percent state occupancy tax if the room costs $100 a night or more and a $2 city tax for rooms over $40, bringing a $109 room to $130, still an amazing buy in New York.
The Hyatts are also throwing in a $25 certificate for each room for food and beverage bought during the stay. The Sunday checkout time has been extended to 8 P.M. The Hyatt number is (800) 233-1234.
The Sheraton chain has two programs at 200 hotels, one for weekdays that requires reserving 14 days ahead but no payment, and the other for weekends, meaning arrival Thursday, Friday or Saturday, which requires no reservation. Either way, the price is reduced as much as 60 percent. For the Sheraton Washington, the rate is $79 rather than $231 a room a night; for the Sheraton Boston, $108 rather than $250 a night. At the Sheraton Centre in New York, the regular rate is $225 a night but the special rate is $109.
The weekday program runs to Sept. 3; weekend rates to Dec. 29. Sheraton's number is (800) 325-3535.
Radisson calls its program Shades of Summer. It offers discounts of 25 to 50 percent. A reservation is required, but there is no deadline and no advance payment. The available days vary by hotel, so you have to check. At the Radisson Empire in New York, rooms are available for $98 Sunday to Thursday that would normally cost $150 to $250.
In Minneapolis, the Radisson Plaza is offering rooms for Friday or Saturday night at $85 that would usually cost $114 to $169. At the Radisson Suite Hotel Rancho Bernardo in San Diego, rooms are $68 to $78 that would normally be $95 to $105. The Radisson number is (800) 333-3333.
Marriott began its advance purchase-discount plan last week. If you book and pay 21 days ahead at 190 of its 200 hotels, you can get 40 to 60 percent off the regular rates for rooms that can be used by one to five people. On a weekday at the Washington Marriott, it would be $89 a night for a room, in contrast with the regular July weekday rate of $200 for a double; on the weekend, the advance-purchase price would be $65 for the room; at the Cambridge, Mass., Marriott, a weekday room would be $95 instead of $190 for a double; the special weekend rate is $79. At the Marriott on Lexington Avenue in New York, a weekday night would be $99 instead of $230 for a double; the weekend night special is $79. Payments 14 days ahead bring lesser discounts. These programs continue until Sept. 2. Reservations are not changeable or refundable.
In addition Marriott has a $99 Discover Manhattan discount for its Lexington Avenue and Financial Center hotels. It does not involve advance payment. This is offered for Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights until Sept. 8.
Marriott's number is (800) 228-9290.
 
Is the Rate Available?
 The day after Marriott's Discover Manhattan $99 plan was advertised June 9 in this newspaper and others, a Detroit man called to reserve a room for Sunday, June 23, and was told that rooms at that price for that night were sold out. Instead he was offered a room for $199, and he complained to the Travel section of The Times .
A call to Marriott reservations not identifying this column was placed on June 11, with the same result. However, a $99 room was available for Sunday, June 30, and a reservation was confirmed. Marriott said that the 10 percent set-aside meant that 117 rooms in all were available each night in Manhattan, but the spokesman, Gordon D. Lambourne, said that advertisements had appeared earlier than June 9. For some weekends, the set-aside was 20 percent, he said.
The New York City Consumer Affairs Department complaint section reported receiving no complaints about the June 9 Marriott ad. The city policy on specials of this sort is that the merchant must earmark for sale at the advertised price a supply large enough to meet "reasonably anticipated public demand." Susan Kassapian, the department's chief of litigation, explained that expectations of demand would usually be based on responses to earlier advertisements of the sort. "When we get an avalanche of complaints," Ms. Kassapian said, "we investigate to find out how many were set aside in advance of the ad. The tipoff is if they all call the day after the ad runs." The commission is at 42 Broadway, New York, N.Y. 10004, and the complaint office number is (212) 487-4444.
Independent hotels in Manhattan say they set aside much higher percentages of rooms for advertised specials, because of the Consumer Affairs Department's activism. Last fall, hoteliers at a dozen moderate-priced hotels said the range was 30 percent to 98 percent of rooms. One offering this summer, at the Roger Smith Winthrop, Lexington Avenue and 47th Street, is $99 a night for two weekend nights, with breakfast in bed for two included. As long as the hotel is not fully booked, anyone who calls and asks for this Fun Quick Getaway rate will receive it, a hotel spokeswoman said.
Mr. Lomano's view that the bottom line is not the bottom line was borne out this month by a New Jerseyan who wanted to reserve at the Vista Hotel in Lower Manhattan. Told that the rates were $215 to $240, he said he guessed not. "What were you thinking of?" the reservationist asked. They agreed on $160, and the traveler said he would call back. He got another reservationist then, but the agreed-upon price was accepted. With taxes, it came to $192.

HEADLINE: Kayak Odyssey in Alaska

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD; ROBERT REINHOLD is chief of the Los Angeles bureau of The New York Times.

 BODY:
WE had been in our kayaks not more than 20 minutes, paddling out into Icy Strait at the beginning of a five-day sea-kayaking tour in Alaska, when there was a loud whoosh nearby and a tall spray of water shot into the cool air. We turned and suddenly a huge, dark glistening form rose from the water nearby, showed a large fin and dived again. It was a humpback whale, which played cat and mouse with our six tiny kayaks for the next half hour as a bald eagle circled overhead and sea otters and seals popped their heads up from the water to peer at us quizzically.
The encounters were an exhilarating start to a kayaking tour of the waters and forested islands near Glacier Bay in southeast Alaska, an adventure that offered a close-up glimpse of some of Alaska's great natural wonders, a world of whales, seals, grizzly bears, mink, bogs, meadows and wildflowers all set in a vastness and near pristine desolation that persists despite the advancing depredations of the timber, oil and mining industries. 
 It should be stated that this is not for the frail or those who demand modern comforts when they travel. While the basic technique of kayaking is easy enough to learn for any moderately fit person, it requires stamina and lugging of boats and supplies. It also means camping in small tents on remote beaches, accepting an element of risk and, almost inevitably in southeast Alaska, being cold and wet much of the time. We had eight inches of rain in five days, which was not unusual in the rain forest that is southeast Alaska.
But for those willing to endure such discomforts the reward is a rich experience and an education about the fauna, flora and geology of the last American frontier. I was on the Marine Mammal Discovery tour of Alaska Discovery, a 19-year-old outfit based in Juneau , the state capital, which runs a variety of kayaking, river rafting, hiking and other wilderness adventures in Alaska and the Soviet Far East.
Joining such a group tour with strangers is always problematical. The entire trip could be spoiled by one or two complainers or, conversely, by an environmental zealot who lectures you about where not to spit your toothpaste water. Even worse, an inexperienced or unqualified guide could turn the adventure into misery or even danger.
No such problems arose, though. The group was led by two thoroughly professional Alaska guides, Judy Brakel and Art Bloom, both unflappable and assured. Judy had been leading such tours for a dozen years and was something of an expert in the edibles of the rain forest and intertidal zone, disappearing at times and returning with plastic bags full of such delectables as beach spinach and wild asparagus. Art, a Brooklyn-born former biology researcher for the United States Forest Service in Alaska, was enormously informative about grizzly bears, fish and other wildlife. Actually, we had two and a half guides, for Art brought along his good-natured teen-age son, Scott, who was the ultimate Boy Scout, quietly wandering off with his fishing pole after we camped and returning with a dozen or so fish for dinner.
The guides typified the kinds of lives led by those who have migrated to Alaska for its wild splendor, piecing together unconventional livelihoods. Judy guides kayak tours by summer, processes unemployment claims for the State of Alaska by winter. Art spends his summers in Alaska and goes south for the winter, to Chile, where he has a business guiding fishing and rafting trips.
The group itself was an odd but affable mix that seemed to work well. There was a newly married couple from Minneapolis of stern Norwegian stock who thought sleeping in a leaky tent was a splendid way to spend their honeymoon, two single women, both graduate students from the University of Michigan, and four single men: two of them environmental lawyers, one a maritime engineer from Florida and myself, trying not to be obvious as I took notes on a soggy pad. All were experienced in back-country camping. The Alaska Discovery brochure had warned participants that they should have spent sufficient time tent camping and hiking and should be in good physical condition and excellent general health.
For all the wildness, this was by no means the strictest of wilderness regimens. An advantage of travel by kayak rather than foot is that the boats have plenty of room for fresh food, a large propane stove, fishing gear and numerous other small comforts that loom large after a strenuous day of paddling against wind and rain. The meals, prepared mainly by Judy, were delicious and generous. And the object was to view marine mammals and other wildlife in a leisurely way, not break any kayak speed-racing records. We spent four to five hours a day kayaking and covered three to four miles for a total of perhaps 20 miles, but each day was a different outing, not part of continuous route.
The trip started in Gustavus, a 30-minute flight across the Inside Passage from Juneau. Gustavus (pop. 218) is a rather spare place, unincorporated without paved roads, government, police, doctors or building codes, spread over a flat glacial plain homesteaded earlier in this century. Today the village, with a handful of small inns and bed-and-breakfast establishments, is the entry point for Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve.
After a briefing from our guides, we pulled on our rain suits and boots. We loaded the six two-people kayaks and all our gear onto two fishing boats at the Gustavus pier for the three-hour ride across the mouth of Glacier Bay and then across Icy Strait to a small sheltered cove on Chichagof Island. It speaks volumes about Alaska to say that this vast island, an area of thick forests and mountains that is larger than Delaware, has only three permanent settlements with a total population of about 1,000. In five days, we saw no other humans except for fishing boats far out in the strait.
A high ceiling of gray clouds over the craggy snow-clad Fairweather Range gave a forbidding hue to the vast expanse of icy water and islands that opened before us as the boat churned across the strait. We planned to paddle along the north coast of Chichagof Island, ending at Point Adolphus, a favorite haunt of the thousands of humpback whales that migrate north to Alaska for the spring and summer.
It was sobering to know that the forces of nature are so powerful and rapid in Alaska that this journey would have been impossible 200 years ago. The British explorer George Vancouver ventured through Icy Strait in 1794 and found an intimidating wall of ice 4,000 feet thick across the entry to what is now Glacier Bay. Since then, for reasons not well understood, the ice has retreated with astonishing speed 65 miles north into Glacier Bay, bringing vast ecological changes to the region.
We unloaded at Gull Cove, on an inlet homesteaded half a century ago but now quite desolate. In the calm waters, Judy and Art instructed us in how to get into the kayak, attach the splash skirt meant to keep water out of the holes in which the paddlers sit, legs straddling bags of gear, and to paddle. The worst fear in such frigid waters is turning over, but the fiberglass craft seemed fairly stable.
THE first day was purposely a short one. We paddled for about three hours, covering maybe two miles, with a detour to chase our first humpback, and put in at a long crescent-shaped beach of blackish sand to set up the first night's camp. Behind us was an almost impenetrable forest of Sitka spruce and western hemlock, a climax forest, as foresters call it, meaning that it has never been logged, and the older trees -- some as old as 350 years -- have begun to die.
Camping anywhere in Alaska presents one particularly tough problem -- bears. Chichagof is inhabited by grizzly bears, or brown bears as they are more commonly called in Alaska, and an effort must be made to avoid too close an encounter and to prevent them from raiding the food supply. Brown bears, which can weigh as much as 1,100 pounds, are determined scavengers and are said to be particularly menacing once they learn that campers carry food. So we carefully placed our cooking area far from the tenting area, thoroughly washed all plates and pots before retiring and hung the food bags in trees at night.
A nice thing about Alaska in the spring is that the days seem to last forever. It did not get dark until nearly 11 P.M. and first light appeared by 3 A.M. As we set up for dinner, Art and his son Scott disappeared for a long time. They returned with two large Dolly Vardens, a type of char similar to trout. Judy, meanwhile, wandered down the beach and came back with wild celery and yellow violets and something she called beach lettuce. The first supper was nothing short of sumptuous: spaghetti with meat sauce and salad of cauliflower, carrots, mushrooms and the wild greens, plus the two fish, cooked on a grate over an open fire, all washed down with a California Riesling. The night ended with a hilarious group effort at trying to lift the food bags into trees with ropes.
The second day started with breakfast of French toast and coffee, supplemented by limpets, small shellfish, and seaweed, which Judy found when the tide was out and later fried. With that, we lugged the kayaks back into the water and set out for a long day of paddling through beds of kelp and some fairly rough seas. For company we had sea otters, seals, sea lions, dolphins, Canada geese, brent -- almost every variety of bird and mammal that haunts this coast.
At midday we got a spectacular surprise. With the tide high, we wandered up a creek that opened into a large grassy meadow behind the trees. Art was the first to spot them and hushed everybody. We beached the kayaks and grabbed our binoculars. There, at the edge of the meadow, two enormous brown bears were feeding peaceably on the vegetation. Silently, we marched forward to get a closer look, Judy bringing up the rear with a rifle slung over her shoulder. The weapon was for protection, not hunting. We kept a distance of at least 100 yards, watching the bears for half an hour. It troubled me a little that should our curiosity have enraged these animals, it might have been necessary to kill them. It is legal in Alaska to shoot a bear if threatened, but we retreated without incident.
Soon after, the rains that dogged us for the rest of the trip began. Rain in southeast Alaska is usually not heavy -- more relentless drizzle than downpour -- and we soon became accustomed to it. The guides were certainly prepared; when we arrived on the second night at a broad delta called Mud Bay, the kitchen was placed under a large tarp held up by four kayak paddles. Tired, wet and cold, we devoured a dinner of couscous, vegetable soup with seaweed, wild asparagus, salad and chocolate mousse and watched the tide douse the fire we had set on the beach.
Before we left Mud Bay the next morning, Art led a walking tour through the brackish delta, meadows and moss-covered forest bottom behind the beach, explaining that these fragile ecologies on the margin of the island provide habitats for deer and other mammals to survive the long, harsh winter. The snow is generally not as deep here as inland because of the warming effects of the sea. In spring, the meadow was abloom with lupine, marsh marigolds, skunk cabbage and other Arctic flowers. Two black-tailed deer grazed at the edge, then fled as we approached.
We spent the next couple of days paddling along the coast toward our final destination, Point Adolphus. We spent the last night on a beach near the point where, after a dinner of spinach fettucine with pesto sauce and more Dolly Varden, we watched the sky clear enough to give us a fine sunset over the Fairweather Range.
THE last day was in a way the best. I awoke at 5 A.M. in my tent to a loud whooshing sound, pulled on my boots and walked to the beach. The water was glass calm, and just offshore a parade of perhaps six humpbacks lumbered by. They dove one by one, their enormous flukes flying into the air and then gracefully slipping into the water. After breakfast we hiked along a deer trail for a mile or so and came upon yet another glorious sight high in a spruce tree: a bald eagle's nest with two chicks. The vigilant mother flapped her four-foot wings as she hopped from limb to limb, not at all happy about our presence, her fierce yellow eyes darting about under the white feathers of her head. Soon after, we broke camp to head for our pickup by the fishing boat and on the way fell in with a pod of nearly a dozen humpbacks. There followed a mad scramble as we paddled wildly to get nearer. They came so close we could almost touch them, and they rewarded us with a spectacular display of flukes.
Just then, far out in the strait, a cruise ship headed for Glacier Bay appeared on the horizon. As it neared, we focused with binoculars on the decks of the ship, the Star Princess, and pitied those who had spent thousands of dollars to see all this from a remote distance. They looked back at us through binoculars, and perhaps they pitied us. We had paid $1,000 each to spend five cold days in kayaks and tents.
 
GETTING CLOSE TO WHALES
 
When to Go
Southeast Alaska sea-kayaking season is from about May 20 to Sept. 5.
Experienced kayakers can rent boats for an unguided tour. Rentals are available from companies like Glacier Bay Sea Kayaks in Gustavus. Daily rates are $40 for up to three days, $35 for four to six days and $30 for seven days or longer. Drop off by charter boat deep in Glacier Bay is $88 a person one way, $166 round trip. Details from Post Office Box 26, Gustavus, Alaska 99826; (907) 697-2257.
 
Accompanied Trips
Alaska Discovery offers regular departures to destinations like Icy Strait, Glacier Bay and Icy Bay. The five-day, four-night marine mammal excursion costs $950 a person, which includes everything but air fare from Juneau to Gustavus and sleeping bag, rain gear and rubber boots, available at $50 extra if needed. A seven-day tour through Glacier Bay National Park is $1,300. Details from 369 South Franklin Avenue, Juneau, Alaska 99801; (907) 586-1911.
Another operator is Spirit Walker Expeditions in Gustavus, which offers guided whale-watching trips ranging from two days and two nights at $450 a person to seven days and six nights at $1,000. Details from Post Office Box 240B, Gustavus, Alaska 99826; (907) 697-2266. R. R.
 
FOR FACTS, WAIT
If you are planning a trip to Alaska and want a tourist brochure, you will have to wait till fall to get one. Last fall the state printed 700,000 brochures for 1991.

HEADLINE: Chicago Gets Hot as a Site for Film Making

BYLINE: By ISABEL WILKERSON

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
For years Chicago was a pleasant afterthought in Hollywood, the source of gangster movies or period pieces or the Chicago-specific productions that did not lend themselves to New York or Los Angeles. Now Chicago is becoming the first choice for a generation of film makers who are escaping the expense and congestion and cliches of the coasts or are seeking unvarnished realism.
The result has been an explosion of film activity here in the last few years. Major producers and directors like John Hughes and Ron Howard are turning to Chicago to create all-American stories of ordinary people, people who may not eat tofu and use cellular telephones but who bring in big numbers at the box office. 
 Two of what are expected to be the summer's biggest releases were shot entirely in Chicago and are suffused with Windy City sights and sensibilities. One is Mr. Howard's "Backdraft," the current hit starring Kurt Russell and Robert De Niro. This adventure-mystery, which is about firefighters and an investigation into the death of one, features fire trucks racing through the city and a funeral procession down Michigan Avenue. The other major new release is Mr. Hughes's "Only the Lonely," a romantic comedy starring John Candy and Ally Sheedy that is intended to be to this city what Woody Allen's "Manhattan" was to New York.
This summer, yet another crop of films set and shot in Chicago are to open. Disney Studios is coming out with "V. I. Warshawski," starring Kathleen Turner as the Polish-Italian private detective of the title; Columbia Pictures is offering "Gladiators," starring Brian Dennehy in a story about underground boxing; and Warner Brothers will release Mr. Hughes's "Curly Sue," starring Jim Belushi as a homeless man who lands in Chicago with his adopted 9-year-old girl. Later this year, Mr. Hughes will begin production in Chicago's northern suburbs on 20th Century Fox's "Home Alone II," the sequel to last summer's big hit, which was also shot here.
All of this is helping a city better known for its bare-knuckles politics and cutting-edge architecture make a name for itself in the world of dollies and grips. Chicago was perhaps the prime beneficiary of the seven-month film-craft union strike in New York that ended in late May. Several indigenously New York productions -- from the film adaptation of the Broadway play "Prelude to a Kiss" to the pilot of a detective series set in New York and fittingly called "Empire City" -- are being shot in the Windy City instead of the city that spawned them.
Yet the infatuation with Chicago began before film making virtually shut down in New York. In the quest for a new realism and an authentic Middle America of corn dogs and mini-vans, many producers have chosen Chicago over rival sirens like San Francisco and Boston and even Toronto, despite its favorable exchange rate.
What producers and directors find appealing, they say, is Chicago's mix of down-home ethnic and city sophisticate, its post-modern and turn-of-the-century architecture, and an Everywhere, U.S.A., quality that lets film makers convert it easily into other cities. Particularly attractive is its unjaded, what-can-we-do-for-you approach, which makes the implausible in New York -- like shutting down a major artery for a couple of days -- a breeze in Chicago. "The city sort of hands you the keys to the city," said Steve Roth, the producer of "Gladiators."
In a competitive, bottom-line industry, many say they work better in Chicago because its film industry is innately less neurotic than that of New York or Los Angeles. "There is still an underlying normalcy in Chicago even though it's a big city," said the actress Elizabeth Perkins, who got her start on the Chicago stage and appeared with Demi Moore in the very Chicago movie "About Last Night . . ." (1986). "Chicagoans," she said, "are still like people you'd see in a mall in Rockford."
The relatively recent discovery of Chicago by producers and directors also means it hasn't gotten hackneyed, that it looks vaguely unfamiliar to film makers and their audiences. "It still feels special to do a film in Chicago," said the director Chris Columbus. "It hasn't been overused like New York and L.A. It's like a little jewel for some of us."
 Mr. Columbus and Mr. Hughes have entered a kind of symbiosis with Chicago. Mr. Hughes has shot 11 films here in the last eight years, two of them directed by Mr. Columbus ("Only the Lonely and "Home Alone"). And both men have developed such an affection for the city that they have bought property and moved here.
 Lately they have been operating out of an abandoned high school converted into a makeshift studio, where interiors are shot in the gymnasium and dailies are screened in the auditorium. Over the years, Mr. Hughes's films have used everything from O'Hare Airport to the annual German-American Parade, leading many people to call Chicago "John Hughes's back- lot." It is a mutually beneficial relationship that is likely to continue now that Mr. Hughes has signed a seven-picture deal with 20th Century Fox. The first movie will be the "Home Alone" sequel, to be directed by Mr. Columbus. It will be shot a few miles from where Mr. Hughes lives.
Mr. Hughes, who grew up in Chicago's affluent North Shore suburbs, tried living in Los Angeles once. It lasted only a couple of years. "Los Angeles is a very special place," he told The Hollywood Reporter last winter. "It's richer, more diverse, nicer weather. It's a newer place, a place of dreams." But, he added, "Chicago is a place of realities."
That realism is what Mr. Columbus says makes their movies accessible and lucrative. The two men surround themselves with people who drive carpools to Little League practice rather than the hip men with ponytails and Armani suits tooling around Westwood. "As you're driving to work, it's nice to know that you're going to make a movie while other people are going to a law firm or to fix somebody's plumbing," Mr. Columbus said. "You're around real people."
 Other film makers are learning what Mr. Columbus and Mr. Hughes have known for some time. And so for reasons of art and economics, the story of the most famous New York Yankee ever to pick up a bat will be recreated not in the Bronx, where Babe Ruth made his name, but in Chicago, where Cubs fans still haven't gotten over losing the 1932 World Series to him and the Yankees.
For the Babe Ruth story, currently in production, Wrigley Field was the logical choice: it was in the best shape and had none of the neon billboards that would give away the decade. Wrigley will play three roles in the movie -- Yankee Stadium, the Polo Grounds and itself. A ballpark in Danville, Ill., will serve as Fenway Park in Boston and an old field in Baltimore. And a chic North Side street is being converted into turn-of-the-century and Depression-era New York, Boston and Baltimore, with period awnings and cobblestones and hay over the asphalt.
"Chicago is probably the only city in the country where, with the exception of a few days in Danville, we can film the whole picture," said William Finnegan, an executive producer of "The Babe," which stars John Goodman and Kelly McGillis and is to be released next year.
Union problems figured more prominently in the decision to move the film version of "Prelude to a Kiss," which ended its Broadway run last month, from New York to somewhere else. New York was central to the urban fairy tale of a young bride named Rita whose soul gets trapped in the body of a dying widower who gives her a fateful kiss on her wedding day. But those involved with the film say that Chicago had what was necessary for the story.
"All that was important was that it be a big city with grit," said the playwright Craig Lucas, who adapted his play to a new medium and setting. "Chicago's not quaint like Boston and San Francisco. Those towns are so romantic, it was too easy. I didn't want charming. I wanted the feeling of a very on-the-edge world. Chicago has a much bigger edge to it."
"Only the Lonely," a comedy about an Irish cop torn between his overbearing mother and the mortuary cosmetician he falls in love with, was supposed to be shot in New York, too. But between the film maker's love for Chicago and the argument that the story of an Irish cop made more sense here than in New York, the movie ended up on the shores of Lake Michigan. Thus filmgoers get the grand tour watching Mr. Candy and Ms. Sheedy picnicking on the infield grass of old Comiskey Park and watching the sun rise over Lake Michigan.
One measure of the city's growing maturity is the way film makers cast their films here now. For years, directors would fill all but the most peripheral parts in Los Angeles or New York and fly the cast in mainly for exteriors. But the growing reputation of Chicago theater, whose alumni include David Mamet and John Malkovich, has created a pool of talent that directors are starting to use. "The Babe," for example, is hiring dozens of Chicago actors and thousands of extras in period knickers and bowler hats.
Its polyglot population makes Chicago a kind of film makers' supermarket. If a script calls for it, casting directors do not have to settle for somebody who can act Polish; they can just go to the Northwest Side and find a real Pole. That is what happened when the Warner Brothers movie "Men Don't Leave" (1990) was in town and needed a couple of hundred Polish polka dancers, the stouter the better, to dance with Jessica Lange. Poles from the local polka parlors turned out in droves.
And when Lorimar Pictures' "Next of Kin" (1989) needed Italian women to mourn at a funeral, dozens of them in their 80's and 90's showed up from a nursing home around the corner, dressed in black and wailing as if they had lost their firstborn.
 There was a time when Chicago was not so amenable to film makers. The late Mayor Richard J. Daley was especially protective of Chicago's image and practically forbade film making during his 22 years in office. After his death in 1976, officials aggressively sought the attention of Hollywood with former Governor James Thompson traveling to Los Angeles to lobby the city's case. The town's breakthrough movie was the oddball 1980 hit "The Blues Brothers," starring John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd.
Now, however, the officials' salesmanship is really paying off. "We've been on top of the roller coaster for a year and haven't come down yet," said Barbara Roche, a Chicago-based casting director. Which leads some to worry that Chicago, like New York and Los Angeles and New Orleans before it, could become a cliche, that maybe people will get tired of the ubiquitous, you're-in-Chicago El train. Especially as long as film makers look through the same lens as, say, Jeff Kanew, who directed "V. I. Warshawski" with this premise: "Any location we picked, we tried to get it near an El train."
Chicago fans in Hollywood doubt that could happen. They say it is too versatile a location to become passe just yet. "I've got 20 years' worth of films left to do in Chicago," Mr. Columbus said. "I'll never get tired of it."
 
 
 
ON THE SCENE
 Seven feature films are either in production in Chicago or about to begin by early summer. They are:
* "Prelude to a Kiss," directed by Norman Rene and starring Alec Baldwin and Meg Ryan.
* "The Babe," directed by Arthur Hiller and starring John Goodman and Kelly McGillis.
* "Folks," directed by Ted Kotcheff and starring Tom Selleck.
* "Mad Dog and Glory," directed by John McNaughton and starring Robert De Niro.
* "Straight Talk," directed by Barnet Kilman and starring Dolly Parton.
* "League of Their Own," directed by Penny Marshall and starring Debra Winger.
* "Mo' Money," directed by Peter MacDonald and starring Damon Wayans

 
 
OF 'BLUES' AND GREEN
 Major film making in Chicago is considered to have begun in 1978. That's when chase scenes for "The Blues Brothers," starring John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd, sent cars careering down lower Wacker Drive and crashing through glass windows at Daley Plaza, proving that Chicago could handle the oversized, stunt-filled productions usually reserved for the coasts.
Eight film and television projects were shot in Chicago that year. By 1980, the number had reached 19. And after a lull in 1987 and 1988, attributed to the screenwriters' strike, 28 companies chose to work in Chicago in 1989, spending $33 million in the process.
Last year, slightly fewer projects -- 24 -- were filmed in Chicago. But the productions, including "Flatliners," "Home Alone," "Uncle Buck" and "The Music Box," were large scale. They frequently stayed for extended periods, used a greater number of Chicago locations and employed more local residents. The contribution to the city's economy was a record $65 million. -- Pamela Kripke

On the Block, Glossy Survivors From the 18th Century

BYLINE: By RITA REIF

 BODY:
Rare when they were made, American 18th-century furnishings with lacquerlike japanned finishes continue to be uncommon commodities on the antiques market. In recent months, however, two pieces have become available for sale in New York, focusing attention on the fewer than 50 surviving period chests, clocks and chairs with this Oriental-style decoration, which imitates the hard, shimmering finish of Japanese lacquering.
Last October, a William and Mary highboy was exhibited by Israel Sack, a Manhattan dealer, at the International Antique Dealers Show in New York. Its price tag of $2.75 million was one of the highest for any object at the fair. Although not sold at the show, the flat-topped cabinet with trumpet legs, all lavishly embellished with exotic birds, flowers and pagodas in Oriental landscapes, was bought in March for $1.5 million by the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond. 
 "This important piece will serve as an anchor for the museum's American collection," said David Park Curry, deputy director for collections and curator of American art. "It pulls its weight as an artwork, not as an artifact." He cited its rarity, saying the 64-inch-tall chest, made in Boston, is one of fewer than 10 extant from the William and Mary period.
The second japanned object to become available is a signed Queen Anne clock from Massachusetts, made in 1740, that is almost eight feet tall; it is to be auctioned on Thursday at Sotheby's in New York. Unknown to scholars until it was sent to the auction house in February by an unidentified seller, the clock is gilded and decorated with Oriental figures, birds and foliage on a tortoise-shell ground, a painted finish popularized by Boston and New York artisans during the period. Although the surface is lusterless and certain sections are worn, most of the japanning is intact, according to William Stahl, who heads Sotheby's sales of American decorative arts.
"The clock has been lived with for more than 200 years and was not abused," he said. "There are some areas where there is minor damage to the raised decoration. All things considered, the fact that this has survived with 90 percent-plus of its gilt, gesso and background intact is extraordinary."
The seller told Sotheby's that the clock had been owned by only one family and had never been on the market. The owner gave the auction house an undated, unsigned, handwritten note, which Sotheby's has published in its catalogue; it details what the auction house says is the clock's early pedigree. According to this document, the clock was inherited "from Thomas Clap manse." Sotheby's states that the Thomas Clap in question is the man who was president of Yale College from 1740 to 1764 and a member of the Clap family, which had settled in Scituate, Mass., in 1633. Sotheby's presale estimate for the clock is $200,000 to $300,000.
According to Harold Sack, president of Israel Sack, a concern founded in 1905, the scarcity of japanned American furniture is nothing new. "We've handled no more than three or four pieces in all our years in business," Mr. Sack said. "No one knows how many were made and how many were stripped of their finishes when they became discolored, were partly destroyed or were judged to be less fashionable."
When asked why he had lowered the price of the highboy when he sold it to the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, Mr. Sack said it was because of the recession. "It's possible that in a couple of years someone would have come along and paid the price," he said. "But we had too much invested in the piece and decided we should not wait."
The costliest piece of American japanned furniture sold at auction was the only known example of a kneehole chest, a 1730 Queen Anne design made in Boston that brought $264,000 at Christie's in New York in 1988. The buyer, Eddy G. Nicholson, a New Hampshire industrialist, recalled recently that Christie's faxed him when he was on safari in Kenya to tell him how rare the bureau was.
"It is difficult to call from Kenya -- but I reached New York and said, 'Just buy it for me,' " Mr. Nicholson said. "It took almost two years to be restored, and it turned out that 90 percent of the decoration was still there."
The largest collection of American japanned furniture is at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, whose William and Mary and Queen Anne highboys, lowboys, mirrors, a shaving stand and clock are on permanent display. The surfaces are covered with the full repertory of Oriental motifs, plus, on a William and Mary highboy, offbeat additions like kites, bats and a well-fed camel.
"Painted surfaces on furniture and in architecture were extraordinarily widespread and popular in the 18th century," said Morrison Heckscher, the Metropolitan's curator of American decorative arts. "The japanned painted decoration was a Western imitation of Japanese lacquer, which was so much admired but unavailable. Most of these japanned surfaces were stripped down during the early 20th century when there was a preference for natural wood."

Indifference To Culture

 BODY:
To the Editor:
What Frank Rich expresses when he deplores the exclusion of work by excellent producers like Joseph Papp, Lynne Meadow and Andre Bishop for Tony competition is that all theater is really one theater, each part nourishing and depending upon the others, no matter how experimental or escapist. But by giving an appreciative picture of the accomplishments of Papp, Meadow, Bishop, etc., Mr. Rich overlooks the dark side of the situation: that the theaters run by those producers are as endangered as those on Broadway, not to mention the many others that are even more venturesome and vulnerable and serve as the laboratories and seedbeds of the art. 
 A rotten economy and shrinking arts dollar are the immediate causes of the dire circumstance, but even more disturbing for the long term is a prevalent social and political sensibility indifferent to the arts in general and hostile to the ones that can somehow "talk back." Not just a superannuated Broadway but an entire theater culture is in jeopardy.
The truth is that the substantive theater for adult minds that Mr. Rich and everyone who loves the power of human expression wish for is, and long has been, impossible within the commercial structure of Broadway. Audiences who pay those prices just aren't in the mood for risky experiment or challenging exchange. In "Phantom of the Opera," the chandelier falls every night -- a type of certainty that Mr. Rich's justly esteemed young playwright Jon Robin Baitz, or a truly well served Shakespeare, for that matter, will never provide.
The theaters in the West 40's that now stand dark could be lighted up with both contemporary and classic work, but that would take subsidy far beyond what is now even imagined as adequate. And the public subsidy I refer to requires public will. In a society that refuses to educate its young, protect its elderly and satisfactorily serve the rest, just when might we expect that to appear?

Summer Offers In Caribbean

 BODY:
Every summer Caribbean tour operators and hoteliers join forces in offering discounted travel packages to lure tourists during the off-season. This year's off-season lull comes on the heels of a particularly slow winter, when the combination of war in the Persian Gulf and the economic crisis in the United States discouraged many would-be vacationers. As a result, some promotional packages offered this summer have been sweetened more than usual.
Trans World Airlines' tour group, T.W.A. Getaway, has lowered prices of its packages by about 30 percent compared with last summer. Among the packages is a three-night, four-day stay at the Sands Hotel and Casino in San Juan, Puerto Rico, for $439, which includes breakfast and dinner each day and round-trip air fare from New York. More information: (800) 438-2929. 
 Several resorts on the island of St. Lucia have discounted their rates. Among them is Le Sport, an all-inclusive resort and spa, which will refund $349 to guests paying summer rates of from $185 to $240 a day a person and staying seven or more nights. The rates include all meals and drinks, spa treatments, sports facilities, taxes and gratuities. The offer is good until Dec. 15.
Air Aruba is offering a package that provides air fare, lodging and food at selected resorts for children between the ages of 2 and 11 when an adult buys a full-price ticket. The plan is available on Aruba, Bonaire and Curacao. More information: Air Aruba, (800) 827-8221.
Club Med at Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic will allow children aged 2 to 6 to stay free, excluding air fare, as part of a family, until Aug. 26.

Route Reopens In California

 BODY:
Visitors exploring the California coast north of San Francisco can once again enjoy easy access to the Marin County seaside with the reopening June 15 of a stretch of State Route 1 between Muir Beach and Stinson Beach. The road had been closed since January 1990 when a 600-foot section began sinking toward the ocean after the Loma Prieta earthquake in October 1989. Over 500,000 cubic yards of earth have since been moved to recarve the roadway deeper into the hillside.
While Stinson Beach remained accessible by a twisting two-lane road known as the Panoramic Highway, the reopening of State Route 1 provides a welcome straight and rapid route to the tiny beach town that has suffered tremendous economic loss during the closure. Beyond Stinson, visitors can continue north to Point Reyes National Seashore.

HEADLINE: First-Time Home Buyers Now Leading The Market

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY

 BODY:
AT the end of 1988, when Robert and Christine Scuderi decided to marry, they talked, as newly engaged couples often do, about buying a home some day. Back then, the prospects for homeownership for the 21-year-olds seemed like a distant dream.
But the right combination of timing and hard work -- they both took on second jobs, he cutting grass and trimming hedges, she waiting tables -- put the Scuderis in a two-bedroom condominium in Carmel, N.Y., in February. 
 "After we decided to get married," said Mr. Scuderi, assistant controller for the National Realty Company in Purchase, N.Y., "we could see prices starting to come down. We decided that buying a home was more than just a pie-in-the-sky idea. So we started saving in a serious way. Chris and I were each able to save at least $200 a week."
The Scuderis are not alone. After years of sitting on the sidelines because of soaring housing costs and high interest rates, first-time buyers throughout the metropolitan New York region are returning to the housing market in large numbers and now dominate it. They are benefiting from a decline in home prices, favorable interest rates and flexible home-loan policies in both the private sector and state mortgage agencies.
Among the recent first-home buyers are Garfield and Donna Hall, who set up a household in a new condominium in Ridgewood, Queens. They took advantage of a low-interest, low-down-payment State of New York Mortgage Agency loan.
Gina and Christopher Russell held on to an inheritance earmarked as down-payment money, waiting for prices of their ideal home -- a loft in Manhattan -- to come down to their price range.
Robert A. Marino is one of the stouthearted first-time buyers who have ventured into the fray of real estate auctions. He was among the successful bidders at a May 19 auction for one of 54 apartments in Columbus Common, on West 90th Street and Columbus Avenue in Manhattan. Mr. Marino's bid of $300,000 captured a three-bedroom apartment with skylights and a balcony. The asking price in the prospectus was $469,000.
First-time buyers like these were the dominant force in the market in the Northeast last year, according to Century 21, the national residential brokerage company. The company's records show that this category of buyer represented 52 percent of all 1990 sales in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Maryland and Massachusetts.
"The current market has been a cyclical break for buyers who had the door shut on them in the 1980's," said John A. Tuccillo, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors. "Affordability has increased for first-time buyers because of a moderation in prices and interest rates. But down payments are still an obstacle for many."
ESTELLE KLEIN, a sales associate with Coldwell Banker in northern New Jersey, said that in many places it is the first-time buyer who is keeping the market afloat. One reason is that first-time buyers are not encumbered with homes they have to sell. Many families who already own homes and want to move up to something larger or more luxurious find themselves trapped because they cannot get prices they find acceptable.
Despite the large number of first-time buyers, the Census Bureau reported earlier this month that home buying was still an impossible dream for most American families. The bureau found that 57 percent of all families did not earn enough to buy houses in their regions. The report further noted that home ownership was particularly difficult for black families and young couples.
Nevertheless, many banks and independent mortgage companies say that loans to first-time buyers have become a larger percentage of all mortgages written in the last year or so.
A major reason is that the average rate for a 30-year fixed instrument has hovered around the 9.75 mark, a drop from the 10 percent average rate of a year ago.
The State of New York Mortgage Agency, known as Sonny Mae, which caters to first-time buyers, reported that between January 1990 and March 1991 the dollar amount of loans made through the agency increased from just over $24 million to $41.7 million.
Paine Webber Mortgage Company, the residential lending division of the financial services company, has seen about a 50-50 split in the loans it is making to first-time buyers and those trading up or buying a second home.
Carmen A. Culpeper, president and chief financial officer of Sonny Mae, said the decline in prices was starting to provide much-needed relief to moderate-income buyers.
"In New York City an income of $50,000 or $60,000 was not high enough to buy for many years," she said. "But these days the drop in interest rates and lower prices, coupled with the push by lenders like us and Fannie Mae [the Federal National Mortgage Association], have made the difference to a lot of people.
"I don't know how long prices will continue to drop. We are trying to make the most of it by offering loans that will bring as many people into the market as possible."
She said Sonny Mae's most popular loan is a 30 year, fixed-rate mortgage, currently at 8.4 percent interest and 95 percent financing. In March the agency introduced a new fixed-rate mortgage with down payments as low as 2 percent. The mortgage, backed by tax-exempt bonds, has limits on both household incomes and the home-purchase price.
The Halls, who last month moved into a new town-house development, Cypress Gardens, in Ridgewood, Queens, are among those who bought with the help of a Sonny Mae loan. "The loan put our plan to be in our own place a bit ahead of schedule," said Mr. Hall, who is the manager of a home-supply store. "The 8.5 percent rate that Sonny Mae was able to arrange meant that we were in our new place as soon as it was finished."
The Halls, who used wedding-gift money for the down payment, paid about $128,000 for their two-bedroom town house. They were also able to save about $2,000 while living with Mrs. Hall's family.
Creative loan programs by mortgage lenders have not been limited to agencies like Sonny Mae and Fannie Mae. Paine Webber Mortgage is among the lenders designing new products with the first-time home buyer in mind.
One loan being offered by the company is a 30-year, fixed-rate instrument that has an introductory rate below 8 percent. This mortgage, which carries 3 points, currently has a rate that starts at 7.78 percent in the first year, rises to 8.78 in the second year and reaches a permanent rate of 9.25 in the third year.
"This provides a two-year cushion," said Christopher Puorro, a senior loan officer with Paine Webber Mortgage in Cranford, N.J. "The lower payments can be a help to some first-time buyers because it gives them some breathing room in the early years of the loan. In some cases the points can be wrapped into the loan amount."
CHRISTINE CULLEN, a first-time buyer who works for Nabisco Brands as a manager of a fleet of company automobiles in Parsippany, N.J., hopes to use the mortgage to buy in Hopatcong, N.J., where she recently bid on a two-bedroom house.
"With this loan," said Ms. Cullen, who said her price range is between $110,000 and $115,000, "I would like to try to buy the most I can afford right now while prices are low and interest rates are good."
Not only has the marketplace been more welcoming to first-time buyers, but the fresh opportunities also seem to have encouraged families to help. Gift money figures prominently in the financial equations of many first-time buyers, particularly newlyweds.
In addition to holding two jobs each, the Scuderis also had help from her parents. They cashed in A.T.&T. stock they had bought when Christine was an infant. That put $27,000 into the couple's wedding and house purchase fund.
The moonlighting and living at home before they married enabled both Scuderis to put away at least $200 a week. By last fall they had more than $50,000 in savings and gift money. That covered their wedding as well as the $27,000 down payment on the condominium and $3,000 in closing costs.
In another stroke of luck, the builder of the complex, the Fairways in Carmel, took 22 percent off the prices of the last 20 units in an effort to close out the development. The Scuderis paid $124,000 for a 1,500-square-foot unit with two bedrooms, a den, an eat-in kitchen and two and a half baths.
"We worked hard," said Mrs. Scuderi, who is employed as a secretary until she can find a job that will put her marketing degree to work. "But everything came together for us. If the market and interest rates had not been on our side, Bob and I would have had to choose between the kind of wedding we wanted and buying a home."
For many first-time buyers the drop in prices has provided not only a toehold in the market but also a chance for a better buy.
Gina and Christopher Russell, who closed in May on a loft in the West Village, believe that if they had tried to buy their first home two or three years ago their budget would have taken them no further than a cookie-cutter apartment in a high-rise.
"We have had a lot of friends buy lofts over the years," said Mrs. Russell, a graphic designer. "As artists, a loft was the ideal home for us. But we had a pretty good idea what most of our friends were paying for their lofts and it was basically out of the question for us."
The couple, who have lived in an apartment in Brooklyn for the last few years, started looking at lofts after Mrs. Russell inherited money. "My inheritance made it possible for us to start considering buying a home," she said. "But the main factor in our getting the loft was the market. If prices had not fallen we might have been able to buy an apartment, but we would not have been able to get what we really wanted."
The Russells paid $330,000 for a 1,350-square-foot loft on Hudson Street with private roof space. Units the same size have sold for more than $400,000.
Donald C. Hannah, president and chief executive of U.S. Auctions, a marketing consulting company in Stamford, Conn., said the promise of bargain-basement prices had made auctions particularly appealing to people who had never been able to afford their own apartments.
"MANY of the auctions being held in the metropolitan area now are offering products that fall into the economic realm of the first-time buyer," said Mr. Hannah, whose company organized the auction of the units at Columbus Common last month.
But Mr. Marino, who bought at that auction, which drew 1,200 bidders, described the event as stomach-churning.
"I have a professional familiarity with the market," said the 38-year-old Manhattan-based real estate tax consultant, "and I was really nervous."
He said his strategy was to sit as far back in the room as possible to see all bidding hands and to wait until bidding got close to his price range before joining in because "I was determined to stick to my ceiling of $300,000."
"But it happened so fast," he said. "In about five minutes I went from being a renter of a studio to owning a three-bedroom apartment. There was a lot of luck involved."

Staff Reduction
Question: I am a rent-stabilized tenant in a 131-unit co-op. The co-op owners account for 40 percent of the occupants and rent-regulated tenants the rest. Until recently, the maintenance staff included a superintendent, two porters and a handyman. In the last few weeks, however, the sponsor has defaulted on maintenance payments. To reduce costs he dismissed the handyman with the blessing of the co-op board.
They seem to be reducing services to safeguard their financial investment. Do they have the right to do this? . . . Franklin Schornstein, Jackson Heights, Queens 
 Answer: It depends on whether the dismissal constitutes a reduction in services to tenants. It would be up to the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal to determine this.
The sponsor and board had the right to make the change without consulting the other shareholders or tenants, but not at the tenants' expense. Co-op and condominium laws say remaining tenants in converted buildings have a right to the same services and conditions as before the conversion.
The board may plan to have the handyman's jobs done by another employee or part-time worker. But if you and other tenants find this unsatisfactory, you can file a reduction in services complaint with the state housing agency. You should be prepared to describe exactly how the loss of the handyman affects the quality of tenants' lives. If the agency agrees with your complaint, it can order a reduction in rents of all units owned by the sponsor.
The appropriate forms are available at the Queens office of the D.H.C.R., 92-31 Union Hall Street, Jamaica.
 
Air-Conditioner Noise
Question: Recently the building across the street was renovated from warehouse to office space. A large ventilation system was installed on the roof. It runs all day and sometimes at night, making a loud noise that can be heard in my apartment even with the windows shut. Are there legal limits to these types of noise levels? . . . Andrew J. Miller, Manhattan
Answer: Yes. The city has standards limiting the level of persistent noises. Martha Holstein, a deputy commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection, which enforces the laws, says you should call the agency to make an appointment for an inspector to measure the noise from your apartment.
This can be done after business hours if that is when the noise is most bothersome. If the noise is above the legal limit, the owner will be required to correct the situation.
"Sometimes it is as simple as turning off equipment during nonbusiness hours," said Ms. Holstein.
Businesses that ignore requests for modification risk violations.
 
Paperwork Fee
Question: I recently decided to have the old, single-paned windows in my co-op apartment changed. I found a contractor, got a bid and asked the managment agency what else I would need to get approval. It is asking for the usual things (proof of contractor's insurance, etc.) plus a $150 processing fee. I think the fee is outrageous. Can I refuse to pay it and still put in my windows? . . . Kevin Ramsey, Manhattan
Answer: Probably not. The co-op board has the right to set procedures and require permission for this sort of work. Proceeding without permission would risk more serious problems with your co-op, including a possible suit. If other shareholders agree with you, together you might be able to get the board to drop or lower the fee.

HEADLINE: Streetscapes: St. Ann's Church;
An 1869 Work With a Shaky Future

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY

 BODY:
NEXT Sunday is the cutoff date for the New York City Council to establish new procedures for nonprofit owners of landmark buildings to appeal for relief because of financial hardship. Preservationists are nervously considering which buildings might be the first to bring a request for demolition under liberalized rules.
One that always gets a second look is the 1869 St. Ann's Church, owned by Packer Collegiate Institute in Brooklyn Heights. This elaborate Victorian gothic sanctuary has been vacant since 1967 and requires at least $6 million in repairs. Dr. Frank Bookhout, the school's business manager, calls it a "bomb that's ticking away." 
 The parish was organized in 1787 and in the mid-1860's plans were prepared by the firm of Renwick & Sands for a new church building. James Renwick's St. Patrick's Cathedral was then largely complete in Manhattan; that and his 1843 Grace Church at 10th Street and Broadway in Manhattan had put him and his Gothic Revival designs at the forefront of church architecture in the city.
But for St. Ann's the architects chose the "Second Pointed style," in the words of Harper's Weekly in 1869. The new St. Ann's that rose on the northeast corner of Clinton and Livingston Streets was a rich polychrome mix of cocoa-colored Belleville brownstone, stripes of white Cleveland stone and contrasting roof slate.
The interior, designed to seat 2,000, is a vast, high space with intricate timber trusswork, a broad three-sided gallery and dozens of richly colored stained-glass windows. There are elaborately carved Gothic style pews, polychrome tile floors and broad sweeps of stenciled and mosaic decoration, especially around the chancel. The Harper's Weekly article attributes the original decoration to "Cohn," apparently Louis H. Cohn, an active decorative painter in the period.
Large, undisguised cast-iron columns support the gallery and roof and run down each side of the nave. There is also cast-iron wainscotting along the side aisle walls. Andrew Dolkart, a specialist in the history of church design in Brooklyn, said that St. Ann's is among the earliest American churches to use cast iron in such a way.
Harper's Weekly called the church "a masterpiece of art"; it was one of the many that made Brooklyn "the city of churches." Indeed, St. Ann's was built within three blocks of two other churches, Grace Church at Hicks Street and Grace Court and the Church of the Holy Trinity at Montague and Clinton Streets.
According to an article in The World, the congregation went into debt to build its new church. By 1878 the debt amounted to $135,000. On May 28 of that year the Union Dime Bank began foreclosure proceedings. But the next morning, Robert F. Cutting, a Wall Street banker, contributed $60,000, enough to keep control of the structure. The World article said that Cutting gave the money as a memorial to his wife, the eldest daughter of the rector at St. Ann's, Dr. Noah H. Schenck.
There was little change in the building through 1964, when the Rev. Melville Harcourt, the rector, complained that the parish was shrinking because "when a couple is blessed by an addition to the family . . . it is generally more economical to move elsewhere."
In 1967, the congregation sold the church to its neighbor, Packer Collegiate Institute, and merged with Holy Trinity as St. Ann and the Holy Trinity. Packer renovated the undercroft for its use but apparently did not have a clear idea for the 7,800-square-foot sanctuary, which has not been used on a regular basis since the congregation left.
NOW the interior is a mix of pigeon droppings, minor leaks, age-darkened paint and soft rays of light filtering through the stained glass. Little has been changed. The velvet pew cushions remain untouched and there is such an emptiness that the settling of dust can almost be heard.
Dorothy Hutcheson, assistant head of Packer, said the school has given up trying to sell, share or rent the church. The Brooklyn Heights Synagogue was interested for a time, she said, but was put off by the high cost of repairs. Packer retained a respected preservation firm, Mesick, Cohen & Waite, to study the building. Its estimate, just to repair the existing structure, comes to about $6 million.
Now, Ms. Hutcheson says, "we have basically prostrated ourselves at the feet of the New York Landmarks Conservancy," a private preservation group helping St. Ann and the Holy Trinity in its own $16 million rehabilitation campaign. Packer has not ruled out applying for a hardship permit, Ms. Hutcheson said, but "we need to feel we've done everything we could to save the building."

HEADLINE: Eighth-Grade Parties: Tuxedos, Gowns and an Uneasy Air

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

DATELINE: RUTHERFORD

 BODY:
"THIS is hysterical," said Joan Froelich, 19 years old, as she watched the young people in strapless gowns and tuxedos posing unself-consciously before a phalanx of video cameras. "No way are these kids eighth graders," she said.
But they were.
Ms. Froelich, a sophomore at Scranton University in Pennsylvania, had returned to her old elementary school to watch a time-honored rite of passage: the eighth-grade Pierrepont School graduation party. But this was not the same event Ms. Froelich remembered from six years ago. 
 "I wore a party dress," she said. "Only one girl was really dressed up, and she was the richest girl in the class."
Ms. Froelich's reaction underscores a trend in elementary and middle schools statewide -- a trend parents call expensive, psychologists call excessive and teen-agers call exciting.
"I think they're growing up too fast," Ms. Froelich said.
 
At Graduation, a Transformation
 The Pierrepont School in Rutherford is a typical elementary school in Bergen County. Students arrive with books in hand and cross the street only at the command of crossing guards. At the end of the day they head home in small clusters: boys with boys and girls with girls.
Then, on the eve of graduation, they are transformed.
"It took me almost five hours to get ready," said Karri Bille, 14 years old, who arrived at the party in a strapless aquamarine gown matching the color of her eyeshadow. The dress, she said, cost $120, adding, "I'll probably never wear it again."
Nearby, Erica Lima, 14, stood with her date, Mark Ramdas, also 14. Mark, his hair short, stiff and very shiny, was wearing a tuxedo carefully tailored to his compact frame. In a flash of boyish impulsiveness, he momentarily abandoned his date and went chasing after a colleague who was also wearing a tuxedo.
Erica, in a red satin gown with high puffed sleeves, took advantage of the moment to confide to a friend, "My feet are killing me."
Each year, parents of Pierrepont eighth graders reward their sons and daughters with an end-of-the-year dinner-dance. The parents decorate the school gym, prepare the meal and then, in a role they are no doubt accustomed to, serve as waiters and waitresses for the youngsters.
But the dinner-dance, which began as a simple graduation party, has evolved into an elaborate affair. Last year, before the recession hit suburbia, some students arrived in limousines.
"We really don't encourage the children to dress up," said Ellen Keane, co-chairwoman of this year's event. "We try not to make this a grammar school prom."
But for the students, that is what the dinner-dance is.
"We just don't go down to the Shore after it," said Glenn Lynch, 14, who wore a cream-colored tuxedo for the affair.
 
'It's Getting Out of Hand'
 The Pierrepont School is not alone. Many elementary schools and middle schools across the state have their own versions of eighth-grade graduation parties. Some are in school gyms or local halls; others are fancy catered affairs in expensive restaurants or luxury hotels.
The Mount Hebron Middle School in Upper Montclair has its annual eighth-grade dinner-dance at the Atrium West Caterers in West Orange. Students, or more precisely their parents, pay $35 each to attend.
"I think it's getting out of hand," said Diana Quinones of Upper Montclair, whose daughter, Amy, is graduating from Mount Hebron. "I think the kids these days are rushing things. They're trying to make this more than it should be."
Mrs. Quinones said her daughter asked if she could rent a limousine to take her and some friends to the affair.
"I told her I would be her limousine for the night," Mrs. Quinones said. "I'm not going to pay for a limousine for an eighth grader."
School officials at Mount Hebron say that while they do not prohibit formal dress and rented transportation, they do encourage students to dress in a way that is appropriate for an eighth-grade activity.
But Mrs. Quinones said the school should set definite rules. "These are 13- and 14-year-olds," she said. "They're not adults."
Officials of the Toms River Regional Schools in Dover Township have also notified parents of the district's desire to keep this year's affair simple. The message, however, has often been accompanied by protestations from the children.
 
'Everybody's Dressing Up'
 "Everybody's dressing up," Danielle Onorato, 14, a student at Toms River Intermediate East, said while conferring with two friends about potential dates. "It's like a competition. Everybody tries to dress better than everybody else."
And while Danielle's mother, Debbie Onorato, says she believes that the affair has become "a bit much," she is in a quandary: How can she force her daughter to wear a simple party dress when all her friends will be wearing formal gowns?
"Every year the principal writes home and says there is no need to go out and get ultra-fancy dresses, and every year the kids continue to dress up," Mrs. Onorato said.
Mike Wherry, assistant superintendent of the Toms River schools, said it was up to the parents to set the limits on what their children could wear.
"We've tried to tell the parents to have the kids dress nice and neat and to discourage all this other stuff that goes on," he said.
Mr. Wherry said that this year, as a result of that message, he expected students to dress a bit less elaborately. "It's really nothing more than the eighth-grade social," he said, adding that almost 1,000 students are expected to attend.
But if Danielle and her friends are right, most of the students are buying gowns or renting tuxedos, and some, perhaps many, are renting limousines.
While school officials say parents should draw the line and parents say officials should, psychologists say the children are getting mixed signals.
"You're giving the kids a double message," said Dr. Lois Goorwitz, a psychologist in Upper Montclair. "If you really want to discourage this, you lay down ground rules: No one wears strapless gowns. No one wears tuxedos. And no one arrives in limousines. Period."
Dr. Goorwitz said that encouraging or allowing 13- and 14-year-old children to act and look like adults was a mistake.
 
'Are We Pushing Them?'
 "To give kids that age the message that they should be engaging in what is basically a precocious sexual relating is just not wise," Dr. Goorwitz said.
While teen-agers are now being warned of the dangers of casual sexual behavior, she said, younger children are being encouraged to act more and more like adults.
At the same time, Dr. Goorwitz said, "the ante keeps going up in terms of what behaviors are socially acceptable."
Some parents, while acknowledging that their children's lives are more adult-like than their own were, see no harm in allowing youngsters to enjoy themselves.
"Are we pushing them?" asked Dr. Eugene Graziano, a Rutherford physician who was a waiter at his daughter's Pierrepont School dinner-dance. "Maybe we are. But this is something that we didn't have as kids. Maybe it's guilt on our part. We didn't have it so we want them to have it."
 
No Reason to Deprive Them
 Dr. Graziano said that as long as parents could afford to provide such experiences for their children, and followed up by being good, caring parents, there was no reason to deprive the children of such social activities.
 
Life as a Black-Tie Affair
 But some parents do not like the idea that their sons and daughters are being rushed into adulthood and perhaps being given a distorted sense of values.
"The children here in Woodcliff Lake think that life is a black-tie affair," said Leslie Ryan, a teacher of the visually impaired whose daughter, Katie, will be graduating from the Woodcliff School next year. The school, which holds its annual dinner-dance at the Woodcliff Lake Hilton, discourages the wearing of formal attire.
Mrs. Ryan said that for Katie, who is 12, next year's dance will probably be anticlimactic. Her daughter, she said, has already been to nearly 25 black-tie affairs, mostly bar mitzvahs and bat mitzvahs for her friends.
 Mrs. Ryan, like Mrs. Onorato and many other parents, is caught between her daughter's predictable response to peer pressure and her own sense of what is appropriate for her child.
"So we're going to teach her a lesson," Mrs. Ryan said. "Next month we're taking her camping. She's already in a cold sweat."

HEADLINE: Ossining Architects Join Team to Return Soviet City to Glory

BYLINE: By ROBERTA HERSHENSON

DATELINE: OSSINING

 BODY:
AN ambitious project to create a new tourist center in Odessa, the Soviet port on the Black Sea, has found a base in this Hudson River town. How Gershon Palevski, an Ossining architect, found himself immersed in the dreams of Soviet planners is a story of imagination, vision and a kind of naivete.
For the last year, Mr. Palevski, a native of Vilnius, Lithuania, and his partner in the architectural firm of Studio RAI here, Lucio Di Leo, have been working on a master plan to rehabilitate Odessa. The plan was conceived by a Soviet artist and designer, Eugeniy Olenin, whom Mr. Palevski met on a trip to the Soviet Union last year. 
 The Ossining architects are the only Americans on the design team, which includes French and Soviet architects, chosen to help restore the deteriorating city, which was once known for its artistic vitality and eclectic charm. The team is backed by the Odessa City Council.
 
Money Lacking for Project
 Mr. Palevski explained that in Odessa, age and neglect are undermining the limestone buildings that survived two world wars and decades of Communism. Unlike streets in Moscow, for example, where the Soviets demolished historic structures, "the fabric of the 200-year-old city has been left intact," he said.
The architect described the seaport as "neoclassical, on a nice scale," and noted its reputation as a former "center of Russian culture with a cosmopolitan, multinational tradition."
Mr. Olenin, the project's director, said a tourist industry based on free enterprise could flourish in a revitalized Odessa, where miles of ocean beaches and restored hotels, museums and parks could attract visitors.
For the moment, though, efforts to attract foreign investors in the project are hampered by a lack of money. Thus, when the Russian-Jewish Cultural Center in Chicago invited Mr. Olenin to attend the center's second yearly festival of Russian art last month, he seized upon the chance to publicize his plan.
The project director also arranged to send a huge painting, representing the rise and fall of Odessa, to the United States. The work -- 24 feet wide, 10 feet high and 5 feet deep, and painted in three panels placed one in front of the other -- was meant to be the backdrop for a display in Chicago of the architectural models for the project, many of which remain in the Soviet Union.
But the 17 boxes holding the sections of the painting and its construction materials were marooned at Kennedy International Airport in New York City after arriving from the Soviet Union, Mr. Palevski said. No provision had been made either to send the large work from New York City to Chicago or to have it released from the airline's cargo building.
 
The Logjam Is Broken
 Mr. Palevski, as a member of the design team, was called to help get the painting through customs. After two days of discussions with increasingly higher placed officials, he said, he succeeded in breaking through what had become a logjam. The architect said he was not prepared, however, to pay for shipping the work to Chicago. He had it trucked to Ossining, where he assembled one part of the painting -- the middle section -- in the sheltered driveway of friends, Galina and Dimitri Kanevsky.
There it stood, a surreal sight among the trees, while Mr. Palevski tried to figure out what to do next. Painted in oils on boards by Aleksandr Roitburd, an Odessa artist, the work shows angels rising and falling amid landmarks of the city. Mr. Olenin and Mr. Roitburd, who own the painting, said the work would be too expensive to return to the Soviet Union, Mr. Palevski said.
The owners and the architect said they thought publicizing the painting's plight might attract someone who could arrange for a gallery showing or use the painting to help raise funds for the project. Meanwhile, Mr. Palevski said, he would hang as much of the work as will fit on his office wall, where people can go to see it.
In a subplot to this story, as told by Mr. Palevski, a group of people, as well as the painting, was stranded at Kennedy. Mr. Olenin, Mr. Roitburd, a Russian musician and several Russian painters en route to the Chicago festival with other artwork arrived at Kennedy without airline tickets for the trip's next leg, and with little money.
With the help of Mr. Palevski and Russian immigrants in Brooklyn, a bus was found with drivers willing to take the people and their smaller, more manageable paintings to Chicago. When the bus broke down on the ride home, more help was rounded up to get the visitors back to New York.
 
'Dedicated' People, if Naive

"They are naive people," Mr. Palevski said of the Russians. "They have little understanding that everything here costs a lot of money."
But he added that they were also "honest, dedicated" people, who "don't look for personal gain." He noted that he had not told the Olenin entourage of his own sacrifice: two weeks spent rescuing the painting and helping their group while his own work piled up.
Neither Mr. Palevski nor his partner has received fees for their designs for the Odessa project.
Mr. Palevski looked out his office window at the hills of Ossining, a town he said he picked to live and work in because it reminded him of Vilnius, "as much as an American city can resemble a European city."
He believes in the Odessa project, he said, because "it is the perfect region to restore" because it could again be a center of culture and tourism. And the city, in the southern Ukraine 750 miles from Moscow has "less bureaucratic problems" than areas closer to Moscow, making it more amenable to free enterprise, he said. But while Odessa would be "very easy to restore" architecturally, Mr. Palevski said, the project's success would depend on social and economic reforms in the Soviet Union. The planners want to create "a living, blooming city, not a museum," he said.

WOMEN AND FITNESS
 Westchester County's Women's Health and Fitness Weekend, to be held at the County Center in White Plains from Friday through next Sunday, is expected to draw 5,000 women and their families to a battery of events designed to shape them up and ship them out in improved condition.
 A Citibank Women's Health Conference on Friday from 9 A.M. to 4 P.M. offers free testing for blood pressure, cholesterol, skin and breast cancer and glaucoma; and workshops on a variety of subjects including single parenting, Elderlaw, menopause, arthritis and osteoporosis, and nutrition. The only charge is a $70 fee for mammograms, available to women older than 35. 
 During Saturday's Women's Health and Fitness Expo, from 9 A.M to 5 P.M., visitors may try rollerblading on one of the 100 pairs of two- wheeled skates available to be lent. Among 75 other exhibits, workshops, demonstrations, health tests and activities for children are a 17-foot-high simulated boulder for a bit of rock-climbing; aerobic and exercise dance sessions, low-impact bench-stepping, face-painting and karate.
 The big event is the Danskin Triathlon beginning at 8 A.M. Sunday with a half-mile swim in Lake Isle in Eastchester, followed by a 12.4-mile bicycle race on the Bronx River Parkway in White Plains and ending with a 3.1 mile footrace along the Bronx River Parkway to Kensico Dam Plaza in Valhalla, where prizes will be awarded. Triathlon training clinics will be held Saturday at 10 A.M., noon, 2 and 4 P.M.
 Last year's winner, Renee Goldhirsch, will compete again, as will Ethel Autorino, winner in last year's women's 60 to 64 age group of the Hawaiian World Ironman Triathlon, and the 1990 International Women's Triathlon Champion, Karen Smyers, who competed last September at Disney World in Florida. Each leg of the Danskin Triathlon is half the distance of the international competitions. For more information, call 285-2650.
 
UKRAINIAN FOLKWAYS
 Children from the Ukrainian American Youth Association of Yonkers will perform folk dances and songs of their ancestral country at 7:30 P.M. Tuesday in the New Rochelle Library.
 As students at the School of Ukrainian Studies of St. Michael's Ukrainian Catholic Church in Yonkers, they learn to sing and dance the way their forefathers and mothers did and learn to read and write in Ukrainian. From 5 through 16 years old, they also study the history, culture and literature of that republic, which is said to be the richest in the Soviet Union and has the cities of Kiev, Odessa and Lvov.
 The program will be narrated by Maria Kozicky under the direction of Dr. Orest Kozicky. It is free.
 
WEEKEND COLLEGE
 Working men and women who can't find time to pursue an undergraduate degree during the week now have an alternative. Marymount College offers the Weekend College, in session from Friday evening through Sunday. It features majors in business, economics, education, English, history, information systems and psychology.
 It takes about four-and-one-half years to acquire the credits necessary to obtain a degree, not much longer than daytime college. The cost is $215 a credit and classes begin in September on a year-round trimester basis.
 An open house in which the proram will be fully explained is to be held Saturday from 10 A.M. to noon on the Tarrytown campus. Personal interviews with admissions counselors are available Saturday by appointment from 9 to 10 A.M. and from 11:30 A.M. to 3 P.M. Call 631-3200, extension 295.
 
GALACTIC EVENTS
 Nine hundred and 37 years ago next month, in July 1054, a star in the constellation of Taurus the Bull exploded after running out of nuclear fuel, causing a supernova so bright that it was seen in broad daylight.
 This, and many other spectacular galactic events, may be seen in the new planetarium show opening at the Hudson River Museum titled "Galaxies," based on the book of the same name by Timothy Ferris, who narrates the program. Published by Sierra Club Books in San Francisco in 1980, "Galaxies" was also printed in paperback in 1982 by Stewart, Tabor & Chang in Manhattan.
 The show begins with Galileo's concept in 1609 identifying the hazy band of light that we call the Milky Way as a conglomerate of individual stars. It goes on to explore galaxies beyond the Milky way, some 100 billion of them, each containing billions of stars, observable through the planetarium's Zeiss Star Projector.
A supercluster of galaxies near the constellation of Virgo has as its core Virgo A, the giant ellipse of a thousand billion stars containing what some astronomers believe is a black hole in which hundreds of millions of dead stars are entombed.
 "Galaxies" can be seen through Nov. 24 on Saturdays and Sundays at 1 and 4 P.M. Admission is $4 for adults and $2 for children and the elderly. It will also be shown through September on Thursdays at 7 P.M. when admission will be free. The museum is at 511 Warburton Avenue in Yonkers. Call 963-4550 for more information.
 
LOOKING AT INSECTS
 Carol Maslansky, a former entomologist for the state, was involved in a yearlong surveillance program designed to combat an insurgence of Rocky Mountain spotted fever and equine encephalitis in the 1970's. She is now a consulting toxicologist, and she will conduct a four-session entomology course sponsored by the County Parks Department.
 From 2 to 4 P.M. today, July 28, Aug. 25 and Sept. 22 at the Marshlands Conservancy in Rye, Ms. Maslansky will lead field trips into the conservancy grounds and discuss the life styles and uses of the broad range of insects that live there.
 "I try to orient toward the majority of participants who come on a given day," she said. "If there are many children it will be a simpler program. Adults with a higher level of understanding will prompt a more complicated session." The course is free and there is no obligation to attend every session, but "people tend to come back at least once or twice," Ms. Maslansky said.
 She usually starts out with the basics -- such as, what is an insect and what makes it different from ticks or spiders, which are not insects. "There are a lot of misconceptions," she said. "Solitary nesting bees who do the majority of the pollination are not dangerous. Most insects are really quite mellow unless they're disturbed. They prefer to leave people alone."
 Insect behavior, in which a small group may observe the daily life of the dragonfly or damselfly in its native habitat, is the kind of program she devises on a more complex level.
 She recommends that particpants wear long pants, socks, long sleeves, comfortable shoes and carry an insect repellent. No pre-registration is required. The conservancy is on Route 1 just south of the Rye Golf Club. Call 835-4466 for more information.

Capturing the Range of Nature in an Exhibition on Wave Hill

BYLINE: By VIVIEN RAYNOR

DATELINE: THE BRONX

 BODY:
A "NEW POVERTY" in the museum scene has been replaced by resourcefulness. There has always been fund raising, of course, but now the need is for income to replace lost Federal and local funds. As a result, development officers are blooming like desert flowers (which may explain the surge in duplicate and irrelevant mailings) but there are other, firmer implications of privatization, like art auctions and museum exhibitions sponsored by galleries.
Even so, it is a bit of a shock to hear that Wave Hill, the Riverdale mansion where Teddy Roosevelt summered, Mark Twain lived and Toscanini stayed, is now considering weddings as a source of income. Not that the economic strain is visible: this estate overlooking the Hudson never looked better and the exhibition on view in the Glyndor House and Wave Hill itself might have been designed for those who love it but are not up to walking its 28 acres. Titled "Wave Hill Pictured," it brings some of these acres indoors by way of photographs in black and white and color. 
 Since 1965, when the estate, a gift to New York City, was incorporated, gardeners have been at work restoring the grounds and converting them for public use. This observer, for one, looks forward as much to the hickories and red (actually, port-colored) beeches as to the exhibitions and, strange to say, the present show and its book represent the first celebration of "plein-air" Wave Hill.
This began two years ago when Jean Feinberg, then Wave Hill's curator and director of exhibitions, chose the photographers, Lois Conner, Jan Groover, Stephen Scheer and Philip Trager. She gave them their heads with the scenery, keeping her own for a grave essay on the history and nuances of landscape photography. This takes into account a wide range of exponents from Timothy Sullivan to Stieglitz, from Eugene Atget, the chronicler of Paris, to Frederick Evans, the English specialist in churches; and from Ansel Adams to Minor White, Eliot Porter, Paul Caponigro and Lee Friedlander.
The Wave Hill group is not as varied as these photographers, perhaps because all focus on the same subject. Ms. Feinberg said they are so different that academics might see the "subjective and interpretative nature" of their pictures as detracting from their "informational value."
Despite her beginnings as a fashion photographer, Lois Conner, Ms. Feinberg says, is the only one of the group to have worked outdoors "almost exclusively." For Wave Hill, Ms. Conner mostly uses that gift to landscape, the banquet camera yielding a 7-by-17-inch image. The resulting panoramas have their disadvantages, because the eye is not always comfortable traversing wide tracts of wooded scenery. But for the shot of an American yellowwood, the format is ideal. Truncated, the tree stands slightly off-center with its four large lower limbs spread out and casting shadows on a lawn that seems powdered with snow. Behind, is a pergola, a balustrade and, under a thunderous sky, the dark mass of the Palisades. The lighting is strange; it could as easily come from tall Klieg lamps as the overhead sun.
A photographer who also paints, Jan Groover is noted for her carefully orchestrated and often mysterious still lifes. Yet at Wave Hill, she headed for the wild garden that adjoins the greenhouse and the aquatic garden. Working with two cameras, an 8 by 10 inch and a 2 1/2 by 4 1/2 inch, she surveyed the thickets where grow Snow in Summer, Warminster Broom, the occasional cutleaf staghorn Sumac and many other species.
Ms. Groover was there in all seasons but did her best work in the seasonless greenhouse filled with succulents, prickly, smooth and webby-looking. There is one picture that covers all kinds and their colors -- icy green, pink, orange and golden brown -- make them look good enough to eat, spines notwithstanding. The hothouse atmosphere suits this photographer.
With the color prints of Stephen Scheer it is necessary to have a cool head and a liking for what used to be called trick photography. Of all the exhibitors, Mr. Scheer is the least experienced with nature and the least willing to let it get the upper hand -- hence, perhaps, his partiality for double exposures. He also uses two cameras -- a 2 1/4 by a 2 1/4 inch and a 4 inch by 5 inch -- and sometimes a Polaroid for, as it were, preliminary sketches. Those who would know more about his technique should consult the catalogue.
As for the double exposures, it takes a few seconds to realize what Mr. Scheer is doing and to be sure he is doing it in every print, because some look like images of reflections in glass. This is not Surrealism a la Jerry Uelsmann nor is it abstraction for its own sake. It is not really anything but a virtuoso demonstration of what can be done with a camera.
Last but not least is Philip Trager, a lawyer in Bridgeport who began attracting attention with photographs of architecture in the late 1970's. He has produced three books, one of Connecticut photographs, another about Wesleyan University and the third on the villas of Palladio. While this is probably his most prestigious album, the reviewer remains loyal to the harder-won Connecticut images.
Mr. Trager's great gift is for treating buildings as if they were sculpture; he seems to be thinking about the invisible rear of a structure even as he photographs the visible front. And to Wave Hill he brings his same gift and a view camera to bear on the landscape, the sky and some of the incidental architecture. He pays attention to both the classical pergola with its stumpy columns, and the greenhouse with its Tudor outline and a classical stone portico.
It is in the scenes like that of two trees facing each other across a lawn that sweeps like a driveway around a creeper-covered wall that Mr. Trager does his finest work. The V of cumulus clouds hanging over the greenhouse at sunset is another stirring shot. On second thought, he is not a photographer treating nature like architecture but a photographer who portrays both with an intensity more often applied to human subjects.
The show that gives viewers fresh eyes with which to enjoy the nature outside. It remains through Oct. 27.

636 Professors Accept Early-Retirement Offer

DATELINE: BERKELEY, Calif.

 BODY:
Under an early-retire ment plan offered to meet a budget crisis, the University of California system will lose 636 faculty members.
Thirty-two percent of the eligible faculty members and 59 percent of eligible staff members have accepted the retirement package offered, said a system spokesman, Paul West. 
 But some of the faculty retirees will return as part-time employees either to teach or conduct research, said Carole Swartz, assistant vice president of the system's benefits program.
The University of California campuses at Berkeley and Los Angeles will shoulder the most severe losses. Nine percent of Berkeley's faculty, or 150 people, have agreed to retire, compared with 7 percent, or 159, at U.C.L.A.
Several prominent professors, however, are planning to return part-time at Berkeley, including Gerard Debreu, a professor of economics and mathematics who won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science in 1983, and Loftie Zadeh, noted for his work in artificial intelligence.
Two percent of Berkeley's staff members, or 320, have accepted the retirement plan, compared with 3 percent, or 532, at U.C.L.A. They will also be eligible for part-time employment, university officials say.
 
Infusion of Younger People
 The loss of faculty members is double-edged, administrators say. "Younger people will be coming in with new ideas, and that's good," said Earl Cheit, chairman of Berkeley's Walter Haas School of Business, "but the biggest problem is that you lose people who have institutional memory and experience that can't be replaced rapidly."
Eight of the 13 professors retiring from the business school will return to teach because they are "crucial to the curriculum," Professor Cheit said.
Vitelmo Bertero, who has been teaching civil engineering at Berkeley for 33 years and was director of an investigation of the 1989 San Francisco Bay area earthquake, will return to continue research in earthquake engineering. But 37 of 231 faculty members in Berkeley's College of Engineering will not.
"The faculty retiring all at once will probably affect the quality of education for a few years," Professor Bertero said, "but the young people have learned all that they can from us, and once the new group gets established, they may be better than the ones around today."
"I just hope the professors don't have to teach more courses," he said, "because then the research will be hurt, and you can't have a graduate school without research."
 
Minority Hiring Pushed
 Recalled professors will be paid as part-time employees, but with no benefits. After five years, they can be rehired as career employees. The number of professors returning part-time is not yet known.
Upon retirement, faculty and staff members who have accepted the "Five Plus" plan will receive five years of service credit plus a one-time sum equivalent to three months of salary.
Those urging the university system to hire more members of minority groups and women hope that the retirements will lead to more diversity among the predominantly white male faculty.
But Margarita Melville, associate dean of the graduate division at Berkeley, noted that in some departments hit hardest by the retirements, like engineering and mathematics, there were still comparatively few women and minority candidates from whom to choose. And some specialized subjects within departments might not draw a diversity of applicants, she noted.
"The chancellor's office can only recommend hiring a more diverse faculty," she said.
The retirement program, approved by the Board of Regents last fall, is intended to ease fiscal pressures on the university system, which since 1983 has had a budget gap of about $60 million a year. Recently Gov. Pete Wilson cut $295 million from the system's proposed budget for 1991-1992.
Ray Colvig, director of public information at Berkeley, said: "Money saved from those professors receiving high salaries can be used for purposes of part-time or temporary professors. Even though quite a lot of faculty will be coming back, the university will still save a lot of money."
Salaries for full professors range from $59,600 to $106,000 a year; most make about $80,000.

Korean Company Uses Campus As Film Backdrop

DATELINE: MADISON, Wis.

 BODY:
A feature film that will give audiences in Korea a look at what American campus life is like is using more than 100 University of Wisconsin students as extras.
The Patmos Production Company of Seoul shot campus scenes Thursday and Friday for "My Beloved Agnus," a film that follows a Korean lawyer's investigation into the murder of a Korean graduate student studying in the United States. 
 The director, Young Jin Yoo, said the Madison campus was chosen as the backdrop for the film because of its beauty and because the university has more than 400 students registered in the Korean Student Association. Between 20 and 30 Korean students took part in the filming.
"As students of the university, we are concerned about the image of the school shown to people in Korea," said Sunah Kim, an extra in the film and a sophomore from Seoul majoring in marketing. "We want them to see where we live and study."
 
Presenting a Positive Image
 Korean students participating in the film said they wanted relatives and friends back home to see a positive image of the university, said Young Kim, president of the Korean Student Association and a senior majoring in economics.
He said that with an increasing number of Korean students traveling to the United States, Koreans in general were becoming more aware of Western culture. He said he hoped the film would add to that awareness.
More and more Korean companies are going abroad to shoot their films, said Kyung Sick Shin, the producer. And there is a growing market in Korea for movies about colleges and universities in other countries, he said.
"People want to see what students do over here, what it is like for them," Mr. Shin said.
Theater and drama students at the university will be learning from the film as well, said Peyton Smith, the assistant director of university relations, who went on location with the filmmakers. He noted, for example, that students had a chance to learn first-hand about filmmaking and about Korea's film industry.
Scenes shot around campus will include the State Historical Society of Wisconsin, various university classrooms and the Union Terrace. The rest of the film will be shot in Chicago.
The filmmakers said the movie would be released in Korea and later translated to be shown in the United States. No release date has been set.

HEADLINE: There's No Stopping Europe's Airbus Now

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
Five years ago, when Airbus Industrie was still an unproven underdog, many airlines hesitated to order its aircraft because they were uncertain that Airbus would be around in a few years' time.
But Airbus is still alive and kicking. The European aircraft consortium has captured 30 percent of the world market and is gunning for close to 40 percent. It has shoved McDonnell Douglas aside to take the industry's No. 2 spot, and its rapid ascent even has some Boeing officials worrying about their company's survival. 
 With about half the world's aircraft market, the Boeing Company is not easily cowed. But Boeing officials say they are competing not just against a company -- but against the deep pockets of the French, German, British and Spanish governments, which the Americans say have improperly pumped $26 billion into Airbus to propel Europe into the aviation big leagues.
While Washington has taken little action against Airbus to date, the conviction that huge subsidies have enabled Airbus to mount a serious challenge in one of the few areas where the United States retains industrial superiority is fueling talk of a trade war. Airbus's success is all the more galling for American officials because aerospace is one of the major areas of surplus in the nation's trade balance.
For Boeing, the stakes are higher than ever in its jousting with the 21-year-old European consortium. Now that Airbus has a family of five aircraft, its order book has exploded, causing Boeing's share of last year's orders to plunge to less than 50 percent for the first time in decades. What is more, at this year's Paris Air Show, which ends today, Airbus's president, Jean Pierson, announced that the consortium would begin studying the development of a 600-to-700 seat aircraft, the largest passenger plane in history. This super jumbo jet would provide the first head-to-head competition for Boeing's 747, which has long been Boeing's cash cow.
Fearing that the 747's days as the unrivaled king of the skies may soon be over, Boeing, along with the Bush Administration, has turned up the rhetoric about Airbus's subsidies. Boeing executives say Airbus could undertake such a multibillion dollar project only with the support of big subsidies from the European governments.
"If they continue these subsidies, then there may be no one left in the business except Airbus in 15 years," said Lawrence Clarkson, Boeing's senior vice president for international affairs. "It doesn't take a lot to imagine a scenario where Boeing could not afford to bring out new aircraft. And if your product line becomes obsolete, you're out of the business."
 
Airbus's Bigger Bite
 Some industry officials say Boeing is crying wolf. But there is no denying that Airbus has bitten into the profit margins of Boeing and the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, making it harder for them to develop new aircraft. Airbus has chopped Douglas's market share over the last decade to 15 percent from 30 percent, and many analysts say Douglas's survival in commercial aviation may be in danger.
Industry officials also say that if the Europeans reject American demands to curb Airbus subsidies in trade talks being held in Geneva, Washington might slap higher duties on Airbus aircraft, Mercedes-Benz cars or other European products. Mercedes cars could be a target because Deutsche Aerospace, a subsidiary of Daimler-Benz A.G., is one of Airbus's shareholders. The others are British Aerospace P.L.C., Aerospatiale, a state-owned French company, and CASA, a state-owned Spanish aerospace company. The group formed because each thought itself too small to challenge Boeing.
Airbus officials say the Americans are angry because Airbus had the effrontery to break up the cozy hold that Boeing and McDonnell Douglas had on the world's aircraft market. In the Europeans' view, government aid was essential if they were to break into the business and develop modern aircraft. Airbus's advocates also accuse the Americans of hypocrisy, asserting that Boeing's and Douglas's commercial aircraft operations have received billions of dollars in indirect aid through Pentagon contracts.
 
The European Response
 "The Americans take the position that the Europeans are the black sheep and the Americans the white sheep, when the truth is that all the sheep are gray," said Airbus's Mr. Pierson, a big, bluff man who is alternately charming and combative.
"Whoever starts a war is going to find himself in a war," he added in an interview during the Paris Air Show. "If the Americans take some action, I can assure you the Europeans will respond."
To resolve the dispute through negotiation, the Americans and Europeans will somehow have to bridge a huge philosophical chasm. Washington's hands-off approach to commercial aviation clashes fundamentally with the hands-on approach Europe is taking in building a world-class aircraft industry.
Amid Europe's efforts to bolster high-tech industries, including computers and semiconductors, Airbus is one of the few successes. "Airbus is the jewel of European industry," said Paul Quiles, France's Transportation Minister.
Airbus expects to produce 200 aircraft a year beginning in 1993, compared with just 28 in 1986. Its order backlog of 990 aircraft, valued at $68 billion, is larger than the 722 aircraft it has delivered since its inception. If Boeing's 747 is excluded, because Airbus has no comparable aircraft, then Airbus won more orders than Boeing last year. What is more, despite the decline in orders because of the Persian Gulf crisis and the airline industry's financial crunch, Airbus forecasts it will sell more than one-third of the $680 billion worth of aircraft expected to be purchased over the next 18 years.
"The consortium is doing spectacularly well and is clearly exceeding by some distance its intitial objective of 30 percent of the market," said Wolfgang Demisch of UBS Securities in New York.
Airbus reported its first-ever operating surplus last year, which Mr. Pierson said means that it can rely less on government aid to develop aircraft. Last Thursday, Airbus for the first time entered the commercial bond market, borrowing $110 million to help fund the $480 million development of a 180-seat aircraft, the A321 -- a stretched version of its fast-selling 150-seat A320.
 
Far-Flung Operations
 Airbus reported revenues of $4.7 billion last year, and industry officials estimate that its surplus was between $100 million and $150 million. Mr. Pierson forecasts profits again this year on revenues of $7.4 billion, with sales climbing to about $15 billion in 1995, when its A330 and A340 long-range jets are in production.
At first glance, Airbus's truncated structure would seem destined to fail. The fuselage for each of its jets is made by Deutsche Aerospace in Germany, the wings by British Aerospace, and the tailfins in Spain by CASA. Then, big-bellied airplanes called Super Guppies fly the parts to Toulouse, France, where Airbus is based and where Aerospatiale assembles the parts.
Airbus started slowly, with two wide-body, medium-range aircraft, the A300 and A310. But Airbus's orders mushroomed as airlines became convinced that it was here to stay and as its planes demonstrated their reliability. It further caught fire three years ago with the introduction of its 150-seat A320, which competes against Boeing's 737. Its A330 and A340 long-range jets, for which deliveries are to begin next year, have garnered 250 firm orders.
"Now that they have a full family of aircraft and are making money, why should they still need subsidies?" asked Boeing's Mr. Clarkson.
For years, the overwhelming obstacle Airbus faced was breaking into the American market, which represents nearly half of worldwide aircraft sales. But Airbus gained a foothold by making aggressively priced offers to struggling carriers like Braniff and Eastern, whose bankruptcies have been a blow to Airbus. Today, it counts more solid carriers among its customers including American Airlines, Northwest Airlines and Trans World Airlines. And Airbus officials voice confidence that they will soon clinch a $6 billion deal from Federal Express involving 25 firm orders and up to 50 options.
Airbus's big break was Northwest's order for more than a hundred aircraft in 1987, of which 17 A320's have been delivered. "We were attracted to Airbus because it offers a new generation of technology," said Lawrence Kahn, Northwest's director of fleet planning. "The cabin is more spacious and comfortable and its cost of operation is lower. And the aircraft's computers have a self-diagnostic capabilities, which makes maintenance easier."
 
Complaints on Pricing
 Boeing and Douglas often complain that Airbus aggressively underpriced them, knowing that subsidies would help offset any losses. They criticize in particular the Northwest order, in which Airbus provided below-market-rate financing not just for the aircraft, but to help Northwest rejigger its balance sheet.
Alan Boyd, chairman of Airbus's North American operations, said his tactics are no more aggressive than his rivals'. "When you hear people talk about aggressive pricing, you're hearing people talking about our early days when Airbus was trying to penetrate the American market," he said. "Those days are over. There are no giveaways at Airbus."
Now Airbus is squaring off with Boeing and McDonnell Douglas in a high-stakes contest at Delta and United, which are expected to order dozens of long-range jets over the next few years to replace their aging DC-10's and Lockheed L-1011's. Airbus's A330 and A340 are pitted against Boeing's new 777 and Douglas's MD-11. Airbus has yet to sell any planes to Delta or United.
 
Boeing's Big Worry
 But for Boeing, the biggest worry is Airbus's hope to build a super jumbo that would trump the 747. Airbus plans to decide by 1995 whether to build a super jumbo, which could be ready for the market early in the next century, when a maximum number of 747's are expected to be retired.
Mr. Pierson said it would take up to $4 billion to develop the super jumbo. Airbus officials say they could finance this out of their fast-growing cash flow, but do not rule out obtaining refundable aid from European governments. Analysts say the price tag could soar to $10 billion.
Boeing is studying three options for building a successor to the 747: a stretched version of the 747, a double-decker 747 and a wholly new aircraft. But financing the project could be a problem because Boeing is already weighed down with the roughly $4 billion cost of developing its 777.
"If Airbus builds a super jumbo, it will be a serious problem for Boeing" said Morten Beyer, chairman of Avmark, an aviation consultant in Alexandria, Va.
Analysts say Boeing aims to push Europe to slash subsidies to prevent that problem. But achieving that goal will not be easy. Washington wants Europe to limit subsidies to 25 percent of development costs, while the Europeans insist on a 45 percent ceiling, down from Airbus's original level of 100 percent. American officials say European governments have provided $13 billion in development aid to Airbus since its founding, or $26 billion including interest.
Airbus officials say this aid is more loan than subsidy, because for each airplane it sells, Airbus repays the governments a predetermined sum. Washington complains that the repayments should be carried out under commercial conditions: over 15 years and at market interest rates. American officials also say Airbus's financial statements are confidential so competitors have no definite idea how much Airbus is earning, losing or being subsidized.
"I don't think there is anything transparent in Airbus," said S. Linn Williams, Deputy United States Trade Representative.
Mr. Pierson lambastes Washington's estimate of $26 billion in subsidies and cites a European study that asserts that America's commercial aircraft industry has received $23 billion in indirect subsidies. Airbus argues, for example, that Pentagon money that helped develop the C-5A military cargo plane indirectly helped Boeing design parts for the 747 -- an assertion Boeing denies. Mr. Pierson also says that the Americans are hypocritical, asserting that the Japanese government is helping finance development of the 777.
"They seem to be taking us for imbeciles," Mr. Pierson said
Airbus and European officials are demanding strict rules limiting the Pentagon's indirect subsidies. But Mr. Pierson seems convinced that the governments will ultimately agree to allow some subsidies in such a high-prestige industy. "All the sheep are gray," he said. "Our negotiations have to determine whether they'll be light gray or dark gray."
 
 
 
AIRBUS'S AFFABLE IRONMAN
 Jean Pierson, Airbus's burly president, breaks into a smile as he discusses how the consortium earned its first-ever profit last year. The 50-year-old Frenchman was an engineering whiz early in his career, and, at the age of 36, became head of the factory in Toulouse, France, of Aerospatiale, the state-owned aerospace company that is one of four Airbus shareholders. When Mr. Pierson took Airbus's helm in 1985, he proved himself adept at marketing.
Now he is trying to show he can handle finance, too. He says Airbus's profits were largely a result of his following the advice of a commission of experts to increase financial controls and to pressure the consortium's suppliers, which also happen to be its shareholders, to hold down costs.
The Tunisian-born Mr. Pierson hints that Airbus's shareholders should make the consortium's finances public because, he says, their secretive policies may be doing harm in Washington, which complains that Airbus is addicted to subsidies.
In the face of such criticism, he is proud that Airbus last week went for the first time to the international bond market to help finance a new aircraft. "The United States cannot deny that there is a declining curve of our subsidies," he said.
Mr. Pierson's big worry now is the financial crisis in the airline industry, caused by the Persian Gulf crisis and fiercer competition in the United States and Europe. "The problem in the years to come," he said, "is where will airplane financing come from?"

 
 
FIGHTING FOURSOME
 When it comes to fighting the Americans, Airbus's four partners present a united front, but on other matters they are often far less united.
Last year, Deutsche Aerospace, the German shareholder, was frustrated that all of Airbus's final assembly was done in France, so it demanded that some of the work be moved to Germany. Aerospatiale, the French shareholder, jealously guarded its role and opposed the request as inefficient, but finally agreed to allow final assembly of the 180-seat A321 in Hamburg.
Now Deutsche Aerospace is causing another spat within the group. It has persuaded Aerospatiale and Alenia, the Italian aerospace group, to study development of an 80- to 130-seat aircraft.
The Germans, eager to make their mark in large aircraft, would lead this consortium, which would be separate from Airbus. The problem is, Airbus is considering its own 130-seat aircraft, the A319, to complement its 150-seat A320 and 180-seat A321.
Airbus officials say the A319 could help Airbus compete against Boeing's 737 series. Airbus officials say it would cost $400 million to develop its A319 aircraft, but some $4 billion and huge subsidies for the German-led group to develop a 130-seat airplane from the ground up.
"I don't see why the Deutsche Aerospace group feels the need to reinvent the wheel," said an Airbus official.

Disloyal American Buyers Are Detroit's Latest Challenge 

Detroit continues to lose market share to the Japanese. But it is no longer a matter of poor quality. Nor of cost. The reason, according to a study released last week by the Brookings Institution in Washington, is that the Big Three have lost the loyalty of their customers. The authors, Fred Mannering and Clifford Winston, studied 488 households and their vehicle purchases over several decades. The authors argue that Americans are now more loyal to Japanese brands than to American ones. "Loyalty means repeat purchases, all other things like price and quality being equal," said Mr. Winston. A decade of poor products and poor service is to blame. Losing loyalty has been costly. "General Motors lost the most loyalty; Chrysler was next and Ford lost the least," Mr. Winston said. If the patterns persist, the General Motors Corporation's market share will fall from about 36 percent today, to 31 percent by 1995. Regaining loyalty will be difficult, the authors say. Not everyone agrees. "Early in the 1980's, Ford had a dismal product image," said Scott Merlis, an auto analyst at Morgan Stanley in New York. "No front-wheel drive. Its Pintos exploded. Then they unleashed a series of home runs and turned their market share and brand loyalty around." But the Ford Motor Company's revival took money and time, which are both in short supply.
 
Old Blue Gets Hit Again . . .
 
Poor old I.B.M. First it posted a 48.7 percent drop in earnings in the first quarter. And its stock fell sharply. Then there were two messages to managers from John F. Akers, the company's chairman, that got wide circulation. A little more hustle, they said. The market frowned again. Finally, the International Business Machines Corporation told analysts to prepare themselves -- earnings in the second quarter would not meet projections of 50 cents to $1.10 a share. The stock bumped to a bargain $99.25, down $1.75. But not everyone thinks I.B.M. is in such horrendous shape. "There are problems endemic to the industry right now," said Daniel Mandresh, who follows I.B.M. for Merrill Lynch. "It is still a $66 billion company and all that stands in the way of Japan's domination of our market," he said. I.B.M. finished the week at $99.60.
 
. . . And So Does Microsoft
 
Once friends, the Microsoft Corporation and I.B.M. are are increasingly rivals. William H. Gates, chairman of Microsoft, the largest publisher of software for the personal computer market, has written a memo of his own to his top managers, which was leaked to The San Jose Mercury News. In it, Mr. Gates worried about I.B.M. attacking Microsoft in systems software and about Novell Inc., another big software publisher, beating it in networking applications. Mr. Gates also groused about a lawsuit filed against Microsoft by Apple Computer Inc. and about a Federal Trade Commission investigation into the company's business practices. "Nightmares," he said. The stock market agreed. Microsoft's shares promptly fell $8.50, to $103.37, and finished the week at $102.25.
 
Subaru Switches Agencies
 
For 17 years, Subaru of America was loyal to its New York advertising agency, Levine, Huntley, Vick & Beaver. No more. It is switching its $70 million account to Wieden & Kennedy, a small shop in Portland, Ore., with about $250 million in billings. Wieden has the Nike Account -- which is hefty -- but not much else. Levine had taken Subaru from obscurity to prominence and then back toward obscurity. Subaru sold 150,000 cars in the mid-1980's, but only 108,000 last year. And Levine recently lost another big client, Frito-Lay. Some are wondering if Levine has a future.
 
Northrop Gets the BAT
 
It may have lost out on the most lucrative military contract in history -- up to $95 billion to build as many as 650 F-22 jet fighters -- but last week the Northrop Corporation won a consolation prize: A $2.2 billion contract from the Pentagon to build a super-smart thing called the BAT (brilliant anti-tank) weapon. It is a missile that is launched inside another missile. The development phase of the program is expected to last another 42 months..
 
Here Comes the Humvee
 
Americans love rugged all-terrain vehicles. Consider the success of the Jeep. Now they will get another. The LTV Corporation said last week it will begin selling the Humvee -- the high-mobility multipurpose wheeled vehile -- to the public. The Humvee, which is wide and low and possibly the homeliest champion of the Persian Gulf War, will cost between $40,500 and $44,000.

INTERNATIONAL

 
A Reward for South Africa?
 
Last week the South African Parliament scrapped its policy of classifying people by race. Four of Congress's five conditions for lifting sanctions against South Africa have now been met. And many believe the final condition -- release of all political prisoners -- will be met within a month. Will the Bush Administration lift sanctions? Most are betting it will, and soon. But there is strong opposition from the Congressional Black Caucus and anti-apartheid lobbyists. Don't lift sanctions until South Africa adopts a new constitution, they say. One that -- at a minimum -- gives black South Africans a vote. So far that change is elusive. South Africa's President, F. W. de Klerk, said he's willing to negotiate on a constitution. But he did not say when.
 
Trying to Win Back MGM-Pathe
 
Last week, Giancarlo Parretti, who owns 98 percent of the stock of the MGM-Pathe Communications Company, tried to fire Alan Ladd Jr. and Jay Kanter, the producers who run the company. But the courts said Mr. Parretti could not do so. Mr. Parretti, the Italian financier, bought the MGM studio last year for $1.3 billion. Then he merged it with Pathe Communications. It wasn't an easy deal to make. There were allegations about his character and about how he rose so quickly to power -- he started as a hotel clerk in Sicily. Though he did round up the cash to buy the studio -- mostly from Credit Lyonnais, the big French bank -- he did not have enough money to run it. So Credit Lyonnais advanced some more, but with a major catch: Mr. Parretti would have to give up his vote and his seat on the board. He agreed but is contesting the loss of control. On July 2, a Delaware court will hold a hearing. Mr. Parretti is not likely to get his company back.
 
Foreign Help for Airlines
 
How do you get capital to the nation's ailing airlines? Let foreigners buy in, says Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner. Now foreign carriers can buy 49 percent of an American carrier but only 25 percent of its voting stock. Not good enough to get the capital flowing. So Mr. Skinner is proposing to let them buy 49 percent of the voting stock. With commitments to buy $47 billion worth of aircraft by 1995, the industry needs money. But will Congress agree to Mr. Skinner's idea, especially when airlines are regarded as a strategic asset? As long as Americans still have 51 percent of the voting rights, Mr. Skinner believes Congress will go along.
 
 
 
THE ECONOMY

 
What After the Recession?
 
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, sounded chipper last week. He told the House Ways and Means Committee that the recession may have already ended. The data "are strongly suggestive that the bottom is somewhere in the second quarter," Mr. Greenspan said. And he told them that the recovery might not reignite inflation. That remains to be seen. "Recovery without recession requires subdued growth," said Alan Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Company. And while it is true that the "forecasts are for anemic growth of about 2 percent, we recognize this is out of line with history," Mr. Sinai said. Growth after a recession typically averages 6.5 percent. "In this economy that would be inflationary," Mr. Sinai said.
 
Bad News on the Trade Front
 
There's another little snag in the recovery. The merchandise trade deficit widened to $4.8 billion in April, according to the Commerce Department. That is a 17.4 percent jump. Most economists think that the increase in imports reflects the effects of a recovering economy. Demand is picking up, they say, and foreign companies are satisfying that demand. But exports were also strong -- just not strong enough. They increased about 4.5 percent for April to a record $35.6 billion.
 
Housing's Scant Gain
 
The housing industry continues to recover, but it is doing so without much oomph. New homes and apartment construction moved up a scant one-tenth of 1 percent in May, according to the Commerce Department. It was the first time since July 1989 that new construction registered gains two months in a row, but April's gain was a strong 8.2 percent."The housing sector leads the economy out of recession," said Thomas M. Holloway, senior economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association in Washington. "But for sustained growth, the economy needs to grow."
 
Bumps in the S.&L. Bailout
 
So far, the bailout of the savings and loan industry has cost taxpayers about $80 billion. The nation's top banking regulator, L. William Seidman, said last week that he needs about $80 billion more, which the Administration is expected to request. But neither Congress nor the Administration is happy with the way the bailout is going. "We were asking for corrections and improvements the last time the Administration sought funding," said Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, the Texas Democrat who heads the House Banking Committee. "The reality is they've got to have structural and substantive changes if they want to make the case for more money."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
An Unsettling Look Inherent In Recovery

BYLINE: By Sylvia Nasar

 BODY:
People love to talk about the Dow as if they were talking about a person. "The market is feeling nervous," they say. "The market wants to go higher." These days the market is acting more like a lottery winner worried that the telegram is a practical joke.
 Nobody can be absolutely sure that the recovery that seems to be underway is the real thing. "There's a possibility of a false start in the economy," said Laszlo Birinyi, a financial consultant. Indeed, the gross national product has popped up in the middle of half of all postwar recessions, only to slump anew. 
 That's what happened in the last recession, which was the worst since the Great Depression. In the spring of 1982, gains in consumer spending and homebuilding raised hopes that the recession was ending. Indeed, G.N.P. did post a tiny gain in that quarter, but it was half a year before the economy began growing. Ditto for the 1969-70 recessionette, the one that the current downturn was supposed to resemble.
It isn't hard to see why everyone's reluctant to pop the champagne corks. Last month's rally in cyclical stocks has petered out. Downbeat economic reports -- like those last week of a jump in unemployment claims and a levelling out in homebuilding -- keep trickling in. They helped send the Dow down to 2965.56, a decline of 34.89 on the week. Then, too, there are some scary-looking indicators lurking out there.
Mortgage rates have climbed along with long-term bond yields and are now more than a half a point higher than in February. Higher rates could clobber the nascent housing recovery. Rising unemployment could turn consumers skittish again. Recession abroad could keep European and Japanese buyers from snapping up United States exports.
But the threats look less fearsome up close. For starters, those mid-recession upticks in G.N.P. during past recessions mostly reflected unwanted inventory buildups. Today, business is still cutting stockpiles while sales are actually improving.
Even if unemployment passes 7 percent, the rise will have been less in this recession than in most others, and as long as the layoffs taper off, consumers should keep their cool. "Consumer spending probably rose at a 3 percent rate this spring," said economist Bruce Steinberg at Merrill Lynch.
Building permits shot up in May. Mortgage rates are likely to stay south of 10 percent, predicts David Wyss at DRI/McGraw Hill. "That's not enough to strangle the housing recovery," he said. "Besides, if people think mortgage rates are rising, they usually rush out to buy."
Exports aren't apt to collapse either. Growth in Germany and Japan, which has been stronger than predicted, may well slow. But other big United States trading partners like Canada are recovering and Mexico and Southeast Asia are booming. Despite its recent rise, the dollar is no stronger than it was last summer.
Uncertainty and mixed signals are bound to persist for a while. But that may not be all bad. Remember, that unsettled state is itself one of recovery's most reliable signs.

HEADLINE: Making a Difference;
The Money Man at Baltia

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
About a year ago, Harold J. Pareti, the president of Airline Economics Inc., a Washington-based consulting firm, was asked to help arrange financing for a group that wanted to start an airline.
Mr. Pareti, who had helped to get People Express and Presidential Airways off the ground, quickly raised a small amount while the owners of the nascent Baltia Air Lines mobilized for hearings at the Department of Transportation. 
 Earlier this month, the group, headed by Igor Dmitrowsky, a Latvian immigrant, hit the jackpot: Baltia won the right to fly from New York to Riga, Latvia, to become only the fourth American carrier with routes between the United States and the Soviet Union.
Now, Mr. Pareti seems on the verge of landing enough money to buy Baltia its first planes. In recent days, he has been working with the Waterford Group, a Texas-based investment concern that has told Baltia it may soon put together a $150 million package of loans. An announcement is expected this week.
Mr. Pareti left People Express in January 1985 as it was being taken over by Texas Air and helped start Presidential Air that year. Because of a major buildup by United and Continental airlines at Presidential's hub, Dulles International Airport outside Washington, the carrier was forced to liquidate.
Mr. Pareti, 43, has been named vice chairman and acting vice president of finance for Baltia. But he does not plan to stay with the carrier for long; instead, he said, he would remain at Airline Economics, where he is a principal investor. Baltia has given the firm 4.8 percent of its stock in return for his help.
